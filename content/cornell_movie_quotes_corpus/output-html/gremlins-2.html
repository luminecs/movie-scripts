<h1 id="gremlins-2">gremlins-2</h1>
<p><strong>clamp</strong>: Good morning, Mister Wing. Let’s out through
to key issues, okay? I’m prepared to increase my offer
substantially.</p>
<p>****: Now, Mister Wing, you’re attached to your business. I
appreciate that. I’m attached to my own business. I develop the biggest
buildings in New York, and you sell, ah, little things. Fine. But I’m
not just talking about money here. On the big-screen TV, the IMAGE
widens to incim a an easel beside Clam , holding an architect’s RENDER
that shows the grandiose of a huge office building,..</p>
<p><strong>clamp</strong>: Take a look, Mister Wing –</p>
<p>****: “The Clamp Chinatown Center – Where Business Gets Oriented.”
When I put up a building, it’s the biggest – it’s the newest – it’s the
best. People are going to be killing each other to get into this
building – The soft O.S. TWITTERING of Gizmo is heard from the rear
alcove of the store.</p>
<p><strong>gizmo</strong>: Tee vee!</p>
<p><strong>clamp</strong>: Now,’we’ve been able to reach an
understanding with everyone on the block – except for you. Let me show
you what I willing to do for you – a s tand and souvenir cone on, right
here under the at The foot traffic thrr here is going to make the
building look like a ghost town.</p>
<p><strong>clamp</strong>: Please IF us know when you’ve made a
decision, Mister Wing. You know, I believe that there’s always an area
of agreement that two people can reach. The Clamp Corporation’s LOGO a
stylized “C” – fills the wereen, replacing Clamp’s image.</p>
<p><strong>mr. wing</strong>: Yes – a man can always agree with others.
It is more difficult to agree with oneself.</p>
<p><strong>forster</strong>: Does that mean you – He’s interrupted as
Mr. Wing COUGHS – a rattling spasm that sounds deeply unhealthy. When
the coughing subsides, he answers Forster.</p>
<p><strong>mr. wing</strong>: I’m sorry. Please tell Mister Clamp that
the answer is no.</p>
<p><strong>forster</strong>: Keep the TV. As Mr. Wing walks Clamp’s men
to the door in b.g., HOLD on the TV set – and a small, furry PAW that
reaches into FRAME to change the TV CHANNEL. With the change of
stations, the TV screen fills with a SCENE from a Rambo picture.
SYLVESTER STALLONE addresses the movie</p>
<p><strong>stallone</strong>: To survive a war… you’ve got to become
war. Then he screws an explosive-filled metal ARROWHEAD onto an arrow,
and SHOOTS the arrow from a bow. The arrow hits a HELICOPTER, which
bursts into FLAMES.</p>
<p><strong>gizmo</strong>: Neat!</p>
<p><strong>mr. wing</strong>: Television again! Ai-vuh !. An - invention
for fools.</p>
<p><strong>cd</strong>: As he starts COUGHING again,</p>
<p><strong>bodyguard</strong>: I’m sorry that didn’t work out, sir. I
thought he’d like the TV.</p>
<p><strong>forster</strong>: You hear that cough? The guy must be eighty
– maybe ninety. We can wait.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Mister Wing’ ath removes the last obstacl
eveloper Daniel Clamp’s long- ehinatown project…</p>
<p><strong>producer</strong>: “is Then we go to the boss – The video
IMAGE SWITCHES to Clamp being interviewed behind his spotless, high-tech
desk.</p>
<p><strong>clamp</strong>: .obviously a sad occasion, but the bright
side is that we can go ahead with something that will mean a great deal
to the community down there…</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: That old guy had some neat stuff in his
store. You think they’ll auction it off, or…?</p>
<p><strong>producer</strong>: Nash…I hear they’re just gonna tear it
down.</p>
<p><strong>11 a billboard 11</strong>: showing the ostentatious
structure Daniel Clamp is building on the grave of Mr. Wing’s stare. The
copy reads “COMING SOON -CLAMP CHINATOWN CENTER - Where Business Gets
Oriented.” On the cut, there is MUSIC – a rap song such as Grandmaster
Flash’s “The Message.”</p>
<p><strong>grandmaster flash</strong>: It’s like a jungle sometimes, It
makes me wonder How I keep from going under…</p>
<p><strong>0 11 continueds 11</strong>: As MAIN TITLES begin, PAN DOWN
to</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I should be finished by six tonight. If we go
straight from work, we can make the Early Bird Special at the
movies.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: It’s going to be close. Maybe we could do it
tomorrow – no, tomorrow’s when the Futtermans are</p>
<p><strong>s</strong>: coming to town.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Mister Futterman must be getting better, if he
can travel.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: His wife says he’s getting better. He’s just
been – rattled.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I guess having a bunch of monsters drive a
snow plow through jour living room could kind of that to you. He almost
got kied.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Right. We’re gonna be late,</p>
<p><strong>taxi driver</strong>: You goin’ a’ the airport?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: No, the – The taxi ROARS away – Billy lets go
of the door handle just in time.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Billy…I don’t think we’re getting the hang of
New York.</p>
<p><strong>13a</strong>: FOLLOW Billy and Kate as they approach the
Clamp office building, where we saw guys editing videotape earlier.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I’ll try and get out early tonight. I have to
finish that drawing of the Chinatown building… You know, I -had the
whole thing just right they’re making we take twent p ies off the World
Trade Center ofjbVilding looks bigger. Z? F</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: A lot of people aren’t as thered by that kind
of thing as you are, Billy.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Yeah, no kidding…I don’t think I’m getting
that promotion this year.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: That’s okay. We don’t have to wait.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Yeah we do. It wouldn’t feel right, getting
married on the money I’m making now. It’s bad enough that you got me the
job –</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I didn’t get you the job, I just heard about
it. Billy, you can get promoted and stuff if you want to, but you have
to act like you deserve it. Let people know you’re there.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Want to try the revolving doors today? Before
Kate can answer, a WORKER enters one of the revolving doors. The
power-assisted door, going too fast, WHOOSHES him inside, and we HEAR
–</p>
<p><strong>worker</strong>: Aagghhh!</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Uh-uh. They use a regular door instead.</p>
<p><strong>doreen</strong>: .hope you’ve enjoyed your tour of the
world’s most modern automated office building. Don’t forget, copies of
Mr. Clamp’s best-selling book, I Took Manhattan, are on sale at the
newsstand…</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Don’t let things get to you.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I Won’t.</p>
<p><strong>15 continued: 15</strong>: FOLLOW Billy to a bank of
elevators. He pushes a button, and a “soothing” electronic VOICE
speaks.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Thank you for pushing the button. The
elevator will be here soon. Nearby, CAMERA picks up Daniel Clamp’s
lieutenant Forster. As Forster walks hurriedly through the lobby, his
belt pager</p>
<p><strong>beeps.</strong>: At the sound, Forster changes course,
heading for an ALCOVE offer the lobby, where he unlks_ a cabinet and
opens it ’ -�“eveal it big TV SCREEN with Clamp’s impatient face on it,
and a i&amp;e _ CAMERA on top.</p>
<p><strong>clamp</strong>: Forster, I’ve got the planning commission
people coming in here today. Those condos I want to build, on top of the
Chrysler building? We’rea a close to an okay.</p>
<p><strong>for</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>j</strong>: So I wan A is place running like a clock the
systems, the people, verything.</p>
<p><strong>forster</strong>: Yes sir. I’m doing a decor compliance check
this morning. Tonight I’m doing a random drug search, and – He’s
interrupted as an aging MAN IN A DRACULA COSTUME comes over to the
cabinet and tries to address Clamp over the TV hookup.</p>
<p><strong>grandpa fred</strong>: Excuse me. Mister Clamp, could I speak
with you for a –</p>
<p><strong>forster</strong>: We’re busy.</p>
<p><strong>grandpa fred</strong>: I just need a – Forster snaps the
cabinet shut.</p>
<p><strong>forster</strong>: I said – we’re busy.</p>
<p><strong>16 angle - billy at elevators 16</strong>: As the elevator
doors open, Billy is joined by MARLA, the chain-smoking, New Yorked-out
head of his department.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Billy –</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Hi, Marla, how –</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Your Chinatown drawing. We have to have it.
It’s a crisis panic emergency. The printers are killing us –</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Yeah, I just have to – They get on the
elevator, with other WORKERS. The doors close.</p>
<p><strong>elevator voo</strong>: Please state your desired floor
number.</p>
<p><strong>marla worker</strong>: I’ve got thirty- screaming at me for –
Sixt–</p>
<p><strong>elevator voice</strong>: Your request is floor thirty-two.
Digital NUMBERS flash past on the elevator’s display.</p>
<p><strong>worker</strong>: No, no, not thirty–</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Don’t – But it’s too late.</p>
<p><strong>elevator voice</strong>: You have cancelled floor thirty-two.
The elevator violently STOPS SHORT, tossing everybody around.</p>
<p><strong>elevator voice</strong>: Please state your new desired floor
number.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: 0 Sixteen. I hate this thing. The elevator
stops at their floor, and the doors open. Billy follows Marla out into
18 INT. OFFICE AREA.—-’’s 18 The advertising department of Daniel
Clamp’s empire occupies modern, “open-plan” offices – endless beige
partitions form tiny CUBICLES full of “ergonomic” furniture. Unseen
speakers pipe in “WHITE NOISE” – low-volume static to insulate
conversations.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Listen, this deadline. Its not my fault.
They’re making me miserable so I have to make you miserable. It’s a
complete heart attack disaster horgor story. As Billy and Marla walk, t
ass a WORKER who’s -t4ing to get a drink from the d ar ygr WATER_ When
he pushes the button, the f ain’ss ,got’ VERSHOOTS by several inches,
SPLASHING onto The worker contorts himself to get, a drink,,b is face
SPLASHED when the fountain surges. Billy and Marla a4lie at Billy’s
cubicle, whose “work station” consists of a dra g board and several
drawers. The PHONE is equipped with a VIDEO SCREEN. SPOT a small,
struggling POTTED PLANT, and, pinned to the cubicle wall, Billy’s
DRAWING of the main street of Kingston Falls. On Billy’s drawing board
is an illustration of Clamp’s projected Chinatown building – _a l s
monstrosity with insane pagoda touches. But Billy has tried to breathe
some’ 3 e into it, wit r T the street, kids flying dragon kites, etc.
Marla looks over Billy’s shoulder at the drawing.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: It’s almost finished. I just have to make
some –</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: That courtyard looks cold. That’d be nicer
with the trees.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Are they going to plant trees 40 there?</p>
<p><strong>i1a.</strong>: 18 CX INu : 18</p>
<p><strong>0 marla</strong>: No, but you’re going to draw them.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: But, Maria —-</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Elms.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Right. He’s about to sit down to work, when
Daniel Clamp’s lieutenant Forster and his clipboard-carrying ASSISTANT
come down the row of cubicles, looking around.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Hi, Mister Forster. Forster nods at Marla,
runs an eye over Billy’s cubicle.</p>
<p><strong>forster</strong>: It looks like somebody hasn’t employee
manual…d ’ 1 it, r As he speaks, Forster opens a �therette folder and
takes out a bar-code reading WAND attached to the folder by curly cable.
He runs the wand over the bar-code on Billy’s chest, and reads from an
LCD display in the 0 folder.</p>
<p><strong>forster</strong>: – Peltzer.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Uh, what’s –</p>
<p><strong>forster</strong>: Unauthorized potted plant – possible aphid
infestation. As Forster’s assistant jots on his clipboard, Billy puts
the plant in a desk drawer, and Forster spots Billy’s drawing on his
partition.</p>
<p><strong>forster</strong>: What ig this?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: My home town.</p>
<p><strong>forster</strong>: Mister Peltier, do you know how much the
Clamp organization has spent to provide its employees with art by
recognized artists at this facility?</p>
<p><strong>forster</strong>: Eye-resting. Color-coordinated.
Authorized,</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Yes air. It was just a –</p>
<p><strong>forster</strong>: A little touch, yes. Maybe eyerybods here
would like to do some little touches. Coffee mugs that say “World’s
Greatest Lover.” The cute little hula doll they bought in Hawaii. The
“Snoopy” comic that just says it JJ1. You’d like that, wouldn’t qu,
Mister Peltzer? d 1</p>
<p>****: i don t see any –</p>
<p><strong>forster</strong>: Coming to work every day in a Jy_Q hundred
million dollar flea marks XZZ He turns to move on. 0</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: With a “z,” right? As the assistant
follows Forster away, Billy puts his drawing of Kingston Falls in a
pocket. Marla stews.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Billy, this is Just what I don’t need right
now. Do you realize we’ve got department review in three weeks? This is
a nuclear meltdown disaster, I mean it.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Sorry, Marla.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: The Clamp Centre is the most advanced “smart
building” in America, with the latest, in security, communications, and
climate control. If you’ll follow me over here… Still talking, she takes
them toward a STAIRCASE.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: The Clamp Centre is just one part of Mister
Clamp’s round-the-world business network, which includes construction,
sports, finance, and a popular line of jams and jellies…and, of course,
as those of you who have cable TV at home know, the Clamp Cable Network.
20 INT. CABLE STUDIOS 4,t1iOL ROOM 20 CLOSE on a VIDEO IMAGE oft v With
Marge show. MARGE 0 takes a dish from one of many ’ r ovens on her
set.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: .some people have written in to say that, if
they’re serving these dishes in a dark room, maybe for those romantic
occasions, they notice a glow coming from some of the meat courses. Now,
that’s perfectly normal… REVEAL that this image is on a control-room
monitor at the Clamp Cable studios. Billy, carrying a shopping bag,
passes the control roomand turns down a narrow hallway.</p>
<p><strong>grandpa fred</strong>: .tonight’s movie is so scary – the
people who saw it when it came out in the theaters twelve years ago are
just learning how to speak simple phrases and eat solid food again!
That’s right’. Talk about scary’ It’s a good thing your Grandpa Fred is
here with you – He waits for something he expected to hear, but it
doesn’t happen. He breaks character.</p>
<p><strong>grandpa fred</strong>: Where’s the moan?</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: The what?</p>
<p><strong>grandpa fa</strong>: The moan. There’s posed to be a moan,
from t ck, and I say, “Oh, Renfield, y a o u want some more flies, don’t
you,” and I go back there and open the door –</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Oh. Sorry, Fred. Can somebody find the
tape with the moan? Grandpa Fred sits down, disgusted. Billy goes over
to him.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Hi, Fred. Hey, I was sorry to hear about your
new time slot. I think they’re making a big mistake.</p>
<p><strong>grandpa fred</strong>: A mistake? Kid. it’s a disaster.
People that watch TV at three-thirty in the morning are not scared of
the Wolfman. The only thing that scares those people is getting sober
and finding work.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Yeah. I brought you something.</p>
<p><strong>21 continued: 21</strong>: Billy reaches into his shopping
bag, and pulls out a mechanized BAT that flaps its wings as Billy pulls
the trigger. Grandpa Fred recoils.</p>
<p><strong>grandpa fred</strong>: Watch it with that thing. Billy puts
the bat on top of a cobwebbed TV SET that’s part of Grandpa Fred’s
set.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I thought it would look good over here.</p>
<p><strong>grandpa fred</strong>: Frankly, kid, this was not what I had
in mind. I went Into broadcasting, I wanted to do news. Public affairs.
Something meaningful.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Horror movies can be meaningful, Fred. You
should run some of the classics – Frankenstein, m a cula…</p>
<p><strong>grandpa fred</strong>: All the great horror movies are in
black and white. Mister Clamp only likes color. I donky ven have a
gimmick. No species effects. A puppet that c s out of a box –
whoopee.</p>
<p><strong>director o</strong>: We’ve got the moan, Fred. A listless,
anemic MOAN is heard through the P.A.</p>
<p><strong>grandpa fred</strong>: That’s the moan?</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: That’s what we’ve got, Fred. And… rolling…
Grandpa Fred gamely goes back into character.</p>
<p><strong>grandpa fred</strong>: Oh, Renfield, you want some –</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: Lunch, everybody. Sorry, Fred. We’ll pick it up
right there.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: You should run some of the classics, Fred –
FFAnkenstein, Dracula …</p>
<p><strong>grandpa fred</strong>: All the great horror movies are in
black and white. Mister Clamp only likes color. That guy is str___._.
ange.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: You’ve seen him?</p>
<p><strong>grandpa fred</strong>: Well, of in person, but – just to this
building. You know wha V t nd f tenants they have here? There’ esearch
laboratory upat t2 – tenet,] c research. Foolin d with animals, cutting
thl .last</p>
<p><strong>3 f</strong>: week, they took out a patent on a new kind of
gerbil. People think Ia creepy.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Well – I wanted to get away from Kingston
Falls. I guess I did.</p>
<p><strong>grandpa fred</strong>: You. got that right, kid. Have you
heard these voices they have here now? Don’t look at me like that. You
know that white noise they play all the time? The static?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Yeah. That’s so they can put people close
together and they won’t overhear each other. You’re not supposed to
notice it.</p>
<p><strong>grandpa fred</strong>: Sure. But if you listen to it – there
are little voices in there.</p>
<p><strong>grand fred</strong>: That’s what th Id’s coming to, kid. You
can’t talk to yourself without ebody interrupting.</p>
<p><strong>forster</strong>: Let me hear the voices. The technician
brings up VOICES on a speaker. They sound like voice-overs on slick TV
commercials.</p>
<p><strong>announcers’ voices</strong>: .I’m an honest kind of guy – and
not stealing office supplies works for me, and e way I live today…</p>
<p><strong>0</strong>: When I save m ’ the Clamp organization, I fe go4
about myself all over… You know, I’ve been thinkin Mister Clamp would
make a great president…</p>
<p><strong>forster</strong>: That’s fine –</p>
<p><strong>a technician</strong>: It’s for you, sir. Forster turns to
see a technician pointing at a MONITOR showing CLAMP’S FACE. Forster
greets the screen.</p>
<p><strong>forster</strong>: Yes, Mister Clamp.</p>
<p><strong>clamp</strong>: I’m going to a meeting about the Vermont
thing. It looks like that takeover is going to happen.</p>
<p><strong>forster</strong>: That’s terrific, sir.</p>
<p><strong>clamp</strong>: No kidding. How many guys do you know that
have their own state? Did I show you that picture of the mountains?</p>
<p><strong>forster</strong>: Yes sir. Tall!</p>
<p><strong>clamp</strong>: While I’m in there, get that revolving door
fixed downstairs. It shorted out last night while I had some money
people here. Mrs. Tanaka is still spinning.</p>
<p><strong>forster</strong>: I’ll – But a Camp LOGO ;ills the monitor
screen, and Clamp’s face disappe rs behipo- it. Forster turns and looks
over a technician’s shoulder at a MONITOR. A spy CAMERA shows a
stressed-out EMPLOYEE lighting a cigarette in a STOREROOM.</p>
<p>****: 0 Forster punches button on the cinsole, picks up a microphone
and talks into it:</p>
<p>****: That’s an unaut iz,pd break period, pal. a don’t work here
anymore. On the monitor, the startled employee looks around for the

<p><strong>forster</strong>: We have a problem communicating here?
You’re gone. Clean out the desk. One hour. Thanks so much. He puts down

<p><strong>forster</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: There’s not much air in the building,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>forster</strong>: At four o’clock, people go into a slump.
Then we give them oxygen,</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: Yes air.</p>
<p><strong>peggy 11.0</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>messenger</strong>: Yeah, got a delivery here.. He follows
her back to</p>
<p><strong>messenger</strong>: What kind of stuff do they do-ft there,
anyway?</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: We’re not supposed to talk about it.</p>
<p><strong>messenger</strong>: Huh. This is for Doctor Catheter.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: I can sign for it.</p>
<p><strong>messenger</strong>: Okay. This copy’s yours. Thanks.
Whistling Gizmo’s tune again, the messenger leaves the office – almost
running into DR. CATHETER, Splice-o-Life’s chief scientist, who’s on his
way in.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: Doctor Catheter, this just came for you.</p>
<p><strong>dr. catheter</strong>: Oh, good. This might be my malaria…
No, this is just rabies. I have rabies. And I was supposed to get the
flu this week.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: I think the flu is on b;Eo -order. She takes
out a Kleenex, blows he holds his hand out. Q</p>
<p><strong>dr. cathete</strong>: May I have that, Peg</p>
<p>****: Oh, uh – sure… Dr. Catheter takes the Kleenex, and heads for
the inner office.</p>
<p><strong>dr. catheter</strong>: Back order. All a man wants is some
fresh germs… FOLLOW Catheter back to</p>
<p><strong>dr. catheter</strong>: Hello, Wally. Your lights are
flickering again.</p>
<p><strong>0 25 continuedi 25</strong>: Wally’s eyes are BLINKING in
precise synch with the flickering of the fluorescent bulbs.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: Are they? Dr. Catheter turns to a table where
several different potted vegetable PLANTS are att ed to collecting tubes
that feed into a central glass VIAL. DR. CAfTER How are we doing on a
vegetable medley plant, Wally talked to the Bird’s-Eye peopl ain.
They’re very excited . Wally nods, sighing – the long-sgff ring
researcher.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: We came close yesterday, Doctor. But it
rejected the pimento.</p>
<p><strong>dr. catheter</strong>: You’ll get it, Wally.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: I’m very pleased about this bat project,
though… He leads Catheter toward a group of ANIMAL CAGES,</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: You know, in some parts of the world, there
are millions of bats. They could make terrific messengers, like
pigeons…</p>
<p><strong>dr. catheter</strong>: Yes, but they only come out at
night.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: That’s what we’re working on, sir. They
arrive at a cage where a resting BAT hangs upside down. An intravenous
TUBE, sticking out of the bat’s flesh, is connected to a drip bottle
whose label bears a shining SUN logo.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: This is a formula of vitamins,</p>
<p><strong>dr. catheter</strong>: Very nice. Catheter draws closer to
Wally, and speaks with creepy</p>
<p><strong>dr. theter</strong>: I believe sow them feed on…�g�. %</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: Oh, uh – that’s fferent bat, Doctor. South
Amen.</p>
<p>****: Ah. Well, good work, lly… Catheter moves on. Another SCIENTIST
approaches Wally in b.g.</p>
<p><strong>scientist</strong>: 0 Wally, could you let me have some
growth hormone? I’m a little short. FOLLOW Catheter to another side of
the lab, where two more SCIENTISTS are at work. One of them greets
Catheter, while the other has his back to us at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>dr. catheter</strong>: Hello, Lewis.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: Hi, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>dr. catheter</strong>: How’s that cloning work coming? Martin
turns around. He is Lewis’s IDENTICAL TWIN.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: R R e l_ well, Doctor. The twins talk in
rapid e nation, as if they share a brain. LEWIS t A Say, Doctor, look
at</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: .I think you’ll find it interesting.
Following the SOUND of the crooning that caught the messenger’s
attention, they take Catheter over to a lab table where the LIGHTS ARE
LOWERED above a covered cage. Martin pulls back the cloth to reveal
GIZMO, who stops singing and looks up at them.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: Some sort of rodent, apparently…</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: .and it can’t take bright light.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: Watch this, Doctor. He opens the side door of
Gizmo’s cage and turns on a TAPE PLAYER. Hearing the bouncy ROCK MUSIC,
Gizmo playfully DANCES out of the cage as the scientists talk.</p>
<p><strong>dr. catheter</strong>: Hmp! Qu-te, isn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: That may be genetic…</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: .we’re not sure yet. But as he amuses his
captors, Gizmo is slyly looking around for a way out of here. He edges
farther away from the cage…</p>
<p><strong>dr. catheter</strong>: Not so fast, pal. He abruptly switches
the MUSIC off, and GRABS Gizmo just before the Mogwai can make good his
escape. Dr. Catheter sticks the frightened Gizmo back in the cage, and
shuts the side door firmly.</p>
<p><strong>dr. catheter</strong>: What’s wrong with you two? He almost
made a break for it.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Sorry, sir</p>
<p><strong>dr. catheter</strong>: How are you going to pro, with
him?</p>
<p><strong>lewis 113</strong>: Cell samples tomorr</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: .tissue culture hursday.</p>
<p><strong>dr. catheter</strong>: And then there’s body structure. And
for that, my little friend… The three scientists LOOM over the terrified
Gizmo. Dr. Catheter reaches into the cage to give Gizmo a POKE.</p>
<p><strong>dr. catheter</strong>: .we’ll just have to cut you.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Hell. The WORKER in the next cubicle speaks
up.</p>
<p><strong>cubicle neighbor</strong>: Jump around.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>cubicle neighbor</strong>: You sat still for too long. The
building thinks you left. It’s saving energy. Jump around. Billy jumps
around, and the LIGHTS come back on, as the messenger who visited the
genetics lab comes to the Cubicle Neighbor’s desk with a package.</p>
<p><strong>messenger</strong>: Package for you.</p>
<p><strong>cubicle neighbor</strong>: Oh. Thanks. But as the Cubicle
Neighbor signs the� whistles to himself – Gizmo’s song min, in that sad
minor. For a moment, Billy doesn’t regis t – and then CAMERA catches the
realization dawningQ� s face, as he looks over the cubicle partition and
asks ijr’lntly:</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Where did you heaA-11; at?</p>
<p><strong>messenger</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: That music. Where did you hear it?</p>
<p><strong>messenger</strong>: Oh, uh –</p>
<p>****: Dah dah, dah dah dah dah – isn’t that by Sting?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: No. It’s not by Sting. Think. Where did you
–</p>
<p><strong>messenger</strong>: Oh, hey – I know. I was up in that
laboratory, you know, on eighteen, and somebody was, like, humming it
–</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Did you see who it was?</p>
<p><strong>messenger</strong>: Nuh-uh, it was in the back – Billy takes
off.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: How you doin’? I bear your copier’s down.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: Oh. Hi. It’s back in ther4.</p>
<p><strong>29 angle - scientists 29</strong>: Martin and Lewis have
clipped ELECTRODES to the EARS of a nervous-looking RAT. They’re
preparing to throw the toggle switch of a strange-looking DEVICE
connected to the electrodes, as Dr. Catheter looks on.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: This is the most interesting bio- electrical
work I’ve ever been involved in. Here you go, boy… He FEEDS the rat some
liquid from a VIAL with a LIGHTNING-BOLT insignia on its label.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: Think of it…millions of rats in New York, and
everyone hates them…</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: But if one of them could power a portable
radio for a month… He throws the switch. The rat’s eyes WIDEN, then calm
down as the current goes off. Dr. Catheter touches the rat, and quickly
pulls his hand back from the electric SHOCK.</p>
<p><strong>dr. catheter</strong>: Definite progress, fellows. if we
could just make it safe to touch them…</p>
<p><strong>martin and lewis</strong>: Hmm…</p>
<p><strong>angle - billy</strong>: He wanders back to the corner zmo’s
voice is coming from. Two caged MONKEYS chatter at lm as he passes.</p>
<p><strong>f</strong>: Billy, whistling, lifts the cTiver on the wrong
cage. He drops it in shock as he gets a GLIMPSE of a growth-hormone
experiment: a hairy SPIDEbout twelve inches across. Then, as Gizmo’s
singin news, Billy’s eyes fall on the right covered cage – and theeaming
SCALPELS arranged next to it. Billy heads back to the copying machine.
On the way, he flips the latch on the monkeys’ cage – – and is back at
the copier in time to look up, “surprised,” as the excited monkeys
scamper past his into the center of the lab, distracting the scientists
–</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: Theodore! What are you doing out?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Alvin! Put down that DNA! As the scientists
chase the monkeys, Billy hurries to Gizmo’s cage. He opens the cage, and
HIS EYES MEET GIZMO’S – it’s hard to say which of then is more excited.
But the gala reunion will have to wait. Billy scoops Gizmo into his
toolbox. He walks out of the lab, leaving the copier a mess.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Hey, guy…did you miss me? Gizmo does EYE
MOVEMENTS – shyly hedging, then admitting it.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Yeah, me too. Let’s put you up here. We don’t
want to get any water on you.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: That bad, huh? How did you get in there? What
happened to Mister Wing? Gizmo looks sad – indicates his armband.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Oh. I’m sorry. But then – He stops at a
sudden SOUND – VOICES in the anteroom between the bathroom and the
hail.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Quick – get in here. He slips Gizmo into the
tool box, above his protesting TWITTERS.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Sshh – just wait a minute –</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: Billy sets about furiously washing his hands,
just as Forster comes into the bathroom. Billy doesn’t see him standing
there, until he shakes water off his hands –</p>
<p><strong>forster</strong>: You’re wetting my shoes, Peltzer. Billy
sees Forster, sees the shoes, grabs a paper towel and is about to drop
to his knees.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I’m sorry, sir – let me –</p>
<p><strong>forster</strong>: Stand up, Peltzer. Come with me. Billy
grabs the tool box and follows Forster out the door. As they go into the
anteroom, Forster’s clipboard-carrying ASSISTANT joins them. #</p>
<p><strong>forster</strong>: Do you know what that eans, Peltzer?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: It means “men’s bathroom.”</p>
<p><strong>forster</strong>: What is the man holding?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: In the bathroom?</p>
<p><strong>forster</strong>: On the sign, Peltzer.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Oh. A little briefcase, sir.</p>
<p><strong>forster</strong>: That’s right. Because this – is the
executive washroom. I don’t think you belong in there, do you
Peltzer?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Oh. Well. My mistake –</p>
<p><strong>0 42 continued: 42</strong>: Forster whips the bar-code
reader wand out of his leatherette folder, runs it over Billy’s chest
insignia again, and pushes a BUTTON in the folder. A calculator-type
PRINTOUT churns out of the gadget, and Forster looks it over.</p>
<p>****: Lateness infractions… and these SAT scores –</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: That’s in there? Forster snaps the folder
shut. Gizmo, restless, RATTLES the tool box.</p>
<p><strong>forster</strong>: What’s in the box, Peltzer?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Oh, uh – art supplies. I’m mixin ’ nts. Well,
I better get back t 1 here –</p>
<p><strong>forster</strong>: Hm. I think our “random” drug search later
on should be very interesting.</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: Got it, sir.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Gizmo, you’ve got to be quiet. You don’t want
to go back to that laboratory, do you?</p>
<p><strong>e billy</strong>: We’ll go home soon, and –</p>
<p><strong>4? continued: 43</strong>: Maria moves quickly to greet him,
and they meet beside Billy’s cubicle.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Mister Clamp – sir, I’m Marla Bloodstone, I’m
the department head here, if there’s anything I can –</p>
<p><strong>clamp</strong>: That’s okay. Everybody just relax, and go
back to what you’d be doing normally. I know I haven’t been down here
before, but that’s going to change. I’m going to be a little more
“hands-on” with these operations from now on… As he speaks, Clamp
glances over Billy’s shoulder, and spots the Chinatown drawing.</p>
<p>****: Hey, t.h,s is ex 1A</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: This?</p>
<p><strong>clamp</strong>: You’ve captured the whole essence of the
project here. Look at the kids with the kites. That’s warmth. I like
warmth. What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Peltzer. Billy – Bill Peltzer. Marla watches,
saucer-eyed, as Clamp shakes hands with Billy.</p>
<p><strong>clamp</strong>: That’s what we need here. People who produce.
Let’s lose these elm trees, though. People think “elm,” they think
“Dutch,” “disease” – Gizmo’s drawer rattles open. Billy snaps it
shut.</p>
<p><strong>clamp</strong>: What’s with that drawer?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Oh, it’s, uh – it’s automatic. It opens up
now and then, in case you need anything.</p>
<p><strong>clamp</strong>: Huh. I didn’t know about that one. He moves
on, nodding vaguely at Marla – who goes over to Billy, looking at him
through completely new eyes.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Did you hear that? “People who produce. I’ve
been working here six years, and I’ve never even seen him in person.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Well – he likes the drawing</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: This is big, Billy. T i.s career
opportunity,q4 cement window.For both</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Clearly. We can talk about it at dinner.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Oh. That soundsgreat. I could do it, let’s
see…</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Tonight.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: No, I can’t tonight. I’ve got – an
appointment.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: I’ve got something tonight too, Billy. A
brochure for the Clamp Cable Archery Channel. It’s a total suicide
trauma red alert deadline situation. And you know what? I’m letting it
go to have dinner with you.</p>
<p><strong>e billy</strong>: I just don’t think I can –</p>
<p><strong>40 43 continued: 43</strong>: His desk drawer starts RATTLING
again. Billy shoves it firmly closed.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: What ,g with that drawer, Billy? I know every
feature in this building. We don’t have anything that opens itself.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Oh – I knocked against it with my leg, I was
–</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Billy, are you keeping some kind of ppI in
there? It’s a good thing Mister Clamp likes you so much, because –</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: A pet? No, no, I’m alle $,; MARLA ,  l Let.me
see. Come</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: You know – I think if we leave right now, I
could go to dinner. Just a quick one –</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Great. There’s this very chic new restaurant.
It’s Canadian. They clean the fish right at your table.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Sounds terrific.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Let me just grab my coat, and I’ll be right
back. As Marla goes O.S., Billy slips Gizmo’s drawer open and talks into
it.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Gizmo…I have to go now. Just wait here, okay?
Just stay put for a few minutes and – He hurriedly closes the drawer as
Marla approaches.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Ready?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Yeah. He grabs his sportcoat, and follows
Maria toward the elevators. As they go, CAMERA HOLDS on Gizmo’s drawer.
It slowly shakes i open, and the curious Mogwai’s eyes and ears come
into view, i checking out the world of Billy’s office. Gizmo ducks back
out of sight …but, a moment later, a CHAIN OF LARGE PAPER CLIPS is
tossed down from the drawer, making a ladder to the floor. As Gizmo
starts hoisting himself over the edge of the drawer,</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Uh – could you excuse me a second? I’ll be
right back. Sure. Billy heads for an alcove at the</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Hi! I’m almost ready –</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Iii.. Listen, Xate –</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Nothing. Um, nothing’s wrong, but I can’t go
out tonight. I have a — meeting. With some people.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Oh, damn.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I know. I’m sorry. But it’s good E for – what
we were talking about, you know? Letting people know I’m there and
everything?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: In the middle of the night?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Kate, I need you to do something for me.
Gizmo’s here.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: It’s a long story – I’ll explain it later.
He’s up in my desk drawer. You have to take him home.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Take him ham? Billy, this is nuts. If those
things start running around in New York –</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: There won’t be any “thin ust remember the
rules. H a ’’.t take bright light – a ec sunlight. It, 1 his. And you
can’t get wat him. And the most important thing – never feed</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Can’t he Just – go back where you found
his?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: No. I have to go to this – meeting. Please –
I’ll be home as soon as I can, A beat.</p>
<p>****: Okay. Let me take this stuff off and punch out, and then I’ll
go get his.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Great. Thanks. He gives her a quick kiss, and
leaves the tour guides’ office. Kate waits a moment, then looks out into
the lobby… 44A INT. LOBBY - KATE’S POV 44A i .and sees Billy leaving the
building with Marla.</p>
<p><strong>s</strong>: the top edge from inside.</p>
<p><strong>c</strong>: CAMERA MOVES IN on the cabinet drawer, and the
first two new Mogwais are revealed, standing in the drawer: GEORGE AND
LENNY, an inseparable pair. Lenny is big, dumb, and loyal, while George
is small, with a criminal caginess – he gets Lenny to do everything for
him. Gizmo watches the wastebasket where the third furball landed start
to ROCK back and forth – but is distracted as the BOUNCING FURBALL hits
the floor in front of him, then ricochets up onto a DESKTOP. To SOUND FX
of a bowling ball hitting the pins, the furball rolls into a desk
corner, and the third Mogwai unfolds – upside-down. This is DAFFY, a
dizzy, uncontrollably antic Mogwai with the demented juvenile Joie de
vivre we associate with the great Daffy Duck. In the first seconds
following birth, Daffy goes daffy over the very fact of being alive. He
sees his little hands and feet unfold,. and gives a WHOOP</p>
<p>****: Waco ! – as Gizmo watches the ra,k n :,wa t basket TIP OVER.
Looking into the basket, we SE ` umble of office wastepaper, which is
violently toss e ut… .until MOHAWK, the fourth new Mogwai, emerges. This
guy is pure, malicious evil, a new strain of badness. Even as a furry
Mogwai, he’s about as cuddly as a cockroach. While Daffy, up on the
desktop, starts playing with everything in sight… .Mohawk, on the floor,
moves in on Gizmo.</p>
<p><strong>gizmo</strong>: Uh-oh. George and Lenny drop down to the
carpet to join Mohawk, as Gizmo – standing now – backs away. There’s a
grated VENT opening low on the wall behind him. Lenny grabs Gizmo with a
fast-moving paw, and Mohawk, moving in close, SPITS in Gizmo’s eyes.</p>
<p><strong>4 8aa angle - billy’s cubicle window 48aa</strong>: Through
the glass WINDOW of Billy’s cubicle, we HEAR Daffy acting up –</p>
<p><strong>daffy</strong>: Wa-hogs !</p>
<p><strong>4 8b. angle - gizmo and mogwais as before 48b 1</strong>:
George points to the vent opening behind Gizmo, and WHISPERS to Lenny.
Lenny nods his dumb understanding, and YANKS the force- fit GRATE out of
the wall. He clumsily bumps George with the grate, and George SLAPS
him.</p>
<p><strong>4 8bbb tnt. hallway - angle on vent 48bbb</strong>: Gizmo
looks out mi ’jra.bly though the vent… .and CAMERA pulls V8
tk’from-,him, to show the FEET of departing humans, who are oblivious
to-:the strange, imprisoned creature a -, few feet away..</p>
<p><strong>forster</strong>: Hah! Good boy! I knew we’d find something
in this guy’s desk – – but as they reach Billy’s desk, they find Daffy’s
paint PAW PRINTS tracking crazily over every surface. The dog keeps
going bananas, but it’s not drugs he smells – it’s the dander of the
recently departed Daffy.</p>
<p><strong>forster</strong>: Look at this mess! What kind of footprints
are these?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Hard to say, sir. A possible</p>
<p><strong>c</strong>: gerbil.</p>
<p><strong>forster</strong>: He’s bringing pets to work. I don’t believe
this guy-it’s not just plants. He’s got to have 1,_. e s t ock .</p>

<p><strong>53a angle - gizmo in vent 53a</strong>: Gizmo, imprisoned in
the vent, SEES Kate mistaking Daffy for him. He shakes his head,
twitters, points to himself – but he’s too far away to get her
attention.</p>
<p><strong>53b angle - kate and daffy as before 53b</strong>: Kate takes
Daffy out of the drawer, but she’s not happy about this – especially
when Daffy LEERS at her.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Billy said to take you home. You’d better stay
in my purse till we get out of the building.</p>
<p><strong>4o.</strong>: 53B CONTINUEDi 53B She slips his into the
purse, puts it over her shoulder. As gate heads for the exit, an ANGLE
into her purse…</p>

smirking.</p>
<p>****: WahQQ!</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Did you always know you were going to be an
artist?</p>
<p><strong>0 billy</strong>: Well – I always liked to draw. When I was
little, with my crayons, I would do these comic strips, and drawings of
the teachers and stuff…</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: I had crayons too, i y. And when I was four
years old, I was using them to write dos to the other children. Even
then, I knew. C_j</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Hub. That’s somethin</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Isn’t this great? We’ _Jinally getting to
know each otdr. You can’t do that in an office.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Well, in there, everything’s business –</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Right. Now, let’s talk strategy. You realize,
this changes everything – for you, me, the department…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What does?</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Your relationship to Mister Clamp. Your
access. I can see a future, Billy. I see more office space…embossed
letterhead…I see us – – swallowing up the publicity department.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Wow. I’m being open 4th Billy.- haven’t
talked abQu feelings with anyone.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: See, I usually don’t pay too much attention
to office politics and stuff. I have so much work to do on the
illustrations –</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: You have talent, Billy, and that’s wonderful.
It’s a God-given blessing situation. But even an artist has to have
goals.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Definitely. It’s like I was saying to Kate, I
said, Honey, you know, for an artist – Maria leans closer to Billy, her
tone more intimate than before.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: I can help you reach those goals, Billy. If
we join forces…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Oh, we should definitely join – Billy FEELS
something in his lap. He looks down. It is Marla’s stockinged FOOT.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: – forces. Just at that moment –</p>
<p><strong>canadian waiter</strong>: Sir? – a WAITER appears at Billy’s
side, holding a platter containing a large MOOSE HEAD sculpted out of
CHOCOLATE. Billy is so startled to find the moose staring at him that he
SPILLS his beer in his lap. Maria quickly withdraws her foot, and Billy
blots at the spill with a napkin.</p>
<p><strong>canadian waiter</strong>: You okay there, sir? Another Molson
there, eh?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: No, uh, thanks’. Everything’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>ca an waiter</strong>: This is a f Canadian dessert, sir. e
olate moose. Can I out you an an eree?</p>
<p><strong>billy w</strong>: No, thanks, I, uh –I’ve rea y got to get
going. I’ve got that – appointment. I’m sorry about your, uh –</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Oh, that’s okay –</p>
<p><strong>56 continued: 56</strong>: As Billy gets up from the booth,
Marla – not giving up without a fight – grabs his tie. The waiter steps
back, and Marla pulls Billy down close to her, planting a KISS on his
cheek, leaving a lipstick imprint. When Billy slips loose, he finds the
chocolate moose staring at him again.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: – see you tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Good. Right. He escapes the r au rant.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Billy said to make sure and feed you before
midnight… As she arranges chicken and mashed potatoes on a plate, Daffy
spots a BLENDER next to him. He recoils from it – then, with an evil
grin, he shoves it off the counter while Kate’s back is turned, BREAKING
it. When she turns and looks, Daffy has an innocent loops” expression on
his face.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Oh, God-you have to be careful here, okay,
Gizmo? We don’t have the money to replac things. Daffy nods contritely.
Ka ings him the food.</p>
<p><strong>katednt. }</strong>: Let’s see i f CWu ’ l i eat this – Daffy
grabs a chick li�g, opens his mouth as wide as Joe E. Brown’s, clamps 0
-11 n the drumstick, and strips all the meat off in one fast ion,
bringing out a spotless bone. With his other paw, Daffy tries the mashed
potatoes. He hates them, and PITCHES what he’s holding, getting half the
wad on Kate and half on the refrigerator.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I don’t know what Billy sees in you. Daffy
WHOOPS, grabs more chicken, and resumes eating.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Its me. She undoes the deadbolts and opens
the door. Billy rushes in.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Hi. I’m sorry I’m late – He gives her a fast
kiss on the lips – and, as he lets go of her, sees that she’s SPATTERED
with food.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What happened to you? Kate doesn’t answer –
she looking at the LIPSTICK mark on Billy’s face.</p>
<p><strong>k</strong>: Did you har q good meeting?</p>
<p><strong>40 b b illy</strong>: Uh , y it was fine. Where’s</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: It’s in the kitchen. Billy – She FOLLOWS him
to the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Did you feed him?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Yes –</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Hey, Giz, how you – They come into the
kitchen, which is a mess from Daffy’s food, throwing. The Mogwai is
hidden behind a little BARRICADE of Lean Cuisine boxes. As Kate and
Billy enter, he THROWS a lump of frozen pineapple that nails Billy on
the forehead.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Ow! Gizmo, what’s – Billy leans over the
barricade and looks in – as Daffy tosses a GLOP of cherry cobbler,
splattering Billy’s face.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Kate …Kate, where did you find this guy?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: In your office – near that drawer, where you
said – Billy, look out! Too late – Daffy LOBS a single-serving
PUDDING-PACK at Billy. It bursts on impact, staining his shirt.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: � Where’s Gizmo? The Mogwai SPITS, then wings
Kate with a piece of Salisbury steak. Billy looks at the wall clic: it’s
11:15.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: We’ve got to get over here.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Billy – you said there weren’t going to be
those –</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: There won’t be. Not if they don’t eat after
midnight.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: What about – him?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: We’ll have to take him with us. He snatches a
Lean Cuisine box away and grabs Daffy, almost getting bitten in the
process. Kate follows Billy as he takes the flailing Daffy into the
living room and stuffs him into his leather daypack.</p>
<p>****: Wahoo! No! Elbow room! Don’t fence me –</p>
<p><strong>63 continued: 63</strong>: The daypack jumps around wildly as
Billy zips it shut.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: You ever want to get out of there, you better
relax. Daffy settles down to a low rumble.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: That’s better. They grab their coats, start
toward the door.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Mister Wing was right…</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: When he came to take Gizmo back. I asked him
how come he could understand what Gizmo was saying… said you just had to
know how isten. But he said I wasn’t re cW t. For the 0 responsibili d
I’m not – As they reach the door, the �?q x ZZER sounds.</p>
<p><strong>billy 5</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Who could it be this late?</p>
<p><strong>64 new angle 64</strong>: Billy opens the door, and finds
MURRAY FUTTERMAN, the snow plow driver from Gremlins, and his wife
SHEILA.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Mister Futterman! Mrs. Futterman…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: We thought you were coming tomorrow –</p>
<p><strong>mr. futterman</strong>: We thought so too. The guys in my old
outfit, they changed the date for the reunion. We tried to call</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: Thirty-two hours’. We’re sorry to come here
so late –</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: No, no, that’s okay. Would you like some
coffee, or –</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: No, don’t you go to any trouble, hon.</p>
<p><strong>mr. futterman</strong>: Boy, we tried to get a cab up here –
did you know they have RUgsiLan guys drivin’ cabs in this burg? What if
somebody gets in one of those cabs with a briefcase full of atomic
secrets? Is anyone thinking about that?</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: Murray, you remember what Doctor Kaplan
said. We’re going to stay nice and calm – Murray was a little…
distressed after, you know, what happened with those, um –</p>
<p><strong>mr. futterman</strong>: Aah, I’m fine. I was just a little
jumpy for a while – Billy’s daypack SQUEAKS. Billy slips the bag under
his arm and squeezes it, forcibly quieting Daffy.</p>
<p><strong>mr. futterman</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: It’s okay, honey. I hear it too.</p>
<p><strong>mr. furman</strong>: Of course you hea it too. What do you
mean?</p>
<p><strong>bil</strong>: It’s, uh – plumbing here. It…makes n e
sometimes. Sheila, looking at qty, spots something – iE I LA Oh, Mur I
think we interrupt these two.</p>
<p><strong>mr. futterman</strong>: Huh? Billy realizes what Sheila is
talking about, as she takes out a handkerchief and dabs at the lipstick
on his face.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Oh, uh…that’s from – my boss. I did some
stuff that she liked. I mean some work – He tries to catch Kate’s eye,
but she avoids his look.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Uh, the thing is – I’m afraid you guys can’t
stay here. I mean, we’d love it if you could, but the, uh - - the
building’s being – fumigated.</p>
<p><strong>mr. futterman ��</strong>: Bugs, huh? Yeah, you can’t be
careful these days. All k t weird bugs eosin’ into +he country…</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: Oh. Well, that’s okay, Billy –</p>
<p><strong>mr. futterman</strong>: Sure – we’ll just book into a }
hotel.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Really sorry …we’ll call you… He backs the
Futtermans toward the door. AD LIB goodnights as Billy opens the door,
forcing himself to look relaxed as the Futtermans go. He watches through
the door for a beat, then closes it – and finds Kate suspiciously eyeing
his lipstick tattoo.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What – this? It was just one of those
business things. You know, like – “Great job.” You don’t believe me?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I believe you.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: We better get going.</p>
<p><strong>yogurt jerk i</strong>: .so that’s a Kona praline and
banana-berry swirl with kiwis and peanut butter cups?</p>
<p><strong>cu</strong>: Yeah …or, wait”rfre j’t yep peanut butter cups
all nui�</p>
<p><strong>yogurt jerk 1</strong>: 0 I’m not sure…Alexis, are the peanut
butter cups all natural? As Yogurt Jerk 2 joins the discussion, a new
ANGLE finds a furry PAW turning on two spigots on the yogurt machine.
FOLLOW the two streams of goo over the machine’s spill grate and down to
the floor. Hidden from view by the counter, Mohawk, George, and Lenny
reach for the trickling yogurt… .check the lobby CLOCK as the time TICKS
past midnight…</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Yum! .and sloppily chow down. Up above,
Yogurt Jerk I turns to the machine, sees the two spigots flowing. She’s
about to turn them off, but a complaining CUSTOMER stops her.</p>
<p><strong>customer 2</strong>: Miss, I asked for Oreo cookies and Gummy
Bears – this stuff is, like – hair.</p>
<p><strong>yogurt jerk 1</strong>: Ma’am, we don’t have anything that’s
like –</p>
<p><strong>65 continueda 65</strong>: But then Customer 2 and Yogurt
Jerk 2 SEE it at the same time: a furry PAW reaching up to scoop
M&amp;M’s from a topping bin.</p>
<p><strong>customer 2</strong>: What is it? It’s a t.!</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Yum!</p>
<p><strong>customer 3</strong>: What’s going on here? Did that woman say
there are rats?</p>
<p><strong>yogurt jerk 2</strong>: Um, no, sir, she said there are mQ
rats here –</p>
<p><strong>customer 2 ‘“’</strong>: .I don’t just want a different
yogurt, I want d&amp;akrxes –</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What kind of thing was in the trail mix?</p>
<p><strong>customer 1</strong>: I don’t know, a fa= thing. And it’s
supposed to be health food. Billy checks the lobby clock – 12:10. He
Pulls Kate aside.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: That’s it. It’s after midnight, and they’ve
eaten. Now they’ll make their cocoons…and if they get to water –</p>
<p><strong>40 kate</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>67 continued: 67</strong>: She leads him quickly over to the
elevators.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: It’s along here… They come to a deep, square
RECESS in the wall. Inside is massive MACHINERY – pipes, pumps, meters –
surrounded by a</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: This is where the water comes into the
building.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Great. Maybe if we shut it off, they’ll even
close the place down… Billy goes to a corner of the chain-link cage and
starts bending links back from the seam, trying to make a big enough
opening to slip through.</p>
<p><strong>supervisor</strong>: Give me video. The technician types a
command, and a video IMAGE of Billy attacking the cage appears on the
screen.</p>
<p><strong>supervisor</strong>: Guards.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Back off! Put your hds up. Billy backs off
the cage and ss a GUARD coming toward him, flashlight and gun in hand.
As he gets close, Daffy starts bouncing around in the daypaelr again.
The guard trains his gun on the leather bag.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: What’s in the bag pal?,</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Oh yeah? Let’s have a look.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: You don’t want to – The guard ignores him,
opens the zipper, and LOOKS DOWN into the bag.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Aagghhh! When the guard pulls his head up,
Daffy is hanging onto the guard’s NOSE by his teeth. The guard flails
his head furiously around, until Daffy finally flies free –</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: No! – and as the Mogwai’s departing FOOTSTEPS
are heard, the guard angrily puts Billy up against the wall, starts
handcuffing him.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: We have to find him, before he eats something
– GUARD b5 He already ate some i Billy looks around for Kate then
realizes she’s hiding in the 0 shadows of the concrete recess, unnoticed
by the guard.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Look, we have to shut this building down.
That thing that bit you – there are more of them, okay? And they’re
going to turn into – these Monsters, and –</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Tell you what, pal – you can tell the cops
all about these monsters, I’m sure they’ll be very interested… As he
takes Billy away, CAMERA holds on a spot over their heads…goes into a
GAP between the concrete wall and ceiling …and finds three big COCOONS.
Their slimy bodies gleam dully in the yellow lamplight. As we watch, the
cocoons silently GROW and change, gathering strength…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Listen, I’m not crazy. People are going to be
in a lot of danger. They wreck things. They kill people. If they get out
of here, they’ll destroy the whole city…they’ll destroy everything.
Listen to me…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Thanks for getting � e out of there.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: It was easy – I just gave them a next month’s
rent.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: When we get there – go to your job, like
normal, okay? And just keep your eyes open. What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Six-thirty.</p>
<p><strong>4ii</strong>: They hit the early-scorning at a run.</p>
<p><strong>7 2 int . clamp centre - lobby 72</strong>: The early-morning
arrivals are here – PEOPLE opening their lobby businesses. In a SERIES
of SHOTS, they lift the shiny, corrugated-metal security GATES that
protect a NEWSSTAND…an</p>
<p><strong>77 new angle 77</strong>: – and doesn’t see the FLOOR
disappear from under him until he’s already FALLING down a tall vertical
drop, grasping helplessly at the sheer wall that rushes past…</p>
<p><strong>gizmo</strong>: Bil - lee – – but a GREEN CLAW GRABS HIM FROM
BEHIND, jerking him backward, off his feet.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Billy, what if they’re already – Suddenly, the
lobby LIGHTS DIM, d Billy looks up. BILLY t.0 They are. Come on..</p>
<p>****: He starts leading Kate toward e lobby NEWSSTAND. On the way,
they run into Grandpa Fred.</p>
<p><strong>grandpa � ,ed</strong>: Hey, Billy – the-building’s
completely screwe p today –</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Fred. I know…</p>
<p><strong>grandpa fred</strong>: Sure. You’re young. You know
everything. Billy and Kate arrive at the newsstand, where Billy grabs
four souvenir FLASHLIGHTS in the shape of the building.</p>
<p><strong>56a.</strong>: is ?9 CONTINUED t 79</p>
<p><strong>newsstand lady</strong>: Eighty-six thirty-eight with
tax.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I’m going to go up and – Now much?</p>
<p><strong>newsstand lady</strong>: Four times nineteen ninety-five
–</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Put it on my bill.</p>
<p><strong>79 continued% 79</strong>: He hands Kate a couple of
flashlights as they start back across the lobby.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Remember, they can’t stand bright light. If
one of them gets near you – He’s interrupted as Marla comes up to them –
and gives Billy a squeeze and a kiss before he has time to think.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Good morning, Billy. That was so aim, last
night. We’re going to have to do that again –</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Uh – Marla, this is Kate, my –</p>
<p><strong>mar la</strong>: Oops, I’d better get going. See you ui
tairs, Billy.</p>
<p>****: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Uh, Kate – listen, think I better explain
–</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Don’t do any explaining right now, okay? I’m
too mad. A guide calls Kate from the guide office.</p>
<p><strong>guide</strong>: Kate – you’re up, honey.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Excuse me. I have to go to work now.</p>
<p><strong>billy i</strong>: But – look, I’m going up to Systems
Control. If I’m not back down here in fifteen minutes –</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: 0 Billy – if we all get through today alive,
you’re in h,g, trouble.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Kate – f</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Terrific. As Billy heads for the elevators,
HOLD on a nearby Miller’s Outpost jeans store that opens onto the lobby.
A couple of teenage girl SHOPPERS approach the SALES CLERK.</p>
<p><strong>shopper</strong>: Excuse me…do you have any styles that
aren’t, urn, fringed? They hold up several pairs of pants. All of them
are “fringed” from the knees down – as if they’d been CLAWED to tatters.
From the store’s back room, we HEAR a whoop. It’s familiar, but the
VOICE has become deep, raspy, and such less innocent.</p>
<p><strong>daffy</strong>: Wa- !</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Mister Forster – ��? FORSTER Zs: Peltzer!
What are you doing in this building? You got yourself arrested here last
night, and you come back? Get security up here. He’s out. He starts to
walk away, but Billy follows his.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Mister Forster, we have to evacuate the
building. Right now.</p>
<p><strong>forster</strong>: Oh, we do? Why’s that?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: There are … creatures in the building. They
start out as these small, furry animals, but then they eat, and they go
into cocoons, and then they become small, green –</p>
<p><strong>forster</strong>: This is drugs. It’s got to be. You’re on a
groovy little trio, aren’t you, Peltzer? Well, let me tell you
something, Mister Flower Child –</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Just listen to me –</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: Wait a mo. this is good. They start out
rr d then they have the cocoons… V</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: First they eat –</p>
<p><strong>technician 2</strong>: Well, sure. you’re going into a
cocoon, you want to have a little something first.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Sir – I’m sorry, but you have to keep up with
the rest of the group…</p>
<p><strong>59a.</strong>: Katsuji responds by ZOOMING in on Kate with
the video camera.</p>
<p><strong>katsuji</strong>: Excellent! Thank you! Please give me some
right profile as you continue speaking!</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Uh, If we’re very quiet, we can go in here and
watch a program being videotaped…</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Now, this week here on “Microwave With Marge”
is our special “Salute to Luncheon Meats” and I’m very , excited about t
ecipes, so let’s just jump k ome hors d’oeuvres. You kn t logna and bean
dip roll-ups-a IS when friends drop over, and f I o want to make it a
little extra special, you can get some of these little sword-shaped
toothpicks, you put that through the bologna, and that’s your “Viva
Zapata” appetizer. People are simply crazy about these…</p>
<p><strong>technician i</strong>: Okay, wait – what if one of them eats
something at eleven o’clock, but he gets something stuck in his teeth
–</p>
<p><strong>technician 2</strong>: A caraway seed.</p>
<p><strong>technician 1</strong>: Whatever, right, and then after twelve
o’clock, it comes out – now, he didn’t eat that after midnight –</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Look I didn’t make the rules. There are –</p>
<p><strong>forster</strong>: “The rules.” I can’t believe this.</p>
<p><strong>technician 2</strong>: Or what about if he’s eating in an
airplane, and they cross the time zone – But the technician’s theory is
cut short, as – – TWO GREEN ARMS BURST OUT OF HIS CONSOLE, ripping aside
control buttons and speaker grilles in a burst of SPARKS AND</p>
<p><strong>smoke.</strong>: Before the technician can move, the arms are
going for his throat – and MOHAWK, now a bloodthirsty Gremlin, emerges
from the wreckage of the console, still CHOKING the technician.</p>
<p><strong>technician 2</strong>: Help – me – At the sight of
Mohawi�rster jumps back. Technician 1 tries to move on the Gremli 34o
awk takes a claw from his victim’s neck and SLASHES a ian 1’s arm,
driving him back. Billy pulls out his building-shag plight and SHINES it
at the Gremlin. Recoiling, the Gremlin s go of the technician, who falls
to the floor – dead.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: This is how we used to cook for big groups,
before we had our microwave ovens and the other modern appliances. It
would take days to plan the menu, and hours over a hot stove to do the
cooking. But now, we can make this same tuna-noodle cheez-product
chowder surprise in just a few minutes, and you can feed anything from a
high school reunion to a complete chain gang with this kind of
quantity.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Whew! Now, if we step over here… But as she
starts to turn away, the LIGHTS on the set suddenly</p>
<p><strong>cameraman</strong>: Huh. Brownout or something. Marge HEARS a
TAPPING noise from inside the soup pot. Confused, she lifts the lid –
and JUMPS BACK, as LENNY – now a GREMLIN, but his dopey face still
recognizable – sits up in the soup pot, wearing a chef’s hat, and
SPLATTERS Marge with orange noodle-casserole GOO. He whips out a TURKEY
EASTER, and SQUIRTS Marge with it.</p>
<p><strong>aaagghhh! what is it?</strong>: At the sound of Gremli
LAUGHTER, she wheels to see GEORGE, a GREMLIN in an apron, counter
behind her. As Marge turns to the Cameraman for pr tl George points to
two MICROWAVE OVENS at the rear of the set.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Look out! – and THE OVENS EXPLODE, showering
the set with GLASS. As Marge and her cameraman escape the studio, the
ovens catch FIRE. The flames lick up toward the ceiling – – and set off
the SPRINKLERS. George and Lenny grin, standing tall to shower in the
spray. As the water hits, BUBBLES appear on the Gremlins’ backs. Close
on the bubbles, CAMERA finds the tiny heads of GREMLIN OFFSPRING,
getting ready to burst out. As the studio fills with the ominous SMOKE
and COLORED LIGHT of Gremlin multiplication, Kate runs from the
room.</p>
<p><strong>technician 1</strong>: Mister Forster, I show lighting
brownouts in five locations.</p>
<p><strong>technician 3</strong>: I’ve got a climate control
malfunction, floors fifteen and sixteen –</p>
<p><strong>forster</strong>: What the hell’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>technician 4</strong>: Uh, air – Forster goes over to
Technician 4’s station –</p>
<p><strong>technician 4</strong>: The Peat Infestation Monitor… – and
sees, on the technician’s screen, an alarmingly rapid proliferation of
DOTS, spreading over the diagram of the building. The dots started as a
cluster in the cable TV studio area – Microwave Marge’s studio – but
they’re spreading out to other floors, and moving around quickly.
FORSTER is’, What is that? That’ 01 at rats, is it?</p>
<p><strong>technici</strong>: No sir, I’m afraid s not – A VIDEOPHONE
RINGS near Technician 3; he grabs it.</p>
<p><strong>techni a►n 3</strong>: Systems Control hone SCREEN.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: 0 Is Billy Peltier there, please?</p>
<p><strong>64./64a.</strong>: 89A CONTINUEDs 89A</p>
<p><strong>technician 3</strong>: No, he said he was going to Mister
Clamp’s office – hey, do you know anything about –</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Thirty-eight. But the VOICE that croaks back
isn’t the usual elevator voice.</p>
<p><strong>thir-ty-eig</strong>: Kate’s face registers She jams on the
“DOOR OPEN” button, but the door stay And the elevator starts</p>
<p><strong>moving…</strong>: .before it jerks to a sudden STOP:</p>
<p><strong>clamp</strong>: HAve you shredded my mail from this
morning?</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: I’m just finishing, Mister Clamp.</p>
<p><strong>clamp</strong>: Good. Let’s do some memos…</p>
<p><strong>jimmy stewart</strong>: Merry Christmas, movie house! Merry
Christmas, drugstore… Scowling, Clamp pushes a button. The movie
blossoms into garish, unlifelike COLOR.</p>
<p><strong>91 tnt. clamp’s outer office 91</strong>: Clamp’s SECRETARY
pushes the last of his morning’s mail into the # SHREDDER beside her
desk – it’s a letter bearing the seal of the Vice President of the
United States and starting “Thank you # for your generous contribution…”
# As the letter turns into paper spaghetti, the secretary leaves the
shredder on, turns to her computer, and starts typing down Clamp’s
dictation. SPOT her prim pink SWEATER hanging on the back of her
chair.</p>
<p><strong>clamp</strong>: You’re not my secretary. The Gremlin responds
by grabbing a SILEX POT of boiling-hot water from the nearby coffee
station, and FLINGING the boiling water at Clamp – – who ducks it, as it
SCALDS the paint on the wall behind him. Clamp makes a tentative move
toward the Gremlin, who THROWS the empty Silex. It barely misses Clamp,
and SMASHES against the wall. The Gremlin JUMPS at Clamp, who tries to
bat it away from his face, like a kid panicked by a moth – – but his
flailing knocks the Gremlin back, so that its foot is caught in the
hopper of the secretary’s SHREDDER. Hating to do it, using only his
fingertips, Clamp PUSHES the struggling Gremlin down into the machine –
– which SPRAYS him out of the bottom like a black, bloody, eyes-only
memo of DEATU. As Clamp stands gasping ®de the machine, the door to the
corridor opens, and Billlybu in. He sees the shredder, and 0 the
tattered Gremlin remaips 4 j ng from it.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Sir – are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>clamp</strong>: I think so..-.I hate using these machines
myself.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Sir, I have to talk to you. There are a – The
door opens again, and a dishevelled Forster bursts in.</p>
<p><strong>forster</strong>: Mister Clamp, there’s a situation in – My
God, what –</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Sir, please listen to me. There are more of
these things – maybe lots more. We’ve got to get people out of the
building – and we’ve got to close the building up. We’ve got to do it
before sundown.</p>
<p><strong>clamp</strong>: Yeah? What happens at sundown?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: These – things can’t stand sunlight. It’ll
kill them. But once it’s night time, they can get out, into New York. If
that happens –</p>
<p><strong>forster</strong>: He should be in custody. He’s
dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>amp</strong>: Bangerous’ is thing that was in here a min go –
that was dangerous. is ’s from the art department. i</p>
<p><strong>forster</strong>: Yeah? Ask him how he knows so much about
these – green things.</p>
<p><strong>clamp</strong>: That’s a good question, Bill. How dQ you know
about them?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Well – um, you know that genetics laboratory,
down on –</p>
<p><strong>clamp</strong>: Of course. Those guys. I warned you that
could be a problem tenant. We could have had three shrinks and a plastic
surgeon in that space. But no…</p>
<p><strong>elevator voice</strong>: You have requested a floor that is
not part of the building at this time… And now Kate SEES CLAWS tearing
at the corners of the elevator car, trying to gouge their way inside.
The O.S. SOUND of GREMLIN LAUGHTER echoes in the elevator shaft. Kate
shrinks into the middle of the floor, her hands braced against the walls
–</p>
<p><strong>lady i</strong>: There are some nice shops here in the
building…</p>
<p>****: We’ll get the next one.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Sir, we have to make sure that none of these
– things get wet. If that happens –</p>
<p><strong>clamp</strong>: I’ll tell you what we have to do. We have to
get a lid on this thing and keep it on. No cops, no media. We’ll handle
it. Go down to systems control and get on top of this thing.</p>
<p><strong>forster</strong>: Me? Um, but there might be –</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: Not me.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: Hey! My vegetable medley! Before Wally can
stop him, a GREMLIN goes over to the potted VEGETABLE PLANTS with TUBES
connecting them to a glass vial. He grabs the vial, EATS it…and stands
still for a moment… .as his EARS turn into leafy clumps of ROMAINE
LETTUCE. Wally tries to move on him, but the Gremlin menaces his with a
claw, and goes on to grab a vial from a CAULIFLOWER PLANT… CHAOS ensues,
as more Gremlins go after more vials and the scientists’ efforts to stop
them result mainly in trashed</p>
<p><strong>equipment:</strong>: ANGLE on a Gremlin trying a vial marked
SEX HORMONE. The Gremlin’s face registers big consumer satisfaction – he
downs the rest of the vial in one gulp.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: My God! As the lab’s chief researcher stands in
the doorway, unable to</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Oh no…</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: .not the brain hormone. The Gremlin swallows
the vial…twitches for a moment. He painfully croaks out a few WORDS
–</p>
<p><strong>brain gremlin</strong>: I…want…to – Then, suddenly, the
transformation takes hold, in thrashing Jekyll-and-Hyde HISTRIONICS that
send the Gremlin rolling on the floor. When he stands, he wears a pair
of HORN-RIMMED GLASSES, and SPEAKS FLUENTLY in a new VOICE, similar to
that of</p>
<p>****: – talk a little bit about what’s going on in this room, because
I think there are some fascinating ramifications here for the future.
When you introduce genetic material of research quality to a life form
such as ours, which is possessed of a sort of – I hesitate’to use the
word “atavism,” but let us say a highly aggressive nature… The other
Gremlins, instantly bored with this guy, grab more vials and start
turning ANIMALS loose from their cages, as the scientists try in vain to
op them.</p>
<p><strong>brain` nlin</strong>: .for example, at fellow over near the,
I believ n ’ + a common bat of the order – the only mammals, I mig add,
capable of true flight… Indeed, a GREMLIN is approaching cage of the BAT
who’s being 40 desensitized to light for messenge ing purposes. The
Gremlin grabs a collecting VIAL connected by surgical tubing to the
bat’s body. The Gremlin swallows the vial, then stands watching,
surprised, as his hands become WEBBED, like bat wings. While this: is
happening, the Brain Gremlin walks over to the Bat Gremlin.</p>
<p><strong>brain gremlin</strong>: Nibs:: Brings ! Might I have a brief
word’ with you? The= t QrenLin:looks curiously at him.</p>
<p><strong>brain gremlin</strong>: My friend, you have…potential. I want
to help you be all that you can be…may I? As he continues talking, he
plucks the intravenous tube from the bat’s body, and happily JAMS the
needle into the. Bat Gremlin’s skin. The bottle with the sunshine logo
on it drains quickly…</p>
<p>****: As I’m su ou’re aware, sunlight poses a prk4Cklks for
our…ethnic group. We nit tan, we don’t burn – frankly, west become a
rather unappetizing a of photochemical leftover. Thus, is formula…specia
y designed for those of the noctu6a persuasion…to mak right light no
problem whatever. That will be of crucial usefulness where you’ll be
going…</p>
<p><strong>brain gremlin</strong>: You have wings, my friend. Flap them.
The Bat Gremlin does – and TAKES OFF, soaring near the ceiling as the
twin scientists chase. him.</p>
<p><strong>lew i s and martin</strong>: Down! Down!</p>
<p><strong>brain gremlin</strong>: To the window, my friend! A world of
possibilities opens itself to you! Throw off the old constraints… The
Bat Gremlin wings toward one of the polarized glass windows…</p>
<p><strong>brain gremlin</strong>: There it is…the Apple…the city so
nice they named it twice… check it out one time – won’t you? .and
SMASHES THROUGH IT, leaving a jagged bat silhouette in the glass behind
him. The other Gremlins shrink from the invading rays of SUNLIGHT, but
the Bat Gremlin flies free…</p>
<p><strong>110 omit 110</strong>: I 1 i OMIT</p>
<p><strong>grandpa fred</strong>: .tonight we’ve got a classic horror
movie, from Grandpa Fred’s special dungeon – Fred is interrupted by a
MOAN – not the normal weak moan on the tape, but a genuinely scary
GREMLIN moan. He turns around, and sees a grinning GREMLIN emerge from
behind the prop tombstone. As Fred heads back there, two other GREMLINS
join the first one, and the three of them watch him intently.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Fred, what’s the story with those –
things?</p>
<p><strong>grandpa fred</strong>: Uh.. .I don’t… One of the Gremlins
takes the reel of film from Fred, unreels a little from the loose end
and holds it up. A second Gremlin looks at a frame – mimes terrified
shock, then CLUTCHES his chest and falls back onto the floor. The of
e%.Gremlins LAUGH.</p>
<p><strong>no</strong>: Uh – that ’ s right, it ’ s real ’ scary – The
other two Gremlins put their f alongside Fred’s and make scary snarls.
They like it here</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Boy, that’s creepy. Okay, rolling…</p>
<p><strong>grandpa fred</strong>: Uh – Grandpa Fred and his Friends have
something horrible in store for you tonight… The Gremlins nod in gleeful
agreement.</p>

they pay little notice to the NEWSCASTER on the TV set over the bar.</p>
<p><strong>40 newscaster</strong>: .of major mechanical problems today
at the Clamp Centre office i building. Reached by Hotline News, a
spokesman for developer Daniel Clamp says there’s nothing to worry
about, that these are just the normal “glitches” that a new building
goes through in the first few months. Turning to sports…</p>
<p><strong>115 angle - salad bar 115</strong>: Salad bar CUSTOMERS are
heaping their plates.</p>
<p><strong>customer 4</strong>: My broker a ,g s the strongest things in

<p><strong>custom</strong>: Really. IRY00 1-1</p>
<p><strong>customer 4</strong>: Of course, he’s been in jail for a while
now… Customer 4 reaches under the salad bar’s sneeze-guard with the
plastic tongs to pull a clump of lettuce from the bin – and is horrified
to discover that he is holding an ALL-VEGETABLE MUTANT GREMLIN by the
ear. This horribly smiling thing has RADISHES for eyes, CORN-row hair,
CAULIFLOWER ears, STRINGBEAN lips and - - as it opens its mouth – a
darting WAX-PEPPER TONGUE. As other customers recoil, horrified,
Customer 4 tries to drop the Vege-Gremlin, but, baring its sharp
ARTICHOKE TEETH, it reaches out with CARROT fingers to grab his shirt
and pull his THROUGH the sneeze guard.</p>
<p><strong>116aa</strong>: In a Clamp Cable TV studio, LEONARD MALTIN is
taping an “At the Movies”-type show called “THE MOVIE POLICE.”</p>
<p><strong>leonard maltin</strong>: And now for our videocassette
consumer watch – He gingerly holds up a videocassette of the first
Gr,gmlins movie as if it is a long-dead fish.</p>
<p><strong>leonard maltin</strong>: Here’s one that’s just been re-
released on video, and if you’re thinking of renting it, I can think of
a lot of better things to do with three dollars… Leonard is unaware of
the REAL GREMLINS that have snuck into the studio and are creeping up on
him from behind —</p>
<p><strong>leonard maltin 1 cont.1</strong>: .such as burning them. In
fact, burning this movie wouldn’t be a bad – The Gremlins ATTACK,
savagely clawing at Leonard, who quickly goes down out of view – except
for his flailing hands.</p>

’Bye. - The Gremlin points an accusing claw at the broker.</p>
<p><strong>gremlin</strong>: Nice tie! The broker starts yanking the tie
off, but the Gremlin SWIPES at him, and he beats it, as WIDER ANGLE
REVEALS a number of OTHER GREMLINS also chasing brokers off, and
grabbing their phones –</p>
<p><strong>gremlins</strong>: Buy! Sell! Sell! Buy! Sell! SPOT the Brain
Hormone Gremlin, kicked back in a broker’s chair, talking on a
phone.</p>
<p><strong>brain gremlin</strong>: .yes, I’d say it’s a full-scale
panic. Are you having a run on the banks there yet? Well, it’s rather
brutal here …we’re advising our clients to put everything they’ve got

age- old drama of self- preservation…</p>
<p><strong>worker 2</strong>: Fire! Fire! PEOPLE from offices’start
beating it toward the stairwell exit.</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: Oh, Murray – what a beautiful building!</p>
<p><strong>mr. futterman</strong>: Beautiful? Looks like somethin’ out
of the dark ages. True, Saint Eva Marie’s architecture is on the vy side
…as CAMERA notices the ornate windows and the cor ‘te topped with spooky
stone GARGOYLES – Wait a minute. That one there…that’s �’ a`rgoyle…</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: What is it, Murray? It’s the FLYING
BAT-GREMLIN – and it leaves its perch to fly</p>
<p><strong>mr. futterman</strong>: Hey’. Help! He flails at the Gremlin,
batting it away from him, but it keeps coming back – as Sheila stands
back, too terrified to move –</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: Murray, what is it?</p>
<p><strong>mr. futterman</strong>: It’s them! Help me! Somebody help me!
But the NEW YORKERS on the sidewalk continue past him, oblivious.

Greml trying to get hold of Its slashing claws. His face is CUT – and
his wrist –. wt he grabs hold of one claw, then the other, and manages
to FLING the struggling Gremlin away from him, so that it tumbles, off
balance, into the constr ion crew’s churning CEMENT MIXER – tng Gremlin
emerges from the cement mixer’s thick whirlpool, coated with ray cement.
Murray braces for another attack – but the cement weighs th emlin down
so much that all it can do is flap its wings slowly, lofting pa ully
toward the cathedral, as the cement starts HARDENING – – and as the
Gremlin regains his perch, the cement solidifies, so that he is now a
Gargoyle for real – and for good. Mr. Futterman catches his breath -and
takes off running.</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: Murray – where are you going?</p>

swilling whiskey, he gulps from the vial he stole in the genetics lab,
the one with the spider logo on it. The blade moves closer-grazing
Gizmo’s fur…but as it SLICES the topmost fibers of the twine that holds
him down – – a CHANGE comes over Gizmo’s expression. This is one Mogwai
who’s had enough. He sets his jaw in angry determination, and BURSTS the
frayed twine, freeing one arm – then another – George grabs the T-square
like a scythe, and tries to hack at Gizmo with the knife blade – – but
Gizmo GRABS the pendulum and PULLS down hard, so that George TUMBLES
from his shelf –</p>

they SEE a TV NEWSPERSON interviewing the nearly hysterical Microwave
Marge beside the door.</p>

VIDEO-PHONE end steps between Clamp and the Electric Gremlin. At the
last possible instant, he holds the receiver up in the Electric
Gremlin’s path. The glowing beast touches the mouthpiece… .DISAPPEARS

trapped, writhing in pain, as RECORDED VOICES bounce around it and issue
from the phone’s SPEAKER.</p>

rendition of “Raindrops Keep Wallin’ on My Head.” The Electric Gremlin
WRITHES more fiercely, his pain doubled.</p>
<p><strong>clamp</strong>: Uh, Bill – thanks.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Sure. Mister Clamp, we have to stop these
things from leaving the building. If they get out, that’s it for New
York – at least New York. Clamp nods gravely, and takes a VIDEOCASSETTE
from a drawer.</p>

maybe it will.</p>

<p><strong>clamp</strong>: The sign-off. The b sign-off</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Because of the end of civilization, the
Clamp Cable Network now leaves the air. We hope you have enjoyed our

of an old hymn:</p>

<p><strong>billy</strong>: Sunlight kills these things. That’s why
they’re still in here. But when it’s sundown – or when they think it is
– they’ll all get together in one place, so they can go out. They’ll all
be in the lobby.</p>

it you want? The Brain Gremlin answers in his usual cultured tones,
sounding lucid.</p>
<p><strong>brain gremlin</strong>: Fred, what we want is, I think, what
everyone wants, and what you and your viewers have – civilization,</p>
<p><strong>brain gremlin</strong>: The niceties, Fred. The fine points.
Diplomacy. Compassion. Standards, manners, tradition. That’s what we’re
reaching toward. Oh, we may stumble along the way, but – civilization,
yes. The Geneva Convention. Chamber music. Susan Sontag. Everything your
society has worked so hard to accomplish over the centuiries – that’s
what we aspire to. We want to be civilized. I mean, you take a look at
this fellow here… On TV, a DOPEY-LOOKING GREMLIN wanders into FRAME,
grinning stupidly, waving at Fred’s O.S. CAMERA. The Brain Gremlin
reaches out of FRAME, comes back with a GUN, and SHOOTS the dopey
Gremlin. The bar Gremlins love it.</p>
<p><strong>brain gremlin</strong>: Now, was that civilized? No. Clearly
not. i Fun, but in no sense civilized… On TV, Fred starts backing
nervously away from the armed Gremlin.</p>

dark. We’ve put all the clocks in the building ahead three hours. When
they think it’s sunset…and they see what a nice “night” it is outside…
they’ll all be in the lobby, getting ready to come out. When they do, we
drop this backdrop …and let the sunlight fry ’em.</p>

<p><strong>marla</strong>: Okay. Wait. I’m going to be honest with you.
It’ll be a cathartic openness thing. It wasn’t business. I tried to get
something going with him. But I couldn’t get to first base. Does that
help?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: It’ll do. She reaches into her purse, and
pulls out a Swiss Army KNIFE. But as she starts cutting Marla down,
Marla SEES something else, and SCREAMS –</p>
<p><strong>00 5l</strong>: They HEAR Kate’s SCREAM O.S., an in the
direction it came from. 615h</p>
<p><strong>40 55 continuedt 155</strong>: Gizmo SEES his enemy menacing
Kate and Marla. Grim determination shows on his face, as he HEARS in his
mind:</p>
<p><strong>sylvester stallone</strong>: To survive a war, you’ve got to
become war. Holding the drawn bow and arrow in front of him, he PIVOTS
on the display case, so that the match SCRATCHES against the wall, and
CATCHES FIRE – – and, as Billy and Mr. Futterman round the corner, they
SEE Gizmo loose the arrow – – which catches Spider-Mohawk in mid-body.
The FLAMES spread over his body and to his hairy legs as he writhes,
tumbles over, and DIES. Billy rushes to cut the women free with a pocket
knife, as Mr. Futterman looks at Gizmo, up on the display case.</p>
<p><strong>mr. futterman</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: 0 That’s Gizmo, Mister Fu tprtt He’s on our
side. Mr. Futterman gives Gizmo a hand down from the display case.</p>
<p><strong>mr. futterman</strong>: Uh…thanks. Gizmo responds with a
quick, Stallone-style nod, as Kate and Billy embrace.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Billy – What happened to him?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I guess they – pushed him too far.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Thank God you’re okay.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I am now.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Well – Gizmo got wet, and then the Mogwais
ate after midnight, and then some of the Gremlins must have mutated,
from the genetic material.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: And if these things get out of here now –</p>
<p><strong>mr. futterman</strong>: We’ll stop ’em, Billy. I’ll tell you
something – ever since these guys attacked us, back in Kingston Fails,
I’ve been scared it would happen again. But now that it happened…I’m_not
seared.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: How come?</p>
<p>****: Screwy, huh? But you know, Billy – the most important part of
“American” is those last four letters: “I Can.” Washington didn’t give
up…Lincoln didn’t give up –</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Please –</p>
<p><strong>mr. futterman</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I’m sorry, it’s – Lincoln’s birthday.
Something terrible happened on Lincoln’s birthday one year, and ever
since then…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I don’t think we have tli�e Kate. Let’s no.
`�,�</p>
<p><strong>brain gremlin</strong>: Is everybody here? A CHEER of assent
from the Gremlins.</p>
<p><strong>brain gremlin</strong>: All right then… The Brain Gremlin
holds a SPORTSCOAT over one shoulder, Frank Sinatra–style. As he nears
the doors, he starts SINGING “New York, New York,” with the GREMLINS
SINGING the backup horn part behind him„</p>
<p><strong>brain gremlin gremlins</strong>: Start spreading the news,
Dat dat da-da-dat, I’m leaving today… Dat dat da-da-dat, I want to be a
part of it, Dat dat da-da-dat, New York, New York… Dat dat da-da-dat… As
the Gremlins swing into their SONG, an ANGLE on the lobby floor spots
two TRASH CANS with swinging lids. Grandpa Fred peeks cautiously out of
one, while Kstsuji aims his camera out of the other. They’re covering
the Gremlins from cover, like Edward R. Murrow broadcasting from a
bunker.</p>
<p><strong>grandpa fred</strong>: …it seems incredible, but following
their bl _urdijnif rampage a destruction, these creatures are now
mounting what appears to be a production number…</p>
<p><strong>157 angle - mezzanine 157</strong>: Billy, Kate, Marla, Gizmo
and Mr. Futterman arrive on the mezzanine. They look over the railing,
at the Gremlin assembly below.</p>
<p><strong>mr. futterman</strong>: Hey, these guys aren’t bad –</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Billy, they’re going to the doors… Billy
points at the dark-glass WINDOWS over the lobby.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Don’t worry. In a few seconds, Mister Clamp’s
going to drop that cloth out there. The sunlight will come in, and –</p>
<p><strong>kate ‘4’°0</strong>: Sunlight? On the: unwelcome SOUND of a`
THUNDERCLAP,</p>
<p><strong>brain gremlin gremlins</strong>: I want to wake up Dat dat da
da da In the city that never sleeps… Dat dat da da da… Some Gremlins
have formed a Rockettes-style KICK LINE, while others load cameras and
flip through guidebooks such as “Dining After Midnight in New York.”</p>
<p><strong>160 angle - mezzanine 160</strong>: Billy and the others
watch.</p>
<p><strong>mr. futterman</strong>: If those guys get out there in the
rain – this town’s going under for the third time.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Billy, we’ve got to do something.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I know – 0065</p>
<p><strong>m 0 n</strong>: He points to a coiled canvas FIRE HOSE in a
case on the wall nearby.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Mr. Futterman. Get that hose. Aim it into the
lobby.</p>
<p><strong>mr. futterman</strong>: Into the lobby? Are you nuts?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Just do it. Do it fast…Kate, get a box, and
put Gizmo in it…keep him dry… Down in the lobby, the happy Gremlins keep
moving toward the doors…</p>
<p><strong>brain gremlin gremlins</strong>: These little-town blues Dat
dat da da dat, Are melting away Dat dat da da dat, I’ll make a brand new
start of it Dat dat da da dat, In old New York… Dat dat da da dat…</p>
<p><strong>160 continued: 160</strong>: E .while, on the mezzanine, Kate
grabs a box from a nearby store, and Mr. Futterman hauls out the hose.
Billy drags a video-phone extension out of a mezzanine office and brings
it to Kate -</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Kate, there’s a call on hold in Mister
Clamp’s office. Can you transfer it down here without going up
there?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Oh God – I think so –</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Hurry. Kate hurriedly hands Marla the box
containing Gizmo.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Here – Atpn’t let him get wet. Does it bit
From the box, Gizmo TWITTEje&amp;entfully.</p>
<p><strong>161 angle 161</strong>: A knot of Gremlins in the lobby SPOT
our group on the mezzanine, and start CLIMBING a modernistic SCULPTURE
to get at them…</p>
<p><strong>162 angle 162</strong>: Billy runs to turn on the hose…</p>
<p><strong>163 angle 163</strong>: The Brain Gremlin reaches for the
door…</p>
<p><strong>brain gremlin</strong>: It’s up to you, New York, New – .but
before he can open it, WATER splashes onto the lobby’s doors, its
windows, its floor… .and the Gremlins, delighted, turn to catch the
spray. Their SKIN starts to BUBBLE. CAMERA finds miniature GREMLINS in
the bubbles, as the lobby fills with the rising SMOKE AND LIGHT of
Gremlin replication…</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: On the mezzanine, Marla keeps Gizmo shielded in
the box as Mr. Futterman uses the gushing hose to knock the climbing
Gremlins off the sculpture, then turns it on the lobby floor again.
Billy stands beside Kate, who furiously punches at the video- phone’s
keypad –</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: .tap into the PBX. .back through the voice
mail module …main switchboard… into the Ethernet… five-digit code –</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: That’s it’. On the screen of the video-phone,
the ELECTRIC GREMLIN writhes in agony, trying to gel off Hold, as the
plastic button BLINKS beneath the screen. Billy grabs the phone fr d
Kew,. lifts the receiver and holds it out over the mezzanine rani He
looks down at the happily showering Gremlins – – PUSHES the blinking
button dow – and sees the Electric Gremlin SHOOT OUT OF THE RECEIVER,
swooping down into the lobby –</p>
<p><strong>screams…</strong>: .as the threatened invasion of all New
York becomes a sodden, viscous puddle of green, churning protoplasm that
swamps the lobby… .and our heroes sigh with relief, their bodies
untensing…</p>
<p><strong>164a angle - lobby floor 164a</strong>: .as the lobby doors b
open, and Clamp comes in, leading a SWAT team in full comba , in what he
expects to be a last- ditch charge – – and finding nothing but a s green
goo on the lobby floor. He waves the SWAT team t st p.</p>
<p><strong>clamp</strong>: It’s okay, guys. Maybe we can use this stuff
as land fill… Grandpa Fred and Katsuji rush over to Clamp.</p>
<p><strong>grandpa fred</strong>: We’re here exclusively with – Clamp
waves Fred and Katsuji to a stop. Fred lowers the mike.</p>
<p><strong>clamp</strong>: Excuse me there, pal. Who told you to go on
my network with all that coverage today?</p>
<p><strong>grandpa fred</strong>: Um – nobody, sir. It just – seemed
like news, and I.,.</p>
<p><strong>clamp</strong>: Right. I’m making you an anchor. Six o’clock
weeknights.</p>
<p><strong>grandpa fred</strong>: You’re making me – ?</p>
<p><strong>clamp</strong>: I want you to go down to Barney’s and see
about some different clothes, though. This –</p>
<p>****: This says to me, “Old World.” Think about sweaters. Think
avuncular.</p>
<p><strong>grandpa fred</strong>: Uh – right.</p>
<p><strong>katsuji</strong>: Congrats° He turns his camera on Fred, and
they start backing out of the building.</p>
<p><strong>grandpa fred</strong>: What does a men’s wear makeover cost
in Manhattan today? Join us, as we iny,estigate… 0 Billy and the
othefs’c � off the stairs from the mezzanine, and go over to join Clamp.
,</p>
<p><strong>clamp</strong>: Bill, it looks like yob ,fled us out
here…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: It wasn’t just me, sir. Everybody helped.
Marla here, and – Clamp looks at Marla.</p>
<p><strong>clamp</strong>: Marla. You work for me, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Yes, sir. Very, very hard. Clamp nods, looks
at her – as if for the first time. Something promising passes between
them… .as the doors to the building open, admitting Sheila Futterman and
a small crowd of REPORTERS. Sheila sloshes hurriedly through the goo to
Murray’s side.</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: Murray – what happened?</p>
<p><strong>mr. futterman</strong>: They tried it again, Sheila. But we
were ready for ’em. We’re going home, guys. See you… The Futtermans
exchange goodbye WAVES with Billy and Kate, and leave. The reporters
latch onto Marla…</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: What happened here?</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Oh, it was a complete nightmare disaster. We
had to stop work completely… .as Billy and Kate commisserate with
Clamp.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I’m sorry about the building, sir.</p>
<p><strong>clamp</strong>: I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>kate mun</strong>: You’re not?</p>
<p><strong>clamp</strong>: For one thing, we’re insured for the damage.
For another…maybe it wasn’t for people anyway. It was a place for
things. You make a place for things…</p>
<p>****: .things come.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Well, you kept the city safe.</p>
<p><strong>clamp</strong>: That’s right. That’s a good point. The
sacrifice…you know, this could be good in my next book. I should be
taking notes. You have any paper?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Let me see… Re rummages – comes up with paper
and pencil from his pockets and hands them to Clamp. But as Clamp
unfolds the paper –</p>
<p><strong>clamp</strong>: Wait a minute – what’s this?</p>
<p><strong>48 164a continued: 164a</strong>: It’s Billy’s drawing of the
main street of Kingston Falls.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: That’s Kingston Falls.</p>
<p><strong>clamp</strong>: This is what I’m looking for.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: You want to move there?</p>
<p><strong>clamp</strong>: I want to bu it. My new project, over in
Jersey – this is terrific! This is what people want now – the
traditional community thing. Quiet little towns! Back to the earth – Is
this your concept?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: It’s our home town.</p>
<p><strong>clamp</strong>: That’s even better! I love M1Q ! F M 00065
It’s – wait – Clamp Corners! “Where life slows down to a crawl.” What do
you think?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Uh, that’s –</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: It’s terrific.</p>
<p><strong>clamp</strong>: This is the kind of thing people need. Not
talking elevators, just – Bill, you sell me this design, and we’ll build
the biggest, most sensational quiet little town you’ve ever seen.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Of course, for Billy to do a whole</p>
<p><strong>clamp</strong>: We can come to a deal. Believe me. Are you
Mrs. Peltzer?</p>
<p>****: I’m going to be, Yeah. Billy squeezes Kate tighter, with Gizmo
cuddled between them. The door to the building opens again – and Billy’s
father, the inventor RAND PELTZER, comes in.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Dad!</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Billy.. ,Kate. He slogs over to Billy, Kate,
and Clamp.</p>
<p><strong>bil</strong>: Uh, Mister Cl this is my dad –</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Rand Peltzer’s the me, sir. Inventor. Solving
tge y’s problems with tomorrow’s techn ] gy. Here’s my card.</p>
<p><strong>clamp</strong>: A pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: I saw on TV what was happening…’ thought I’d
come help you guys out. He takes out an AEROSOL CAN.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Wish I’d finished this stuff a little
sooner.</p>
<p><strong>clamp</strong>: What is it? Rand indicates Gizmo, who’s being
held by Billy.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: The Peltzer overcoat. in a Can. Personal
waterproofing, for those who can not afford wetness. May I demonstrate?
Gizmo looks at Rand, and nods somberly, Stallone-style. Billy holds him
up, and Rand SPRAYS the chemical over his body.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Boy, if I’d have finished this stuff a few
days sooner, we could have saved everyone a lot of trouble. Kills you
when that happens… He finishes spraying – and takes out a WATER
PISTOL.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Observe. Everyone tenses as Rand aims the
squirtgun at Gizmo –</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Dad – o – but the splash f ater hits Gizmo
with no effect, and everyone – includ i the stolid Mogwai – relaxes.</p>
<p><strong>spray-c</strong>: Excuse me – d e that stuff work</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Sir, this’ll work r k on just about
anything.</p>
<p><strong>clamp</strong>: How about construction crews?</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: No reason why not.</p>
<p><strong>clamp</strong>: Excuse us a minute.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: I’ll call you guys – Clamp leads Rand away,
talking business…</p>
<p><strong>clamp</strong>: I f you knew what I was spending on tarps
alone…</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Is that right?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: You understand him? Billy, surprised, realizes
that he does.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Yeah…I guess I do, now.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Well, what did he say?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: He said he wants to go home.</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: Where’s home?’’’ Gizmo twitters again.</p>
<p><strong>2 c</strong>: Kate, liking the sound of i smiles. Billy pulls
her close to him, and, carrying Gizmo, t go outside…</p>
