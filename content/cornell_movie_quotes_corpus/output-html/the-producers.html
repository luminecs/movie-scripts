Abduction and cruel rape of Lucretia … And I’ll play Lucretia.</p>
<p><strong>cut to bloom in shadows. it is all too much for him.
he</strong>: LOOKS THE OTHER WAY. SUDDENLY HIS EYES WIDEN IN SURPRISE,
AS HE DISCOVERS ANOTHER MAN HIDING IN THE NEXT DOORWAY. THE MAN PUTS A
FINGER TO HIS LIPS INDICATING SILENCE. THERE IS NO PLACE LEFT FOR BLOOM
TO LOOK. HE LOOKS TO HEAVEN.</p>
<p><strong>little old lady</strong>: Oh, Thursday. Will Thursday ever

<p><strong>little old lady</strong>: Yes???</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Oh, Angelcake, you forgot to give me the
check. Can’t produce a play without money, ha, ha, ha.</p>
<p><strong>cut to bloom. once more he steals a glance at the
stranger</strong>: HIDDEN IN THE SECOND DOORWAY. ONCE AGAIN THE MAN
GESTURES FOR HIM TO BE SILENT.</p>
<p><strong>little old lady</strong>: Of course, the check, I had it with
me all the time.</p>
<p><strong>little old lady</strong>: I don’t know what’s happening to
me. I must be getting old.</p>
<p><strong>little old lady</strong>: Is it all right? I made it out to
cash. You didn’t tell me the name of the play.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Oh, it’s fine. Fine. Good. Good. Bye.
Bye.</p>
<p><strong>little old lady</strong>: Til Thursday, my Darling, I shall
count the minutes.</p>
<p><strong>little old lady</strong>: Ta. Ta.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Ta. Ta.</p>
<p><strong>the man, who has been lurking in the second doorway,
suddenly</strong>: SPRINGS INTO ACTION. HE DARTS FORWARD AND QUICKLY
TAKES THE CHECK OUT OF BIALYSTOCK’S HAND.</p>
<p><strong>the man</strong>: He who signs a lease, must pay rent.</p>
<p><strong>he shoves the check into his pocket and starts down
the</strong>: STAIRS.</p>
<p><strong>landlord</strong>: That’s the law.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Murderer! Thief! How can you take the
last penny out of a man’s pocket?</p>
<p><strong>landlord</strong>: I have to … I’m a landlord!</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Oh Lord, hear my plea. Destroy him. He
maketh a blight on the land.</p>
<p><strong>landlord</strong>: Don’t pay attention. He’s crazy.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Nnnnn. That hurt. I’ll have to make
another call.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Have you been there all this time?</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: And did you see and hear everything?</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Then what do you have to say for
yourself?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Uh … uh … ooooooops?</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Who are you? What do you want? Why are
you loitering in my hallway? Speak, dummy, speak! Why don’t you
speak?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Scared. Can’t talk.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: All right. Get a hold of yourself. Take
a deep breath, let it out slowly and tell me who you are.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: I’m Leo Bloom, I’m an accountant, I’m from
Whitehall and Marks, I was sent here to do your books and I’m terribly
sorry I caught you with the old lady.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: “Caught you with the old lady.” Come in,
Mr. Tact.</p>
<p><strong>cut to office. they enter. bloom enters timorously.
he</strong>: DOESN’T KNOW QUITE WHERE TO GO. HE LOOKS TO BIALYSTOCK FOR
GUIDANCE. BIALYSTOCK STUDIES BLOOM CURIOUSLY FROM HEAD TO TOE.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: So you’re an accountant, eh?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Then account for yourself! Do you
believe in God? Do you believe in gold? Why are you looking up old
lady’s dresses? Bit of a pervert, eh?</p>
<p><strong>bloom, who has been quaking under the assault, reaches
into</strong>: HIS POCKET AND TAKES OUT THE TATTERED CORNER OF AN OLD
BLUE BABY BLANKET. HE TWISTS THE BLUE BLANKET NERVOUSLY IN HIS
HANDS.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Sir, I …</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Never mind. Never mind. Do the books.
They’re in that desk over there. Top drawer.</p>
<p><strong>bloom dutifully goes to desk. opens top drawer and
begins</strong>: REMOVING BOOKS.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: How dare you condemn me without knowing
all the facts.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: But sir, I’m not condem …</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Shut up. I’m having a rhetorical
conversation. How humiliating. Max Bialystock. Max Bialystock.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: You know who I used to be? Max
Bialystock! The King of Broadway! Six shows running at once. Lunch at
Delmonico’s. Two hundred dollar suits. Look at me. Look at me now! I’m
wearing a cardboard belt!</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: I used to have thousands of investors
begging, pleading, to put their money into a Max Bialystock
production.</p>
<p><strong>he picks up the picture on desk (‘hold me, touch me’)
takes</strong>: IT OVER TO OPEN CABINET FILLED WITH SIMILAR
PICTURES.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Look at my investors now. Voila!
Hundreds of little old ladies stopping off at Max Bialystock’s office to
grab a last thrill on the way to the cemetery.</p>
<p><strong>cut to bloom. he is obviously touched by the great
man’s</strong>: DILEMMA.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: You have exactly ten seconds to change
that disgusting look of pity into one of enormous respect. One … Two
…</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Do the books! Do the books!</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Yes, sir. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Window’s so filthy, can’t tell if it’s
day or night out there.</p>
<p><strong>he wipes window with his cuff. looks at window. no
good.</strong>: LOOKS AT HIS GRIMY CUFF. GRIMACES. FROM HIS DESK HE
TAKES THE REMAINS OF A CARDBOARD CONTAINER OF COFFEE AND SLOSHES IT
AGAINST THE WINDOW. HE WIPES WITH HIS TIE. HE LOOKS OVER HIS SHOULDER AT
BLOOM TO SEE IF HE IS WATCHING. BLOOM IS WATCHING. THEIR EYES MEET.
BLOOM’S EYES RETREAT. BIALYSTOCK VICTORIOUSLY TURNS AWAY AND LOOKS OUT
THE WINDOW DOWN INTO THE STREET.</p>
<p><strong>camera</strong>: SHOT OF STREET. BIALYSTOCK’S POINT OF VIEW.
A:WHITE ROLLS ROYCE SLOWLY MAKES ITS WAY UP THE BLOCK.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Look at that. A white Rolls Royce.
That’s it baby, when you got it, flaunt it.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Koff, koff … ahem, ahem … harrumph …</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: I assume you are making those cartoon
noises to attract my attention. Am I correct in my assumption, you
fish-faced enemy of the people?</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: I have hurt your feelings.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Good, what is it?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Sir, may I speak to you for a minute?</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Go! You have fifty-eight seconds.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Well, sir, it seems …</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: You have forty-eight seconds left.
Hurry. Hurry.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: In looking at your books, I’ve discovered
that …</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Twenty-eight seconds, hurry, hurry,
you’re using up your time.</p>
<p><strong>in his anxiety, bloom unconsciously reaches into his
pocket</strong>: TAKES OUT THE OLD BLUE BLANKET AND NERVOUSLY STROKES
HIS CHEEK WITH IT.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Mr. Bialystock, I cannot function under these
conditions.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: You’re making me extremely nervous.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: What is that? A handkerchief?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: It’s nothing … nothing.</p>
<p><strong>quick as a flash, bialystock reaches over and snatches
it</strong>: OUT OF BLOOM’S HAND.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: If it’s nothing, why can’t I see it?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: My blanket. Give me my blue blanket.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock, taken aback, hurriedly gives the blanket back
to</strong>: BLOOM.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Here, don’t panic.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: I’m sorry … I don’t like people touching my
blue blanket. It’s not important. It’s a minor compulsion. I can deal
with it if I want to. It’s just that I’ve had it ever since I was a baby
and … and … I find it very comforting.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: They come here. They all come here. How
do they find me?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Mr. Bialystock …</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Yes, Prince Mishkin, what can we do for
you?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: This is hardly a time for levity. I’ve
discovered a serious error here in the accounts of your last play.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Where? What?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: According to the backer’s list you raised
$60,000. But the show you produced only cost fifty-eight thousand.
There’s two thousand dollars unaccounted for.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: I went to a Turkish bath, who cares? The
show was a flop. What difference does it make?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: It makes a great deal of difference. That’s
fraud. If they found out, you could go to prison.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Why should they find out? It’s only two
thousand dollars, Bloom, do me a favor, move a few decimal points
around. You can do it. You’re an accountant. The word ‘count’ is part of
your title.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: But that’s cheating!</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: It’s not cheating … It’s charity. Bloom,
look at me … look at me! I’m drowning. Other men sail through life.
Bialystock has struck a reef. Bloom, I’m going under. I am being sunk by
a society that demands success, when all I can offer is failure. Bloom,
I’m reaching out to you. Don’t send me to jail. Help! Help!</p>
<p><strong>during bialystock’s last speech, bloom unconsciously
reaches</strong>: INTO HIS POCKET, TAKES OUT THE BLUE BLANKET AND RUBS
IT ACROSS HIS CHEEK.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Help!</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: All right. I’ll do it. I’ll do it.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Thank you, Bloom. I knew I could con
you.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Oh, it’s all right … wha?</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Nothing. Nothing. Do it. Do it.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Now let’s see, two thousand dollars. That
isn’t much. I’m sure I can hide it somewhere. After all, the department
of internal revenue isn’t interested in a show that flopped.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Yes. Right. Good thinking. You figure it
out. I’m tired. I’m gonna take a little nap. Wake me if there’s a
fire.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Now let’s see, if we add these figures, we
get …</p>
<p><strong>camera moves into close-up of bloom’s finger swiftly
moving</strong>: DOWN LONG COLUMN OF FIGURES. HE COMES TO THE END AND
IMMEDIATELY WRITHES TOTAL BELOW.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Heh, heh, heh, amazing. It’s absolutely
amazing. But under the right circumstances, a producer could make more
money with a flop than he could with a hit.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Yes. Yes. It’s quite possible. If he were
certain the show would fail, a man could make a fortune.</p>
<p><strong>cut to bialystock. by now he is halfway across the
room.</strong>: HIS WHOLE BEING TINGLING WITH ALERTNESS. HE MOVES TO
BLOOM’S DESK AND HOVERS OVER HIM, WAITING EXPECTANTLY FOR MORE
INFORMATION. BUT BLOOM IS LOST IN HIS WORK, UNAWARE THAT BIALYSTOCK IS
HANGING ON HIS EVERY WORD.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Yes???</p>
<p><strong>bloom looks up. he is startled to see bialystock’s face
so</strong>: CLOSE TO HIS OWN.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Yes, what?</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: What you were saying. Keep talking.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: What was I saying?</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: You were saying that under the right
circumstances, a producer could make more money with a flop than he
could with a hit.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Yes, it’s quite possible.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: You keep saying that, but you don’t tell
me how. How could a producer make more money with a flop than with a
hit?</p>
<p><strong>bloom, slightly exasperated, puts his pencil down and
faces</strong>: BIALYSTOCK. HE SPEAKS TO BIALYSTOCK AS A TEACHER WOULD A
STUDENT.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: It’s simply a matter of creative accounting.
Let us assume, just for the moment, that you are a dishonest man.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Assume away!</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Well, it’s very easy. You simply raise more
money than you really need.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: You’ve done it yourself, only you did it on a
very small scale.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: What did I do?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: You raised two thousand more than you needed
to produce your last play.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: So what? What did it get me? I’m wearing
a cardboard belt.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Ahhhhhh! But that’s where you made your
error. You didn’t go all the way. You see, if you were really a bold
criminal, you could have raised a million.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: But the play only cost $60,000 to
produce.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Exactly. And how long did it run?</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: One night.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: See? You could have raised a million dollars,
put on a sixty thousand dollar flop and kept the rest.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: But what if the play was a hit?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Oh, you’d go to jail. If the play were a hit,
you’d have to pay off the backers, and with so many backers there could
never be enough profits to go around, get it?</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Aha, aha, aha, aha, aha, aha!! So, in
order for the scheme to work, we’d have to find a sure fire flop.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: What scheme?</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: What scheme? Your scheme, you bloody
little genius.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Oh, no. No. No. I meant no scheme. I merely
posed a little, academic accounting theory. It’s just a thought.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Bloom, worlds are turned on such
thoughts!</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Don’t you see, Bloom. Darling, Bloom,
glorious Bloom, it’s so simple. Step one: We find the worst play in the
world – a sure flop. Step two: I raise a million dollars – there’s a lot
of little old ladies in this world. Step three: You go back to work on
the books. Phoney lists of backers – one for the government, one for us.
You can do it, Bloom, you’re a wizard.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Step four: We open on Broadway and
before you can say ‘step five’ we close on Broadway. Step six: We take
our million dollars and fly to Rio de Janiero.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock grabs bloom in his arms and begins to lead him
in</strong>: A WILD TANGO AROUND THE ROOM.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: “Ah, Rio, Rio by the seao, meo, myo, meo
…”</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Mr. Bialystock. No. Wait. Please. You’re
holding me too tight. I’m an honest man. You don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: No, Bloom, you don’t understand. This is
fate, this is destiny. There’s no avoiding it.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Mr. Bialystock, not more than five minutes
ago, against my better judgment, I doctored your books. That, sir, is
the ultimate extent of my criminal life.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock raises his fists to the heavens in
despair.</strong>: BLOOM, EXPERIENCING A DEFINITE LACK OF SUPPORT, GOES
CRASHING TO THE FLOOR.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: OOOOOHH! OOOOOHH! OOOOOHH! OOOOOHH! I
WANT THAT MONEY!</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Oh, I fell on my keys. I’ve got to get out of
here.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: You miserable, cowardly, wretched little
caterpillar. Don’t you ever want to become a butterfly? Don’t you want
to spread your wings and flap your way to glory?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: You’re going to jump on me.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: You’re going to jump on me. I know you’re
going to jump on me – like Nero jumped on Poppea.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: What???</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Poppea. She was his wife. And she was
unfaithful to him. So he got mad and he jumped on her. Up and down, up
and down, until he squashed her like a bug. Please don’t jump on me.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: I’m not going to jump on you!</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Aaaaaaaaaa!</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Will you get a hold on yourself.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Don’t touch me! Don’t touch me!</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: What are you afraid of? I’m not going to
hurt you! What’s the matter with you?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: I’m hysterical. I’m having hysterics. I’m
hysterical. I can’t stop. When I get like this, I can’t stop. I’m
hysterical.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock rushes to the desk. picks up a carafe of
water</strong>: AND SHOSHES ITS CONTENTS INTO BLOOM’S FACE.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: I’m wet! I’m wet! I’m hysterical and I’m
wet!</p>
<p><strong>bialystock in a desperate move to stop bloom’s
hysterics,</strong>: SLAPS HIM ACROSS THE FACE.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: I’m in pain! And I’m wet! And I’m still
hysterical!</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: No! No! Don’t hit. It doesn’t help. It only
increases my sense of danger.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: What can I do? What can I do? You’re
getting me hysterical.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Go away from me. You frighten me. Sit over
there.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Okay. I’m way over here. Is that
better?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: It’s a little better, but you still look
angry.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: How’s this?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Good. Good. That’s nice. That’s very nice. I
think I’m coming out of it now. Yes. Yes. I’m definitely coming out of
it. Thank you for smiling. It helped a great deal.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Well, you know what they say, “Smile and
the world smiles with you.” Heh, heh. The man should be in a straight
jacket. Feeling better?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Much, thank you. But I am a little
lightheaded. Maybe I should eat something. Hysterics have a way of
severely depleting one’s blood sugar, you know.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: They certainly do. They certainly do.
Come, let me take you to lunch.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: That’s very kind of you, Mr. Bialystock, but
I …</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Nonsense, nonsense, my dear boy. I
lowered your blood sugar, but least I could do is raise it a little.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: And I promise you faithfully, I won’t
discuss that silly scheme to make a million dollars anymore.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock dons his cape and “belasco” hat. from a rack
he</strong>: SELECTS A GOLD-TOPPED WALKING STICK. HE GOES TO DOOR, OPENS
IT, AND WITH A GRAND FLOURISH, MOTIONS BLOOM TO PRECEDE HIM.</p>

BIALYSTOCK REACHES INTO HIS POCKET AND COUNTS HIS MONEY. HE LOOKS
WORRIED. SUDDENLY HIS FACE BRIGHTENS.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock drops a step behind, quickly takes off his

<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Murray, I’m going to lunch. I took two
dollars.</p>

eighty you owe me.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: I know. Don’t worry. You’ll get it.
You’ll get it.</p>
<p><strong>murray the blindman</strong>: Well, don’t forget about it. I
need it. Nobody understands. I’m competing with giants. The Greater New
York Fund. The March of Dimes. The Community Chest. They’re driving me
out of business.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: I got it, Mr. Bialystock.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Thank you, Leo. And call me Max. You
know, I don’t let everybody call me Max. It’s only people I really
like.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Okay … Max! And you can call me Leo.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: I already have. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Where would you like to eat?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Well, Max, I don’t know, Max. What do you
think, Max?</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Let me see … it’s such a beautiful day.
Why waste it indoors. I’ve got it! Let’s go to Coney Island! We’ll lunch
at the sea shore.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Coney Island??</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: What’s the matter, Leo? Don’t you like
Coney Island?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: I … I love it. I haven’t been there since I
was a kid. But it’s nearly two o’clock. I really should be getting back
to Whitehall and Marks.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Nonsense! As far as Whitehall and Marks
are concerned, you’re working with Bialystock, right?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Then stick with Bialystock!</p>

Living in a grey little room. Going to a grey little job. Leading a grey
little life.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: You’re right. You’re absolutely right. I’m a

your permission, I would like to propose a toast to the greatest man
that ever lived. Let us say his name quietly to ourselves. The walls
have ears.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Adolph Hitler.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Sigmund Freud.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Max Bialystock.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: I vas vit him a great deal, you know.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: With whom?</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Vit the Fuhrer, of course. He liked me.
Out of all the household staff at Berchtesgarten, I vas his favorite. I
vas the only one allowed into his chambers at bedtime.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: No kidding?</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Oh, sure. I used to take him his hot milk
and his opium. Achhh, those were the days. Vat good times ve had. Dinner
parties vit lovely ladies and gentlemen, singing und dancing. You know,
not many people knew about it, but the Fuhrer vas a terrific dancer.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Really, I never dreamed …</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: That’s because you were taken in by that
verdampter Allied propaganda. Such filthy lies. But nobody said a bad
vord about Winston Churchill, did they? Oh no, Vin Vit Vinnie!
Churchill, vit his cigars and his brandy and his rotten paintings.
Couldn’t even say Nazi. He would say Narzis, Narzis. Ve vere not
Narzies, ve vere Nazis. But let me tell this, and you’re getting it
straight from the horse, Hitler vas better looking than Churchill, he
vas a better dresser than Churchill, had more hair, told funnier jokes,
and could dance the pants off Churchill!</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: That’s exactly why we want to do this
play. To show the world the true Hitler, the Hitler you knew, the Hitler

<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: How could this happen? I was so careful.
I picked the wrong play, the wrong director, the wrong cast. Where did I
go right? We forgot one important, Bloom. Adolf Hitler always drew a
crowd.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock is suddenly aware that bloom is doing
strange</strong>: THINGS AT THE NEXT DESK.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>cut to bloom. he is feverishly piling ledgers and
account</strong>: BOOKS TOGETHER. HE SWOOPS THEM UP IN HIS ARMS,
CLUTCHES THEM TIGHTLY AND BEGINS BACKING TOWARDS THE DOOR.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Don’t try to stop me. I’ve made up my
mind.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: What are you doing with those books?
Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: I’m turning myself in. It’s the only way. I’m
going to cooperate with the authorities. They’ll reduce my sentence and
then there’s time off for good behavior. And maybe I’ll get a job in the
prison library. So long.</p>
<p><strong>he turns the knob. the door is locked. he fiddles with

HE BLOCKS THE DOOR.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Leo, take it easy. Relax, you’re
overwrought. You don’t know what you’re doing. You’re acting out of
panic… GIMME THOSE BOOKS!</p>
<p><strong>bialystock lunges at bloom and grabs for the books.
bloom</strong>: STILL RETAINS A FIRM HOLD. THEY STRUGGLE BACK AND
FORTH.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: I never should have listened to you.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: I never should have listened to you.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Ohhhhhhhhh, how I hate you.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Double. Double. Double.</p>
<p><strong>with a mighty wrench, bialystock rips the books out

<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Haaaaa! Haaaaa! Haaaaa!</p>
<p><strong>bloom flips. he attacks bialystock like a crazy
kid,</strong>: SCREAMING HYSTERICALLY AND PUNCHING WITH ONE ARM AS HE
PROTECTS HIS FACE WITH THE OTHER.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: FAT! FAT! FAT! FAT! FAT!</p>
<p><strong>bialystock goes crashing to the floor under the
onslaught.</strong>: BLOOM DIVES ON TOP OF HIM. THEY ROLL ON THE FLOOR
LOCKED IN MORTAL COMBAT. SUDDENLY THREE SHOTS RING OUT IN SUCCESSION.
BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM IMMEDIATELY STOP WHAT THEY’RE DOING AND TURN TOWARD

Don’t you understand, you have broken the Siegfried Oath. You must die.
Vill you cooperate!!!</p>
<p><strong>cut to tight two shot. bialystock and bloom

<p><strong>ulla</strong>: I hear noise. You call?</p>
<p><strong>ulla</strong>: Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>she continues walking until she sees them crouched
behind</strong>: THE DESK.</p>
<p><strong>ulla</strong>: Ahhh. I see you. You like something?
Coffee?</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Coffee. Yes. That’s a good idea. Why
don’t you ask the gentleman with the gun… The gentleman who is shooting
at us… and trying to kill us… what he will have.</p>
<p><strong>ulla</strong>: You like coffee?</p>

<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Yes, please. Black. Two sugars.</p>
<p><strong>ulla</strong>: Three coffees. Two regular. One black… two

<p><strong>bialystock looks up to the fates and makes a small sound
of</strong>: DESPAIR.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: And now ve must resume hostilities. Are
you coming out from behind that desk or not?</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Not.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Cowards, miserable cringing cowards.
Clinging to life like baby butterflies. Vatch, vatch and remember. Franz
Liebkind vill show you how to die like a man!</p>
<p><strong>he places the muzzle of the gun against his temple.

<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: I’m a failure. I’m a failure. I’m a
failure.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock and bloom come out from behind desk.
bialystock</strong>: LOOKS AT HIS WATCH.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Five o’clock. Killed a whole day playing
hide-and-seek with a crazy Kraut.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: I’m not crazy. I’m inept.</p>
<p><strong>he continues to sob. bloom walks over to the
weeping</strong>: LIEBKIND AND COMFORTINGLY PATS HIM ON THE
SHOULDER.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: There, there.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Vhere? Vhere?… oh…</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: You crazy lunatic! What are you shooting
at us for? Why don’t you use this where it will do us some good? Why
don’t you shoot the actors? Liebkind, have I ever steered you wrong?</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Always.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Never mind. Listen. Every night people
are laughing at your beloved Fuhrer. Why?</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: It’s that LSD und his verdampter
babies!…</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Here. Buy bullets. Kill. Kill them
all!</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: What???</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Yes. The actors. I must destroy the
actors.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Stop! Stop! This is insanity.</p>
<p><strong>he leaps across the room and wrenches the gun from
liebkind’s</strong>: HAND.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Have you lost your mind? What are you talking
about? Kill the actors. You can’t kill the actors – they’re not animals,
they’re human beings!</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: They are? Have you ever eaten with one?
Liebkind, go! Kill!</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Liebkind, no!</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: What are you doing? We’re trapped. It’s
either the show or us. There’s no way out. What can we do, blow up the

MOVES THROUGH TUNNEL CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THE LIGHT, WE MAKE OUT THE
SHADOWY FORMS OF THREE MEN.</p>
<p><strong>camera dollies in to reveal bialystock, bloom and
liebkind.</strong>: BLOOM IS HOLDING A MINER’S LAMP. LIEBKIND IS TRYING
BRICK LOOSE FROM WALL. BIALYSTOCK IS CONSULTING MAP. BRICK COMES LOOSE.
LIEBKIND REMOVES IT.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Dynamite.</p>

BLOOM HANDS FUSE TO LIEBKIND.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind reaches into his knapsack, takes out little
black</strong>: METAL BOX WITH TWO TERMINAL CAPS AT EITHER END AND SETS
IT DOWN ON CELLAR FLOOR.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Now ve take the two fuse leads, attach
them to the terminals of the conductor and ve’re in business.</p>

In people, male to female. But electricity is strange. It’s male to

<p><strong>bialystock reaches into his pocket and hands liebkind a
roll</strong>: OF FUSE.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Now ve take the slow fuse. Tie one end to
the master connection and the other ve attach to the detonator.</p>

<p><strong>they begin to move back as liebkind slowly spools out
fuse.</strong>: THEY START UP THE STAIRS.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Vait a minute. Are you sure this is slow
fuse? It feels like qvick fuse. Shine your light on it.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: I don’t know. I don’t know. The markings
are so similar. Qvick fuse or slow fuse?</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: I must find out. It is critical.</p>
<p><strong>he strikes the match and lights the fuse. whoosh!

LIEBKIND CHARGES DOWN THE STAIRS AND CHASES AFTER THE QUICK BURNING FUSE
FOR ALL HE’S WORTH. HE CATCHES UP WITH IT JUST BEFORE IT REACHES THE
MASTER CONNECTION AND QUICKLY STAMPS IT OUT.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Let’s face it. That was dumb.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Boys, vhere is you?</p>

<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: We assumed that.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind reaches into his pocket and shows them a roll
of</strong>: FUSE.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Here. You see. This is the slow fuse. It
is much wider. It has more resistance, more density. Therefore, it burns
slower.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: You mean you had the slow fuse in your
pocket all the time and you forgot to put it on?</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Yes. Amazing isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>bialystock raises his cane and smashes liebkind on

<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Do it! Do it!</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: I can’t. I can’t do it. It’s a demon. It’s
a gargoyle, it’s a monster… but it’s still my child.</p>
<p><strong>he sobs inconsolably. bialystock roughly pushes him

OF THE EXPLOSION. NOTHING HAPPENS. AFTER A WHILE THEY ALL RAISE THEIR
HEADS CURIOUSLY.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind goes to plunger, raises handle and
examines</strong>: DETONATOR.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Here is gut… of course, of course. In
