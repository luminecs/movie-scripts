SCENE:NUMBERS, AND SOME “SCENE OMITTED” SLUGS. THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED
FOR THIS SOFT COPY.</p>
<p><strong>sunshine breaks through the roof of the cave -
present</strong>: DAY</p>
<p><strong>2nd boy</strong>: Hey, Stevie. You okay?</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: I got…I got….I got…. ….the wind knocked out
of me.</p>
<p><strong>3rd boy</strong>: Looks like a cave or something.</p>
<p><strong>2nd boy</strong>: What’s down there, Stevie? Anything?</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: Human skull.</p>
<p><strong>3rd boy</strong>: Toss it up here, dude.</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: No way, buttwipe. I found it. It’s mine.</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: Anyways, there’s bones all over the place
down here.</p>
<p><strong>3rd boy</strong>: Hey, Stevie….</p>
<p><strong>2nd boy</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>3rd boy</strong>: Hey, man. Let’s get outta here.</p>
<p><strong>low angle up from below ground level, in the dugout</strong>:
HOLE</p>
<p><strong>fire captain</strong>: This is Captain Miles Cooles…we’ve got
a rescue situation in progress…</p>
<p><strong>bronschweig</strong>: Keep those people back. Get them out of
here.</p>
<p><strong>fire captain</strong>: Move them all back. I sent four men
down after the boy. They’re not responding.</p>
<p><strong>fire captain</strong>: What about my men?</p>
<p><strong>dr. bronschweig</strong>: We’re doing all we can.</p>
<p><strong>fbi agent</strong>: We’ve evacuated the building and been
through it bottom to top. No trace of an explosive device or anything
resembling one.</p>
<p><strong>s.a.c. michaud</strong>: Have you taken the dogs through?</p>
<p><strong>fbi agent</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>s.a.c. michaud</strong>: Well, take them through again.</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: Mulder – it’s me –</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Where are you, Scully?</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: I’m on the roof.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Did you find something?</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: No. I haven’t.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: What’s wrong, Scully?</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: I’ve just climbed twelve floors. I’m hot and
thirsty and I’m wondering, to be honest, what I’m doing here.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: You’re looking for a bomb.</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: I know that. But the threat was called in
for the Federal Building across the street.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: I think they have that covered.</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: Mulder… when a terrorist bomb threat is
called in, the logical purpose of providing this information is to allow
us to find the bomb. The rational object of terrorism is to promote
terror. If you’d study model behavioral pattern in virtually every case
where a threat has turned up an explosive device. If we don’t act in
accordance with that data – if you ignore it as we have done – the
chances are great that if here actually is a bomb we might not find it.
Lives could be lost –</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: Mulder…?</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: What happened to playing a hunch?</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: Jesus, Mulder…</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: The element of surprise, Scully. Random acts
of unpredictability. If we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect
the unexpected in a universe of infinite possibilities, we find
ourselves at the mercy of anyone or anything that cannot be programmed,
categorized or easily referenced…</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: What are we doing up here? It’s hotter than
hell.</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: I know you’re bored in this assignment, but
unconventional thinking is only going to get you into trouble now.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: How’s that?</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: You’ve got to quit looking for what isn’t
there. They’ve closed the X-Files. There’s procedure to be followed
here. Protocol.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: What do you say we call in a bomb threat for
Houston. I think it’s free beer night at the Astrodome.</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: Now what?</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: It’s locked?</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: So much for anticipating the unforeseen…</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: Had you.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: No you didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: Oh yeah. Had you big time.</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: I saw your face, Mulder. There was a moment
of panic.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Panic? Have you ever seen me panic,
Scully?</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: I just did. You’re buying.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Alright… what’ll it be: Coke, Pepsi? A
saline IV?</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: Something sweet.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Oh, come on.</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: Scully…</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Scully, I found the bomb.</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: Where are you, Mulder?</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: I’m in the vending room.</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: Is that you pounding?</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Scully, get somebody to open this door.</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: Nice try, Mulder.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Scully – listen to me. It’s in the coke
machine. You’ve got about fourteen minutes to get this building
evacuated.</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: C’mon. Open the door.</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: Mulder? Tell me this is a joke.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Thirteen fifty nine, thirteen fifty eight,
thirteen fifty seven…</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: …thirteen fifty six…</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: Hang on. I’m gonna get you out of there.</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: I need this building evacuated and cleared
out in ten minutes! I need you to get on the phone and tell the fire
department to block off the city center in one mile radius around the
building –</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: In ten minutes…..?!</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: DON’T THINK! JUST PICK UP THE PHONE AND MAKE
IT HAPPEN!</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: This is Special Agent Dana Scully. I need to
speak to S.A.C. Michaud. He’s got the wrong building –</p>
<p><strong>s.a.c. michaud</strong>: Where is it?</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: Mulder found it in a vending machine. He’s
locked in with it.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Scully?</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: Mulder. Move away from the door. We’re
coming through it.</p>
<p><strong>s.a.c. michaud</strong>: Go.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Tell me this is just soda pop in those
canisters.</p>
<p><strong>s.a.c. michaud</strong>: No. It’s what it looks like. A big
I.E.D. - ten gallons of astrolite. Okay, get everybody out of here and
clear the building.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Somebody’s got to stay with you –</p>
<p><strong>s.a.c. michaud</strong>: I gave you an order. Now get the
hell out of here and evacuate the area.</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: Can you defuse it?</p>
<p><strong>s.a.c. michaud</strong>: I think so.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: You’ve got about four minutes to find out if
you’re wrong.</p>
<p><strong>s.a.c. michaud</strong>: Did you hear what I said?</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: Let’s go, Mulder.</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: What are you doing? Mulder –</p>
<p><strong>last agent out</strong>: All clear.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Something’s wrong.</p>
<p><strong>windbreakered agent</strong>: What’s he doing?</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Something’s not right…</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: – Mulder! Get in the car!</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: There’s no time!</p>
<p><strong>hard cut back</strong>: TO:</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Next time you’re buying.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: In light of Waco, and Ruby Ridge…</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: …there is a heightened need at the
Attorney General’s office to place responsibility as early as
possible.</p>
<p><strong>cassidy</strong>: …for the catastrophic destruction of public
property and the loss of life due to terrorist activities…</p>
<p><strong>cassidy</strong>: Many details are still unclear; some
agents’ reports have not been filed, or have come in sketchy, without a
satisfactory accounting of the events that led to the destruction in
Dallas. But we’re under some pressure to give an accurate picture of
what happened to the Attorney General, so she can issue a public
statement.</p>
<p><strong>cassidy</strong>: We now know that five people died in the
explosion. Special Agent in Charge Darius Michaud who was trying to
defuse the bomb that had been hidden in a vending machine. Three firemen
from Dallas, and a young boy.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Excuse me – the firemen and the boy – they
were in the building?</p>
<p><strong>cassidy</strong>: Agent Mulder, since you weren’t able to be
on time for this hearing, I’m going to ask you to step outside so that
we can get Agent Scully’s version of the facts. So that she won’t have
to be paid the same disrespect.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: We were told the building was clear.</p>
<p><strong>cassidy</strong>: You’ll get your turn, Agent Mulder. Please
step out.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: It does say there in your paperwork that we
were the ones who found the bomb…</p>
<p><strong>cassidy</strong>: Thank you, Agent Mulder. We’ll call you in
shortly.</p>
<p><strong>skinner</strong>: Sit down, they’re still talking to Agent
Scully.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>skinner</strong>: – They’re asking her for a narrative. They
want to know why she was in the wrong building.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: She was with me.</p>
<p><strong>skinner</strong>: You don’t see what’s going on here, do you?
There’s four hundred million dollars in damage to the city of Dallas.
Lives have been lost. No suspects have been named. So the story being
shaped is this could have been prevented. That the FBI didn’t do its
job.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: And they want to blame us?</p>
<p><strong>skinner</strong>: Agent Mulder – we both know that if you and
Agent Scully hadn’t taken the initiative to search the adjacent
building, you could have multiplied the fatalities by a hundred –</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: But it’s not the lives we saved. It’s the
lives we didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>skinner</strong>: – if it looks bad, it’s bad for the FBI
–</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: – if they want someone to blame, they can
blame me. Agent Scully doesn’t deserve this.</p>
<p><strong>skinner</strong>: She’s in there right now saying the same
thing about you.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: I breached protocol. I broke contact with
the S.A.C. I ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the
device.</p>
<p><strong>skinner</strong>: Agent Scully says it was she who ordered
you out of the building. That you wanted to go back.</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: They’re asking for you, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Whatever you told them in there, you don’t
have to protect me.</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: All I told them was the truth.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: They’re trying to divide us on this, Scully.
We can’t let them.</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: They have divided us, Mulder. They’re
splitting us up.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: What? What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow for
remediation and reassignment…</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: I think you must have an idea. They cited a
history of problems relating back to 1993.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: They were the ones that put us together.</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: Because they wanted me to invalidate your
work, your investigations into the paranormal. But I think this goes
deeper than that.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: This isn’t about you, Scully. They’re doing
this to me.</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: They’re not doing this, Mulder. I left
behind a career in medicine because I thought I might make a difference
at the FBI. When they recruited me they told me women made up nine
percent of the bureau. I felt this was not an impediment, but an
opportunity to distinguish myself. But it hasn’t turned out that way.
And now, if I were to be transferred to Omaha, or Wichita or some field
office where I’m sure I could rise, it just doesn’t hold the interest
for me it once did. Not after what I’ve seen and done.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: You’re… quitting?</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: There’s really no reason left for me to stay
anymore. Maybe you should ask yourself if your heart’s still in it,
too.</p>
<p><strong>skinner</strong>: Agent Mulder. You’re up.</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: I’m sorry. Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>barmaid</strong>: I’d say this about exceeds your minimum
daily requirement.</p>
<p><strong>barmaid</strong>: Gotta train for this kind of heavy
lifting.</p>
<p><strong>barmaid</strong>: Poopy day?</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Yup.</p>
<p><strong>barmaid</strong>: A woman? Work.</p>
<p><strong>barmaid</strong>: What do you do?</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: What do I do. I’m a key figure in an ongoing
government charade. An annoyance to my superiors. A joke among my peers.
“Spooky,” they call me. Spooky Mulder. Whose sister was abducted by
aliens when he was a kid. Who now chases little green men with a badge
and a gun, shouting to the heavens and anyone who’ll listen that the fix
is in. That our government’s hip to the truth and a part of the
conspiracy. That the sky is falling and when it hits it’s gonna be the
shitstorm of all time.</p>
<p><strong>barmaid</strong>: I think that about does it, Spooky.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Does what?</p>
<p><strong>barmaid</strong>: Why don’t you go home to the old lady –</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Sorry. Don’t have one.</p>
<p><strong>watchful man’s voice</strong>: That official FBI
business?</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>kurtzweil</strong>: Bet the Bureau’s accusing you of the same
thing in Dallas.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: How’s that?</p>
<p><strong>kurtzweil</strong>: Standing around holding your yank while
bombs are exploding.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Do I know you?</p>
<p><strong>kurtzweil</strong>: No. I’ve been watching your career for a
good while. Back when you were just a promising young agent – before
that.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: You follow me out here for a reason?</p>
<p><strong>kurtzweil</strong>: Yeah, I did.</p>
<p><strong>kurtzweil</strong>: My name’s Kurtzweil. Dr. Alvin
Kurtzweil.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: I know the name. Why?</p>
<p><strong>kurtzweil</strong>: Old friend of your father’s.</p>
<p><strong>kurtzweil</strong>: Back at the Department of State. We were
what you might call fellow travelers, but his disenchantment outlasted
mine. I never believed in the Project.</p>
<p><strong>kurtzweil</strong>: Oh, come on. Don’t pretend you don’t know
about the Project. Your father died for it. Your sister was taken
because of it.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: How’d you find me?</p>
<p><strong>kurtzweil</strong>: Heard you come here now and again.
Figured you’d be needing a little drinky tonight.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: You a reporter?</p>
<p><strong>kurtzweil</strong>: I’m a doctor, but I think I mentioned
that. OB-GYN.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Who sent you?</p>
<p><strong>kurtzweil</strong>: I came on my own. After reading about the
bombing in Dallas.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Well, if you’ve got something to tell me,
you’ve got as long as it takes me to hail a cab…</p>
<p><strong>kurtzweil</strong>: They’re going to pin Dallas on you, Agent
Mulder. But there was nothing you could’ve done. Nothing anyone could’ve
done to prevent that bomb from going off. Because the truth is something
you’d never have guessed; never have predicted.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: And what’s that?</p>
<p><strong>kurtzweil</strong>: S.A.C. Darius Michaud never tried or
intended to defuse the bomb.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: He just let it explode.</p>
<p><strong>kurtzweil</strong>: What’s the question nobody’s asking? Why
that building? Why not the Federal Building?</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: The Federal Building was too well
guarded.</p>
<p><strong>kurtzweil</strong>: No. They put the bomb in the building
across the street because it DID have federal offices. The Federal
Emergency Management Agency had a provisional medical quarantine office
there. Which is where the bodies were found. But that’s the thing…</p>
<p><strong>kurtzweil</strong>: …the thing you didn’t know. That you’d
never think to check.</p>
<p><strong>kurtzweil</strong>: Those people were already dead.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Before the bomb went off?</p>
<p><strong>kurtzweil</strong>: That’s what I’m saying.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Michaud was a twenty-two year veteran of the
bureau –</p>
<p><strong>kurtzweil</strong>: Michaud was a patriot. The men he’s loyal
to know their way around Dallas. They blew that building to hide
something. Maybe something even they couldn’t predict.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: You’re saying they destroyed an entire
building to hide the bodies of three firemen…?</p>
<p><strong>kurtzweil</strong>: And one little boy.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: I think you’re full of shit.</p>
<p><strong>kurtzweil</strong>: Do you?</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: I wake you?</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Why not? It’s three AM.</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: Are you drunk, Mulder?</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: I was until about an hour ago.</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: Is that before or after you got the idea to
come here?</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: What are you implying, Scully?</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: I thought you may have gotten drunk and
decided to come here to talk me out of quitting.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Is that what you’d like me to do?</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: Go home, Mulder. It’s late.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Get dressed, Scully.</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: Mulder – what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Just get dressed. I’ll explain on the
way.</p>
<p><strong>cigarette smoking man</strong>: You’ve got something to show
me.</p>
<p><strong>dr. bronschweig</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>dr. bronschweig</strong>: We brought the atmosphere back down
to freezing in order to control the development, which is nothing like
we’ve ever seen.</p>
<p><strong>cigarette smoking man</strong>: Brought on by what?</p>
<p><strong>dr. bronschweig</strong>: Heat, I think. The coincident
invasion of a host, the fireman, and an environment that raised his
basic body temperature above ninety eight point six.</p>
<p><strong>cigarette smoking man</strong>: This man’s still alive.</p>
<p><strong>dr. bronschweig</strong>: Technically and biologically,
though he’ll never recover.</p>
<p><strong>cigarette smoking man</strong>: How can this be?</p>
<p><strong>dr. bronschweig</strong>: The developing organism is using
his life energy, digesting bone and tissue. We’ve just slowed the
process.</p>
<p><strong>dr. bronschweig</strong>: Do you want me to destroy this one,
too? Before it gestates?</p>
<p><strong>cigarette smoking man</strong>: No. No…we need to try our
vaccine on it.</p>
<p><strong>dr. bronschweig</strong>: And if it’s unsuccessful?</p>
<p><strong>cigarette smoking man</strong>: Incinerate it. Like the
others.</p>
<p><strong>dr. bronschweig</strong>: This man’s family will want to see
the body laid to rest.</p>
<p><strong>cigarette smoking man</strong>: Tell them he was trying to
save the young boy’s life, and that he died heroically like the other
firemen.</p>
<p><strong>dr. bronschweig</strong>: Of what?</p>
<p><strong>cigarette smoking man</strong>: They seemed to buy our story
about the Hanta virus. You’ll make sure the families are taken care of
financially, along with a sizeable donation to the community. Maybe a
small roadside memorial.</p>
<p><strong>young naval guard</strong>: ID and floor you’re visiting.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: We’re going to the morgue.</p>
<p><strong>young naval guard</strong>: That area is currently off limits
to anyone other than authorized medical personnel.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: On whose orders?</p>
<p><strong>young naval guard</strong>: General McAddie’s.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: General McAddie is who requested our coming
here. We were awakened at three AM and told to get down here
immediately.</p>
<p><strong>young naval guard</strong>: I don’t know anything about
that.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Well, call General McAddie.</p>
<p><strong>young naval guard</strong>: I don’t have his number.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: They can patch you in through the
switchboard.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Hey! We don’t have time to dick around here
watching you demonstrate your ignorance in the chain of command. The
order came direct from General McAddie. Call him. We’ll conduct our
business while you confirm authorization.</p>
<p><strong>young naval guard</strong>: Why don’t you go on ahead head
and I’ll confirm authorization.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Why is a morgue suddenly off limits on
orders of a general?</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: This is one of the firemen who died in
Dallas?</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: According to this tag.</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: And you’re looking for?</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: I can tell you that without even looking at
him. Conclusive organ failure due to proximal exposure to source and
flying debris.</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: This body has already been autopsied,
Mulder. You can tell from the way it’s been wrapped and dressed.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Does this fit the description you just read
me, Scully?</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: Oh my God. This man’s tissue…</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: It’s like jelly.</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: There’s some kind of cellular breakdown.
It’s completely edematous.</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: And there’s been no autopsy performed.
There’s no Y incision here; no internal exam.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: You’re telling me the cause of death on the
report is false. That this man didn’t die from an explosion, or from
flying debris.</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: I don’t know what killed this man. I’m not
sure if anybody else could claim to either.</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: You knew this man didn’t die at the bomb
site before we got here.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: I’d been told as much.</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: You’re saying the bombing was a cover-up. Of
what?</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: I don’t know. But I have a hunch what you’re
going to find here isn’t anything that can be categorized or easily
referenced.</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: Mulder, this is going to take some time, and
somebody’s going to figure out soon enough we’re not even supposed to be
here. I’m in serious violation of medical ethics.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: We’re being blamed for these deaths. Scully,
I want to know what this man died of. Don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: I think this is it up here.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Is this Dr. Kurtzweil’s residence?</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: You got some kind of business with
him?</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: I’m looking for him.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Looking for him for what?</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Feds are looking for him, too. Real nice
business he’s got, huh?</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Selling naked pictures of little kids
over his computer.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: You looking for him for some other
reason?</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Yeah, I had an appointment for a pelvic
examination.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: You want a call if we turn up
Kurtzweil?</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: No. Don’t bother.</p>
<p><strong>kurtzweil</strong>: See this bullshit…? Somebody knows I’m
talking to you.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Not according to the men in blue.</p>
<p><strong>kurtzweil</strong>: What is it? Kiddie porn again? Sexual
battery of a patient? I’ve had my license taken away in three
states.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: They want to discredit you – for what?</p>
<p><strong>kurtzweil</strong>: For what? Because I’m a dangerous man.
Because I know too much about the truth.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: You mean that apocalyptic trash you write? I
knew your name was familiar. I just didn’t know why.</p>
<p><strong>kurtzweil</strong>: You know my work?</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Dr. Kurtzweil, I’m not interested in bigoted
ideas about race or genocide. I don’t believe in the Elders of Zion, the
Knights Templar, the Bilderburg Group or in a oneworld Jew run
government –</p>
<p><strong>kurtzweil</strong>: I don’t either, but it sure sells
books.</p>
<p><strong>kurtzweil</strong>: I was right about Dallas. Wasn’t I, Agent
Mulder?</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>kurtzweil</strong>: I picked up the historical document of
the venality and hypocrisy of the American government. The daily
newspaper.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: You said the firemen and the boy were found
in the temporary offices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Why?</p>
<p><strong>kurtzweil</strong>: According to the newspaper, FEMA had been
called out to manage an outbreak of the Hanta virus. Are you familiar
with the Hanta virus, Agent Mulder?</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: It was a deadly virus spread by field mice
in the Southwest U.S. several years ago.</p>
<p><strong>kurtzweil</strong>: And are you familiar with FEMA? What the
Federal Emergency Management Agency’s real power is? FEMA allows the
White House to suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a
national emergency. To create a non-elected government. Think about
that. What is an agency with such broad sweeping power doing managing a
small viral outbreak in suburban Texas?</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Are you saying it wasn’t such a small
outbreak?</p>
<p><strong>kurtzweil</strong>: I’m saying it wasn’t the Hanta virus.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: What was it?</p>
<p><strong>kurtzweil</strong>: When we were young men in the military,
your father and I were recruited for a project. They told us it was
biological warfare. A virus. There were rumors about its origins.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: What killed those men?</p>
<p><strong>kurtzweil</strong>: What killed them I won’t even write
about. I tell you, they’d do more than just harass me. They have the
future to protect.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: I’ll know soon enough.</p>
<p><strong>kurtzweil</strong>: What killed those men can’t be identified
in simple medical terms. My god, we can’t even wrap our minds around
something as obvious as HIV. We have no context for what killed those
men, or any appreciation of the scale in which it will be unleashed in
the future. Of how it will be transmitted; of the environmental factors
involved.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: A plague?</p>
<p><strong>kurtzweil</strong>: The plague to end all plagues, Agent
Mulder. A silent weapon for a quiet war. The systematic release of an
indiscriminate organism for which the men who will bring it on still
have no cure. They’ve been working on this for fifty years. While the
rest of the world was fighting gooks and commies these men have been
secretly negotiating a planned Armageddon.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Negotiating with whom?</p>
<p><strong>kurtzweil</strong>: I think you know. The timetable has been
set. It will happen on a holiday, when people are away from their homes.
When our elected officials are at their resorts or out of the country.
The President will declare a state of emergency, at which time all
federal agencies, all government will come under the power of the
Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA, Agent Mulder. The secret
government.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: And they tell me I’m paranoid.</p>
<p><strong>kurtzweil</strong>: Something’s gone wrong – something
unanticipated. Go back to Dallas and dig. Or you’re only going to find
out like the rest of the country, Agent Mulder. When it’s too late.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: How can I reach you?</p>
<p><strong>kurtzweil</strong>: You can’t.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: No calling Hawaii.</p>
<p><strong>mulder’s voice</strong>: Scully…?</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Why are you whispering?</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: I can’t really talk right now.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: What did you find?</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: Evidence of a massive infection.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: What kind of infection?</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Scully – listen to me. I’m going home, then
I’m booking a flight to Dallas. I’m getting you a ticket, too.</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: Mulder –</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: I need you there with me. I need your
expertise on this. The bomb we found was meant to destroy those bodies
and whatever they were infected by.</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: I’ve got a hearing tomorrow –</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: – I’ll have you back for it, Scully. Maybe
with evidence that could blow that meeting away.</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: Mulder – I can’t – I’m already way past the
point of common sense here –</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Scully…? Hello…?</p>
<p><strong>field agent</strong>: You’re looking for what amounts to a
needle in a haystack. I’m afraid the explosion was so devastating there
hasn’t been a whole lot we’ve been able to put together just yet.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: I’m looking for anything out of the
ordinary. Maybe something from the FEMA offices where the bodies were
found.</p>
<p><strong>field agent</strong>: We weren’t expecting to find those
remains, of course. They went right off to Washington.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Was there anything in those offices that
didn’t go to D.C.?</p>
<p><strong>field agent</strong>: Some bone fragments came up in the sift
this morning. We thought there’d been another fatality, but we found out
FEMA had recovered them from an archeological site out of town.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Have you examined them?</p>
<p><strong>field agent</strong>: No. Just fossils, far as I know.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: I’d like this person to take a look, if you
don’t mind.</p>
<p><strong>field agent</strong>: Let me just see if I can lay my hands
on what you’re looking for.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: You said you weren’t coming?</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: I wasn’t planning on it. Particularly after
spending a half hour in cold storage this morning. But I got a better
look at the blood and tissue samples I took from the firemen.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: What did you find?</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: Something I couldn’t show to anyone else.
Not without more information. And not without causing the kind of
attention I’d just as soon avoid right now. The virus those men were
infected with contains a protein coat I’ve never seen before. What it
did to them it did extremely fast. And unlike the AIDS virus or any
other aggressive strain, it survives very nicely outside the body.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: How was it contracted?</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: That I don’t know. But if it’s through
simple contact of blood to blood, and if it doesn’t respond to
conventional treatments, it could be a serious health threat.</p>
<p><strong>field agent</strong>: Like I said, these are fossils, and
they weren’t near the blast center, so they aren’t going to tell you
much.</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: May I?</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: You said you knew the location of the
archeological site where these were found.</p>
<p><strong>field agent</strong>: Show you right on a map.</p>
<p><strong>dr. bronschweig</strong>: I need to have those settings
checked and re-set. I need a steady minus two Celsius through the
transfer of the body, after I administer the vaccine.</p>
<p><strong>dr. bronschweig</strong>: It’s gone!</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: It’s what?</p>
<p><strong>dr. bronschweig</strong>: It’s left the body. I think it’s
gestated –</p>
<p><strong>dr. bronschweig</strong>: Wait – I see it –</p>
<p><strong>dr. bronschweig</strong>: Oh my god. Oh my god.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: You see it?</p>
<p><strong>dr. bronschweig</strong>: Yes. It’s…amazing. You want to get
down here – Jesus Lord…so much for little green men.</p>
<p><strong>dr. bronschweig</strong>: Hey – I need help.</p>
<p><strong>dr. bronschweig</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>valet’s voice</strong>: Sir – you have a call.</p>
<p><strong>int. suburban london estate - a beautiful study -</strong>:
EVENING</p>
<p><strong>well-manicured man</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>cigarette smoking man</strong>: We have a situation. The
members are assembling.</p>
<p><strong>well-manicured man</strong>: Is it an emergency?</p>
<p><strong>cigarette smoking man</strong>: Yes. A meeting is set.
Tonight in London, to determine a course.</p>
<p><strong>well-manicured man</strong>: Who called this meeting?</p>
<p><strong>cigarette smoking man</strong>: Strughold. He’s just gotten
on a plane in Tunis.</p>
<p><strong>well-manicured man</strong>: Has Strughold arrived?</p>
<p><strong>valet</strong>: They’re in the library.</p>
<p><strong>strughold</strong>: We began to worry. Some of us have
traveled so far, and you are the last to arrive.</p>
<p><strong>well-manicured man</strong>: I’m sorry. My grandson fell and
broke his leg.</p>
<p><strong>strughold</strong>: While we’ve been made to wait, we’ve
watched surveillance tapes which have raised more concerns.</p>
<p><strong>well-manicured man</strong>: More concerns than that?</p>
<p><strong>strughold</strong>: We’ve been forced to reassess our role in
Colonization by new facts of biology which have presented
themselves.</p>
<p><strong>group elder</strong>: The virus has mutated.</p>
<p><strong>well-manicured man</strong>: On its own?</p>
<p><strong>cigarette smoking man</strong>: Its effect on the host has
changed. The virus no longer just invades the brain as a controlling
organism. It’s developed a way to modify the host body.</p>
<p><strong>well-manicured man</strong>: Into what?</p>
<p><strong>strughold</strong>: A new extraterrestrial biological
entity.</p>
<p><strong>well-manicured man</strong>: My god…</p>
<p><strong>strughold</strong>: The geometry of mass infection presents
certain conceptual re-evaluations for us. About our place in their
Colonization.</p>
<p><strong>well-manicured man</strong>: This isn’t Colonization, it’s
spontaneous repopulation. All our work… if it’s true, then they’ve been
using us all along. We’ve been laboring under a lie!</p>
<p><strong>2nd elder</strong>: It could be an isolated case.</p>
<p><strong>well-manicured man</strong>: How can we know?!</p>
<p><strong>strughold</strong>: We’re going to tell them what we’ve
found. What we’ve learned. Turn over a body infected with the gestating
organism.</p>
<p><strong>well-manicured man</strong>: In hope of what? Learning that
it’s true?! That we are nothing more than digestives for the creation of
a new race of alien lifeforms?!</p>
<p><strong>strughold</strong>: Let me remind you who is the new race.
And who is the old. What could be gained by withholding anything from
them; By pretending to ignorance? Our knowledge may forestall their
plans to step up the timetable. To start Colonization early.</p>
<p><strong>well-manicured man</strong>: And if it doesn’t? By
cooperating now we’re but beggars to our demise! Our ignorance was in
cooperating with the Colonists at all.</p>
<p><strong>strughold</strong>: Cooperation is our only chance of saving
ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>cigarette smoking man</strong>: They still need us to carry
out their preparations.</p>
<p><strong>strughold</strong>: We’ll continue to use them as they do us.
If only to play for more time, to continue work on our vaccine.</p>
<p><strong>well-manicured man</strong>: Our vaccine may have no
effect!</p>
<p><strong>strughold</strong>: Well, without a cure for the virus, we’re
nothing more than digestives anyway.</p>
<p><strong>well-manicured man</strong>: My lateness may have well been
absence. A course has already been taken.</p>
<p><strong>cigarette smoking man</strong>: There are complications.</p>
<p><strong>well-manicured man</strong>: Do they know?</p>
<p><strong>cigarette smoking man</strong>: Mulder was in Dallas when we
were trying to dispose of evidence. He’s gone back there again. Someone
has tipped him.</p>
<p><strong>well-manicured man</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>cigarette smoking man</strong>: Kurtzweil, we think.</p>
<p><strong>strughold</strong>: We’ve allowed this man his freedom. His
books have actually helped us to facilitate plausible denial. Has he
outlived his usefulness to us?</p>
<p><strong>well-manicured man</strong>: No one believes Kurtzweil or his
books. He’s a toiler. A crank.</p>
<p><strong>strughold</strong>: And Mulder?</p>
<p><strong>elder</strong>: Our new situation makes us vulnerable. If he
learns information as we do, he could jeopardize the Project’s
secrecy.</p>
<p><strong>2nd elder</strong>: Control of information means control of
Mulder.</p>
<p><strong>cigarette smoking man</strong>: I can control Mulder. I’ve
always controlled Mulder.</p>
<p><strong>strughold</strong>: This may take another approach.</p>
<p><strong>well-manicured man</strong>: You can’t kill Mulder. He’s got
too much light on him.</p>
<p><strong>strughold</strong>: You need not kill a man to destroy
him.</p>
<p><strong>well-manicured man</strong>: No, you need only take away what
is most precious to him.</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: I don’t know, Mulder…</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: He didn’t mention a park.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: This is where he marked on the map, Scully.
Where he says those fossils were unearthed.</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: I don’t see any evidence of an archeological
or any other kind of digsite. Not even a sewer or a storm drain.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: You’re sure the fossils you looked at showed
the same signs of deterioration you saw in the fireman’s body in the
morgue?</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: The bone was porous, as if the virus of the
causative microbe were digesting it.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: And you’ve never seen anything like
that?</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: No. It didn’t show up on any of the
immunohistochemical tests –</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: This looks like new grass to you?</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: It looks pretty green for this climate.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Ground’s dry about an inch down. Somebody
just laid this down. Very recently, I’d say.</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: All the equipment is brand new.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: No irrigation system. Somebody’s covering
their tracks.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: Do you live around here?</p>
<p><strong>2nd boy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: You see anybody digging here?</p>
<p><strong>2nd boy</strong>: Not supposed to talk about it.</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: You’re not supposed to talk about it? Who
told you that?</p>
<p><strong>3rd boy</strong>: Nobody.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Nobody. Same nobody who put this park in?
That new equipment… They buy you these bikes?</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: I think you better tell us.</p>
<p><strong>2nd boy</strong>: We don’t even know you.</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: Well, we’re FBI agents.</p>
<p><strong>2nd boy</strong>: You’re not FBI agents.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>2nd boy</strong>: Cause FBI agents wear like suits and goofy
ties. And dresses like my mom wears to church. Like on that one
show.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Maybe you’ve been watching too much TV.</p>
<p><strong>3rd boy</strong>: They all left twenty minutes ago.</p>
<p><strong>4th boy</strong>: Going that way.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Unmarked tanker trucks… what are
archaeologists hauling out in tanker trucks?</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: I don’t know, Mulder.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: And where are they going with it?</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: That’s the first question to answer, if
we’re going to find them.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: What are my choices?</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: About a hundred miles of nothing in each
direction.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Where would they be going?</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: We’ve got two choices. One of them is
wrong.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: You think they went left?</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: I don’t know why I think they went
right.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Five years together – how many times have I
been wrong.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Hey, I was right about the bomb, wasn’t
I?</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: This is great. This is fitting.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: I’ve got to be in Washington D.C. in eleven
hours for a hearing – the outcome of which might possibly affect one of
the biggest decisions of my life. And here I am standing out in the
middle of nowhere Texas, chasing phantom tanker trucks.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: We’re not chasing trucks, we’re chasing
evidence –</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: – of what exactly?!</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: That bomb in Dallas was allowed to go off,
to hide something: bodies infected with a virus you detected
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: They haul gas in tanker trucks, they haul
oil in tanker trucks – they don’t haul viruses in tanker trucks.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Yeah, well they may this one.</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: What do you mean by haul? What are you not
telling me here?</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: This virus – it…</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: Mulder –</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: It may be extraterrestrial.</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: I don’t believe this. I don’t fucking
believe this. Y’know, I’ve been here… I’ve been here one too many times
with you, Mulder.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Been where?</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: Pounding down some dirt road in the middle
of the night. Chasing some elusive truth on a dim hope, only to find
myself standing right where I am right now: at another dead end –</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: What do you think it is?</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: I have no idea.</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: This is weird, Mulder.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Very weird.</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: Any thoughts on why anybody’d be growing
corn in the middle of the desert?</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Not unless those are giant Jiffy Pop
containers out there.</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: Cool in here. Temperature’s being
regulated.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: For the purpose of what?</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: I think we’re on top of something. I think
these are some kind of venting.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: You hear that?</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: I hear the humming. Like electricity. High
voltage maybe.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Maybe. Maybe not.</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: What do you think those are for?</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Scully….?</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: Yeah…?</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Run.</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Come on!</p>
<p><strong>ext. acres of corn - night - mulder and scully -
various</strong>: HANDHELD</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: Mulder?!</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Scully?!</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Scully?!</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: Mulder!</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: Where’d they go?</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>skinner</strong>: She’s coming in.</p>
<p><strong>cassidy</strong>: Special Agent Scully –</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: I apologize for making you wait – I’ve
brought some new evidence with me –</p>
<p><strong>cassidy</strong>: Evidence of what?</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: These are fossilized bone fragments I’ve
been able to study, gathered from the bomb site in Dallas…</p>
<p><strong>cassidy</strong>: You’ve been back to Dallas?</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>cassidy</strong>: Are you going to let us in on what exactly
you’re trying to prove –</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: That the bombing in Dallas may have been to
destroy the bodies of those firemen, so their deaths and the reason for
them wouldn’t have to be explained –</p>
<p><strong>cassidy</strong>: – those are very serious allegations, Agent
Scully –</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: Yes. I know.</p>
<p><strong>cassidy</strong>: And you have conclusive evidence of this?
Something to tie this claim of yours to the crime –</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: Nothing completely conclusive –</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: I hope to. We’re working to develop this
evidence –</p>
<p><strong>cassidy</strong>: Working with?</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: Agent Mulder.</p>
<p><strong>kurtzweil</strong>: You found something?</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Yes. On the Texas border. Some kind of
experiment. Something they excavated was brought there in tanker
trucks.</p>
<p><strong>kurtzweil</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: I’m not sure. A virus –</p>
<p><strong>kurtzweil</strong>: – You saw this experiment?</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: What did it look like?</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: There were bees. And corn crops.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: What are they?</p>
<p><strong>kurtzweil</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: A transportation system. Transgenic crops.
The pollen genetically altered to carry a virus.</p>
<p><strong>kurtzweil</strong>: That would be my guess.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Your guess?</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: What do you mean, your guess?</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: You told me you had answers.</p>
<p><strong>kurtzweil</strong>: Yeah, well I don’t have them all.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: You’ve been using me –</p>
<p><strong>kurtzweil</strong>: I’ve been using you?!</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: You didn’t know my father –</p>
<p><strong>kurtzweil</strong>: I told you – he and I were old friends
–</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: You’re a liar. You lied to me to gather
information for you. For your goddamn books. Didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Kurtzweil!</p>
<p><strong>kurtzweil</strong>: You’d be shit out of luck if not for me.
You saw what you saw because I led you to it. I’m putting my ass on the
line for you.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Your ass? I just got chased across Texas by
two black helicopters.</p>
<p><strong>kurtzweil</strong>: And why do you think it is you’re
standing here talking to me? These people don’t make mistakes, Agent
Mulder.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: What? What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: Salt Lake City, Utah. Transfer effective
immediately.</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: I already gave Skinner my letter of
resignation.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: You can’t quit, Scully.</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: I can, Mulder. I debated whether or not to
even tell you in person, because I knew –</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: We’re close to something here – we’re on the
verge –</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: You’re on the verge, Mulder – please don’t
do this to me –</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: After what you saw last night – after all
you’ve seen – you can’t just walk away –</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: I have. I did. It’s done.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Just like that –</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: I’m contacting the state board Monday to
file medical reinstatement papers –</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: I need you on this, Scully –</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: You don’t Mulder – you’ve never needed me.
I’ve only held you back. I’ve got to go.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: You’re wrong –</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: Why was I assigned to you? To debunk your
work. To reign you in. To shut you down.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: You saved me, Scully. As different and
frustrating as it’s been sometimes, your goddamn strict rationalism and
science have saved me a thousand times; have kept me honest and made me
whole. I owe you so much, Scully, and you owe me nothing. I don’t want
to do this without you. I don’t know if I can. If I quit now, they
win.</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: OUCH!!!</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: What? What happened?</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: I think… something stung me.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: It must…</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Scully…</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: Something’s wrong… I’m having – lancinating
pain – my chest. My… motor functions are being affected. I’m…</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: …my pulse feels thready and I’ve got a funny
taste in the back of my throat.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: I think you’re in anaphylactic shock –</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: No – it’s –</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Scully –</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: I’ve got no allergy. Something… this…
Mulder… I think… I think you should call an ambulance.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: This is Special Agent Fox Mulder. I have an
emergency – I have an agent down –</p>
<p><strong>1st paramedic</strong>: Can you hear me? Can you say your
name?</p>
<p><strong>1st paramedic</strong>: She’s got constriction in the throat
and larynx – are you breathing okay?</p>
<p><strong>1st paramedic</strong>: Passages are open. Let’s get her in
the van –</p>
<p><strong>1st paramedic</strong>: Coming through people – here we go.
Coming through –</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: She said she had a taste in the back of her
throat – there was no pre-existing allergy to bee-stings – the bee that
stung her may have been carrying a virus –</p>
<p><strong>2nd paramedic</strong>: A virus?</p>
<p><strong>1st paramedic</strong>: Get on the radio, tell them we have a
cytogenic reaction, we need an advise and administer –</p>
<p><strong>byers</strong>: I think he’s coming out –</p>
<p><strong>langly</strong>: He’s coming to.</p>
<p><strong>frohike</strong>: Hey, Mulder…</p>
<p><strong>frohike</strong>: Mulder…?</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Oh god…</p>
<p><strong>langly</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Tin Man. Scarecrow. Toto.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: What am I doing here?</p>
<p><strong>byers</strong>: You were shot in the head. The bullet broke
the flesh on your right brow and glanced off your temporal plate.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Penetration but not perforation.</p>
<p><strong>langly</strong>: Three centimetres to the left and we’d be
playing the harp.</p>
<p><strong>byers</strong>: They gave you a craniotomy to relieve the
pressure from a subdural hematoma. But you’ve been unconscious since
they brought you in.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: When was that?</p>
<p><strong>frohike</strong>: Two days ago. Your guy Skinner’s been here
with you around the clock.</p>
<p><strong>langly</strong>: We got the news and made a trip to your
apartment. Found a bug in your phone line.</p>
<p><strong>frohike</strong>: And one in your hall.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Scully had a violent reaction to a bee sting
–</p>
<p><strong>byers</strong>: You called 911. Except the call was
intercepted.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: They took her –</p>
<p><strong>skinner</strong>: Agent Mulder –</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Where’s Scully?!</p>
<p><strong>skinner</strong>: She’s missing. We’ve been unable to locate
her or the vehicle they took her in.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Whoever they are – this goes right back to
Dallas – it goes right back to the bombing –</p>
<p><strong>skinner</strong>: I know. Agent Scully reported your
suspicions to OPR. On the basis of her report, I sent techs over to
S.A.C. Michaud’s apartment. They picked up PSTN residues on his personal
effects consistent with the construction of the vending machine device
in Dallas.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: How deep does this go?</p>
<p><strong>skinner</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Are we being watched?</p>
<p><strong>skinner</strong>: I’m not taking any chances.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: I need your clothes, Byers.</p>
<p><strong>byers</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>skinner</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: I’ve got to find Scully.</p>
<p><strong>frohike</strong>: Do you know where she is?</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: No. But I know someone who might have an
answer. Who better.</p>
<p><strong>well-manicured man</strong>: Dr. Kurtzweil, isn’t it?
Dr. Alvin Kurtzweil?</p>
<p><strong>kurtzweil</strong>: Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>well-manicured man</strong>: You’re surprised. Certainly
you’ve been expecting some response to your indiscretion.</p>
<p><strong>well-manicured man</strong>: I’m quite sure whatever you told
Agent Mulder, you have your good reason. It’s a weakness in men our age;
the urge to confess. I forgive you that.</p>
<p><strong>kurtzweil</strong>: What are you doing here? What do you want
from me?</p>
<p><strong>well-manicured man</strong>: You must try to understand, what
I’m here to do is only to protect my children. You and I have but short
lives left. I can only hope the same isn’t true for them.</p>
<p><strong>well-manicured man</strong>: Mr. Mulder.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: What happened to Kurtzweil?</p>
<p><strong>well-manicured man</strong>: He’s come and gone.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Where’s Scully?</p>
<p><strong>well-manicured man</strong>: I have answers for you.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Is she alive?</p>
<p><strong>well-manicured man</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>well-manicured man</strong>: I’m quite prepared to tell you
everything, though there isn’t much you haven’t guessed.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: About the conspiracy?</p>
<p><strong>well-manicured man</strong>: I think of it as an agreement. A
word your father liked to use.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: I want to know where Scully is.</p>
<p><strong>well-manicured man</strong>: The location of Agent Scully.
And the means to save her life. Please…</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>well-manicured man</strong>: A weak vaccine against the virus
Agent Scully has been infected with. It must be administered with ninety
six hours.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: You’re lying.</p>
<p><strong>well-manicured man</strong>: No. Though I have no way to
prove otherwise. The virus is extraterrestrial. We know very little
about it, except that it is the original inhabitant of this planet.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: A virus?</p>
<p><strong>well-manicured man</strong>: A simple, unstoppable lifeform.
What is a virus but a colonizing force that cannot be defeated? Living
in a cave, underground, until it mutates. And attacks.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: This is what you’ve been conspiring to
conceal? A disease?</p>
<p><strong>well-manicured man</strong>: No! For God sake you’ve got it
all backwards.</p>
<p><strong>well-manicured man</strong>: Aids, the ebola virus – on the
evolutionary scale they are newborns. This virus walked the planet long
before the dinosaurs.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: What do you mean, walked?</p>
<p><strong>well-manicured man</strong>: Your aliens, Agent Mulder, your
little green men, first landed here millions of years ago. Those that
didn’t leave have been laying dormant underground since the last Ice
Age. In the form of an evolved pathogen. Waiting to be reconstituted
when the alien race from which it came returns to colonize the planet.
Using us as hosts. Against this we have no defense. Nothing but a weak
vaccine. Do you see why it was kept secret? Why even the best men – men
like your father – could not let the truth be known?</p>
<p><strong>well-manicured man</strong>: Until Dallas, we believed the
virus was simply a controlling organism. That mass infection would make
us a slave race.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: That’s why you bombed the building. The
infected firemen, the boy –</p>
<p><strong>well-manicured man</strong>: Imagine our surprise when they
began to gestate. My group has been working cooperatively with the alien
colonists, facilitating their programs. To give us access to the virus.
In false hope we might be able to secretly find a cure. So that we might
save ourselves, as the last of the species. Your father wisely refused
to believe this, choosing hope over selfishness. Hope is the only future
he had: his children, The only future any of us have.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: But… he sacrificed his own daughter. My
sister, Samantha.</p>
<p><strong>well-manicured man</strong>: The only true survivors of the
viral holocaust will be those immune to it: those vaccinated against it
and human/alien hybrids. Your father arranged for your sister’s
abduction. He allowed her to be taken to an alien hybrid program, so
that she would survive. As a clone. He had different hopes for you. That
you would uncover the truth about the Project. That you would stop it.
That you would fight the future.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Why are you telling me this?</p>
<p><strong>well-manicured man</strong>: I thought it only fair you
should know, given how hard you’ve worked.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: What happened to Kurtzweil?</p>
<p><strong>well-manicured man</strong>: As your father knew, things need
to be sacrificed to the future.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>well-manicured man</strong>: Dr. Kurtzweil is in the
trunk.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Let me out. Stop the car.</p>
<p><strong>well-manicured man</strong>: Driver.</p>
<p><strong>well-manicured man</strong>: The men I work with will stop at
nothing to clear the way for what they believe is their stake in the
inevitable future. I was ordered to kill Kurtzweil. A necessary action
to protect my grandchildren’s lives. I might just as easily kill
you.</p>
<p><strong>well-manicured man</strong>: Trust no one, Mr. Mulder.</p>
<p><strong>well-manicured man</strong>: You have precious little time.
What I’ve given you the alien colonists have no idea exists. You hold in
your hand the power to end the project.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>well-manicured man</strong>: The vaccine you hold is the only
defense against the virus. Its introduction into an alien environment
may have the power to destroy the delicate plans we’ve so assiduously
protected for the last fifty years. Or it may not.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: What alien environment?</p>
<p><strong>well-manicured man</strong>: Find Agent Scully. Save her.
Only her science can save the future.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: What about you?</p>
<p><strong>well-manicured man</strong>: My life is over. Go.</p>
<p><strong>well-manicured man</strong>: Go now!</p>
<p><strong>int. central theater - balcony - continuous - wide
on</strong>: A STADIUM-SIZED DOME –</p>
<p><strong>int. central theater - balcony - continuous - wide
on</strong>: MULDER</p>
<p><strong>man who shot mulder</strong>: C’mon. It’s all going to
hell.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Scully –</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Breathe – can you breathe?!</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: Cold…</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Hang on. I’m going to get you out of
here.</p>
<p><strong>int. upper ribbed corridor - continuous - angle
down</strong>: CORRIDOR</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: We’ve got to keep moving.</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: Where are we?</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: You got me. But I think I know what they did
with Jimmy Hoffa.</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: I can’t…</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: I can’t go any farther.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Yes you can. You’re going to make it,
Scully.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Shit –</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Scully –</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: You’re not dying on me now – godammit
godammit godammit –</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: Mulder…</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: Had you big time.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Keep breathing, Scully.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: Scully – you breathing?</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: We’ve got to run!</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: Mulder…</p>
<p><strong>jana cassidy’s voice</strong>: … in light of the report I’ve
got before me; in light of the narrative I’m now hearing…</p>
<p><strong>cassidy</strong>: … my official report is incomplete pending
these new facts I’m being asked to reconcile. Agent Scully…</p>
<p><strong>cassidy</strong>: …while there is direct evidence now that a
federal agent may have been involved in the bombing… the other events
you’ve laid down here seem too incredible on their own, and quite
frankly implausible in their connection.</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: What is it you find incredible?</p>
<p><strong>cassidy</strong>: Well…where would you like me to start?
Antarctica is a long way from Dallas, Agent Scully. I can’t very well
submit a report to the Attorney General that alleges the links you’ve
made here. Bees and corn crops do not quite fall under the rubric of
domestic terrorism.</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: No, they don’t.</p>
<p><strong>cassidy</strong>: Most of what I find in here is lacking a
coherent picture of an organization with an attributable motive. I
realize you’re very lucky to be alive Agent Scully. The ordeal you’ve
endured has clearly affected you – though the holes in your account
leave this panel with little choice but to delete these references from
our final report to the Justice Department. Until which time hard
evidence becomes available that would give us cause to pursue such an
investigation.</p>
<p><strong>scully</strong>: I don’t believe the FBI currently has an
investigation unit qualified to pursue the evidence in hand.</p>
<p><strong>cassidy</strong>: Mr. Skinner….?</p>
<p><strong>cassidy</strong>: Please ask Agent Scully to come back to
this hearing. We’re not quite finished.</p>
<p><strong>cigarette smoking man</strong>: Congratulations on your
survival. Your life is worthless now, I hope you know that.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: And yours?</p>
<p><strong>cigarette smoking man</strong>: You think you’ve stopped it.
What I’ve worked for fifty years to create. You haven’t stopped it. You
can’t stop it. You’re just one man.</p>
<p><strong>mulder</strong>: You’re wrong.</p>
