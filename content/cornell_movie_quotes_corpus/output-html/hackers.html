<p><strong>woman</strong>: Oough! Ahhh!</p>
<p><strong>secret service agent</strong>: Upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: What’s going on? What’s the matter? Who are
you?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Dade! Dade!</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Knock it down.</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: The defendant, Dade Murphy, who calls
himself “Zero Cool”, has repeatedly committed criminal acts of a
malicious nature. This defendant possesses a superior intelligence,
which he uses to a destructive and antisocial end. His computer virus
crashed one thousand five hundred and seven computer systems, including
Wall Street trading systems, single handedly causing a seven point drop
in the New York Stock Market.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Dade Murphy, I hereby fine your family
forty-five thousand dollars…</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: …and sentence you to probation, under which
you are forbidden to own or operate a computer or touch tone telephone,
until the day of your eighteenth birthday.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. murphy</strong>: Dade?</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Yeah, mom?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. murphy</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: I’m taking over a TV network.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. murphy</strong>: Finish up, honey, and get to sleep. And
happy birthday.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Security, uh Norm, Norm speaking.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Norman? This is Mr. Eddie Vedder, from
Accounting. I just had a power surge here at home that wiped out a file
I was working on. Listen, I’m in big trouble, do you know anything about
computers?</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Uhhmmm… uh gee, uh…</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Right, well my BLT drive on my computer just
went AWOL, and I’ve got this big project due tomorrow for Mr. Kawasaki,
and if I don’t get it in, he’s gonna ask me to commit Hari Kari…</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Uhhh.. ahahaha…</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Yeah, well, you know these Japanese management
techniques. Could you, uh, read me the number on the modem?</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Uhhhmm…</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: It’s a little boxy thing, Norm, with switches
on it… lets my computer talk to the one there…</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: 212-555-4240.</p>
<p><strong>commentator</strong>: …so-called American Indians, Latinos
and Blacks come from a genetically mediocre stock…</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Yak yak yak. Get a job!</p>
<p><strong>tv</strong>: You are about to experience the awe and mystery,
which reaches from the inner mind, to… The Outer Limits.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Yesssss!</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Hey! What?</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: No, wait.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Unbelievable. A hacker!</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Yeah, okay “Acid Burn”, that’s enough.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Shit on me!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. murphy</strong>: Good morning. You unpack your stuff
yet?</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. murphy</strong>: Up all night again, huh?</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Can this wait until both my eyes are open,
please?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. murphy</strong>: Can I cut the electricity to his room
so he’ll sleep normal hours? He’s been playing with his computer all
night for a solid week. Well yes, he could be playing with himself. Mmm
hmm. Yes I’ll ask. Dade, you like girls, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Well, yeah, I just haven’t found one as
charming as you yet.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. murphy</strong>: You haven’t been doing anything stupid,
right, Dade? Right, Dade?!</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Right, mom. And I’m still a virgin!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. murphy</strong>: You hooked it up to the phone, didn’t
you? Dade! Turn the shower off! You screw up again and you won’t get
into college!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. murphy</strong>: I’m sorry we had to move in your senior
year. I didn’t want to sell the house but I had to take this new job,
you know that. You’re going to love New York, it’s the city that never
sleeps!</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Yo, chill man, I’m talking to Venezuela.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Yeah, I’m sorry, I was just looking for the
principal’s office.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Sorry, I can’t help you, okay?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Do you have your transfer forms?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: It’s a relatively straightforward
question.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Do you speak English?</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Sorry, you wanted…?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I wanted transfer forms.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Are you coming?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: The gym is through there, and the cafeteria is
through there.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Great. Cool. What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Kate. Kate Libby.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Here’s your class.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: My… class. You mean I’m not in your class?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: No, you’re not in my class.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Give me time!</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Hey, you new?</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Tell him about the pool, Kate.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Pool?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Yeah, there’s an Olympic size swimming pool up
on the roof. Take the stairs over there.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Yeah! Sure.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>geek</strong>: Hey! Hold the door!</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Oh my God! He found the pool.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: I’m Mr. Simpson. And I’m subbing for
Ms. Bayliss who was arrested at the anti-fur rally. I know some of you
kids got computers at home. But these are school property, people, and I
don’t want to see any gum stuck to ’em. Chapter 1. Designing graphical
interface…</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: So, um, what’s your interest in Kate Libby, eh?
Academic? Purely sexual?</p>

<p><strong>kate</strong>: If God gave men brains bigger than dogs’, they
wouldn’t hump womens’ legs at cocktail parties.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Ruth Libby.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: I’m not so sure your mother qualifies as a
significant author of the twentieth century.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Her last book sold two million copies.</p>
<p><strong>class</strong>: Woooooo!</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: “Angel-headed hipsters burning for the

<p><strong>cereal</strong>: FYI, alright man, you can sit at home, and
do like absolutely nothing and…</p>
<p><strong>cereal</strong>: …and your name goes through like seventeen
computers a day. 1984, yeah right man, that’s a typo. Orwell’s here and
now, he’s living large. We have no names, man, no names. We are
nameless. Can I score a fry? Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>phreak</strong>: Meet Cereal Killer. As in Froot Loops? But
he does know things.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Anyways, guys, guys, listen, listen to me. I’m
in this computer right? So I’m looking around…</p>
<p><strong>phreak</strong>: D’you bring those Crayola books?</p>
<p><strong>cereal</strong>: Oh yeah, technicolor rainbow.</p>
<p><strong>cereal</strong>: Green one.</p>

<p><strong>cereal</strong>: Luscious orange?</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Computer security criteria, DOD standards.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: The Pink Shirt Book, Guide to IBM PCs. So
called due to the nasty pink shirt the guy wears on the cover.</p>
<p><strong>cereal</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Devil book. The Unix Bible.</p>
<p><strong>cereal</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Dragon book. Compiler design.</p>
<p><strong>cereal</strong>: Oh yeah? What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: The Red Book. NSA Trusted Networks. Otherwise
known as the Ugly Red Book that won’t fit on a shelf.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Anyway, anyway, guys guys guys, come on. I’m
in this computer, right. So I’m looking around, looking around, you
know, throwing commands at it, I don’t know where it is or what it does
or anything. It’s like, it’s like choice, it’s just beautiful, okay.
Like four hours I’m just messing around in there. Finally I figure out,
that it’s a bank. Right, okay wait, okay, so it’s a bank. So, this
morning, I look in the paper, some cash machine in like Bumsville Idaho,
spits out seven hundred dollars into the middle of the street.</p>
<p><strong>cereal</strong>: That’s kinda cool.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: That was me. That was me. I did that.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: You did this from your house.</p>
<p><strong>phreak</strong>: What are you, stoned or stupid? You don’t
hack a bank across state lines from your house, you’ll get nailed by the
FBI. Where are your brains, in your ass? Don’t you know anything?</p>
<p><strong>cereal</strong>: Stupid, man. It’s universally stupid.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: You guys always think I should know
everything, and you never tell me anything. Am I right?</p>
<p><strong>phreak</strong>: Alright, what are the three most commonly
used passwords?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Love, secret, and uh, sex. But not in that
order, necessarily, right?</p>
<p><strong>cereal</strong>: Yeah but don’t forget God. System operators
love to use God. It’s that whole male ego thing.</p>
<p><strong>phreak</strong>: Look, you wanna be elite? You gotta do a
righteous hack. None of this accidental shit.</p>
<p><strong>cereal</strong>: Oh yeah, you want a seriously righteous
hack, you score one of those Gibsons man. You know, supercomputers they
use to like, do physics, and look for oil and stuff?</p>
<p><strong>phreak</strong>: Ain’t no way, man, security’s too tight. The
big iron?</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Maybe. But, if I were gonna hack some heavy
metal, I’d, uh, work my way back through some low security, and try the
back door.</p>
<p><strong>cereal</strong>: Yeah but oh man, wouldn’t you just love to
get one of those Gibsons, baby? Ooooh!</p>
<p><strong>phreak</strong>: Yo, who ate all of my fries?</p>
<p><strong>cereal</strong>: Joey?!</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: What, no, nonononono, I didn’t touch your
fries. I did not touch your fries.</p>
<p><strong>phreak</strong>: Cereal, man, you owe me a pack.</p>
<p><strong>cereal</strong>: It was him, man!</p>
<p><strong>phreak</strong>: You’re psyched. You need to lay off of that
shit.</p>
<p><strong>cereal</strong>: I’m gonna hit you!</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: YES! Home run, home run. You and me Lucy.
We’re gonna show em baby.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Mr. Belford?</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: My name is the Plague.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Uh, Mr. The Plague, uh, something weird’s
happening on the net.</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: As in what, you hapless techno-weenie?</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Uh, the accounting subdirectory in the Gibson
is working really hard. We got one person online, the workload is enough
for like ten users. I think we’ve got a hacker.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Okay, okay, we need proof that we were here.
Right, uh…</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Yeah, Garbage, okay, give me Garbage.</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: Never fear. I is here.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: I’ve narrowed the activity to terminal 23.</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: Let’s echo 23, see what’s up.</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: “God” wouldn’t be up this late.</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: Shit! Get me the switching control
center.</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: I need to trace a call that’s in
progress.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Shit! Uh yeah… hold on, mom. Hold on one
second.</p>
<p><strong>joey’s mom</strong>: I mean it! Open the door, Joseph.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Yeah, uh, yeah, okay.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: There you go.</p>
<p><strong>joey’s mom</strong>: Bed. Sleep. Now!</p>
<p><strong>joey’s mom</strong>: Sweet dreams, Joey.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: He’s gone!</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: Did you get a trace?</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Yeah, we got him.</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>cereal</strong>: Nice place, huh.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: You heard of a hacker called Acid Burn? You
know who he is?</p>
<p><strong>phreak</strong>: No, don’t know who he is. Do you?</p>
<p><strong>phreak</strong>: Nikon! Lord Nikon this is…</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Crash Override.</p>
<p><strong>nikon</strong>: Never heard of you. Done anything?</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>phreak</strong>: Come on!</p>
<p><strong>nikon</strong>: What, your mom buy you a ’Puter for
Christmas? Does he know anything?</p>
<p><strong>phreak</strong>: Sure man, he’s elite.</p>
<p><strong>nikon</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>cereal</strong>: Uh… Nikon, can I… can I crash at your place
tonight?</p>
<p><strong>nikon</strong>: Again? Yeah sure.</p>
<p><strong>both</strong>: Ooka-pow!</p>
<p><strong>gill</strong>: Hackers penetrate and ravage delicate public
and privately owned computer systems, infecting them with viruses, and
stealing materials for their own ends. These people, they are
terrorists.</p>
<p><strong>cereal</strong>: Agent Richard Gill, You’re hacker enemy
number one, man. You’re a boner!</p>
<p><strong>nikon</strong>: Yo, showtime, showtime!</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>all but dade</strong>: 4…3…2…1…</p>
<p><strong>razor</strong>: Welcome to our show!</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Hack the Planet!</p>
<p><strong>all but dade</strong>: Hack the Planet!</p>
<p><strong>razor</strong>: For those late night hacks…</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Jolt Cola! The soft drink of the elite
hacker.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Who are these guys?</p>
<p><strong>nikon</strong>: That’s Razor and Blade.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Razor and Blade.</p>
<p><strong>razor</strong>: That’s right, this IS a payphone.</p>
<p><strong>razor and blade</strong>: Don’t ask.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: As you can see, this is just a simple
microcassette recorder. Hook it up to the phone and drop in five bucks
in quarters.</p>
<p><strong>razor</strong>: Record the tones that the coins make. And
hang up and get your money back!</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: And never again have to pay for a service
that would be dirt cheap…</p>
<p><strong>razor</strong>: …IF it weren’t run by a bunch of profiteering
gluttons!</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Remember, hacking is more than just a crime.
It’s a survival trait!</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: What? What? What did I do? What?</p>
<p><strong>joey’s mom</strong>: Joey!</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Get in there! Sit down!</p>
<p><strong>another agent</strong>: Stay down there. Don’t move.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Lucy!</p>
<p><strong>gill</strong>: How’s it going, Ray?</p>
<p><strong>agent ray</strong>: It looks good, sir. We’ve got an
uncorrupted hard drive.</p>
<p><strong>gill</strong>: In English, please. I didn’t spend ten years
protecting the president so I could finish my career feeling like an
idiot.</p>
<p><strong>agent ray</strong>: I’m sorry, sir. We caught him by
surprise, so we don’t think he had time to erase his computer files.</p>
<p><strong>gill</strong>: Good. Good man. Alright, let’s finish up here,
and take him in for interrogation.</p>
<p><strong>agent ray</strong>: Alright sir.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Agent Gill, can you spare a moment of your
time?</p>
<p><strong>gill</strong>: Why of course, Jennifer.</p>
<p><strong>joey’s mom</strong>: Joey!</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Mom…</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Just how dangerous are hackers?</p>
<p><strong>gill</strong>: Well, hackers penetrate and ravage delicate
public and privately owned computer systems, infecting them with
viruses…</p>
<p><strong>joey’s mom</strong>: Joey!</p>
<p><strong>gill</strong>: …and stealing sensitive materials for their
own ends. These people, they’re terrorists…</p>
<p><strong>joey’s mom</strong>: Joey!</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: Good morning, Gentlemen. Please be seated. I
see we’re still dressing in the dark, Eugene.</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: Once again, don’t call me Eugene. A recent
unknown intruder penetrated, using a superuser acount, giving him access
to our whole system.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: Precisely what you’re paid to prevent.</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: Someone didn’t bother reading my carefully
prepared memo on commonly used passwords. Now, as I so meticulously
pointed out, the for most used passwords are love, sex, secret and…
…God. So would your holiness care to change her password?</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: A hacker planted the virus.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: Virus?</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: Yesterday, the ballast program for a
supertanker training model mistakenly thought the vessel was empty, and
flooded its tanks.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: The little boat flipped over. A virus
planted in the Gibson computer system claimed responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: What, it left a note?</p>
<p><strong>virus</strong>: Unless five million dollars are transferred
to the following numbered account in seven days, I will capsize five
tankers in the Ellingson fleet.</p>
<p><strong>board member</strong>: Is that…</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: That is the virus. Leonardo da Vinci. The
problem is we have twenty six ships at sea and we don’t know which ones
are infected.</p>
<p><strong>duke ellingson</strong>: Well then, put the ships’ ballasts
under manual control.</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: There’s no such thing anymore, Duke. These
ships are totally computerized. They rely on satellite navigation, which
links them to our network, and the virus, wherever they are in the
world.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: So what are we supposed to do?</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: Well luckily, you have a gifted and talented
security officer. I traced the hacker’s call. The secret service picked
him up this morning. I’ll just search his files for the original virus
code, and then I can eliminate it.</p>
<p><strong>suit #1</strong>: Now look, now we expect you to get onto
this right away, yeah?</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>suit #1</strong>: Well, how soon?</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: Well, we’re working on it as fast as we can.
This is a very common occurrence in corporations as large as ours. You
have nothing to worry about.</p>
<p><strong>suit #2</strong>: Yeah, right.</p>
<p><strong>suit #1</strong>: Now, you’re sure about that, Mr. The
Plague?</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: Yeah, the Secret Service is helping us out
100 percent. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>suit #2</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>suit #1</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: We’ll be in touch. Talk to you later.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: What the hell was that all about?</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: I had to move fast. The hacker copied my
garbage file.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: I created Mister da Vinci so we could call
in the Secret Service. So they’d arrest the hacker, sieze his equipment,
things that we can’t do on our own.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: I don’t want to go to jail for this.</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: Relax. Think about the 25 million
dollars.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: But you’ve created a virus that’s going to
cause a worldwide ecological disaster, just to arrest some hacker
kid?</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: Basically, uhmm, yeah. Mmm hmmm.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: Jesus. You know, you’re sick, Eugene.
You…</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: Sh, sh sh sh sh.</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: I’ll take care of this.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Alright, sir.</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: I can cancel it any time. I don’t need any
program code. But it’s the perfect cover, to confiscate the disc and
find out how much of that garbage file has been copied.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: Get it! Why did I ever trust you? Get the
file. Otherwise you’ll lose all your toys.</p>
<p><strong>gill</strong>: Did you find the program for the virus on any
of the discs we confiscated?</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: No. He’s either very smart or very
stupid.</p>
<p><strong>gill</strong>: Then he stashed it somewhere, or he has an
accomplice. We’ll release him until his indictment, keep tight
surveillance, and see if he leads us to your disc.</p>
<p><strong>secret service agent bob</strong>: Unit 3 outside suspect
Joey Pardella’s apartment. Nothing to report. Suspect still grounded… by
his mother.</p>
<p><strong>agent bob</strong>: Listen to this bullshit. “This is our
world now. The world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the
baud. We exist without nationality, skin color, or religious bias. You
wage wars, murder, cheat, lie to us and try to make us believe it’s for
our own good, yet we’re the criminals. Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is
that of curiosity. I am a hacker and this is my manifesto.” Huh, right,
manifesto? “You may stop me, but you can’t stop us all.”</p>
<p><strong>agent ray</strong>: Now that’s cool.</p>
<p><strong>agent bob</strong>: Cool?</p>
<p><strong>agent ray</strong>: Yeah, cool.</p>
<p><strong>agent bob</strong>: You think it’s cool?</p>
<p><strong>agent ray</strong>: It’s cool!</p>
<p><strong>agent bob</strong>: It’s not cool. It’s commie bullshit!</p>
<p><strong>cereal</strong>: So what do you think, can I crash at your
place tonight?</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: What is it with this guy?</p>
<p><strong>phreak</strong>: His parents missed Woodstock and he’s been
making up for it since. Hey, you hear about Joey’s bust?</p>
<p><strong>cereal</strong>: Yeah. Probably had something to do with that
bank in Idaho.</p>
<p><strong>phreak</strong>: Do you think he could hack a Gibson?</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Did you talk to him?</p>
<p><strong>phreak</strong>: Nope. His mom said he’s grounded for his
next three lifetimes. He isn’t to consort with his computer friends. The
secret service is really out to get him. Hey there’s a big party
tonight, you wanna go?</p>
<p><strong>phreak</strong>: It’s at Kate’s…</p>
<p><strong>phreak</strong>: Thought so!</p>
<p><strong>gill</strong>: What the hell are you doing? Plague!</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: Gill.</p>
<p><strong>gill</strong>: I think we’ve got something.</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: Uuugh, hard copy.</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: Dade Murphy.</p>
<p><strong>agent ray</strong>: Secret Service!</p>
<p><strong>agent bob</strong>: Don’t move!</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Christ! What is the…</p>
<p><strong>agent bob</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: What are you doing, man? Get off me!</p>
<p><strong>agent bob</strong>: Just sit in the bed and keep your hands
where we can see them.</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: The year was 1988. And this nasty virus
crashed fifteen hundred systems in one day.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Fifteen hundred and seven.</p>
<p><strong>agent ray</strong>: Wow, huh!</p>
<p><strong>gill</strong>: It got you seven years probation. No computer,
couldn’t even use a touch tone phone.</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: Must have been hell, huh? Zero Cool? A virus
has been planted in the Ellingson Mineral computer system. You were our
prime suspect, till we trashed your stuff and found no trace of it.</p>
<p><strong>gill</strong>: However, we have come to believe that one Joey
Pardella is involved in this Ellingson virus. He or perhaps his
accomplice has a disk that Mr. Belford needs to disable that virus. We
want you to help us find it.</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: Gill.</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: Loser. I can’t believe you were only eleven
when you wrote this. It’s quite an impressive virus. Dade, I know how
you might feel about narking on your friends, but, we’re hackers. For
us, there’s no such thing as family and friends. We’re each our own
country, with temporary allies and enemies. I’d like to make a treaty
with you.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: I’m sorry. Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: I’m the one who understands you. Now, can we
be allies?</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Nah. I don’t play well with others.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Shit! Come on!</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: Watch which friends you do play with. A
record like yours could land you in jail, get you kicked out of school,
no colleges would take you. No future. Exiled from everyone and
everything you love.</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: I’ll be in touch.</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: I’m fine. Oh, and Dade, try to stay out of
trouble, okay?</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Blow me.</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: Thank you!</p>
<p><strong>phreak</strong>: Her mom makes big bucks writing self-help
books for women. Stuff like “Women Who Love Men Who Are Emotional
Amoebae”</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: That explains a lot.</p>
<p><strong>phreak</strong>: Yo, what’s up Nikon!</p>
<p><strong>nikon</strong>: Yo Phreak! Dade, man, you made it. Houston,
we have liftoff, 3 o’clock, check it… don’t look right away, what’s
wrong with you! Look at her man…</p>
<p><strong>nikon</strong>: Look out, man. Lisa Blair, 26 East 7th St.,
apartment 16, 555-4817, BOOM!</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: How did you know that?</p>
<p><strong>nikon</strong>: I got photographic memory. It’s a curse!
Lisa!</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Hey, how do you know my name?</p>
<p><strong>cereal</strong>: Oooo, look at that pooper man. Spandex, it’s
a privilege, not a right!</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: Hi, my name is Vickie, and I’m an
addict.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Hi, my name is Hank, and uh, I’m an
addict.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Uh, my name’s Joey but, uh, I’m not an
addict.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Nono, really, really, listen, listen to this.
I got in trouble with my computer, right, okay, and my lawyer told the
judge that I’m an addict, but I’m not addicted to my computer! No
really, really,</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: I’m not an addict. I’m not, I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Can I get some more coffee?</p>
<p><strong>phreak</strong>: Yo. Check this out guys, this is insanely
great, it’s got a 28.8 BPS modem!</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Yeah? Display?</p>
<p><strong>cereal</strong>: Active matrix, man. A million psychedelic
colors. Man, baby, sweet, ooo!</p>
<p><strong>nikon</strong>: I want it.</p>
<p><strong>phreak</strong>: I want it to have my children!</p>
<p><strong>cereal</strong>: Yeah, I bet it looks crispy in the dark.</p>
<p><strong>phreak</strong>: Yo, hit the lights.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>cereal</strong>: Shh!</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Was that her top?</p>
<p><strong>phreak</strong>: One-handed!</p>
<p><strong>cereal</strong>: Difficulty rating?</p>
<p><strong>nikon</strong>: Seven. Wow! Burn’s wetware matches her
software!</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Burn!</p>
<p><strong>nikon</strong>: What the f…</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Hey! What are you guys doing in here?</p>
<p><strong>phreak</strong>: I’m sorry, we’re sorry, just checking out
your fly laptop!</p>
<p><strong>nikon</strong>: Yeah, it’s hyped, you know… you’re in the
butter zone now, baby.</p>
<p><strong>phreak</strong>: Uh-huh!</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Yeah, it is… I wanna triple the RAM…</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: Oooh, Leopard Boy… AND the Decepticons. Uh,
Kate, Kate, you’re not going into that computer shit now, right?</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: Humm, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>cereal</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: The sensitive type.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: What is he doing in here?</p>
<p><strong>phreak</strong>: Relax, Burn, he’s my guest.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Burn. You’re Acid Burn. You booted me out
of</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: I’m Crash Override.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: You’re the moron that’s been invading my
turf?</p>
<p><strong>cereal</strong>: Whoa, whowhowhowhoa. Crash… and Burn!</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: Murphy kid turn you down?</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: I disguised myself as an Alabama State
Trooper and penetrated the FBI NCIC.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: Pervert! What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: The FBI computer holds files on twenty
million Americans. I just hacked into it.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: Congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: From here I got access to every piece of
data ever stored on Dade Murphy’s parents. His parents separated five
years ago, reconciled two years later, filed for divorce last year,
custody battle, boy chose to go with his mother. Hmm.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: So, we get the mother, we get the boy.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: What the hell are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: It’s cool, I’m just looking.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: It’s too much machine for you.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I hope you don’t screw like you type.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: It has a killer refresh rate.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Yeah. It’s not just the chip, it has a PCI
bus. But you knew that.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Indeed. RISC architecture is gonna change
everything.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Yeah. RISC is good.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: You sure this sweet machine’s not going to
waste?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Crash Override. What was it. “Mess with the
Best, Die Like the Rest?”</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Are you challenging me?</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Name your stakes.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: If I win, you become my slave.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Your slave?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: You wish. You’ll do shit work, scan, crack
copyrights, whatever I want.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: And if I win?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Make it my first born.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Make it our first date.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: You’re not gonna win.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: And you have to smile.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I don’t do dates. But I don’t lose either, so
you’re on.</p>
<p><strong>montage</strong>: Scenes of Dade and Kate preparing for the
challenge.</p>
<p><strong>phreak</strong>: So here’s the deal. The chosen contest: To
hassle Secret Service Agent Richard Gill, and get one back for Joey.</p>
<p><strong>nikon</strong>: Our decisions are final, by a vote of 2 to 1.
No appeals.</p>
<p><strong>cereal</strong>: The duel will last until we declare a
winner.</p>
<p><strong>phreak</strong>: Use only the dialups, access codes and
passwords in your collection. Can’t ask for any help from us.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Talking to me?</p>
<p><strong>phreak</strong>: Any questions?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Yeah. Whose gonna notify his next of kin?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Alright, he’s in the personal ads.
“Disappointed white male, crossdresser, looking for discreet friend to
bring dreams to reality. Leather, lace, and water sports. Transvestites
welcome.”</p>
<p><strong>gill</strong>: I… I… I know where you can stick it… I know
where you can stick it…</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: …wanna lick your earlobes… I wanna lick your
lips… I wanna lick your toes… I wanna lick your ankles…</p>
<p><strong>gill</strong>: Awww, yeah, you wanna lick something? Lick
this.</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: That’s why they call me Stallion…</p>
<p><strong>gill</strong>: Aw, that’s disgusting!</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: My heart is steaming for you…</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: …spank you with my…</p>
<p><strong>gill</strong>: Aww, Spank your ass…</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: Animal!</p>
<p><strong>gill</strong>: Hey! Hey, ow! Do you know who I am? Do you
know who I am?</p>
<p><strong>employee</strong>: This is accounting, sir. You enquired
about an employee of ours, an Agent Richard Gill?</p>
<p><strong>gill</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>employee</strong>: Our records indicate he’s deceased.</p>
<p><strong>gill</strong>: I’m what?</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Dead.</p>
<p><strong>phreak</strong>: Dead?</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Yeah. Like Rigor Mortis, Habeas Corpus.</p>
<p><strong>nikon</strong>: Very impressive.</p>
<p><strong>cereal</strong>: Super hero like even.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Yeah, whatever. What’s the score?</p>
<p><strong>phreak</strong>: Tie.</p>
<p><strong>phreak</strong>: Due to Mr. Gill’s untimely demise and
everything, I guess you two will have to improvise the next round.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Right. If I win, you wear a dress on our
date.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: And if I win, so do you.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Deal.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Oooohhhh…</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Dade. I didn’t know your size, so I
guessed.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: You are man enough to stick with the deal,
aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: You wanted to know who I am, Zero Cool? Well
let me explain the New World Order. Governments and corporations need
people like you and me. We are samurai. The keyboard cowboys. And all
those other people out there who have no idea what’s going on are the
cattle. Mooo! I need your help, you need my help. Let me help you earn
your spurs. Ahh, think about it. Enjoy the laptop, “Cool”! Tell me where
the disk is.</p>
<p><strong>joey’s mom</strong>: You look pitiful. Okay, okay, you’re not
grounded anymore.</p>
<p><strong>phreak</strong>: Yo, what’s up?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Dude dude dude, I gotta talk to you a minute,
listen listen listen. I copied a garbage file from…</p>
<p><strong>phreak</strong>: Big deal. A garbage file’s got shit in it,
Joey, come on.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Nono, it’s like hot or something. I don’t
know.</p>
<p><strong>phreak</strong>: Joey, a garbage file holds miscellaneous
data. Junk. Bits of stuff that’s been erased, man.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: I copied it from Ellingson, okay? They’re
asking me about it, alright? Will you take a look for me?</p>
<p><strong>phreak</strong>: Oh shit, Joey, you’ve got a tail.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>gill</strong>: I’m watching you…</p>
<p><strong>phreak’s mom</strong>: Ramon? Wake up. Ramon! Wake up!
Vamano. Time for school, come on.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Secret Service, don’t move!</p>
<p><strong>phreak</strong>: Deja vu!</p>
<p><strong>agent bob</strong>: Ray Sanchez, you are under arrest, under
the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986.</p>
<p><strong>phreak</strong>: What are you waiting for, arrest me
already!</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: You get one call. Uno. Understand?</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Hello, operator services.</p>
<p><strong>phreak</strong>: Hello, operator? I’m having trouble dialing
a number.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: What number please?</p>
<p><strong>phreak</strong>: 555-4202.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Just one moment.</p>
<p><strong>phreak</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>phreak</strong>: Hey, it’s me.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Phreak?</p>
<p><strong>phreak</strong>: I’m freaking! Joey wasn’t making it up! He
really hacked into Ellingson! He gave me the disc with a file he copied
and now I’m in jail! They’re charging me with some serious shit! And
there’s stuff I didn’t even do, like inserting some virus called Da
Vinci, and they keep asking about you guys.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: You think they’re going to bust us?</p>
<p><strong>phreak</strong>: Yeah! You better figure out what’s on that
disc, cause we’re being framed. It’s in that place where I put that
thing that time?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. murphy</strong>: Hi! Well, now I see what all the fuss
is about. Dade… you have company.</p>
<p><strong>cereal</strong>: It’s a nice room.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: We need your help.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Do my ears deceive me?</p>
<p><strong>cereal</strong>: Nonononono. Truce, you guys. Listen, we got
a higher purpose here, alright? A wake up call for the Nintendo
Generation. We demand free access to data, well, it comes with some
responsibility. When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as
a child, I thought as a child, but when I became a man I put away
childish things. What… It’s Corinthians I, Chapter 13, verse 11, no duh.
Come on.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Phreak and Joey are being framed. We need your
help to figure out what’s on this disc.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: I can’t. Everybody who touches that thing gets
busted, I can’t afford to get arrested, I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>cereal</strong>: Maybe I should just go to the bathroom or
something.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: What is it with you? I know we’ve been playing
games, but, we’re supposed to be on the same side and we really need
your help. I really need your help.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: I’m sorry, I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Well, could you just make a copy of the disc?
And just hide it in case we get busted, so we have something to give our
lawyers, something that hasn’t been tampered with? Can you do that?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. murphy</strong>: Listen you guys, help yourself to
anything in the fridge. Cereal has.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Okay. I’ll copy it.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Okay, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: The girl. The girl has the disc I need.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: I told you, I don’t play well with others.</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: Turn on your laptop. Set it to receive a
file.</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: Lauren Murphy is now a wanted felon in the
state of Washington. Forgery, Embezzlement, two drug convictions, plus
she jumped parole. When she’s arrested, she will not have a trial, she
will not pass go, she will go directly to jail. Then I change this file
back to the original, and your mom disappears.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: That’s bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: What can I tell you. Computers never lie,
kid. Your mom will be arrested at work, she’ll be handcuffed, and later,
strip searched.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: You lay a finger on her and I’ll kill you.</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: Kid, don’t threaten me. There are worse
things than death and, uh, I can do all of them!</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: Talk to me.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: I got it. But listen, Kate didn’t know what’s
on it. I mean, she came to me to figure it out. She’s not the one who
planted the virus. You leave her alone.</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: Hey, don’t worry, kid. If she’s innocent,
she’ll be fine. Your mommy’s safe now, okay?</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Kate, listen.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Uh, hold on…</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: I have to tell you something.</p>
<p><strong>cereal</strong>: Hold on a second!</p>
<p><strong>nikon</strong>: Look at this, it’s so lean and clean.</p>
<p><strong>cereal</strong>: Looks like a hacker wrote it.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Come here, look at this. This thing is
dense.</p>
<p><strong>nikon</strong>: But that’s ill, man. It’s incomplete. This is
taking forever and a day to figure out. I’m gonna make some coffee.</p>
<p><strong>cereal</strong>: Tag, you’re in.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: This isn’t a virus. It’s a worm!</p>
<p><strong>nikon</strong>: What’s this one eat?</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: It nibbles. You see this?</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: This is every financial transaction Ellingson
conducts, yeah? From million dollar deals to the ten bucks some guy pays
for gas.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: The worm eats a few cents from each
transaction.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: And no one’s caught it because the money isn’t
really gone. It’s just data being shifted around.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Right. And when the worm’s ready, it zips out
with the money and erases its tracks.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Joey got cut off before he got to that part.
Check it out. By this point, it’s already running at, what, twice the
speed as when it started.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Right, and at this rate it ends its run
in…</p>
<p><strong>nikon</strong>: Two days.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: And judging by this segment alone, it’s
already eaten about…</p>
<p><strong>cereal</strong>: 21.8 million bucks, man.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Whoever wrote this needs somebody to take the
fall. And that’s Phreak, and that’s Joey, and that’s us. We’ve got to
get the rest of the file, so we can find out where the money is going
before the worm disappears, so we can find out WHO created it.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: I know, I know who wrote it.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: This Ellingson security creep. I gave him a
copy of the disc you gave me.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: You what?</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: I didn’t know what was on it.</p>
<p><strong>cereal</strong>: Oh man. That’s universally stupid, man!</p>
<p><strong>nikon</strong>: Yo, man, you an amateur, man.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Why did he come to you?</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: I got a record. I was Zero Cool.</p>
<p><strong>nikon</strong>: Zero Cool? Crashed fifteen hundred and seven
systems in one day?</p>
<p><strong>nikon</strong>: Biggest crash in history, front page, New
York Times, August 10th, 1988. I thought you was black, man! Yo, man,
this is Zero Cool! Oh, shit!</p>
<p><strong>cereal</strong>: That’s far out!</p>
<p><strong>nikon</strong>: This is Zero Cool, man! Whooo, haha!</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Well that’s great. There goes MIT.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: I’ll make it up to you!</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: I’ll hack the Gibson.</p>
<p><strong>nikon</strong>: They’ll trace you like that man, cops are
gonna find you, they’re gonna find you with a smoking gun.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Fucked if I care, man.</p>
<p><strong>nikon</strong>: Look, even if you had the passwords, it’ll
take you ten minutes to get in, and you’ve still gotta find the files,
man, I mean, the cops will have you in… five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>cereal</strong>: Oh wow, we are fried.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Never send a boy to do a woman’s job. With me,
we can do it in seven.</p>
<p><strong>cereal</strong>: You’re both screwed. I help, we can do it in
six.</p>
<p><strong>nikon</strong>: Jesus, I gotta save all your asses. I help,
we can do it in five minutes, man.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Okay. Let’s go shopping.</p>
<p><strong>cereal</strong>: Woo hoo! Boom!</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: You know, if I didn’t live by a strict code of
honor, I might take advantage of this situation. Erotically, as it
were.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Alright, hold it right there!</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Shit!!</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: It’s my subway defense system.</p>
<p><strong>nikon</strong>: He’s way down there.</p>
<p><strong>cereal</strong>: Ta-da!</p>
<p><strong>nikon</strong>: Yo, brain dead, the manual!</p>
<p><strong>phone company tech</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Find it?</p>
<p><strong>cereal</strong>: Phone’s alright. The problem must be
somewhere else.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: They had a large chunk of the garbage file?
How much do they know?</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: Not everything. But enough to implicate
us.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: You said the worm was untreaceable!</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: Yeah. To civilians. But they’re hackers. But
don’t worry. All we have to do is launch the Da Vinci virus, and then
they’ll all be put away.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: Launch the Da Vinci virus? You can’t do
that!</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: No one believes the guilty. Besides, by the
time they realize the truth, we’ll be long gone with all of our
money.</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: Look, there is no right and wrong. There is
only fun and boring. A thirty year prison sentence sounds pretty dull to
me. Who do you prefer serves it, us? Or them?</p>
<p><strong>virus</strong>: Unless five million dollars are transferred
to the following numbered account in seven days, I will capsize five
tankers in the Ellingson fleet.</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: The virus goes off tomorrow morning at
10:30, and those hackers tried to get into our system again. At this
point I insist you take more strenuous action, or Ellingson Mineral will
hold the Secret Service responsible.</p>
<p><strong>gill</strong>: Get me arrest warrants on Kate Libby, alias
Acid Burn, Emmanuel Goldstein, alias Cereal Killer, Dade Murphy, alias
Crash Override, also known as Zero Cool, and Paul Cook, alias Lord
Nikon. We pick them up tomorrow morning at nine o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>cereal</strong>: Snoop onto them…</p>
<p><strong>nikon</strong>: …as they snoop onto us.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Yeah, it’s Kate.</p>
<p><strong>nikon</strong>: Hey, Burn. We got a little problem here.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Alright, so what have we got?</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Well, we have fifty passwords, plus whatever
Polaroid head here got inside Ellingson.</p>
<p><strong>nikon</strong>: Well, I got a lot, alright? I don’t know how
many but… my head hurts.</p>
<p><strong>cereal</strong>: Yo, everyone check this out. Hey, what’s the
Da Vinci virus?</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>cereal</strong>: Check this out. It’s a memo about how
they’re gonna deal with those oil spills that happened on the
fourteenth.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: What oil spills?</p>
<p><strong>nikon</strong>: Whoa, whoa. Yo, brain-dead, today is the
thirteenth.</p>
<p><strong>cereal</strong>: Well this hasn’t happened yet.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Wait a minute, the fourteenth, that’s the same
day the worm ends its run. I mean… Da Vinci virus, didn’t Phreak say
that’s what he was being charged with? Look… “Infecting ballast programs
of Ellingson tankers” - they blame hackers!</p>
<p><strong>nikon</strong>: Damn!</p>
<p><strong>cereal</strong>: A worm AND a virus? The plot thickens.</p>
<p><strong>nikon</strong>: Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, where are you going,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I got an idea. We’ve got a few hours, right,
till we get arrested. So just stay low. I’m gonna go get some help. I’ll
beep you, okay? Are you coming?</p>
<p><strong>cereal</strong>: May the Force be with you, man.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: There they are!</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Razor and Blade! They’re flakes!</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: They’re elite! Let’s get ’em.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I lost ’em. Where were you?</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: I don’t like this.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: AAAAAUGH! I definitely don’t like this!</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Ummm… we come in peace?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: We need your help. If you’re up to it.</p>
<p><strong>razor</strong>: She’s buff. Ballsy.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Let’s keep her.</p>
<p><strong>razor</strong>: Waste the dude.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: A virus called Da Vinci will cause oil spills
at 10:30 AM Eastern Time tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: It’s somehow connected with the worm that’s
stealing the money.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: We need your help to overload the Gibson so we
can kill the Da Vinci virus and download the worm program.</p>
<p><strong>razor</strong>: She’s rabid, but cute.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: See, we’re very busy. A TV network that
wishes to remain nameless has expressed an interest in our show.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Let’s go, Kate.</p>
<p><strong>razor</strong>: Wait. Nobody said no. But you are going to
need more than just two media icons like us. You need an army.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: That’s it! An electronic army! If I were us,
I’d get on the internet, send out a major distress signal.</p>
<p><strong>razor</strong>: Hackers of the World, Unite!</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: How are you going to take care of the
cops?</p>
<p><strong>cereal</strong>: Yo. I’m blowing up. It’s Kate, Grand
Central. Let’s hit it!</p>
<p><strong>cereal</strong>: Hey Joey, you made it!</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Now listen up, use your best viruses to buy us
time, we have to get into Plague’s file and copy the worm.</p>
<p><strong>cereal</strong>: Ai! Boom boom aiaiaiaiaee! Alright, that was
a little tension breaker, that had to be done, alright?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Cereal.</p>
<p><strong>cereal</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Go fix the phones.</p>
<p><strong>cereal</strong>: Roger.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Joey, take his place.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: What, me?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Take his place, man, do it. You can do it.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Ready?</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Alright, let’s boot up.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: What is it? What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: Nothing, it’s just a minor glitch.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: “Minor glitch” with you seems to turn into a
major catastrophe.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: There’s a new virus in the database.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: What’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: It’s replicating, eating up memory. What do I
do?</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: Type “Cookie”, you idiot. I’ll head ’em off
at the pass.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: We have a Zero Bug attacking all the login and
overlay files.</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: Run anti-virus. Give me a systems
display!</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: Die, dickweeds!</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: The rabbit is in the administration system.</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: Send a Flu-shot.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: Rabbit, Flu-shot, someone talk to me.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: A rabbit replicates till it overloads a file,
then it spreads like cancer.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: Cancer?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: It’s the Gibson, it’s finding us too fast.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Man, there’s too many garbage files, I need
more time.</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: They’re at Grand Central Station, lower
level. Don’t screw up.</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: Game’s over. Last chance to get out of this
without a prison sentence. You’re not good enough to beat me, you little
shit.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Yeah, maybe I’m not. But we are, you
asshole.</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: Give it up! Just give it up.</p>
<p><strong>razor</strong>: Are we fashionably late?</p>
<p><strong>sysop</strong>: We have massive infection. Multiple GPI and
FSI viruses.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: They’re coming in from remote nodes. They’re
going after the Kernal!</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: Colonel who?</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: The System Command Processor, it’s the
brain.</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: Cancer, brain… Brain Cancer?</p>
<p><strong>duke ellingson</strong>: Belford, what’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: In short, Duke, a shit storm.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: I found it! I found it!</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: This is the end, my friend. Thank you for
calling!</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Oh, shit! He got me.</p>
<p><strong>nikon</strong>: Joey’s getting stupid busy.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Joey. I need you to drop your viruses, go
after the worm. You’re the closest.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: It’s root slash period workspace slash period
garbage period.</p>
<p><strong>gill</strong>: Freeze!</p>
<p><strong>gill</strong>: Ahhh Come on!</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Kill the Gibson.</p>
<p><strong>razor</strong>: Roger that.</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: Come on you son of a bitch, is that all you
got, huh? Come on, let’s see what else you can do! You talking to me?
Huh? Hahahaha. Are you nuts? Come at me!</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: They’re in the kernal.</p>
<p><strong>da vinci virus</strong>: Help… me…</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: The tankers have stopped capsizing.</p>
<p><strong>someone else</strong>: Ballast tanks are emptying. It’ll be
okay.</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: Little pissant!</p>
<p><strong>nikon</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: We did it!</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Let’s get out of here!</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: They’re TRASHING our rights, man! They’re
TRASHING the flow of data! They’re TRASHING!</p>
<p><strong>gill</strong>: Shut up and get in the car!</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>gill</strong>: We caught ’em.</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>gill</strong>: Red handed! You won’t be having any more
trouble from them.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Me, alright? I did it. She knows shit about
computers. She… she’s just my girlfriend.</p>
<p><strong>gill</strong>: I suggest you modify your attitude. Because
you are floating. And I’m about to flush your ass.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: You’ve got a Mrs. Murphy to see you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Are you crazy? What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: I’m trying to help you.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Dade.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Thanks for your help.</p>
<p><strong>gill</strong>: Your son is in big trouble. He has violated
his probation and he has engaged in criminal activity.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. murphy</strong>: My son happens to be a genius. He
understands something happening today that you won’t comprehend if you
live to be a hundred, and he would never use what he knows to harm a
living soul.</p>
<p><strong>agent bob</strong>: The news crew you requested is here.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. murphy</strong>: Oh good. Cause I have a few things to
tell them.</p>
<p><strong>gill</strong>: Your son is facing thirty felony counts in an
ongoing investigation. You face possible arrest if you do that.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. murphy</strong>: Mister, I don’t care if I face certain
death.</p>
<p><strong>gill</strong>: Mrs. Murphy stays right here.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Oh, wow, she’s great.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: …and attacked the Ellingson’s computer
network. Is the last we’ve seen of this type of high-tech espionage?</p>
<p><strong>gill</strong>: Well, I’m afraid not. Hackers are a grave
threat to the national security. This incident just proves without a
doubt that we need increased funding to stop…</p>
<p><strong>someone</strong>: That kid cut him off!</p>
<p><strong>cereal</strong>: Hold on, boys and girls. It is I, the Cereal
Killer, making my first coast to coast, world wide, global television
appearance. Yes, that’s right, I’m here to tell you about this heinous
scheme hatched from within Ellingson Mineral.</p>
<p><strong>cereal</strong>: But for what, you ask? World domination?
Nay. Something far more tacky. A virus called Da Vinci, that when
launched, would cause Ellingson Mineral tankers to capsize was to be
blamed on innocent hackers. But this virus was really the smokescreen,
right. What could be so vitally important to protect that someone would
create such a nasty, antisocial, very uncool virus program?</p>
<p><strong>cereal</strong>: But why? Could it be to cover the tracks for
this worm program? A worm that was to steal 25 million bucks. The
password for this hungry little sucker belongs to Margo Wallace, head of
public relations at Ellingson Mineral…</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: Oh my God!</p>
<p><strong>cereal</strong>: …and Eugene Belford, Computer Security
Officer.</p>
<p><strong>gill</strong>: Son of a BITCH!</p>
<p><strong>cereal</strong>: What’s this? Is this the unnamed account in
the Bahamas where the money was to be stashed? I think so!</p>
<p><strong>cereal</strong>: Yo. I kinda feel like God!</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: Plague? Eugene?</p>
<p><strong>margo</strong>: I don’t even know how to work a VCR, let
alone a computer! Get off! Look, listen, I’ll make a deal. Eugene
Belford! I know where his mother is, I promise you. Get offa me! I need
a lawyer!</p>
<p><strong>stewardess</strong>: Here you are, Mr. Babbage. Flight time
to Tokyo should be about 14 hours today. Can I get you anything
else?</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: Just a pillow please.</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>gill</strong>: You’re welcome.</p>
<p><strong>plague</strong>: What’s going on? Let go of me! Stewardess!
I’ll never fly this airline again!</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: You look good in a dress.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: You would have looked better.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Wanna go for a swim?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I can’t believe they decided you won.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: They didn’t. The guys felt it was the only way
I’d get a date. Anyway, you’re pretty good. You’re elite.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Yeah? You know if you would have said so in
the beginning, you would have saved yourself a whole lot of trouble.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Beat that!</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: You know, I’ve been having these really
weird..</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Dreams?</p>
