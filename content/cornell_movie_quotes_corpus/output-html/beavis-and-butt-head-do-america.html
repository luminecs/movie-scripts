<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Butt-Head! Butt-Head! Hey, Butt-Head!</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Butt-Head, wake up, wake up!</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Dammit, Beavis, I was about to score. Huh
huh.</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Yeah, but check it out. It’s gone!</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: What’s gone?</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: The TV.</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Uuuuuuh, huh huh. Uuh,…</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Whoa! I think I just figured something
out Beavis.</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: This sucks.</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Yeah, heh heh.</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: This sucks more than anything that has
ever sucked before. We must find this butt-hole that took the TV.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Beavis!</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Freeze, butt-wipe!</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Butt-Head!</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Huh huh huh. Come to Butt-Head, baby.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Star in…</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Huh huh huh. That was cool.</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Dammit, it’s stuck.</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Huh huh huh. That was cool.</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Yeah, heh heh. Let’s just wheel this thing
back to the house.</p>
<p><strong>van driessen</strong>: Ah, excuse me boys. What’s going on
here?</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Uh, someone stole our TV.</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Yeah. We’re just gonna use this one. Get
outta the way. Heh heh.</p>
<p><strong>van driessen</strong>: I’m afraid that TV belongs to the
school. Mmmkay? You know, this could be a positive experience for you
guys. There’s a wonderful world out there when we discover we don’t need
TV to entertain us.</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Huh huh huh. He said “anus.”</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Entert-ain…us…an-us…Oh yeah! Heh heh. Anus.
Heh heh.</p>
<p><strong>van driessen</strong>: Have you guys heard a word I’ve
said?</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Yeah, “anus.” Huh huh huh huh.</p>
<p><strong>van driessen</strong>: Look, guys, just take the TV back to
the A.V. room right now. And try to be a little more open-minded.
Mmkay?</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: What a dork. Huh huh.</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Yeah, heh heh. He’s a anus. Heh heh.</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Huh huh huh. That was cool.</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: No it wasn’t!</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Uh,…Oh yeah.</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Whoa, check it out Beavis. I didn’t know
Anderson had a Camper.</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Yeah, heh heh. Maybe it has a TV. Heh heh.
TV.</p>
<p><strong>marcy</strong>: Oh, hello. Are you guys here to look at the
refrigerator?</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Uh, no.</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: We’re here to look at the TV. Heh heh.</p>
<p><strong>marcy</strong>: Oh, I didn’t realize it was broken. Come on
in.</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Cool. Huh huh huh.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Well that oughtta hold her. Ya know, the most
important thing you can have on a camper is a good propane regulator,
and this here’s the best one they make.</p>
<p><strong>marcy</strong>: I sure hope we can get the ’fridge fixed
before we leave.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Now Marcy, we’ve been savin’ for this trip our
whole lives and we’re gonna go come Hell or high water…</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: What the hell is that noise?</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: AAAAAAGH!!! This crap is warm!</p>
<p><strong>angle on tv</strong>: The soda Beavis spit out drips into the
inside of the TV. We see smoke and hear SIZZLING AND SHORT CIRCUIT SFX.
The TV goes dead.</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Beavis, you butt-hole! You broke it.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Hey, what’s goin’ on here?</p>
<p><strong>marcy</strong>: They’re here to fix the TV, Tom.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: The TV ain’t broken.</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Yeah it is. Huh huh huh.</p>
<p><strong>tom’s blurry p.o.v.</strong>: We see B&amp;B out of
focus.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Hey wait a minute. You two look kinda familiar.
Ain’t you them kids that’ve been whackin’ off in my tool shed?</p>
<p><strong>beavis &amp; butt-head</strong>: Huh huh huh huh huh.</p>
<p><strong>angle on beavis</strong>: looking particularly guilty, eyes
shifting back and forth.</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Nnnnooo. Oooooh nooooo.</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: What’s your problem Beavis?</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: I need TV now! Now! NNNNDAMMIT!!!</p>
<p><strong>butt-head’s p.o.v.</strong>: We see a flashing neon sign that
says, “TV”. Pull back to show B&amp;B are standing outside the Elite
Motel Lodge, featuring “Color TV” and “Air-Cooled Rooms”, with “Special
Nap Rates.”</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Heh heh. TV. Heh Teee Veee.</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Can we watch your TV?</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Huh huh huh. That was cool.</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Dammit! I need a TV now! We’re missing
everything!</p>
<p><strong>muddy</strong>: …Are you sure these guys can pull this off?
It’s gotta look like an accident…</p>
<p><strong>muddy</strong>: Hold on a minute. That must be them now. I’ll
call you back. … Come in!</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Aaaah. TeeeVeeeee, heh heh.</p>
<p><strong>muddy</strong>: Yer late.</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Why? Did we miss American Gladiators?</p>
<p><strong>muddy’s p.o.v.</strong>: B&amp;B are a drunken blur.</p>
<p><strong>muddy</strong>: Well, Earl said you guys were young, but
jeez… Oh well, as long as you can get the job done. So what are your
names?</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Uh, Butt-Head.</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Beavis.</p>
<p><strong>muddy</strong>: That’s alright. I’d rather not know your real
names anyways. I’m Muddy. Look, I’m gonna get right to the point. I’ll
pay you ten grand plus expenses, all payable after you do her…</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Do her? Huh huh.</p>
<p><strong>muddy</strong>: That’s right. I’m offering you ten grand plus
expenses to do my wife. We gotta deal?</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Actually, we just wanna watch TV…</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Shut up Beavis! Uh, yeah. We’ll do your
wife.</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Nnnnaah…We need to watch TV DAMMIT!!!</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Beavis, you butt-munch, this guy wants us
to score with his wife. And he’s gonna pay us. We can buy a new TV.</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Oh, heh heh really? Cool. Heh heh.</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Uh, huh huh… We’ll do it, sir.</p>
<p><strong>muddy</strong>: Okay, then let’s get down to business.</p>
<p><strong>muddy</strong>: Here she is. Her name’s Dallas. She ain’t as
sweet as she looks. She stole everything from me. Ya gotta watch out,
’cause she’ll do you twice as fast as you’d do her.</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Whoa, huh huh. Cool.</p>
<p><strong>muddy</strong>: She’s holed up in a hotel room in Las Veags.
Your flight leaves in a couple of hours. Now c’mon, I’ll drive you to
the airport.</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Holed up. Huh huh huh. Holed.</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Can we watch some TV first?</p>
<p><strong>muddy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>muddy</strong>: One more thing. Mah wife’s got this leather
satchel. It’s black, about this big. I need ya to bring it back. It’s
real important. Sentimental value… Any questions so far?</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Uh, yeah. Does she have big hooters?</p>
<p><strong>muddy</strong>: She sure does.</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: This is gonna be cool! Huh huh huh.</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Yeah, heh heh. Boooooiiiing!!!</p>
<p><strong>muddy</strong>: Just make sure it looks like an accident…</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Yeah, heh heh. I think I just had an
accident. Heh heh hmm heh hmm heh.</p>
<p><strong>muddy</strong>: Huh huh. You guys are funny. Let’s have a
drink on it.</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: We’re gonna get paid to score.</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Yeah, heh heh, and then we’re gonna get a
big-screen TV! Heh heh.</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Beavis, this is the greatest day of our
lives. Huh huh huh.</p>
<p><strong>doloris</strong>: Hi. Can I help you find your seats?</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Uuh, nah. These seats are OK.</p>
<p><strong>doloris</strong>: I think your tickets have you seated in row
fourteen, coach. So why don’t you just go ahead and move back, OK?</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: That’s OK. Someone else can have
those.</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Yeah, it’s not that important to me, really.
Those seats are too small anyways.</p>
<p><strong>doloris</strong>: Here you are.</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Hey Beavis. When she was leading us down
here, huh huh, she touched my butt. Huh huh huh.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Hello there. Are you two heading for Las
Vegas?</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Yeah, we’re gonna score.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: I hope to score big there myself. I’m mostly
going to be doing the slots.</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Yeah, I’m hoping to do some sluts too. Heh
heh. Do they have lots of sluts in Las Vegas?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Oh, there are so many slots you won’t know
where to begin.</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Whoa! heh heh. Hey Butt-Head, this chick is
pretty cool. She says there’s gonna be tons of sluts in Las Vegas! Heh
heh heh.</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Cool. Huh huh huh.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: It’s so nice to meet young men who are so
well mannered.</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Yeah, heh heh. I’m gonna have money, and a
big-screen TV and sluts everywhere!</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Oh, that’s nice.</p>
<p><strong>captain’s voice</strong>: Good morning. This is your captain
speaking. Welcome aboard flight 151 non-stop to Las Vegas. We ask that
you turn your attention to the front of the cabin for pre-flight safety
instructions.</p>
<p><strong>attendant’s voice</strong>: To fasten your seat belt, insert
the free end into the coupling.</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Insert. Huh huh huh.</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Uh…</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: Hi, I’m Tammy? Can I help you with that?</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: There you go. You’re all set.</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: I love you.</p>

<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Huh huh. Soon, she will be mine.</p>
<p><strong>captain’s voice</strong>: Flight attendants, please prepare
for take-off.</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Hey wait a minute. What’s going on?!</p>

<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Aggghg! We’re gonna die! We’re all gonna
die!</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Uh, huh huh… could you, like, do that
thing with my belt again?</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: I’m probably going to make out with her
first before we, you know, get down…</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: You’ll have to speak up son. I have this
ringing in my ears. My doctor says it could be related to my heart
palpitations. I’ve had two operations on my heart.</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Really? I poop too much.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Oh, maybe you’re lactose intolerant.</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Uh… No, I poop too much. Then I get
tired.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Well, if you find yourself getting tired,
take a couple of these.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: They perk me right up.</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Heh heh, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Uh, tastes like crap. Heh heh. Mmmmm.</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: So, uh huh huh, are you going to Las
Vegas? Huh huh huh.</p>

tonight are chicken piccata or seafood gumbo…</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Piccata? Piccata! Picattatta tatta!</p>
<p><strong>passenger</strong>: Does the gumbo have corn in it?</p>
<p><strong>angle on beavis</strong>: Turned, facing the cabin, T-shirt
pulled over his head in full Cornholio mode.</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: I am Cornholio! I need picatta for my
bunghole!</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: You’ll have to wait your turn sir.</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Are you threatening me? My bunghole will not
wait!</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Uh, I got a beer. Want some? Huh huh.</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Bargarajjjaaaahhh!!! I am Cornholio!!</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: AAAAAHHH!!! Huh huh. AAAAHHH!!!</p>

<p><strong>attendants</strong>: Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Huh huh huh. That was cool.</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Uh, huh huh, this is Las Vegas?</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Yeah, heh heh. I thought there’d be casinos
and lights and stuff.</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Hey Butt-Head, why’s that guy holding a

<p><strong>dallas</strong>: Oh, you got my bad side.</p>
<p><strong>flemming</strong>: Three days ago you pulled a job at the
Army Research Facility in Hadley, Nevada - where you stole… The X-5
unit. Now we happen to know you had the unit with you when you checked
in here, so why don’t you be a good girl and tell us where it is.</p>
<p><strong>dallas</strong>: You gonna charge me with anything? I didn’t
think so. You wanna let me go now or wait ’till my lawyer files a
wrongful arrest.</p>
<p><strong>bork</strong>: We got nothing, Chief. We tore the place
apart. We can only legally hold her for another couple of hours.</p>
<p><strong>flemming</strong>: Dammit! Where’s that damn unit??!!</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Heh heh. We’re in Washington!</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Huh huh. We’re gonna score now.</p>

<p><strong>flemming</strong>: Talk ta me, Bork.</p>
<p><strong>bork</strong>: Chief, we found a witness that says he saw two
teenagers leaving Dallas’ room shortly before we arrived.</p>
<p><strong>flemming</strong>: Did you give him a full cavity search?</p>
<p><strong>bork</strong>: Ah, the witness?</p>
<p><strong>flemming</strong>: Yes. You can never be too careful
Bork.</p>
<p><strong>bork</strong>: Well sir, I didn’t really think it was
necessary. You see we have a picture of them from the elevator security
cam. Here, have a look.</p>
<p><strong>bork</strong>: They look like a couple of kids chief.</p>
<p><strong>flemming</strong>: Bork, don’t you realize what kids today
are capable of? Don’t you read the papers?</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Beavis, huh huh, what’er you doing?</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: My butt’s bothering me!</p>

this. This here is God’s country. Unspoiled and…</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Aaaaghhh!!!…</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: That was boring. Huh huh.</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Yeah, it’s just the same thing over and over
again.</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Uh… We can’t leave Washington ’till we
find that chick.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Oh, we’re a long ways from Washington Bob.
This is the Hoover Dam.</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Damn! Heh heh hmm heh.</p>

<p><strong>muddy</strong>: I’m gonna kill ’em!</p>
<p><strong>dallas</strong>: You boys better show up.</p>
<p><strong>flemming</strong>: You see what I see, Bork?</p>
<p><strong>bork</strong>: I see it. I don’t get it.</p>
<p><strong>flemming</strong>: You got half the state looking for ya -
how do you get away?</p>
<p><strong>bork</strong>: Cut the power!</p>
<p><strong>flemming</strong>: Damn right. Bork, we’re dealing with real
pros here. My opinion, terrorists… What’s the scoop on that stolen
unit?</p>
<p><strong>bork</strong>: Well, sir it’s not good. Roll the tape… The
X-5 unit is a new top-secret biological weapon, a manmade virus…</p>
<p><strong>bork</strong>: The deadliest known to man. It could wipe out
five states in five days. It can be activated by simply entering the
right code. Here’s what happened when it was tested on a group of Army
recruits…</p>
<p><strong>flemming</strong>: Jesus Jumped-Up Christ! If this were to
fall into the wrong hands…</p>
<p><strong>bork</strong>: It gets worse. The unit wasn’t finished. It
has a flaw - the casing. If hit hard enough, it could break open,
releasing the virus.</p>
<p><strong>flemming</strong>: Okay People, as of right now these are the
most dangerous men in America. I want these faces in front of every Fed
and two- bit sheriff within a thousand miles. The orders are dead or
alive. Let’s just pray that nothing hits that unit.</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Ow! Cut it out Butt-Head.</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Huh huh. Get out of the way, Beavis, I
wanna sit by the window. Huh huh.</p>

Settle down and rest with me…</p>

I have no bunghole. Where I come from there is no</p>
<p><strong>representative</strong>: I’m terribly sorry for the
inconvenience gentlemen, but we’re going to have outside for a moment.
Follow me please.</p>
<p><strong>beavis/cornholio</strong>: You can run but you cannot hide
from the Almighty Bunghole! Heh heh hmm.</p>

<p><strong>van driessen</strong>: I’m afraid that TV belongs to the
school. Mmmkay? You know, this could be a positive experience for you

<p><strong>doloris</strong>: Hi. Can I help you find your seats?</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Uuh, nah. These seats are OK.</p>
<p><strong>doloris</strong>: I think your tickets have you seated in row
fourteen, coach. So why don’t you just go ahead and move back, OK?</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: That’s OK. Someone else can have
those.</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Yeah, it’s not that important to me, really.
Those seats are too small anyways.</p>
<p><strong>doloris</strong>: Here you are.</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Hey Beavis. When she was leading us down
here, huh huh, she touched my butt. Huh huh huh.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Hello there. Are you two heading for Las
Vegas?</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Yeah, we’re gonna score.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: I hope to score big there myself. I’m mostly
going to be doing the slots.</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Yeah, I’m hoping to do some sluts too. Heh

<p><strong>martha</strong>: Oh, there are so many slots you won’t know

first before we, you know, get down…</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: You’ll have to speak up son. I have this
ringing in my ears. My doctor says it could be related to my heart
palpitations. I’ve had two operations on my heart.</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Really? I poop too much.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Oh, maybe you’re lactose intolerant.</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Uh… No, I poop too much. Then I get
tired.</p>

<p><strong>martha</strong>: Why it’s you two. How’d ya do in Vegas?</p>

<p><strong>flemming</strong>: So, are you going to tell us where it is
or am I going to have to have Agent Hurley over there give you another
cavity search?</p>
<p><strong>dallas</strong>: Ooh is that a promise?</p>
<p><strong>flemming</strong>: Look Mrs. Scum, we know who you are. Tell
her Bork.</p>
<p><strong>bork</strong>: Dallas Grimes. Married to Muddy Grimes. You
run a mom and pop arms smuggling ring.</p>
<p><strong>dallas</strong>: Oh, you got my bad side.</p>
<p><strong>flemming</strong>: Three days ago you pulled a job at the
Army Research Facility in Hadley, Nevada - where you stole… The X-5
unit. Now we happen to know you had the unit with you when you checked
in here, so why don’t you be a good girl and tell us where it is.</p>
<p><strong>dallas</strong>: You gonna charge me with anything? I didn’t
think so. You wanna let me go now or wait ’till my lawyer files a
wrongful arrest.</p>
<p><strong>bork</strong>: We got nothing, Chief. We tore the place
apart. We can only legally hold her for another couple of hours.</p>
<p><strong>flemming</strong>: Dammit! Where’s that damn unit??!!</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Heh heh. We’re in Washington!</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Huh huh. We’re gonna score now.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Actually, we’re at the Hoover Dam.</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Damn, huh huh.</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Yeah, heh heh. Damn right!</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: So, like, where is she?</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Yeah, really.</p>
<p><strong>hoover guide</strong>: Over 40 thousand cubic tons of
concrete were used in the construction of the Hoover Dam.</p>
<p><strong>b&amp;b</strong>: Huh huh huh huh huh huh.</p>
<p><strong>hoover guide</strong>: From top to bottom, this dam is 51
stories.</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Uh, huh huh, excuse me. Is this a God
Damn?</p>
<p><strong>b&amp;b</strong>: Huh huh huh huh huh.</p>
<p><strong>hoover guide</strong>: … Generates over 6000 gigawatts of
electricity, all passing through this control room. This way.</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: This is dumb, let’s find that chick.</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Yeah, heh heh, enough’a this crap.</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Check it out Butt-Head, TV!</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Cool! Huh huh huh.</p>
<p><strong>flemming</strong>: Talk ta me, Bork.</p>
<p><strong>bork</strong>: Chief, we found a witness that says he saw two
teenagers leaving Dallas’ room shortly before we arrived.</p>
<p><strong>flemming</strong>: Did you give him a full cavity search?</p>
<p><strong>bork</strong>: Ah, the witness?</p>
<p><strong>flemming</strong>: Yes. You can never be too careful
Bork.</p>
<p><strong>bork</strong>: Well sir, I didn’t really think it was
necessary. You see we have a picture of them from the elevator security
cam. Here, have a look.</p>
<p><strong>bork</strong>: They look like a couple of kids chief.</p>
<p><strong>flemming</strong>: Bork, don’t you realize what kids today
are capable of? Don’t you read the papers?</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Beavis, huh huh, what’er you doing?</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: My butt’s bothering me!</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: You should kick your butt’s ass. Huh huh
huh.</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Dammit, all they have is shows about
water.</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: That sucks. Heh heh. They need some shows
about fire! Change the channel.</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Uh…</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Yeah, turn it up! Louder! Heh heh.</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Uh… Mas… Ter… Huh huh. Masturbation, huh
huh.</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Uh…</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Yeah, fire! Fire! FIRE!!!</p>
<p><strong>flemming</strong>: The hell’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>surgeon</strong>: Whoooooops.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I’ll tell ya, it doesn’t get any better than
this. This here is God’s country. Unspoiled and…</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Aaaaghhh!!!…</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: That was boring. Huh huh.</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Yeah, it’s just the same thing over and over
again.</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Uh… We can’t leave Washington ’till we
find that chick.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Oh, we’re a long ways from Washington Bob.
This is the Hoover Dam.</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Damn! Heh heh hmm heh.</p>
<p><strong>concierge</strong>: I swear, that’s all I know! They got on
that tour bus. It was probably heading west. Please…</p>
<p><strong>muddy</strong>: I’m gonna kill ’em!</p>
<p><strong>dallas</strong>: You boys better show up.</p>
<p><strong>flemming</strong>: You see what I see, Bork?</p>
<p><strong>bork</strong>: I see it. I don’t get it.</p>
<p><strong>flemming</strong>: You got half the state looking for ya -
how do you get away?</p>
<p><strong>bork</strong>: Cut the power!</p>
<p><strong>flemming</strong>: Damn right. Bork, we’re dealing with real
pros here. My opinion, terrorists… What’s the scoop on that stolen
unit?</p>
<p><strong>bork</strong>: Well, sir it’s not good. Roll the tape… The
X-5 unit is a new top-secret biological weapon, a manmade virus…</p>
<p><strong>bork</strong>: The deadliest known to man. It could wipe out
five states in five days. It can be activated by simply entering the
right code. Here’s what happened when it was tested on a group of Army
recruits…</p>
<p><strong>flemming</strong>: Jesus Jumped-Up Christ! If this were to
fall into the wrong hands…</p>
<p><strong>bork</strong>: It gets worse. The unit wasn’t finished. It
has a flaw - the casing. If hit hard enough, it could break open,
releasing the virus.</p>
<p><strong>flemming</strong>: Okay People, as of right now these are the
most dangerous men in America. I want these faces in front of every Fed
and two- bit sheriff within a thousand miles. The orders are dead or
alive. Let’s just pray that nothing hits that unit.</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Ow! Cut it out Butt-Head.</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Huh huh. Get out of the way, Beavis, I
wanna sit by the window. Huh huh.</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Ow! I’ll kick your butt!</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Huh huh. You mean like this?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Okay, people, next stop, Grand Canyon.</p>
<p><strong>b&amp;b</strong>: Huh huh huh huh huh.</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: The poop’s coming out of the ass of the ass.
Heh heh heh.</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Huh huh. It’s coming out of the ass, but
it’s also coming out of the ass of the ass.</p>
<p><strong>b&amp;b</strong>: Huh huh huh huh huh huh.</p>
<p><strong>ranger</strong>: There are over two hundred active geysers in
Yellowstone Park alone. Old Faithful here is one of the largest. During
an eruption the water can reach as high as two hundred feet!…</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>ranger</strong>: It shoots out over twelve thousand gallons
of water in a single eruption…</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: That’s not that much.</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Yeah really. Let’s get outta here Beavis.
Huh huh huh. This sucks.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: It’s…incredible…!</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: It’s incredible!… Huh huh huh.</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Whoa! That’s amazing! Heh heh heh.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: I can’t wait forever.</p>
<p><strong>ranger</strong>: Oh my God!</p>
<p><strong>b&amp;b</strong>: Huh huh huh huh.</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: This is the coolest thing I have ever
seen.</p>
<p><strong>bork</strong>: Chief, we got ’em! They’re on a senior
citizens tour bus going east on I-40.</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Uh… Is this the right bus?</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: You mean there’s mre than one?</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Huh huh huh. Hey Beavis. We’re on a bus
with chicks.</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Heh hmm heh heh.</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Hey, baby.</p>
<p><strong>bork</strong>: They’re not on the bus.</p>
<p><strong>flemming</strong>: These people know something. I want full
cavity searches. Everyone. Go deep on ’em.</p>
<p><strong>flemming</strong>: I tell you Bork, these guys are smart.
Damn smart. They’re probably a hundred miles away by now.</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Hey, Butt-Head, this book kicks ass! There’s
this talking snake and a naked chick and then this dude puts a leaf on
his schlong! Heh heh heh.</p>
<p><strong>b&amp;b</strong>: Huh huh huh huh huh huh.</p>

<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Uh, do you know where Washington is?</p>
<p><strong>tourist man</strong>: Yeah, ’bout 2000 miles that way.</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Cool. Huh huh huh.</p>
<p><strong>flemming</strong>: Didn’t see which way they went. Didn’t see
their vehicle. I don’t suppose you tried to stop them?</p>
<p><strong>old ranger</strong>: The most dangerous guys in America? Not
me, Sonny. I make nine dollars an hour.</p>
<p><strong>flemming</strong>: National security is the responsibility of
every American. Bork…</p>
<p><strong>bork</strong>: Cavity search…?</p>
<p><strong>flemming</strong>: Deep and hard.</p>
<p><strong>flemming</strong>: They’re not gonna get away this time. I
want roadblocks. Every road outta here for two hundred miles.</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: This sucks. It’s all hot and stuff.</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: This desert is stupid. They need to put a
drinking fountain out here.</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Yeah or like a Seven-Eleven or something…
Are we almost there?</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Uh, probably like, another five minutes
or something.</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Whoa! Check it out!</p>

<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Turn it on! Turn it on!</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Uh…</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Dammit!!!! Dammit!!!!</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Something wrong, Officer?</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Sir, we’re looking for these two
fugitives.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Why I’ll be danged. It’s those boys been
whackin’ off in my camper…</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: You saw these two?</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: I sure did. They were whackin’ off in my
tool shed. Then whackin’ off in my camper. I never seen so much whackin’
off.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Blue Den this is post nine! I have positive
ID!! Sir, I’m gonna have to ask you and your wife to step out of the
vehicle.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Well you see, me and the missus are on our
way to Washington. We got this schedule…</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Now!!!!</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Now wait right there. You’re dealing with a
veteran of two foreign wars. They’re the ones been whacking off. If I
find anything broken in there, you and I are gonna tangle!</p>
<p><strong>flemming</strong>: Masturbating in a man’s camper! We’re
dealing with two sick individuals. I want that camper torn apart, full
cavity searches all around.</p>
<p><strong>bork</strong>: Chief - just came in! Two days ago, Express
Airways had a disturbance by someone calling himself - Cornholio. Guess
who matches the description?</p>
<p><strong>flemming</strong>: Finally, a real break. Get me that
flight’s point of origin. We’re gonna kick some ass.</p>
<p><strong>dumb guy</strong>: Uh, hey. One of you kids got a match?</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Uh, my butt and your…uh, butt.</p>
<p><strong>van driessen</strong>: She flies so gracefully, over rocks,
trees and sand. Soaring over cliffs and gently floating down to land.
She proudly lifts her voice to sound her mating call. And soon her mate
responds by singing… “Caw, Caw, Caw.” Come with me, Lesbian Seagull.
Settle down and rest with me…</p>
<p><strong>van driessen</strong>: What’s going on here?</p>
<p><strong>flemming</strong>: I’ll ask the questions. Are these your
students?</p>
<p><strong>van driessen</strong>: I assume you’re a government agent. I
would think you would know there’s something in this country called due
process.</p>
<p><strong>flemming</strong>: That’s about the kind of talk I’d expect
from the guy who taught these two. Take this scum away.</p>
<p><strong>van driessen</strong>: I believe I’m supposed to be read my
Miranda Rights…</p>
<p><strong>flemming</strong>: You’ve been harboring two criminal
masterminds!</p>
<p><strong>bork</strong>: Chief, you know that guy whose camper they
were whacking off in?</p>
<p><strong>flemming</strong>: Bork! You are a federal agent. You
represent the United States Government… Never end a sentence with a
preposition. Try again.</p>
<p><strong>bork</strong>: Oh, ah… You know that guy in whose camper
they… I mean that guy off in whose camper they were whacking?</p>
<p><strong>flemming</strong>: That’s better. Yes?</p>
<p><strong>bork</strong>: We’ve run a sample through the National
Criminal Sperm Bank and come up with two possible genetic matches for a
father.</p>
<p><strong>bork</strong>: Former Motley Crue members turned
drifters.</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: You were a roadie for Motley Crue?</p>
<p><strong>dumb guy</strong>: Yup. Huh huh.</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Fire.</p>
<p><strong>dumb guy</strong>: Here’s another true story. About fifteen
years ago, we stopped in this, uh, toilet, called Highland…</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Really? That’s where we’re from.</p>
<p><strong>dumb guy</strong>: Well, then you know what I’m talking
about. Anyway, here’s the story. I scored with these two chicks. True
story.</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: You scored with two chicks?!</p>
<p><strong>dumb guy</strong>: Yeah, they were sluts. Huh huh huh.</p>
<p><strong>dumber guy</strong>: Ih hih hih hih hih hih.</p>
<p><strong>dumb guy</strong>: Shut up, dumb-ass! You didn’t score. I

<p><strong>b&amp;b</strong>: Huh huh huh huh huh .</p>
<p><strong>muddy</strong>: No, I can’t say I’ve seen ’em. I sure hope
it’s safe to drive around here.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Don’t worry, sir. Just stick to the main roads.
If they’re around, they’re probably hiding out in the desert.</p>
<p><strong>muddy</strong>: That’s good to know, Officer.</p>
<p><strong>beavis</strong>: Hey Butt-Head, are we gonna die?</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Uh, probably, huh huh…Whoa, I think my
life is like, flashing in front of my eyes!</p>
<p><strong>butt-head</strong>: Whoa, my life is cool!</p>

possibility of terrorists.</p>

have to remain top secret. But someone very special wants to give his
thanks.</p>

your fellow Americans, I extend my deepest thanks. You exemplify a fine
new crop of young Americans who will grow into the leaders of this great
country.</p>
