<h1 id="speed-racer">speed-racer</h1>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: No, that’s not exactly right. Your son
seems to be interested in only one thing. Mom knows what’s coming.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: All he talks about, all he seems capable of
thinking about is automobile racing.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Well you know, his father designs racing
cars.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: And where is your husband?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: He’s-working. He couldn’t make it.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Perhaps the apple hasn’t fallen very far
from the tree. Mom is uncomfortable with that truth while the Teacher
glances back to her records.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Is your husband’s name Rex?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: No, Rex is his older brother. Why?</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: This is the test he turned in last week.
She holds up the Scantron test that Speed was working on. The bottom
half of the ovals are filled in to spell out:</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: He continues to draw as the background
of the classroom fades to white behind him, becoming the black corner
that he is drawing on. We watch the race going on in his head as
hand-drawn cars battle each other heading for a photo-finish. Speed
makes the car noise himself including the jumping sound as two cars try
to block the Mach 5, smashing into one another as – The Mach 5 jumps
over and through the fiery crash, crossing the finish line still in the
air. Speed is lost in slow-motion revelry, making the sound of the
roaring crowd. The teacher hears him and looks up, frowning as she sees
him lost in his fantasy world. A little girl with a pink barrette also
hears him turning to watch him, a smile creeping across her face; there
is no one in the entire school like him. The teacher is about to say
something when the bell rings. Speed snaps out of his fantasy and leaps
up, in motion before anyone else.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Alright, pencils down, bring your</p>
<p><strong>tests–</strong>: Thwack! Speed slaps his down and is already
heading for the door.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: –to my desk. Ham! The door slams open and
Speed shoots out.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Speed Racer, slow down!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: He pauses crossing the street letting
two impossibly cool cars pass by. Here we begin to see the unique and
individualized nature of the automobile in the world of Speed Racer. In
this world, the grocery store parking lot looks like a car collector
show; vintage and concept cars are as ubiquitous as the Camry is in our
world. Speed dashes across the street, a tight parabolic arc around the
car, his little head sticking up like a shark fin circling until– The
car door pops open and snaps shut. The seat-belt clicks into place
before Rex even has a chance to move. He leans over and looks in the
window. Speed smiles.</p>
<p><strong>rex</strong>: .I take it you’re ready to go? Speed nods. Rex
climbs in beside him.</p>
<p><strong>rex</strong>: So, who was school?</p>
<p><strong>young speed</strong>: Fine. Are you going to the track? Mom
said you were. You don’t have to drop me off, I could just go with
you.</p>
<p><strong>rex</strong>: No way. He starts the car and roadster growls
to life.</p>
<p><strong>young speed</strong>: Oh, come on, take me with you. Come on,
please.</p>
<p><strong>rex</strong>: I can’t, Speed. Pops would kill me.</p>
<p><strong>young speed</strong>: He doesn’t have to know. I won’t say
anything. Nobody will know. Come on, please, Rex, pleaseplease
pleasepleasepleeeease. Rex sighs, knowing there’s no way he can with
this.</p>
<p><strong>rex</strong>: Are you wearing the socks? Lickety-split, Speed
sticks his sneaker up against the dash board and pulls back his pant leg
revealing– A bright red sock.</p>
<p><strong>rex</strong>: You roll us again and this’ll be the last time?
Deal? A ten year old’s grin spreads ear to ear.</p>
<p><strong>young speed</strong>: Deal.</p>
<p><strong>rex</strong>: Feel that shimmy? That’s your hind legs trying
to outrun you’re front.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: What do I do?</p>
<p><strong>rex</strong>: Stop steering and start driving. Speed gets
serious, his lips tightening the way a hand knots into a fist.</p>
<p><strong>rex</strong>: This ain’t no dead piece a metal. A car’s a
living breathing thing. She’s alive. You can feel her talking to you,
telling you what she wants, what she needs. You just gotta listen. Speed
tries to listen.</p>
<p><strong>rex</strong>: Close your eyes and listen. Speed does.</p>
<p><strong>rex</strong>: They say that Ben burns drove the last lap of
the ’68 Vanderbilt Cup with his eye closed.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: No way!</p>
<p><strong>rex</strong>: No? Well maybe you can’t hear it then. Maybe.
you ought to start hitting those books–</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: No! I hear it!</p>
<p><strong>rex</strong>: That so? Okay Mr. Burns, you tell me when to
gas it for the jump.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Speed concentrates..</p>
<p><strong>rex</strong>: Now?</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Uh-uh. The jump glides towards them as the
tires seem to whisper to Speed.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Now! Rex smiles, hitting the gas, launching
the car into the air where it seems to hang fora moment before rushing
down at us as we cut–</p>
<p><strong>local announcer</strong>: –local fan favorite, Speed racer is
just gobbling up this track, slipping car after car–</p>
<p><strong>harold lederman announcer</strong>: –no one seems able to lay
a glove on this kid–</p>
<p><strong>australian announcer</strong>: –clearly a rising star, with
several big wins since turning pro, though he remains without a major
sponsor–</p>
<p><strong>chinese announcer</strong>: –a win tonight could put him
within range of qualifying for the Grand Prix–</p>
<p><strong>french announcer</strong>: –let us hope he does not make the
same mistakes that his older brother made–</p>
<p><strong>sparky</strong>: Head’s up,.Speed! Seven o’clock. I got Snake
drafting.Pitter-pat. Speed looks into his mirror and sees a car with
orange and black markings, stacked up tight behind another car.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: I got him.</p>
<p><strong>sparky</strong>: I figure he’ll slingshot after you in the
next turn.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: I’m ready.</p>
<p><strong>sparky</strong>: Great move, Speed. Careful on the butterfly
coming up. You may wanna ease up–</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Not this time, Sparky.</p>
<p><strong>sparky</strong>: Holy canoli, Speed, You know who you’re
racing?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: He can see him.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Yeah… Just ahead, the ghost of his brother’s
car launches up the second jump and when ti comes down we are back in
the past.</p>
<p><strong>young speed</strong>: Rex’s gonna win, ain’t he, Pops? Pops
checks his watch but almost can’t believe it. He goes back to his
binoculars.</p>
<p><strong>young speed</strong>: He’s gonna win it. He’s gonna set the
course record. Nobody’s gonna catch him.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: Quiet, Speed! There’s a lotta race to run.</p>
<p><strong>young spped</strong>: No way. It’s over. My brother’s the
best racer in the world. Everybody else is running for second. The cars
rocket through the twisted mobius of steel.</p>
<p><strong>blackjack benelli</strong>: I told you to take him out!</p>
<p><strong>crew chief #1</strong>: We’re trying, sir. He’s just too
fast.</p>
<p><strong>local announcer</strong>: –it’s unbelievable folks, no one’s
seen moves like this, since that remarkable night eight years</p>
<p><strong>harold lederman announcer</strong>: –there’s no doubt in my
mind, he’s gunning for it–</p>
<p><strong>australian announcer</strong>: –driving like a man possessed,
a man haunted by his past—</p>
<p><strong>chinese announcer</strong>: –a record that has stood for
eight years set by.his,older–</p>
<p><strong>french announcer</strong>: –he is not alone out there, he is
chasing someone, he is chasing the ghost of Rex Racer–</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Pops stands beside Mom. He is still
watching the race with his trusty binos though he is now a little older,
plumper and balder.. He clicks his stopwatch, checking it at the same
time that Sprittle checks his. Sprittle stands on the chair next to
him.</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: Jeepers, he could do it, Pops. He could
really do it, couldn’t he? Pops goes back to his binos.</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: What if he does? What if he does it,
Pops?</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: Sssh!</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: I don’t know if I can watch this… He holds
the binos as though afraid to look when– A hairy hand comes in and takes
them away. Chim-chim, sitting on the chair next to Sprittle, puts the
binos to his eyes. Speed flies through a piece of tricky track drawing
another cheer. Sprittle grabs the binos back just as the beautiful young
woman, standing on the other side of Pops, lowers her. Trixie chews at
her lip, feeling a knot twist into her gut.</p>
<p><strong>blonde pack leader</strong>: My Daddy told me he used to work
for the Mishida Motorwerks but he quit.</p>
<p><strong>blonde pack leader</strong>: My daddy said that was a
completely crazy thing to do. He says the whole family is crazy.</p>
<p><strong>trixie</strong>: Speed’s not crazy.</p>
<p><strong>blonde pack leader</strong>: No, he’s just dumb. Probably the
dumbest kid in class. Ms. Waterstraat had me alphabetize the IRB tests
and you wouldn’t believe what that retard did– Sock! Trixie decks her to
the shock of the rest of the pack just as the whine grows very loud and–
Speed comes rounding the bend on a little go-cart, wearing his too-big
helmet making his big head seem ridiculously enormous. Zipping past, he
suddenly notices the girl in the pink barrette standing over another
girl; there is something about her– Maybe it’s way she’s got her fists
up, like a boy, or maybe it’s the. way her jaw is set, ready to take
on</p>
<p><strong>anyone–</strong>: Whatever it is, when their eyes suddenly
meet, he finds he is unable to look away– Staring at her, as he drives
off the road, crashing through a hedge and tumbling down a hill.</p>
<p><strong>trixie</strong>: Speed! She runs to help him. He is laying
sprawled out, his car on its side, wheels still spinning.</p>
<p><strong>trixie</strong>: Are you alright? He’s a bit groggy.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: .who are you?</p>
<p><strong>trixie</strong>: I’m Trixie. I’m in your class.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: .oh .yeah. He stares at her for a minute,
powder-puffs of clouds floating about her head.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: He, would you like to see my car</p>
<p><strong>collection</strong>: She smiles.</p>
<p><strong>trixie</strong>: I’d love to.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Hey, Rex. Hey Pops.</p>
<p><strong>re x</strong>: Hey, Speedy.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: Who’s your friend?</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Her name’s Trixie. She’s in my class.</p>
<p><strong>trixie</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: Pleasure to meet you, young lady.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Hey pops, a guy wanted me to give this to
you. He said he was a big fan. He hands him the package and Pops
smiles.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: A fan, is it? Not often we get someone with
such good taste around here. Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: He was in a hurry. Driving a ’68 Fendersin.
Sweet set. of wheels. The car description rings a bell for Rex.</p>
<p><strong>rex</strong>: Let me see that. He grabs the box, then holds
it to his ear. It’s ticking. He jams it into the go-cart, against the
pedal and slaps it in reverse. The go–.cart shoots out of the garage and
down the driveway until– It explodes, an enormous fireball ballooning up
past the tree tops. Trixie’s eyes flash with excitement.</p>
<p><strong>trixie</strong>: Cool beans!</p>
<p><strong>local announcer</strong>: –no one from these parts will
forget the tragic story of Rex</p>
<p><strong>harold lederman announcer</strong>: –he nearly ruined
racing–</p>
<p><strong>australian announcer</strong>: –single-handedly tried to
save</p>
<p><strong>chinese announcer</strong>: –one of the greatest scandals in
the history of the sport–</p>
<p><strong>french announcer</strong>: –it is always the brightest star
that burn out the fastest–</p>
<p><strong>young speed</strong>: Can I go with you, Re</p>
<p><strong>rex</strong>: Not this time, Speedy.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: When are you coming back?</p>
<p><strong>rex</strong>: I don’t know. I don’t know. He snaps the bag
shut.</p>
<p><strong>rex</strong>: Look, Speed… one day people might say things
about me. No matter what they say, I hop… I just hope you never believe
them.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: I won’t. He hugs his little brother, knowing
it might be for the last time.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: So, you’re quitting?</p>
<p><strong>rex</strong>: I have to.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: No you don’t. This is a choice. You’re selling
out, walking away from everything we’ve built here.</p>
<p><strong>rex</strong>: I’m done arguing with you Pops. He turns back
towards the door.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: Don’t you walk away from me!</p>
<p><strong>rex</strong>: You can’t tell me what to do. It’s my life to
live. He takes hold of the doorknob.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: If you walk out that door, you better not ever
come back! The door slams in response.</p>
<p><strong>on</strong>: watching a big race that Rex is in. Mom and Pops
are the couch behind him. All of them sit in.a suspended state, a fist
of tension squeezing the breath out of them. One the screen, is a cloud
of smoke billowing from a tangle of metal.</p>
<p><strong>rally announcer</strong>: Rex Racer riving the black and red
Uniron car, got in a tangle with Richenhbach, who had been favored to
win–</p>
<p><strong>color announcer</strong>: That was no tangle, he took
Richenbach out–</p>
<p><strong>rally announcer</strong>: We don’t know that but I imagine
the WRL will be reviewing this crash.</p>
<p><strong>color announcer</strong>: That’s the third DNF crash Racer’s
been involved in! Review it? Heck, the oughta just suspend him.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: Turn it off, Speed! I don’t want you watching
this anymore.</p>
<p><strong>race announcer</strong>: Rex Racer almost took Yokima’s head
off wit that jump!</p>
<p><strong>race commentator</strong>: There’s absolutely no doubt in my
mind that Rex Racer is the dirtiest driver in the world. Lit by the soft
glow of the small tv, Speed blinks and the first tears slip silently
down his cheeks.</p>
<p><strong>big mouth</strong>: I just told him the truth! His crum-bum
brother doesn’t belong on a racetrack– he belongs in jail! Speed tears
free and torpedoes Big Mouth again.</p>
<p><strong>local announcer</strong>: –the trial of Rex Racer shook the
World Racing League to tis very</p>
<p><strong>harold lederman announcer</strong>: –once a rat, always a rat
and in my book Rex Racer’s nuthin’ but a</p>
<p><strong>australian announcer</strong>: –the indictment brought down
perennial racing powerhouse</p>
<p><strong>chinese announcer</strong>: –Uniroyal was linked to the
notorious fixer Blackjack Benelli–</p>
<p><strong>french announcer</strong>: –still in prison to this day,
Benelli was rumored to be behind the Casa Cristo tragedy– The two cars
swerve, heading for a collision as we cut–</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Something happens and Mom drops her
glass. It shatters but no one seems to notice. Young Speed is transfixed
by the horror of what is playing out, the images of fire and flashing
lights, reflecting in his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>casa cristo announcer</strong>: This has to be one of the
worst crashes I have ever seen–</p>
<p><strong>casa cristo commentator</strong>: Terrible, just
terrible—</p>
<p><strong>casa cristo announcer</strong>: There is still no sign of the
driver, Rex Racer.</p>
<p><strong>local announcer</strong>: –he’s comin’hard, it’s gonna be</p>
<p><strong>harold lederman announcer</strong>: –forget the past, he’s
sayin’, this is my night–</p>
<p><strong>australian announcer</strong>: –there’s a new Racer in
town–</p>
<p><strong>chinese announcer</strong>: –poised to wipe the slate
clean–</p>
<p><strong>french announcer</strong>: –escaping the dark shadow of his
older brother– The checkered flag goes up, ready as the two cars come
screaming towards the finish line– The large digital clock seemingly
synchronized with the past as–. Speed looks over at the ghost car, the
faintest smile on his lips as he sees his older brother and then– Takes
his foot off the accelerator, letting Rex’s car surge ahead, crossing
just before Speed. The time is just over the record causing
disappointment to ripple through the crowd except for– The Racer family
who seem both relived and happy.</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: Come on, Let’s go! Victory Lane!</p>
<p><strong>french announcer</strong>: Zut alors! What a race!</p>
<p><strong>chinese announcer</strong>: –by a cat’s whisker–</p>
<p><strong>australian announcer</strong>: –the record still stands–</p>
<p><strong>harold lederman announcer</strong>: –looked like he pulled up
to me–</p>
<p><strong>local announcer</strong>: –Folks, I knew Rex Racer and if
he’s up there somewhere watching this race, you can bet your ass, he’s
damn proud of his little brother.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: A beautiful woman wearing nerdy-glasses
sits watching the television from the leather banquette. She has a body
made of the same kind of lines that a sports car or a high-heel has,
lines that make your head turn. This is Minx. Beside her is a brooding,
muscled man, his attention we don’t riveted as Speed pulls into Victory
Lane. Though see his face, this is Racer X.</p>
<p><strong>minx</strong>: He’ going to be very good.</p>
<p><strong>racer x</strong>: No. He’s going to be the best. The crowd
swarms around Speed’s car.</p>
<p><strong>racer x</strong>: If they don’t destroy him first.</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: Racer residence.</p>
<p><strong>corporate agent</strong>: Good morning, I was hoping to speak
with Speed racer.</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: He’s not interested. He hangs up.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Sprittle!</p>
<p><strong>spr ittle</strong>: It’s true!</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: That’s not for you to say.</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: Speed’s gotta drive for Pops!</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: That’s for Speeed to decide. The phone rings
again. Sprittle grabs it quickly.</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>corporate agent #2</strong>: Is this the Racer residence? He
glances at Mom.</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: Nope. He hangs up. Shrugs.</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: Wrong number.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Speed now sleeps in Rex’s old room. The poster
of Burns is still tacked to the wall above the bed. Mom opens the
door.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Come on, Champ. Rise and shine. Breakfast’s
ready. to the Speed’s hair.seems to remain asleep, still molded pillow
as he tries to push himself up.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: .I’m up, I’m up.</p>
<p><strong>the</strong>: Mom spatulas another short stack of pancakes
from griddle and shovels them like coal into the blazing maw of a
locomotive, dumping them onto the plates of Sprittle and Chim-chim.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: They eat ravenously, trying to secretly
steal food from each other’s plates while Pops reads from the Racing
News.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: “It was a virtuoso display of talent, the
likes of which has not been seen at Thunderhead since Racer the elder
dropped jaws eight. years ago. Now, as we once again, pull our
collective jaws up from the floor, we have to ask, will it be different
this time, or will</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: That’s enough of that, Hon. Pops puts down the
paper and Sparky picks it up.</p>
<p><strong>sparky</strong>: I just can’t believe there wasn’t one
mention of Racer motors in there.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: That’s because the Sponsors run the media,
Sparky. Trixie enters through the back door.</p>
<p><strong>trixie</strong>: Mornin’ everyone. Is Speed up yet? Speed
stumbles in the door.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: .in spirit anyway.</p>
<p><strong>trixie</strong>: Hey superstar, did you see the papers?
They’re all in love with you.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Really? He sits, grabbing the paper.</p>
<p><strong>sparky</strong>: Yeah, but there sure is a lot of speculation
about which team’s going to pick him up</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: .really? Speed starts to read and suddenly
the room begins to rumble, glasses shaking, plates rattling.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: What the–?</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: Earthquake! He and Chim-chim begin wailing
in panic.</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: Quick, under the table! Into the
door-frame!</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: Sprittle calm down!</p>
<p><strong>speeed</strong>: Pops the kitchen’s the most dangerous room
in a house during an earthquake! The whole table shivers and it seems
the hanging ceiling light might shake free when the tremor begins to
subside. Sprittle and Chim-chim, wearing a pot and a metal colander for
protection, look around, expecting something bad to happen. The house
becomes pin-prick quiet when– The doorbell rings.</p>
<p><strong>well dressed man</strong>: Mr. And Mrs. Racer, I hope you
will forgive this imposition. He hands her the beautiful bouquet of
flowers.</p>
<p><strong>well dressed man</strong>: These are Blue-belles from EDEN
Inc. I’m told the will bloom at least three times, each time a different
color. .Mom “ohhhs” her appreciation, while he hands over the box of
cigars.</p>
<p><strong>well dressed man</strong>: And Mr. Racer these are for you,
straight form the Isle of Kamut. Hand-rolled. Premium blend. They glance
at each other, a bit takenaback.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: Uh, thanks but… who are you? He seems to rise
up an inch taller as he introduces himself.</p>
<p><strong>well dressed man</strong>: I am E.P. Arnold Remmingtonton
Esquire, President and Chairman of Remmington Industries and it is my
honor to meet you both. He reaches for Pops’ free hand.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: Mr. Racer, I have been an ardent admirer
of your work for years. I remember the first time I saw the prototype
for the Mach-1, I told everyone that it didn’t belong on a race track,
it belonged in an art museum. Pops chuckles.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: Yeah, she was a beaut.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: No, sir. She was a revelation. He
suddenly smells the pancakes.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: Oh, dear. I interrupted your breakfast.
Is that pancakes, I smell?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Are you hungry, Mr. Remmington?</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: A figure like mine requires constant
attention, Mrs. Racer.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Do you like pancakes?</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: When I was a child we used to say,
“pankuken zin liesben.” Neither of them speak German.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: Pancakes are love.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: Gorgeous, Mrs. Racer. Superb density.
Hints of vanilla. Cinnamon. Absolutely gorgeous.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: I’m glad you like them.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: Like them? I want to-buy your recipe. He
takes out his hand held computer and beings making notes.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: I can give you the recipe, Mr. Remmington.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: Nonsense. Cenestro Foods, a sub-
division of Remmington Industries is planning a new range of home-
cooked meals for travelers and this is just the kind of magic we’re
looking for. I’ll have my attorney draw up the paperwork. Mom looks at
Pops feeling flattered but again a distinct discomfort.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: Now, then. We all know the reason I’m
here is because of you, Speed. I was watching last night and I have to
tell you young man, you gave me goosebumps. I know at once, this was no
mere driver I was watching. This was an artist. Speed’s ears go a bit
red.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Driver’s only as good as the car.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: I appreciate modesty, Speed but I do not
exaggerate when is ay that you are a genius. Watching you reminded me of
why I love racing and I am grateful for that. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: You’re welcome, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: I imagine the phone has been ringing off
the hook.</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: Speed’s not interest in driving for you or
any other sponsor.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: Is this your manager then?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: He’s our youngest. Sprittle.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: Nice to meet you, youngster.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Remmington offers his hand but Sprittle
doesn’t take it.</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: We got out eye on you, Mister.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: Excellent. The first thing I want to
make perfectly clear is that I have no intention whatsoever of trying to
get Speed away from Racer motors. What you have here is what teams spend
years and millions of dollars trying to achieve: chemistry. Car
designer, mechanic and driver all coming together in perfect, harmony. I
wouldn’t dare touch a thing.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Well, excuse me for asking, but what do you
want?</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: To help. I want to make sure you have
access to whatever resources you need to continue doing exactly what you
are doing.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: I assume, Mr. Remmington that you are not
talking about philanthropy. Remmington chuckles.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: I like when my partners have a sense of
humor. And that’s what I’m talking about. A partnership. An alliance
between your amazing family and mine. That’s exactly what Remmington
Industries is to me, a family. Like yours. Just a little bigger. Pops
isn’t exactly buying it.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: No offense, Remmington but Racer Motors runs
as an independent.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: None taken. I completely understand. I
sympathize.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: Strike that– I sympathize. You may think
of R. I. As a huge corporate conglomerate but I will have you know sire,
that I still remember working all night on a Commodore 64 in the
basement of my foster parents’ home. I build R.I. From below the ground
up. So while Remmington Industries may look like a Major Sponsor to you,
it remains in my heart as independent to me as the first day I quit my
job at GloBocom to work for myself. They’re ’re stunned into silence,
while Remmington presses on.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: Now I’ve had this wonderful opportunity
to meet your family. All I am asking is for you to please give me the
chance to introduce you to.mine.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: I’ve never flown so low through the city.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: Special permit. Only six of them are
granted a year.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Sprittle and Chim-chim are gawking at
something else: the vertical pull-out drawer lined with every kind candy
in the world.</p>
<p><strong>flight attendant</strong>: Take whatever you like. He looks
at her for a moment like is in love, then turns back to the drawer where
he and Chim-chim lunge for it, pushing each other back.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: Sprittle!</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: She said we could! Pop growls at him, his
eyes telling them they’d better not take more than one piece.
Hang-dogged heads, they each grab one piece of candy?</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: What do you say?</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: Thank you. She closes the drawer, their
eyes seen through the racks, watching paradise disappear as though a
mirage.</p>
<p><strong>sparky</strong>: Hey, there’s the Grand Prix Coliseum!
Sprittle and Chim-chim rush to Sparky’s window. They can see the entire
track and even from this height it seems enormous. Sprittle turns to
Remmington.</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: My brother’s going to win the Grand Prix
one day. Remmington’s eyes glint.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: No doubt in my mind; young man. Given
the right circumstances, I have no doubt whatsoever.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: This is Gennie. She’s our Talent
Manager. Ask for anything, her job’s to make it come true.</p>
<p><strong>gennie</strong>: Hi, Speed. Welcome to Remmington. He shakes
her hand while she signals to another man who immediately begins
scanning speed with an electronic measuring device.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: To make an informed decision you’ll need
to understand how we take care of our drivers. The tailor finishes
quickly as an electric cart, the kind designed for a group tour pulls
up.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: All abroad.</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: Cool!. They climb on and the driver pulls
into the tramway.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: There are a lot of signs, directional
and advertisements hawking the widely varied Remmington products. The
red lines lead to doors emblazoned with “Restricted Access.” There is a
fair bit of hustle and bustle, like a busy street as golf carts,
seg-ways and motorized scooter zip to and fro. No one walks.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: Remmington Tower is the crown jewel
among the properties that I control. It functions as the corporate
headquarters for he top twelve divisions of our parent corp. One big
industries family. The turn a corner heading for a large set of doors
with the double “R” logo of Remmington Racecars.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: Of all the 143 companies that I control,
none of them is as dear to my heart as the T-180 division. The door
opens as they enter—</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: I’ve always felt that it is impossible
to peer into the window of Tomorrow without a clear view of the
Past.</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: That’s the Crystal Horse with the Apache
Super–Charger!</p>
<p><strong>remington</strong>: Winner of the Grand Prix in ‘69,’ 70 and
’73.</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: No. Wrong. ’72. ’71 was the Vundervopper
with the K-2 twin turbine and ’73 was the Kenobe Motorstar re-built with
a VC ;triple chamber. Remmington considers arguing.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Don’t bother. He’s never wrong. They pass out
of the museum.</p>
<p><strong>remington</strong>: Our vertically integrated plant is the
fastest in the world. From initial carbon bond to finished car in 36
hours. How long does it take at Racer Motors?</p>
<p><strong>sparky</strong>: Several weeks at least. Remmington turns to
Pops.</p>
<p><strong>remington</strong>: This kind of production facility could be
at your disposal, Mr. Racer. The cart motor hums and slides back onto
the tramway.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: This is our operating theater where our
patented Refusion Energy Distributor Network is installed in the turbine
drive. Sparky’s eye light up.</p>
<p><strong>sparky</strong>: Is that an inner-positive transponder?</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: It is indeed. Sparky shoots a look at
Pops.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: We control the only transponder foundry
in the world outside of Mushi Motors in Taiobi. The window suddenly
turns into a mirror.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: Oops. Sorry. Trade Secrets.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: Now, I’ll take you up to the Team
Remmington training facility. The west door opens and the cart glides
out into a new tramway which is not as industrial feeling as the first
one, decorated with a vinyl wainscotting and slightly up- graded lights.
The higher you go in the Remmington Tower, the nicer the halls are
decorated.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: As you know, a T-180 driver’s got to be
in peak physical condition. Across from the gym is a smaller window
where the typical anaerobic test is being conducted on a female driver.
She is running on a treadmill with lost of wires hooked up to her while
several doctors not their approval at the read- outs.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: No expense is spared to make sure that
when our driver’s suit up they are as perfectly tuned as the machines
they are controlling. The next window is a massive centrifuge; a huge
mechanical arm whipping around a small capsule that blasts past the
window.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: The best driver must be able to
withstand over 4-Gs of force in a typical race.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: On the opposite wall is the vibration
chamber. A man is strapped to a chair that is vibrating so hard you
expect his eyeballs to rattle out. The next window is an underwater tank
where a man is driving in a mock up cockpit, executing peddle maneuvers
and gear shifts.</p>
<p><strong>remington</strong>: The will to win is nothing without the
will to prepare and at Team Remmington we prepare our drivers for any
eventuality and every possible condition. The final window is the
weather chamber where a driver is again in a mock cockpit, blue-lipped
and shivering while snow and wind buffet him.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: I hope I didn’t care you, Speed with how
hard we push our team. I just wanted you to see how serious we are
committed to winning.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: I get that.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: Good. But also understand that R.I.
Isn’t all work and no play. The door opens revealing the Drivers’
Club.</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: That’s Cannonball Taylor! Speed urns and
sees the Captain of the Remmington Team.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: Stop the cart. Jack! Jack, come here.
There’s someone I want you to meet. Cannonball saunters over, wearing
his two goiter-sized, diamond-encrusted champion rings.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: Speed Racer allow me to introduce
two-time Grand Prix Winner, five time WRL Champion and future Hall of
Famer, Jack Cannonball Taylor.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Honor to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>canonball</strong>: Caught that Thunderhead replay. Nice
piece of work.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Wow, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>canonball</strong>: There was a rumor you might be
visiting.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: It’s pretty impressive.</p>
<p><strong>canonball</strong>: Only thing I cared about was that wall
over there. He gestures to a special wall fitted with the trophies and
medals won by team Remmington through the years.</p>
<p><strong>canonball</strong>: That’ what sold me. You want to win in
this league, you’re talking to the right guy. Remmington beams.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: Thanks, Jack. Jack nods and the cart
pulls away but not before Jack shoots a backward glance at Speed that
feels like a shank in a prison yard.</p>
<p><strong>sparky</strong>: Long way from Nob Hill, eh?</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: We treat our thoroughbreds the way they
deserve to be treated. He guides them into the room gesturing or
demonstrating all of the amenities.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: There’s full maid service of course with
a personal chef and a masseuse available 24/7. The staff arrives,
wheeling in several racks of clothes: daywear, sportswear, racing
uniforms and stylish evening wear. Gennie holds up one of the suit to
Speed.</p>
<p><strong>gennie</strong>: Should be perfect. Try it on.</p>
<p><strong>trixie</strong>: Mmm hmm!</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: .okay. He heads to the bathroom. Taking Mom
by the elbow, Remmington gestures to the sitting area over-looking
Cosmopolis.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: So Mrs. Racer, what do you think about
my family? Impressed?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: You could say that.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: Good. I want you to understand the
possibilities that exist for your son right now. Pops furrows his
brow.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: What’s wrong Mr. Racer?</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: To be honest, Remmington, I’m feeling more
intimidated than impressed. This kind of company scares me. People like
you have way too much money and when someone has this kind of money,
they start thinking that the rules everyone else is playing by don’t
mean squat to them. Remmington remains skillfully unfazed.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: However, my sons are the most important thing
I’ve ever done in my life, besides marrying my best friend and if Speed
wants us to figure out some kind of… “alliance” then you can bet your
ass we’ll be in business. Speed steps out of the bathroom. His
boyishness has faded away as he suddenly seems very much a man. Gennie
smile approvingly.</p>
<p><strong>trixie</strong>: Hubba hubba. He walks over to the sitting
area.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Oh honey, you looks so handsome.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: Very sharp, Speed. Suits you perfectly.
Regardless of what happens, I want you to have all of it. A gift.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Thanks, Mr. Remmington.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: So, how are you feeling Speed? Speed
isn’t sure. He looks at Trixie and Sparky and then at his parents.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: It’s very… impressive. Remmington smiles.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: You think that maybe there’s something
that could work out here? Everyone waits, staring at him.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: I guess I’d like to think about it, if I
.could. has really Remmington’s a fisherman not sure if the hook been
set.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: This isn’t the kind of offer I go around
making ever day, son.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: I understand that, sir… He looks to Pops then
takes a deep breath as though trying to find his resolve.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: So if I had to give an answer now then, to be
honest–</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: Stop. Right there. You’re right. You
should think about it. I’m sure you’re feeling a bit overwhelmed. You
should take a little time. Think about what you saw and heard here and
we’ll get together early next week. Deal? He reaches his hand out and
Speed takes it with some obvious relief.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Deal.</p>
<p><strong>cruncher</strong>: Ithought we had a deal… When he hears the
voice, he lifts his head and we see a huge man with a body like a
cement-lined safe, sitting behind a desk, lighting a cigar. This
well-dressed fixer is Cruncher Block.</p>
<p><strong>cruncher</strong>: I thought we were friends. He blows a
cloud of smoke and watches it float up to the chandelier which is
jiggling steadily.</p>
<p><strong>cruncher</strong>: Maybe where you come from, this is how you
treat your friends, but ’round here we don’t take to kindly to this kind
of thing, do we fellas? Thug #1 steps in and wails away on him
again.</p>
<p><strong>thug #1</strong>: You hurt our feelings!</p>
<p><strong>cruncher</strong>: Problem is, I like you Katsu. Cruncher
grins, his teeth like stacked dice.</p>
<p><strong>cruncher</strong>: And I got a real soft spot in my heart for
that sister of yours. He begins opening a large package wrapped with
butcher paper. -Inside is a bloody rack of ribs.</p>
<p><strong>cruncher</strong>: Normally in a situation such as this we
would be pouring you a nice comfy pair of cement shoes, but… He stands
and goes to the large glowing fish tank that is behind the desk.</p>
<p><strong>cruncher</strong>: I think I got another solution.. He dips
the bloody meat into the tank filled with piranha. The water foams as
the carnivorous fish shred flesh from bone.</p>
<p><strong>cruncher</strong>: How’re my babies doing? Huh? Hungry? Ready
for seconds? Boys! They grab Katsu and haul him to the fishtank.</p>
<p><strong>katsu</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>thug #2</strong>: Hope dem fishes like Japanese.</p>
<p><strong>katsu</strong>: No, please!</p>
<p><strong>thug #1</strong>: Gonna be hard to drive with skellie hands.
Cruncher takes hold of Katsu’s jaw.</p>
<p><strong>cruncher</strong>: You even think about turning rat and next
time it’s your sister going in there.</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: They begin forcing his hand into the tank when
suddenly red light begins flashing. Everyone freezes. Cruncher grabs the
phone on his desk.</p>
<p><strong>cruncher</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>truck driver</strong>: Someone’s tailing us.</p>
<p><strong>cruncher</strong>: is it him?</p>
<p><strong>door guard</strong>: It could be. Cruncher goes to the
phone.</p>
<p><strong>cruncher</strong>: Can you see him yet?</p>
<p><strong>truck driver</strong>: Here he comes– The car pulls up even
with the cab and the driver feels his gut clench as he recognizes the
infamous car of Racer</p>
<p><strong>truck driver</strong>: Oh God…</p>
<p><strong>cruncher</strong>: Get him! Everyone leaps into action,
shoving Katsu back into a chair. Filling their fists with guns, sliding
open murder holes slots at a variety of heights. Cruncher barks into the
phone.</p>
<p><strong>cruncher</strong>: Crush him!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: But the little black tinted bug flits
away with effortless ease, dancing out in front of the truck.</p>
<p><strong>cruncher</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>truck driver</strong>: He’s out front.</p>
<p><strong>cruncher</strong>: Gotcha. He fires a mini-rocket straight at
the manta-finned car– But with a quick feint left the rocket skims by,
exploding further down the highway. Something flashes on the back car as
hidden tubes iris open and the barrels of several weapons extend
out.</p>
<p><strong>truck driver</strong>: Here he comes! Cruncher fires again,
the red rocket just missing, rending open the tree line with a
fireball.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The little car drops back alongside the
truck and fires, bullets bursting tires and puncturing through the walls
of the truck. The truck lurches as the thugs fire wildly at the black
car. Cruncher tries to site the machine gun but just as he opens fire–
The black car slows, drawing the chasing gun fire until Cruncher shoots
his own tires.</p>
<p><strong>cruncher</strong>: Aww, I thought you fixed that! The black
car fires again, bullets ricocheting inside, puncturing a hole in the
fish tank.</p>
<p><strong>thug #1</strong>: Boss!</p>
<p><strong>cruncher</strong>: My babies! He runs to the fish tank and
tries to stop the water pouring out of the hole. He sticks his finger in
and the fish immediately attack. He shrieks withdrawing his finger.</p>
<p><strong>cruncher</strong>: Vinny put your finger in there! Vinny
doesn’t want to.</p>
<p><strong>cruncher</strong>: Do it!</p>
<p><strong>truck driver</strong>: We can’t take another hit boss!</p>
<p><strong>cruncher</strong>: Pull over but don’t stop.</p>
<p><strong>katsu</strong>: Thank you. You saved my life.</p>
<p><strong>racer x</strong>: I didn’t save anything worth saving unless
you get smart. Real fast. Racer talks without looking at him.</p>
<p><strong>racer x</strong>: You thought you could take on the Cartel.
You can’t. Not without help.</p>
<p><strong>katsu</strong>: I don’t know what’you’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>racer x</strong>: You won the Cortex Invitational and you
weren’t supposed to. You did it to save Okamoto Engineering.</p>
<p><strong>katsu</strong>: It has belonged to my family for five
generations.</p>
<p><strong>racer x</strong>: And now someone else wants it. The only way
you can stop it from happening is to talk to the authorities.</p>
<p><strong>katsu</strong>: There is nothing to talk about.</p>
<p><strong>racer x</strong>: You have been on cruncher Block’s leash
for.so long maybe you forgot how it feels to stand up and be a man. The
only way you’ll ever stop these people is to bring them to justice.</p>
<p><strong>katsu</strong>: Justice/ That’s a commodity I don’t waste
money on. Racer X immediately pulls his car over.</p>
<p><strong>racer x</strong>: Get out. Wearing his smirk like a cheap
suit, Katsu gets out.</p>
<p><strong>katsu</strong>: I’ll see you at Fuji.</p>
<p><strong>racer x</strong>: You won’t finish. When you lose, if you can
still dial a phone, call this number. He hands him a card. The card
reads; CHIEF INSPECTOR</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Sprittle is working hard on a test when he
hears the behind him whisper.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Hey monkey-lover, show me your test or I’ll
kick your ass after school.</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: Sorry. Cheaters never prosper. The kid to
the left chimes in.</p>
<p><strong>malcom</strong>: Spriiiitle, when Chim-chim’s bad, do you
spank the monkey?</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: No, your mother does it for me. Malcom
almost swallows his tongue as several other kids snicker..</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: All right! Malcom! Danny! Sprittle! To the
Principal’s office. March! There is a chorus of, “I didn’t do it, awwww,
not fair.”</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Now!</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Looks like someone’s in trouble again.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Want to talk about it? Sprittle shakes his
head.</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: K-W Integral 4-door with twin-cam
turbine…C-foster-K 1200, modified split-rail and supershocks…</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Was it that Stanton kid again? Did he say
something? If you want to kick his butt–? He shakes his head again.</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: .it doesn’t seem fair that I get in
trouble, when they always start it.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: It’s not fair. But that’s what bullies do.
They make the world unfair.</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: That sucks.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Yes, it does.</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: What can I do about it?</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: You ignore ’em when you can, fight ’em when
you can’t.</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: Those choices suck too.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Yeah, but just try to keep one thing in
mind.</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Bullies come and go but a family can torture
you forever. Chim-chim gives Sprittle a wet-willy.</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: Heeeeeey! Speed laughs as Chim-chim howls
and then puts his arm around Sprittle.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: But no joke, you just say the word, little
brother and we got your back, right Chim-chim? Chim-chim grunts.</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: Thanks guys.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: The new GRX has a super charged
inner-positive transporter and will be capable of speeds in excess off
800 kilometers an hour. Mushi nods.</p>
<p><strong>mushi</strong>: If such a car were to win the Grand Prix this
year, one would expect the demand for transponders to increase
dramatically.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: One would expect.</p>
<p><strong>mushi</strong>: And if a single company gained control of all
the transponder foundries in the world, one might expect that company to
do very well for itself.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: You know what I want and I know that for
the last few years you have been trying to buy out your main rival
Tetsua Okamoto. The question is, can we make a deal? The car rotates,
rising up on its mechanical arm, a cybernetic giant, exercising its
might.</p>
<p><strong>mushi</strong>: Deliver Okamoto at that price and the Taiobi
Transponder foundry is yours.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: Done. Remington smiles as they shake
hands.</p>
<p><strong>car-</strong>: watching the sinking sun tye-dye the sky
behind the scape of freeways.</p>
<p><strong>trixie</strong>: You’re really considering signing with
Remmington.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: I just said it was tempting.</p>
<p><strong>trixie</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Well, they got a really good team..
Cannonball Taylor, Markie Manifold. They win a lot of Majors.</p>
<p><strong>trixie</strong>: Since when did winning become so
important?</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: It is important. You gotta win if you want to
keep driving and that’s what I want to do. It’s the only thing I really
know how to do. When I’m driving, I feel like that’s the only time my
life makes sense. She moves closer to him.</p>
<p><strong>trixie</strong>: You mean, this doesn’t make sense to
you?</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Okay, besides being with you.</p>
<p><strong>trixie</strong>: So you like being with me?</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: You know I do.</p>
<p><strong>trixie</strong>: Sometimes I do, sometimes I’m not so
sure.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>trixie</strong>: Sometimes around your family, you seem
distant, not like this and I wonder why.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Come on, you know how I’ve felt about you
since I was ten years old.</p>
<p><strong>trixie</strong>: I guess so, I just wish you weren’t so shy
about it.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: What do you want me to do? Kiss you in front
of everyone at the end of a big race?</p>
<p><strong>trixie</strong>: Would that be so terrible?</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: I don’t know. Maybe we should practice
first.</p>
<p><strong>trixie</strong>: Maybe we should. They start to kiss when
they hear a muted voice.</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: Oh God! I’m gonna hurl! Huuuurrrl!</p>
<p><strong>trixie</strong>: Sprittle?</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Speed jumps out of the car.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: He did not! He throws open the trunk,
revealing Sprittle and Chim-chim who shrieks.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Sprittle!</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: It wasn’t my idea!</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Oh no?</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: It was his! He points at Chim-chim who
shakes his head wildly, pointing back at Sprittle.</p>
<p><strong>trixie</strong>: Wait till we tell Pops.</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: No! Don’t do that! We’re sorry. We
couldn’t sleep. We just wanted to hang out. We didn’t know you were
going to In-spew-ration Point. By the way, Cootie-shots. Sprittle and
Chim-chim immediately cover one shoulder giving themselves a
cootie-shot.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: I’m taking you home.</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: Wait, wait, wait– Speed slams•the trunk
shut so we hear Sprittle voice muffled</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: Can we stop for ice cream first?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: He is carrying a brown paper sack.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: Morning, Speed.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Pops.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: So, today’s the big day. Speed nods. Pops puts
down his tools.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: I know this is a tremendous opportunity for
you.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: It could be for you too.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: Could be, could be. But, regardless, this is
really all about you. It’ your decision and I want you to know, no
matter what you decide, I’m behind you.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Thanks, Pops. The room begins to shake.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: I think your ride’s here.</p>
<p><strong>like</strong>: Speed stares out the window, chewing on his
decision a dog worrying a bone.</p>
<p><strong>is</strong>: Gennie greets Speed as he debarks from the
plane. He carrying his brown sack.</p>
<p><strong>gennie</strong>: Speed, so nice to see you again. Her,eyes
and the softness of her touch elevate flirting to something that is
equal parts art and science.</p>
<p><strong>gennie</strong>: Mr. Remmington is so excited about this
meeting. He hasn’t talked about anything else all week. Speed sighs.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: Speed! Gennie leaves speed, returning to
the elevator, as Remmington crosses to him. He hugs him</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: Welcome back! Come. Sit. Sit.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: In the center of the room is a small
cluster of extremely comfortable chairs in which they sit. Above them a
multifaceted skylight glitters like a cut gem under the streaming rays
of sunlight. In the center of the sky light is the R.I. Logo casting a
great shadow on the floor.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: Can I get you something to drink? Water?
Bubbly? A shot of rye? Speed smiles sheepishly.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: No… I’m okay.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: So, I can see you have given some
serious thought to this thing.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: I have, yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: Good. That means that you understand
that we are talking about not just your future, but your family’s
future.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: .my family means a lot to me.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: I know. I can tell. That’s why this is
so important. Because you can help them. All you have to say is yes.
That is all I need to hear and I can make so many things happen for you,
and your family. Are you ready for that? Are you ready to say yes,
Speed?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: A cleaning man is rising up on a cherry
picker with a cart full of cleaning supplies.</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: Uh-oh. He looks back at their mess.</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: jig’s up. A moment later the door opens
and the cleaning man enters..</p>
<p><strong>cleaning man</strong>: Holy cooly: He grabs for his
radio.</p>
<p><strong>cleaning man</strong>: Hey, this is Marvin down at the
landing pad. I think we got mice again. As he talks, two shadows slip
quietly out the door behind him.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: This isn’t an easy decision for me,
Mr. Remmington. For my family, racing is everything. We eat, drink,
think and breathe racing. There is nothing more perfect than a picnic at
Thunderhead. I mean, I was taught to drive before I could walk. But when
my brother died, all that went away. I can’t tell you how painful that
was. It nearly killed all of us. Especially Pops. He didn’t set foot in
his shop for over a year. As the memory comes to life, we see the images
in flashback.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: But one night when I was still pretty young.
I couldn’t sleep and I went into the living room and there was Pops, in
his beat up robe, watching some old race recordings. The blue tv light
of Speed’s memory fills his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: So I sat with him watching of Ben Burns
coming round the last turn of he ’43 Prix and all of a sudden Pops
started screaming, and then I started screaming, and as Burns and Dugazi
duked it out, heading for the finish, we were cheering our heads off and
the second the black and white came down, we looked at each other and
right there we realized the naked truth; racing is in our blood.
Flashback ends.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: But for Pops, it isn’t just a sport. It’s way
more important than that. It’s like a religion and in our house, the
Major Sponsors are kinda like the devil. The coldness in Remmington’s
eyes belies his smile.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: I don’t mean to offend you sir and I do
appreciate your offer, it’s just, I guess I understand his -point of
view and after all we’ve been through, I don’t think this kind of deal
is for me. Remmington chuckles.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: You poor, naive, chump. He chuckles
again.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: I’m going to pretend I didn’t hear that
load of sickening schmaltz and I am going to give you a bit of an
education. At the end of it if you’re smart, you’ll thank me and hen
you’ll sign that contract.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: Look. There is the true spirit of the
golden age of racing. Benjamin Braddack, Diamond Dave Tweksbury,
Reginald White, Oliver Potter, and George Wheeler. The five most
powerful men in the world at the turn of the last century. As he talks
we flash back to jittery old footage and photographs of the golden
era.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: For all intensive purposes they created
the modern automotive industry. But the true stroke of their genius was
the invention of the WRL, the world’s first racing league. Remmington
leads Speed past several personal mementos including the first motor of
his first car, the first milk bottle from victory lane,.a black and
white from an important race. In front of an enlarged picture of Ben
Burns from the infamous ’43 Prix is a twisted and scorched piece of
metal set on a pedestal like a gorgeous piece of art.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: Interesting that you and your father
were so moved by the ’43 Prix. One of the great finishes in the history
of racing, right? Everyone remembers Burns and Dugazi slugging it out,
but who remembers Carl Potts? Driving a rebuilt Wittigan for Iodyne .
Industries, Potts spun out in the second lap and went down as a DNF. A
forgettable and pathetic finish. So bad, that afterwards Iodyne stock
dropped six points. Again we see the history told in flashback.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: Meanwhile, Ben Burns sat guzzling cold
fresh milk in victory lane, a thousand cameras taking his picture,
Sirrus Aeronautics saw almost a twelve point gain which immediately
block Penninsula Power Cell from being able to afford the price of a
complete take-over. This put Joel Goldman, the CEO of Iodyne Inc. in the
exact position he wanted to be in. By first buying controlling interest
in his own company at a devalued price, he then brokered a merger with
Sirrus that immediately sent Iodyne into the gains record book– the only
record book that matters. Look out that window, there isn’t a single
plane or helicopter or K- Harrier that isn’t powered by Iodyne fuel
cells. That’s what racing is about. It has nothing to do with cars, or
drivers. All that matters is power and the unassailable might of money.
His greed is as tangible as any drug.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: His radio buzzes “perps last seen
tramway four, driving a maintenance cart.” The doors start to close when
Sprittle and Chim-chim jump out and sneak inside.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: Do you understand? Burns knew he was
going to win. It was already decided. A week before the Prix, Goldman
and Sirrus met with several other major players at the Carlyle Hotel.
They met there as they had for years, just as their fathers had met, and
as their sons and heirs will still meet. They met to negotiate the
finish order of the Grand Prix. No race is more important and no race is
more controlled. That year Goldman was supposed to win, but he knew if
he sold his win to Sirrus, whatever that win might be worth, was nothing
compared to what could be gained. He turns back to the twisted piece of
crash metal.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: That’s why I paid three million dollars
for this burnt and twisted piece of metal. Because it reminds me of what
really matters. This is the true heart of racing boy! This is my
religion! Speed is aghast.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: You don’t know how many times I have
seen that same cow-eyed “say it isn’t so” look of disbelief. Every
bumpkin who comes in from the sticks looks exactly like you do now. I
won’t bother proving it to you.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: If you walk away from me, if you walk
out of.this deal, you’ll know how true it is soon enough. So, last
chance. What’s it going to be, Speed? Your father’s little fantasy
bubble? Or are you going to join the rest of us adults, here in
reality?</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: What’s this? He looks and sees the shoes
and suit.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: If that’s your idea of racing, you can keep
it.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: Listen to me and listen good kid,
because I’m going to give you one more history lesson. You’re going to
go to Fuji– In quick, collage cuts we see –</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: But you won’t win. You won’t place. More
collage cuts–</p>
<p><strong>fuji announcer</strong>: Speed Racer’s making his move,
gunning for the lead–</p>
<p><strong>gray ghost</strong>: We got ourselves a real race here! The
two cars start dancing around each other; like two boxers sizing each
other up.</p>
<p><strong>gray ghost</strong>: Here we go, here we go. Wham. Ghost
throws the first punch which Speed tries to slip but, the Ghost
anticipates his move and slams Speed hard.</p>
<p><strong>gray ghost</strong>: Come on! Show me something! Show me what
you got! Speed ducks down the bank, working each wheel into a hyper
drift, reversing their position– Locking the Ghost up and sending both
cars spinning.</p>
<p><strong>gray ghost</strong>: Ohhhh yeah! Yeeeeeahhhhh!</p>
<p><strong>fuji announcer</strong>: The Gray Ghost unloads a round-
house, Speed counters, smashing, banging, bumping-</p>
<p><strong>gray ghost</strong>: Here I come, kid! Watch out. Here I am!
Nope–I’m over here! Wham! Wham! Speed tries to counter punch and the
Ghost slips under.</p>
<p><strong>gray ghost</strong>: You can’t.touch me! I’m here! I’m gone!
Speed is thrown back into the pack of cars that quickly swallow him up
where he is– Crunched into the wall by the Zokeo Communications car,
pinned until– Racer X slams into the Zokeo car, freeing Speed but
causing several cars tp swerve wildly at which point– The Three Roses
car torpedoes Katsu’s car– Bursting into a blizzard of metal snowflakes
while–</p>
<p><strong>remmington driver</strong>: I guarantee you right now, you
won’t even finish the race.</p>
<p><strong>sparky</strong>: Speed, get out of there!</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: I can’t! I can’t move! The two cars head
toward the final jump, locked in some strange embrace– They lunge
awkwardly, crashing on top of one another as– Inside Speed’s car, his
face plate seals and the kwiksave- foam explodes, swallowing him, as the
car tumbles– Disintegrating into a cloud of smoke and glittering
debris.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: Soon after that there will be litigation
against some of your father’s designs.</p>
<p><strong>dour face</strong>: Are you Pops Racer of Racer Motors-</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: Yeah, but I’m still on vacation-</p>
<p><strong>dour face</strong>: You are hereby served a summons.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>dour face</strong>: You are being sued for IP infringement by
Janus Automakers.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: That’s ridiculous!</p>
<p><strong>dour face</strong>: That’s for a jury to decide.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: The legitimacy of the lawsuits won’t
matter. They will be enough to discredit his company. Whatever contracts
he has, he’ll lose. Within a year he will be filing for bankruptcy.
After that, you and the rest of your pathetic family will be history.
The threat hangs in the air like a loaded gun between them.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Pops was right. You are the devil. The
elevator suddenly opens with the security goon carrying Sprittle and
Chim-chim by the scruff of their necks.</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: Speed!</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Sprittle?</p>
<p><strong>security goon</strong>: Mr. Remmington I caught these two
snooping in a restricted area.</p>
<p><strong>remmington driver</strong>: Get this Racer trash out of my
building.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: I’ll see you at Fuji. Speed turns and heads
for the elevator.</p>
<p><strong>remmington driver</strong>: Yes and then you’ll realize that
you just made the biggest mistake of your life!</p>
<p><strong>tnt. racer kitchen -morning</strong>: Close up on The Racing
News that Sparky is reading from. The main headline: ANOTHER DIRTY
RACER?</p>
<p><strong>sparky</strong>: “. .controversy surrounds Racer Motors now
embroiled in IP litigation and while evidence remains inconclusive
whether or not Speed used an illegal device, the Fuji Helexicon seems
destined to become another mark of shame added to the notorious Racer
family legacy, a legacy that has forever tainted the integrity of this
beloved sport.”</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Sparky. That’s enough.</p>
<p><strong>sparky</strong>: Sorry ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: I’m going to send that guy some Chim-chim
cookies. Chim-chim guffaws.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: You’ll do no such thing.</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: We gotta do something, Pops. Speed steps
into the doorway.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: This is exactly what he said would happen if
I didn’t drive for him.</p>
<p><strong>sparky</strong>: You mean Remmington?</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: He said it’d get worse and worse and by the
end of the year you’d be filing for bankruptcy, Pops.</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: Okay, he’s definitely gettin’ some monkey
cookies.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Sprittle!</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: He was just trying to scare you, son. They
tried the same thing with Rex. If it’s a fight they want, it’s a fight
they’ll get.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: How? What can we do? How can we fight this?
He tosses the newspaper.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: The truth will come out.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: The truth? Don’t be naive, Pops. He
leaves.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Speed? Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: .I don’t know. She comes in and sits beside
him, putting her arm around him.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: It’ll be okay. We’ll get through it.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: I don’t know, mom. I might have really messed
things up.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: By not joining Remmington.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Don’t be silly. You’d have never been happy
driving for that terrible man.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: But maybe racing isn’t about being happy.
Maybe Remmington’s right and it’s all about business and anyone who
doesn’t understand that is just a chump.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Now you listen to me, young man. What you do
behind the wheel of a racecar has nothing to do with business. Before
you could even talk, you were making noises that sounded like a car
engine. We used to tell people you were speaking car-ese. We used to try
to take you to the park but you never wanted to get out of the car.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: .I loved that old wagon.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: And do you remember the time Rex took you out
to Thunderhead and let you drive– Speed smiles.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: And I turned it over.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: My heart still pounds just thinking about
it.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Rex told me the only reason we survived was
because I was wearing red socks.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: I thought your father was going to have a
stroke when you walked in the door with that crazy smile.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: I don’t think I ever saw you as happy as you
were telling anybody who asked, how you lost your two front teeth in
your first crash.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Speed, when I watch you do some of the things
you do, I feel like I’m watching someone paint or play music. When I go
to the races, I go to watch you make art and it’s beautiful and
inspiring and everything that art should be, even though there are times
when I have to close my eyes. But then there are other times, when you
just take my breath away and it’s at those moments, when I feel your
father’s chest swell and I know he’s smiling, trying to pretend he
doesn’t have tears in his eyes, I just go to pieces.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Because I am so impossibly proud to be your
mother. And even though your father doesn’t say it, he is too. She puts
her arms around him.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Don’t worry. We’ll figure this out. We just
have to stick together. Something good will happen. You’ll see. Ding
dong. The front doorbell chimes.</p>
<p><strong>run for your lives!</strong>: Popsstorms into the room.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: What are you two squawking about? They dive
behind the couch but peek out as Pops heads for the door.</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: Pops, whatever you do, don’t open the
door!</p>
<p><strong>racer x</strong>: This is a bad idea.</p>
<p><strong>inspector detector</strong>: If it was any other driver,
you’d be here. Popsopens the door and Racer X sets his jaw.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: Inspector Detector?</p>
<p><strong>inspector detector</strong>: Good morning, Mr.. Racer. I know
it’s been a long time–</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: He extends his hand and Pop shakes
it.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: Ten years.</p>
<p><strong>inspector detector</strong>: Yes. I’m sorry for this
intrusion, but I was hoping to have a word with you and Speed. Pops eyes
the masked racer.</p>
<p><strong>inspector detector</strong>: It’s important.</p>
<p><strong>inspector detector</strong>: We’ve been after Remmington for
years for dozens of capital corporate crimes including WRL fixing but we
haven’t had the evidence we need to convict him. Until now. Sprittle and
Chim-chim peek up from behind the couch as Mom offers the masked racer a
cup of coffee.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Here you are, Mr. X. Sprittle points at Racer
X.</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: What’s he doing here?</p>
<p><strong>inspector detector</strong>: Racer X works closely with our
WRL corporate crimes division, helping us recruit drivers like you,
Speed. Most of the media, which you are now seeing is controlled by the
Major Sponsors and they have done their best to paint him as a menace to
the sport. The truth is he’s our most valuable weapon against these
villains.</p>
<p><strong>speeed</strong>: Why does he always wear that mask?</p>
<p><strong>inspector detector</strong>: If any of, you actually knew his
identity, you would become targets for his enemies which include some of
the most vicious Fixers in the world. Gulp. They both sink back down
behind the couch.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: What do you want with me?</p>
<p><strong>inspector detector</strong>: You’re familiar with the driver
Katsu Okamoto?</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>inspector detector</strong>: For years he has been contracted
by a Fixer named Cruncher Block who we know works for Remmington.
Recently, Katsu has been forced to lose races that have led to a droop
in the stock price of Okamoto Engineering. We believe this is a part of
a corporate strategy to allow Mushi motors to buy control of Okamoto.
Katsu doesn’t want this to happen and he began resisting, thinking.that
he could do it on his own. After Fuji, he realized he needed help.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: ,Why help him?</p>
<p><strong>inspector detector</strong>: Because he has a file with
enough information to connect Block to Remmington which could put both
of them behind bars for the rest of their lives. The problem is, he
won’t give us the file unless we help him stop the take over of his
family’s company.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>inspector detector</strong>: There is an up-coming race that
Katsu believes if he can win, it will catapult Okamoto Engineering back
into the spotlight and double the cost of the buy out which should kill
it.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: But there aren’t any more races left except
for the Grand Prix and we both failed to qualify. Inspector takes a big
breath.</p>
<p><strong>inspector detector</strong>: There aren’t any track races.
This is a cross-country rally.</p>
<p><strong>sparky</strong>: You mean The Crucible?</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>inspector detector</strong>: I know it seems cruel of me to
ask, but Katsu made it clear that he had to have Speed an X on his team
or there would be no deal.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: Absolutely out of the question.</p>
<p><strong>inspector detector</strong>: You’ll have the support of the
entire C.I.B–</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: No! Rally racing is a back alley sport full of
jackals, head- hunters and thugs! I’m sorry, Inspector but I lost one
son to that death-trap. I won’t lose another.</p>
<p><strong>inspector detector</strong>: I understand. If you change
your</p>
<p><strong>mind–</strong>: He starts to take out his card.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: Keep your card, Chief Inspector.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Speed looks at Pops, then realizes that
Racer X is staring straight at him.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: And the way he was looking at me, I don’t
know…I just gotta do something.</p>
<p><strong>trixie</strong>: But Pops will never let you go.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: He won’t if I ask him.</p>
<p><strong>trixie</strong>: Speed Racer what are you thinking?</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: You weren’t in Remmington’s office, Trix. You
don’t know what it was like. It felt as though he had his hand inside my
chest and he was trying to crush everything in my life that mattered to
me.</p>
<p><strong>trixie</strong>: I hate him. I’m picturing his heart clogging
with cholesterol right now.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: No joke, Trix. If you could have been in that
room, you’d want to do anything you could to take this guy down. She
looks straight into his eyes and he doesn’t have to say anything
else.</p>
<p><strong>trixie</strong>: All right. Let’s do it. You’re going to need
an alibi. We’ll say we’re going skiing.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: What? No way!</p>
<p><strong>trixie</strong>: You’re going to need my help. Casa Cristo is
a rally. I can spot from a ’copter.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Trixie, this isn’t a game. These people play
rough.</p>
<p><strong>trixie</strong>: I know. That’s why I’m coming with you. And
if you even try to argue with me, I’ll tell Pops right now and he won’t
let you out of his sight.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: You would, wouldn’t you? He looks into her
eyes and knows the answer.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Well…I guess we’re going skiing. She
smiles.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: As I’m sure you’re aware, the Okamoto
stock fell another four points yesterday. In the next few days it will
hit bottom and they will have to sell. The car roars through its
elliptical path like a circling electron binding the two tycoons
together.</p>
<p><strong>mushi</strong>: This could be a most profitable year for
Remmington. Remmington can’t hide the glow.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: Mushi won’t do too badly either. Mushi
nods. Cannonball circles, everything in apparent harmony until Gennie
leans in and whispers.</p>
<p><strong>gennie.</strong>: I know this is terrible timing sir, but
I’ve just received confirmation of several last minute entries to the
Casa Cristo</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>gennie</strong>: You’re not going to like it.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: We’re just minutes away from the start of
the 82nd annual Casa Cristo Classic, the grand dame of cross-country,
the second oldest rally race in the world, spanning two continents,
three climate changes and five thousand kilometers of the most winding
and treacherous roads ever raced. Heturns to his colleague.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: With me again is five time Casa Cristo
champion, Johnny “Goodboy” Jones.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Always great to be here. Such a beautiful
city.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: One of the most romantic cities in the
world.</p>
<p><strong>bellman</strong>: Is there anything else I can do for you,
sir?</p>
<p><strong>cruncher</strong>: Yeah …I wanna send someone a present.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Safety has been the primary concern for
Casa Cristo officials, especially the last few years.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: That’s right Bob. There were a number of
fatalities several years ago. It really had a bad reputation for a
while.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Fans started calling it “The
Crucible.”</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Most of the T-180 drivers wouldn’t come near
it.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: But you look today, we’ve got some major
names like Millie “the mouse” Manno, Snake Oiler and Katsu Okamoto as
well as the young rising star Speed Racer. Not to mention, the shadow
that seems to hang over every major race these days, the masked racer
that some fans call the Harbinger of Boom. What’s your take on Racer
X?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Obviously he is an extremely talented and
disciplined driver.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: But is he a head hunter?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I think he drives like he’is not always
interested in winning.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Nuff’ said.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: But remember Colton, these are standard road
cars, not T-180s. I know a lot of T-180 drivers who I raced against who
expected to win but found out racing a few laps on a track is a totally
different animal than a cross-country rally.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: The marathon as opposed to the
sprint?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Exactly. This isn’t just about going fast.
It’s about endurance. More than anything, winning Casa Cristo is a test
of will.</p>
<p><strong>inspector detector</strong>: Speed, I want you to understand
how much the C.I.B. appreciates your help on this.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: I’m not doing this to help C.I.B. I don’t
know anything about corporate crimes and honestly, if I did, it wouldn’t
really matter.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: I’m doing this because someone is trying to
hurt my family and I’m going to do everything I can to hurt him back.
The masked racer is unable to mask his smile.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: The reason.T-180 drivers have always come
to Casa Cristo is because the winner is automatically offered an
invitation to the Grand Prix next week. A hold over from the days when
rally racing was far more popular then track racing.</p>
<p><strong>johnny.</strong>: Gosh how things have changed.</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: He says it’s for Horuko, from an
admirer. Katsu looks at the ribboned box as the guard runs his metal
detector over it.</p>
<p><strong>horuko</strong>: You see how we have to live? He ignores her,
turning away as she starts to open it. She screams. Inside the goldfish
bowl the piranha shreds a piece of meat that could be a finger,
staining-the water red.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: To compete in this race, you really have to
have a killer instinct. Any sign of weakness or timidness is like blood
in the water and you’ll see how fast this race turns into a feeding
frenzy.</p>
<p><strong>racer x</strong>: We’re going to need some insurance for this
race. Minx clicks away at a keyboard while a digital Mach 5 rotates on a
screen.</p>
<p><strong>racer x</strong>: Minx builds my cars.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Nice to meet ya. She purrs in response. Racer
X nods and she uses the computer to illustrate her modifications.</p>
<p><strong>minx</strong>: Their cars will probably be equipped with
secret weapons so we have modified your car to try to counter their
attacks. The “A” button will operate your normal jump-jacks. The Mach 5
flips over on the screen highlighting the newly installed
jump-jacks.</p>
<p><strong>minx</strong>: “B” will seal your cockpit, which we’ve
fortified with a bulletproof polymer. Gun-bots fire digital bullets at
the Mach 5 which ricochet off the blueprint glass.</p>
<p><strong>minx</strong>: “C” will inflate an emergency hexadyno spare
after any blowout. Avatar vandals slash the Mach 5’s tires, which
explode then re-inflate.</p>
<p><strong>minx</strong>: “D” will activate these zircon tipped saw
blades that will cut through anything that tries to attach itself to
you. The Mach 5 opens like a Swiss army knife.</p>
<p><strong>minx</strong>: “E” will project the tire crampons. The image
zooms in on the newly equipped cat-claw tires.</p>
<p><strong>minx</strong>: And “F” will launch a remote control homing
bird that is capable of transmitting QTVR footage anywhere you are. A
final click demonstrates the capabilities of the Mach 5’s homing
bird.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Every race fan has heard the rumors of
spearhooks, tire shanks and battery boosters.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: The league has done a tremendous job to
clean rally racing up. While it’s true there have been a few bad apples,
on the’whole most teams stay within league rules. He winks into the
camera.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Or at least try not to get caught.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: Sprittle! Faster than a blink Sprittle grabs
the remote and changes the channel to “Unser Charly,” a German sitcom
starring a monkey.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: Just watching a little TV, Pops. Pops
looks at the TV suspiciously, then back at his son.</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: It’s his favorite show.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: It’s in German!</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: Not the monkey parts. chim-chim
smiles.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: Oh no you don’t. You are not watching that
race. Out you go. Outside. Get some exercise. You’re too pale.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: The moment the Queen of Casa Cristo sees
the sun, she’ll signal the start of the race.</p>
<p><strong>tnt. hotel suite</strong>: They speak in Japanese.</p>
<p><strong>horuko</strong>: This is wrong.what you are trying to do.</p>
<p><strong>katsu</strong>: I have no choice. Their price is an insult to
four generations of our family.</p>
<p><strong>horuko</strong>: And if you die? Will then the price be high
enough?</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: I understand it now, Trix. I know why he left
us. She looks at him.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: He was trying to change this rotten business
and they killed him for it.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: This is supposed to be my race! I’m supposed
to win! I got the green light! They. promised I’d get to go to the Grand
Prix! For eight years I’ve played by the rules! This is supposed to be
my race!</p>
<p><strong>cruncher</strong>: Enough! I can’t stand the whining!</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: Like a baby needing its diaper changed. Snake
works his jaw looking for the right comeback.</p>
<p><strong>cruncher</strong>: It’s simple. We have a team of wild cards.
The problem is these wild cards are better drivers than you.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Like hell they are!</p>
<p><strong>cruncher</strong>: Prove it. Take out Katsu. The other two
will quit.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Snake seethes.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: You just watch me. Come on! He and his boys
storm out, slamming the door behind them.</p>
<p><strong>trixie</strong>: Katsu, HydroCell’s coming up on• your left.
The HydroCell cars jostle their way towards Katsu, Speed and Racer
X.</p>
<p><strong>racer x</strong>: I got him.</p>
<p><strong>katsu</strong>: It is such an extraordinary honor to have
such talent on my team.</p>
<p><strong>racer x</strong>: Let’s skip the niceties and cut to the
chase. Katsuarches an eyebrow.</p>
<p><strong>racer x</strong>: The only reason we’re here is because you
needed two outsiders and because the Chief Inspector believes you’ll
turn over your. file on Remmington and Block. Racer X eyes him.</p>
<p><strong>racer x</strong>: I don’t believe it. I don’t trust anyone
who needs this kind of deal before they’ll bring a criminal to justice.
The accusation hangs in the air.</p>
<p><strong>racer x</strong>: But I’m willing to take a chance that
you’ll prove me wrong.</p>
<p><strong>katsu</strong>: You won’t regret your decision.</p>
<p><strong>racer x</strong>: We’ll see. Until then you have my word that
I will do everything.I can to make sure you checker at Bartimaeus. Katsu
smiles.</p>
<p><strong>knocking</strong>: Racer X smashes into one of the HydroCell
team, him into a series of billboards. Katsu again smiles.</p>
<p><strong>katsu</strong>: Arrigato, X. Arrigato.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: If they’re so desperate, why not just use
some kind of sniper? There’s a million places someone could hide if they
were really trying to kill you.</p>
<p><strong>racer x</strong>: Any obvious crime would allow the Chief
Inspector to shut the race down. That kind of scrutiny would only hurt
the business. They’ll do as much as they can to make it appear legit.
Speed nods.</p>
<p><strong>racer x</strong>: The real problem we’ll have is after the:
first leg. Corteges is going to be extremely dangerous. Take my advice,
keep your family away from Cortega. Speed again looks out at Moruko on
the balcony.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: They’re out of the city and heading into
the Zunubian Desert.</p>
<p><strong>trixie</strong>: Speed, jump!</p>
<p><strong>racer x</strong>: He’s not alone.</p>
<p><strong>racer x</strong>: This surprises me.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>racer x</strong>: Tyrus is a good man. I wouldn’t expect him
to turn head-hunter. They aren’t pulling any punches.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Things have started heating up, as the
cars head out across the desert flats.</p>
<p><strong>racer x</strong>: Lead him–</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Here ya go! Speed leads an attack straight
into Racer X’s counter.</p>
<p><strong>racer x</strong>: Wing left.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Flying in!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: He jumps one car and blocks the attack
on X. As their cars merge in.and out from one another, something seems
perfectly clear to Speed– He is back at Thunderhead with the ghost of
his brother, dancing around each other until–</p>
<p><strong>trixie</strong>: Speed! Wham! Billy slams up against him–
Throwing a lever, a grappler locks on to the Mach 5.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: He’s got me! I’m locked up! Another lever is
pumped like a tire pump and a sheaved blade begins stabbing at Speed’s
tires. Racer X watches unable to leave Katsu unprotected. Speed hits the
D button and the zircon saw blades start gliding through the
grappler.</p>
<p><strong>racer x</strong>: Get out of there! -</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: I’m trying! The knife slashes the tire which
explodes just as the grappler is cut– Speed flips away free, hitting the
“C” button causing a new tire to inflate while he’s upside down– Landing
on a new tire, without missing a beat. Tyrus rushes into the opening,
but this time it’s Katsue who works a hidden lever and– A Katana-like
blade flashes, a samurai slash across the front tire– Bowing it out,
flipping the entire car, which tumbles back straight at Speed, forcing
him to try a split-jack</p>
<p><strong>jump–</strong>: Firing only the rear jump-jacks, launching
the back end of the car while–</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The front end of the Mach 5 clips
against the Atomic Injectibles car– Sending Speed flipping end over end
but landing with strangely beautiful grace.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Oh my god! Did I just see that!?</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: A rear single set jump into a forward
flip!</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I know he blew up at Fugi, but this kid is
flat out magic!</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: I’ve got to go into town for some parts. I’ll
be back for lunch.</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: Sure thing Pops. Pops looks at them,
shakes his head and walks off.</p>
<p><strong>him</strong>: Sprittle slowly lowers his tanning goggles to
watch go.</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: Let’s go! They drop their mirrors and bolt
for the house.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: Honey, I can’t find my wallet—- Pops enters
the room expecting to find Mom but catches them red-handed.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: Sprittle! He sees the race on tv.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: You two are in–</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: Wait! Pops, before you get mad at us–Look!
Sprittle points at the tv eyes wide.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: I’m not falling for that–</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: It’s Speed!</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: Speed’s skiing.</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: Then who’s driving the Mach 5? Pops turns
and indeed, there’s the Mach 5 barrelling across the red baked earth of
Zunubia.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: Oh no.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: We’re nearing the end of the first leg of
the Casa Cristo as Snake Oiler, lead driver for the HydroCell team,
roars through the streets of Cortega, heading for the finish.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: The HydroCell team jumped on the lead
early and would not give it up.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: They made excellent time. Okamoto is still a
couple of minutes behind them.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: They have their work cut out for them
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>katsu</strong>: If we drive tomorrow like we drove today we
will lose! He points at the masked racer.</p>
<p><strong>katsu</strong>: You will get nothing! All of this will be
meaningless!</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Relax. Snake’s weak on turns. We’ll catch him
in the mountains.</p>
<p><strong>katsu</strong>: We might if you stop showing off.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Hey, all I was doing was saving your ass.
Katsu raises a fist, but Racer X catches it.</p>
<p><strong>racer x</strong>: Don’t fall apart yet. There’s still a lot
of race to run. Katsu jerks free of Racer X and storms towards the door
immediately enveloped by his security team. Speed looks at Racer X as
though he can suddenly see through the mask.</p>
<p><strong>racer x</strong>: A C.I.B. Man will be posted outside your
door. We got their attention today. You and Trixie should be very
careful tonight. Speed nods as Racer X heads for the door.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Racer X– He stops.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: I thought we made a good team today. It felt
like we’d been doing it for a long time. He hesitates.</p>
<p><strong>racer x</strong>: If you say so. He turns away leaving Speed
alone.</p>
<p><strong>chicken’s</strong>: Remmington wrings the phone as if it were
a neck.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: Ineptitude? Is this what I pay you
for?</p>
<p><strong>cruncher</strong>: They ain’t checkered yet.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: If. they do, I assure you it will be a
very costly mistake for everyone. He hangs up.</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: Mr. Remmington, you have Mr. Mushi on
line two. Remmington was dreading this call. He hits the button.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: Mr. Mushi–</p>
<p><strong>mushi</strong>: So, is this what guarantee means to you,
Mr. Remmington? Perhaps your dictionary has a different definition.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: I understand there is a problem, but I
assure you there is no need to panic.</p>
<p><strong>mushi</strong>: I am not calling to panic. I am calling to
inform you that we will be addressing the problem ourselves, as your
assurances and guarantees leaves much to be desired. He hangs up leaving
Remmington to stew in his juice.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: It was very weird, Trix. I knew every move he
was going to make and he knew mine. It was so familiar. Maybe I’m crazy
but Racer X first showed up two years after Rex’s death.</p>
<p><strong>trixie</strong>: But Speed, Rex was cremated.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: A body was cremated. Remember it had already
been badly burned in the crash. Even if it was Rex, no one could have
recognized him.</p>
<p><strong>trixie</strong>: So you think he faked the crash with a
different body in the driver’s seat?</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Somehow the kwik-save was disconnected.
Inspector Detector suspected foul play but nothing could be proved.</p>
<p><strong>trixie</strong>: okay, let’s say it’s all true. Why would we
do it?</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: I don’t know. Maybe the same reason I’m here.
Ding dong. Speed goes to the door.</p>
<p><strong>c.i.b. security man</strong>: I’m sorry to disturb you sir,
but do you know these people? Speedsticks his head out and there they
are–</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: Is this the kind of driver I have? Someone who
disobeys? Someone who lies to me? Is this the kind of son I have raised?
And you, Trixie, you know what this race did to this family. Did either
of you stop to think about us? Huh? Speed, did you think about your
mother? Or your brother?</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: What it would do if something happened to
you?</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: That’s all I’ve been thinking about, Pops.
You, Mom, Sprittle, Sparky. Chim-chim shouts.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Yeah, you too, Chim-chim. We are in serious
trouble,,Pops, and it’s all my fault.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: This is not the place or the race to do
anything about that.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: Because it won’t do any good?</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: You don’t know that.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: You think you can drive a car and change the
world?! It doesn’t work like that!</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Maybe not. But it’s the only thing I know how
to do and I gotta do something.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: That’s unacceptable! This is over. Pack your
things. We’re going home. Speed has never directly disobeyed his
father.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: I can’t. I’m sorry, Pops.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: I’m staying.</p>
<p><strong>trixie</strong>: So am</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: No you’re not! You’re coming home, right
now!</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: I’m not a child, Pops. You can’t tell me how
to live my life. If you want to fire me as your driver, then fine, do
it. But it won’t change the fact that I am going to.finish this race.
Pops looks ready to have an aneurism.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: God, you sound like Rex. Do you want to die
like him too? Will that make you happy?</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Don’t take it out on me because you feel
guilty for what happened to Rex.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: okay, you two. That’s enough. Pops, if they’re
staying, then we’re staying.</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: All right, room service!</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: I suggest we try to do everything we can to
make sure we go home together. toe with Pops fumes working his jaw,
standing toe to Speed.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: Where’s the Mach-5?</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Logged with security.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: You added something to it?</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Some defensive modifications.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: The whole thing’s out of balance, isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: It pulls left, rides a little stiff.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: Sparky. Pops and Sparky leave to do their
work. Speed feels terrible. He looks at his Mom.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: I’m sorry, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Your father loves you Speed. He’s just afraid
that–</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: I know. It’s gonna be okay.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: You wouldn’t lie to your mother would you?</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Never again. She hugs him..</p>
<p><strong>sparky</strong>: I got him! I got hiiiyow– The ninja throws
Sparky across the room and tries to bolt but Speed is up and throwing a
quick combo. The ninja stumbles, but a manages a spin-kick that knocks
Speed back as– Pops grabs the ninja from behind.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: You attack my family?1 You try to hurt my
son?! Pops twists the squirming ninja through a series of wrestling
moves– Finishing the ninja in a spinning over head helicopter—-</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Launching him out the window. Trixie and
Mom burst in from the adjoining room.</p>
<p><strong>trixie</strong>: Oh my god? Was that a ninja? Pops cracks his
knuckles.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: More like a non-ja. Terrible what passes for a
ninja these days. s still She looks out the window and smiles; this
family’ got it.</p>
<p><strong>trixie</strong>: Cool beans. There is a hurried knock at the
door.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: I’ll get it. It is Horuko, surrounded by
security.</p>
<p><strong>horuko</strong>: Oh, I am sorry. I was looking for Speed
Racer. Speed moves to the door.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Horuko? Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>horuko</strong>: No. Something terrible has happened.</p>
<p><strong>racer x</strong>: Narcolyte Benzamine. A highly effective and
debilitating drug.</p>
<p><strong>racer x</strong>: Stays in the system for hours, but leaves
with no trace.</p>
<p><strong>katsu</strong>: I’ll be…fine…by morning…</p>
<p><strong>racer x</strong>: No you won’t. You can’t drive a car. You
can barely stand up. Katsu leaps to his feet.</p>
<p><strong>katsu</strong>: You do not tell me what I can do– He suddenly
collapses to the floor.</p>
<p><strong>katsul</strong>: She tries to help him, but he is
unconscious.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: What are we going to do? They all look to
each other for an answer, but no one seems to have one.</p>
<p><strong>mushi</strong>: .I have been assured that our problem has
been solved.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: Perhaps your definition of “solved” is
different from mine.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: The second leg of the Casa Cristo is
under way. And the stage is set for what might be one of the most
ferocious rallies we’ve seen in years.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Watch your line! Okamoto adjusts.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Cut left! Now! Speed. flies into block for
Okamoto, but Okamoto doesn’t create enough space.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Watch it! They kiss with the shriek of
crashing metal.</p>
<p><strong>sparky</strong>: Packs leaning left, look for a slingshot on
the right!</p>
<p><strong>racer x</strong>: Speed, you’re too tight! The cars bounce
and Speed takes a hit, spinning for moment before he regains control.
Speed mumbles to himself.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: This is completely–</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: Absolutely crazy.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: The chopper is ready ma’am. Horuko is
escorted out, surrounded by her security detail.</p>
<p><strong>thug</strong>: She’s leavin’ da hotel now.</p>
<p><strong>sparky</strong>: Wicked sidewinder coming up. Watch the
inside-out. Could get ugly.</p>
<p><strong>thug</strong>: Yeah, boss. Signal’s loud and clear. On the
dash is a GPS map with a blinking signal.</p>
<p><strong>inspector detector</strong>: They’re airborne? You’re sure?
Good. Double the guard for her arrival in Bartimaeus. I gave my word
nothing would happen to his sister and I mean to keep it. The Inspector
gets another call.</p>
<p><strong>inspector detector</strong>: Inspector Detector..-.Mrs.
Racer? What kind of emergency?</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Left! Drift tight! Tight! Okamoto looks like
he’s about to go over the edge.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>cruncher</strong>: Don’t do it! They raise their hands.</p>
<p><strong>cruncher</strong>: On the ground! Now! They get on.the floor.
Horuko stands and Cruncher whips his gun around to her.</p>
<p><strong>gotcha–</strong>: But suddenly, something is wrong, his eyes
going wide as he realizes– Horuko is not Horuko. Horuko is Katsu.</p>
<p><strong>cruncher</strong>: What the– Katsu snatches Cruncher’s gun
and the Fixer is too stunned to do anything to stop it.</p>
<p><strong>cruncher</strong>: You-cheater. The security team seizes hold
of him.</p>
<p><strong>cruncher</strong>: But if you’re here, who’s–?</p>
<p><strong>trixie</strong>: That’s better. Couldn’t see anything. She
gains control and eases the car into the slot.</p>
<p><strong>sparky</strong>: That’s it. Nice line, Trix.</p>
<p><strong>sparky</strong>: Top of the hill’s coming. Snake’s got at
least a quarter mile’on ya.</p>
<p><strong>trixie</strong>: Well, let’s go get him.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: If you’d been a little more careful, he
wouldn’t be ahead of us.</p>
<p><strong>trixie</strong>: I told you I couldn’t see outta this dang
helmet. It’s too big.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: I can’t believe you talked us into this
ridiculous idea.</p>
<p><strong>trixie</strong>: What’s ridiculous about it? You’re the one
always telling me I’m a better driver than most of the WRL.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Now’s not the time to prove it!</p>
<p><strong>trixie</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: It’s too dangerous!</p>
<p><strong>trixie</strong>: Too dangerous for me but not for you?</p>
<p><strong>racer x</strong>: Children, focus! If we’re going to have a
chance we’re going to have to pass Snake before the rendezvous.</p>
<p><strong>trixie</strong>: I’m ready. Let’s roll. She floors it,
pulling out, leaving Speed shaking his head and trying to keep up. They
smear through a hairpin turn and as they close on the nearest cars it is
immediately apparent that they are no longer driving protectively or
defensively– They are attacking. Racer X leaps at the bumper of one car,
corner-checking him into the rail while– Trixie hits like a cue ball on
the break, scattering several cars– Leaving Speed little to clean
up.</p>
<p><strong>sparky</strong>: Wahoo! Go get ’em, girl!</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Here they come! Pick it up!</p>
<p><strong>c.c. announcer</strong>: Here comes the Okamoto team, making
their move.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Watch it! What’re you doin’?! The mountains
undulate, the cars dip and rise caught in the current of this concrete
river– Flowing one way then another, the cars sawing across the belly of
one bend, drifting into the curve of another</p>
<p><strong>until–</strong>: The Hydrocell emerges over the crest of a
hill with the Okamoto team tight to their bumpers.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Just try it! Try to pass! Just try it! Racer
X knows they’re ready.</p>
<p><strong>racer x</strong>: Take ’em.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: With pleasure. Speed slingshots from the back
position, hurling alongside the HydroCell team until– Snake blocks him,
setting up an attack by one of his team but this just allows Racer X a
hole to punch through. The cars continue to slug it out still weaving up
the mountain road, climbing it seems to helicopter or blimp height.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Now the gloves are off and they are
pounding one another, bumper to bumper, rail to rail!</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: Oh yeah! Pops can’t help a flash of
delight.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: .that’s my boy.</p>
<p><strong>c.c. announcer</strong>: The Okamoto team roars into the lead
behind some very aggressive driving by Speed Racer.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: You kiddin’ me? He just tore Snake a new
tailpipe!</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Trix? You all right? She’s obviously shaken
up.</p>
<p><strong>trixie</strong>: Yeah, sure. 10–4 and ready for more. Speed
shakes his head, wanting this to be over.</p>
<p><strong>racer x</strong>: Then let’s move it. We got some time to eat
up.</p>
<p><strong>cruncher</strong>: Haven’t ya heard? Cheaters never
prosper.</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: Sir, we’ve got the lead! They’re
heading for the rendezvous, now! Katsu looks back at Cruncher and
smiles.</p>
<p><strong>katsu</strong>: Excellent.</p>
<p><strong>thug</strong>: Somethin’ ain’t right.</p>
<p><strong>horuko</strong>: You’re sure, no cameras here?</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: Checked it this morning. Quite a few dead
spots in these mountains.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: I told you– She turns ready to fight, if
that’s what he wants.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: You are one helluva driver. She smiles.</p>
<p><strong>trixie</strong>: You’re not so bad yourself. Sparky and Pops
go to work, changing fuel cells and starting to pound out some of the
serious dents. Racer X sees Cruncher guarded by the security team.</p>
<p><strong>racer x</strong>: What’s he doing here?</p>
<p><strong>katsu</strong>: Stowaway. Weren’t sure what to do with
him.</p>
<p><strong>racer x</strong>: Do what he’d do; break his legs and let him
walk back. Horuko bows to Trixie.</p>
<p><strong>horuko</strong>: Thank you so much.</p>
<p><strong>trixie</strong>: It was a blast.</p>
<p><strong>sparky</strong>: Cells reloaded!</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Let’s go! They start to turn until machine
gun fires objects.</p>
<p><strong>thug</strong>: Nobody move! The thugs emerge from the
surrounding wood.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: What is this?!</p>
<p><strong>up</strong>: He strides towards the nearest goon but bullets
spit</p>
<p><strong>in</strong>: the earth and snow at his feet causing him to
freeze place.</p>
<p><strong>cruncher</strong>: This is called a change of plan. Now
freed, one of the thugs tosses him a gun.</p>
<p><strong>thug</strong>: Yeah, that’s right. We’re changing your plan
that changed our plan to change your plan. - .right boss? Cruncher
decides to ignore that.</p>
<p><strong>cruncher</strong>: The new plan– what was it, again? Break
your legs, make you.walk back? I like that. He stands smiling in front
of Racer X.</p>
<p><strong>cruncher</strong>: But first, I think it’s time to play a
little peek-a-boo, I-see- you.</p>
<p><strong>c.c. announcer</strong>: We are still waiting for the Okamoto
team to come out of the pass.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Those roads can really ice up. Very
dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: Monkey cookie! He turns just as– Whap! A
monkey cookie in the kisser.</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: Nice shot! Chim-chim howls as Sprittle
reloads his sling-shot.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: Sprittle?!</p>
<p><strong>cruncher</strong>: Get that monkey! The goons are confused,
distracted, and before they can control it, the fight is on– Racer X
throws the thug holding him– Speed and Trixie dish out equal measures of
chop-socky and good of American slug-fu as– Pops grapples and wrestles
his goon into a head-lock. Racer X hammers Cruncher to the ground where
he sees his gun, scrambling for it but just as he reaches for it– Katsu
steps on his hand. It’s a short quick turn around and–</p>
<p><strong>racer x</strong>: Looks like another change of plan.</p>
<p><strong>while</strong>: The security guards herd up Cruncher and the
thugs Pops turns his attention to–</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: Sprittlel Get over here!</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: Ahhhh! He and Chim-chim run behind
Speed.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Sprittle this isn’t a game. You could’ve been
killed in there.</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: I.know it was bad! I know we shouldn’t
have done it. But Chim- chim was really really scared.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Chim-chim?</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: Okay, I was a little scared too.</p>
<p><strong>trixie</strong>: Scared of what? Sprittle clings to his big
brother.</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: I didn’t want what happened to Rex to
happen to you. Racer X and Pops feel a hidden wound open.</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: We just thought if you got into trouble,
maybe we could help and it’s a good thing we did. a good Speed looks at
Pops as if Sprittle is making point.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: Oh no, you’re not getting off that easy. If
your mother hasn’t had a heart attack already, I’m sure she’ll know what
to do with you two. tires and The last of Pops line is lost to the
squeal of roar of engines as the HydroCell team flies by.</p>
<p><strong>katsu</strong>: Go! Go! Go! They rush to their cars, Speed
leaping into the Mach-5. Engines. growl, tires spin and gravel spits as
the three cars shoot back into the race.</p>
<p><strong>c.c. announcer</strong>: First out of the pass is… the
HydroCell team?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Uh-oh. They better send the emergency
trailer–</p>
<p><strong>c.c. announcer</strong>: Wait! Is that– Like eagles dropping
from the sky, the Okamoto ream soars out of the mouth of the pass.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Here we go again.</p>
<p><strong>c.c. announcer</strong>: Whatever happened in that pass has
left Okamoto back where they started but now only one obstacle stands
between Snake oiler and</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: The Maltese Ice Caves.</p>
<p><strong>tnt. helicopter</strong>: Trixie notices as Pops begins to
bite his lip. She whispers to Sparky.</p>
<p><strong>trixie</strong>: This is where Rex… Sparky nods.</p>
<p><strong>katsu</strong>: Speed?! What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>racer x</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: I’m fine. Ahead, the HydroCell team grows
from small silhouettes flashing in and out of sight,. closer and closer,
larger and larger until– once more the three chase cars lock onto their
rear bumper.</p>
<p><strong>racer x</strong>: The next cave’s a rattler.</p>
<p><strong>katsu</strong>: What is that?</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Double S.</p>
<p><strong>racer x</strong>: We’ll make our move in there.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Where there is no purchase for
advertisements– Only the cold, wet darkness where white lights chase
after red ones. Speed tries to shake his fear when X calls for the
attack.</p>
<p><strong>racer x</strong>: Now. The cars split apart, Racer X leading
the charge as– Sparks flash as with the cross of swords, metal striking
metal and– The ice-crusted walls sparkle with star-bursts of</p>
<p><strong>violence–</strong>: The cacophony ringing through the first
bending curve. It is obvious that the conditions are much more
difficult, a sword fight on a frozen lake– Each of the drivers,
skidding, wobbling, drifting farther then they anticipated, but– The
Okamoto team are just too good, eliminating one and then the other
HydroCell cars until– Speed again has Snake in his sights. This time,
though, Snake is ready.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Not this time, punk! He throws the lever and
beneath his car– A violent spray of freezing gas immediately skim coats
the road with a fresh shimmering glaze of ice that— Speed hits going
full throttle, immediately spinning wildly out of control. He screams
trying to hold on as he spits out the end of the cave– Smashing through
the rail, separating from the earth– Hanging for a moment against the
soundlessness of the open sky– Before dropping like a stone.</p>
<p><strong>racer x</strong>: Speed!</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Oh no!</p>
<p><strong>c.c. announcer</strong>: Speed Racer’s gone over the
edge!</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: He did.not! He did not just do that!</p>
<p><strong>c.c. announcer</strong>: Speed Racer is. driving straight up
a cliff face–are we getting this?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: This kid is unbelievable!</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: Go, Speed, go!</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Hi. Remember me? Speed roars up after him and
Snake grabs for his lever again but now it’s Speed that’s ready– Jumping
over the ice, he body slams Snake, sending him hard into the rail as
Speed shoots into the lead.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Not again! Not again! He grabs at an ankle
holster, yanking out a gun.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Oh my god, he’s got a gun!</p>
<p><strong>gun!</strong>: Snakes fires just as– Speed hits the cockpit
bubble and the bullets smack against it like a sledgehammer into a brick
wall.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: He swerves knowing he won’t be able to
take many hits as Snake chases after him, firing as– Speed hits the
crampons again and runs up the side of the mountain then– Flips off the
wall just as the cliff face drops off, switching sides as– Snake now
finds himself on the outside as Speed bashes him out through the guard
rail. Snake tries a similar move to Speed but Snake is no Speed- And his
car bursts apart as he miss-times the flip, sending a bouncing cocoon to
the distant snows below.</p>
<p><strong>c.c. announcer</strong>: Snake oiler completely going out of
his mind–</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Could have been altitude sickness, it gets
crazy up there–</p>
<p><strong>casa cristo announcer</strong>: Whatever it was, Speed
handled it beautifully and with less than 250 kilometers to go, nothing
seems to stand between Okamoto–</p>
<p><strong>c.c. announcer</strong>: – And victory! The checkered flag
comes down, hundreds of flashbulbs capturing the moment as Katsu leads
Speed and Racer X across the finish line.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The stock of Okamoto engineering climbs
two points.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: Get me… Tetsuya Okamoto.</p>
<p><strong>katsu</strong>: We make a good team.</p>
<p><strong>racer x</strong>: We did our part. Make sure you do yours.
Racer X stares at Katsu whose face is as expressionless as a mask but it
feels as though Racer X can see right through it.</p>
<p><strong>katsu</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: Congratulations Mr. Okamoto. Very
impressive race.</p>
<p><strong>okamoto</strong>: Yes, thank you. You are very generous,
Mr. Remmington.</p>
<p><strong>reporter 2</strong>: Speed, does this mean you’ve signed with
Okamoto?</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Uh, no. This was… a mutually beneficial
opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>katsu</strong>: Yes, well put.</p>
<p><strong>reporter 3</strong>: Katsu, does this mean you will be
running in the Grand Prix this weekend?</p>
<p><strong>katsu</strong>: We’ll see. Right now I’m just going to enjoy
this victory.</p>
<p><strong>okamoto</strong>: The price is 78 a share.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: That’s outrageous! The price is barely
above 50! This is extortion! Blackmail! I’ll sue you! Tie up every asset
you own up for the next 20 years!</p>
<p><strong>okamoto</strong>: As you wish Mr. Remmington. Have a nice
day.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: Wait! He grinds his molars until they
are smooth.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: Seventy-eight a share. I’ll have the
papers drawn up.</p>
<p><strong>okamoto</strong>: A pleasure doing business with you.</p>
<p><strong>okamoto</strong>: You have done very well for us, my son.
Katsu smiles the same smile as his father. The only person not smiling
in the room is Horuko.</p>
<p><strong>sparky</strong>: I don’t get it. What just happened?</p>
<p><strong>pops.</strong>: Okamoto played us for chumps. All he wanted
was our help to drive up the stock on his family’s company. Even if
there was a file, he had no intention of turning it over.</p>
<p><strong>sparky</strong>: You mean that whole race was for
nothing?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: For a moment he believes that he is
again driving beside the ghost of his brother but when the two cars kiss
up against each other, Speed realizes this is no ghost– It’s Racer X.
The masked Racer suddenly becomes the focus of all his anger and Speed
swings his car, wielding it like a club, trying to clobber him. Racer X
dodges the first blow and swings back, the two have at one another,
banging, shoving one another into the wall– Until Speed can’t take it
anymore and he goes at X as ferociously as he can, throwing him into a
tailspin– Crashing him into one of the grand stands. Silence embraces
the track. Speed climbs out of the Mach 5.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: X? Racer X? There is a small movement in the
car, a shuddering as though in pain and Speed realizes he may have gone
too far.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Racer X?!! He runs to the car but immediately
stops when he realizes the masked man is not in pan; he is laughing. He
practically falls out of his car.</p>
<p><strong>racer x</strong>: Jeezus, kid. You can drive. I haven’t been
thrown like that in years.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>racer x</strong>: The inspector told me what happened., I
came looking for you.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>racer x</strong>: Thought you’d take it hard and maybe do
something stupid.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Why would you care?</p>
<p><strong>racer x</strong>: Because you’re a fighter. And a friend.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Why don’t you just tell me the truth? Racer X
stares at him hard.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: You’re Rex, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>racer x</strong>: You mean your brother?</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Youfirstappeared two years after Rexdied.You
drive just like him.Youknew I’d be here because thisis where he always
used to takeme.Just tell me the truth. mask. After a long hard moment,
Racer X pulls off his He is not Rex. Speed is stunned.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: You’re… not Rex.</p>
<p><strong>racer x</strong>: No. I’m sorry Speed but your brother is
dead. He pulls his mask back on.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>racer x</strong>: Don’t be. I’m sure where ever your brother
is, he is immensely proud of you.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: For what? Making the same mistakes he
did?</p>
<p><strong>racer x</strong>: For trying to make a difference. From what
I’ve read, that’s all he tried to do.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: And what good did it do? He got killed for
nothing. Racing hasn’t changed and it never will!</p>
<p><strong>racer x</strong>: It doesn’t matter if racing never changes.
What matters is if we let racing change us. Everyone of us has to find
the reason to do this. You don’t climb into a T- 180 to be a driver. You
do it because you’re driven.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: I don’t know why I’m doing it anymore.</p>
<p><strong>racer x</strong>: That’s obvious. At Fuji, you were trying to
prove something. At Cristo, you were looking for justice. Neither are
the reason you belong behind a steering wheel.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: If you know so much, why don’t you tell me
why I should keep driving?</p>
<p><strong>racer x</strong>: Sorry. That’s for you to figure out. He
climbs back into his car.</p>
<p><strong>racer x</strong>: I just hope when you do, I’m there. to see
it. He roars away leaving Speed alone.</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: Hey watcha doin?</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: What’s it look like?</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: Where ya goin?</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: I don’t know. I just gotta get away from
here.</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Because.</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: Because why?</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Because I have to.</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: Can we come with you? Speed is struck by
an odd sense of deja vu.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: Can we come with you?</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: You’ll understand when it’s your turn. He
shoulders his bag and shoves out the door.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: Speed, before you go, I’d like to say a few
things. Will you sit with your old man for a minute? Speed chafes a bit
but drops his bag.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Don’t try to stop me.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: I won’t. I made a mistake trying to tell you
what to do at Cortega. You were right. I was wrong. I won’t make that
mistake again. Speed sits.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: I want you to know that I acted rashly. I said
things I wish I hadn’t. Your mother usually protects me from making an
ass out of my self but I was determined to do it this time and I guess I
did a pretty good job of it. I wanted to make sure you understood how
sorry I was.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: The truth was, I couldn’t have been more proud
of you son. Not because you won, but because you stood up, you weren’t
afraid and you did what you thought was right.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: So? It didn’t amount to anything. It was
completely meaningless.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: How could it be meaningless? I saw my son
become a man. I watched him act with courage and integrity and drive the
pants off of every driver on the road. This is not meaningless. This is
the reason for a father’s life. Pop’s eyes’begin to twinkle with
tears</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: I admit I went to Cortega because I was afraid
that what happened to Rex was going to happen to you. And I just
couldn’t take that. I couldn’t loose another one of my boys like that
again. But what I realize in Cortega was that I didn’t lose Rex when he
crashed, I lost him here. I lost him when he walked out of this house
and I let him go without telling him how proud I was of him and how much
I loved him. I let him think that a stupid motor company meant more to
me than he did. You’ll never know how much I regret that mistake, but
it’s enough that I’ll never make it again. He puts his big bear arms
around him and hugs him.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: I love you Speed. I understand that every
child leaves home but I want you to know that door is always open and
you can always come back.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: I love you Pops. I’m just so confused right
now. I don’t what I’m doing or why I’m doing it. I’m locked up in some
kinda tailspin and no direction makes sense.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: I know what that’s like. When Rex died I
didn’t even. know if I wanted salt on my eggs, let alone if I wanted to
keep building cars. Then, do you remember when we sat here, that night,
watching old Ben Burns and Dugazi? You remember that? Speednods
vaguely.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: Sittin’ here, cheering with you, something
just clicked, like a light being switched on inside of me and after
that, I never had trouble remembering how I liked me eggs.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Jeez Pops. That’s just it. That’s part of my
problem.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: That race. The ’43 Prix. Burns and Dugazi? It
was fixed. Remmington told me the whole story. It was all about some DNF
names Rotts. They’ve known the winner of every Grand Prix for the past
50 years. It’s always fixed. That’s a tough pill for Pops to
swallow.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: I don’t believe that. Remmington’s a crook.
You can’t believe a crook.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: I don’t think he was lying, Pops.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: The Grand Prix? A sham? Ding dong.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: Who could that be?</p>
<p><strong>with</strong>: Speed opens the door. She seems to glow,
radiating her own incandescence.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Horuko?!</p>
<p><strong>horuko</strong>: Forgive me for intruding but I had to come
before it was too late. Speed eyes her for a moment wondering if this is
another set-up.</p>
<p><strong>horuko</strong>: This is not a trick. I swear to you. I am
not my brother.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: You going to ask the lovely lady in?</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Yeah, sure. Come on in. She steps in, looking
somewhat out of place in the suburban living room.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: Can I get you something to drink?</p>
<p><strong>horuko</strong>: No. My security man believes I am still at
the opera, so I only have a moment. She turns to Speed.</p>
<p><strong>horuko</strong>: I am very sorry for what happened. what my
father and brother did was not right and I am ashamed.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: It’s fine. Just another lesson learned.</p>
<p><strong>horuko</strong>: No.. It is they who are in need of a lesson.
She pulls an envelope out of her bag and gives it to Speed.</p>
<p><strong>horuko</strong>: This rightfully belongs to you. He opens the
envelope and his eyes immediately light up.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: An invitation to compete in the 91st annual
Grand Prix?</p>
<p><strong>horuko</strong>: My brother was planning to decline anyway
but I studied the rules very carefully and as a member of the Okamoto
team, if you present this invitation on the day of the race, they must
allow you to compete. Pops bursts into a smile and slaps Speed on the
back.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: Whaddya think of that, Mr. Its-
Always-Fixed?</p>
<p><strong>horuko</strong>: You do not have to say anything. I only hope
you drive as you did in Casa Cristo and you wipe the smiles from their
faces.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: We don’t have a car. Sparky!</p>
<p><strong>sparky</strong>: Right here Pops. Sparky steps out of the
kitchen doorway.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: What’re you doing in the kitchen?</p>
<p><strong>sparky</strong>: Same as everyone else. Behind him the entire
family peeks out.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: I don’t believe it. You were listening the
whole time? Trixie goes to him.</p>
<p><strong>trixie</strong>: We were worried about you.</p>
<p><strong>horuko</strong>: I would say good luck Saturday but you do
not need it. You are already very lucky to have such a family.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Goodbye and thank you. He closes the
door.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: Come on! We got work to do.</p>
<p><strong>sparky</strong>: But Pops, the race is less than 36 hours
away.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: Isn’t that how fast Remmington said he could
build that tin can with all his fancy machines?</p>
<p><strong>sparky</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: Then we’ll do it in 32. Let’s go! He heads for
the garage, Sprittle leaping after him.</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: I want to help.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: Well come on.</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: Chim-chim too?</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: We need everyone.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: I swear to you Mr. Mushi when the GRX is
revealed at the Grand Prix and then captures the black and white
checkers the demand for our transponder engines will go through the
roof. Mushi.smiles.</p>
<p><strong>sparky</strong>: Alright, fire it up! Everyone holds their
breath as Speed hits the ignition. The car makes a sick baying rattle
and smoke begins pouring out of the engine.</p>
<p><strong>sparky</strong>: Kill it! Kill it!</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen, behold the future.
It’s black, shiny, and beautiful in a malefic way.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Sparks, it’s getting late.</p>
<p><strong>sparky</strong>: I know, I know. Okay. Give it a try.
Everyone braces as Speed hits the ignition. It is the sound of an
explosion held in the palm of your hand.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Sounds beefy Pops.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: It gives you a little something extra.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Let’s get it loaded!</p>
<p><strong>cass jones</strong>: This year marks a new record as the
Grand Prix will be broadcast in eighty-four different languages. The
camera pans. over the multitude of ethnic broadcasters.</p>
<p><strong>cass jones</strong>: Just gets bigger every year, doesn’t it
Ben?</p>
<p><strong>ben burns</strong>: Seems like it.</p>
<p><strong>cass jones</strong>: We’ve got an incredible lineup this
year. Some major competition. We got a few fan favorites like the Gray
Ghost, Sonic “Boom-boom” Renaldi and Prince Kabala. We got perenial
powerhouses like Nitro Venderhoss, Gary “Gearbox” Kalinkov, and Mori
Minimoto.</p>
<p><strong>ben burns</strong>: Not to mention C ball.</p>
<p><strong>fuji announcer</strong>: Cannonball Taylor, fastest Grand
Prix seed in history, driving the new ORX from Remmington Racecars.</p>
<p><strong>ben burns</strong>: She looks mighty tight.</p>
<p><strong>fuji announcer.</strong>: There is an odd numbered field
today, nineteen, one shy of a full boat as Katsu Okamoto declined his
automatic invitation after winning the Casa Cristo.</p>
<p><strong>ben burns</strong>: Hey there’s something going on down
there.</p>
<p><strong>cass jones</strong>: We’re seeing some kind of commotion down
at the trailer entrance.</p>
<p><strong>inspector detector</strong>: Is there a problem here,
officer?</p>
<p><strong>tnt. grand prix penthouse</strong>: Remmington is in his
element, everything seeming to go exactly as planned until Gennie comes
up behind him and whispers in his ear.</p>
<p><strong>gennie</strong>: Sir, we have a problem.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: What madness is going on here?</p>
<p><strong>senior race official</strong>: Mr. Remmington, this is a
legitimate invitation. We have verified it.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: Where did you get that?</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: I was on the Okamoto team remember? I won it
fair and square.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: This is preposterous! He can’t be
allowed to race. It’s too late.</p>
<p><strong>inspector detector</strong>: The ruling on this is quite
clear. Try to stop it and you’ll be in blatant violation of the WRL
charter, leaving me no option but to shut this years Prix down until a
full investigation can be completed.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: What?! Do you have any idea what that
would cost? Are you insane?</p>
<p><strong>inspector detector</strong>: Try me. Remmington stews then
spits a threat at Speed.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: You’ll regret this.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Doubt it.</p>
<p><strong>cass jones</strong>: Something big is going on because every
race official has been– wait, wait. An announcement is being made. A new
driver is being added to the field.</p>
<p><strong>ben burns</strong>: Holy sh–</p>
<p><strong>bleep.</strong>: Ben Burns gets bleeped by the network
censors.</p>
<p><strong>female announcer voice</strong>: Now driving in the twentieth
and final position, Speed Racer. The roar from the crowd shakes the
windows of–</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: A million dollars to the driver that
takes Racer out.</p>
<p><strong>cannonball</strong>: He won’t get out of the blocks.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: I prefer him to not even make it out of
the locker room. Cannonball smiles as Remmington starts to turn.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: We’re installing a spear hook on the
GRX.</p>
<p><strong>cannonball</strong>: I don’t need one to beat that punk.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: A precaution.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Oh no…</p>
<p><strong>gray ghost</strong>: Hey kid–</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: The Gray Ghost…</p>
<p><strong>gray ghost</strong>: Just wanted to say good luck. He reaches
out to shake, then whispers.</p>
<p><strong>gray ghost</strong>: There’s a million dollar bounty on your
head.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: A million dollars? Wow. Maybe I should take
myself out.</p>
<p><strong>gray ghost</strong>: Watch yourself. Your ruffling some
pretty major feathers here.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Why aren’t you after the bounty?</p>
<p><strong>gray ghost</strong>: Our little dance at Fuji–that’s how it
should always be.</p>
<p><strong>cass jones</strong>: As the cars take to the field you can
feel the anticipation mounting in the audience. Something is different.
There is an electricity in the air. The presence of Speed Racer has
completely changed the equation.</p>
<p><strong>racer x</strong>: Speed Racer? Speed turns, taking a moment
to realize the handsome millionaire playboy in the tux is unmasked Racer
X. He glances down at Speed’s belongings and sees a picture of Rex.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>playboy/racer x</strong>: I’m quite a fan of yours and just
wanted to say how glad I am to see you here. As they shake hands, Racer
X realizes that something is wrong.</p>
<p><strong>playboy/racer x</strong>: Is something wrong?</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: I just… I got this thing… its stupid, I know,
a superstition, but I guess all of us got one.</p>
<p><strong>playboy/racer x</strong>: Can I help? Speed suddenly notices
the red trim of his tuxedo and his red tie. He looks down and heaves a
sigh of relief. Red socks.</p>
<p><strong>cass jones</strong>: There he is now, Speed Racer, perhaps
the biggest wild card in Grand Prix history.</p>
<p><strong>trixie</strong>: Look! There’s Speed!</p>
<p><strong>cass jones</strong>: Speed Racer gets his first eyeful of the
Coliseum.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: This ain’t Kansas baby!</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Hey, mouth-breather, get used to</p>
<p><strong>this–</strong>: He shows Speed his ass.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: ’Cause that’s what you’re going to be
looking at all day! Speed tries to ignore him and the other driver’s
staring at him like a fox staring at a chicken.</p>
<p><strong>sparky</strong>: Howya feelin’? Speed takes a breath as he
dares to look around again.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: .it’s big.</p>
<p><strong>sparky</strong>: Hey, this cockpit is the exact same size it
was at Thunderhead.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>sparky</strong>: Just wanted to say, thanks, for what could
be the most exciting moment of my life.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Couldn’t have gotten here without you. He
hugs him.</p>
<p><strong>sparky</strong>: I’m looking forward to that cold milk.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Me too. Speed climbs in as the speaker system
blares–</p>
<p><strong>female announcer voice</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen, start
your engines. The engines erupt, crashing against the waves of the
roaring crowd but– Inside the Mach 5 everything goes completely silent.
Nothing exists now for Speed except the track as he loses all separation
between himself and his car. He takes a deep breath and closes his eyes
as the countdown begins.</p>
<p><strong>cass jones</strong>: The final countdown has begun and a
stillness has fallen over this stadium as all eyes turn to one car.</p>
<p><strong>ben burns</strong>: This ain’t a race. It’s a showdown.</p>
<p><strong>path–</strong>: He tries to avoid it but can’t, rear-ending
him while the car behind him slams into the back of the Mach 5.</p>
<p><strong>cass jones</strong>: Trouble at the start, a misfire traps
Speed Racer, causing a</p>
<p><strong>ben burns</strong>: Uh-oh. Look out!</p>
<p><strong>cass jones</strong>: I don’t know how he got out of that
one–</p>
<p><strong>ben burns</strong>: That-kid’s wiley.</p>
<p><strong>cass jones</strong>: Speed fakes left, jumps right–</p>
<p><strong>ben burns</strong>: Nice, nice–</p>
<p><strong>cass jones</strong>: He slips in behind Gearbox—</p>
<p><strong>ben burns</strong>: Here comes over under–</p>
<p><strong>ben burns</strong>: I told you! I told you!</p>
<p><strong>cass jones</strong>: Speed Racer seems unstoppable, moving up
from dead last, nearing the leaders as they head into the slalom with
the Gray Ghost battling Prince Kabala and Cannonball Taylor for the
lead.</p>
<p><strong>gray ghost</strong>: Where am I? Where am I? I’m here. I am
over there. I’m Savior Faire! The Prince tries to block the Ghost but he
can’t seem to locate him.</p>
<p><strong>gray ghost</strong>: I’m everywhere, baby! Wham! The Ghost is
on him, pouncing, slipping into what feels like a shoulder throw that
sends the Prince spinning out of control onto the onrushing Nitro–
Shattering the Prince’s car like a mis-struck diamond reduced in one
hammer stroke to twinkling dust.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The two more cocoons bounce onto the
road as the other cars roar past.</p>
<p><strong>cass jones</strong>: A spectacular crash as the Prince’s
jewel-covered Gigerbon worth an estimated 22 million dollars is
scattered over a quarter mile of track.</p>
<p><strong>ben burns</strong>: I’d like to work clean up on that crash.
They chuckle.</p>
<p><strong>cass jones</strong>: But look out, as they approach the Big
Drop, here comes Speed Racer?</p>
<p><strong>him–</strong>: The green Mushi motors car, the Gray Ghost,
and the Black</p>
<p><strong>cass jones</strong>: Speed Racer is knocking on the door of
the new GRX driven by Cannonball Taylor.</p>
<p><strong>ben burns</strong>: You hoot Anybody home?</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Ok Mr. Two Time Grand Prix, Five time WRL,
future Hall of Fame, teach me something.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Come on! Is that it? He swerves back and the
two cars begin to battle but it is immediately clear who is the better
driver, as– Speed throws Cannonball from one side of the track to the
other.</p>
<p><strong>cass jones</strong>: Cannonball Taylor is in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>ben burns</strong>: Tear `em up kid!</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: Do it. Stop him. Stop him now.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Lesson’s over. See you at the finish line.
Speed slides into Cannonball to throw him but as he does–</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Cannonball throws a hidden switch and
under the two cars a spear hook shoots out and locks onto the Mach 5
undercarriage. Speed feels it and knows what happened immediately.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>sparky</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: Spear hook! He’s got me! Cannonball slows
driving both cars into the wall, grinding against the Mach 5 while the
trailing cars shoot post.</p>
<p><strong>cass jones</strong>: Cannonball has Speed pinned as they
grind through the butterfly turn.</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: That cheater! He’s using a spear hook!
SPEAR HOOK! SPEAR HOOK! The surrounding crowd becomes uncomfortable.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: Sprittle, we don’t know that.</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: I do! Cannonball Taylor is nothing but a
big cheater!</p>
<p><strong>ben burns</strong>: This is going to be ugly.</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: Told you so! Chim-chim high fives him.</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: Cheaters never prosper!</p>
<p><strong>cass jones</strong>: Cannonball clearly using a spear
hook.</p>
<p><strong>ben burns</strong>: That could cost him the Hall of Fame.</p>
<p><strong>cass jones</strong>: Not to mention what it might do to
Remmington Industries.</p>
<p><strong>ben burns</strong>: Shame on them.</p>
<p><strong>sparky</strong>: Oh no, come on, don’t do this.</p>
<p><strong>pops</strong>: Don’t quit on us now baby.</p>
<p><strong>racer x</strong>: Careful. Listen to it. Don’t kill the
starter.</p>
<p><strong>speed</strong>: What do you need? Something makes him put the
car in second gear. He steps on the accelerator, then hits the starter
and— And the Mach 5 roars to life. The crowd screams to the wail of
burning rubber.</p>
<p><strong>cass jones</strong>: He’s back in it, but less than a lap and
a half, I don’t know what kind of chance he has.</p>
<p><strong>ben burns</strong>: Come on kid! Move it!</p>
<p><strong>cass jones</strong>: Look at the split! He’s shattering the
lap record.</p>
<p><strong>ben burns</strong>: Don’t mean a thing without those
checkers.</p>
<p><strong>while–</strong>: Inside, Speed is perfectly at pease.</p>
<p><strong>cass jones</strong>: No hesitation, nothing fazes him, no one
seems capable of stopping him.</p>
<p><strong>ben burns</strong>: This kid ain’t just driving–he’s on a
mission.</p>
<p><strong>remmington</strong>: Stop him! Stop him!</p>
<p><strong>gray ghost</strong>: Welcome back kid. Been lonely up here
without you.</p>
<p><strong>cass jones</strong>: With a quarter lap to go Speed Racer is
back, two cars beneath him and destiny.</p>
<p><strong>gray ghost</strong>: Oh yeah, here we go, here we go. Speed
flashes one way, then another, moving in ghost-like feigns, here there,
and everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>gray ghost</strong>: What’s this? What’s this? Hey now!
That’s my move! Before Ghost knows where to go, Speed ducks past–</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Sling-shotting down alongside the Mushi
motors car. The Yukuza driver tries to block but– Speed jumps, dodging
the hit, causing the Mushi car to swerve and then wildly correct–
Swinging back as Speed hop-scotches over him again, just</p>
<p><strong>as–</strong>: The Ghost flies in, taking a broadside hit from
the Mushi car, both of them exploding just feet from the finish line,
as– Speed launches up and through the cloud of smoke and fire, crossing
into history with the flashing wave of the checkered black and white–
Fluttering softly in the silence as the crowd begins to rise to their
feet. The Mach 5 slides to a stop and for a moment Speed catches his
breath, then, slowly pulling off his helmet he begins to let it all in–
The thunder of the crowd can be felt through his chest straight to his
heart.</p>
<p><strong>cass jones</strong>: It’s a pandemonium! People have gone
completely crazy! In fourteen years we’ve never seen anything like
this!</p>
<p><strong>ben burns</strong>: It’s a whole new world baby, a whole new
world.</p>
<p><strong>inspector detector</strong>: He did it. Racer X lowers his
binos and turns to the inspector.</p>
<p><strong>racer</strong>: Yes, he did.</p>
<p><strong>inspector detector</strong>: This could change
everything.</p>
<p><strong>racer x</strong>: It already has.</p>
<p><strong>inspector detector</strong>: My men are bringing the family
down. Do you want to go with them?</p>
<p><strong>racer x</strong>: He turns and takes Minx by the arm.</p>
<p><strong>inspector detector</strong>: Can I ask you a question? Do you
ever think you made a mistake, hiding the truth from them?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: There is a flash of images as we glimpse
the truth; images of Rex watching his car explode in the ice caves, his
funeral, then the facial surgery, then the mask of bandages as one face
is lost in a mirror and another is revealed.</p>
<p><strong>racer x</strong>: If I did, then it’s a mistake I have to
live with. He walks away while—</p>
<p><strong>trixie</strong>: Speed! She pushes towards him and he sweeps
her up into his arms and kisses her, surrounded by the sparkle of camera
flash</p>
<p><strong>as—</strong>: Sprittle covers Chim-chim’s eyes.</p>
<p><strong>sprittle</strong>: Danger. May cause cookies. Mom and Pops
both hug Speed, their eyes bright with joy</p>
<p><strong>as–</strong>: We rise up, up, and away. Roll snazzy
credits.</p>
