<h1 id="smoke">smoke</h1>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I’ll tell you why they’re not going
anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Yeah? And why is that?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Management. Those guys are walking around
with their heads up their asses.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: They made some great deals. Tommy.
Hernandez. Carter. Without those two, there never woulda been no World
Series.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: That was four years ago. I’m talking about
now. Look who they got rid of. Mitchell. Backman. McDowell. Dykstra.
Aguillera. Mookie. Mookie Wilson, for Chrissakes.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: And Nolan Ryan. Don’t forget him.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Yeah. And Amos Otis.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Okay, joke about it. I don’t give a shit.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Jesus, Tommy, it ain’t science, you know. You
got your good trades and your bad trades. That’s how it works.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: They didn’t have to do a thing, that’s all
I’m saying. The team was good, the best fucking team in baseball. But
then they had to screw it up. They traded their birthright for a mess of
porridge. A mess of porridge.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: How’d you do out there, Jimmy?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Good, Auggie. Real good. All finished.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: It’ll never be finished.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: That’s how it is with sidewalks. People
come, people go, and they all drop shit on the ground. As soon as you
clean up one spot and move on to the next, the first spot is dirty
again.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I just do what you tell me, Auggie. You tell
me to sweep, so I sweep.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Hey, Jimmy. You got the time?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: You still have that watch Auggie gave
you?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Tick-tock, tick-tock.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: So what’s the time?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Twelve-eleven. Twelve-twelve.
Twelve-twelve.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Ninety-two dollars?</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: They don’t come cheap, son. These little
honeys are works of art. Rolled by hand in a tropical climate, most
likely by an eighteen year old girl in a thin cotton dress with no
underwear on. Little beads of sweat forming in her naked cleavage. The
smooth, delicate fingers nimbly turning out one masterpiece after
another…</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: And how much are these?</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Seventy-eight dollars. The girl who rolled
these was probably wearing panties.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: And these?</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Fifty-six. That girl had on a corset.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: And these?</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Forty-four. They’re on special this week
from the Canary Islands. A real bargain.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: I think I’ll take them.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: A good choice. You wouldn’t want to
celebrate the birth of your firstborn with a box of stinkers, would you?
Remember to keep them in the refrigerator until you hand them out.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: The refrigerator?</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: It’ll keep them fresh. If they get too dry,
they’ll break. And you don’t want that to happen, do you? Tobacco is a
plant, and it needs the same loving care you’d give an orchid.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Thanks for the tip.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Any time. And congratulations to you and
your wife. Just remember, though, in the immortal words of Rudyard
Kipling: “A woman is just a woman, but a cigar is a smoke.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Damned if I know. But it has a nice ring to
it, don’t it?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hey, Auggie. How’s it going?</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Hey, man. Good to see you. What’ll it be
today?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Two tins of Schimmelpennincks. And throw in a
lighter while you’re at it.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: The boys and I were just having a
philosophical discussion about women and cigars. Some interesting
connections there, don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Definitely. I suppose it all goes back to
Queen Elizabeth.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: The Queen of England?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Not Elizabeth the Second, Elizabeth the First.
Did you ever hear of Sir Walter Raleigh?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Sure. He’s the guy who threw his cloak down
over the puddle.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I used to smoke Raleigh cigarettes. They came
with a free gift coupon in every pack.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: That’s the man. Well, Raleigh was the person
who introduced tobacco in England, and since he was a favorite of the
Queen’s – Queen Bess, he used to call her – smoking caught on as a
fashion at court. I’m sure Old Bess must have shared a stogie or two
with Sir Walter. Once, he made a bet with her that he could measure the
weight of smoke.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: You mean, weigh smoke?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Exactly. Weigh smoke.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You can’t do that. It’s like weighing
air.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I admit it’s strange. Almost like weighing
someone’s soul. But Sir Walter was a clever guy. First, he took an
unsmoked cigar and put it on a balance and weighed it. Then he lit up
and smoked the cigar, carefully tapping the ashes into the balance pan.
When he was finished, he put the butt into the pan along with the ashes
and weighed what was there. Then he subtracted that number from the
original weight of the unsmoked cigar. The difference was the weight of
the smoke.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Not bad. That’s the kind of guy we need to
take over the Mets.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Oh, he was smart, all right. But not so smart
that he didn’t wind up having his head chopped off twenty years later.
But that’s another story.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Seven eighty-five out of twenty. Take care
of yourself now, and don’t do anything I wouldn’t do.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I wouldn’t think of it. See you around,
fellas.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: What is he, some kind of wise guy?</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Nah. He’s a good kid.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I’ve seen him around. He comes in here a lot,
don’t he?</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Couple of times a week, maybe. He’s a
writer. Lives in the neighborhood.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: And what kind of writer is he? An
underwriter?</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Very funny. Some of the cracks you make.
Tommy, sometimes I think you should see a doctor. You know, go in for
some wit therapy or something. To clean out the valves in your
brain.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: It was just a joke.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: The guy’s a novelist. Paul Benjamin. You
ever hear of him? That’s a stupid question. The only things you guys
read is the Racing Form and pages of the Post. He’s published three or
four books. But nothing now for the past few years.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: What’s the matter? He run out of ideas?</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: He ran out of luck. Remember that holdup out
here on Seventh Avenue few years back?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: You talking about the bank? The time those
two guys started spraying bullets all over the street?</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: That’s it. Four people got killed. One of
them was Paul’s wife. The poor lug, he hasn’t been the same since. The
funny thing was, she stopped in here just before it happened. To stock
up on cigars for him. She was a nice lady, Ellen. Four or five months
pregnant at the time, which means that when she was killed, the baby was
killed, too.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Bad day at Black Rock, eh, Auggie?</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: It was bad, all right. I sometimes think
that if she hadn’t given me exact change that day, or if the store had
been a little more crowded, it would have taken her a few more seconds
to get out of here, and then maybe she wouldn’t have stepped in front of
that bullet. She’d still be alive, the baby would have been born, and
Paul would be sitting at home writing another book instead of wandering
the streets with a hangover.</p>
<p><strong>4. int</strong>: DAY. PAUL’S APARTMENT. A BROWNSTONE BUILDING
IN PARK SLOPE:</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Watch out, man. You’ll get yourself killed
like that.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I can’t believe I did that … Christ. I’m
walking around in a fog …</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: No harm done. Everything’s okay now. I’ve
got to be going.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No, wait. You can’t just walk off. You saved
my life.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: I just happened to be there. The right place
at the right time.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I owe you something.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: It’s okay, mister. No big deal.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yes it is. It’s a law of the universe. If I
let you walk away, the moon will spin out of orbit … pestilence will
reign over the city for a hundred years.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Well, if you put it that way…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You have to let me do something for you to put
the scales in balance.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: That’s all right. If I think of something,
I’ll send my butler over to tell you.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Come on. At least let me buy you a cup of
coffee.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: I don’t drink coffee. On the other hand,
since you insist, if you offered me a cold lemonade. I wouldn’t say
no.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Good. Lemonade it is. I’m Paul.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Rashid. Rashid Cole.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Are you sure you don’t want some food to go
along with it? It might help to absorb some of that liquid. You don’t
want to slosh around too much when you stand up.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: That’s okay. I’ve already had lunch.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You must eat lunch pretty early. It’s only
eleven o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: I mean breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yeah, sure, and I bet you had lobster last
night. Along with two bottles of champagne.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Just one bottle. I believe in
moderation.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Look, kid, it’s okay with me. You don’t have
to play games. If you want a hamburger or something, go ahead and order
it.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Well, maybe just one. To be polite.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Cocktail hour is over. The young man would
like to order a hamburger.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: How do you want that cooked?</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Medium rare, please.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Fries?</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Yes, please.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Lettuce and tomato?</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Yes, please.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: You want another one of these, too?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yeah, give him another one. And I’ll take a
cup of coffee while you’re at it.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Hot coffee or iced coffee?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Do you have real iced coffee, or do you just
pour hot coffee over some ice cubes?</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Everything is real in here, honey. As real
as the color of my hair.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’ll take the iced coffee. You only live once,
right?</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: If you’re lucky. Then again, it depends on
what you call living.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I don’t mean to pry, but I see a kid walking
around with a big knapsack on his back, and I begin to wonder if all his
worldly possessions aren’t stowed in there. Are you in some kind of
trouble or what?</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Mostly what.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You don’t have to tell me if you don’t want
to, but I might be able to help.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: You don’t know me from a hole in the
wall.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: That’s true. But I also owe you something, and
I’m not sure that buying you a hamburger is going to do the job. What is
it? Family problems? Money problems?</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Oh no. Momsie and Popsie have oodles.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: And where do Momsie and Popsie live?</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: East Seventy-fourth Street.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: In Manhattan?</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Of course. Where else?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Then what are you doing in Park Slope? It’s a
little far from home, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: That’s where the what comes in.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: The what?</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: The what. I’ve kind of run away from home,
you see. It has nothing to do with my parents or money. I saw something
I wasn’t supposed to see, and for the time being it’s best that I keep
myself out of sight.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You can’t be more specific than that?</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Here and there. Around.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Uh-huh. One of those cozy bed and breakfast
places, probably.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Yeah, that’s right.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Except that there’s no bed, is there? And no
breakfast either.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: The material world is an illusion. It
doesn’t matter if they’re there or not. The world is in my head.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: But your body is in the world, isn’t it? If
someone offered you a place to stay, you wouldn’t necessarily refuse,
would you?</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: People don’t do that kind of thing. Not in
New York.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m not “people.” I’m just me. And I do
whatever I goddamn want to do. Got it?</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Thanks, but I’ll manage.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: In case you’re wondering, I like women, not
little boys. And I’m not offering you a long-term lease – just a place
to crash for a couple of nights.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: I can take care of myself. Don’t worry.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Suit yourself. But if you change your mind,
here’s the address.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: One burger medium rare with lettuce and
tomato. One order of fries. One lemonade. And one dose of reality.</p>
<p><strong>vinnie</strong>: Okay. I think everything’s set. You’ve got
the number for Cape Cod, right? Just in case something goes wrong.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: No problem, Vinnie. Everything’s under
control. I could run this store in my sleep.</p>
<p><strong>vinnie</strong>: How long you been working for me,
Auggie?</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: I don’t know. Thirteen, fourteen years.
Something like that.</p>
<p><strong>vinnie</strong>: It’s pretty crazy, don’t you think? I mean,
a smart guy like you. What do you want to hang on to a dead-end job like
this for?</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: I don’t know. Maybe because I love you so
much, boss.</p>
<p><strong>vinnie</strong>: Shit. You should have been married to
someone by now. You know, settled down somewhere with a kid or two, a
nice steady job.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: I almost got married once.</p>
<p><strong>vinnie</strong>: Yeah, I know. To that girl who moved to
Pittsburgh.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Ruby McNutt. My one true love.</p>
<p><strong>vinnie</strong>: Sounds like another one of your stories to
me.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: She upped and married some other cat after I
joined the navy. By the time I got my discharge, though, she was
divorced. Her husband poked out her eye in a domestic quarrel.</p>
<p><strong>vinnie</strong>: Lovely.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: She made a play for me after I got back, but
her glass eye kept interfering with my concentration. Every time we got
into a clinch, I’d start thinking about that hole in her head, that
empty socket with the glass eye in it. An eye that couldn’t see, an eye
that couldn’t shed any tears. The minute I started thinking about it,
Mr. Johnson would get all soft and small. And I can’t see getting
married if Mr. Johnson isn’t going to be in tiptop shape.</p>
<p><strong>vinnie</strong>: You don’t take anything seriously, do
you?</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: I try not to, anyway. It’s better for your
health. I mean, look at you, Vincent. You’re the guy with the wife and
three kids and the ranch house on Long Island. You’re the guy with the
white shoes and the white Caddy and the white shag carpet. But you’ve
had two heart attacks, and I’m still waiting for my first.</p>
<p><strong>vinnie</strong>: I should stop smoking these damn things is
what I should do. The fuckers are going to kill me one day.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Enjoy it while you can, Vin. Pretty soon,
they’re going to legislate us out of business anyway.</p>
<p><strong>vinnie</strong>: They catch you smoking tobacco, they’ll
stand you up against a wall and shoot you.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Tobacco today, sex tomorrow. In three or
four years, it’ll probably be against the law to smile at strangers.</p>
<p><strong>vinnie</strong>: Speaking of which, are you still going ahead
with that deal on the Montecristos?</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: It’s all set. My guy in Miami said he’d have
them within the next few weeks. Are you sure you don’t want to go in
with me? Five thousand dollars outlay, a guaranteed ten-thousand-dollar
return. A consortium of Court Street lawyers and judges. They’re just
drooling to get their lips around some genuine Cuban cigars.</p>
<p><strong>vinnie</strong>: No thanks. I don’t care what you do, but
just make sure you don’t get caught, okay? The last I heard, it was
still illegal to sell Cuban cigars in this country.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: It’s the law that’s buying. That’s what’s so
beautiful about it. I mean, when was the last time you heard of a judge
sending himself to jail?</p>
<p><strong>vinnie</strong>: Suit yourself. But don’t keep the boxes
around here long.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: They come in, they go out. I’ve got it
planned to the last detail.</p>
<p><strong>vinnie</strong>: I’ve got to get moving. Terry will bust my
chops if I’m late. See you in September, Auggie.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Okay, my man. Love to the wife and kids, et
cetera, et cetera. Drop me a postcard if you can remember the
address.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Are you closed?</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: You run out of Schimmelpennincks?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Do you think I could buy some before you
leave?</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: No problem. It’s not as though I’m rushing
off to the opera or anything.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Looks like someone forgot a camera.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Yeah, I did.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It’s yours?</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: It’s mine all right. I’ve owned that little
sucker for a long time.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I didn’t know you took pictures.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: I guess you could call it a hobby. It
doesn’t take me more than about five minutes a day to do it, but I do it
every day. Rain or shine, sleet or snow. Sort of like the postman.
Sometimes it feels like my hobby is my real job, and my job is just a
way to support my hobby.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: So you’re not just some guy who pushes coins
across a counter.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: That’s what people see, but that ain’t
necessarily what I am.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: How’d you get started?</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Taking pictures? It’s a long story. I’d need
two or three drinks to get through that one.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: A photographer …</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Well, let’s not exaggerate. I take pictures.
You line up what you want in the viewfinder and click the shutter. No
need to mess around with all that artisto crap.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’d like to see your pictures some day.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: It can be arranged. Seeing as how I’ve read
your books. I don’t see why I shouldn’t share my pictures with you. It
would be an honor.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: They’re all the same.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: That’s right. More than four thousand
pictures of the same place. The corner of 3rd Street and Seventh Avenue
at eight o’clock in the morning. Four thousand straight days in all
kinds of weather. That’s why I can never take a vacation. I’ve got to be
in my spot every morning. Every morning in the same spot at the same
time.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’ve never seen anything like it.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: It’s my project. What you’d call my life’s
work.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Amazing. I’m not sure I get it, though. I
mean, how did you ever come up with the idea to do this … this
project?</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: I don’t know, it just came to me. It’s my
corner, after all. It’s just one little part of the world, but things
happen there, too, just like everywhere else. It’s a record of my little
spot.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It’s kind of overwhelming.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: You’ll never get it if you don’t slow down,
my friend.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: I mean, you’re going too fast. You’re hardly
even looking at the pictures.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: But they’re all the same.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: They’re all the same, but each one is
different from every other one. You’ve got your bright mornings and your
dark mornings. You’ve got your summer light and your autumn light.
You’ve got your weekdays and your weekends. You’ve got your people in
overcoats and galoshes, and you’ve got your people in shorts and
T-shirts. Sometimes the same people, sometimes different ones. And
sometimes the different ones become the same, and the same ones
disappear. The earth revolves around the sun, and every day the light
from the sun hits the earth at a different angle.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Slow down, huh?</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Yeah, that’s what I’d recommend. You know
how it is. Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, time creeps on its petty
pace.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Jesus, look. It’s Ellen.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Yeah. There she is. She’s in quite a few
from that year. She must have been on her way to work.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It’s Ellen. Look at her. Look at my sweet
darling.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Shit. Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>voice from the intercom</strong>: Rashid.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>voice from the intercom</strong>: Rashid Cole. The lemonade
kid, remember?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yeah. Come on up.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I didn’t expect to see you again.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Same here. But I had a long talk with my
accountant this afternoon. You know, to see how a move like this would
affect my tax picture, and he said it would be okay.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: That’s it. Just the two rooms.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: This is the first house I’ve been in without
a TV.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I used to have one, but it broke a couple of
years ago and I never got around to replacing it. I’d just as soon not
have one anyway. I hate those damn things.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: But then you don’t get to watch the ball
games. You told me you were a Mets fan.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I listen on the radio. I can see the games
just fine that way. The world is in your head, remember?</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Nice drawing. Did you do that?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: My father did. Believe it or not, that little
baby is me.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Yeah, I can believe it.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It’s strange, though, isn’t it? Looking at
yourself before you knew who you were.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Is your father an artist?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No, he was a schoolteacher. But he liked to
dabble.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: He’s dead?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Twelve, thirteen years ago. Actually, he died
with his sketch pad open on his lap. Up in the Berkshires one weekend,
drawing a picture of Mount Greylock.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Drawing’s a good thing.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Is that what you do? Draw pictures?</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Yeah, sometimes. I like to dabble, too.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Time to wake up. Hey, kid, time to wake up.
Rashid! Up and out. I have to work in here. The slumber party is
over.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Eight-thirty.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Eight-thirty?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You’ll find juice and eggs and milk in the
refrigerator. Cereal in the cupboard. Coffee on the stove. Take whatever
you want. But it’s time for me to get started in here.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: May I speak to Emily Vail, please? Yes,
thank you, I’ll wait. Aunt Em? Hi, it’s me. I just wanted you to know
I’m okay. I know, I’m sorry. I just didn’t want you to worry about me.
Just cool it, okay? Take it easy.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Jesus, do you make a lot of noise. Can’t you
see I’m trying to work?</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: I’m sorry. They just… they just slipped out
of my hands.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: A little less clumsiness around here would be
nice, don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: I’m a teenager. All teenagers are clumsy.
It’s because we’re still growing. We don’t know where our bodies end and
the world begins.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: The world is going to end pretty soon if you
don’t learn fast. Look, why not make yourself useful? I’m just about out
of smokes. Go around the corner to the Brooklyn Cigar Company and buy me
two tins of Schimmelpenninck Medias.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Twenty dollars is a lot of money. Are you
sure you can trust me with it? I mean, aren’t you afraid I might steal
it?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: If you want to steal it, that’s your business.
At least I won’t have you around here making noise. It might be worth
it.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: I’m sorry. I’m really sorry… I was trying to
reach for one of the books up there … And then, I don’t know, the sky
fell on top of me.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It just won’t do, will it? I go two and a half
years without being able to write a word, and then, when I finally get
started on something, when it looks as though I might actually be coming
to life again, you show up and start breaking everything in my house. It
just won’t do, will it?</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: I didn’t ask to come here. You invited me,
remember? If you want me to leave, all you have to do is say so.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: How long have you been here?</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Three nights.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: And how long did I tell you you could
stay?</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Two or three nights.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It sounds like our time is up, doesn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: I’m sorry I messed up. You’ve been very kind
to me … But all good things have to come to an end, right?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No hard feelings, okay? It’s a small place,
and I can’t get my work done with you around.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: You don’t have to apologize. The coast is
probably clear now anyway.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Are you going to be all right?</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Absolutely. The world is my oyster. Whatever
that means.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Do you need some money? Some extra
clothes?</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Not a penny, not a stitch. I’m cool,
man.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Take good care of yourself, okay?</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: You too. And make sure the light is green
before you cross the street. Oh, by the way, I liked your book. I think
you’re a hell of a good writer.</p>
<p><strong>aunt em</strong>: Is your name Paul Benjamin?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What can I do for you?</p>
<p><strong>aunt em</strong>: I just want to know what your game is,
mister, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: How the hell did you get into the
building?</p>
<p><strong>aunt em</strong>: What do you mean, how’d I get in? I pushed
the door and walked in. What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: The damn lock’s broken again. And so you just
barge in on strangers, is that what you do? Is that your game?</p>
<p><strong>aunt em</strong>: I’m looking for my nephew, Thomas.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Thomas? Who’s Thomas?</p>
<p><strong>aunt em</strong>: Don’t give me any of that. I know he’s been
here. You can’t fool me, mister.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m telling you. I don’t know anyone named
Thomas.</p>
<p><strong>aunt em</strong>: Thomas Cole. Thomas Jefferson Cole. My
nephew.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You mean Rashid?</p>
<p><strong>aunt em</strong>: Rashid? Rashid! Is that what he told you
his name was?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Well, whatever his name is, he’s not here
anymore. He left two days ago, and I haven’t heard from him since.</p>
<p><strong>aunt em</strong>: And what was he doing here in the first
place? That’s what I want to know. What’s a man like you messing around
with a black boy like Thomas for? Are you some kind of pervert, or
what?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Look, lady, that’s enough. If you don’t calm
down. I’m going to throw you out. Do you hear me? Right now!</p>
<p><strong>aunt em</strong>: I just want to know where he is.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: As far as I know, he went back to his
parents.</p>
<p><strong>aunt em</strong>: His parents? Is that what he told you? His
parents?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: That’s what he said. He told me he lived with
his mother and father on East Seventy-fourth Street.</p>
<p><strong>aunt em</strong>: I always knew that boy had an imagination,
but now he’s gone and made up a whole new life for himself. Do you mind
if I sit down? He’s been living with me and his uncle Henry since he was
a baby. And we don’t live in Manhattan. We live in Boerum Hill. In the
projects.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: He doesn’t go to the Trinity School?</p>
<p><strong>aunt em</strong>: He goes to John Jay High School in
Brooklyn.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: And his parents?</p>
<p><strong>aunt em</strong>: His mother’s dead, and he hasn’t seen his
father in twelve years.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I shouldn’t have let him go.</p>
<p><strong>aunt em</strong>: Which brings me back to my original
question. What was he doing here in the first place?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I was about to get run over by a car, and your
nephew pulled me back. He saved my life. I sensed he was in trouble, so
I offered to put him up for a few days. Maybe I should have pressed him
a little more, I don’t know. I feel pretty stupid about it now.</p>
<p><strong>aunt em</strong>: He’s in trouble, all right. But I don’t
have any idea what it is.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Do you want something to drink? A beer? A
glass of water?</p>
<p><strong>aunt em</strong>: No thank you.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Has anything happened lately? Anything unusual
or unexpected?</p>
<p><strong>aunt em</strong>: Well, one thing I suppose, but I don’t
think it has anything to do with this. A friend of mine called about two
weeks ago and said she’d spotted Thomas’s father working at some gas
station outside of Peekskill.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: And you told your nephew about it?</p>
<p><strong>aunt em</strong>: I figured he had a right to know.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>aunt em</strong>: And nothing. Thomas looked at me straight
in the eye and said, “I don’t have a father. As far as I’m concerned,
that son-of-a-bitch is dead.”</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Those are pretty hostile words.</p>
<p><strong>aunt em</strong>: His father walked out on his mother a
couple of months after he was born. Louisa was Henry’s younger sister,
and she and the baby moved in with us. Four or five years go by, and
then one day Cyrus shows up out of the blue, tail between his legs,
wanting to patch things up with Louisa. I thought Henry was going to
tear Cyrus apart when he saw him walk through the door. They’re both big
men, those two, and if they ever started to tangle, you’d see some teeth
jumping on the floor. I guarantee it … So Cyrus persuaded Louisa to go
out with him to talk things over in quiet. And the poor girl never came
back.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You mean she just ran off with him and left
her little boy behind?</p>
<p><strong>aunt em</strong>: Don’t put words in my mouth. What I’m
saying is she drove off in Cyrus’s car and went to the Five-Spot Lounge
with him for a drink. What I’m saying is that he imbibed too much in the
way of alcohol and that when they finished their little talk three hours
later and got back in the car, he was in no shape to drive. But he drove
the car anyway, and before he could get her back to where she lived, the
damn fool ran a red light and went straight into a truck. Louisa got
thrown through the windshield and was killed. Cyrus lived, but he came
out of it a cripple. His left arm was so mangled, the doctors had to cut
it off. Small punishment for what he did, if you ask me.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>aunt em</strong>: Jesus had nothing to do with it. If He’d
been involved. He would have seen to it that things worked out the
opposite from what they did.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It can’t have been easy on him. Walking around
with that on his conscience all these years.</p>
<p><strong>aunt em</strong>: No, I don’t suppose it has. He was broken
up like nobody’s business in that hospital when he found out Louisa was
dead.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: And he’s never tried to get in touch with his
son?</p>
<p><strong>aunt em</strong>: Henry told Cyrus he’d kill him if he ever
showed his face around our house again. When Henry makes a threat like
that, people tend to take him seriously.</p>
<p><strong>cyrus</strong>: You going to sit here all day?</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: I don’t know. I haven’t decided yet.</p>
<p><strong>cyrus</strong>: Why don’t you pick some other spot? It gives
a man the creeps to be stared at all morning.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: It’s a free country, isn’t it? As long as
I’m not trespassing on your property. I can stay here till kingdom
come.</p>
<p><strong>cyrus</strong>: Let me give you some useful information, son.
There’s two dollars and fifty-seven cents in that cash register over
there and considering all the time you’ve put in casing the joint so
far, you won’t make but about fifty cents an hour for all your pains.
However you slice it, that’s a losing proposition.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: I’m not going to rob you, mister. Do I look
like a thief?</p>
<p><strong>cyrus</strong>: I don’t know what you look like, boy. As far
as I can tell, you sprouted up like a mushroom in this spot last night.
You live in this town – or on your way from here to there?</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Just passing through.</p>
<p><strong>cyrus</strong>: Just passing through. A lonesome traveler
with a knapsack on his back plops himself across from my garage to
admire the view. There’s other places to roam, kid, that’s all I’m
saying. You don’t want to make a nuisance of yourself.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: I’m working on a sketch. That old garage of
yours is so rundown, it’s kind of interesting.</p>
<p><strong>cyrus</strong>: It’s rundown, all right. But drawing a
picture won’t improve the way it looks. Let’s see what you did,
Rembrandt.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: It’ll cost you five bucks.</p>
<p><strong>cyrus</strong>: Five bucks! You mean you’re going to charge
me five bucks just to look at it?</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Once you look at it, you’re going to want to
buy it from me. That’s guaranteed. And that’s the price: five bucks. So
if you’re not willing to spring for it, you might as well not bother to
look. It’ll just tear you up inside and make you miserable.</p>
<p><strong>cyrus</strong>: Son-of-a-bitch. You’re some piece of work,
aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: I just tell it like it is, mister. If I’m
getting on your nerves, though, you might want to think about hiring
me.</p>
<p><strong>cyrus</strong>: Do you have eyes in your head, or are those
brown things bulging out of your sockets just marbles? You’ve been
sitting here all day, and how many cars have you seen drive up and ask
for gas?</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Not a one.</p>
<p><strong>cyrus</strong>: Not a one. Not one customer all day. I bought
this broken-down shit-hole of a place three weeks ago, and if business
don’t pick up soon, I’m going straight down the skids. What do I want to
be hiring someone for? I can’t even pay my own wages.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: It was just a thought.</p>
<p><strong>cyrus</strong>: Yeah, well, do your thinking somewhere else,
Michelangelo. I got work to do.</p>
<p><strong>cyrus</strong>: I’ll tell you what. You want to work. I’ll
give you a job. Nothing permanent, mind you, but that upstairs room over
there – the one above the office – is a hell of a mess. It looks like
they’ve been throwing junk in there for twenty years, and it’s time it
got cleaned up.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: What’s your offer?</p>
<p><strong>cyrus</strong>: Five bucks an hour. That’s the going rate,
isn’t it? It’s a quarter past two now. My wife’s picking me up at
five-thirty, so that’ll give you about three hours. If you can’t finish
today, you can do the rest tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Is there a benefits package, or are you
hiring me on a freelance basis?</p>
<p><strong>cyrus</strong>: Benefits?</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: You know, health insurance, dental plan,
paid vacation. It’s not fun being exploited. Workers have to stand up
for their rights.</p>
<p><strong>cyrus</strong>: I’m afraid we’ll be working on a strictly
freelance basis.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Five dollars an hour? I’ll take it.</p>
<p><strong>cyrus</strong>: The name is Cyrus Cole.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Paul. Paul Benjamin.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Auggie. Auggie, I think there’s a
customer.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Auggie?</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Christ, Ruby, it’s been so long. I figured
you were dead.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Eighteen and a half years.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Is that all? I thought it was about three
hundred.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: You’re looking good, Auggie.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: No I’m not. I look like shit. And so do you,
Ruby. You look just awful. What’s with the patch, anyway? What’d you do
with that old blue marble – hock it for a bottle of gin?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: I don’t want to talk about it. If you really
want to know. I lost it. And I’m not sorry I did. That eye was cursed,
Auggie, and it never gave me nothing but grief.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: And you think it looks better to go around
dressed up like Captain Hook?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: You always were a son-of-a-bitch, weren’t you?
A little weasel with a quick, dirty mouth.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: At least I’ve stayed true to myself. Which
is more than I can say about some people.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: I’ve got something to talk to you about, and
the least you can do is listen. You owe me that much. I drove all the
way from Pittsburgh to see you, and I’m not going until you’ve heard me
out.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Talk away, lady of my dreams. I’m all
ears.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: This is private, Auggie. Just between you and
I.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: You heard her, pipsqueak. The lady and I
have private business to discuss. Go outside and stand in front of the
door. If anyone tries to come in, tell ’em we’re closed. You got
that?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Sure, Auggie, I got it. The store’s closed.
And when do I tell them it’s open?</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: When I tell you it’s open. It’s open when I
tell you it’s open!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Okay, Auggie, I got it. You don’t have to
yell.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: All right, sugar, what’s on your mind?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Don’t look at me like that. Auggie. It gives
me the creeps.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Like what you’re doing. I’m not going to eat
you up. I need your help, and if you keep staring at me like that. I
might start screaming.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Help, huh? And I don’t suppose this help has
anything to do with money, does it?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Don’t rush me, okay? You’re jumping to
conclusions before I’ve even said anything. And besides, it’s not for
me. It’s for our daughter.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Our daughter? Is that what you said? Our
daughter? I mean, you might have a daughter, but I sure as hell don’t.
And even if I did – which I don’t – she wouldn’t be our daughter.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Her name is Felicity, and she just turned
eighteen. She ran away from Pittsburgh last year, and now she’s living
in some shit-hole here in Brooklyn with a guy named Chico. Strung out on
crack, four months pregnant. I can’t bear to think about that baby. Our
grandchild, Auggie. Just think of it. Our grandchild.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Stop it, already. Just stop all this crap
right now. Was that your idea to call her Felicity?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: It means “happiness.”</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: I know what it means. That still don’t make
it a good name.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: I don’t know who else to turn to, Auggie.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: You’ve suckered me before, darling,
remember? Why should I believe you now?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Why would I lie to you, Auggie? You think it
was easy to come here and walk into this place? Why would I do it if I
didn’t have to?</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: That’s what you told me when I shoplifted
that necklace for you. You remember, baby, don’t you? The judge gave me
a choice: either go to the can or enlist. So, instead of going to
college, I wind up in the navy for four years, I watch men lose their
arms and legs, I nearly get my head blown off, and you, sweet Ruby
McNutt, you run off and marry that asshole, Bill.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: You didn’t write to me for more than a year.
What was I supposed to think?</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Yeah, well, I lost my pen. By the time I got
a new one, I was clean out of paper.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: It was over with Bill before you ever came
home. Maybe you don’t remember it now, but you were pretty hot to see me
back then.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: You weren’t so lukewarm yourself. At least
at first.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: It fizzled, baby. That’s the way it goes. But
we had our times, didn’t we? It wasn’t all bad.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: A couple of moments, I’ll grant you that. A
second or two snatched from the jaws of eternity.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: And that’s how Felicity came into the picture.
During one of those two seconds.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: You’re conning me, sweetheart. I ain’t
responsible for no baby.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Then why do you think I married Frank? I was
already pregnant, and I didn’t have much time. Say what you like, but at
least he gave my kid a name.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Good old Frank. And how is fat Mr. Grease
Monkey these days?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Who the hell knows? He dropped out of sight
fifteen years ago.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Fifteen years ago? It won’t wash, pumpkin.
No mother waits fifteen years to tell a man he’s a father. I wasn’t born
yesterday, you know.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: I thought I could handle it. I didn’t want to
bug you. I thought I could handle it on my own, but I couldn’t. She’s in
real bad, Auggie.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Nice try, old girl. I’d like to help you
out. You know, for old time’s sake. But all my spare cash is tied up in
a business venture, and I haven’t collected my profits yet. Too bad. You
caught me at the wrong time.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: You’re a cold-hearted bastard, aren’t you?
How’d you ever get so mean, Auggie?</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: I know you think I’m lying to you, but I’m
not. Every word I told you is the God’s honest truth.</p>
<p><strong>cyrus</strong>: Time for a pause.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: I don’t mean to be nosy, but I was wondering
what happened to your arm.</p>
<p><strong>cyrus</strong>: An ugly piece of hardware, isn’t it? I’ll
tell you what happened to my arm. I’ll tell you what happened. Twelve
years ago, God looked down on me and said, “Cyrus, you’re a bad, stupid,
selfish man. First of all, I’m going to fill your body with spirits, and
then I’m going to put you behind the wheel of a car, and then I’m going
to make you crash that car and kill the woman who loves you. But you,
Cyrus, I’m going to let you live, because living is a lot worse than
death. And just so you don’t forget what you did to that poor girl, I’m
going to rip off your arm and replace it with a hook. If I wanted to, I
could rip off both your arms and both your legs, but I’m going to be
merciful and just take off your left arm. Every time you look at your
hook, I want you to remember what a bad, stupid, selfish man you are.
Let that be a lesson to you, Cyrus, a warning to mend your ways.”</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: And have you mended them?</p>
<p><strong>cyrus</strong>: I don’t know. I try. Every day I keep on
trying, but it’s no easy task for a man to change his nature. I’m off
the booze, though. Haven’t had a drop in six years. And now I’ve got me
a wife. Doreen. Best damned woman I’ve ever known. And a little boy,
too. Cyrus Junior. So things have definitely improved since I got fitted
with this hook. If I can just turn this goddamn garage around, I’ll be
in pretty good shape.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: You named the kid after yourself, huh?</p>
<p><strong>cyrus</strong>: That boy’s one in a million. A real
tiger.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Who, me? I don’t have a story. I’m just a
kid.</p>
<p><strong>cyrus</strong>: Hi, baby. How’d it go today?</p>
<p><strong>doreen</strong>: If I have to wash one more old lady’s hair,
I think my fingers would fall off.</p>
<p><strong>cyrus</strong>: Busy, huh? That’s good, because things around
here sure were sleepy today.</p>
<p><strong>doreen</strong>: Don’t worry, Cy. It’s early days yet. Say
hello to Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: Dada! Dada!</p>
<p><strong>cyrus</strong>: Hey there, little tiger. And what did you do
today?</p>
<p><strong>doreen</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>cyrus</strong>: Jesus, I almost forgot you were here. Doreen,
this is Paul. My new assistant.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: It’s only temporary. On a freelance
basis.</p>
<p><strong>cyrus</strong>: And this one, in case you haven’t guessed, is
Junior.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Hi there, little brother.</p>
<p><strong>cyrus</strong>: Say hi to Paul.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: Hi there, little brother.</p>
<p><strong>cyrus</strong>: He’s helping me clean out that upstairs room.
Might as well get this place looking good, anyway. I guess that’s it for
today, sport. Come back tomorrow morning at eight, and you can pick up
where you left off.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Tomorrow’s fine. There’s no rush.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hey, it’s you.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: I wanted to give you this as a token of my
appreciation.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Appreciation for what?</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: I don’t know. For helping me out.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Where did you get that thing?</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: I bought it. Twenty-nine ninety-five on sale
at Goldbaum’s TV and Radio. Well, that just about takes care of it, I
guess. You’ll be able to watch the ball games. You know, as a little
break from your work.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Where the hell do you think you’re going?</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Business appointment. I’m seeing my broker
at three o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Cut it out, will you? Just cut it out and come
back here.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: I don’t have much time.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Close the door. Sit down in that chair. Now
listen carefully. Your Aunt Em came here a couple of days ago. She was
sick with worry, out of her mind. We had an interesting talk about you,
Thomas. Do you understand what I’m saying? Your aunt thinks you’re in
trouble and so do I. Tell me about it, kid. I want to hear all about it
right now.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: You don’t really want to know.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I don’t, huh? And what makes you such an
authority on what I want or don’t want?</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Okay, okay. It’s all so stupid. There’s this
guy, see. Charles Clemm. The Creeper, that’s what people call him. The
kind of guy you don’t want to cross paths with.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: I crossed paths with him. That’s why I’m
trying to stay clear of my neighborhood. To make sure I don’t run into
him again.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: So that’s the something you weren’t supposed
to see, huh?</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: I just happened to be walking by… All of a
sudden, the Creeper and this other guy come running out of this
check-cashing place with masks on their faces and guns in their hands…
They just about ran smack into me. The Creeper recognized me, and I knew
he knew I recognized him… If the guy from the check-cashing place hadn’t
rushed out then screaming bloody murder, he would have shot me. I’m
telling you, the Creeper would have shot me right there on the sidewalk.
But the noise distracted him, and when he turned around to see what was
happening, I took off… One more second, and I would have been dead.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Why don’t you go to the police?</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: You’re joking, right? I mean, that’s your
way of trying to be funny, right?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: If they put this Creeper in jail, then you’d
be safe.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: The man has friends. And they’re not likely
to forgive me if I testify against him.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What makes you think you’ll be any safer
around here? It’s only about a mile away from where you live.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: It might not be far, but it’s another
galaxy. Black is black and white is white, and never the twain shall
meet.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It looks like they’ve met in this
apartment.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: That’s because we don’t belong anywhere. You
don’t fit into your world, and I don’t fit into mine. We’re the outcasts
of the universe.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Maybe. Or maybe it’s the other people who
don’t belong.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Let’s not get too idealistic.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Fair enough. We wouldn’t want to get carried
away, would we? Now call your aunt Em and let her know you’re alive.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Get in, Auggie. I’ve got something to show
you.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: You don’t give up, do you?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Just get in and shut up. I’m not asking you to
do anything. I just need you to come with me.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Where to?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Dammit, Auggie, don’t ask so many questions.
Just get in the car.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: I told her she was going to meet her
father.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: You what?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: It was the only way, Auggie. Otherwise, she
wasn’t going to let me see her.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: I think you’d better stop the car and let me
out.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Relax, okay? You don’t have to do anything.
Just go in there and pretend. It won’t kill you to do a little favor
like that. Besides, you might even learn something.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Yeah, like what?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: That I wasn’t bullshitting you, sweetheart. At
least you’ll know I’ve been telling the truth.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Look, I’m not saying you don’t have a
daughter. It’s just that she’s not my daughter.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Wait till you see her, Auggie.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: And what’s that supposed to mean?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: She looks just like you.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Cut it out. Just cut it out, okay? It’s
starting to get on my nerves.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: When I told her I was going to bring her
father, she kind of melted. It’s the first time Felicity’s talked nice
to me since she left home. She’s dying to meet you, Auggie.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Nice neighborhood you’ve brought me to. Full
of happy, prosperous people.</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Yeah? Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: It’s me, honey. It’s Mom.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Well what?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Aren’t you going to say anything?</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: What do you want me to say?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: I don’t know. Hello, Mom. Hello, Dad.
Something like that.</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: I don’t got no daddy, you dig? I got born
last week when some dog fucked you up the ass.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Jesus Christ. This is all I need.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: You told me you wanted to meet him. Well,here
he is.</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Yeah, I might have said that. Chico told
me to see what he was like, maybe there’d be some dough in it for us.
Well, now I’ve seen him, and I can’t say I’m too impressed. Hey, mister.
Are you rich or what?</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Yeah, I’m a millionaire. I walk around in
disguise because I’m ashamed of all my money.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Be nice, sweetie. We’re just here to help
you.</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Help? What the fuck do I need your help
for? I’ve got a man, don’t I? That’s more than you can say for yourself,
Hawkeye.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Hey, hey, don’t talk to your mother like
that.</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: You’re telling me you actually went to bed
with this guy? You’re telling me you actually let him fuck you?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: You can do whatever you want with your own
life. We’re thinking of the baby, that’s all. We want you to get
yourself cleaned up for the baby. Before it’s too late.</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Baby? And what baby is that?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Your baby. The baby you’re carrying around
inside you.</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Yeah, well, there ain’t no baby in there
now. You dig? There’s nothing in there now.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: An abortion, stupid. I had an abortion the
day before yesterday. So you don’t have to bug me about that shit
anymore. Bye-bye, baby!</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Come on, let’s get out of here. I’ve had
enough.</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Yeah, that’s right, you better go.
Chico’ll be back any minute, and I’m sure your boyfriend doesn’t want to
mess with him. Chico’s a real man. Not some scuzzy dickhead you find in
last month’s garbage. Do you hear what I’m saying? He’ll chop up Mr. Dad
here into little pieces. That’s a promise. He’ll kick the living shit
out of him.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Ah, coffee. Smells good.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: One sip of this stuff and your eyes will
blast open.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: What time did you get to bed last night?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I don’t know. Two or three. It was pretty
late.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: You work too hard, you know that?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Once a story gets hold of you, it’s hard to
let go. Besides, I’m making up for lost time.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Just so you don’t overdo it. You don’t want
to die of sleep deprivation before you finish.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: If you don’t sleep, you don’t dream. If you
don’t dream, you don’t have nightmares.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: That’s logical. And if you don’t sleep, you
don’t need a bed. Saves you money, too. So what’s this story you’re
working on, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: If I tell you, I might not be able to finish
it.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Come on, just a little hint.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Okay, just a little hint. I can’t tell you the
story, but I’ll tell you what gave me the idea for it.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: The inspiration.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yeah, right. The inspiration. It’s a true
story anyway, so I don’t suppose it can hurt, can it?</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: No way.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: All right. Listen carefully. About twenty-five
years ago, a young man went skiing alone in the Alps. There was an
avalanche, the snow swallowed him up, and his body was never
recovered.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: The end.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No, not the end. The beginning. His son was
just a little boy at the time, but the years passed, and when he grew
up, he became a skier, too. One day last winter, he went out by himself
for a run down the mountain. He gets halfway to the bottom and then
stops to eat his lunch next to a big rock. Just as he’s unwrapping his
cheese sandwich, he looks down and sees a body frozen in the ice – right
there at his feet. He bends down to take a closer look, and suddenly he
feels that he’s looking into a mirror, that he’s looking at himself.
There he is – dead – and the body is perfectly intact, sealed away in a
block of ice – like someone preserved in suspended animation. He gets
down on all fours, looks right into the dead man’s face, and realizes
that he’s looking at his father.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: So what are you going to do today?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Celebrate? What for?</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: It’s my birthday. I’m seventeen years old as
of forty-seven minutes ago, and I think I should celebrate having made
it this far.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hey, hey. Happy birthday. Why didn’t you tell
me?</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: I just did.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I mean earlier. We could have planned
something.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: I don’t like plans. I prefer to take things
as they come.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Here we are. Rembrandt’s drawings. Edward
Hopper. Van Gogh’s letters.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Pick two or three. Now that the coffers are
open, you might as well take advantage of me.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: We’ll take these, please.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Will that be cash or charge?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Better make it charge.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: I thought I recognized you. You’re Paul
Benjamin the writer, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I confess.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: I keep waiting for the next novel to come
out. Anything in the works?</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: It’s coming along. At the rate he’s going,
he’ll have a story finished by the end of the summer.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Wonderful. When your next book is published,
maybe you could come into the store and do a signing. I’m sure we could
get a lot of people to show up.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Uh, actually, I tend to shy away from that
kind of thing.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Excuse me for asking, but you aren’t
married, are you?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: What!</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Perhaps I should rephrase the question. What
I mean to say is, are you married or seriously involved with a
significant other?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: No! At least I don’t think I am!</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Good. Then may I have the honor of extending
an invitation to you?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: An invitation?</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Yes, an invitation. I apologize for
springing it on you at the last minute, but Mr. Benjamin and I are
attending a celebration tonight, and we would be most pleased if you
chose to accompany us. Isn’t that right, Mr. Benjamin?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Absolutely. We would be honored.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: And what’s the occasion of this
celebration?</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: It’s my birthday.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: And how many people will be attending this
birthday party?</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: I wouldn’t actually call it a party. It’s
more along the lines of a dinner in celebration of my birthday. The
guest list is quite restricted. So far, there’s Mr. Benjamin and myself.
If you accept, that would make three of us.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Ah-hah, I see. A cozy dinner. But aren’t
threesomes a little awkward? How does the phrase go–</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Three’s a crowd. Yes, I’m aware of that. But
I have to keep an eye on Mr. Benjamin wherever he goes. To make sure he
doesn’t get himself into trouble.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: And what are you, his chaperone?</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Actually, I’m his father.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It’s true. Most people assume I’m his father.
It’s a logical assumption – given that I’m older than he is and so on.
But the fact is, it’s the other way around. He’s my father, and I’m his
son.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: So your mother grew up in Shanghai?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Until she was twelve. She moved here in
’forty-nine.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: And your father? Is he from New York?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Muncie, Indiana. He and my mother met as
students. But I’m from Brooklyn. My sisters and I were all born and bred
right here.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Just like me.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Like me, too.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: I once read somewhere that one quarter of all
the people in the United States have at least one relative who has lived
in Brooklyn at one time or another.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: No wonder it’s such a screwed-up place.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: And the bookstore? Have you been working there
long?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: It’s just a summer job. Something to help pay
the bills while I finish my dissertation.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Your dissertation? What subject do you
study?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: American literature. What else?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What else. Of course, what else? And what are
you writing about for your thesis?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Visions of Utopia in Nineteenth-Century
American Fiction.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Wow. You don’t fool around, do you?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Of course I fool around. But not so much when
it comes to my work, it’s true. Have you ever read Pierre, or the
Ambiguities?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Melville, huh? It’s been a while.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: That’s the subject of my last chapter.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Not an easy book.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Which explains why this hasn’t been the
easiest summer of my life.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: All the more reason to let ’er rip tonight,
sweetheart. You know, go for the gusto.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Hey, man, good to see you.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: This is April Lee, Auggie. April, say hello to
Auggie Wren.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Hello, Auggie Wren.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Howdy, Miss April. I’m right pleased to make
your acquaintance. And this pretty little lady here is Miss Vi-o-let
Sanchez de Jalape�o, the hottest chili pepper this side of the Rio
Grande. Ain’t that so, baby?</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: Ees so, Auggie. And you not so cold,
neither. Eh, baby?</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: So, what brings you to a dive like this?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It’s his birthday so we decided to whoop it up
a little.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: How old, kid?</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Seventeen.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Seventeen? I remember when I was seventeen.
Christ, I was one little whacked-out son-of-a-bitch when I was
seventeen. Is that what you are, son? One little whacked-out crazy
fella?</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Definitely. I’d say you’ve hit the nail on
the head.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Good. Keep it up, and maybe one day you’ll
grow up and become a great man like me.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hey, Auggie, I’ve just been thinking. You
wouldn’t need some help around the store, would you? Some summer help
while Vinnie’s gone?</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Help? Hmm. It’s possible. What did you have
in mind?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m thinking about the kid. I’m sure he’d do a
good job for you.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Hey, kid. You interested in a job? I just
got word from your employment agency that you’re looking for a position
in retail sales.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: A job? I definitely wouldn’t turn down a
job.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Come around to the cigar store tomorrow
morning at ten o’clock and we’ll talk about it, okay? We’ll see what we
can work out.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Ten o’clock tomorrow morning. I’ll be
there.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I owe you one. Don’t forget.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It’s 1942, right? And he’s caught in Leningrad
during the siege. I’m talking about one of the worst moments in human
history. Five hundred thousand people died in that one place, and
there’s Bakhtin, holed up in an apartment, expecting to be killed any
day. He has plenty of tobacco, but no paper to roll it in. So he takes
the pages of a manuscript he’s been working on for ten years and tears
them up to roll his cigarettes.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: His only copy?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: His only copy. I mean, if you think you’re
going to die, what’s more important, a good book or a good smoke? And so
he huffed and he puffed, and little by little he smoked his book.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Nice try. You had me going for a second, but
no … no writer would ever do a thing like that. Would he?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You don’t believe me, huh? Look, I’ll show
you. It’s all in this book.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Is it yours?</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Yeah, it might be.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Here, catch.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: So you’re saying it wasn’t like that at
all.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Not exactly. I mean, there was more to it
than I told you.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Christ. You didn’t just see what happened.
They dropped the package on the ground and you picked it up.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Yeah, I picked it up.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: And started to run.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: And started to run.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Good thinking.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: That’s just it. I didn’t think. I just did
it.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You have one hell of a knack for getting into
trouble, don’t you? So how much does it come to?</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Six thousand dollars. Five thousand eight
hundred and fourteen dollars, to be exact.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: So you robbed the robbers, and now the robbers
are after you.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: That’s it. In a nutshell.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yeah, well, you have to be nuts to do what you
did. If you want my opinion, you should give this money back to the
Creeper. Just give it back and tell him you’re sorry.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: No way. There’s no way I’m giving that money
back. It’s my money now.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: A lot of good it will do you if the Creeper
finds you.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: That money is my whole future.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Keep up with that attitude, and you won’t have
a future. Seventeen is a hell of an age to die. Is that what you
want?</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: I’ll be back in about an hour. Watch the
register while I’m gone, okay?</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Sure thing. See you later.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Jesus God, save me.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: It might be illegal, but it’s hard to see
where the crime is if there’s no victim. No harm done, right?</p>
<p><strong>first lawyer</strong>: This is what it must have felt like to
go to a speakeasy during Prohibition</p>
<p><strong>second lawyer</strong>: Forbidden pleasures, eh?</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Much business while I was gone?</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: A little. Not much.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: This way, gentlemen. Let’s retire to my
office, shall we?</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: What the fuck is going on here! Look at
this! The goddamn place is flooded! Holy fucking shit! Look at this!
Look at this goddamn mess!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: So you lost the job. Is that what you’re
telling me? He just up and fired you?</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: It was more complicated than that. There was
a reason.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: It wasn’t my fault.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: If you don’t tell me what happened, how do you
expect me to know that? I need facts, not opinions.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: The water was dripping, see… I turned it
off, but it was still dripping, and then Auggie had to go out, and so I
left the back room … And later on … well, later on … when Auggie came
back … the whole place was flooded. His Cuban cigars got all messed up …
You know, soaked through … just when he was about to sell them … to
these rich guys in suits….</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Cuban cigars. You mean he had some hanky-panky
going with those guys?</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: I suppose so. He never told me about it.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No wonder he was angry.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: He was out five thousand bucks, he said…. He
kept saying it over and over…. Five thousand bucks down the drain…. He
wouldn’t stop…. Five thousand bucks, five thousand bucks…. He was like
out of his mind with those five thousand bucks….</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Here’s what you’re going to do. You’re going
to open up your backpack, take out your bag of money, count out five
thousand dollars, and hand it over to Auggie.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: What are you talking about? You can’t be
serious.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m serious, all right. You’ve got to square
it with Auggie. Since you won’t give the money back to the Creeper, you
can use it to make things right with Auggie. That’s probably better
anyway. Better to keep your friends than to worry about your
enemies.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: I’m not going to do it.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You’ll do it, all right. You fuck up, you’ve
got to undo the damage. That’s how it works, buster. If you don’t do it,
I’m going to throw you out of here. Do you understand me? If you don’t
pay Auggie what you owe him. I’m finished with you.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: I pay Auggie, and I’ve got nothing. Eight
hundred bucks and a ticket to Shit City.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Don’t worry about it. You’ve got friends now,
remember? Just behave yourself, and everything will work out.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: The kid’s sorry, Auggie.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Yeah, well, I’m sorry too. It took me three
years to save up those five thousand bucks, and now I’m broke. I can’t
hardly pay for this beer. Not to speak of having my credibility
destroyed. Do you understand what I’m saying? My credibility. So yeah,
I’m sorry, too. About as sorry as I’ve ever been in my whole fucking
life.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: He’s got something to tell you, Auggie.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: If he’s got something to tell me, why don’t
he tell it to me himself?</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: It’s for you.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: For me? And what am I supposed to do with a
paper bag?</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Open it.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: What is this, some kind of joke?</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: No, it’s five thousand dollars.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Shit. I don’t want your money, you little
twerp. It’s probably stolen anyway.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: What do you care where it comes from? It’s
yours.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: And why the hell would you give me
money?</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: So I can get my job back.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Your job? You’ve got five thousand bucks.
What do you want a piece-of-shit job like that for?</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: To look at the dirty magazines. I can see
all the naked women I want, and it doesn’t cost me a cent.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: You’re a dumb, whacked-out little fuck, do
you know that?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Don’t be an ass, Auggie. He’s trying to make
it up to you, can’t you see that?</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: He’s crazy.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No, he’s not. You are.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: You’re right. I just wasn’t sure you
knew.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It’s written all over you like a neon sign.
Now say something nice to Rashid to make him feel better.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Fuck you, kid.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Fuck you, too, you white son-of-a-bitch.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Good. I’m glad that’s settled!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Pay attention, boys. Look sharp.</p>
<p><strong>creeper</strong>: Mr. Benjamin, I presume?</p>
<p><strong>goodwin</strong>: You got a security problem in this
building, you know that? The lock on that door downstairs is busted.</p>
<p><strong>creeper</strong>: Not a good idea in these troubled times.
You never know what kind of trash might wander in off the streets.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’ll talk to the landlord about it
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>goodwin</strong>: You do that. Don’t want no unpleasant
surprises, do you?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: And who do I have the pleasure of talking to
now?</p>
<p><strong>creeper</strong>: Pleasure? I wouldn’t call this pleasure,
funny man. I’d say it’s more in the nature of business.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It doesn’t matter. I know who you are anyway.
You’re the Creeper, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>creeper</strong>: The what?</p>
<p><strong>goodwin</strong>: Ain’t nobody calls Charles by that name to
his face. Understand?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Sure, I understand.</p>
<p><strong>creeper</strong>: Let me tell you the business we’re here
about. We want your cooperation in helping us locate a certain party. We
know he’s been staying here, so we don’t want no denials about it,
understand?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What party are you looking for?</p>
<p><strong>goodwin</strong>: Little Tommy Cole. A homeboy with a brain
the size of a pea.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Tommy Cole? Never heard of him.</p>
<p><strong>creeper</strong>: I’m not sure you heard me the first time.
We know that boy’s been here.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You might think you know, but you’ve got the
wrong information. I never heard of anyone named Tommy Cole.</p>
<p><strong>goodwin</strong>: Lookee here, Charles. Ain’t cousin Tommy
fond of doodling?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hey, what the hell are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>creeper</strong>: So what’s it going to be, funny man? Do you
cooperate, or do we send you to the hospital?</p>
<p><strong>goodwin</strong>: Hope you got some good Blue Cross,
baby.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: … If it happens, it happens. If it doesn’t,
it doesn’t. Do you understand what I’m saying? You never know what’s
going to happen next, and the moment you think you know, that’s the
moment you don’t know a goddamn thing. That’s what we call a paradox.
Are you following me?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Sure, Auggie. I follow. When you don’t know
nothing, it’s like paradise. I know what that is. It’s after you’re dead
and you go up to heaven and sit with the angels.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Jesus, man, you’re one fucking mess.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It could have been worse. If the cops hadn’t
come, I might not be standing here now.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Cops? You mean they nabbed those cruds?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No. The … uh … the Bobbsey Twins lit out when
they heard the sirens. But at least they stopped playing that marimba
duet on my skull. Assaultus interruptus.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Fuckus my assus. They did some number on
you.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: For once in my life I managed to keep my mouth
shut. There’s something to be said for that, I suppose.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Does it hurt?</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Of course it hurts. What does it look
like?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I thought maybe he was pretending.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You haven’t heard from Rashid, have you?</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Not a peep.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I spoke to his aunt a couple of days ago, but
she hasn’t heard from him either. It’s beginning to get a little
scary.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: That could be a good sign, though. It could
mean that he got away.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Or didn’t. There’s no way of knowing, is
there?</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: What the fuck you want, mister?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m sorry. I thought you were someone
else.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: I ain’t someone else, got it? You can go
fuck yourself with your someone else.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: So you’re just going to give up and go
home?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: I don’t have much choice, do I? It’s pretty
clear she doesn’t want me around.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Still, you can’t just write her off.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Yeah? And what else am I supposed to do?
There’s no baby anymore, and if she wants to throw away her life, that’s
her business.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: She’s just a kid. There’s time for more
babies later. After she grows up.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Dream on, Auggie. She’ll be lucky to make it
to her nineteenth birthday.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Not if you got her into one of those rehab
programs.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: I’d never be able to talk her into it. And
even if I could, those things cost money. And that’s just what I don’t
have. I’m flat out dead broke.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: No you’re not.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Are you calling me a liar? I’m telling you I’m
broke. I don’t even have insurance on my goddamned car.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Remember that business venture I was telling
you about? Well, my tugboat came in. I’m flush.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Bully for you.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: No, bully for you.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Why don’t you open it and find out?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Jesus God, Auggie. There’s money in here.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Five thousand bucks.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: And you’re giving it to me?</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: It’s all yours, baby.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: For keeps?</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: For keeps.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: I can’t believe it. Oh God, I can’t believe
it. You’re an angel, Auggie. An angel from heaven.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Fuck this angel shit. Just take the dough,
Ruby. But no bawling, okay? I can’t stand people who blubber.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: I’m sorry, baby. I can’t help it.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: There’s just one thing I want to know.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Anything, Auggie. Just name it.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Felicity. She’s not my daughter, is she?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: I don’t know, Auggie. She might be. Then
again, she might not. Mathematically speaking, there’s a fifty-fifty
chance. It’s your call.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Jesus, what happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It looks worse than it is. I’m okay.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’ll tell you all about it… … but not
here.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: It’s been a while. I thought maybe you’d be
in touch.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yeah, well, I’ve sort of been out of
commission. How’s Melville?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Almost done. A week or ten days, and I’ll be
there.</p>
<p><strong>customer</strong>: Miss, could I have my change, please?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Oh, I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>customer</strong>: And my book.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I finished my story. I thought you might want
to take a look at it.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: I’d love to.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Good. I hope you like it. It was a long time
in coming.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: I get off for lunch in ten minutes. Can I
treat you to a hamburger?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Uh … actually, it might be better if you read
the story first. Call me when you’re finished, okay?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Okay. I’ll read it tonight and call you
tomorrow. It doesn’t seem to be too long.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Forty-one pages.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: I won’t forget. I promise.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Bureau of Missing Persons. Sergeant Fosdick.
Well, blow me down. Peter Rabbit’s alive. Yeah, that’s cool. No problem.
Danzinger Road, Peekskill. Yeah, I got it. I don’t need no pencil. How
the hell do I know? I can’t help it if he’s not answering his phone. So
you’re the one who called the cops, huh? Good work. Yeah, I mean it.
Good work. It probably saved his skin. You got that right. Bad. You owe
him a lot, keemosabbe. No, not tomorrow. I have to work, chuckle brain –
remember? No, not Saturday either. Sunday. Yeah. Right. Okay. Yeah, and
kiss my ass, too. You, too.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: So what did he say when he called?</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Nothing much. He said his socks and
underpants were dirty, and would we mind driving up with his things.
Fucking kids, huh? They take you for granted every time.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Nice machine, Auggie. Where’d you find it?</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: It’s Tommy’s. The sucker owed me a
favor.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It’s not a long drive. An hour, an hour and a
half. We’ll be back in time for dinner.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: We’d better be. I haven’t spent a night out
of Brooklyn in fourteen years, and I’m not about to break my record now.
Besides, I’ve got to be on my corner at eight sharp tomorrow
morning.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Oh, Jesus. What are they doing here on
Sunday?</p>
<p><strong>doreen</strong>: Hi, Paul. We decided to have a picnic. Want
to join us?</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Uh, yeah, sure. Just a minute. I’ll be down
in a minute.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Jesus Christ!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hi, kid.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Wow. They sure did a job on you.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Research. I worked the scene right into my
story. That makes the medical bills one hundred percent tax
deductible.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Try selling that one to the IRS.</p>
<p><strong>cyrus</strong>: You know these men? I thought we had some
customers.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Yeah, he knows us. But you’ve also got some
customers. Fucking Tommy. Leave it to him to drive around with bald
tires.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: We came here to deliver some clean
laundry.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: It’s all right. I really do know them.</p>
<p><strong>cyrus</strong>: I’m the owner here. Cyrus Cole.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Augustus Wren.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Paul Benjamin.</p>
<p><strong>cyrus</strong>: That’s funny. His name is the same as
yours.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Well, you and Junior have the same name,
too, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>cyrus</strong>: Yeah, but he’s my son. Nothing strange about
that. He’s my own flesh and blood. But here you got the same name as
this man here, and you’re not even the same color.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: That’s how we met. We’re members of the
International Same Name Club. Believe it or not, there are 846 Paul
Benjamins in America. But only two in the New York metropolitan area.
That’s how Paul and I got to be such good friends. We’re the only ones
who show up at the meetings.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: You’re full of crap, kid. Why don’t you just
come clean and tell the man who you are?</p>
<p><strong>cyrus</strong>: What the hell’s going on, mister?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You better ask him.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Yeah, Rashid baby, spill it.</p>
<p><strong>doreen</strong>: Rashid?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Sometimes. It’s what you’d call a nom de
guerre.</p>
<p><strong>cyrus</strong>: What the hell are we talking about?</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Come on. Tell him your real name. The name
on your birth certificate.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Thomas.</p>
<p><strong>cyrus</strong>: Paul. Rashid. Thomas. Which one is it?</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Thomas.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Come on, come on, you yellow belly. The
whole thing. First name and last name.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: What difference does it make?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: If it doesn’t make any difference, why not
just say it?</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: I was going to tell him … but in my own
time. In my own time… .</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: No time like the present, man.</p>
<p><strong>cyrus</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Thomas Cole. My name is Thomas Jefferson
Cole.</p>
<p><strong>cyrus</strong>: Are you making fun of me? I won’t be mocked.
Do you hear me? I won’t let no punk kid stand there and mock me!</p>
<p><strong>doreen</strong>: Cyrus!</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: Dada.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Like it or not, Cyrus, that’s my name. Cole.
Just like yours.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Now ask him who his mother was.</p>
<p><strong>cyrus</strong>: I don’t like this. I don’t like it one
bit.</p>
<p><strong>rashid</strong>: Louisa Vail. Remember her, Cyrus?</p>
<p><strong>cyrus</strong>: You shut your mouth! You shut your mouth
now!</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Hey, cut it out!</p>
<p><strong>doreen</strong>: Damn you. There’ll be none of that on my
watch, you dumpy bag of shit.</p>
<p><strong>doreen</strong>: … It might not have been the smartest
investment, but it didn’t cost much, and if Cyrus can make a go of it,
we’ll be able to take care of our needs. The man knows his way around
cars, I’ll tell you that, but the problem is this road is too far off
the beaten track. Ever since they put in that mall, the traffic hasn’t
been too heavy around here. But you take the good with the bad, right?
You do your best and hope that things work out…</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Of course there’s gonna be a war. You think
they’d send five hundred thousand troops over there just to lie in the
sun? I mean, there’s plenty of beach, but not a hell of a lot of water.
Half a million soldiers. It ain’t no seaside holiday, you can bet on
that.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I don’t know, Tommy. You think anyone gives a
rat’s ass about Kuwait? I read something about the head sheik over
there. He marries a different virgin every Friday and then divorces her
on Monday. You think we want to have our kids dying for a guy like
that?</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: That’s one way of upholding American values,
eh, Tommy?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Laugh all you want. I’m telling you there’s
gonna be a war. With things in Russia falling apart, those slobs in the
Pentagon’ll be out of work unless they find a new enemy. They got this
Saddam character now, and they’re going to hit him with all they’ve got.
Mark my words.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Hey, man, how’s it going?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hi, Auggie.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Two, right?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Uh, better make it one.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: You usually get two.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yeah, I know, but I’m trying to cut down.
Somebody’s worried about my health.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Ah-hah.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Fine. Or it was until a couple of days ago. A
guy from The New York Times called and asked me to write a Christmas
story. They want to publish it on Christmas Day.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: That’s a feather in your cap, man. The paper
of record.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yeah, great. The problem is, I have four days
to come up with something, and I don’t have a single idea. You know
anything about Christmas stories?</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Christmas stories? Sure, I know a ton of
’em.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Anything good?</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Good? Of course. Are you kidding? I’ll tell
you what. Buy me lunch, my friend, and I’ll tell you the best Christmas
story you ever heard. How’s that? And I guarantee every word of it is
true.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It doesn’t have to be true. It just has to be
good.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Take over the register while I’m gone, okay,
Jimmy?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy rose</strong>: You want me to do it, Auggie? You sure
you want me to do it?</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Sure I’m sure. Just remember what I taught
you. And don’t let any of these kibitzers cause you trouble. You got a
problem, you come and see me. I’ll be down the block at Jack’s. Jack’s
okay?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Jack’s is fine.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I have to pee. If the waiter comes, order me a
corned beef on rye and a ginger ale, okay?</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: You got it.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: What’ll it be, Auggie?</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Uh… My friend over here would like a corned
beef on rye and a ginger ale.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: And what about for you?</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: What about for you?</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: For me? I’ll have the same thing.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Do me a favor, will you?</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: What’s that, Sol?</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Next time, when you want two corned beef
sandwiches, say, “Two corned beef sandwiches.” When you want two ginger
ales, say, “Two ginger ales.”</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: What’s the difference?</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: It’s simpler, that’s what. It makes things
go faster.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Uh, sure, Sol. Anything you say. Instead of
saying, “One corned beef sandwich,” and then, “Another corned beef
sandwich,” I’ll say, “Two corned beef sandwiches.”</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Thanks. I knew you’d understand.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: So. Are we ready?</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Ready. Any time you are.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m all ears.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Okay. You remember how you once asked me how
I started taking pictures? Well, this is the story of how I got my first
camera. As a matter of fact, it’s the only camera I’ve ever had. Are you
following me so far?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Every word.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Okay. So this is the story of how it
happened. Okay. It was the summer of ’seventy-six, back when I first
started working for Vinnie. The summer of the bicentennial. A kid came
in one morning and started stealing things from the store. He’s standing
by the rack of paperbacks near the front window stuffing skin magazines
under his shirt. It was crowded around the counter just then, so I
didn’t see him at first….</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: But once I noticed what he was up to, I
started to shout. He took off like a jackrabbit, and by the time I
managed to get out from behind the counter, he was already tearing down
Seventh Avenue. I chased after him for about half a block, and then I
gave up. He’d dropped something along the way, and since I didn’t feel
like running anymore, I bent down to see what it was.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: It turned out to be his wallet. There wasn’t
any money inside, but his driver’s license was there, along with three
or four snapshots. I suppose I could have called the cops and had him
arrested. I had his name and address from the license, but I felt kind
of sorry for him. He was just a measly little punk, and once I looked at
those pictures in his wallet, I couldn’t bring myself to feel very angry
at him….</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Roger Goodwin. That was his name. In one of
the pictures, I remember, he was standing next to his mother. In another
one, he was holding some trophy he got from school and smiling like he
just won the Irish Sweepstakes. I just didn’t have the heart. A poor kid
from Brooklyn without much going for him, and who cared about a couple
of dirty magazines, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Here you go, boys. Two corned beef
sandwiches. Two ginger ales. The fast way. The simple way.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: So I held onto the wallet. Every once in a
while I’d get a little urge to send it back to him, but I kept delaying
and never did anything about it. Then Christmas rolls around, and I’m
stuck with nothing to do. Vinnie was going to invite me over, but his
mother got sick, and he and his wife had to go down to Florida at the
last minute. So I’m sitting in my apartment that morning, feeling a
little sorry for myself, and then I see Roger Goodwin’s wallet lying on
a shelf in the kitchen. I figure what the hell, why not do something
nice for once, and I put on my coat and go out to return the wallet…
.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: The address was over in Boerum Hill,
somewhere in the projects. It was freezing out that day, and I remember
getting lost a few times trying to find the right building. Everything
looks the same in that place, and you keep going over the same ground
thinking you’re somewhere else. Anyway, I finally get to the apartment
I’m looking for and ring the bell…</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Nothing happens. I assume no one’s there,
but I try again just to make sure. I wait a little longer, and just when
I’m about to give up, I hear someone shuffling to the door. An old
woman’s voice asks, “Who’s there?” and I say I’m looking for Roger
Goodwin. “Is that you, Roger?” the old woman says, and then she undoes
about fifteen locks and opens the door….</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: She has to be at least eighty, maybe ninety
years old, and the first thing I notice about her is she’s blind. “I
knew you’d come. Roger,” she says. “I knew you wouldn’t forget your
Granny Ethel on Christmas.” And then she opens her arms as if she’s
about to hug me.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: I don’t have much time to think, you
understand. I had to say something real fast, and before I knew what was
happening, I could hear the words coming out of my mouth. “That’s right,
Granny Ethel,” I said. “I came back to see you on Christmas.” Don’t ask
me why I did it. I don’t have any idea. It just came out that way, and
suddenly this old woman’s hugging me there in front of the door, and I’m
hugging her back. It was like a game we both decided to play – without
having to discuss the rules. I mean, that woman knew I wasn’t her
grandson. She was old and dotty, but she wasn’t so far gone that she
couldn’t tell the difference between a stranger and her own flesh and
blood. But it made her happy to pretend, and since I had nothing better
to do anyway, I was happy to go along with her….</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: So we went into the apartment and spent the
day together. Every time she asked me a question about how I was, I
would lie to her. I told her I’d found a good job in a cigar store. I
told her I was about to get married. I told her a hundred pretty
stories, and she made like she believed every one of them. “That’s fine,
Roger,” she would say, nodding her head and smiling. “I always knew
things would work out for you….”</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: After a while, I started getting hungry.
There didn’t seem to be much food in the house, so I went out to a store
in the neighborhood and brought back a mess of stuff. A precooked
chicken, vegetable soup, a bucket of potato salad, all kinds of things.
Ethel had a couple of bottles of wine stashed in her bedroom, and so
between us we managed to put together a fairly decent Christmas
dinner….</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: We both got a little tipsy from the wine, I
remember, and after the meal was over we went out to sit in the living
room where the chairs were more comfortable…</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: I had to take a pee, so I excused myself and
went to the bathroom down the hall. That’s where things took another
turn. It was ditsy enough doing my little jig as Ethel’s grandson, but
what I did next was positively crazy, and I’ve never forgiven myself for
it….</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: I go into the bathroom, and stacked up
against the wall next to the shower, I see a pile of six or seven
cameras. Brand-new, thirty-five millimeter cameras, still in their
boxes. I figure this is the work of the real Roger, a storage place for
one of his recent hauls. I’ve never taken a picture in my life, and I’ve
certainly never stolen anything, but the moment I see those cameras
sitting in the bathroom, I decide I want one of them for myself. Just
like that. And without even stopping to think about it, I tuck one of
the boxes under my arm and go back to the living room….</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: I couldn’t have been gone for more than
three minutes, but in that time Granny Ethel had fallen asleep. Too much
Chianti, I suppose. I went into the kitchen to wash the dishes, and she
slept on through the whole racket, snoring like a baby. There didn’t
seem to be any point in disturbing her, so I decided to leave. I
couldn’t even write a note to say good-bye, seeing that she was blind
and all, so I just left. I put her grandson’s wallet on the table,
picked up the camera again, and walked out of the apartment… .</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: And that’s the end of the story.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Did you ever go back to see her?</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Once, about three or four months later. I
felt so bad about stealing the camera, I hadn’t even used it yet. I
finally made up my mind to return it, but Granny Ethel wasn’t there
anymore. Someone else had moved into the apartment, and he couldn’t tell
me where she was.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: She probably died.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Yeah, probably.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Which means that she spent her last Christmas
with you.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: I guess so. I never thought of it that
way.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It was a good deed, Auggie. It was a nice
thing you did for her.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: I lied to her, and then I stole from her. I
don’t see how you can call that a good deed.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You made her happy. And the camera was stolen
anyway. It’s not as if the person you took it from really owned it.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Anything for art, eh, Paul?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I wouldn’t say that. But at least you’ve put
the camera to good use.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: And now you’ve got your Christmas story,
don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yes, I suppose I do.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I mean, it’s a good story.</p>
<p><strong>auggie</strong>: Shit. If you can’t share your secrets with
your friends, what kind of friend are you?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Exactly. Life just wouldn’t be worth living,
would it?</p>
