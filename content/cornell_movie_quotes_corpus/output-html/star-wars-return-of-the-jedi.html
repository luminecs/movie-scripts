<p><strong>2 int imperial shuttle - cockpit</strong>: The shuttle
captain makes contact with the Death Star.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle captain</strong>: Command station, this is ST 321.
Code Clearance Blue. We’re starting our approach. Deactivate the
security shield.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle captain</strong>: We’re starting our approach.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Inform the commander that Lord Vader’s
shuttle has arrived.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>jerjerrod</strong>: Lord Vader, this is an unexpected
pleasure. We’re honored by your presence.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: You may dispense with the pleasantries,
Commander. I’m here to put you back on schedule.</p>
<p><strong>jerjerrod</strong>: I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are
working as fast as they can.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate
them.</p>
<p><strong>jerjerrod</strong>: I tell you, this station will be
operational as planned.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: The Emperor does not share your optimistic
appraisal of the situation.</p>
<p><strong>jerjerrod</strong>: But he asks the impossible. I need more
men.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: Then perhaps you can tell him when he
arrives.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: That is correct, Commander. And he is most
displeased with your apparent lack of progress.</p>
<p><strong>jerjerrod</strong>: We shall double our efforts.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The
Emperor is not as forgiving as I am.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Of course I’m worried. And you should be,
too. Lando Calrissian and poor Chewbacca never returned from this awful
place.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Don’t be so sure. If I told you half the
things I’ve heard about this Jabba the Hutt, you’d probably
short-circuit.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Artoo, are you sure this is the right
place? I better knock, I suppose.</p>
<p><strong>strange voice</strong>: Tee chuta hhat yudd!</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Goodness gracious me!</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Artoo Detoowha bo Seethreepiowha ey toota
odd mischka Jabba du Hutt.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: I don’t think they’re going to let us in,
Artoo. We’d better go.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Artoo, wait. Oh, dear! Artoo. Artoo, I
really don’t think we should rush into all this.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Oh, Artoo! Artoo, wait for me!</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Just you deliver Master Luke’s message and
get us out of here. Oh my! Oh! Oh, no.</p>
<p><strong>bib</strong>: Die Wanna Wanga!</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Oh, my! Die Wanna Wauaga. We – we bring a
message to your master, Jabba the Hutt.</p>
<p><strong>bib</strong>: Nee Jabba no badda. Me chaade su goodie.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: He says that our instructions are to give
it only to Jabba himself.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: I’m terribly sorry. I’m afraid he’s ever
so stubborn about these sort of things.</p>
<p><strong>bib</strong>: Nudd Chaa.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Artoo, I have a bad feeling about
this.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>jabba</strong>: Bo Shuda!</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: The message, Artoo, the message.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Greetings, Exalted One. Allow me to introduce
myself. I am Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight and friend to Captain Solo. I
know that you are powerful, mighty Jabba, and that your anger with Solo
must be equally powerful. I seek an audience with Your Greatness to
bargain for Solo’s life. With your wisdom, I’m sure that we can work out
an arrangement which will be mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid
any unpleasant confrontation. As a token of my goodwill, I present to
you a gift: these two droids.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: What did he say?</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: This can’t be! Artoo, you’re playing the
wrong message.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: We’re doomed.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Artoo, look! Captain Solo. And he’s still
frozen in carbonite.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: What could possibly have come over Master
Luke. Is it something I did? He never expressed any unhappiness with my
work. Oh! Oh! Hold it! Ohh!</p>
<p><strong>ninedenine</strong>: Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a
protocol droid, are you not?</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: I am See-Threepio, human-cy…</p>
<p><strong>ninedenine</strong>: Yes or no will do.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Oh. Well, yes.</p>
<p><strong>ninedenine</strong>: How many languages do you speak?</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: I am fluent in over six million forms of
communication, and can readily…</p>
<p><strong>ninedenine</strong>: Splendid! We have been without an
interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and
disintegrated him.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Disintegrated?</p>
<p><strong>ninedenine</strong>: You’re a feisty little one, but you’ll
soon learn some respect. I have need for you on the master’s Sail Barge.
And I think you’ll fit in nicely.</p>
<p><strong>jabba</strong>: Da Eitha!</p>
<p><strong>oola</strong>: Na Chuba negatorie Na! Na! Natoota…</p>
<p><strong>jabba</strong>: Boscka!</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Oh, no! Chewbacca!</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Oh, uh, yes, uh, I am here, Your
Worshipfulness. Uh… yes!</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Oh. The illustrious Jabba bids you welcome
and will gladly pay you the reward of twenty-five thousand.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Uh, oh… but what, what did I say? Uh, the
mighty Jabba asks why he must pay fifty thousand.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Because he’s holding a thermal
detonator.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Jabba offers the sum of thirty-five. And I
suggest you take it.</p>
<p><strong>boushh</strong>: Zeebuss.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: He agrees!</p>
<p><strong>boushh</strong>: Just relax for a moment. You’re free of the
carbonite.</p>
<p><strong>boushh</strong>: Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: I can’t see.</p>
<p><strong>boushh</strong>: Your eyesight will return in time.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Where am I?</p>
<p><strong>boushh</strong>: Jabba’s palace.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Someone who loves you.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Leia!</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: I gotta get you out of here.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: What’s that? I know that laugh.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Hey, Jabba. Look, Jabba, I was just on my way
to pay you back, but I got a little sidetracked. It’s not my fault.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Look…</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Jabba… I’ll pay you triple! You’re throwing
away a fortune here. Don’t be a fool!</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: We have powerful friends. You’re gonna regret
this…</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Ugh!</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Ohhh, I can’t bear to watch.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Chewie? Chewie, is that you?</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Ah! Chew–Chewie!</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Wait. I can’t see, pal. What’s goin’ on?</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Luke? Luke’s crazy. He can’t even take care of
himself, much less rescue anybody.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: A…Jedi Knight? I–I’m out of it for a little
while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: I’m all right, pal. I’m all right.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I must speak with Jabba.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: You will take me to Jabba now!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: You serve your master well.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: And you will be rewarded.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: At last! Master Luke’s come to rescue
me.</p>
<p><strong>bib</strong>: Master.</p>
<p><strong>bib</strong>: …Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I must be allowed to speak.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: You will bring Captain Solo and the Wookiee to
me.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Nevertheless, I’m taking Captain Solo and his
friends. You can either profit by this… or be destroyed! It’s your
choice. But I warn you not to underestimate my powers.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Master Luke, you’re standing on…</p>
<p><strong>jabba</strong>: Bascka!</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Oh, no! The Rancor!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Han!</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Luke!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Fine. Together again, huh?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Wouldn’t miss it.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: How are we doing?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: The same as always.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: That bad, huh? Where’s Leia?</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great
Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated
immediately.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Good, I hate long waits.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: You will therefore be taken to the Dune
Sea and cast into the pit of Carkoon, the nesting place of the
all-powerful Sarlacc.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: In his belly, you will find a new
definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a
thousand years.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: On second thought, let’s pass on that, huh?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: You should have bargained, Jabba. That’s the
last mistake you’ll ever make.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of
a big dark blur, I see a big light blur.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: There’s nothing to see. I used to live here,
you know.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: You’re gonna die here, you know.
Convenient.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I’ve
taken care of everything.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Oh… great!</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Oh, I’m terribly sor… Artoo! What are you
doing here?</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Well, I can see you’re serving drinks, but
this place is dangerous. They’re going to execute Master Luke and, if
we’re not careful, us too!</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Hmm. I wish I had your confidence.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Victims of the almighty Sarlacc: His
Excellency hopes that you will die honorably. But should any of you wish
to beg for mercy, the great Jabba the Hutt will now listen to your
pleas.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Threepio, you tell that slimy piece of…
worm-ridden filth he’ll get no such pleasure from us. Right?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Jabba! This is your last chance. Free us or
die.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Easy, Chewie.</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: Whoa! Whoa! Help!</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Chewie, you okay? Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: I’m okay, pal.</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: Han! Chewie?</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Lando!</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where?</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Lando, grab it!</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: Lower it!</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: I’m trying!</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Whoa! Whoa! Grab me, Chewie! I’m slipping.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Grab it! L–Lando. Grab!</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Grab it! Almost… You almost got it!</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: Hold it! Whoa!</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Gently now. All… all right. Now easy, easy.
Hold me, Chewie.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don’t move,
Lando.</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: No, wait! I thought you were blind!</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: It’s all right. Trust me. Don’t move.</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: All right! A little higher! Just a little
higher!</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Chewie, Pull us up! Come on! Okay… up, Chewie,
up!</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Come on. We gotta get out of here quick.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Not my eyes! Artoo, help! Quickly, Artoo.
Oh! Ohhh! You beast!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Point it at the deck!</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Artoo, where are we going? I couldn’t
possibly jump.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Come on!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Let’s go! And don’t forget the droids.</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: We’re on our way.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: I don’t know. All I can see is a lot of blowing
sand!</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: That’s all any of us can see.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: No, I’m thinking a lot about it. That carbon
freeze was the closest thing to dead there is. And it wasn’t just
sleepin’. It was a big wide awake nothing!</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Why don’t you leave that crate and come with
us?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I have a promise I have to keep first… to an
old friend.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando.</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: Figured if I left you frozen like that you’d
just give me bad luck the rest of my life, so I might as well get you
unfrozen sooner or later.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: He means “You’re welcome.”</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: Come on, let’s get off this miserable dust
ball.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I’ll meet you back at the fleet.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I will.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: That’s right, Artoo. We’re going to the
Dagobah system. I have a promise to keep… to an old friend.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: The Death Star will be completed on
schedule.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I
sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: Yes, my Master.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: Patience, my friend. In time he will seek
you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown
strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: As you wish.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: Everything is proceeding as I have
foreseen.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Hmm. That face you make. Look I so old to
young eyes?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: No… of course not.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Soon will I rest. Yes, forever sleep. Earned
it, I have.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Master Yoda, you can’t die.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Strong am I with the Force… but not that
strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of
things… the way of the Force.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: But I need your help. I’ve come back to
complete the training.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: No more training do you require. Already know
you that which you need.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Then I am a Jedi?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Master Yoda… is Darth Vader my father?</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Mmm… rest I need. Yes… rest.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Yoda, I must know.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Your father he is.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Told you, did he?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Unexpected this is, and unfortunate…</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Unfortunate that I know the truth?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Well, I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Remember, a Jedi’s strength flows from the
Force. But beware. Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they. Once
you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Luke…Luke…Do not…Do not underestimate the
powers of the Emperor, or suffer your father’s fate, you will. Luke,
when gone am I , the last of the Jedi will you be. Luke, the Force runs
strong in your family. Pass on what you have learned, Luke… There
is…another…Sky…Sky…walker.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I can’t do it, Artoo. I can’t go on alone.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yoda will always be with you.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Obi-Wan! Why didn’t you tell me?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my
father.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You father was seduced by the dark side of the
Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When
that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I
have told you was true… from a certain point of view.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Luke, you’re going to find that many of the
truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I don’t blame you for being angry. If I was
wrong in what I did, it certainly wouldn’t have been for the first time.
You see, what happened to your father was my fault.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Anakin was a good friend.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: When I first knew him, your father was already
a great pilot. But I was amazed how strongly the Force was with him. I
took it upon myself to train him as a Jedi. I thought that I could
instruct him just as well as Yoda. I was wrong. My pride has had
terrible consequences for the galaxy.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: There’s still good in him.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I also thought he could be turned back to the
good side. It couldn’t be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted
and evil.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I can’t do it, Ben.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You cannot escape your destiny.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I tried to stop him once. I couldn’t do
it.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke…
but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among
other things, the value of patience. Had you not been so impatient to
defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda.
You would have been prepared.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: But I had to help my friends.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then
go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn’t get past.
Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. Only, your
father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and
you have held firm. You’re no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are
strong and patient. And now, you must face Darth Vader again!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I can’t kill my own father.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Then the Emperor has already won. You were our
only hope.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Yoda spoke of another.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: The other he spoke of is your twin sister.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: But I have no sister.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you
were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I
did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to
him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Leia! Leia’s my sister.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Your insight serves you well. Bury your
feelings deep down, Luke. They do you credit. But they could be made to
serve the Emperor.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: But you can’t let her get involved now, Ben.
Vader will destroy her.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: She hasn’t been trained in the ways of the Jedi
the way you have, Luke… but the Force is strong with her, as it is with
all of your family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and
destroy Vader!</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Well, look at you, a general, huh?</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: Oh, well, someone must have told them about
my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Well, who says they didn’t. But I ain’t crazy.
You’re the respectable one, remember?</p>
<p><strong>mon mothma</strong>: The Emperor has made a critical error
and the time for our attack has come.</p>
<p><strong>mon mothma</strong>: The data brought to us by the Bothan
spies pinpoints the exact location of the Emperor’s new battle station.
We also know that the weapon systems of this Death Star are not yet
operational. With the Imperial Fleet spread throughout the galaxy in a
vain effort to engage us, it is relatively unprotected. But most
important of all, we’ve learned that the Emperor himself is personally
overseeing the final stages of the construction of this Death Star.</p>
<p><strong>ackbar</strong>: You can see here the Death Star orbiting the
forest Moon of Endor. Although the weapon systems on this Death Star are
not yet operational, the Death Star does have a strong defense
mechanism. It is protected by an energy shield, which is generated from
the nearby forest Moon of Endor. The shield must be deactivated if any
attack is to be attempted. Once the shield is down, our cruisers will
create a perimeter, while the fighters fly into the superstructure and
attempt to knock out the main reactor.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: You’re gonna need it.</p>
<p><strong>ackbar</strong>: General Madine.</p>
<p><strong>general madine</strong>: We have stolen a small Imperial
shuttle. Disguised as a cargo ship, and using a secret Imperial code, a
strike team will land on the moon and deactivate the shield
generator.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Sounds dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>general madine</strong>: General Solo, is your strike team
assembled?</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Uh, my team’s ready. I don’t have a command
crew for the shuttle.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Well, it’s gonna be rough, pal. I didn’t want
to speak for you.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Uh, General… count me in.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I’m with you, too!</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Luke.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Hi, Han… Chewie.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: “Exciting” is hardly the word I would
use.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take
her. You need all the help you can get. She’s the fastest ship in the
fleet.</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: All right, old buddy. You know, I know what
she means to you. I’ll take good care of her. She-she won’t get a
scratch. All right?</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: Look, would you get going, you pirate.</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: You, too.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: You got her warmed?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Yeah, she’s comin’ up.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: No. I don’t think the Empire had Wookiees in
mind when they designed her, Chewie.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Hey, are you awake?</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I’m not
gonna see her again.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Right. Chewie, let’s see what this piece of
junk can do. Ready, everybody?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: All set.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Here we go again.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: All right, hang on.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: What is thy bidding, my Master?</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: Send the fleet to the far side of Endor.
There it will stay until called for.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: What of the reports of the Rebel fleet
massing near Sullust?</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion
will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is
finished, my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: Yes, my Master.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: If they don’t go for this, we’re gonna have to
get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the
deflector shield.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Transmission commencing.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Now we find out if that code is worth the
price we paid.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: It’ll work. It’ll work.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Vader’s on that ship.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Now don’t get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of
command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don’t look like
you’re trying to keep your distance.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: I don’t know. Fly casual.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I’m endangering the mission. I shouldn’t have
come.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: It’s your imagination, kid. Come on. Let’s keep
a little optimism here.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: Where is that shuttle going?</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: Do they have a code clearance?</p>
<p><strong>piett</strong>: It’s an older code, sir, but it checks out. I
was about to clear them.</p>
<p><strong>piett</strong>: Shall I hold them?</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: No. Leave them to me. I will deal with them
myself.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: They’re not goin’ for it, Chewie.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Okay! I told you it was gonna work. No
problem.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Oh, I told you it was dangerous here.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Shall we try and go around?</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: It’ll take time. This whole party’ll be for
nothing if they see us.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay
here.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Quietly, there might be more of them out
there.</p>
<p><strong>scout #1</strong>: Go for help! Go!</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Over there! Two more of them!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I see them. Wait, Leia!</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Hey, wait! Ahhh!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Move closer!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Get alongside that one!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Get him!</p>
<p><strong>another part of the forest</strong>: Luke and the last
remaining scout continue their weaving chase through the trees. Now Luke
moves up close. The scout responds by slamming his bike into Luke’s. A
fallen tree forms a bridge across their path. The scout zips under. Luke
goes over the top and crashes his bike down on the scout’s. Both riders
look ahead - a wide trunk looms directly in Luke’s path, but the scout’s
bike beside him makes it almost impossible for him to avoid it. Luke
banks with all his might, leaning almost horizontal over the scout’s
bike, and is able to make it by, just clipping the tree. When he
straightens, he and the scout discover that their two bikes have locked
front vanes and are moving as one.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Oh, General Solo, somebody’s coming.
Oh!</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Luke! Where’s Leia?</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: I thought she was with you.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: We got separated.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Hey, we better go look for her.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Take the squad ahead. We’ll meet at the shield
generator at 0300.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Come on, Artoo. We’ll need your scanners.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Don’t worry, Master Luke. We know what to
do.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Cut it out!</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: I’m not gonna hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Well, looks like I’m stuck here. Trouble is, I
don’t know where here is.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Well, maybe you can help me. Come on, sit
down.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: I promise I won’t hurt you. Now come here.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: All right. You want something to eat?</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: That’s right. Come on. Hmmm?</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Look, it’s a hat. It’s not gonna hurt you.
Look. You’re a jittery little thing, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>scout #1</strong>: Go get your ride and take her back to
base.</p>
<p><strong>scout #2</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Come on, let’s get outta here.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Halt! The Emperor does not wish to be
disturbed at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: The Emperor will see me, now!</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: The Emperor will see you, now.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: I told you to remain on the command
ship.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield
and landed on Endor.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: I have felt him, my Master.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your
feelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: They are clear, my Master.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and
wait for them.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: I have foreseen it. His compassion for you
will be his undoing. He will come to you and then you will bring him
before me.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Luke! Luke!</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Oh, Master Luke.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: There’s two more wrecked speeders back there.
And I found this.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: I’m afraid that Artoo’s sensors can find
no trace of Princess Leia.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: What, Chewie? What? Chewie!</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Hey, I don’t get it.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Chewie, wa-wait! Don’t!</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Nice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always
thinking with your stomach.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Will you take it easy? Let’s just figure out a
way to get out of this thing. Han, can you reach my lightsaber?</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Yeah, sure.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Artoo, I’m not sure that’s such a good
idea. It’s a very long dro-o- op!!</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Wha–? Hey! Point that thing someplace else.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Han, don’t. It’ll be all right.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Chewie, give ’em your crossbow.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Oh, my head. Oh, my goodness!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Do you understand anything they’re saying?</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Oh, yes, Master Luke! Remember that I am
fluent in over six million forms of communication.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: What are you telling them?</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Hello, I think… I could be mistaken.
They’re using a very primitive dialect. But I do believe they think I am
some sort of god.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Well, why don’t you use your divine influence
and get us out of this?</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that
just wouldn’t be proper.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Proper?!</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: It’s against my programming to impersonate
a deity.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Why, you–</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: My mistake. He’s an old friend of mine.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: I have a really bad feeling about this.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: What did he say?</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: I’m rather embarrassed, General Solo, but
it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Your Royal Highness.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: But these are my friends. Threepio, tell them
they must be set free.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Somehow, I got the feeling that didn’t help us
very much.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Threepio, tell them if they don’t do as you
wish, you’ll become angry and use your magic.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: But Master Luke, what magic? I couldn’t
possibly –</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Just tell them.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: You see, Master Luke; they didn’t believe
me. Just…</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: … as I said they wouldn’t. Wha-wha-what’s
happening! Oh! Oh, dear! Oh!</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Put me down! He-e-elp! Master Luke! Artoo!
Somebody, somebody, help! Master Luke, Artoo! Artoo, quickly! Do
something, somebody! Oh! Ohhh!</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Oh, oh, oh, oh! Thank goodness.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Thanks, Threepio.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Yes, Artoo. I was just coming to that.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Wonderful! We are now a part of the
tribe.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Just what I always wanted.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: He says the scouts are going to show us
the quickest way to the shield generator.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Good. How far is it? Ask him. We need some
fresh supplies, too. And try and get our weapons back.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Luke, what’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Leia… do you remember your mother? Your real
mother?</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Just a little bit. She died when I was very
young.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: What do you remember?</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Just…images, really. Feelings.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: She was very beautiful. Kind, but…sad. Why are
you asking me all this?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I have no memory of my mother. I never knew
her.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Luke, tell me. What’s troubling you?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Vader is here…now, on this moon.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I felt his presence. He’s come for me. He can
feel when I’m near. That’s why I have to go. As long as I stay, I’m
endangering the group and our mission here. I have to face him.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: He’s my father.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Your father?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: There’s more. It won’t be easy for you to hear
it, but you must. If I don’t make it back, you’re the only hope for the
Alliance.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Luke, don’t talk that way. You have a power
I–I don’t understand and could never have.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: You’re wrong, Leia. You have that power too.
In time you’ll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my
family. My father has it…I have it…and…my sister has it.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Yes. It’s you Leia.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: I know. Somehow…I’ve always known.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Then you know why I have to face him.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel
your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: No, you don’t. You’ve always been strong.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: But, why must you confront him?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Because…there is good in him. I’ve felt it. He
won’t turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back
to the good side. I have to try.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Hey, what’s goin’ on?</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Nothing. I - just want to be alone for a
little while.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: I…I can’t tell you.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Ahhh…</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Hold me.</p>
<p><strong>commander</strong>: This is a Rebel that surrendered to us.
Although he denies it, I believe there may be more of them, and I
request permission to conduct a further search of the area.</p>
<p><strong>commander</strong>: He was armed only with this.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: Good work, Commander. Leave us. Conduct your
search and bring his companions to me.</p>
<p><strong>commander</strong>: Yes, my Lord.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: The Emperor has been expecting you.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I know, father.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: So, you have accepted the truth.</p>
<p><strong>lure</strong>: I’ve accepted the truth that you were once
Anakin Skywalker, my father.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: It is the name of your true self. You’ve only
forgotten. I know there is good in you. The Emperor hasn’t driven it
from you fully. That is why you couldn’t destroy me. That’s why you
won’t bring me to your Emperor now.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: Your skills are complete. Indeed, you are
powerful, as the Emperor has foreseen.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Come with me.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: Obi-Wan once thought as you do.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: You don’t know the power of the dark side. I
must obey my master.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I will not turn…and you’ll be forced to kill
me.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: If that is your destiny.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Search your feelings, father. You can’t do
this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will
show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Then my father is truly dead.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: The main entrance to the control bunker’s on
the far side of that landing platform. This isn’t gonna be easy.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Hey, don’t worry. Chewie and me got into a lot
of places more heavily guarded than this.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: What’s he saying?</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: He says there’s a secret entrance on the
other side of the ridge.</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: Admiral, we’re in position. All fighters
accounted for.</p>
<p><strong>ackbar</strong>: Proceed with the countdown. All groups
assume attack coordinates.</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: Don’t worry, my friends are down there.
They’ll have that shield down on time… or this’ll be the shortest
offensive of all time.</p>
<p><strong>ackbar</strong>: All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on
my mark.</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: All right. Stand by.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Back door, huh? Good idea.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Well, it only takes one to sound the
alarm.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Quiet.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: I’m afraid our furry companion has gone
and done something rather rash.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Oh, no.</p>
<p><strong>scout</strong>: Look! Over there! Stop him!</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Not bad for a little furball. There’s only one
left. You stay here. We’ll take care of this.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: I have decided that we shall stay
here.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: Welcome, young Skywalker. I have been
expecting you.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: You no longer need those.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: Guards, leave us.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: You’re gravely mistaken. You won’t convert me
as you did my father.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that
it is you who are mistaken…about a great many things.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: His lightsaber.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: Ah, yes, a Jedi’s weapon. Much like your
father’s. By now you must know your father can never be turned from the
dark side. So will it be with you.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: You’re wrong. Soon I’ll be dead…and you with
me.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: Perhaps you refer to the imminent attack of
your Rebel fleet.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: Yes…I assure you we are quite safe from
your friends here.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Your overconfidence is your weakness.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: Your faith in your friends is yours.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: It is pointless to resist, my son.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: Oh…I’m afraid the deflector shield will be
quite operational when your friends arrive.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: All right! Up! Move! Come on! Quickly! Quickly,
Chewie.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any
moment.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Charges! Come on, come on!</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Wa-wait! Wait, come back! Artoo, stay with
me.</p>
<p><strong>commander</strong>: Freeze! You Rebel scum.</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: All wings report in.</p>
<p><strong>wedge</strong>: Red Leader standing by.</p>
<p><strong>gray leader</strong>: Gray Leader standing by.</p>
<p><strong>green leader</strong>: Green Leader standing by.</p>
<p><strong>wedge</strong>: Lock S-foils in attack positions.</p>
<p><strong>ackbar</strong>: May the Force be with us.</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: We’ve got to be able to get some kind of a
reading on that shield, up or down. Well, how could they be jamming us
if they don’t know if we’re coming.</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: Break off the attack! The shield is still
up.</p>
<p><strong>red leader</strong>: I get no reading. Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: Pull up! All craft pull up!</p>
<p><strong>ackbar</strong>: Take evasive action! Green Group, stick
close to holding sector MV-7.</p>
<p><strong>controller</strong>: Admiral, we have enemy ships in sector
47.</p>
<p><strong>ackbar</strong>: It’s a trap!</p>
<p><strong>rebel pilot</strong>: There’s too many of them!</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: Accelerate to attack speed! Draw their fire
away from the cruisers.</p>
<p><strong>wedge</strong>: Copy, Gold Leader.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: Come, boy. See for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: From here you will witness the final
destruction of the Alliance, and the end of your insignificant
Rebellion.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: You want this, don’t you? The hate is
swelling in you now. Take your Jedi weapon. Use it. I am unarmed. Strike
me down with it. Give in to your anger. With each passing moment, you
make yourself more my servant.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: It is unavoidable. It is your destiny. You,
like your father, are now mine!</p>
<p><strong>stormtrooper</strong>: All right, move it! I said move it! Go
on!</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Hello! I say, over there! Were you looking
for me?</p>
<p><strong>bunker commander</strong>: Bring those two down here!</p>
<p><strong>stormtrooper</strong>: Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Well, they’re on their way. Artoo, are you
sure this was a good idea?</p>
<p><strong>stormtrooper</strong>: Freeze! Don’t move!</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: We surrender.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Ohhh! Stand back, Artoo.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: The code’s changed. We need Artoo!</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Here’s the terminal.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Going? What do you mean, you’re going.
But– but going where, Artoo? No, what! Artoo! Oh, this is no time for
heroics. Come back!</p>
<p><strong>101 int millennium falcon - cockpit</strong>: Lando is in
radio communication with the pilots of the other Rebel squads.</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: Watch yourself, Wedge! Three from above!</p>
<p><strong>wedge</strong>: Red Three, Red Two, pull in!</p>
<p><strong>red two</strong>: Got it!</p>
<p><strong>red three</strong>: Three of them coming in, twenty
degrees!</p>
<p><strong>wedge</strong>: Cut to the left! I’ll take the leader!
They’re heading for the medical frigate.</p>
<p><strong>navigator</strong>: Pressure’s steady.</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: Only the fighters are attacking. I wonder
what those Star Destroyers are waiting for.</p>
<p><strong>commander</strong>: We’re in attack position now, sir.</p>
<p><strong>piett</strong>: Hold here.</p>
<p><strong>commander</strong>: We’re not going to attack?</p>
<p><strong>piett</strong>: I have my orders from the Emperor himself. He
has something special planned for them. We only need to keep them from
escaping.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: As you can see, my young apprentice, your
friends have failed. Now witness the firepower of this fully armed and
operational battle station. Fire at will, Commander.</p>
<p><strong>jerjerrod</strong>: Fire!</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: That blast came from the Death Star! That
thing’s operational! Home One, this is Gold Leader.</p>
<p><strong>ackbar</strong>: We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: You won’t get another chance at this,
Admiral.</p>
<p><strong>ackbar</strong>: We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our
cruisers can’t repel firepower of that magnitude.</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: Han will have that shield down. We’ve got to
give him more time.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: We’re coming!</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Come on! Come on!</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Oh, Artoo, hurry!</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be
so brave?</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: I’ll cover you.</p>
<p><strong>ackbar</strong>: At that close range, we won’t last long
against those Star Destroyers.</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: We’ll last longer then we will against that
Death Star…and we might just take a few of them with us.</p>
<p><strong>rebel pilot</strong>: She’s gonna blow!</p>
<p><strong>y-wing pilot</strong>: I’m hit!</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: Your fleet has lost. And your friends on
the Endor moon will not survive. There is no escape, my young
apprentice. The Alliance will die…as will your friends.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: Good. I can feel your anger. I am
defenseless. Take your weapon! Strike me down with all your hatred, and
your journey towards the dark side will be complete.</p>
<p><strong>walker pilot #1</strong>: Look!</p>
<p><strong>pilot #2</strong>: Get him off of there!</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: I think I got it. I got it!</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Let’s see.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: It’s not bad.</p>
<p><strong>stormtrooper</strong>: Freeze!</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Oh, dear.</p>
<p><strong>stormtrooper</strong>: Don’t move!</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>stormtrooper</strong>: Hands up! Stand up!</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Chewie! Get down here! She’s wounded! No,
wait…. I got an idea.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: Obi-Wan has taught you well.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I will not fight you, father.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: You are unwise to lower your defenses.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the
good in you…the conflict.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: There is no conflict.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: You couldn’t bring yourself to kill me before,
and I don’t believe you’ll destroy me now.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: You underestimate the power of the dark side.
If you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny.</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: Watch out. Squad at .06.</p>
<p><strong>rebel pilot</strong>: I’m on it, Gold Leader.</p>
<p><strong>wedge</strong>: Good shot, Red Two.</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: Now…come on, Han, old buddy. Don’t let me
down.</p>
<p><strong>han/pilot</strong>: It’s over, Commander. The Rebels have
been routed. They’re fleeing into the woods. We need reinforcements to
continue the pursuit.</p>
<p><strong>control room commander</strong>: Send three squads to help.
Open the back door.</p>
<p><strong>second commander</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Throw me another charge.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: You cannot hide forever, Luke.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I will not fight you.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: Give yourself to the dark side. It is the
only way you can save your friends. Yes, your thoughts betray you. Your
feelings for them are strong. Especially for…</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: Sister! So…you have a twin sister. Your
feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from
me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side,
then perhaps she will.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Never-r-r!</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: Good! Your hate has made you powerful. Now,
fulfill your destiny and take your father’s place at my side!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Never! I’ll never turn to the dark side.
You’ve failed, Your Highness. I am a Jedi, like my father before me.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: So be it…Jedi.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Move! Move!</p>
<p><strong>ackbar</strong>: The shield is down! Commence attack on
theDeath Star’s main reactor.</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: We’re on our way. Red Group, Gold Group, all
fighters follow me. Told you they’d do it!</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: If you will not be turned, you will be
destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: Young fool…only now, at the end, do you
understand.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: Your feeble skills are no match for the
power of the dark side. You have paid the price for your lack of
vision.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: Now, young Skywalker…you will die.</p>
<p><strong>wedge</strong>: I’m going in.</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: Here goes nothing.</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: Now lock onto the strongest power source. It
should be the power generator.</p>
<p><strong>wedge</strong>: Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of
space real fast.</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: Split up and head back to the surface. See if
you can get a few of those TIE fighters to follow you.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Copy, Gold Leader.</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: That was too close.</p>
<p><strong>ackbar</strong>: We’ve got to give those fighters more time.
Concentrate all fire on that Super Star Destroyer.</p>
<p><strong>controller</strong>: Sir, we’ve lost our bridge deflector
shield.</p>
<p><strong>piett</strong>: Intensify the forward batteries. I don’t want
anything to get through.</p>
<p><strong>piett</strong>: Intensify forward firepower!</p>
<p><strong>commander</strong>: It’s too late!</p>
<p><strong>lure</strong>: But you’ll die.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: Nothing can stop that now. Just for once… let
me look on you with my own eyes.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: No. You’re coming with me. I can’t leave you
here. I’ve got to save you.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: You already have, Luke. You were right about
me. Tell your sister…you were right.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Father…I won’t leave you.</p>
<p><strong>wedge</strong>: There it is!</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator
on the north tower.</p>
<p><strong>wedge</strong>: Copy, Gold Leader. I’m already on my way
out.</p>
<p><strong>ackbar</strong>: Move the fleet away from the Death Star.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: They did it!</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: I’m sure Luke wasn’t on that thing when it
blew.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: He wasn’t. I can feel it.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: You love him, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: All right. I understand. Fine. When he comes
back, I won’t get in the way.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Oh. No, it’s not like that at all. He’s my
brother.</p>
