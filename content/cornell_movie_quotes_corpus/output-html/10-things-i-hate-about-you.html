<h1 id="things-i-hate-about-you">10-things-i-hate-about-you</h1>
<p><strong>rider</strong>: Hey – sorry.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Leave it</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Did you change your hair?</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: You might wanna think about it</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Hey, Bianca.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Awesome shoes.</p>
<p><strong>miss perky</strong>: I’m sure you won’t find Padua any
different than your old school. Same little asswipe mother-fuckers
everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>miss perky</strong>: Any questions?</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: I don’t think so, ma’am</p>
<p><strong>miss perky</strong>: Then go forth. Scoot I’ve got deviants
to see.</p>
<p><strong>miss perky</strong>: Patrick Verona. I see we’re making our
visits a weekly ritual.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: I missed you.</p>
<p><strong>miss perky</strong>: It says here you exposed yourself to a
group of freshmen girls.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: It was a bratwurst. I was eating lunch.</p>
<p><strong>miss perky</strong>: With the teeth of your zipper?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: You the new guy?</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: So they tell me…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: C’mon. I’m supposed to give you the
tour.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: So – which Dakota you from?</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: North, actually. How’d you ?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I was kidding. People actually live
there?</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: Yeah. A couple. We’re outnumbered by the
cows, though.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: How many people were in your old
school?</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: Thirty-two.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Get out!</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: How many people go here?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Couple thousand. Most of them evil</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: We’ve got your basic beautiful people.
Unless they talk to you first, don’t bother.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Those ’re your cowboys.</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: That I’m used to.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Yeah, but these guys have never seen a
horse. They just jack off to Clint Eastwood.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: To the right, we have the Coffee Kids. Very
edgy. Don’t make any sudden movements around them.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: And these delusionals are the White
Rastae.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Big Marley fans. Think they’re black.
Semi-political, but mostly, they watch a lot of Wild Kingdom, if you
know what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Derek - save some for after lunch, bub?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Michael, my brother, peace</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: So where do you fit in all this?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Future MBAs- We’re all Ivy League, already
accepted. Someday I’ll be sipping Merlot while those guys –</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: are fixing my Saab. Yuppie greed is back,
my friend.</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: That girl – I –</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: You burn, you pine, you perish?</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: Who is she?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Bianca Stratford. Sophomore. Don’t even
think about it</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I could start with your haircut, but it
doesn’t matter. She’s not allowed to date until her older sister does.
And that’s an impossibility.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. blaise</strong>: Well, then. Oh, yes. I guess that does
it for our analysis of The Old Man and the Sea. Any other comments?
Kat?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Why didn’t we just read the Hardy Boys?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. blaise</strong>: I’m sorry?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: This book is about a guy and his fishing habit.
Not exactly a crucial topic.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Frankly, I’m baffled as to why we still revere
Hemingway. He was an abusive, alcoholic misogynist who had a lot of
cats.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: As opposed to a bitter self-righteous hag who
has no friends?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. blaise</strong>: That’s enough, Mr. Dorsey.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I guess the school board thinks because
Hemingway’s male and an asshole, he’s worthy of our time</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: What about Colette? Charlotte Bronte? Simone de
Beauvoir?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Mother Goose?</p>
<p><strong>miss perky</strong>: Katarina Stratford. My, my. You’ve been
terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist
action.</p>
<p><strong>miss perky</strong>: Well, yes, compared to your other
choices of expression this year, today’s events are quite mild. By the
way, Bobby Rictor’s gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case
you’re interested.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I still maintain that he kicked himself in the
balls. I was merely a spectator.</p>
<p><strong>miss perky</strong>: The point is Kat – people perceive you
as somewhat …</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Tempestuous?</p>
<p><strong>miss perky</strong>: No … I believe “heinous bitch” is the
term used most often.</p>
<p><strong>miss perky</strong>: You might want to work on that</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: As always, thank you for your excellent
guidance.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: I realize the language of Mr. Shakespeare
makes him a bit daunting, but I’m sure you’re all doing your best.</p>
<p><strong>insert - “joey dorsey said hi to me in the hall! oh!
my</strong>: GOD!”</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Ms. Stratford, do you care to comment on
what you’ve read so far?</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Not really.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Mandella – since you’re assisting us, you
might as well comment. I’m assuming you read the assignment.</p>
<p><strong>mandella</strong>: Uh, yeah, I read it all</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: The whole play^</p>
<p><strong>mandelia</strong>: The whole folio. All the plays.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: You’ve read every play by William
Shakespeare?</p>
<p><strong>mandella</strong>: Haven’t you?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: The fact that you’re cutting gym so you can
T.A. Sophomore English just to hear his name, is a little without in
itself if you ask me.</p>
<p><strong>mandella</strong>: Who’s that?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Patrick Verona Random skid.</p>
<p><strong>mandella</strong>: That’s Pat Verona? The one who was gone
for a year? I heard he was doing porn movies.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I’m sure he’s completely incapable of doing
anything that interesting.</p>
<p><strong>mandella</strong>: He always look so</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Block E?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Mandella, eat. Starving yourself is a very slow
way to die.</p>
<p><strong>mandella</strong>: Just a little.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>mandella</strong>: An attempted slit.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I realize that the men of this fine institution
are severely lacking, but killing yourself so you can be with William
Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions. You’re
venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of
those who need very expensive therapy.</p>
<p><strong>mandella</strong>: But imagine the things he’d say during
sex.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Okay, say you do it. You kill yourself, you end
up in wherever you end up and he’s there. Do you really think he’s gonna
wanna dace a ninety pound compulsive who failed volleyball?</p>
<p><strong>cohort</strong>: Virgin alert.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Lookin’ good, ladies.</p>
<p><strong>mandella</strong>: Tragic.</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: Why do girls like that always like guys
like that?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Because they’re bred to. Their mothers
liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene
pool is rarely diluted.</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: He always have that shit-eating grin?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Joey Dorsey? Perma-shit-grin. I wish I
could say he’s a moron, but he’s number twelve in the class. And a
model. Mostly regional stuff, but he’s rumored to have a big tube sock
ad coming out.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: You know French?</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: Sure do … my Mom’s from Canada</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Guess who just signed up for a tutor?</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: You mean I’d get a chance to talk to
her?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: You could consecrate with her, my
friend.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven’t you
been reading your Sassy?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you
featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow. Tough break.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: They’re running the rest of me next month.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: The people at this school are so incredibly
foul.</p>
<p><strong>mandella</strong>: You could always go with me. I’m sure
William has some friends.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Need a ride, ladies?</p>
<p><strong>mandella</strong>: That’s a charming new development</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Remove head from sphincter! Then pedal!</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: You all right?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Yeah, just a minor encounter with the
shrew.</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: That’s her? Bianca’s sister?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: “Undulating with desire, Adrienne removes her
crimson cape, revealing her creamy –”</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: In the microwave.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Make anyone cry today?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Sadly, no. But it’s only four-thirty.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Where’ve you been?</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Nowhere… Hi, Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Hello, precious.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: How touching.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: What’s this? It says Sarah Lawrence?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I guess I got in</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: What’s a synonym for throbbing?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the
country.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I thought we decided you were going to
school here. At U of 0.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: You decided.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Is there even a question that we want her to
stay?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Ask Bianca who drove her home</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Swollen…turgid.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Who drove you home?</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Now don’t get upset. Daddy, but there’s this
boy… and I think he might ask…</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: No! You’re not dating until your sister
starts dating. End of discussion.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: What if she never starts dating?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Then neither will you. And I’ll get to sleep
at night.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: But it’s not fair – she’s a mutant,
Daddy!</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: This from someone whose diary is devoted to
favorite grooming tips?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Enough!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Do you know what this is?</p>
<p><strong>bianca and walter</strong>: The sound of a fifteen-year-old
in labor.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: This is why you’re not dating until your
sister does.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: But she doesn’t want to date.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Exactly my point</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Jesus! Can a man even grab a sandwich before
you women start dilating?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Tumescent!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You’re not helping.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Can we make this quick? Roxanne Korrine and
Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on
the quad. Again.</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: Well, I thought we’d start with
pronunciation, if that’s okay with you.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Not the hacking and gagging and spitting
part. Please.</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: Okay… then how ’bout we try out some French
cuisine. Saturday? Night?</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: You’re asking me out. That’s so cute. What’s
your name again?</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: No, no, it’s my fault – we didn’t have a
proper introduction —</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: Cameron.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: The thing is, Cameron – I’m at the mercy of
a particularly hideous breed of loser. My sister. I can’t date until she
does.</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: Seems like she could get a date easy
enough…</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Unsolved mystery. She used to be really
popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick
of it or something.</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: That’s a shame.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Gosh, if only we could find Kat a
boyfriend…</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: Let me see what I can do.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: You’re in school for one day and you ask
out the most beautiful girl? Do you have no concept of the high school
social code?</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle
her with charm and she falls in love with me.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Unlikely, but even so, she still can’t go
out with you. So what’s the point?</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: What about him?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: You wanna go out with him?</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: No - he could wrangle with the sister.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: What makes you think he’ll do it?</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: He seems like he thrives on danger</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: No kidding. He’s a criminal. I heard he lit
a state trooper on fire. He just got out of Alcatraz…</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: They always let felons sit in on Honors
Biology?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I’m serious, man, he’s whacked. He sold his
own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: Forget his reputation. Do you think we’ve
got a plan or not?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Did she actually say she’d go out with
you?</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: That’s what I just said</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: You know, if you do go out with Bianca,
you’d be set. You’d outrank everyone. Strictly A-list. With me by your
side.</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: I thought you hated those people.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Hey – I’ve gotta have a few clients when I
get to Wall Street.</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: So now all we gotta do is talk to him.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I’ll let you handle that.</p>
<p><strong>pepe</strong>: Some people like the Colombian, but it all
depends on your acidity preference. Me? I prefer East African and
Indonesian. You start the day with a Sumatra Boengie or maybe and
Ethiopian Sidamo in your cup, you’re that much farther ahead than
someone drinkin’ Cosia Rican or Kona – you know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: Hey, there</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: Later, then.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Are you lost?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Nope - just came by to chat</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: We don’t chat.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Well, actually, I thought I’d run an idea
by you. You know, just to see if you’re interested.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: We’re not.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Hear me out. You want Bianca don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: But she can’t go out with you because her
sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her.
right?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Does this conversation have a purpose?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: So what you need to do is recruit a guy
who’ll go out with her. Someone who’s up for the job.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Exactly</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Oh, hey, nothin’ man Purely good will on my
part.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I have a dick on my face, don’t I?</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: You got him involved?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Like we had a choice? Besides – when you
let the enemy think he’s orchestrating the battle, you’re in a position
of power. We let him pretend he’s calling the shots, and while he’s busy
setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca.</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: You’re one brilliant guy</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah
Lawrence and insists that I go to his male-dominated, puking frat boy,
number one golf team school. I have no say at all.</p>
<p><strong>mandella</strong>: William would never have gone to a state
school.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: William didn’t even go to high school</p>
<p><strong>mandella</strong>: That’s never been proven</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Neither has his heterosexuality.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy
death, but I’m consuming. Do you mind?</p>
<p><strong>mandella</strong>: Does it matter?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: If I was Bianca, it would be, “Any school you
want, precious. Don’t forget your tiara.”</p>
<p><strong>mandella</strong>: Janice Parker told me he was a roadie for
Marilyn Manson.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Janice Parker is an idiot</p>
<p><strong>miss perky</strong>: I don’t understand, Patrick. You haven’t
done anything asinine this week. Are you not feeling well?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Touch of the flu.</p>
<p><strong>miss perky</strong>: I’m at a loss, then. What should we talk
about? Your year of absence?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: How ’bout your sex life?</p>
<p><strong>miss perky</strong>: Why don’t we discuss your driving need
to be a hemorrhoid?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: What’s to discuss?</p>
<p><strong>miss perky</strong>: You weren’t abused, you aren’t stupid,
and as far as I can tell, you’re only slightly psychotic – so why is it
that you’re such a fuck-up?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Well, you know – there’s the prestige of
the job title… and the benefits package is pretty good…</p>
<p><strong>miss perky</strong>: Fine. Go do something repugnant and give
us something to talk about next week.</p>
<p><strong>mandella</strong>: Look, it’s really easy.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: You’re a freedom fighter. Be proud,
sister.</p>
<p><strong>mandella</strong>: It’s Mandella with two L’s. I am not
related to Nelson Mandela. I am not a political figure. I do not live in
South Africa. My parents just spent a few too many acid trips thinking
they were revolutionaries.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: But you freed our people</p>
<p><strong>mandella</strong>: Your “people” are white, suburban high
school boys who smoke too much hemp. I have not freed you, Trevor. Only
you can free yourself.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: C’esc ma tete. This is my head</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: Right. See? You’re ready for the quiz.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: I don’t want to know how to say that though.
I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are. How much
does champagne cost? Stuff like Chat. I have never in my life had to
point out my head to someone.</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: That’s because it’s such a nice one.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Forget French.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan
progressing?</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: Well, there’s someone I think might be
–</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Show me</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Give me a sign when he walks by. And don’t
point.</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: There.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: I guess he didn’t see me Some other time
–</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: My God, he’s repulsive. He’s so perfect!</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Yeah</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Two legs, nice rack…</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Yeah, whatever. I want you to go out with
her.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Sure, Sparky. I’ll get right on it.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: You just said</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: You need money to take a girl out</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: But you’d go out with her if you had the
cake?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Yeah, I’d take her to Europe if I had the
plane.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: You got it, Verona. I pick up the tab, you do
the honors.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: You’re gonna pay me to take out some
girl?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: I can’t date her sister until that one gets a
boyfriend. And that’s the catch. She doesn’t want a boyfriend.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: I can’t take a girl like that out on twenty
bucks.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Fine, thirty.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Take it or leave it. This isn’t a
negotiation.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Fifty, and you’ve got your man.</p>
<p><strong>mr. chapin</strong>: Good run, Stratford.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Hey. Girlie.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: I mean Wo-man. How ya doin’?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Sweating like a pig, actually. And
yourself?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: There’s a way to get a guy’s attention.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: My mission in life.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Obviously, I’ve struck your fancy. So, you see,
it worked. The world makes sense again.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Pick you up Friday, then</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Oh, right. Friday.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: The night I take you to places you’ve never
been before. And back.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Like where? The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you
even know my name, screwboy?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: I know a lot more than that</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Doubtful. Very doubtful.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: You’re no bargain either, sweetheart.</p>
<p><strong>scurvy</strong>: So I guess the Jeep won’t be getting a new
Blaupunkt.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: He took the bait.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Have you ever considered a new look? I mean,
seriously, you could have some potential buried under all this
hostility.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I have the potential to smack the crap out of
you if you don’t get out of my way.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Can you at least start wearing a bra?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Hey</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: You hate me don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I don’t really think you warrant that strong an
emotion.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Then say you’ll spend Dollar Night at the
track with me.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: And why would I do that?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Come on – the ponies, the flat beer, you
with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass…</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: You – covered in my vomit.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Seven-thirty?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Nice ride. Vintage fenders.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Are you following me?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: I was in the laundromat. I saw your car.
Thought I’d say hi.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Hi</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: You’re not a big talker, are you?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Depends on the topic. My fenders don’t really
whip me into a verbal frenzy.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Hey – do you mind?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Not at all</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: You fucking bitch!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: My insurance does not cover PMS</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Then tell them I had a seizure.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing
me?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I thought you were punishing me.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Why can’t we agree on this?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Because you’re making decisions for me.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: As a parent, that’s my right</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: So what I want doesn’t matter?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You’re eighteen. You don’t know what you
want. You won’t know until you’re forty-five and you don’t have it.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I want to go to an East Coast school! I want
you to trust me to make my own choices. I want –</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Christ! I want a night to go by that I’m not
staring a contraction in the face.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: When I shell out fifty, I expect results.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: I’m on it</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Watching the bitch trash my car doesn’t count
as a date.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: I got her under control. She just acts
crazed in public to keep up the image.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Let me put it to you this way, if you don’t
get any action, I don’t get any action. So get your ass on hers by the
end of the week.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: I just upped my price</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: A hundred bucks a date.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Forget her sister, then.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: You better hope you’re as smooth as you think
you are, Verona.</p>
<p><strong>int. tutoring room - day</strong>: Cameron runs a sentence
past Bianca.</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: La copine et I ’ami? La diferance?</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: A “copine” is someone you can count on. An
“ami” is someone who makes promises he can’t keep.</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: You got something on your mind?</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: I counted on you to help my cause. You and
that thug are obviously failing. Aren’t we ever going on our date?</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: You have my word. As a gentleman</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: You’re sweet.</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: How do you get your hair to look like
that?</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Eber’s Deep Conditioner every two days. And
I never, ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment.</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: You know, I read an article about that.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: You did?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Say it</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Whatever the hell it is you’re standin’
there waitin’ to say.</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: We wanted to talk to you about the
plan.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: What plan?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: The situation is, my man Cameron here has a
major jones for Bianca Stratford.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: What is it with this chick? She have three
tits?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I think I speak correctly when I say that
Cameron’s love is pure. Purer than say – Joey Dorsey’s.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I’m just
in this for the cash.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: That’s where we can help you. With Kat.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: So Dorsey can get the girl?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Patrick, Pat, you’re not looking at the big
picture. Joey’s just a pawn. We set this whole thing up so Cameron can
get the girl.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: You two are gonna help me tame the wild
beast?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: We’re your guys.</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: And he means that strictly in a non-
prison-movie type of way.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Yeah – we’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: We’re in.</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: This is it. A golden opportunity. Patrick
can ask Katarina to the party.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: In that case, we’ll need to make it a
school-wide blow out.</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: Will Bogey get bent?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Are you kidding? He’ll piss himself with
joy. He’s the ultimate kiss ass.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Which do you like better?</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: I think I like the white shirt</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: It’s more</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Expensive?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Exactly So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau’s
thing on Saturday?</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Hopefully.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Good, ’cause I’m not gonna bother if you won’t
be there.</p>
<p><strong>int. tutoring room</strong>: Bianca sits across from Cameron,
who’s transfixed, as always</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Have you heard about Bogey Lowenstein’s
party?</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: Sure have.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: I really, really, really wanna go, but I
can’t. Not unless my sister goes.</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: I’m workin’ on it. But she doesn’t seem to
be goin’ for him.</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: She’s not a…</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Lesbian? No. I found a picture of Jared Leto
in one of her drawers, so I’m pretty sure she’s not harboring same-sex
tendencies.</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: So that’s the kind of guy she likes? Pretty
ones?</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Who knows? All I’ve ever heard her say is
that she’d dip before dating a guy that smokes.</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: All right. What else is she partial to?</p>
<p><strong>int. dive bar - night</strong>: Patrick plays pool with some
random deviant cronies.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Lou, it’s okay. They’re with me.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: What’ve you got for me?</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: I’ve retrieved certain pieces of
information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you’ll find helpful.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Good enough.</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: Number one. She hates smokers</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: It’s a lung cancer issue</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: Her favorite uncle</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Dead at forty-one.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Are you telling me I’m a -
“non-smoker”?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Just for now.</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: Another thing. Bianca said that Kat likes –
pretty guys.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: What? You don’t think I’m pretty?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: He’s pretty!</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: Okay! I wasn’t sure</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: Okay – Likes: Thai food, feminist prose,
and “angry, stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion”.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: So what does that give me? I’m supposed to
buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who
can’t play their instruments?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Ever been to Club Skunk?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow
night.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Don’t make me do it, man</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Assail your ears for one night.</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: It’s her favorite band.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I also retrieved a list of her most recent
CD purchases, courtesy of American Express.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Michael – did you get this information
“illegally”?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I prefer to think of it simply as an
alternative to what the law allows.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: I’m likin’ you guys better</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: This is really music?</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Can you turn down the Screaming Menstrual
Bitches? I’m trying to study.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Don’t tell me you’re actually going out? On
a school night, no less.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Oh my God, does this mean you’re becoming
normal?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club
Skunk and we’re going.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Oh, I thought you might have a date I don’t
know why I’m bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein’s
party Saturday night?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: I think you’re a freak. I think you do this
to torture me. And I think you suck.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Let’s hit it.</p>
<p><strong>mandella</strong>: You think this’ll work?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: No fear.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Hello! We’d like two for Gigglepuss!</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I can count.</p>
<p><strong>mandella</strong>: I’ll bet you can..</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Go ahead. And you</p>
<p><strong>mandella</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Take it easy on the guys in there.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Next time, leave the Bic at home, Skippy.</p>
<p><strong>skippy</strong>: It’s a bottle opener.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Verona, my man.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Always a pleasure, Brucie.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Didn’t have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.
Aren’t they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Fan of a fan. You see a couple of minors
come in?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Never</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Padua girls. One tall, decent body. The
other one kinda short and undersexed?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Just sent ’em through.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Hey – what happened to that chick you brought
last time? The one with the snake?</p>
<p><strong>lead singer</strong>: Hello, out there. We’re Gigglepuss and
we’re from Olympia.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Pet my kitty!</p>
<p><strong>lead singer</strong>: Meow</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I need agua!</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Shit</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: What can I get you?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Two waters.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: You’re not fooling anyone.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: hey. Great show, huh?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: That’s what you want, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Do you mind? You’re sort of ruining it for
me.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: You’re not surrounded by your usual cloud of
smoke.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: I know. I quit.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Oh, really?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: You know, these guys are no Bikini Kill or
The Raincoats, but they’re right up there.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: You know who The Raincoats are?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Why, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: I watched you out there I’ve never seen you
look like that</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Come to that party with me.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: You forgot to pay!</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: I got it, Rick.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Nine-thirty then.</p>
<p><strong>mandella</strong>: What’d he say?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Who cares?</p>
<p><strong>mandella</strong>: Has he importun’d you with love in
honourable fashion?</p>
<p><strong>mandella</strong>: Don’t be Cruella with me. I’m in favor of
romance. You’re the one that wants to march on Washington every five
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Gigglepuss was so beyond.</p>
<p><strong>mandella</strong>: They were. I only wish William could have
been here to witness the rebirth of punk rock with us.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: So true.</p>
<p><strong>int. hallway - day</strong>: Cameron and Michael are at
Michael’s locker.</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: So, then she says that she almost didn’t
wear the Kenneth Coles with that dress because she thought she was
mixing, you know, genres. And the fact that I noticed – and I’m quoting
here - “really meant something.”</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: You told me that part already.</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: Hell, I’ve just been going over the whole
thing in my head and -</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Hey. Dingo Boingo</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: I hear you’re helpin’ Verona.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Uh, yeah. We’re old friend*</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: You and Verona?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: What? We took bathes together when we were
kids.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: What’s your gig in all this?</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: I’m just the new guy.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: You better not fuck this up. I’m heavily
invested.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Hey – it’s all for the higher good
right?</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: Is it about me?</p>
<p><strong>miss perky</strong>: You’re completely demented.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: See you next week!</p>
<p><strong>miss perky</strong>: You two know each other?</p>
<p><strong>patrick/kat</strong>: Yeah/No.</p>
<p><strong>miss perky</strong>: Dear God, stay away from her. If you two
ever decided to breed, evil would truly walk the earth.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: She’s obviously not going.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Daddy, I –</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: And where’re you going?</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: If you must know, we were attempting to go
to a small study group of friends.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Otherwise known as an orgy?</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: It’s just a party. Daddy, but I knew you’d
forbid me to go since “Gloria Steinem” over there isn’t going –</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Do you know about any party? Katarina?</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Daddy, people expect me to be there!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: If Kat’s not going, you’re not going.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: You’re ruining my life’ Because you won’t be
normal, I can’t be normal.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: What’s normal?</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Bogey Lowenstein’s party is normal, but
you’re too busy listening to Bitches Who Need Prozac to know that.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: What’s a Bogey Lowenstein?</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Can’t you forget for just one night that
you’re completely wretched?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: At least I’m not a clouted fen- sucked
hedge-pig.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Like I’m supposed to know what that even
means.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: It’s Shakespeare. Maybe you’ve heard of
him?</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Yeah, he’s your freak friend Mandella’s
boyfriend. I guess since I’m not allowed to go out, I should obsess over
a dead guy, too.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Girls</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I know about the goddamn party. I’m going.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Oh, God. It’s starting.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: It’s just a party. Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Wear the belly before you go.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Daddy, no!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Just for a minute</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I want you to realize the weight of your
decisions.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: You are so completely unbalanced.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Can we go now?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Promise me you won’t talk to any boys unless
your sister is present.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Because she’ll scare them away.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Nine-thirty right?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: I’m early.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I’m driving.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Who knocked up your sister?</p>
<p><strong>bogey</strong>: Nice to see you. Martini bar to the right,
shots in the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Lookin’ fresh tonight, Pussy-Kat</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Wait – was that?– Did your hairline just
recede?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Where ya goin?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Away.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Your sister here?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Leave my sister alone.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: And why would I do that?</p>
<p><strong>jock</strong>: A fight!</p>
<p><strong>coffee kid #1</strong>: That was a New Guinea Peaberry, you
Folger’s-crystals-slurping-buttwipe.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Just who I was looking for.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: BIANCA</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Drink up, sister.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: “I’m getting trashed, man.” Isn’t that what
you’re supposed to do at a party?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: I say, do what you wanna do.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Funny, you’re the only one</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Moose, my man! Ranked fifth in the state.
Recruiters have already started calling.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Yo, Clem. A Patsy Cline fan, but hates the
new Leanne Rimes. Ziggy, peace, bra. Prefers a water pipe, but has been
known to use a bong.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Follow the love, man</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Where did he go? He was just here.</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Joey.</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: Evening, ladies.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: Looks like things worked out tonight,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: You know Chastity?</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: I believe we share an art instructor</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: Great</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Would you mind getting me a drink,
Cameron?</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: Certainly Pabst? Old Milwaukee?
RaiJieer?</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Surprise me.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Extremely unfortunate maneuver.</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: The hell is that? What kind of ’guy just
picks up a girl and carries her away while you’re talking to her?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Buttholus extremus. But hey, you’re making
progress.</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: No, I ’ m not.</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: She used me! She wants to go out with
Dorsey. Not me. I’m an idiot!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: At least you’re self-aware</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: So yeah, I’ve got the Sears catalog thing
going – and the tube sock gig ” that’s gonna be huge. And then I’m up
for an ad for Queen Harry next week.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Queen Harry?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: It’s a gay cruise line, but I’ll be, like,
wearing a uniform and stuff.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Neat…</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: My agent says I’ve got a good shot at being
the Prada guy next year.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: He practically proposed when he found out we
had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, but
he’s not exactly relevant party conversation.</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: Is he oily or dry?</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Combination. I don’t know – I thought he’d
be different. More of a gentleman…</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: Bianca, I don’t think the highlights of
dating Joey Dorsey are going to include door-opening and
coat-holding.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Sometimes I wonder if the guys we’re
supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out
with, you know?</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: All I know is – I’d give up my private
line to go out with a guy like Joey.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Bianca, I need to talk to you – I need to tell
you –</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: I really don’t think I need any social
advice from you right now.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I want another one</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: My man</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: It’s about time.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: A deal’s a deal.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: How’d you do it?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Do what?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Get her to act like a human</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Okay?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I’m fine. I’m</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: You’re not okay.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I just need to lie down for awhile</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Uh, uh. You lie down and you’ll go to
sleep</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I know, just let me sleep</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: What if you have a concussion? My dog went
to sleep with a concussion and woke up a vegetable. Not that I could
tell the difference…</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Okay, I’ll just sleep but stay awake, okay?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: C’mon, let’s walk</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Cameron, I’m a little busy</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: It’s off. The whole thing.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: What ’re you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: She’s partial to Joey, not me</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Cameron – do you like the girl?</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: Sure</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Then, go get her</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: This is so patronizing.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Leave it to you to use big words when
you’re shitfaced.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Why ’re you doing this?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: I told you</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: You don’t care if I die</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Sure, I do</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Because then I’d have to start taking out
girls who like me.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Like you could find one</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: See that? Who needs affection when I’ve got
blind hatred?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Just let me sit down.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: How’s that?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Jesus. You’re like a weeble</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Why’d you let him get to you?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Dorsey.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I hate him.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: I know. It’d have to be a pretty big deal
to get you to mainline tequila. You don’t seem like the type.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Hey man. . . You don ’ t think I can be “cool”?
You don’t think I can be “laid back” like everyone else?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: I thought you were above all that</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: You know what they say</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: No. What do they say?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Jingle Bells! Jingle Belles! Wake up damn
it!</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Kat! Wake up!</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: I thought you were…</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Go away</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Dinner taste better on the way out?</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: I don’t get you. You act like you’re too
good for any of this, and then you go totally apeshit when you get
here.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: You’re welcome.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Cute</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: A bunch of us are going to Jaret’s house.
Wanna come?</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: I have to be home in twenty minutes.</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: I don’t have to be home ’til two.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Then, c’mon. Maybe next time –</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: Have fun tonight?</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Tons</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Cameron?</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Do you think you could give me a ride
home?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: I’m driving, so I get to pick the
tunes.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: It’s my car.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: And I’m in control of it.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: But it’s Gigglepuss - I know you like them. I
saw you there.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: When you were gone last year – where were
you?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Busy</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Were you in jail?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: No, you weren’t</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Then why’d you ask?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Why’d you lie?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I should do this.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Do what?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: This.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Start a band?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: My father wouldn’t approve of that that</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: You don’t strike me as the type that would
ask permission.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Oh, so now you think you know me?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: I’m gettin’ there</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: The only thing people know about me is that I’m
“scary”.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: So what ’ s up with your dad? He a pain in
the ass?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: He just wants me to be someone I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: BIANCA</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: No offense, but you’re sister is without. I
know everyone likes her and all, but …</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: You know – you’re not as vile as I thought you
were.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: So, I’ll see you in school</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: I looked for you back at the party, but you
always seemed to be “occupied”.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: I was?</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: You never wanted to go out with ’me, did
you?</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Well, no…</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: Then that’s all you had to say.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: But</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: You always been this selfish?</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: Just because you’re beautiful, doesn’t mean
you can treat people like they don’t matter.</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: And I’m back in the saddle.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Kat, my lady, you sway to the rhythm of my
heart.</p>
<p><strong>clem</strong>: Yippe kai-aye, bra. Dance for me, cowgirl.</p>
<p><strong>clem</strong>: Okay, now tell me again why he didn’t shoot
the deputy?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Because the deputy meant him no harm, my
friend. It was only the sheriff that was the oppressor.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Kat, babe, you were on fire.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. blaise</strong>: Well now, did everyone have a good
weekend?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Maybe we should ask Verona</p>
<p><strong>mrs. blaise</strong>: Okay then. Well. Oh, yes</p>
<p><strong>mrs. blaise</strong>: I’d like you all to write your own
version of Shakespeare’s Sonnet #141.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. blaise</strong>: Any form you’d like. Rhyme, no rhyme,
whatever. I’d like to see you elaborate on his theme, however. Let’s
read it aloud, shall we? Anyone?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. blaise</strong>: Derek?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes/
For they in thee a thousand errors note/ But ’tis my heart that loves
what they despise/ Who in despite of view is pleas ’d to dote.</p>
<p><strong>clem</strong>: Ms. Blaise, can I get the bathroom pass? Damn
if Shakespeare don’t act as a laxative on my person.</p>
<p><strong>int. kenny’s thai food diner - day</strong>: Kat and Mandella
scrape the peanuts out of their sauce.</p>
<p><strong>mandella</strong>: You went to the party? I thought we were
officially opposed to suburban social activity.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I didn’t have a choice.</p>
<p><strong>mandella</strong>: You didn’t have a choice? Where’s Kat and
what have you done with her?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.</p>
<p><strong>mandella</strong>: You didn’t</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I got drunk. I puked. I got rejected. It was
big fun.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Hey</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: So you got cozy with she who stings?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: No - I’ve got a sweet-payin’ job that I’m
about to lose.</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: What’d you do to her?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: I don ’ t know. I decided not to nail her
when she was too drunk to remember it.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I’m on it</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Hey there. Tired of breathing?</p>
<p><strong>mandella</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Cool pictures. You a fan?</p>
<p><strong>mandella</strong>: Yeah. I guess.</p>
<p><strong>mandella</strong>: You think?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Oh yeah.</p>
<p><strong>mandella</strong>: Who could refrain that had a heart to love
and in that heart, courage to make ’ B love known?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Macbeth, right?</p>
<p><strong>mandella</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Kat a fan, too?</p>
<p><strong>mandella</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: So, listen… I have this friend</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: She hates you with the fire of a thousand
suns . That’s a direct quote</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: She just needs time to cool off I’ll give
it a day.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Maybe two.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: You makin’ any headway?</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: She kissed me.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Don’t talk to me about the sweetest date. That
little halo Bianca is gonna be prone and proven on prom night. Six
virgins in a row.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: I don’t know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the
flowers. Another hundred for the tux –</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Enough with the Barbie n’ Ken shit. I
know.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Take it</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Can you even imagine? Who the hell would go to
this a bastion of commercial excess?</p>
<p><strong>mandella</strong>: Well, I guess we’re not, since we don’t
have dates .</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Listen to you! You sound like Betty, all pissed
off because Archie is taking Veronica.</p>
<p><strong>mandella</strong>: Okay, okay, we won’t go. It’s not like I
have a dress anyway</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: You ’ re looking at this from the wrong
perspective. We’re making a statement.</p>
<p><strong>mandella</strong>: Oh, good. Something new and different for
us.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Hey, sweet cheeks.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Hi, Joey.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: You’re concentrating awfully hard considering
it’s gym class.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Listen, I want to talk to you about the
prom.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: You know the deal. I can ’ t go if Kat
doesn’t go –</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Your sister is going.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Since when?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: I’m taking care of it.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine
Mystique? I lost my copy.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: I heard there was a poetry reading.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: You ’re so –</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Pleasant?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Wholesome.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Unwelcome.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Unwelcome? I guess someone still has her
panties in a twist.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Don’t for one minute think that you had any
effect whatsoever on my panties.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: So what did I have an effect on ?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: You were right. She’s still pissed.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Sweet love, renew thy force!</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Man – don’t say shit like that to me.
People can hear you.</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice
yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Best case scenario, you’re back on the
payroll for awhile.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: What’s the worst?</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: You get the girl.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: If I go down. I’m takin’ her with me</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: “This morning, I woke up with this feeling,
I didn’t know how to deal with, and so I just decided to myself–”</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: “I’d hide it to myself. And never talk
about it. And didn’t I go and shout it when you walked into the room
–”</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: ” I think I love you I ”</p>
<p><strong>miscreant</strong>: Nice song, Verona.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Flog me.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Excuse me, Mr. Chapin?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Sir, I’d like to state for the record that
Mr. Verona ’ s current incarceration is unnecessary. I never filed a
complaint.</p>
<p><strong>mr. chapin</strong>: You didn’t have to. He disrupted a
classroom.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: But, Mr. Chapin, I hardly think a simple
serenade warrants a week of detention. There are far more hideous acts
than off-key singing being performed by the student body on a regular
basis.</p>
<p><strong>mr. chapin</strong>: You’re not gonna change my mind, Kat.
Rules stick.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Wait, Mr. Chapin. There’s something I’ve always
wanted to show you.</p>
<p><strong>mr. chapin</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: These.</p>
<p><strong>mr. chapin</strong>: I’m going to let that slide, Katarina.
But if I catch you doing that again, you’ll be in here with the rest of
these guys.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Thank you, Mr. Chapin.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: He left! I sprung the dickhead and he cruised
on me.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Look up, sunshine</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: I guess I never told you I’m afraid of
heights.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: C’mon. It’s not that bad</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Try lookin’ at it from this angle</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Put your right foot there –</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Forget it. I’m stayin’.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: You want me to climb up and show you how to get
down?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: You shit!</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: The Partridge Family?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: I figured it had to be something ridiculous
to win your respect. And piss you off.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Good call.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: So how’d you get Chapin to look the other
way?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I dazzled him with my wit</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: A soft side? Who knew?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Yeah, well, don’t let it get out</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: So what’s your excuse?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Acting the way we do.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Yes</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I don’t like to do what people expect. Then
they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you
change.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: So if you disappoint them from the start,
you’re covered?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Something like that</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Then you screwed up</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: You never disappointed me.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: You up for it?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: For. . . ?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Damn it!</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Look, Mom</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: State trooper?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Fallacy.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: The duck?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Hearsay.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I know the porn career’s a lie.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Do you?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Tell me something true.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: I hate peas.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: No – something real. Something no one else
knows.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: You’re sweet. And sexy. And completely hot
for me.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: No one else knows</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: You’re amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever
told you that?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Go to the prom with me</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Is that a request or a command?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: You know what I mean</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: No what?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: No, I won’t go with you</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Because I don’t want to. It’s a stupid
tradition.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: People won’t expect you to go…</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Why are you doing this?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: All of it – what’s in it for you?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Create a little drama? Start a new rumor?
What?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: So I have to have a motive to be with
you?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: You tell me.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: You need therapy. Has anyone ever told you
that?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Answer the question, Patrick</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Nothing! There’s nothing in it for me. Just
the pleasure of your company.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: cover that up</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Quick question – are you going to the
prom?</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Then Guillermo says, “If you go any lighter,
you’re gonna look like an extra on 90210.”</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: do you listen to this crap?</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: What crap?</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Me. This endless …blonde babble. I’m like,
boring myself.</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: Thank God! If I had to hear one more story
about your coiffure…</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: I figured you’d get to the good stuff
eventually.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: What good stuff?</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: The “real you”.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Like my fear of wearing pastels?</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: I’m kidding. You know how sometimes you just
become this “persona”? And you don’t know how to quit?</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: No</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Okay – you’re gonna need to learn how to
lie.</p>
<p><strong>insert - “0 fair one. join me at the prom. i will
be</strong>: WAITING. LOVE, WILLIAM S.”</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: You’re gonna look splendiferous in that,
Mandella.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: that’s cool to say.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or
a British rear admiral?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Pirate – no question.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you.
It’s tomorrow night –</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: The prom? Kat has a date?</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: No, but</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: It’s that hot rod Joey, right? That ’ s who
you want me to bend my rules for?</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: He’s not a “hot rod”. Whatever that is.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You’re not going unless your sister goes.
End of story.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Fine. I see that I’m a prisoner in my own
house. I’m not a daughter. I’m a possession!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You know what happens at proms?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: They’ll dance, they’ll kiss, they’ll come
home. Let her go.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Kissing? Is that what you think happens?
Kissing isn’t what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Listen, I know you hate having to sit home
because I’m not Susie High School.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Like you care.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I do care. But I’m a firm believer in doing
something for your own reasons, not someone else ’ s .</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: I wish I had that luxury. I’m the only
sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can’t go, because you won ’
t.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Joey never told you we went out, did he?</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: In 9th. For a month</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: He was, like, a total babe</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: But you hate Joey</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Now I do. Back then, was a different story.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: As in…</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: He said everyone was doing it. So I did it.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: You did what?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Just once. Afterwards, I told him I didn’t want
to anymore. I wasn’t ready. He got pissed. Then he broke up with me.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: But</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: After that, I swore I’d never do anything just
because “everyone else” was doing it. And I haven’t since. Except for
Bogey’s party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display –</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Why didn’t you tell me?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I wanted to let you make up your own mind about
him.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: No. you didn’t! If you really thought I
could make my own decisions, you would’ve let me go out with him instead
of helping Daddy hold me hostage.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: That’s not</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: I’m not stupid enough to repeat your
mistakes.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I guess I thought I was protecting you.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: God, you’re just like him! Just keep me
locked away in the dark, so I can’t experience anything for myself</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can’t
always trust the people you want to.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: I guess I’ll never know, will I?</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Feel like shopping?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: What do you wanna watch? We’ve got crap,
crap, crap or crap</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Dr. Ruth?</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Hi, Mommy. WALTER</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Honey, you look beautiful!</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: You like? My date should be here in
five.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I’m missing something.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: I have a date, Daddy. And he ’ s not a
captain of oppression like some men we know.</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: Wow</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Have a great time, honey!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: But – who – what –?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Hey, guys. I’m going to the prom. See you in a
few.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: What just happened?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Your daughters went to the prom.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Did I have anything to say about it?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Absolutely not.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: That ’ s what I thought</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: I’m here to pick up Bianca.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: late</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: How’d you get a tux at the last minute?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: It’s Scurvy’s. His date got convicted.
Where’d you get the dress?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: It’s just something I had. You know</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Oh huh</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Look, I’m – sorry – that I questioned your
motives. I was wrong.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: No prob.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: are you ready?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: C’mon. Let’s get this over with.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Quite the ostentatious display</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Look, Clem even wore his good boots</p>
<p><strong>mandella</strong>: Have you seen him?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>mandella</strong>: William - he asked me to meet him
here.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Oh, honey – tell me we haven’t’ progressed to
full-on hallucinations.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Mi’ lady.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: You think you ’ re the only sophomore at
the prom?</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: I did.</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: And just so you know, my date isn’t
planning on spending most of the night in his backseat.</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: Joey Dorsey is only after one thing - -
your cherry. He practically made a public announcement.</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: I wanted to tell you</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: My grandmother’s .</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: That’s where I was last year. She’d never
lived alone – my grandfather died – I stayed with her. I wasn’t in jail,
I don’t know Marilyn Manson, and I’ve never slept with a Spice Girl. I
spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the couch watching Wheel of
Fortune. End of story.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: That ’ s completely adorable!</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: It gets worse – you still have your
freshman yearbook?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: What’s Bianca doing here with that cheese
dick? I didn’t pay you to let some little punk ass snake me.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Feces hitting fan. C’mon</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Joey, pal, compadre. Let’s take it
easy.</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: Admit it. You lost. Be a man.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Very uncool, my brother</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: I’m not your brother, white boy.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Just so you know – she’ll only spread her legs
once.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: That’s for making my date bleed</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: That’s for my sister.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: And that’s for me.</p>
<p><strong>cowboy</strong>: And that’s for the fourth grade,
asshole.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Wait I…</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: You were paid to take me out! By – the one
person I truly hate. I knew it was a set-up!</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: It wasn’t like that.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Really? What was it like? A down payment now,
then a bonus for sleeping with me?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: I didn’t care about the money.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: I cared about –</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: You are so not what I thought you were.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Are you sure you don’t want to come with us?
It’ll be fun.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I ’ m sure .</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: You looked beautiful last night, you
know.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: So did you</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: She okay?</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: I hope so.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Was that your sister?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Yeah. She left with some bikers Big ones. Full
of sperm.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Funny.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I don’t understand the allure of dehydrated
food. Is this something I should be hip to?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: No, Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Parts of it.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Which parts?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some
guy.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Bianca did what?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: What’s the matter? Upset that I rubbed off on
her?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: No – impressed.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You know, fathers don’t like to admit that
their daughters are capable of running their own lives. It means we’ve
become spectators. Bianca still lets me play a few innings. You’ve had
me on the bleachers for years. When you go to Sarah Lawrence, I won’t
even be able to watch the game.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: When I go?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Oh, Christ. Don’t tell me you’ve changed
your mind. I already sent ’em a check.</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: Katarina?</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: I’d like to express my apologies.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: I didn’t mean for you to get – When Bianca
asked me to find you a boyfriend, I had no idea it would turn out so –
ugly. I would never have done anything to compromise your - - -</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Who can tell me at what point Lucentio
admits his deception?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Family emergency.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Let go!</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: You set me up.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: I just wanted –</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: What? To completely damage me? To send me to
therapy forever? What?</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: No! I just wanted</p>
<p><strong>miss perky</strong>: Ladies? Shall we take a trip to my
office?</p>
<p><strong>miss perky</strong>: So you’re the real bitch</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Yes! Okay? Yes – I’m the real bitch. I
wanted her to get a boyfriend so I could. Apparently, this makes me a
horrible person. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: I swear – I didn’t know about the money. I
didn’t even know Joey was involved. I would never intentionally hurt
you, Kat.</p>
<p><strong>miss perky</strong>: Do you care to respond?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Am I supposed to feel better? Like, right now?
Or do I have some time to think about it?</p>
<p><strong>miss perky</strong>: Just smack her now.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: We’ll be getting back to you.</p>
<p><strong>miss perky</strong>: What, no hug?</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it
just me?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: It’s just you.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. blaise</strong>: All right. I’m assuming everyone found
time to compose, their poems. Except for Mr. Dorsey, who’s still in
ICU.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. blaise</strong>: Would anyone care to read theirs
aloud?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I’11 go</p>
<p><strong>mrs. blaise</strong>: Oh, Lord.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. blaise</strong>: Please proceed.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I hate the way you talk to me/ and the way you
cut your hair/ I hate the way you drive my car/ I hate it when you
stare.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I hate your big dumb combat boots/ and the way
you read my mind/ I hate you so much it makes me sick/ it even makes me
rhyme.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I hate the way you’re always right/ I hate it
when you lie/ I hate it when you make me laugh/ even worse when you make
me cry/ I hate it that you’re not around/ and the fact that you didn’t
call/ But mostly I hate the way I don ’ t hate you/ not even close, not
even a little bit, not even any at all.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: A Fender Strat. You bought this?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: I thought you could use it. When you start
your band.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Besides, I had some extra cash. Some
asshole paid me to take out a really great girl.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Is that right?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for
her.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: You know – it’s not every day you find a
girl who’ll flash her tits to get you out of detention.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: You can’t just buy me a guitar every time you
screw up, you know.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: I know</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: And don’t just think you can</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object
on this grill?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Because I like to torture you.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Oh, Bianca? Can you get me my freshman
yearbook?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Don ’ t you even dare. . .</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: They do to!</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: They do not!</p>
<p><strong>cameron</strong>: Can someone please tell her that sunflower
seeds come from sunflowers?</p>
<p><strong>mandella</strong>: I can’t remember a word of Shakespeare
right now. Isn’t that weird?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: You’re freaked over this, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: He’s more than freaked. He’s froke</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I’d like to call your attention to Patrick
Verona’s stunning bad-ass look of 1995 —</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Patrick – is that- a.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Perm?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Ask my attorney.</p>
