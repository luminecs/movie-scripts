<h1 id="the-jacket">the-jacket</h1>
<p><strong>william starks</strong>: I was 25 years old the first time I
died…</p>
<p><strong>william starks</strong>: I remember there was so much white
everywhere. And I felt peace…even though there was war around me. And I
felt alive, even though I knew I was dead.</p>
<p><strong>intern #1</strong>: Come on, come on, let’s tag these guys
and get them out of here.</p>
<p><strong>intern #1</strong>: Wait, so how old?</p>
<p><strong>intern #1</strong>: Here he is. William Starks. Born in
Vermont. He hasn’t got a family listed. The naval hospital’ll figure out
what to do with him.</p>
<p><strong>intern #1</strong>: He’s been tagged already. Worry about the
others… Oh shit! Shit! CODE BLUE! We need a doctor! Get a doctor over
here now!</p>
<p><strong>captain medley</strong>: The level of arms on the ground
really depends. But no, I’d have to say we haven’t had to engage on the
ground as heavily as we might have expected.</p>
<p><strong>newsanchor</strong>: Have you lost any men today,
Captain?</p>
<p><strong>captain medley</strong>: No. One of my Corporals took a
bullet to the head, but it looks like he might make it. Looks that
way…</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Sergeant Starks was very lucky. A little
more to the right and it wouldn’t have wanted to come out…</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: But he’s never gonna be able to remember what
happened?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: It’s hard to say. Sergeant Starks could have
retrograde amnesia or… any form of psychological suppression. It’s very
common with traumas like this.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: Sergeant, you have no surviving family
in the States. I’m sure you have friends or distant relatives, but
unfortunately we have no record of them yet.</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: Captain Medley has recommended you for the
Purple Heart, Sergeant.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Can I have one of those?</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: There is help for you, Sergeant.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: Of course there is.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: I didn’t know where my home was. I just knew
I didn’t want to be there anymore.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Come on, mom. Don’t fall asleep…</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: You two ok?</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Our car won’t start.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Jean? Jean, can you hear me? I need you to
try to wake up, Jean.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Your mom take anything before this
happened?</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Yeah, but I don’t know what.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Jackie.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Nice to meet you, Jackie. Why don’t you wrap
this scarf around yourself and try to keep your mom awake while I take a
look at your car.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: What do you think of all this snow?</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: But I like it I guess.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Hey, can you reach the gas pedal?</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Go ahead, turn it on. Keep pushing it.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Get your fucking hands off my daughter!</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Mom, he just fixed our car.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Jackie, get in the car. NOW!</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Look, I don’t want any trouble, so…</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Neither do I, ma’am. I’ll be on my way.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Mom, you’ve got it wrong…</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: You’re just gonna walk?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Yeah, I’ll hitch a ride or something. Let
her throw it all up before she gets back behind the wheel.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: What’re those?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Dog tags. They’ve got your name and date of
birth for identification.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: In case you get lost, or can’t remember who
you are.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: I think I can remember what’s on them.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: William Starks. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: “Jackie” and “Jean” are the only …things you
know for certain about that day?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Are you aware we have no last name, no place
of residence, and no record of any physical presence for these “friends”
of yours? How’s that possible in this day and age?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I may need to actually hear that answer,
Mr. Starks.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hale</strong>: William Starks could be blocking the
incident. It would explain his well- systematized scheme about the
little girl and her mother. A delusion as complex as that can often
replace the reality of an incident like this.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hale</strong>: I have heard of Gulf War Syndrome. The
medical community is only beginning to gather information about it.</p>
<p><strong>prosecution</strong>: Gulf War Syndrome? What the…Why don’t
we start diagnosing Hard Life Syndrome while we’re at it? I’ve gotten a
lot of convictions we could overturn with that logic…</p>
<p><strong>captain medley</strong>: Sergeant Starks was awarded the
Purple Heart. That award doesn’t applaud violence or murder. It applauds
honor.</p>
<p><strong>defense</strong>: For God’s sake, my client said he thinks
he’s already died once. He doesn’t know what’s going on.</p>
<p><strong>jury foreman</strong>: On the count of first degree murder,
we find the defendant, William Starks, not guilty by reason of
insanity.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: I hereby sentence you to be committed to a
facility for the criminally insane, where I hope that doctors and the
proper treatment can help you…</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Mr. Starks, I hope that someday you might be
well so that we will have lost only one life in this tragedy.</p>
<p><strong>chief of staff</strong>: I’d certainly say he should be
considered violent, just given his case…</p>
<p><strong>dr. becker</strong>: How’d he dodge a conviction?</p>
<p><strong>chief of staff</strong>: His defense argued post-traumatic
stress and delusional disorder. He evidently couldn’t account for a
similar incident during his service in Desert Storm.</p>
<p><strong>dr. becker</strong>: So why isn’t he just in the psych ward
of the county jail?</p>
<p><strong>chief of staff</strong>: Apparently, he’s a decorated vet.
And had another one testify for him. Who knows? Tom, do you mind taking
him?</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: William? William, can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: I’ve given you some drugs to help with your
adjustment…</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: Well, your condition’s pretty serious.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: So they say. What?</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: I’m just looking at you. Does that make you
uncomfortable?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Depends on what you’re seeing.</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: You said you couldn’t remember killing
Officer Harrison. Correct?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: You don’t believe me, do you?</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: It’s not my job to believe you.</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: It’s ok, Harold. It’s ok.</p>
<p><strong>nurse harding</strong>: Come on, army boy. Time for some
therapy.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Wait. Wait a minute… Please.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: I, I don’t belong here.</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: No. I don’t think you do either. But neither
of us can do anything about that.</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: Take him out of it.</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: William. William, can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>nurse harding</strong>: That’s not enough, is it?</p>
<p><strong>mackenzie</strong>: That’s Kingsley. Old bastard hears us,
I’m sure. He just doesn’t want to bother answering so he makes us think
he can’t talk. I know. I tried it on my mother for two months once
before she fished out my tongue. Literally. You’re the cop killer,
right?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Yeah, guess so. How’d you know?</p>
<p><strong>mackenzie</strong>: TV. Helps numb any active mind. Rudy
MacKenzie.</p>
<p><strong>mackenzie</strong>: That’s too bad. I don’t believe in
disposable language either – you know, the small talk, the little talk.
Chit. Chat. Useless. The game’s something else though. Think about it:
What can we trade with each other in the air between us? This… is our
court. I’m ready to throw the ball. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>mackenzie</strong>: I tried to kill my wife.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Don’t you go to jail for that?</p>
<p><strong>mackenzie</strong>: I tried something like 30 times.</p>
<p><strong>mackenzie</strong>: She’s bigger than me, and she’s stronger
than me. And I never planned on doing it. It was always in the heat of
the moment. I didn’t beat her or anything. Hell, she beat me. But when
we’d start fighting, I’d go for the knife. Then she kept threatening to
have me put away, and she finally did.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Yeah, well 30 times probably would make you
seem crazy.</p>
<p><strong>mackenzie</strong>: Or just plain stupid. You’d think by the
twentieth time, I’d have found an alternative method. Maybe a more
effective one, if you know what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>dr. lorenson</strong>: Morning, gentlemen. How are you doing
today?</p>
<p><strong>mackenzie</strong>: It’s a hard one for me, Dr. Lorenson. The
world around me, it’s shrinking. There’s not even room for light to make
its way in. Da-da-bum! Da- da-bum! I feel like the horseman of doom is
coming for me, Doc. Only today, he’s not carrying flowers.</p>
<p><strong>mackenzie</strong>: What? It’s better than fine.</p>
<p><strong>dr. lorenson</strong>: And you, Mr. Starks?</p>
<p><strong>dr. lorenson</strong>: Mr. MacKenzie, do you think I could
talk to Mr. Starks privately?</p>
<p><strong>mackenzie</strong>: Of course you can, Doc. William, it was
an absolute pleasure. Thanks for playing.</p>
<p><strong>mackenzie</strong>: Hey…when they talk you out to the woods
tonight and invite the wolves, dance with them. They don’t eat you when
there’s music playing.</p>
<p><strong>dr. lorenson</strong>: So you’re ok?</p>
<p><strong>dr. lorenson</strong>: I asked you if you’re ok.</p>
<p><strong>dr. lorenson</strong>: I don’t know. You’re not my
patient.</p>
<p><strong>dr. lorenson</strong>: You look like you’ve lost some weight.
Are you eating?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: I am. One of the few things I remember doing
is eating. So I guess I must be exercising it off in my dreams.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: You done with your small talk?</p>
<p><strong>dr. lorenson</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>damon</strong>: I’m sorry, Starks. Must have not seen you
coming there.</p>
<p><strong>nurse harding</strong>: You gonna get the fuck up?</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: I’m glad to see you’re cooperating this
time, Mr. Starks.</p>
<p><strong>dr. gries</strong>: Hold him while I get the
tranquilizer.</p>
<p><strong>damon</strong>: Fuck the tranquilizer! I got a foot.</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: No. That’s not necessary.</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: Let him go. I said, let him go!</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: The only thing your mind is missing is a
conscience.</p>
<p><strong>dr. gries</strong>: Wait…Dr. Becker, how long do you want us
to leave him in for?</p>
<p><strong>dr. gries</strong>: Just strap him in for now.</p>
<p><strong>dr. gries</strong>: You ok?</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>dr. gries</strong>: Listen, I hate to bother you…</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: Then don’t.</p>
<p><strong>dr. gries</strong>: But… what about Starks?</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: What about Starks?</p>
<p><strong>dr. gries</strong>: Should we be…</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: Should we be what? Trying to change him any
way we can? Yes.</p>
<p><strong>dr. gries</strong>: But the Jacket? I mean…should we be
leaving him in like that? Leaving him in? The medication I’m given him
is intended to adjust – maybe even reset – his violent proclivities. You
know, peel away some of those layers of hate. The Jacket’s merely a safe
place for that to happen. The grounds and the halls – where I can’t
monitor side effects I can’t predict – aren’t.</p>
<p><strong>dr. gries</strong>: I’m not looking for anything.</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: It’s Christmas Eve, Justin. Don’t you have
somewhere to be?</p>
<p><strong>nurse harding</strong>: Ah, man, look, It’s A Wonderful
Life.</p>
<p><strong>damon</strong>: You got any booze?</p>
<p><strong>nurse harding</strong>: ’Course I do. And it is the season
for giving so let’s get to it.</p>
<p><strong>mackenzie</strong>: When they take you out to the woods
tonight and invite the wolves, dance with them.</p>
<p><strong>mackenzie</strong>: They don’t eat you when there’s music
playing.</p>
<p><strong>ext. creek</strong>: A shot of clear water, not too deep…</p>
<p><strong>ext. desert, iraq</strong>: A sublime sunset…</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Where do you think you’re going?</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: You gonna answer me?</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: If you’re deaf, read my lips…I don’t need
a psycho following me today.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: I’m not deaf.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: I forgot my purse.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: In case you hadn’t figured, it’s Christmas
Eve. You’re never gonna get a cab here.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: All right. You got somewhere you need to
go, Mister?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: I’m not sure.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Let me ask you that again. This time, look
around and consider your options.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: You got somewhere you need to go,
Mister?</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Great, get in.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: So, where do you want me to drop you?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: I’m not sure.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: You don’t have anywhere to stay?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Well, where are you from?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: I’m not sure. I don’t really know.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Of course you don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Why “of course”?</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Because in my life, it wouldn’t make sense
for me to pick up some normal guy with a place where he’s from and a
place where he’s going to. It’d be too simple. I probably wouldn’t know
how to handle a situation like that.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Well, you definitely didn’t pick normal or
simple this time either.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: At least you’re honest. That’s some kind
of start.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: That’s great. You’re not sure where you’re
from or where you’re going, but at least you’ve got manners.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Well, you got a coat or something?</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Well, how’d you get here?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: I was dropped off.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Do you have a motel or something?
Money?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Well, don’t you somewhere? Stuff?
Belongings?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: No. Not around here.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: All right, we’ll get to my place and call
around, see where I can take you. Just don’t think of trying
anything.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Great. That was our last option. What am I
going to do with you?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Nothing. Thanks for bringing me this
far.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Where are you going? You’ll freeze out
there. You don’t even have a coat.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: I’ll manage.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: No, you won’t. You’ll die of cold out
there and then I’ll have to feel guilty. And I’ve already got more guilt
than I know what to do with. Do you want something to drink?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: No, I’m ok.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Shit! That was one of my good glasses!</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Yeah, I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: You know what? It’s Christmas Eve. And you
look clean – I mean, you’re normal-looking. It’s Christmas Eve, and I
have a couch.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: I’m not gonna hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Ok. My name’s William by the way.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: The best I could do with what was in your
fridge.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: I only lit it because it was so cold in
here. I’m sorry if…</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: No, it’s fine. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: You want a drink?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: This is pretty good. Considering…</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: So you’re a waitress, right? I mean…from the
uniform you were wearing.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Yup. That’s me.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: You like it?</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: I do it.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Have you always been a waitress?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Why’d you stop?</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Shit happens, and your life changes. ’Bout
the best explanation of a lot of things that happen. So how come you
don’t know where you’re coming from?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: I don’t know, but I think part of it’s…</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: That I don’t really know what’s real.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Well, good for you.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Real is overrated.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: You don’t think that’s crazy?</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Maybe. Maybe not.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Sometimes I don’t know the difference
myself. And, you know something? I think I like it better that way. You
want another one?</p>
<p><strong>bob dylan</strong>: If you go when the snow flakes storm When
the rivers freeze and summer ends. Please see she has a coat so warm To
keep her from the howlin’ winds…</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: This is a great song.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: You remember it?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: But hey, who can forget those words? The man
just wants simple and good things for his woman – that she be warm and
happy. How hard can that be to remember?</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: May be easy to remember, but not easy to
get. Being warm, maybe – but, look, you don’t even have a coat and I
still have to chop wood to make a fire. And, being happy…you tell me if
that’s simple.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: They told me I joined the army when I was
seventeen. That’s when my father died and, before that, it was
apparently just me and him since I was born ’cause my mom split.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: So you never knew your mother?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: I guess not. But, as of now, I never knew
either.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Yeah. How about you?</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Never knew my father. I grew up with my
mother. Actually, I grew up around my mother. She was great though. I
mean, the way she was with her friends… She was this woman who had so
much life in her, she had to find ways to kill some of it just to be
like the rest of us. She died young.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: She fucked herself up day after day and
then, one day, she fell asleep with a burning cigarette. I came home
from work and she was gone.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Yeah, me too. Every day for the last ten
years.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: That when you stopped being a nurse?</p>
<p><strong>date</strong>: December 3, 2004.</p>
<p><strong>dr. gries</strong>: William, can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Jackie? Jackie?</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Hm…</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: What year is it?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: I’m William Starks.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Get the hell out of my house!</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: What’d you do? Snoop all over the place? You
had no right. You had no right to go through anything.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: I know it doesn’t make sense. It doesn’t
even make sense to me.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: If you don’t get out of my house right now,
I’ll call the police.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Jackie, I’m William Starks. I can prove
it.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: What? Now you’re gonna show me some kind of
driver’s license?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: No, I don’t have anything to show you. I’m
here from a mental hospital.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Well, you belong in one.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Stop it! Stop it!</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: I’m sorry for upsetting you, but I’m not
lying to you.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: You can’t be William Starks. He’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: William Starks is dead… I’ve been to his
grave.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: His body was found New Year’s Day, 19…1993.
At Alpine…</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: I looked it up.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: I gave you my dog tags.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: No, you didn’t. They found William Starks’
body dead in the snow.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: How’d he die?</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: I don’t know. But he did die.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: I know what this is…I picked you up when I
was drunk and you probably thought I’m just fucked up enough to fall for
this. But the thing is I know what I’m doing when I drink. I just
usually don’t care. Right now, I do though. And I want you out. Now.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: It’s December 25th, 1993 today.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: No, it’s not. It’s December 25th, 2004.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: I’m telling you I don’t care what time you
think you’re in. You’re not William Starks. I don’t believe in many
things, but I believe in death. And it doesn’t give back what it takes.
So whoever you are…I did a nice thing, you’ve made me regret it enough
already, so please, just leave.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: I’ll leave. But look at me. Look at my face,
Jackie. I’m not lying. I met you and your mother. I told you then that
I’d lost my memory. There was no one for miles around so I know you know
there’s no way I could have known that from a pair of dog tags you had
lying around.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Please…</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Happy Birthday.</p>
<p><strong>medley</strong>: You walk on. They pick up their guns and
fire at you, you stay. They pick up and fire at each other, and you walk
on!</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: He’s got his gun pointed at a kid.</p>
<p><strong>medley</strong>: That is not our problem.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Yeah, well, none of this is our fuckin’
problem.</p>
<p><strong>medley</strong>: We are leaving this site right now.</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: You left him in all night?</p>
<p><strong>nurse harding</strong>: Shit, he’s probably dead.</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: Don’t get all worked up, Justin. I expected
some common sense on your part and clearly I was expecting too much.
Just open the drawer.</p>
<p><strong>dr. gries</strong>: We never should have done this to
him…</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: Well, what are we gonna do about it now?</p>
<p><strong>dr. gries</strong>: Is he? Is he dead?</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: No. Get him upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: Where’s William Starks.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: I’m not sure. Dr. Becker had him moved.</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: He’s recovering on the third floor.</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: Are you kidding me? He’s not
psychotic!</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: Then how would you describe him, Beth?
Merely rebellious?</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: He’ll be a zombie in a few days, Tom. His
behavior’s hardly suggested he needed neuroleptics.</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: And you know that from what, a couple
two-minute stares across a room?</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: You sure he wasn’t provoked?</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: You sure you want to begin making that kind
of insinuation? I took five stitches during a routine therapy
session.</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: I’m sure he took some, too.</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: Yes, they are.</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: He’s not gonna end up like Casey, Tom.
Whatever happened to him is not going to “happen” to Starks. I don’t
know what you’re trying to do here …but he’s not a lab animal, Tom. You
can’t reprogram him no matter the drugs or the treatment.</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: Jesus, you really don’t let up, do you? Just
because you failed your patient doesn’t necessarily mean the rest of us
did, too. Sorry to tarnish your war hero’s image, but he is
psychotic.</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: Now, if you’ll excuse me, it’s Christmas,
and I have a family I’d like to see.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Hi, Claire.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Jackie, hi. How are you, honey?</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: I’m ok. I need a favor.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: What the hell kind of drugs are you people
giving me?</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: Just something to help you sleep.</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: I said the drugs were to help you sleep. Did
you sleep well?</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: Yes. You were. You were asleep for nearly a
whole day. It’s December 26th, William.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: It’s December 26th?</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: That’s right, William.</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: Yes. And that’s the sun and you’re on earth.
And I know you know better.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: I don’t know better. All I know is that you
left me in there.</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: In where?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: In that thing…the Jacket.</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: We were forced to use restrains if that’s
what you’re referring to.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: That wasn’t a fucking restraint.</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: Actually, that’s exactly what our equipment
is.</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: Relax.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Don’t act like I don’t know what’s real. I’m
not the one that’s crazy here.</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: Of course you’re not.</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: You’re just suffering from delusions that
are unfortunately part of your condition.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Don’t give me that. I know what’s real,
goddamnit! You strapped me in something and stuck me in a drawer.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: I didn’t dream it. I may have been asleep
but it wasn’t a dream.</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: I had a patient a few years ago. His name
was Ted Casey…</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: I don’t give a shit about your patient!</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: I wasn’t pausing to see if you did. But,
incidentally, you should, because you’re birds of a feather.</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: Ted raped and sodomized a seven-year old
girl. His lawyers asked me to have a look at him because, after his
deeds were done… he climbed into the trees of the forest where he killed
her and woofed like a dog. He couldn’t even remember his name when I
spoke to him, but, curiously enough, he could speak back. Ted never went
to prison because everyone – including me – was convinced he was sick.
So he came here.</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: Then one day a little girl came with her
mother to visit a relative and I caught Ted stealing looks at her – the
kind you really have to steal if you know what I mean. I asked Ted then
if he could remember what the little girl who he had… slain …was
wearing. He gave me a look I’ll never forget, and, when he answered, it
wasn’t with a color or any sort of physical description I’d expect. “Oh
yes,” he said. “I remember it. I remember it well.” Those were actually
his last words I think.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: We are not birds of a feather.</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: Maybe not. But I do think you’re in a tree…
woofing like a dog. And I’m just trying to help you the only way I can
think of.</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: I was careless. Happens sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: They found William Starks’ body dead in the
snow.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: How’d he die?</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: I don’t know. But he did die.</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: Hey. You’re not supposed to be out
here.</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: And if I didn’t want to come?</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: I guess I’d ask you why.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Because I don’t think I’m crazy.</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: You’re not crazy.</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: You suffer from delusional disorder. That
doesn’t mean you’re… crazy. It just means you’re confused. And you’re
here, instead of in jail, because that was determined to have played a
role in your killing of a police officer.</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: You were convicted of the crime.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: That conviction doesn’t convince me of
anything. Until I know that I did it, I’m not going to accept that I
did.</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: You may never remember at all. Your mind’s
grasp of reality and the real events that have happened to you has been
damaged.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: No. The real events that have happened to me
have been fucked up. Not my mind.</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: William, I’d like to ask you something if
I can.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Since when do people around here have to ask
permission to do anything?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Fine. Why made you ask?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Why, what would you do?</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: I could try to…make it stop.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: No. I don’t want it to.</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: So it’s helping? It’s making me feel like
a different person.</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: You should be careful. You could be killed
if they found you out here.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Believe me, I know.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: What were you talking about the other
day?</p>
<p><strong>mackenzie</strong>: I wasn’t talking about anything.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Yeah, you were. What you said about them
taking me out to the woods…</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: What do you know about the Jacket?</p>
<p><strong>mackenzie</strong>: I know you need one when it’s really
cold.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: MacKenzie, listen to me. Listen. I’m going
to die.</p>
<p><strong>mackenzie</strong>: Mortality’s actually a great thing to be
familiar with. It means you’re sane on some level.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: No, I mean in four days, I’m supposed to
die.</p>
<p><strong>mackenzie</strong>: How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: The Jacket.</p>
<p><strong>mackenzie</strong>: Oh no, you’re pretty young. Your body’ll
be able to handle a lot more of it than you think…</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: No. I mean I found out while I was in it
that my body’s gonna be found in four days.</p>
<p><strong>harding</strong>: What are you two yappin’ about?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Yeah, it is.</p>
<p><strong>harding</strong>: You know something? You’re two fucking
freaks is what you are.</p>
<p><strong>harding</strong>: I want the two of you to shut the fuck up
and eat your food.</p>
<p><strong>mackenzie</strong>: It’s gonna be sticky.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>mackenzie</strong>: ’Cause Lorenson’s got her claws in it
now. When she started getting suspicious about me was when they stopped
using it on me. Women!</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: So what am I supposed to do?</p>
<p><strong>mackenzie</strong>: You could still always give Becker an
itch. ’Course you might get killed when he goes to scratch it, but seems
to me you’re saying that’s about to happen anyway. Just be careful not
to walk yourself right into something.</p>
<p><strong>dr. gries</strong>: We’re late.</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: I wish they’d skip the formality of this
annual review and just cut our budget. Our silence on the matter should
be enough to appease the civic conscience without wasting an hour we
don’t have.</p>
<p><strong>dr. gries</strong>: Maybe it’s not such a waste.</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: It’s the ticking of a box on a sheet of
paper no one cares about.</p>
<p><strong>dr. gries</strong>: They don’t care about all the things we
do right. But they might …they might care about what we’re doing wrong.
That’s what they should come here to look for.</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: What should they be looking for?</p>
<p><strong>dr. gries</strong>: They should just be looking harder.</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: Where? It’s Becker isn’t it? He’s doing
stuff, isn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>dr. gries</strong>: Later. I’ll tell you about it later. We
got a session to catch now.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Are you ok?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Yeah, Why are you in this ward alone? Where
is everyone?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Where are the other orderlies?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: In the therapy session downstairs. That’s
what the rep’s sitting in on…</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Ok, listen. I want you to get out of here
and lock the door behind you. I’ll go get some doctors.</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: Mr. Starks, this session is for our civil
patients. Damon, please take Mr. Starks back to his ward.</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: Fine, Mr. Starks. You can pull up a chair
for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: Mr. Jensen, please continue.</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Well, I’ve been approached by the Federal
Trade Organization.</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: They want me to head the Organization for
the Organized.</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: The Organization…for the Organized?</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: That’s right. Have you heard of them?</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: No, Mr. Jensen. I have not.</p>
<p><strong>group patient 2</strong>: That’s because there is no such
Organization, you idiot.</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: That is categorically not true. Bl-bl-
blatantly and manifestly NOT TRUE. I’ve been asked to lead them. But, if
you’d heard of them, then they wouldn’t be hush-hush, would they?</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: And how is that?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: When I was in the Gulf, the Organization was
recruiting the Organized.</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: I knew it! I knew it! Those little fuckers
are everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: They recruit only the best, Mr. Jensen. I
didn’t want to have to say this…</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: But these people know about it. In fact,
when Presidents of this country and heads of state leave office, they
come here, to Alpine Grove. They’re among us right now! Isn’t that
right, Dr. Thatcher? And Jensen, I’m proud they picked you.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: They’re always ordering us to stay calm, but
how can we be calm?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: All they do is give orders. That’s all they
have to do. And no one will ever know. All it comes down to is an order.
They’ve got hands everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Long live the Organization for the
Organized!</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: Sit down, Mr. Starks! Sit down,
Mr. Starks!</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: Sit down, Mr. Jensen!</p>
<p><strong>random patients</strong>: Dr. Thatcher! Dr. Becker!</p>
<p><strong>damon</strong>: Starks, you’re like a mule. You’re real
stubborn. But there’s ways of fixin’ that. All you need is a good stick.
Here’s your stick.</p>
<p><strong>tenny</strong>: You ever been to jail?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>tenny</strong>: It’s worse than war. It’s worse than anywhere
you’ve ever been.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: I doubt it. I don’t think prison’s so bad
you don’t want to remember it…</p>
<p><strong>tenny</strong>: Well, I’ve never been to war, but I’m sure as
hell not going back to prison.</p>
<p><strong>officer harrison</strong>: Gentlemen, I’m gonna need you to
step out of the car, with your hands at your side please.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Ok, sir. I was just asking what for.</p>
<p><strong>officer harrison</strong>: This is a stolen vehicle you’re
driving. Now put your hands in the air, out where I can see ’em.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Jesus Christ, what’d you do that for?</p>
<p><strong>tenny</strong>: Man, if you’re so deaf and dumb, you ain’t
even worth a fucking bullet.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: I’ll be off in 15 minutes. Can you wait till
then?</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: The Jacket. That’s what they call it,
right?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: It was banned, you know… and it led to an
investigation of Dr. Becker’s mistreatment of some of his patients.
That’s when they found out how badly he was drugging his patients…</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: But no one knew until after…</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: After I…</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: You bled to death.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: I don’t know how you got the cut to your
head, but you died bleeding from it.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Do you really believe me?</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: I don’t know. I thought I was crazy after
you left that day. I died. I still think I could be crazy. But then I
replayed that night in my head – the parts of it I could remember – and
it was like…I don’t care if I was, or am. I haven’t felt that way in a
room with someone my whole life. And when you left, all I wanted
was…</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: I want to trust you. Should I trust you?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Then we need to figure out what happened to
you. It’s the only thing we can do.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Alpine Grove still exists. I looked it up on
the net. We should go there and see if there’s still anyone around who
might have known what happened to you.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: If they don’t take me out before then.
What’s the net?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: I didn’t kill Officer Harrison.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: How? Did they figure it out after I
died?</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: No. They never figured it out. I did. Most
murderers don’t stop to help a drunk woman and her little girl on the
side of the road. Not without hurting them.</p>
<p><strong>dr. morgan</strong>: I’m sorry I can’t tell you more about
your father’s death, Mr. Starks. Our own medical examiners determined
only that he died from a blunt trauma to the head but that was right
around the time the Alpine Grove’s staff changed and I’m afraid we
didn’t have the best record system before then.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: His body was found on January 1, 1993, but
do you know if that was long after he had died?</p>
<p><strong>dr. morgan</strong>: No, I don’t. I’m sorry. I wish I knew
more.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: What about Dr. Thomas Becker or Dr. Loel
Lorenson? There was also a Dr. Gries, I think.</p>
<p><strong>dr. morgan</strong>: Well, Dr. Lorenson is still here at the
hospital. If she was here at the time your father was, then I’m sure
she’d be of more help to you.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: What about Dr. Becker and Mr. Gries?</p>
<p><strong>dr. morgan</strong>: Unfortunately, I’m not familiar with
Dr. Becker and Dr. Gries passed away three, four years ago.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Do you have any kind of forwarding address
for Dr. Becker?</p>
<p><strong>dr. morgan</strong>: Your father was here 12 years ago. I
doubt the hospital would have that, if Dr. Becker is still even alive.
Is there a particular reason you need to know how your father died?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: He was the only family I remember.</p>
<p><strong>dr. morgan</strong>: Let me just tell her we’re here.</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: Hello. I’m Beth Lorenson.</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: It’s nice to meet you, Mr. Starks…</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: And you are…?</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: I’m just William’s friend.</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: I think we’ll be fine from here. Thanks,
Stanley.</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: My God you look exactly like him.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: I never knew my father. Did you?</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: Yeah, I did. He was my most memorable
patient.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: At the end, he made me change my mind
about a lot of things.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: You thought my father was crazy?</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: No. I don’t think he was crazy. He needed
help…but he wasn’t crazy. Your father actually helped me with a case of
mine.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: What case?</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: I was working with a boy named Eugene.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Who was Eugene?</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Just a little, when we were looking up
information about William’s father. How did he help?</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: It’s complicated, but in a way, your
father let me know how I’d get through to him.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: He just said…that I’d shock Eugene and
then things would change for him.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: I still don’t either, even after all these
years.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Do you know how my father died?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: How’d he get it?</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: But Dr. Morgan said you were around when my
father was…</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: I was. But I saw a lot of cuts and a lot
of blows. I’m sorry I don’t know more about your father’s. I didn’t know
about everything that went on here.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Well, do you think Dr. Becker would have any
idea?</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: How do you know about Dr. Becker?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: My dad wrote some things down before he
died.</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: That’s right. He did.</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: So maybe Dr. Becker would know. But, as
I’m sure you know, the statute of limitations has run out for charging
the hospital with any liabilities.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Why would we do that?</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Because Becker resigned after the charges
brought against him by State Patient Advocacy Groups.</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: I see you’ve done your homework. Alpine
Grove’s undergone a lot of changes since then. At the time, we didn’t
have the…resources to help our patients the way we needed to. Now, we
do. And things are different.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: I wouldn’t be so sure. Like you said about
back then, you might not know everything going on around here.</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: It’s important for you to know who your
father was, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Yeah, it is.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: Well… let me know how your search turns
out.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: We will.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: I don’t believe a thing she just said.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Me neither. Who was the boy she was talking
about, Eugene?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: I have no idea.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: You think Lorenson kills you?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Maybe. I don’t know. Seems more likely
Becker does, but at the very least she knows how I died.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Let’s see if they have an address for
Becker. I also want to figure out more about the kid you helped her
with.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Because that’s the part I believe is true.
You probably did help her somehow with the boy and Eugene’s name did
come up over and over again on the abstracts I pulled.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: There’s one more thing I want to see.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: This was the room. They used to hang the
Jacket there. This is where it happened. This is the room I’m actually
in right now.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: I can show you. It’s probably in there.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Maybe this wasn’t such a good idea…</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Yes, it was. My fingers were the only things
I could move. Dead bodies don’t bleed. And they certainly can’t claw so
hard they dent metal.</p>
<p><strong>damon</strong>: You folks ain’t supposed to be down here.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: We were just leaving.</p>
<p><strong>damon</strong>: Do I know you from somewhere?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: You may have known my father, William
Starks.</p>
<p><strong>damon</strong>: That’s right! Goddamn, you’re the spitting
image. I didn’t know he had a son.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: He didn’t either.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Did you know my father?</p>
<p><strong>damon</strong>: Oh yeah, sure. He killed a cop, right?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: You wouldn’t happen to know how he died,
would you?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: You don’t know any more, Damon?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: My father used to talk about you.</p>
<p><strong>damon</strong>: Oh yeah, what’d he say?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: He said you were a sadistic fuck that
belonged in jail.</p>
<p><strong>damon</strong>: Look here, I don’t like you getting in my
face and saying this bullshit to me…</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: That’s too bad.</p>
<p><strong>damon</strong>: I thought you said you never knew your
father.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: I didn’t. Did you have anything to do with
his death?</p>
<p><strong>damon</strong>: I don’t know what you’re talking about, man.
I swear. This is some weird shit you’re telling me… and I don’t know how
come you’re doing it.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: He died because he bled to death from a blow
to his head. Someone had to have given him it.</p>
<p><strong>damon</strong>: I never touched your father! I swear!</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: You know something, Damon? You’re like a
mule. You’re real stubborn. But there’s ways of fixin’ that. All you
need is a good stick. Here’s your stick. Live with it.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: How long do we have?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: They told me Becker’s in Shelbourne now. I
looked him up and he was listed.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: How far away is that?</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: What about Captain Medley? He never told
them what happened to you over there. His testimony…that coward wanted
them to think you were crazy.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: I know. It was perfect. Erase my sanity and
you erase anything I’ll ever say.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Of course it makes me mad. It makes me more
than mad. Just like remembering the face of the man who killed that
officer and knowing nothing more about him. But what’s it gonna do for
me to find them now? I can’t fix everything in three days.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: You’ve got to get yourself out of that
place. They’re going to kill you if you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: I might not be able to.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: It’s not a prison, it’s a hospital. There’s
got to be some way out of there and you’ve got to find it…</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: You’ll die if you keep smoking those in
your condition.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: I’ll die either way.</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: I can’t try to help you unless you let me.
I know about the Jacket.</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: I’m sorry for what you were put through,
and I’m sorry I couldn’t stop it earlier. But I promise you that I will
from now on…</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: You have no idea what’s going on.</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: No, I do. That’s what I’m saying to
you.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Listen to me! You don’t! The Jacket is my
only chance in this place.</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: How can you say that in your physical
condition? Do you realize that it’s because you were put in it that
you’re as…weak as you are now? Becker’s a man who’s not well
himself.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: You don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: Then help me understand. You know, you’re
not alone. A lot of Gulf Vets have begun to experience curious symptoms.
What you have might well be a syndrome and, if so, it’s not one we know
enough about to be treating it this vigorously.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: This has nothing to do with that.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: …What you do not know is the only thing you
know.</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: Where is that from?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: I don’t know. Remember?</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: Come on. Tell me what you do know.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: I’ve seen a time that’s not this time. And
I’m only able to see it when I’m in the Jacket.</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: Well, what time is it?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: You don’t believe me.</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: Ok fine. Tell me about it. Tell me about
the future. 2004. What does it look like?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: It doesn’t look all that different.</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: The future doesn’t look different?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: No. Not for people like me. Not in the
places I come from.</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: What about the world?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: I didn’t see that much of it – same as now.
I only saw it as part of my own life.</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: Do you think you’re traveling in time? Is
that it?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Not everyone in here is crazy, Doc.</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: Like who? Like MacKenzie maybe?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: MacKenzie locked himself up in his house
for two months and nearly starved himself to death before he was brought
here. All because his wife left him for another man.</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: Why don’t you help me?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Because I don’t have time.</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: I’m about to die unless I do something to
stop it.</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: And how do you know that?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Because of the future. I know what’s going
to happen.</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: William, that is just another facet of my
delusions.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: And what about your work with Eugene – the
kid? Is that another facet of my delusions?</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: How do you know about Eugene?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: You told me about him. I saw you and I think
you thought I knew something about him. So you told me.</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: There obviously is, so what don’t you just
tell me how you found out about him.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Some part of you suspects – even if you
don’t know for sure – that what I’m saying is true.</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: I don’t know how you know about Eugene,
but these ideas are part of your delusions.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: NO! They’re not my delusions! Look, just
leave my business with Becker to me!</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: One thing’s got nothing to do with the
other.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: One’s got everything to do with the other.
So unless you want my blood on your hands…leave what’s between me and
Becker between me and Becker.</p>
<p><strong>mackenzie</strong>: Hey, I brought you some smokes.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Lorenson said your wife left you for another
man and that’s when you lost it.</p>
<p><strong>mackenzie</strong>: Geez, how’s that for a fucking “thank
you”?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Is it true?</p>
<p><strong>mackenzie</strong>: She left me, I tried to kill her, I tried
to kill myself. She was mean, I was weak, I was cruel so she left, I
didn’t plan it, didn’t see it…FINE!</p>
<p><strong>mackenzie</strong>: Not this luckless little mammal’s. What
difference is it to them? You believe what you want to believe. One
version is easier than another so you make it your own.</p>
<p><strong>mackenzie</strong>: I’ll tell you this though. However nuts I
am, I wasn’t nuts enough not to know how wrong it was to put a human
being in something like that.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: MacKenzie, what if we are crazy?</p>
<p><strong>mackenzie</strong>: What if we are? There’re crazier things
than thinking up fictions for yourself. Everyone does it, don’t they?
Even Becker. That roller coaster car pops more pills than all of Ward
3.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Becker does? Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>mackenzie</strong>: I’ve been here for 11 years. It’s my
neighborhood. ’Course I’m sure. He’s as drugged up as the rest of us…I
guess he has to be to put up with all this.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Thanks for the cigarettes. You still got a
lot of problems, MacKenzie, but you’re ok.</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: At least it’s some kind of bars we’ve got
you behind.</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: Hello, William. I understand you’ve been
asking for me almost every hour. I would’ve been here sooner but you
gave our little state visitor quite a bit to talk to me about.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: That’s too bad.</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: It is. But when it comes down to it, you
just have to patient with them. They’d rather have their vacation, too,
so they just push dealing with our “practices” off to the New Year.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: They make it hard for you to get away with
your business, huh?</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: Temporarily.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Makes it a little easier for me to get away
with mine.</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: And what’s that?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: My business?</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Getting away with things. Like whatever I
may or may not have gotten away with Officer Harrison.</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: You killed him?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: And wound up in a better cage. But I still
want to make a deal.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: See, the deluxe lab animal treatment I’ve
been receiving – well, I don’t think it’s worked. I woke up today and
realized… …I don’t think I’m cured. So really, what was the point?
Torture? I think that’s still sort of illegal in some states – though
we’ll have to check on Vermont. And, how’s this for the cherry on top:
it seems my physician is a pill-popping freak. Last time I checked, that
makes some pretty good copy for a lot of these news shows. “I don’t
remember everything they did to me. I just remember the worst parts.” I
think I should be sitting down when I say it, don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: I think…I have to think about it.</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: I think your story needs a little fleshing
out before it’s ready to go.</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: I’ll say a prayer for you in Church today,
Starks. Maybe the Gods can pick up where the medicine left off.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: You sure you know where to find one?</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: I’ve managed to every Sunday of my life.
Some of us are God- fearing men, Starks.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: And what does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: Means we believe in doing his work and fear
what the world would be like if we didn’t at least try to.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Becker, how do you sleep at night?</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: You in here. Works like a drug.</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: Nina, William Starks is to stay in ICU all
night. If anything is supposed to change, I want to be called about
it.</p>
<p><strong>nina</strong>: Sure, Dr. Lorenson.</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: Hi. Sorry I’m late.</p>
<p><strong>talia</strong>: It’s ok. Hi, Eugene.</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: Talia, I need to ask you something.</p>
<p><strong>talia</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: Have you told anyone about my sessions
with Eugene?</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: Has anyone been asking about him?</p>
<p><strong>talia</strong>: No. I would have told you.</p>
<p><strong>damon</strong>: No funny business or we can make this a lot
fucking harder for you.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: No funny business.</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: Eugene, this is a “TRAIN.”</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: Come on back down here. Wherever you
are…try to come on back. You’ll like it, I promise.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: You just scared me, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Me, too.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Here, drink this. I’ll get the heat
going.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: I think this is his house.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: You’re sure?</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Yeah. I called the number yesterday to make
sure. Thomas Becker, retired</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: They’re not here.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: They’re not.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Maybe they’re out.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: How much time do we have?</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: What? What are you thinking?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: There’re no cars on this street.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Yeah, you’re right. But wait, how can that
be?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: I don’t know. Maybe that’s because this
whole thing is a dream. How can you have a street with no cars on
it?</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: I don’t know. But this isn’t a dream. I’m
real, and so is where we are.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Then why isn’t there anyone around?</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: William! William!</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Maybe he’s gone somewhere. He’ll have to
come back.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Of course he will. What day of the week is
it?</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: It’s Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Look where these people live.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: They’ve got lives to be grateful for.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: William, you’re not making sense.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: They’re at Church. And I bet that’s where
Becker is.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: You still go to Church. How’s that work?
Your God just doesn’t notice? That it? How you doin’, Dr. Becker?</p>
<p><strong>becker’s grandson</strong>: Grandpa?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: I don’t know, Dr. Becker. Can you?</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: I think you know. Your eyes say you do.</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: You’re his son?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: No. I’m not his son. I’m him. What? You look
like you’ve seen a ghost. You can come here and touch me, old man. I’m
the real thing.</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: How…how are you here?</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: You died, Starks. Years ago, in the
hospital.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: I know. You killed me, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: No. I didn’t. I swear I didn’t. I probably
helped push you to kill yourself, but I didn’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: I didn’t kill myself. I died from a blow to
the head. How’d it happen? I have to know.</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: I don’t know how you died. The last time I
put you in the Jacket was just after you told me you remembered killing
that police officer…</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: I didn’t say I remembered killing him. I
just repeated some words to get myself back in there.</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: I know. I knew that when you came out.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: Because…because you came out and said
something you couldn’t have possibly have known. You came back and
repeated three names…</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: Of people like you. People I was just trying
to help. They couldn’t get worse so I thought, with medication, they
might get…</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Medication? What kind of meds do you chase
with nights in a cadaver drawer?</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: It was part of the treatment I intended…I
didn’t know what the effects would be…</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: So, what, you guinea pig sick people to find
out?</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: The three of you weren’t regular patients.
You were criminals that ended up at Alpine Grove.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: No, we were patients.</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: You and the others didn’t seem that way
then.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Who were the others?</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: How did you come to know their names?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: You just told me. The last time I was with
you was when I was in the Jacket. I’m in it right now, Dr. Becker.</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: I don’t understand…</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: I’m in it as we speak. You’re haunting
yourself right now. I guess sometimes we indict ourselves if no one else
does. You didn’t make history like you wanted to, huh, Dr. Becker. It
turned out different, didn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>becker</strong>: I didn’t put you in Alpine Grove.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: No. You put me on drugs and then you put me
in the Jacket.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: The same way you just said I didn’t without
my ever telling you. And that still doesn’t excuse what you did. Just
because you had keys to a cage didn’t mean you had animals inside.
You’ve earned your guilt, Becker.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: That’s all you got from him? That bastard
helped take your life away from you.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: No, he didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: What? How can you say that? He’s the one
that put you in that goddamn medieval…Jacket. He’s probably the one who
killed you.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: No one’s killing anyone.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Touch me. I’m okay.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: If everything hadn’t happened the way it
has, then I wouldn’t be here right now, sitting in a car with you,
touching your face.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Why are you saying that? We don’t have long,
do we?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Where are we going?</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: To the hospital.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Claire, I need help.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: What’s happening to me? Why am I getting so
much weaker?</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Because your body can only take so much of
what they’re putting you through.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Jesus, what’s happened to him?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Lorenson’s the only one that could let me
out of there. I need something to persuade her that I was there. Get me
something to take to her.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Ok. Ssh. Rest.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: No, no. Not yet. But he doesn’t have long.
Are you sure you don’t want a doctor to look at him?</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: No! It won’t do any good. Please, Claire.
They won’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>tenny</strong>: Hey, Mister, you need a ride?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>tenny</strong>: I’m going to Canada but I can let you ride
with me up to the border.</p>
<p><strong>tenny</strong>: Can you drive?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>tenny</strong>: Great, get in. We’ll switch off in a bit.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: William, please, honey, wake up. For me.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: I found out about Eugene. The little boy.
He’s the key. That’s who you have to tell her about when you get back
there. It’s the only way to prove this to her.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Jackie?</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: When we first met, when you were 7, where
was the house you lived in with your mother? Do you remember your
address?</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: 112 Orchard Way. You’re not coming back, are
you?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: You gotta stop thinking like that.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Then, where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Nowhere. I just think I’m gonna be sick.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: I’m William Starks. I’m not his son. And…and
the kid you work with. Your friend’s son…Eugene…</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: I know. I know it all. Save your strength.
I already know everything you’re going to say. You’re in the Jacket
right now, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: How…how do you know?</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: You told me this was how it happened.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: I did?</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Who…who kills me?</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: You have nothing to fear, William.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Nathan…Piechowski. Jackson MacGregor…Ted
Casey. You didn’t cure them. You killed them.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Would you like anything, Dr. Lorenson?</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: A cup of coffee would be great, Sally.
Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Is he gonna be ok?</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: I hope so.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Me, too.</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: You’re going to be ok, William. We just
need to get your fever down and we’ll be able to hopefully stabilize
you.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Who are you kidding, Doc? You or me?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Can I get some paper and something to write
with.</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: I’m not gonna let that happen.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: You still don’t believe me, do you?</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: I do believe you…</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: No. Listen to me…the kid, Eugene…</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: No one knows you’re working with him so how
would I have found out? He’s your friend’s son, right?</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: William, I can’t indulge these delusions,
even when you’re in this state.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Listen to me. That’s all I ask.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: He’s having absence seizures when he stares
off into space like he does. He has them so often that that’s why he
hasn’t learned to speak properly.</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: Who told you this?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: You did, in the future. You figured it out
because a part of you already knows this. That’s how it works. I’m just
telling you something you already know, even if you haven’t realized
it.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: I don’t know when it’ll happen but soon I
think, you’ll shock the boy and it’ll wake him up.</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: You’ll figure it out and you’ll do good by
him.</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>talia</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: Come on Eugene, try to say it with me.
This is a “DOG”.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: D–d—d—-.</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: Are you having a seizure? Is that really
what’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: Dog. Hi.</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: You ok, Eugene?</p>
<p><strong>talia</strong>: What’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>talia</strong>: But he’s not epileptic.</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: No, but he is having seizures.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: It worked, didn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: This is really happening, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>dr. lorenson</strong>: What do you need me to do?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: I need to get this letter to someone.</p>
<p><strong>dr. lorenson</strong>: I can’t take you out of here in your
condition…</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: And I can’t stay here in my condition. I am
going to die tonight. It’s already been decided.</p>
<p><strong>dr. lorenson</strong>: No, it hasn’t.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Yes. It has. Everything up ’till today is
done. Everything starting with tomorrow is up for grabs.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: You know how to get there?</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: Sure. It’s an easy address. A little far
out there, but easy enough.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>lorenson</strong>: You want me to come with you?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: No, I’ll be ok.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: I remember you, too.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Jackie, how have you been?</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: I’ve been ok.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Good. How’s your mom?</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Ok, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Do you think I could see her?</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Hey, Jean. Nice to see you.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: I’m sorry? Your face looks awfully familiar, I
just can’t quite place it…</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Mom, this is the guy that drove us home that
afternoon we were stuck on the highway. The guy you yelled at for no
good reason…</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: There something you need?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: You could say that.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Jackie, go play in the snow.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Just do it.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: I can’t stay long. That’s my doctor and I
gotta get back to the hospital. Everything I want to say is in this
letter. You can check as much of it as you can.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: I won’t be around when you read it…but I
hope you believe it. It’d be a real shame if you didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: I should be on my way.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Bye, Jackie.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Happy New Year to both of you.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Thanks. You, too.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Hey, wait!</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: You be good to yourself, Jackie.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Ok.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: I was 25 years old the first time I died. It
didn’t end anything though. Sometimes I think we live through things
only to be able to tell them, to bear witness, to say this happened.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: And it wasn’t to someone else. It was to me.
And I lived despite it. Sometimes I think we live to beat the odds. And
sometimes I agree that life can only begin with the knowledge of death.
That it can all end, even when you least want it to.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: I’m telling you my story because it’s the
only way I can try to help your daughter, and you, have a better one of
your own.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: It’s scary…and lucky…how much we can forget.
Scary because we think the past gives us our bearing, and lucky because
in those moments I’m talking about, you realize it doesn’t. And it never
had to.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: I am not a crazy man, even though they
mistook me for one. I live in the same world as the rest of you. Only I
saw more of it.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: And the seeing is the only way you can hear
what the truth around you is saying: you can always start believing in
things you don’t already believing in. And, while you’re alive, it’s
never too late.</p>
<p><strong>distorted voice</strong>: No! Wa…atch out!</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: I promise you, Jean. No matter how bad the
days and things around you look, they look better awake than they do
asleep. I can offer you some proof: when you die, there’s only one thing
you want to have happen…sometimes so badly it comes true, I guess. You
want to come back.</p>

<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Hey there. You ok?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: I think so.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: You’re bleeding pretty bad there.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: It’s ok. It’s ok. Relax. It’s just a cut. We
can get it fixed.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: I fell down. But I’m alive.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: You work there?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Sorry, one sec.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Hey! How are you? Thanks. I was just
thinking about you, too.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Listen, I gotta go, mom, ’cause I’m late…
but, thanks. Happy New Year to you, too. I’ll call you later. Ok,
bye.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Sorry about that. It was my mom.</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: Nothin’ to worry about there.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: How you doin’?</p>
<p><strong>starks</strong>: I’m doing fine.</p>
