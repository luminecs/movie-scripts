<p><strong>serb 2</strong>: Fifteen minutes to delivery.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: All clear from above.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: What’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>serbian 2</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>serbian 1</strong>: We’ve been hit. We’re taking on
water.</p>
<p><strong>serbian 1</strong>: Grab the professor, quick!</p>
<p><strong>serbian 1</strong>: Something must be below us! Shoot!
Shoot!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Lieutenant Shane Wolfe, United States Navy.
I’m gonna get you outta here. But you have to do exactly what I say,
when I say it. My way – no highway option. Do you copy? Where’s the
briefcase?</p>
<p><strong>plummer</strong>: How did you know where I…</p>
<p><strong>seal</strong>: Give it a second, they’re almost out of
ammo.</p>
<p><strong>seal</strong>: Now Lieutenant. Chopper’s four meters at your
10 o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: I’ve got the Prof and the case. First round’s
on me back at Virginia Beach.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Hold on.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: You know how to swim?</p>
<p><strong>plummer</strong>: Oh my God. I can’t believe you… how’d we…
That was the most incredible…</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Better keep that on `til we get to the
rendezvous point.</p>
<p><strong>plummer</strong>: Why? Poison gas?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: No. I’m just not big on chit chat.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Lieutenant, thank you. You saved more than
just my life today. Can I call my wife to let her know I’m okay?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Negative. Not imperative to the mission. We
have to keep moving. I have strict orders to get you out of here
safely.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: I’m safe, Lieutenant. Please. She thinks
I’m dead. Don’t you have a family?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Make it quick.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Joe, Todd, Lulu, Peter, Tyler.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: My kids. It’s voice activated. Designed it
myself. I do security, that’s my specialty. Those guys back there tried
to get this case open for five days – couldn’t crack it. And you should
see what happens to you if open it without the code. I have a picture of
my kids in here, you want to see it?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Negative.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Battery’s dead…</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Honey, I’m alive…</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: We’re almost ready. Just gives us a -</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Professor, RUN!!!</p>
<p><strong>shane’s p.o.v.</strong>: Everything is a blur, in
slow-motion. He sees Charles, unconscious. A Huey Helicopter lands. A
VERY TALL MAN steps out, and takes Charles’ Briefcase. There is huge
explosion, as the chopper ignites. Everything is ablaze. Shane reaches
out, grabs the picture of Charles’ kids then goes unconscious.</p>
<p><strong>title card</strong>: 1 Month Later</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Captain, sir.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: As you were Lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: We’ve been through a lot together Shane.
You’re the best man I ever trained. And a good friend.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: … I know sir. And I except full
responsibility for the mission’s failure.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Why the hell did you let him use the satellite
phone?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: He had to call his family. A lapse in
judgement on my part that I regret sir.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: … Plummer was the best security expert the
department of defense ever had – a genius. He was working on a program
that scrambles launch codes. He called it</p>
<p><strong>g.h.o.s.t.</strong>: Guided High-altitude Scrambling
Transmitter. One pulse from the GHOST satellite and a country can’t
launch its own nukes. That’s what the Serbians kidnapped him for, but
they couldn’t get S</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: The case was empty sir, as I stated in my
report.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Not a surprise, really. Not like the professor
to hide things where someone might look for them. G.H.O.S.T. is still
out there, which is why I’m going to give you another shot.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Sir. Thank you. I… appreciate your
confidence.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: I’ll need to put a team together. I’m gonna
need the mini sub, I need access to an EP3 aries 2 spy plane…</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Negative. It’s not that kind of mission.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Two days ago, I got a call from the
professor’s wife… Widow. She told me someone had broken into her home.
Searched the place, top to bottom.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: She’s scared. The family’s scared. Whoever
killed the professor must think G.H.O.S.T. is in that house. Maybe it
is, maybe it isn’t. Either way, I need someone to stay at that house,
and protect them. And while you’re there – find out if the program is in
there.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: That’s it? Why would you want me for that,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: The professor’s wife requested you.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Honey, I’m alive. Listen: A lot can happen
between here and home – if anything happens to me, call Lt. Shane Wolfe.
He’s a good man… anyway, I should go. I’ll call you in an hour. I love
you.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: … You gotta problem with this mission?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Sirnosir. It’s just that… I’ve never been
very good with kids, sir. Not even when I was a kid sir.</p>
<p><strong>lulu</strong>: Mom! There’s some weird bald guy at the
door!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Lieutenant Shane Wolfe, reporting for
duty.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Of course. I’m so sorry. Thank you for
coming.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Come in and meet the rest of the gang.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Get your butts down here and say “hello!”</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: You’ve already met Lulu. This is Peter, Zoe
and Todd. Kids, this is Lieutenant Wolfe. He’s the man who is going to
be staying with us for a while.</p>
<p><strong>kids</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: And this is Helga and Tyler.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Ma’am… Baby.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Kids, go finish your homework. And I’ll be
checking.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: You have a pleasant family, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Charles wasn’t around too much. His work took
him all over the world. He’d be gone six or seven months at a time. So I
think for the younger ones it’s a little confusing. Zoe and Todd… well,
they’re dealing like your normal teenagers. Maybe in Todd’s case
semi-normal.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Mrs. Plummer, I have to tell you that I did
everything I could…</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Charles was in a dangerous business. I knew
it when I married him. No one’s to blame here. Everyone thinks that
Charles told me or the kids where he hid it. And until G.H.O.S.T. is
found, we’re all in danger.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Nothing will happen to your family as long as
I’m here. I’ve dealt with much…</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: That’s Gary. He was Charles’.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Mrs. Plummer-</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Call me Julie.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: … Mrs. Plummer, I’ll go secure the
perimeter.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I’m glad you’re here-</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: That’s wonderful. This could all be over!</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I’ll be there.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Don’t worry about the Kids, Helga will handle
everything. But if there is an emergency, all the emergency numbers are
on the fridge. And on the phone. And on the back door…</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Mom – we’ll be fine, chill.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I know, it’s just… I am a mom, it’s my job to
worry. … I love you guys. I’m gonna miss you. I’ll be back in 48 hours.
And guys, whatever Lieutenant Wolfe asks you to do… do it. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: ll the children nod in agreement except Zoe who
pops her chewing gum bubble.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Lieutenant, I don’t want you to worry about
anything except the safety of my children. Helga will take care of
everything else.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Don’t worry. They’ll be safe with me.</p>
<p><strong>helga</strong>: Everything will be fine, Mrs. Plummer.</p>
<p><strong>helga</strong>: Tell me, are you licensed to kill?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: … No.</p>
<p><strong>helga</strong>: Too bad.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Could you turn that dow-</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Hey-</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: … Where’s the baby?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: You run a very loose ship.</p>
<p><strong>helga</strong>: You don’t like it? You’re the SEAL. You do
something. I make bottle.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: … Zoe?</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: He’s my boyfriend, tool.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: So you’re the one who broke in. Zoe – go back
inside.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Okay, fine… come on Scott.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Not with this kid. You – Gimme twenty!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: I meant PUSH-UPS!</p>
<p><strong>cott</strong>: … I’ll call you, Zoe!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: My apologies. We had an intruder. A simple
misunderstanding.</p>
<p><strong>mr. chun</strong>: We speak English, Kojak.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Oh. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chun</strong>: … Look, about the 2000 decibel alarm and
the kleig lights and stuff… we own a bakery, so we’re up kind of early.
Would you mind?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>mr. chun</strong>: Thanks a bunch. Oh, and we found this in
our pool filter… Try to keep that zoo reigned in, huh baby-sitter?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Your mother thought you were in real danger.
You should have told her the truth.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Who do you think you are – my dad?</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Let me go! It’s Saturday night. I have
plans!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Not anymore.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Lights out.</p>
<p><strong>elga</strong>: When you’re down and low, lower than the
floor. And you feel like you ain’t got a chance. Don’t make a move `til
you’re in the groove, and do the Peter Panda Dance. Just hop three times
like a kangaroo –</p>
<p><strong>helga</strong>: Sidestep twice, just like the crabs do. Three
steps forward, one step back.</p>
<p><strong>helga</strong>: Then quick like a turtle lie on your back!
riggle like a snake `til you can’t no more.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: This family’s in for a rude awakening.</p>
<p><strong>l</strong>: Tyler snores in his crib. Peter in his bed.</p>
<p><strong>oe</strong>: Huh? Wha–?!</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: W-what are you doing??!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: You’re burning daylight. Move. Move.</p>
<p><strong>odd</strong>: It’s Sunday…! And it’s six a.m. You’re
insane.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Now move it!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Hey. Not in front of the kids.</p>
<p><strong>s</strong>: he gives him a look of disbelief.</p>
<p><strong>helga</strong>: What’s it matter? Nobody speaks Romanian.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Usca mi-as chilotii pe crucea lu mata!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Listen up, ladies. Your behavior is
unacceptable. In order to maintain a state of safety we need to maintain
a state of discipline and order. I’ve only got one rule: Everything is
done my way. No highway option. Do you copy?</p>
<p><strong>lulu</strong>: Do you copy?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: What? I said – do you…</p>
<p><strong>lulu</strong>: What? I said – do you…</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Do not copy me!</p>
<p><strong>ulu</strong>: Make up your mind.</p>
<p><strong>p</strong>: eter farted.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Tracking devices. Now that I know I can’t
trust you… Never take them off. The panic button is only for
emergencies. Touch that – you better be dying, or you’re dead.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: I am not wearing that. Just because my mom’s
paranoid doesn’t mean we have to take orders from you.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Let me explain how the chain of command
works. I tell you what to do – and you do it. End of chain. Now I’m not
gonna have time to learn your names. So you are – Red 1, Red 2, Red
Leader, Red baby… wait, where’s the older male? There were five.</p>
<p><strong>helga</strong>: He walks like Dracula, with footsteps silent
like death –</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: He’s in his room.</p>
<p><strong>s</strong>: hane marches to Todd’s shut door. He tries the
knob, but it’s locked. Shane bangs hard on it.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Red 4! Open this door!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: It didn’t have to go down like-</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: All I need is a hammer and some plaster of
Paris. I can fix this.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Can I get by?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Here’s your bracelet. If you’d been wearing
it, this wouldn’t have happened.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: He has to go.</p>
<p><strong>s</strong>: hane does one-handed push ups in the living room
while the Duck watches. With his other hand he loads the PHOTO of the
Chun’s license plate into his laptop computer. His head shifts, he hears
something suspicious – the rumble of a car approaching.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Whhhoooooo!</p>
<p><strong>lulu</strong>: Stop it, Peter!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Hey, hey, good soldiers aren’t afraid of
anything.</p>
<p><strong>lulu</strong>: This house is haunted. Daddy even said so. He
said there’s a ghost.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Really? And where is this ghost?</p>
<p><strong>ulu</strong>: I don’t know. I’ve never seen it.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Here he comes…!</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: He’s coming back-</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Uh-oh.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: As we discussed, this is an urgent matter.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Can’t you call somebody? Do something to get
us around all this paperwork?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Sorry. Not in Switzerland, I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: This is absurd. If we can’t get some faster
service, we’re going to have to file a complaint.</p>
<p><strong>banker</strong>: Marcel!</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: Oui.</p>
<p><strong>banker</strong>: Je ne comprende pas.</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: I’m so sorry, the chief does not speak
English. But I can tell you – you will have access to the box
tout-suite. As soon as your background checks clear.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Thank you. How long is that?</p>
<p><strong>helga</strong>: AGGH! These brats! Sugi Pula!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Red Leader, remain calm –</p>
<p><strong>helga</strong>: I am calm. I QUIT, that makes me calm!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Let’s not be hasty.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Hello— Don’t even think about it.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Ah, Mrs. Plummer. No no – everything’s fine.
You’re gonna be gone how much longer?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Five business days?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: That is not a problem. Just doing my…</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Duty.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Ah! Things are GREAT!!! You do what you have
to do.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Take care, Mrs. Plummer.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Red Leader! I command you to come back! That
is a direct order! You can’t leave a man behind!!</p>
<p>****: I don’t know the Peter Panda song!!</p>
<p><strong>korean woman</strong>: Don’t worry, if she loves you, she’ll
come back.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Okay, listen up. There’s been a change of
plans. Your mom’s not coming back as soon as she thought…</p>
<p><strong>lulu</strong>: When is she coming back?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Soon. In the meantime, we’re just gonna have
some more big fun.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: That’s what we’ve been doing?</p>
<p><strong>lulu</strong>: But tomorrow’s a school day.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: I need a signed release for Driver’s Ed!</p>
<p><strong>lulu</strong>: I’ve got Brownies!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Whoa, WHOA! HALT! We’ll take this hill one
inch at a time. Only then can we rise to the challenge. All for one, and
one for all!</p>
<p><strong>lulu</strong>: “Be all that you can be!”</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: That’s Army. I’m Navy. But I appreciate your
enthusiasm.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Tell me that was the duck?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Hey. HEY!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: The things I do for my country.</p>
<p><strong>lulu</strong>: Hi. Zoe thinks you look like the Hulk. I think
you’re cute.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>lulu</strong>: Do you know Kung Fu?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Affirmative.</p>
<p><strong>lulu</strong>: Did you ever punch someone so hard that their
head came off?</p>
<p><strong>lulu</strong>: What’s that medal for?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: None of your business.</p>
<p><strong>lulu</strong>: I’ll trade you a SpongeBob button for it.</p>
<p><strong>lulu</strong>: Is that so people can’t hurt us?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: I think – it’s time for you take a nappy-
poo, in beddibye land, little girl.</p>
<p><strong>lulu</strong>: Do I look like I’m five to you?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: What are you waiting for? Dig in.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Don’t worry, I can get lots more of those.
And I’ve survived off this stuff for months.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Like I’m really gonna eat all those carbs.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Okay, ladies. Your mama – is not here to take
care of you now. So – here’s how it’s gonna be. We’re gonna pull
together, all for one, one for all. If I say in, you stay in, if I say
out, you go out…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Ba ba do the hokie pokey…</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: I did not say at ease!</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: He’s only two, he doesn’t have any idea what
you’re talking about. I don’t have any idea what you’re talking
about…</p>
<p><strong>lulu</strong>: Can you kill a man with your bare hands?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: You play too many video games. Yes.</p>
<p><strong>lulu</strong>: … I can cross my eyes. Wanna see?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Negative.</p>
<p><strong>lulu</strong>: Tyler hates it when I do that…</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Plummer residence… yes, I know it’s Monday.
Oh. Thank you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Who was that?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Your vice principal. He said if you’re late
again, you and Todd are expelled. He wants to see you in his office.
With your … legal guardian.</p>
<p><strong>lulu</strong>: We’re gonna be late.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Not on my watch.</p>
<p><strong>close up on</strong>: a stopwatch. It hits ZERO, and at that
moment, the SCHOOL’S BELL RINGS.</p>
<p><strong>murney</strong>: I always said these kids didn’t need a baby
sitter, they needed a parole officer. Looks like Mrs. Plummer finally
listened.</p>
<p><strong>murney</strong>: What’s your name, son?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Wolfe. Shane. Lieutenant. I’m in charge of
watching these kids for… a few days.</p>
<p><strong>murney</strong>: aby-sitter huh. Well, whatever work you can
get. I’m Murphy. Duane. V.P in charge of discipline, conduct and
truancy. Top to bottom, K thru 12. You’re in my house now, boy. I coach
wrestling, too. And the creeper here played hookey from every wrestling
practice this month.</p>
<p><strong>murney</strong>: She’s missed twenty-two Driver’s Ed classes.
Out of twenty-three. They’re the worst students in my school.</p>
<p><strong>oman’s voice</strong>: Your school?</p>
<p><strong>principal claire</strong>: Good morning kids. What are you
doing in my office, Murney?</p>
<p><strong>murney</strong>: I was explaining, that as vice principal, I
am in charge of….</p>
<p><strong>principal claire</strong>: Very little. I thought I asked you
to find out who stuck to the baloney slices to the cafeteria ceiling
with mustard?</p>
<p><strong>murney</strong>: I’m got some leads. My informant’s about to
crack.</p>
<p><strong>principal claire</strong>: Then hop to it. I think I can
handle this from here.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Red 1, Red 2. Get moving.</p>
<p><strong>principal claire</strong>: So. You’re the new
baby-sitter?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Bodyguard. You see, Mrs. Plummer called my
captain, she thought the kids needed -</p>
<p><strong>principal claire</strong>: It’s okay, Lieutenant, I was
briefed of the situation by Mrs. Plummer. She told me all about you.</p>
<p><strong>principal claire</strong>: Lieutenant, huh? You with “The
Teams?” Petty Officer Third Class Claire Nelson at your service.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: … You’re kidding?</p>
<p><strong>principal claire</strong>: Four years at Naval base Coronado.
The Service paid for my college.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: “Honor, Courage…</p>
<p><strong>principal claire</strong>: Commitment”. That’s the way I live
my life, and the way I run my school.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Can’t be too careful. So. Permission to stick
around and keep eyes on the kids?</p>
<p><strong>principal claire</strong>: Permission granted. Welcome
aboard. Just try not to frighten the children.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: No one will even notice I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Clean as a whistle.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Back off. Official Business.</p>
<p><strong>binoculars p.o.v.</strong>: Five hundred students eat at long
tables. Zoe, with a group of HIP FRIENDS, turns her back to him
embarrassed. Todd, in line to get lunch, does the same. Lulu sees Shane
and waves.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Give up now. Save us both a world of pain.
Now – last time: Open the hanger, Black Hawk coming in.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Open in T minus three, two, one…</p>
<p><strong>principal claire</strong>: What would you say is the secret
with kids, Mr. Wolfe?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Show no weakness.</p>
<p><strong>rincipal claire</strong>: I’ll drink to that. Shane… Can I
call you Shane?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: … Sure.</p>
<p><strong>principal claire</strong>: So. When you agreed to serve your
country, I bet you didn’t know you’d be serving creamed bananas to one
year olds, huh?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Hey – I out rank you, you know.</p>
<p><strong>principal claire</strong>: Not here, you don’t. You’re on dry
land, lieutenant. Well, not so dry where you’re sitting, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Oh, man…</p>
<p><strong>principal claire</strong>: Don’t take this personally – but
you’re pretty good at this. Seriously, I’m impressed. A whole day, and
all three Plummer’s stayed out of trouble. That’s… unusual.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Kick his butt, Todd!</p>
<p><strong>rincipal claire</strong>: Who started this?</p>
<p><strong>murney</strong>: He did.</p>
<p><strong>principal claire</strong>: Todd started a fight with five
students at once?</p>
<p><strong>murney</strong>: The kid’s mixed up. Look at him.</p>
<p><strong>principal claire</strong>: If I catch anyone on the team
fighting again, next week’s tournament is off. I don’t care who starts
it.</p>
<p><strong>murney</strong>: You heard the lady. Any more fighting and
there’ll be no more wrestling. Personally I think that’s a little harsh.
Boys’ll be boys. `Scept for Plummer here.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: … Nice moves, man.</p>
<p><strong>murney</strong>: Pretty slick, Frogman – I’m a black belt
myself. S’why they asked me to coach the wrestling team.</p>
<p><strong>murney</strong>: See – total control. Maybe you could stop by
practice, we’d show the boys how a couple of pros do it, what do you
say? Come on, promise I’ll go easy on you.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: … Sorry, sir. I’m on duty.</p>
<p><strong>murney</strong>: Oh, yeah. That’s right. I forgot you had to
baby-sit. Maybe some other time then.</p>
<p><strong>murney</strong>: Looks like pretty boy there’s all bark and
no bite.</p>
<p><strong>principal claire</strong>: … Don’t even think it, Murney.
He’d kill you so fast, I wouldn’t even have time to get my camera.</p>
<p><strong>principal claire</strong>: Another day, another dollar
twenty, minus taxes… aren’t you gonna change him?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: I’d love to, for one who’ll eat, and not
cry.</p>
<p><strong>principal claire</strong>: That’s not what I mean, Lt.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Oh – change him. Roger that. Uh…</p>
<p><strong>principal claire</strong>: Sirnosir. Not my job.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: But…</p>
<p><strong>principal claire</strong>: Instructions are right on the box.
Bathroom’s down the hall. Have fun.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Emergency!</p>
<p><strong>lulu</strong>: See! My nanny can kick your nanny’s butt.</p>
<p><strong>close-up on the tracker screen</strong>: Two DOTS labeled RED
1 and RED 2, are heading away from the school fast.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>construction worker</strong>: What hell do you think you’re
doing?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Tell me where the kids are and I’ll let you
all live!</p>
<p><strong>construction worker</strong>: Buddy, you’re about to get a
beat down.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Red 1? Red 2?</p>
<p><strong>cute cop</strong>: 14 year old Male, weird hair. 16 year old
female. Ditto. Cancel that a.p.b..</p>
<p><strong>cute cop</strong>: In the future, use our nonemergency
number. That’s the one to call if nobody’s fleein’ or bleedin’.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Shane are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Just fine, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I should probably get going then. If you
need anymore help… Call.</p>
<p><strong>brownie</strong>: oo hoo! Hubba hubba!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Who are those people?</p>
<p><strong>lulu</strong>: It’s my troop, it’s Monday. Monday, Wednesday
and Saturday are troop nights.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Get rid of them.</p>
<p><strong>lulu</strong>: I can’t. Everybody’s parents go out on troop
nights. They won’t be home `til ten. Mom’s our den mother.</p>
<p><strong>lulu</strong>: Tonight we’re supposed to sell cookies.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Selling cookies isn’t imperative to my
mission.</p>
<p><strong>lulu</strong>: We have to. If we don’t sell enough cookies,
we can’t go the Jamboree, and if we can’t go to the Jamboree. Come on,
Shane. You gotta help me out. They already think I’m a loser. And it’s
not like I have any other friends, cause mom never lets me out of her
sight…</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Alright, ladies. Here’s how it’s gonna be.
Tonight, I’m gonna be your den – commander. That means if you want to
live to see tomorrow, do as I say. DO WE</p>
<p><strong>brownie</strong>: Den Mother? … I’m scared of you.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Good. Now – wait here.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: … yeah, he’s a total psycho. I think mom found
him from one of those Tough Love boot camps or something…</p>
<p><strong>various shots</strong>: As Shane uses the drill to seal every
window and door. He’s not just locking them – he’s</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: This is totally cruel and unusual! You can’t do
this – we could run out of air!</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: .. he’s got us on lock-down, it’s like Oz or
something. No, not munchkin Oz – HBO Oz. Hm… I dunno if that’s a good
idea, Scott…</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: I gotta get supplies. I can see you through
the window, but if anything happens…</p>
<p><strong>lulu</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>brownie</strong>: Oh no… they’re back.</p>
<p><strong>slow motion</strong>: In a shot out of Reservoir Dogs, we see
who she means: A group of bad ass, chubby CUB SCOUTS. They’re headed
straight towards the cookie table, menacingly.</p>
<p><strong>ugly cub scout</strong>: Hey Skeever, what’s stinky and
floats <code>til you flush</code>em?</p>
<p><strong>2nd scout</strong>: Brownies?</p>
<p><strong>ugly cub scout</strong>: This is Troop 16 territory. How are
we supposed to sell raffle tickets when this place reeks of your skanky
cookies?</p>
<p><strong>2nd scout</strong>: BEAT IT, before I get my face punching
badge on you.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Where are my troops?</p>
<p><strong>ugly cub scout</strong>: … I haven’t seen anybody, you
Skeever?</p>
<p><strong>2nd scout</strong>: Nope. You wanna buy a raffle ticket?
We’re trying to win .22’s.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: What happened? Well?</p>
<p><strong>lulu</strong>: Those boys over there broke our cookies.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Well then – I’m afraid I have to eliminate
them. If I don’t come back – avenge my death.</p>
<p><strong>brownies</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: This is not a toy. I’m here to protect you.
Not cookies. Get in the car, we’re going home.</p>
<p><strong>brownie</strong>: You can’t take us home yet, you’re supposed
to take us to dinner.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Welcome to Chuck E. Cheese!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: I wish I were in Chechnya.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Anything elsh I can do for you?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: In a big glass This much ice… this much
cyanide.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: How `bout a re-fill on that pischer of
Mischer Pibb?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Pischer of Mischer Pibb? Mischer Pibb?</p>
<p><strong>lulu</strong>: Let’s fight!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: I’m watching your brother…</p>
<p><strong>lulu</strong>: I pressed two player. I thought you liked
combat. Unless you’re scared.</p>
<p><strong>on the screen</strong>: they each select a fighter. Lulu
picks a small female character. Shane picks a man who looks LIKE SHANE.
They begin, Lulu screams out with her fighter, in unison:</p>
<p><strong>video game/lulu</strong>: Prepare to be annihilated!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: That’s not fair. Nobody can jump thirty
feet.</p>
<p><strong>lulu</strong>: The Hulk can.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: That wasn’t a documentary.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: This isn’t fair. My joystick’s broken.</p>
<p><strong>lulu</strong>: You wanna switch?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: You don’t have a baby on your chest…</p>
<p><strong>lulu</strong>: You’re not even trying…</p>
<p><strong>lulu</strong>: Too slow… come on – take a shot… oops too
slow… swing and a miss…</p>
<p><strong>lulu</strong>: In your face! I am the greatest hand-to- hand
combat champion in the entire world!</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Mom – stop worrying.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I’m a mom, it’s my job to worry.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Seriously, everything’s cool. The guy’s just a
control freak.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: It’s only a few more days. I hate leaving
you, but you know I have to do this. I love you.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: I know. Don’t worry, we’re okay. Tonight I’m
just doing homework – in my cell.</p>
<p><strong>teenagers</strong>: they’re keeping quiet until the phone is
in its cradle, then the TEENAGE DJ starts the music back up.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Dude, this is outta hand. Who are all these
people?</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Jus’ ma peeps. And the folks who read my</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Dude, not cool…</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Move, move, move! Go go!</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: I figured you’d come back for him – they
almost always do.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Inexcusable, to leave a man behind like
that…</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Relax, we once found a kid in the ball pool
when we opened in the morning –</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: WHOA, Whoa. Not okay, freestyling in the
ball pool – not okay.</p>
<p><strong>lulu</strong>: Should we send someone in after him?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Clear out! GO GO GO!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Party’s over.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: No one leaves until this house is spotless! I
want to be able to eat off the floor! The latrine! Hell, I wanna be able
to eat in the kitchen!!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Oh no you don’t. Now, we’re gonna do this my
way – no highway option.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Start swabbing, ladies.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: This is officially the worst party ever.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: It was YOUR idea! I don’t even know most of
these losers.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: … Thanks a lot, Rambo. My friends will never
come here again.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Those people aren’t your friends. They show
no respect for you or your house. Because you have no respect for
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: I do too respect myself.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: You got barf on your tank top. Company,
downstairs!</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: You’re not my dad!</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: We hate you, you hate us. You’re like a robot.
Why don’t you just leave us alone?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: You’re right, Red 1. I’m not the man for this
job.</p>
<p><strong>lulu</strong>: Shane –!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: In all my years I have never been treated
with such disrespect. Not even from the enemy. Don’t worry, as soon as
your mom comes back, I’m gone.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Now what?</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: It’s Scott…</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Puberty… talking doesn’t do any good. Go to
your rooms.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Go!</p>
<p><strong>ninja</strong>: GHOST – hand it over!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Okay – who wants some?</p>
<p><strong>farmer john game</strong>: The rooster goes…</p>
<p><strong>furbies</strong>: Ow! Ow!</p>
<p><strong>ninja/furbies</strong>: Ow! Ow ow! Crap!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Kids. It’s safe. You can open up.</p>
<p><strong>lulu</strong>: Please don’t leave us Shane.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: I’m not going anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: I’m sorry for giving you a hard time.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Shhh… It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Who were they? What did they want…?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: They’re looking for a program, that your
father invented.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: So Mom’s not paranoid? There really are people
out to get us.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: They’re not after you. They want this. But
nothing’s gonna happen to you, as long as I’m here. And I’m not going
anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: But I can’t do this without your help, okay?
We need a little more cooperation here. Tell you what – let’s start
over. From now on, you listen to me, and do what I say. And I… I’ll
listen to you too. Deal? Truce – okay?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: C’mon c’mon c’mon…</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Hey mom we’re fine, absolutely nothing happened
you should worry about. Nope.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Mrs. Plummer… two men tried to get into the
house tonight.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Oh my god!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: No - it’s okay. They’re gone, everyone’s
fine. They were looking for GHOST, but they didn’t find it. You have any
luck?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Well, yes and no. We found something in the
box… But we’re not sure what it is. Bill thinks it’s part of the GHOST.
It looks like some kind of “key”. We just don’t know what its for.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: The good news is I’ll be home in two days, as
soon as the customs paperwork clears.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: …So soon? We were just starting to have fun.
Don’t worry – we’ll be just fine.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: I gotta warn you guys: From now on, I’m gonna
be sticking even closer.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Will Shane Wolfe please report to Vice
Principal Murney in the gym.</p>
<p><strong>second graders</strong>: Ooooooooh!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Don’t worry. So, she wrecked a driver’s Ed.
car – she’ll pay for the damage…</p>
<p><strong>murney</strong>: That? Lady drivers, what do you expect. No,
it’s not that – it’s the boy…</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Red two? I mean Todd?</p>
<p><strong>principal claire</strong>: Ordinarily I would wait for his
mother to return… but – I’m a bit concerned, and I’m not sure what to
do…</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Has he been skipping class?</p>
<p><strong>principal claire</strong>: Well – yes. He does always miss
sixth period. But this…</p>
<p><strong>murney</strong>: This is how he showed up to practice. And
that’s not all. I was doing a little re- con in his locker… and I found
this:</p>
<p><strong>murney</strong>: If he’d had Hustler or something, boys will
be boys – but this is just sick.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: He’s not a NAZI.</p>
<p><strong>principal claire</strong>: It’s certainly not normal. See if
you can talk to the boy. Find out what’s going on.</p>
<p><strong>murney</strong>: hope you won’t go light on him – that</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: I’ll talk to him.</p>
<p><strong>murney</strong>: You’re a good man, Shane. Bet you’re a hell
of a fighter on the mats, huh? Maybe sometime we oughta strap up, we’ll
give these boys a treat.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Another time, maybe…</p>
<p><strong>murney</strong>: It’s a date then. I’ll show you a couple
moves. I promise I won’t hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>murney</strong>: See that? You never know when your adversary
is going to strike!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Did you kick me in the back? Is there a
footprint on my jacket?</p>
<p><strong>murney</strong>: Come on Frogman! Don’t be a sissy!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Wait Todd, I want to talk to you…</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Smart kid.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Zoe, you’re in charge. If anyone gets within
forty clicks of the perimeter, signal me. Keep all doors sealed, do your
homework, preheat the oven, and make sure Lulu brushes her teeth!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: You want in or out?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Alright. All my Nazis are finally here. Okay, I
want all of you at attention.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: And on stage left - VON TRAPPS! I need my Von
Trapps!</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Okeydokey. Starting from where we left off
Gimme Rolf and Liesl – let’s give You are Sixteen a run up der
flagpole…</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: You wait little girl, on an empty stage/for
fate to turn the light on/your life little girl, is an empty page/that
men will want to write on…</p>
<p><strong>actress/liesl</strong>: To write on…</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: You are sixteen, going on seventeen…</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Baby Jesus, have I done some unspeakable
evil that I deserve to be saddled with the world’s worst production of
Sound of Music? We open in a week. The set’s not finished… The cast is a
bunch of clumsy goats – every kick ball change would make Bob Fosse dig
himself out of the earth, so he could have a heart attack again.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: I’m sorry… I’ll get it right.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: None of you will ever get it right! Which
is why, I quit.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: And with that, he exits stage right… end
scene.</p>
<p><strong>liesl</strong>: You gonna fix him?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: No. My hands are freezing.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: I’m not going to quit. I hate wresting…</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: AT EASE. Would you listen, just once? Look, I
don’t know a hell of a lot about this kinda stuff, but… You’re good. A
lot to learn, but with hard work, discipline – you could make a go of
this.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: … but what about Murney?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: That guy’s an idiot.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: “Sound of Music” is a great show. My dad took
me to see it when I was a kid.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: You don’t seem like the musical type.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Come on. Julie Andrews was hot.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: What if… girls’ll think I’m… weird or
something?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: You know what girls think is weird?
Wrestling. Men in leotards pinning each other to the floor? I’ve never
understood that. Chicks dig guys who can dance.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Doesn’t matter now anyway… show’s off… it’s
over.</p>
<p><strong>liesl</strong>: We don’t have a director…</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: No director? I have directed rescue missions
in Afghanistan! I’ve directed numerous snatch and grabs in countries
who’s names you are not allowed to know. I have choreographed
multi-pronged amphibious landings and stealth air attacks! Do you think
I have the stomach to whip this production into shape, or not?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: … What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Nothing… It’s stupid… Scott. I called him in
his room, another girl picked up the phone. I know it’s no big deal. I
don’t know why I let it get to me.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: I don’t see what you see in this guy.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: It’s just nice to think someone’s thinking
about you, you know?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: It won’t happen again.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: … No wait! …What are you gonna do? You’re not
gonna hurt him are you? Promise you won’t touch him.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Okay. I promise. I won’t touch him.</p>
<p><strong>ulu</strong>: Tell me a story.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Okay. Let’s see. Once there was a family of
Elves.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: One day, the little Elf family – Uh. Went
into the magic forest. To find a secret gnome… facility, where gnomes
where turning mushrooms into… Uranium. The elves had to go in and take
it out.</p>
<p><strong>ulu</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: They were ordered to. By the Elf Unit
commander at Elf station bravo. So – they waited for cloud cover, and
they came in from the north…</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: The Elf Team decided on an L Ambush – so
three elves formed a base leg and laid down a heavy suppressive fire on
the gnomes while the others maneuvered around to the right flank and
walked through finishing off anything left alive… I mean standing… D</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: … And not one Elf got left behind that day.
We got `em all. Even, the teeniest little elf of all – Rodriquez.</p>
<p><strong>odd</strong>: You have to do the Panda Dance… or he won’t
stop.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Oh, c’mon… I can’t remember that thing.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: I’ll write it down for you…</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: When you’re down and low, lower than the
floor. And you ain’t got a chance. Don’t make a move `til you’re in the
groove, and do the Panda Dance…</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: You have to do the dance. Like dad used to do.
He made it up for him.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Just hop three times like a kangaroo –
Sidestep twice, just like the crabs do.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Take three steps forward and one step
back…</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: What are you looking at?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Today you drive.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: But – I can’t even pass driver’s Ed.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Have you given a driving lesson before?</p>
<p><strong>n</strong>: ot in a car, no… but it’s a lot like a Bradley
Assault Vehicle.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Especially when Zoe’s driving.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Do you know what causes most accidents?
ttention span. The most important thing is that you keep an absolute
focus on…</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: THE ROAD! Don’t look at me…</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: What?!?</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: You wanna drive?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: No. Keep going. I trust you.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Good. Next lesson, 1500 hours.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Ha ha ha. Very funny.</p>
<p><strong>t</strong>: hey head into the school. Shane spots
something.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: I know 437 ways to hurt a man without
touching him. Broken promises lead to broken legs. Do we understand each
other?</p>
<p><strong>principal claire</strong>: Now… WALK! DOUBLE TIME.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Wow. I’m glad I never had you for a CO.</p>
<p><strong>principal claire</strong>: I’ve noticed improvement in your
troops lately, too. Noon and none of them have been called to my office.
It’s a miracle.</p>
<p><strong>s</strong>: he sits beside him, and offers him a milk.</p>
<p><strong>rincipal claire</strong>: Buy you a drink, sailor?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: You look nice today.</p>
<p><strong>principal claire</strong>: This old thing? Well, you never
know who you’re going to run into.</p>
<p><strong>principal claire</strong>: … Love it when he does that.</p>
<p><strong>murney</strong>: I’ve had it. I just caught this boy dancing
under the bleachers like some kind of Bavarian fruitcake.</p>
<p><strong>murney</strong>: I want this freak outta my school and into
treatment. Somebody needs to give this punk a talking to…</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Hey. I’m right here. Talk.</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: veryone is shocked that Todd talked back. A
hushed whisper goes through the cafeteria. Murney turns around.</p>
<p><strong>murney</strong>: You got something to say? Boy?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Yeah. Yeah I do. I quit, Murney.</p>
<p><strong>murney</strong>: Winners never quit, boy. What’re you so
scared of, Freak?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: I am not scared. I… I want to sing.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: I’m in Sound of Music. It opens Friday…</p>
<p><strong>murney</strong>: A musical? You’re blowing off wrestling for
a musical? This is what happens when there’s no man in the house.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: There is a man in my house – me. Let’s get one
thing clear. I’m not quitting cause I hate wresting. I’m quitting
because you’re a bad coach. You suck. The whole team wants to quit. I’m
the only one with the guts to do it.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: urney looks over at the Team. They look to the
ground sheepishly, Todd’s telling the truth. Murney looks around,
humiliated, furious –</p>
<p><strong>urney</strong>: So – you’re a tough guy now?</p>
<p><strong>murney</strong>: Stay out of this, baby sitter!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: You said you wanted to wrestle. You win.
Let’s do it.</p>
<p><strong>murney</strong>: After school. The Gym. Your ass is mine.</p>
<p><strong>a quick series of shots</strong>: Of STUDENTS whispering to
other STUDENTS, passing notes: A Kid opens a note – it reads: “Murney’s
getting his ass kicked. 3:00.”</p>
<p><strong>urney</strong>: on, you’re about to enter Murney’s house of
pain.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: I’ll be sure to lock up when I’m through.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Pinned!</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Is he okay?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Dislocated nerve, that’s all. He’ll be fine
in two months.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: That was awesome.</p>
<p><strong>s</strong>: smiles at her as he passes. She gives him a
thumbs up.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Let’s go, Todd. I got my troops waiting.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: If you’re ever lost in the woods, the first
thing you have to do is find a source of drinking water! And make sure
it’s potable. If you’re not sure, boil it for thirty minutes!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: You have to eat, right? Well let me tell you
you’re not gonna find Girl Scout cookies out here.</p>
<p><strong>lulu</strong>: We’re Brownies.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: No brownies either. A lot of roots are
edible. So is some tree bark. When I HALO’d into Rwanda, I lived off the
underground fern stem for three weeks!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Insects. They look nasty but they’re full of
nutrients that may save your life.</p>
<p><strong>brownie</strong>: He’s eating Roly-Polies!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Wots of pwotien!</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: UPBEAT MUSIC kicks in over the following
MONTAGE:</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Okay – we’ll put Von Trapps here, here, and…
here at the top of the stairs. Now the Nazis are gonna come in, this way
– and the Von Trapp is set…</p>
<p><strong>odd</strong>: … your life little girl, is an empty page/that
men will want to write on…</p>
<p><strong>t</strong>: odd tries the spinning kick, but blows it,
landing hard. Shane blows a WHISTLE.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Why don’t we just let the Nazis win tonight –
huh? Now. From the top – think of yourself as a gazelle prancing over
the plains. Graceful.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Gazelle. Prancing. Graceful. Again.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Don’t touch that dial sleep for a while –
HEAAAY! And say good night, Peter Panda.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Good night, Peter.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Good night, daddy.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: I’m not your daddy, Peter. But sweet
dreams.</p>
<p><strong>gly cub scout</strong>: Hey Skeever, what’s in a Girl Scout’s
pants when she has diarrhea?</p>
<p><strong>2nd scout</strong>: Brown…</p>
<p><strong>lulu</strong>: Go away and we won’t hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>gly cub scout</strong>: Gimme that!</p>
<p><strong>lulu</strong>: Uh oh. You’re gonna have to pay for that.</p>
<p><strong>ugly cub scout</strong>: Let go! Let go – MOMMY!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: That’s my troop.</p>
<p><strong>lulu</strong>: From now on, you do things our way – no
highway option!</p>
<p><strong>brownies</strong>: I don’t care what has been said, Brownies
rock! Full speed ahead! Give me guff, I’m in your face! Brownies rule
the human race!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Sound off!</p>
<p><strong>brownies</strong>: One two! Three four! One TWO THREE
FOUR!</p>
<p><strong>- lulu’s room</strong>: LULU is asleep.</p>
<p><strong>- todd’s room</strong>: The door is OPEN – Shane peers in.
Todd has a SWITCHBLADE. He is practicing with it, clicking it open,
tossing it hand to hand. Off Shane’s look:</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: West Side Story auditions in two weeks…</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: It’s all in the wrist…</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Don’t worry. I’m not gonna jump.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: What’s wrong… Scott?</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: o. Scott’s fine. I don’t know what you did, but
he’s really straightened up. Flowers, phone calls. …I’ve never been in
love like this before.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: How long you been together?</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: A month…</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: That’s longer than any relationship I’ve ever
had.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: You’re okay, Shane. I’m not used to anyone
giving me the benefit of the doubt. My teachers don’t trust me. Mom
doesn’t. My dad didn’t care about us, he was never here…</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Hey. Your father cared about you very deeply.
He told me you were the greatest things in his life. That what’s
bothering you? Cause – we can talk about it, if you want.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: I miss him so much…</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: This was my dad’s. He was the only family I
ever had. Mom left when I was little, cause dad was always gone. Two
years in… an indisclosable locale. Another six in… Another indisclosable
locale. I didn’t really have a home, so I went to military school – then
one day my mom got the letter. No more dad.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: I always wanted to be just like him. I’m
starting to realize, I never really knew him. I don’t know if I’m like
him or not.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: That’s horrible, Shane.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: The hardest part was living without any
details…why? How? Where? I always wondered if he thought about me.</p>
<p><strong>oe</strong>: Me too. So how did you get through it?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: You could say I just shut down my emotions. I
turned off all feelings and dedicated myself to becoming the perfect
soldier.</p>
<p><strong>oe</strong>: I never even got to say good bye.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: The red tape is cleared up, we’re on the
first plane in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Mommy’s coming home! Mommy’s coming home!</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Tomorrow morning!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Mama!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Just another assignment. No reason for
personal attachments.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Hey Gary, your wings aren’t clipped. How come
you don’t fly away?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: I guess you’ve got it good. Kids to play
with. Three squares a day.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: All quiet on the western front. I guess I
better fix that Playroom window.</p>
<p><strong>s</strong>: hane rises.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: What happened, Gary?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: What do you suppose this is?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Sir! Excellent news. I think I found</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: … Do you have it?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: No. It’s in a steel vault. I’ve been trying
all night, can’t crack it, sir.</p>
<p><strong>ill</strong>: Good! Good work. Okay, don’t do anything
further. We’ll be there shortly – don’t do anything `til I get
there.</p>
<p><strong>w</strong>: e PUSH INTO the house. Through a window…
revealing the Korean neighbors standing in the dark. Silently spying on
Shane. An ominous pause.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: One things for sure. After we turn this in to
my CO, whoever’s been bothering you guys won’t be bothering you
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: What’s wrong, Lulu? You should be happy.</p>
<p><strong>lulu</strong>: But, Shane – does that mean you’ll have to
go?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: You guys better get ready. Your mom should be
home soon.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I had a fight with Zoe when I left, so they
probably trashed the place…</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>j</strong>: JULIE’S P.O.V.: The house is spotless. The rug is
vacuumed. The fish tank is clear, filled with healthy</p>
<p><strong>kids voices</strong>: … with songs they have sung, for a
thousand years…</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Welcome home, mom.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Captain.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Good job, Lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>ill</strong>: I’m really proud of you, Shane. I’m giving you
your choice of assignment, anywhere you want. You just name it.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: That’s kind of you, Sir… But I’ll have to
think about it.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Sir, all I’ve never known is the military. At
nine years old my father put me in cadet school and from there I never
looked back. Don’t get me wrong, I wouldn’t trade it for anything and I
have no regrets…</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I should hope not.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: But being with these kids has made me feel
like there’s more to life than taking out your enemy. And I think I want
to explore that some more.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chun</strong>: Give US THE KEY!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Mr. and Mrs. Chun? They checked out-</p>
<p><strong>h</strong>: ands up!</p>
<p><strong>korean man</strong>: You promised us GHOST months ago!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I’m sorry, Mr. Chun. There were delays…</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: He won’t be baby-sitting you anymore.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I trusted you. Charles trusted you. So did
the Department of Defense.</p>
<p><strong>ill</strong>: North Korea pays better. Keep an eye on them.
You – with me.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You bring your stethoscope?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chun</strong>: No. But I’ve got some C4.</p>
<p><strong>ill</strong>: Charles never made things easy.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chun</strong>: Just… had eyebrows… done.</p>
<p><strong>mr. chun</strong>: Think I’m stupid? Now stop bothering
me.</p>
<p><strong>oe</strong>: Now Peter!</p>
<p><strong>oe</strong>: Let’s GO!</p>
<p><strong>lulu</strong>: Hi ya!</p>
<p><strong>mr. chun</strong>: That’s cute.</p>
<p><strong>mr. chun</strong>: That stuff doesn’t hurt.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Keep going! RUN! Go GET HELP!!!</p>
<p><strong>zoe/todd</strong>: Hurry! C’mon! Buckle up!!</p>
<p><strong>rs. chun</strong>: They’re headed for the car!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Relax – I’ve got the keys, they’re not going
anywhere…</p>
<p><strong>oe</strong>: Omigod! What are we doing??!</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Let’s look for a cop!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: How does it work?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: How does what work?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Don’t play dumb. It’s getting old. I want to
know how to get through the booby traps. What’s the code?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I don’t know any code – Charles didn’t tell
me about the room…</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: If I knew Charles had hidden it so well, I
wouldn’t have killed him so soon. Don’t make me kill you too.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chun</strong>: Mr. Bill, my husband has question:</p>
<p><strong>mr. chun</strong>: I have a clean shot at their tires.
It’s</p>
<p><strong>b</strong>: risky, they might wreck…</p>
<p><strong>ill</strong>: … Do it.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Bill, don’t hurt the kids.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: I know the code. I’ll get you in… just please
don’t hurt anyone.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Change of plan. Bring them back unharmed.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: What’s taking you?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Don’t wait for me!</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Now!</p>
<p><strong>r. chun</strong>: Aah! HEY –</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Wheee!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Anybody got any perfume? Hair spray… breath
freshener…</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Zoe, Todd, Lulu, Peter, Tyler!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: The key is the kid’s names. Watch.</p>
<p><strong>ill</strong>: You think this is a game?!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: But… That was the code! I swear! I saw
Plummer use it on his briefcase.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Code or no code, go get it – now.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: You can’t make him do this – He doesn’t have
a chance.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Haven’t got a chance.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: … When you’re down and low, lower than the
floor. And you haven’t got a chance. Don’t make a move `til you’re in
the groove, and do the Peter Panda Dance.</p>
<p><strong>s</strong>: facing forwards:</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Just hop three times like a kangaroo –</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Sidestep twice, just like the crabs do.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Three steps forward and one step back.</p>
<p><strong>lulu</strong>: Look out Zoe! Rollers!</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Come on. Use the gas, not the brake, 5-0.</p>
<p><strong>cute cop</strong>: I’d say you could lose your license – but
you haven’t got one!</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: People are trying to kill us. They have my mom,
and our bodyguard – you have to follow me!</p>
<p><strong>cute cop</strong>: Just pull over!</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Fine. Don’t follow me!</p>
<p><strong>murney</strong>: That Baloney Bandit struck again. I accept
full responsibility. My intelligence proved to be faulty, but if I had
more resources…</p>
<p><strong>murney</strong>: I told you not to pass her in Driver’s
Ed.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Wriggle like a snake `til you can’t no more.
Then better jump quick, like there ain’t no floor.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Almost done, almost done… “Just hold your
breath, and jump to the left.”</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: And that’s the Peter Panda Dance.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Thank you, Shane. You were always my best man.
I knew you’d figure it out.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You know, if you’re willing to join up, I’d be
happy to cut you in on the proceeds. What do you say – we make a good
team?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: I was devoted to you, sir. And you betrayed
all of that. All that we stand for.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I’ll take that as a “no.”</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: … I think you better open it.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Wait. That’s just what you want isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You open it.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Oh come on. I walked the floor first.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: There will be no mercy.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: None requested.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: You’re a… terrible neighbor.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Shane! Watch out!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Any last words?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: … Say, good night, Peter Panda!</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Zoe! You’re going too fast!! You’re not gonna
have enough time to stop-</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Hey, I’M the one in Driver’s Ed! I think I know
what I’m doing!!</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Thank you Shane. It’s finally over. Now we
can go back to our peaceful…</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Whoa, WHOA! What are you doing to these
kids??</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: But, officer…</p>
<p><strong>cute cop</strong>: I said FREEZE. Zoe, you’re in a lot of
trouble… Reckless endangerment! Driving without a license. Numerous, uh…
trafficS violations –</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: These kids are heroes. They just aided in
exposing a high-level espionage ring. I suggest you call the FBI.
Now.</p>
<p><strong>cute cop</strong>: You expect me to believe any of that?</p>
<p><strong>principal claire</strong>: Ya!!</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: I think I’ll call the FBI.</p>
<p><strong>.b.i. agent</strong>: Mr. Wolfe… that was nice work. You’re a
one-man battalion.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Just doing my job.</p>
<p><strong>f.b.i. agent</strong>: The Bureau is always looking for good
men. Do you have a card or something?</p>
<p><strong>lulu</strong>: Do you have to wear that thing in your ear all
the time?</p>
<p><strong>fbi agent</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>lulu</strong>: Does it itch?</p>
<p><strong>fbi agent</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: If you’re reading this, then Julie found the
key. Julie, Tyler, Peter, Zoe, Todd, Lulu – I want to say: I love you
more than anything. I always have.</p>
<p><strong>principal claire</strong>: So. What happens now? You’ll be
stationed somewhere else, right? I guess there’s no more reason for you
to stick around here.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Well. I’m kinda, re-conning the situation,
here… And to tell the truth. I don’t see anything but reasons to
stay.</p>
<p><strong>rincipal claire</strong>: So… What’s the next move?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: … I don’t know. I’m on dry land. You’re the
superior office. You tell me.</p>
<p><strong>principal claire</strong>: Well. Summer’s almost here. What
if you and me did a little amphibious recon mission. On, say – Maui?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Sir yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>lulu</strong>: This is it. Your work here is through. Guess
you have to go now…</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Ah, come here you.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: But…</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: He would’ve wanted me to give it to someone I
care about. Like he did. Thank you. For everything.</p>
<p><strong>eter</strong>: Love you, Shane.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Your dad would be so proud.</p>
<p><strong>lulu</strong>: Shane, we’re never gonna see you again!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: What are you talking about? I’m gonna see you
Friday night.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: What’s Friday night?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Tonight is the night we trained for, and
failure is not an option! No detail is too small! We are the BEST!
Remember your lines, hit your marks, and stay in character! I expect
perfection!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Now let’s break a leg.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: YESSS! Huu-ah!</p>
