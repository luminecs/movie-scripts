<p><strong>john</strong>: Eh … pardon me for asking but who’s that
little old man?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What little old man?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That little old man.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Oh, that one. That’s me Grandfather.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: That’s not your Grandfather.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It is, y’know.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: But your Grandfather lives in your house.
I’ve seen him.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Oh, that’s me other Grandfather, but this
one’s me Grandfather and all.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: How d’you reckon that one out?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Well … everyone’s entitled to two, aren’t
they, and this is me other one.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Well we know that but what’s he doing
here?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Well, me mother thought the trip ’ud do him
good.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: How’s that?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Oh … he’s nursing a broken heart.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Aah … the poor old thing.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Eh, Mister… are you nursing a broken heart
then?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You see, he was going to get married but she
threw him over for a butcher.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: A butcher?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yeah, she was fickle.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Aye and fond of fresh meat and all.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No … it was his sweetbreads. She was dead
kinky for sweetbreads. Anyroad, me mother thought it’ud give him a
change of scenery, like.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh, I see.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Eh, he’s a nice old man, isn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Oh yeah, he’s very clean, y’know.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hello, Grandfather!</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: He can talk then?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Course he can talk. He’s a human being, like.
Isn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Well … if he’s your Grandfather, who
knows?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: And we’re looking after him, are we?</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: I’ll look after meself.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Aye, that’s what I’m afraid of!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: He’s got you worried, then?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Him, he costs you a fortune in breach of
promise cases. He’s a villain and a right mixer as well.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Gerron.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No, straight up.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: The lad’s given you the simple truth.
I’m cursed wid irresistible charm, I’m too attractive to be let
loose.</p>
<p><strong>shake</strong>: You got on all right then?</p>
<p><strong>boys</strong>: Hi, Shake.</p>
<p><strong>shake</strong>: We’re here. Norm’ll be along in a mo’ with
the tickets.</p>
<p><strong>shake</strong>: Morning! Who’s that little old man?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: It’s Paul’s grandfather.</p>
<p><strong>shake</strong>: Oh aye, but I thought …</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No, that’s his other one.</p>
<p><strong>shake</strong>: That’s all right then.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Clean though, isn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>shake</strong>: Oh yes, he’s clean all right.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Morning, lads.</p>
<p><strong>boys</strong>: Morning … Hi, Norm.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Well, thank God you’re all got here. Now,
listen, I’ve had this marvellous idea … now just for a change, let’s all
behave like ordinary responsible citizens. Let’s not cause any trouble,
pull any strokes or do anything I’m going to be sorry for, especially
tomorrow at the television theatre, because …</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Are you listening to me, Lennon?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You’re a swine, isn’t he George?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah … a swine.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Thanks…</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Eh … .</p>
<p><strong>boys in chorus</strong>: … Who’s that little old man?</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Well, who is he?</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: He belongs to Paul.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Ah well, there you go. Look, I’m going down
the diner for a cup of coffee, are you coming?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: We’ll follow you down.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: I want me coffee.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: He can come with Shake and me if you like.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Well, look after him. I don’t want to find
you’ve lost him.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Don’t be cheeky, I’ll bind him to me with
promises. Come on, Grandad.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: He’s very clean, isn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: Make up your minds, will you!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Do you mind if we have it opened?</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: Yes, I do.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah, but there are four of us, like, and we’d
like it open, if it’s all the same to you, that is.</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: Well, it isn’t. I travel on this train
regularly twice a week, so I suppose I’ve some rights.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Aye, well, so have we.</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: And we’ll have that thing off as well,
thank you.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: But I …</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: An elementary knowledge of the Railway Acts
would tell you I’m perfectly within my rights.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yeah, but we want to hear it and there’s more
of us than you. We’re a community, like, a majority vote. Up the workers
and all that stuff!</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: Then I suggest you take that damned thing
into the corridor or some other part of the train where you obviously
belong.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Gie’s a kiss!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Shurrup! Look, Mister, we’ve paid for our
seats too, you know.</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: I travel on this train regularly, twice a
week.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Knock it off, Paul, y’ can’t win with his
sort. After all, it’s his train, isn’t it, Mister?</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: And don’t you take that tone with me, young
man!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: But…</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: I fought the war for your sort.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Bet you’re sorry you won!</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: I’ll call the guard!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Aye … but what? They don’t take kindly to
insults you know. Ah, come on, you lot. Let’s get a cup of coffee and
leave Toby the manger.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Eh, Mister … can we have our ball back!</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Yeah, you want to watch it.</p>
<p><strong>shake</strong>: It’s not my fault.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Well, you stick to that story, son.</p>
<p><strong>shake</strong>: I can’t help it, I’m just taller than
you.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: They always say that.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Yeah, well I got me eye on you.</p>
<p><strong>shake</strong>: I’m sorry Norm, but I can’t help being taller
than you.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Well, you don’t have to rub me nose in it.
I’ve a good mind to …</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: If you’re going to have a barney I’ll hold
your coats.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: He started it.</p>
<p><strong>shake</strong>: No, I didn’t you did …</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, what happened?</p>
<p><strong>shake</strong>: The old fella wanted these pictures and Norm
said he couldn’t have ‘em, all I said was ’aw go on, be big about
it.’</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Your Grandfather pointed out Shake was always
being taller than me just to spite me.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I knew it, <U>he</U> started it, I should have
known.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Y’what?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You two have never had a quarrel in your life
and in two minutes flat he’s got you at it. He’s a king mixer. Adam and
Eve, meet the serpent. Anthony and Cleopatra, there’s your asp. Divide
and Conquer, that’s this one’s motto. He hates group unity so he gets
everyone at it.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Aye and we’ll have to watch it and all.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I suggest you just give him the photos and
have done with it.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: You’re right. Here you are, old devil.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Would you ever sign this one for us,
Pauly?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Come on let’s get this coffee.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Before you go, I think it’s only fair
to warn you about me Grandson … don’t let our Paul have his own way all
the time, ’cos if you do he won’t respect you!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh, Paul, you can’t have your own way!!!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: If I let you have your own way, you little
rascal, will you respect me?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’ll murder you, Grandfather!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Eh, look at that talent.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Give ’em a pull.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Shall I?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Aye, but don’t rush. None of your five bar
gate jumps and over sort of stuff.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Now what’s that supposed to mean?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I don’t really know, but it sounded
distinguished, like, didn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: George Harrison, The Scouse of
Distinction.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Excuse me, but these young men I’m sitting
with wondered if two of us could join you; I’d ask you meself only I’m
shy.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: I’m sorry, miss, but you mustn’t
fraternise with my prisoners.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Prisoners!!</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Convicts in transit to Wormwood Scrubs.
Typical old lags, the lot of ’em.</p>
<p><strong>the boys</strong>: Y’what!!!</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Quiet, you lot, or I’ll give you a
touch of me truncheon. That little one’s the worst. If we don’t keep him
on tablets he has fits.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Now look here!!</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Get out while you can, ladies, his
time’s coming round for one of his turns.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: He’s been gone a long time.</p>
<p><strong>shake</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Paul’s grandfather.</p>
<p><strong>shake</strong>: Oh, I didn’t notice, where’d he go?</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Down the … er …</p>
<p><strong>shake</strong>: Oh, down the … er …?</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Yeah, down the … er …</p>
<p><strong>shake</strong>: Well, give a couple of minutes …</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Yes, I’m their manager, I discovered
them.</p>
<p><strong>lady audrey</strong>: Did you indeed, Mr. McCartney?</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Now, Audrey, I told you, the name’s
John. We show biz people are a friendly lot.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Of course, John.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Yes, they were playing the queues
outside the picture palaces of Liverpool. Scruffy young lads, lacking
even the price of a jam roll. Orphans, every Paddy’s son of ’em. I saw
their potential at once although I had me doubts about the little fella,
a savage primitive, that Ringo, but it was him what gave in first. He
picked up a brick and heaved it at me and I quelled him wid one fierce
flash of me eyes. “Mister, can you spare us a copper?” he said. I was
disarmed by the grubby little outstretched mauler … So, I took them
under me managerial banner.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: The usual ten per cent?</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Oh, not at all, I let them have
twenty-five; sure aren’t there four of them?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: How fascinating. Do go on … … John.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: … Oh, I’m all heart, Ma’am, all heart …
Well, I let …</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Eh, have you got Paul’s grandfather?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Of course, he’s concealed about me person.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: No … he’s must have slipped off somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Have <U>you</U> lost him?</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Don’t exaggerate.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You’ve lost him.</p>
<p><strong>shake</strong>: Put it this way, he’s mislaid him.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You can’t trust you with anything, Norm, if
you’ve lost him, I’ll cripple you.</p>
<p><strong>shake</strong>: He can’t be far.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I hope he fell off.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Don’t be callous.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: He doesn’t like me, honest, I can tell … It’s
’cos I’m little.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You’ve got an inferiority complex, you
have.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Yeah, I know, that’s why I took up the drums.
It’s me active compensatory factor.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Are you going in?</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: No, she’ll only reject me in the end and I’ll
be frustrated.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You never know, you might be lucky this
time.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: No, I know the psychological pattern and it
plays hell with me drum skins.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Excuse me but have you seen that little old
man we were with?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: We’ve broken out, oh, the blessed freedom of
it all! Eh, have you got a nail file, these handcuffs are killing me. I
was framed. I was innocent.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Will you stop it! Sorry to disturb you,
miss…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I was innocent. I was framed. I won’t go
back.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I bet you can guess what I was in for.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: How about that one?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Did you look in here?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No. I mean, it’s probably a honeymoon couple
or a company director or something.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Well, let’s broaden our outlook.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Congratulate me, boys, I’m engaged.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Oh no, you’re not. You’ve gone too far this
time … and who’s paying for all this?</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: It’s all taken care of. It’s down on
our bill.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Oh, well that’s all right. What?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Young man, kindly moderate your tone when
you address my fiance.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m sorry, Missus, but the betrothal’s off.
I’ll refuse me consent, he’s over-age!</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Leave him alone, after all he’s done for you
is this the way you repay him?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Him? he’s never done anything for anybody in
his life.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: You dare to say that when even those
ridiculous clothes you are wearing were bought when you forced him to
sell out his gilt edged Indomitables!!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Come on, Auntie, you’re winning.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Get in there, Paul, she’s weakening.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Look, Missus, this is all a misunderstanding,
you see, he’s …</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Keep away from me, you depraved lout, I know
all about your terrible past.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Y’what?</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: He’s given me a bad character, blackguarding
me name to all and sundry. He’s got to be stopped. It’s not fair.</p>
<p><strong>voice off</strong>: That’s one of them … stop thief!</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Oh Mother!!</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: And to think me own grandson would have
let them put me behind bars!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Don’t dramatise.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Let’s face it, you’re lucky to be here. If
they’d have had their way you’d have been dropped off at Stafford
already.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Well, you’ve got to admit you’ve upset a lot
of people. At least I can keep my eye on you while you’re stuck in
here.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: All right, how about Ringo? I mean … he’s very
upset, you know … and as far as your girlfriend, little Audrey’s
concerned, she’s finished with men for the rest of her natural, and
another thing …</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: A harmless bit of fun, aah, none of you
have any sense of humour left these days.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Oh, it’s all right for you but those two girls
were scared to death! Honest, Grandad, why? I mean, why do you do these
things?</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: You’re left-handed, aren’t you,
Paul?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yeah … so what?</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Why do you always use your left
hand?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Well, don’t be daft, I’ve got to.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: And I take a left-handed view of life,
I’ve got to.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Shove up!</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Odds or evens?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Odds.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Don’t worry, son, we’ll get you the best
lawyer trading stamps can buy.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Oh, it’s a laugh a line with Lennon. Anyroad
up … It’s all your fault.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Me? Why?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Bag-snatcher.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: That’s right; convict without trial …
Habeas corpus.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Every morning.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Gaw, it’s depressing in here, isn’t it? Funny…
’cos they usually reckon dogs more than people in England, don’t they?
You’d expect something a little more palatial. Come on. Let’s have a
little action. Let’s do something, then.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Well, I’ve got me gob stopper. Look, a genuine
Stradivarius, hand tooled at Dagenham.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Don’t move, any of you. They’ve gone potty out
there. The whole place is surging with girls.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Please, can I have one to surge with?</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Ah, go on, you swine.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: No, you can’t. Look, as soon as I tell you,
run through this door here and into the big car that’s waiting.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Oh no!</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: All right, lads, follow me.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Vive l’amour!</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Go like the clappers, son!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: That was my entire intention, sir.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: I don’t snore.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You do - repeatedly.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Do I snore?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You’re a window rattler, son.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Well, that’s just your opinion. Do I snore,
Paul?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: With a trombone hooter like yours it’d be
unnatural if you didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Don’t mock the afflicted, Pauly.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Oh for Pete’s sake, It’s only a joke.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Well, it may be a joke, but it’s his
nose. He can’t help having a horrible great nose, it’s the only one he’s
got. And his poor little head’s trembling under the weight of it.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Paul, John, George - get at it.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hello the income tax have caught up with us at
last.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: None for me, then?</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That’ll keep you busy.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: It’s your nose, y’see. Fans are funny
that way. Take a dislike to things. They’ll pick on a nose…</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: You go and pick on your own.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Is that yours?</p>
<p><strong>shake</strong>: For Ringo.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That must have cost you a fortune in stamps,
Ringo.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: He comes from a large family.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Well.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Eh, what’s Boyd’s Club?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: “The Management of Boyd’s takes pleasure in
requesting the company of Mr. Richard Starkey, that’s you, in their
recently refinished gaming rooms. Chemin de Fer. Baccarat, Roulette, and
Champagne Buffet.” Blimey!</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: And they want me?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh, it’s got round that you’re a heavy
punter.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Well you’re not going.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Ah.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Quite right, invites to gambling dens
full of easy money and fast women, chicken sandwiches and cornets of
caviar, disgusting!</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: That’s mine.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Have done, and you lot get your pens out.</p>
<p><strong>boys</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: It’s homework time for all you college
puddings. I want this lot all answered tonight.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: I’ll brook no denial!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It’s all right for you, you couldn’t get a pen
in your foot, you swine.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Come on, Shake, we’ll leave ’em to their
penmanship.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: While the swine’s away the piglets can play.
Well, come on, what are we waiting for?</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: What about all these letters?</p>
<p><strong>boys</strong>: Read ’em!</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: And a free champagne buffet.</p>
<p><strong>dealer</strong>: Alors, M’sieur?</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Soufl�e.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: I bet you’re a great swimmer. My turn?
Bingo!</p>
<p><strong>croupier</strong>: Pas “Bingo,” M’sieur… Banco.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: I’ll take the little darlings
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Two and one is three, carry one is
four.</p>
<p><strong>blonde</strong>: Lay them down.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Eh?</p>
<p><strong>blonde</strong>: Lay them down.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: We’d be thrown out.</p>
<p><strong>blonde</strong>: Your cards… lay them down… face up.</p>
<p><strong>croupier</strong>: Huit � la pointe… et sept.</p>
<p><strong>blonde</strong>: You had a lovely little pair, y’see.</p>
<p><strong>blonde</strong>: They’re yours.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: They are?</p>
<p><strong>blonde</strong>: The cards… you’re bank.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Bingo!</p>
<p><strong>croupier</strong>: M’lord dit “Bingo.”</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: A little light refreshment.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: A glass of the old chablis to wash down
a gesture of giblets wouldn’t go amiss. Soufl�e, chop chop.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Now get on with it.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: We were going to do it.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Aye, well, now!</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Any of you lot put a man in that
cupboard?</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: A man? No.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Well somebody did.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: He’s right, y’know.</p>
<p><strong>boys</strong>: Ah well, there you go.</p>
<p><strong>shake</strong>: Eh, what’s all this?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Oh, him… He’s been lurking.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Aye, he looks a right lurker.</p>
<p><strong>shake</strong>: You’re undressed. Where are your clothes?</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: The old gentlemen borrowed them to go
gambling at Boyd’s.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Oh, he’s gone to my club, has he?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yeah, It’s all your fault, getting invites to
gambling clubs. He’s probably in the middle of an orgy by now.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Well, what are we waiting for?</p>
<p><strong>shake</strong>: Aye, come on, honest, that grandfather of
yours is worse than any of you lot.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Encore de champagne, Monsieur?</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Yes, and I’ll have some more champagne
as well.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Lord John McCartney, he’s the millionaire
Irish Peer, filthy rich of course.</p>
<p><strong>customer</strong>: Oh I don’t know, looks rather clean to
me.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Play is about to resume, m’lord.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Lead me to it, I’ve a winning itch that
only success can pacify.</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: I’m sorry sir, members and invited guests
only.</p>
<p><strong>paul, george, ringo, john</strong>: I’ve got to get in. It’s
urgent and important. I’ve had an invite. Take me to your leader.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Shurrup.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: All we want to know is have you got a little
old man in there?</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Do you mean Lord McCartney?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: He’s at it again. Look, I’m his grandfather… I
mean…</p>
<p><strong>blonde</strong>: Oh, it must be the dolly floor show.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Stay where you are everybody this is a raid
and we want him.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Who are these ruffians?… I’ve never
seen them before in my life! …</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Before you go, gentlemen, there’s the small
matter of the bill.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: I’ll settle that.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: A hundred and eighty pounds!</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: I beg your pardon, guineas.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Your winnings, my lord, one hundred and
ninety pounds.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: How about me change?</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Cloak room charge.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Ah well, easy come, easy go.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Well.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Should I say it?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Follow your impulse.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: It’ll only get you into trouble.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Aah, shurrup, misery!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: O.K. Driver, follow that car!!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Would you like to be a little more precise,
sir?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Well, that’s the wrong line for a start.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Sorry?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh, don’t pay any attention to him, he was
just fulfilling a lifelong ambition.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah, you know, “O.K. Buster, follow that car,
there’s a sawbuck in it for you if you get real close!”</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Oh, yes, now I’m with you. But, gee, Mister,
I’ve got my license to think of … we’re doing a hundred now …</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Ever seen one of these before?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Ah … a shamus, eh?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I see you go to the night court.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’ve made the scene.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Well, remember, its Leathery Magee up ahead in
that convertible, so cover me in the stake-out.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I don’t think that bit’s right.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What do you expect from an ad lib … Raymond
Chandler?</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Will you all stop it, you’re like a gang of
school kids. I knew this was going to happen one day.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Well, you shouldn’t have had bacon for your
breakfast, you cannibal.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: We’re nearly there, sir.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Eh … don’t call him sir, he’s got enough
delusions of power as it is.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: And I was happy in the bakery. I’ll never know
why I left.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Get ready John, open the door and as it draws
up, out you go and straight in.</p>
<p><strong>first p.r.o. man</strong>: Press conference, they’re waiting
for you.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Give us a couple of shakes to get our
breath.</p>
<p><strong>first p.r.o. man</strong>: They’re waiting <U>now</U>!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Eh this lot means it. They’re even taking
hostages.</p>
<p><strong>sound reporter</strong>: What’s your philosophy of life?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m torn between Zen and I’m all right,
Jack.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Has success changed your life?</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Do you like playing the guitar?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Next to kissing girls it’s favourites.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No, actually, we’re just good friends.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Anything to spare?</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: We’ve just finished, Pauly. Hey George,
write us your John Henry on this picture.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Sure. .</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Ah well. Eh, look!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Let’s go and muck in.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Aye, before anyone stops us.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Here, what about these electric guitars?</p>
<p><strong>shake</strong>: Where are they?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Back here, mate.</p>
<p><strong>shake</strong>: I’m coming.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Leave them drums alone.</p>
<p><strong>floor manager</strong>: Oh, surely one can have a tiny
touch.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: If you so much as breathe heavy on them, I’m
out on strike.</p>
<p><strong>floor manager</strong>: Aren’t you being rather
arbitrary?</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: That’s right retreat behind a smoke screen of
bourgeois cliches. I don’t go round messing about with your ear-phones,
do I?</p>
<p><strong>floor manager</strong>: Spoil sport!</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Well!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: He’s very touchy about those his drums, they
loom large in his legend.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: He’s sulking again.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’ll show him.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: All right I’m sorry and let’s hear no more
about it. If that’s your opinion, you’re probably right. Look, if you
think I’m unsuitable let’s have it out in the open, I can’t stand these
back-stage politics.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Aren’t you tending to black and white this
whole situation?</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Well, quite honestly I wasn’t expecting “a
musical arranger” who would question my ability … picture-wise.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I could listen to him for hours.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Heave to, what’s all this about a musical
arranger?</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Mr. McCartney Senior!</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Hey Pauly, they’re trying to fob you
off wid this musical charlatan but I’ve given him the test.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: I’m quite happy to be replaced.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: He’s a typical buck-passer.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: I won an award.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: A likely story.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: It’s on the wall in my office.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Hello our lot, everyone happy?</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: All right, all right. If you don’t need this
lot, I’ll lock ’em up in the dressing room till you do.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Please do, I’ll not need them for fifteen
minutes. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Give me a bottle of milk and a packet of
Oblivion. Oh, it’s a plot, I see it now, it’s all a plot.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Now, come on, I’ve got the key.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Let’s have you.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Come on speedy!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Ringo!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Wake up!</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: I can’t tell you how much I’ve enjoyed
your act.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Gear costume!</p>
<p><strong>actor</strong>: Swap?</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Right, first floor and no messing about.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Lennon, leave them girls alone or I’ll report
you.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: I suppose you know this is private
property.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Sorry if we hurt your field, Mister.</p>
<p><strong>millie</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>millie</strong>: Oh, wait a minute, don’t tell me you’re
…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No, not me.</p>
<p><strong>millie</strong>: Oh you are, I know you are.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No, I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>millie</strong>: You are.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m not, no.</p>
<p><strong>millie</strong>: Well, you look like him.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh do I? You’re the first one who ever said
that.</p>
<p><strong>millie</strong>: Oh you do, look.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: My eyes are lighter.</p>
<p><strong>millie</strong>: Oh yes.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: And my nose…</p>
<p><strong>millie</strong>: Well, yes your nose is. Very.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Is it?</p>
<p><strong>millie</strong>: I would have said so.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Aye, but you know him well.</p>
<p><strong>millie</strong>: No I don’t, he’s only a casual
acquaintance.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That’s what you tell me.</p>
<p><strong>millie</strong>: What have you heard?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It’s all over the place, everyone knows.</p>
<p><strong>millie</strong>: Is it? Is it really?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Mind you, I stood up for you, I mean I
wouldn’t have it.</p>
<p><strong>millie</strong>: I knew I could rely on you.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>millie</strong>: You don’t look like him at all.</p>
<p><strong>shake</strong>: Oh they’ve probably gone to the canteen, cup
of tea, like.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: That’s too easy for Lennon.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: He’s out there somewhere, causing trouble just
to upset me.</p>
<p><strong>shake</strong>: You’re imagining it. You’re letting things
prey on your mind.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Oh no… this is a battle of nerves between John
and me.</p>
<p><strong>shake</strong>: But John hasn’t got any.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>shake</strong>: Nerves.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: I know, that’s the trouble.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Oh, I’ve toyed with the idea of a ball and
chain but he’d only rattle them at me… and in public and all. Sometimes
I think he enjoys seeing me suffer.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Get behind that door, they’re coming.
Someone’s coming. Quick, hide!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What are you doing there?</p>
<p><strong>shake</strong>: Hiding.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I think you’re soft or something.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: We weren’t hiding.</p>
<p><strong>tailor</strong>: Now?</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Now. We were trying to catch you redhanded. I
thought I told you lot to stay here?</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Well …</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: When I tell you to stay put, stay put.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Don’t cane me, sir, I was led astray.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Oh shurrup and come on John. They’re waiting
for you in the studio.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Oh dear, I feel like doing a bit of work.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Good lad, Ringo.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Oh, listen to teacher’s pet.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You crawler.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: He’s betrayed the class.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Oh, leave off!!!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Temper! Temper!</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Well …</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Will you all get a move on! They’re waiting
for you!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I now declare this bridge open.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: All right, hold it, hold it… O.K. John,
wipe him down and we’ll carry on with the next act.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Where are they? I said, where are they?
Where are they?</p>
<p><strong>floor manager</strong>: They’re coming, I promise you.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Now look, if they’re not here on this
floor in thirty seconds there’s going to be trouble … understand me …
trouble!!!</p>
<p><strong>welsh stage hand</strong>: Well … he’s being the director. Of
course, he lives in a world of his own, mind.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Standing about, eh? Some people have it dead
easy, don’t they?</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Of course, once you’re over thirty, you’re
finished. It’s a young man’s medium and I just can’t take the pace.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Are you as young as that, then?</p>
<p><strong>boys</strong>: Shurrup!</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Isn’t it always the way? Picking on us
little fellas.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Shove the gentleman jockey in the make-up room
or something and keep your eye on him, will you?</p>
<p><strong>shake</strong>: I’m an electrician, not a wet nurse,
y’know.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’ll set John on you!</p>
<p><strong>shake</strong>: Oh, anything you say, Paul.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: That was more or less all right for me.
I’ll give them one more run through then leave them alone until the
dress … Oh how about make-up?</p>
<p><strong>make-up woman</strong>: Not really, they don’t need it any.
We’ll just powder them off for shine.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Good. Norm, get them along to make-up will
you?</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: And hurry, they’re not looking too
happy.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What’s the matter with you? You were bashing
away like a madman.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: You were twanging too loud.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: How’d you like a dirty great drum roll giving
you a clout right in the middle of your solo?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You’re getting out of hand. I don’t know
what’s come over you today.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: That’s right. It’s always me, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Since you ask, yes. Aah, come on, Ring, we
love you.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Well!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: He’ll get over it.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: All right, our lot, make-up.]</p>
<p><strong>shake</strong>: You blinked!</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: I never did, you did.</p>
<p><strong>shake</strong>: Hello, he’s not talking to me. He’s having a
sulk.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, it must be catching. He’s given it to
the champ here.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Stop picking on him.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: I don’t need you to defend me, y’know,
Norm.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Leave him alone, he’s got swine fever.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Sit down, the lot of you.</p>
<p><strong>head make up girl</strong>: Oh, this is impossible! We’ll
never get you all done in time.</p>
<p><strong>actor</strong>: Well, you’ll just have to do us first… It
makes no difference to <U>them</U> whether they’re made up or not. And
who’s me, then?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: My name’s Betty… Do you want a punch up your
frogged tunic?</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Now listen, John, behave yourself or I’ll
murder you and, Shake, take that wig off, it suits you.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: What do you think are you’re up to?</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Someone put it on me.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Excuses, that’s all we get and you know you
fancy yourself in the Coldstreams.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You won’t interfere with the basic rugged
concept of my personality, will you, girl?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Eh, don’t take out me lines.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah, they give him that “Je ne sais quoi”
rakish air.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Short back and sides, please.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Behave…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Foreign devil …</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Control yourself…</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: In my considered opinion you’re a bunch
of sissies.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You know you’re only jealous!</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Leave him alone, Lennon, or I’ll tell them all
the truth about you.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You wouldn’t!</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: I would though.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What’s he know?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Nothing, he’s trying to brainwash me and give
me personality doubts … oh, he’s a swine but a clever swine, mind.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Lookit, I thought I was supposed to be
getting a change of scenery and so far I’ve seen a train and a room, a
car and a room and a room and a room. Well, that’s maybe all right for a
bunch of powdered gee-gaws like you lot but I’m feeling decidedly
strait-jacketed. This is no life for a free-booting agent of my stamp.
I’m a frustrated man and that class of McCartney is a dangerous
McCartney.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: What a clean old man.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: You’re too young for a fella of my
cosmopolitan tastes, so don’t press your luck.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: He’s sex-obsessed, the older generation are
leading this country to galloping ruin.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: They’re nearly ready for you. They’re just
finishing the band call.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Gear! Come on, girls, let’s have a bit of a
dance.</p>
<p><strong>john’s girl</strong>: I don’t think its allowed.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Well … it wouldn’t be any fun if it was!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Never.</p>
<p><strong>director’s voice over tannoy</strong>: Thank you gentlemen,
you can break now while we push on with the show.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: That was great, you’ve got about an hour but
don’t leave the theatre.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: She’s going to show me her stamp
collection.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: So’s mine.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: John, I’m talking to you. This final run
through is <U>important</U>. Understand? Important.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oink! Oink!</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: I want me cup of tea.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Shake.</p>
<p><strong>shake</strong>: I’m adjusting the decibels on the
inbalance.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Clever. George.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Look after him.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: But…</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Do I have to raise me voice?</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Oh, all right. Come here, Grandad.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Will you ever look at him, sitting
there wid his hooter scraping away at that book!</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Well … what’s the matter with that?</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Have you no natural resources of your
own? Have they even robbed you of that?</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: You can learn from books.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Can you now? Aah … sheeps’ heads! You
learn more by getting out there and living.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Out where?</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Any old where … but not our little
Richard … oh no! When you’re not thumping them pagan skins, you’re
tormenting your eyes wid that rubbish!</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Books are good!</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Parading’s better!</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Parading?</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: That’s it, parading the streets …
trailing your coat … bowling along … living!</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Well, I <U>am</U> living, aren’t I?</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: You’re living, are you? When was the
last time you gave a girl a pink-edged daisy? When did you last
embarrass a sheila wid your cool appraising stare?</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Eh … you’re a bit old for that sort of chat,
aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: At least I’ve a backlog of memories,
but all you’ve got is that book!</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Aaah … stop picking on me… you’re as bad as
the rest of them.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: So you <U>are</U> a man after all.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: What’s that mean?</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Do you think I haven’t noticed … do you
think I wasn’t aware of the drift? Oh … you poor unfortunate scuff,
they’ve driven you into books by their cruel, unnatural treatment,
exploiting your good nature.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Oh … I dunno.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: And that lot’s never happier than when
they’re jeering at you … and where would they be without the steady
support of your drum beat, I’d like to know.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Yeah … that’s right.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: And what’s it all come to in the
end?</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Yeah … what’s in it for me?</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: A book!</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Yeah … a bloomin’ book!</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: When you could be out there betraying a
rich American widow or sipping palm wine in Tahiti before you’re too old
like me. A fine neat and trim lad the class of you should be helping
himself to life’s goodies before the sands run out. Being an old age
pensioner’s a terrible drag on a man and every second you waste is
bringing you nearer the Friday queue at the Post Office.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Yeah … funny really, ’cos I’d never thought
of it but being middle-aged and old takes up most of your time, doesn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: You’re only right.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: I’m not wrong.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Where are you off to?</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: I’m going parading before it’s too late!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Eh, Ringo, do you know what happened to
me?</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: No. I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: You want to stop being so scornful, it’s
twisting your face.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Here he is, the middle-aged boy wonder.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Eh. I thought you were looking after the old
man.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Get knotted!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: We’ve got only half an hour till the final
run-through. He can’t walk out on us.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Can’t he? He’s done it, son!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Eh, I don’t know if you realise it, but
…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: We do.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yes. Your grandfather’s stirred him up.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: He hasn’t.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yes, he’s filled his head with notions
seemingly.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: The old mixer, come on we’ll have to put him
right.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: We’ll split up and search for him, he can’t be
far.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It’s happened at last, we’ve become a limited
company.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’ll look in here again.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Get out of it, short house!</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Ain’t you got no more bleeding sense than
to go round chucking bricks about.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Southerner!</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Here, mate, that’s my hoop, stop playing with
it.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Hoop, this isn’t a hoop, it’s a lethal
weapon. Have you got a licence for it?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Oh don’t be so stroppy!</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Well! A boy of your age bowling <U>“hoop”</U>
at people. How old are you anyway?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Nine.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Bet you’re only eight and a half.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Eight and two thirds.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Well, there you are and watch it with that
hoop.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Gerron out of it, you’re only jealous ’cause
you’re old.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Shurrup!</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: I bet you’re – sixteen!</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Fifteen and two thirds, actually.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Well –</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: All right, take your hoop and bowl.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Oh you can have it, I’m packing it in – it
depresses me.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Y’what?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: You heard, it gets on my wick.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Well that’s lovely talk, that is. And another
thing, why aren’t you at school?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: I’m a deserter.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Are you now?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Yeah, I’ve blown school out.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Just you?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: No, Ginger, Eddy Fallon and Ding Dong.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Ding Dong? Oh Ding Dong Bell, eh?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Yeah, that’s right, they was supposed to come
with us but they chickened.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Yeah? And they’re your mates are they?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Not much cop without ’em, is it?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Oh, it’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: What they like?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Ginger’s mad, he says things all the time and
Eddy’s good at punching and spitting.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: How about Ding Dong?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: He’s a big head and he fancies himself with it
but you know it’s all right ’cos he’s one of the gang.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Why aren’t you at work?</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: I’m a deserter, too.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: See you.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Oh, there you are!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh, I’m sorry, I must have made a
mistake.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: You haven’t, you’re just late. Oh, yes,
he’s going to be very pleased with you.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Is he?</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Yes, you’re quite a feather in the cap.
Hello, I’ve got one … oh, I think so … yes, he can talk … Well … I think
you ought to see him. Of course, right away.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Well … come on.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Will this do, Simon?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Not bad, dolly, not really bad. Turn around,
chicky baby.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Oh yes, a definite poss. He’ll look good
alongside Susan. All right, Sunny Jim, this is all going to be quite
painless. Don’t breathe on me, Adrian.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Look, I’m terribly sorry but I’m afraid
there’s been some sort of a misunderstanding.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Oh, you can come off it with us. You don’t
have to do the old adenoidal glottal stop and carry on for our
benefit.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’m afraid I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Oh, my God, he’s a natural.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: They ought to know by now the phonies are
much easier to handle. Still he’s a good type.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: We want you to give us your opinion on some
clothes for teenagers.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh, by all means, I’d be quite prepared for
that eventuality.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Well, not your real opinion, naturally. It’ll
be written out and you’ll learn it. Can he read?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Of course I can.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I mean lines, ducky, can you handle
lines?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’ll have a bash.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Good. Hart, get him whatever it is they
drink, a cokearama?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Ta.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Well, at least he’s polite. Tony Show him the
shirts, Adrian.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Now, you’ll like these. You really “dig”
them. They’re “fab” and all the other pimply hyperboles.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I wouldn’t be seen dead in them. They’re
dead grotty.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Grotty?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah, grotesque.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Make a note of that word and give it to
Susan. I think it’s rather touching really. Here’s this kid trying to
give me his utterly valueless opinion when I know for a fact within four
weeks he’ll be suffering from a violent inferiority complex and loss of
status if he isn’t wearing one of these nasty things. Of course they’re
grotty, you wretched nit, that’s why they were designed, but that’s what
you’ll want.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: But I won’t.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: You can be replaced you know, chicky
baby.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I don’t care.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: And that pose is out too, Sunny Jim. The new
thing is to care passionately, and be right wing. Anyway, you won’t meet
Susan if you don’t cooperate.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: And who’s this Susan when she’s at home?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Only Susan Campey, our resident teenager.
You’ll have to love her. She’s your symbol.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh, you mean that posh bird who gets
everything wrong?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I beg your pardon?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh, yes, the lads frequently gather round
the T.V. set to watch her for a giggle. Once we even all sat down and
wrote these letters saying how gear she was and all that rubbish.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: She’s a trend setter. It’s her
profession!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: She’s a drag. A well-known drag. We turn the
sound down on her and say rude things.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Get him out of here!!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Have I said something amiss?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Get him out of here. He’s knocking the
programme’s image!!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Sorry about the shirts.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Get him out. You don’t think he’s a new
phenomenon, do you?</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: You mean an early clue to the new
direction?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Where’s the calendar? No, he’s just a trouble
maker. The change isn’t due for three weeks. All the same, make a note
not to extend Susan’s contract. Let’s not take any unnecessary
chances!</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: I’m sorry lads, I didn’t mean it,
honest.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: If he says that again, I’ll strike
him.</p>
<p><strong>shake</strong>: They’ll be back, they’re good lads, they’ll
be back.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Yes? Well they’ve got only ten minutes to
the final run-through.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: I meant no harm. I was only trying to
encourage little Ringo to enjoy himself.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: God knows what you’ve unleashed on the
unsuspecting South. It’ll be wine, women and song all the way with Ringo
once he’s got the taste for it.</p>
<p><strong>barmaid</strong>: That was fresh this morning.</p>
<p><strong>barmaid</strong>: That’ll be two and nine…</p>
<p><strong>barmaid</strong>: Right … On your way!</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Y’what?</p>
<p><strong>barmaid</strong>: You heard, on your way, troublemaker!</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: If I believed you, sir, I might do those
things and walk those ways only to find myself on Problem’s Path. But I
cannot believe you, and all those urgings serve only as a proof that you
will lie and lie again to gain your purpose with me.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Well … go ’head, do the next bit.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Go away! You’ve spoilt it.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Oh, sorry I spoke.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Are you supposed to be here?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’ve got you worried, haven’t I?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I’m warning you, they’ll be back in a
minute.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: D’you know something, “They” don’t worry me at
all. Anyroad, I only fancy listening to you … that’s all but if it
worries you … well …</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: You’re from Liverpool, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: How’d you guess?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Oh, it’s the way you talk.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Is it … is it, really?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Are you pulling my leg?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Something like that.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I see. Do you like the play?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yeah … I mean, sure, well, I took it at school
but I only ever heard boys and masters saying those lines, like, sounds
different on a girl. Yeah, it’s gear on a girl.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Gear?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Aye, the big hammer, smashing!</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Don’t mench … well, why don’t you give us a
few more lines, like?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You don’t half slam the door in people’s
faces, do you? I mean, what about when you’re playing the part, like,
hundreds of people’ll see you and …</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I’m not …</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Oh, you’re the understudy, sort of thing?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: No. I’m a walk-on in a fancy dress scene. I
just felt like doing those lines.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Oh, I see. You are an actress though, aren’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Aye, I knew you were.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: What’s that mean?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Well, the way you were spouting, like …. “I
don’t believe you, sir…” and all that. Yeah, it was gear.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: The big hammer?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Oh aye, a sledge.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: But the way you did it then sounded so
phony.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No … I wouldn’t say that … just like an
actress … you know.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: But that’s not like a real person at all.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Aye well, actresses aren’t like real people,
are they?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: They ought to be.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Oh, I don’t know, anyroad up, they never are,
are they?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: What are you?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m in a group … well … there are four of us,
we play and sing.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I bet you don’t sound like real people.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: We do, you know. We sound like us having a
ball. It’s fab.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Is it really fab or are you just saying that
to convince yourself?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What of? Look, I wouldn’t do it unless I was.
I’m dead lucky ’cos I get paid for doing something I love doing.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: … all this and a jam butty too!!</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I only enjoy acting for myself. I hate it when
other people are let in.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Why? I mean, which are you, scared or
selfish?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Why selfish?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Well, you’ve got to have people to taste your
treacle toffee.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No, hang on, I’ve not gone daft. You see, when
I was little me mother let me make some treacle toffee one time in our
back scullery. When I’d done she said to me, “Go and give some to the
other kids.” So, I said I would but I thought to meself, “She must think
I’m soft.” Anyroad, I was eating away there but I wanted somebody else
to know how good it was so in the end I wound up giving it all away …
but I didn’t mind, mind, ’cos I’d made the stuff in the first place.
Well … that’s why you need other people… an audience … to taste your
treacle toffee, like. Eh … does that sound as thickheaded to you as it
does to me?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Not really but I’m probably not a toffee
maker. How would you do those lines of mine?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Well, look at it this way, I mean, when you
come right down to it, that girl, she’s a bit of a scrubber, isn’t
she?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Is she?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Of course … Look, if she was a Liverpool
scrubber … Eh, fella, you want to try pulling the other one, it’s got a
full set of bells hanging off it … Y’what? … I know your sort, two cokes
and a packet of cheese and onion crisps and suddenly it’s love and we’re
stopping in an empty shop doorway. You’re just after me body and y’can’t
have it … so there!!</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: And you honestly think that’s what she
meant?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Oh, definitely, it sticks out a mile, she’s
trying to get him to marry her but he doesn’t want … well … I don’t
reckon any fella’s ever wanted to get married. But girls are like that,
clever and cunning. You’ve got to laugh.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Well, it’s nice to know you think we’re
clever.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: And cunning.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: And what do you do about it?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Me? Oh, I don’t have the time, I’m always
running about with the lads … no, we don’t have the time.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Pity.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Aye, it is but as long as you get by, it’s all
right, you know … bash on, happy valley’s when they let you stop.
Anyroad, I’d better get back.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: See you.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Worry, will you!</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Well, that’s it, two minutes to the final
run-through… they’re bound to miss it…</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: I’ll murder that Lennon.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: But I suppose we can survive a missed
run-through as long…</p>
<p><strong>shake</strong>: … as they head up for the show. Oh yes, well
I mean it’ud be a pity to miss the show, wouldn’t it like.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Shurrup, cheerful.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: You don’t think…</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: They’ll be here.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Oh now, they can’t do that to me. It’s all
your fault. Oh yes it is and if they don’t turn up I wouldn’t be in your
shoes for all the…</p>
<p><strong>shake</strong>: … tea in China. Oh you’re right, neither
would I.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Traitor!</p>
<p><strong>shake</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hi Norm!</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Hi, our lot!</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Our lot!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Did you want something.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: I could eat the lot of you.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You’d look gear with an apple in your gob.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Do you realise you could have missed the
final run-through?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>shake</strong>: Eh, there’s only three of them.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Aye, we were looking for Ringo. But we
realised he must have come back.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Do you realise we are on the air, live, in
front of an audience, in forty-five minutes and you’re one short.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Control yourself or you’ll spurt. He’s bound
to be somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Aye, let’s try the dressing room.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Eh, where’s my grandfather?</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Don’t worry about him. He can look after
himself.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Aye, I suppose so.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Here they are, personally signed and
handwritten by your own sweet boys. The chance of a lifetime. Be the
envy of your less fortunate sisters!</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Look, I’m Ringo Starr… I’ve got a show to do
in a few minutes you’ve got to let me go… I’m Ringo…</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Sure, they all say that these days …
Anyway … I don’t care who you are… you can save that for the stipendary.
Here you are, Sarge.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: What is he?</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: I’ve got a little list here. Wandering
abroad. Malicious intent. Acting in a suspicious manner. Conduct liable
to cause a breach of the peace. You name it, he’s done it.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Oh, a little savage, is he?</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: A proper Aborigine.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: I demand to see me solicitor.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: What’s his name?</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Oh, well if you’re going to get technical
–</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Hello, it’s going to be one of those
nights, is it? Sit Charley Peace down over there.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Well, you got me here so do your worst
but I’ll take one of you with me. Oh, I know your game, get me in the
tiled room and out come the rubber hoses but I’ll defy you still.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Is there a fire, then?</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: You ugly, great brute you, you have
sadism stamped all over your bloated British kisser.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Eh?</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: I’ll go on a hunger strike. I know your
caper. The kidney punch and the rabbit-clout. The third degree and the
size twelve boot ankle-tap.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: What’s he on about?</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: I’m soldier of the Republic, you’ll
need the mahogany truncheon for this boyo. A nation once again.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Get Lloyd George over there with that
mechanic in the cloth cap while I sort this lot out.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Ringo, me old scout, they grabbed yer
leg for the iron too, did they?</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Well I’m not exactly a voluntary patient.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Shush! Have they roughed you up
yet?</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Keep your voice down, this lot’ll paste
you, just for the exercise. Oh they’re a desperate crew of drippings and
they’ve fists like matured hams for pounding defenceless lads like
you.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Have they?</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: That sergeant’s a body-blow veteran if
ever I measured one. One of us has got to escape. I’ll get the boys.
Hold on son, I’ll be back for you.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Me!</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: And if they get you on the floor watch
out for your brisket.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Oh, they seem all right to me.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: That’s what they want you to think. All
coppers are villains.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Would you two like a cup of tea?</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: You see, sly villains.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: No thanks, Mr. Sergeant, sir.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: So you just brought the old chap out of
the crowd for his own good.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Yeah, but he insisted on us bringing him
to the station.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Well, he can’t stop here.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Lip reading.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: What are they saying?</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Nothing good.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Well son, it’s now or never.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: All right, you paid assassins. Johnny
McCartney’ll give you a run for your threepence ha’penny.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Now, what’s he up to?</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: He’s allergic to Bobbies, especially English
Bobbies.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Your man disappeared like a leveret over
a hill.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Turncoat!</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Mother!</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Be God, they’ve called up
reinforcements, the dragnet’s out!</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Only half an hour and you’re on!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Can I say something?</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Yes, anything.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: It’s highly unlikely we’ll be on… I mean the
law of averages are against you and it seems that, etc., etc….</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: I’ll have the hides off of you lot.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: You ought to be ashamed of yourself. Go
home!</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: I must see Pauly.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Go home then and see him on the telly.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Can you fix him for me?</p>
<p><strong>boys</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Sixpence.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Each?</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Oh, all right.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: And in advance.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Mercenary!</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: It’s all right, leave him alone.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Grandad, where’s Ringo?</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: The police have the poor unfortunate
lad in the Bridewell.</p>
<p><strong>boys</strong>: The police station.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: He’ll be pulp by now.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What are we waiting for?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Come here.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: We’ve only got twenty minutes.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: What is all this?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hold on until we get our breath.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: All right now?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Sure. Ready?</p>
<p><strong>87. <u>exterior street</u></strong>: THE CHASE CARRIES
ON.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Ah well, it was worth a try.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: What do you think you’re up to?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Arrest those boys, sir.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: That’s all we need to start a real riot!
Come on lads, they’re waiting for you.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Boys, you don’t know what this means to
me. If you hadn’t come back it would have been the epilogue or the news
in Welsh for life.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Aren’t you supposed to be in that box?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: And another thing, where’s that old mixer?</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Here, Pauly.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Well, I got a few things to say to you,
two-faced John McCartney.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Aw, leave him alone Paul, he’s back, isn’t he?
And it’s not his fault he’s old.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What’s old got to do with it?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You needn’t bother.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Y’what?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Practising to be thick-headed, you’re there
already.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Look he’s a mixer and a trouble maker!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That’s right, but he’s only asking us to pay
attention to him, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You see. You know your trouble – you should
have gone West to America. You’d have wound up a Senior Citizen of
Boston. As it is you took the wrong turning and what happened, you’re a
lonely old man from Liverpool.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: But I’m clean.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: I’ve got the stuff. Come here.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Aren’t we …</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: No, we’re not!</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: The office was on the phone, they think it’d
be better if we pushed straight to Wolverhampton.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Tonight? We can’t make it …</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: You’ve got a midnight matinee.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Now, look here, Norm …</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: No, you look here, John. I’ve only one thing
to say to you.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: You’re a swine. So hurry up … we’re
travelling!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Where’s my grandfather?</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Don’t start. Look.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Come on, you’re hanging up the
parade.</p>
