<p><strong>t h e m a t r i x r e l o a d e d</strong>: Written by</p>
<p><strong>fade in on:</strong>: Dark clouds below the inky remnants of
the scorched sky. We hear wind as we sail, like a glider, over the black
atmosphere.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: “Six o’clock, 300 meters. We can’t outrun
’em.”</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: “I know. Can’t tow this crate fast enough! We
gotta ditch it!”</p>
<p><strong>niobe</strong>: “Can’t, the core is still good. And they’ve
got ‘The One.’”</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: “Oooh, our savior. He�d better be worth
it.”</p>
<p><strong>niobe</strong>: “Shut up and make the exit. Hold on!”</p>
<p><strong>niobe</strong>: “Woo-hoooh!”</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: “They’re still on us!”</p>
<p><strong>int. nebachanezzer cockpit</strong>: The NEB is slung between
the two HOVERCRAFT, with the cockpit facing backwards. TRINITY,
MORPHEUS, TANK, and NEO, the former Thomas Anderson, crowd the cockpit.
Helpless, the landscape speeds away from them, while a wall of red-eyed
SQUIDDIES speeds to them.</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “Niobe, they�re closing.”</p>
<p><strong>niobe</strong>: “How many?”</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “Just a few. Maybe two or three.
Hundred.”</p>
<p><strong>int. sephora cockpit</strong>: NIOBE, as regal as she is
beautiful, sits at the controls of her ship with her co-pilot, a younger
female. All visible dials are redlined as they streak over the dark
surface.</p>
<p><strong>niobe</strong>: “You�ve got a gift for understatement.”</p>
<p><strong>int. freedom cockpit</strong>: THE FREEDOM�S CAPTAIN, a
silhouette in a dark cockpit, is flying blind. His cockpit is awash in
the blue flares from NIOBE�S ship.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: “Oh shit, we�re screwed. We gotta set down and
EMP �em.”</p>
<p><strong>niobe</strong>: “Too many!”</p>
<p><strong>ext. freedom hull</strong>: A racing SQUIDDIES reaches the
hull and latches on, striking up its cutting laser and ripping into the
hull.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: “They�re on me! Shit! Losing power!”</p>
<p><strong>circa</strong>: “Multiple bogies closing!”</p>
<p><strong>niobe</strong>: “No shit.”</p>
<p><strong>circa</strong>: “From the front!”</p>
<p><strong>circa</strong>: “Are they -”</p>
<p><strong>int. neb cockpit</strong>: A massive swarm off missiles
blasts by the cockpit. The individual warheads swerve at the last
second, blowing SQUIDDIES apart, or casting them to the ground
aflame.</p>
<p><strong>int. sephora cockpit</strong>: Niobe breathes a sigh of
relief. Her lieutenant looks back up to see a wing of HOVER FIGHTERS -
‘DEFENDERS’ fly past their ship. Sleek, with huge blue flares from their
engines, they’re gunship fighters armed to the teeth with missiles and
laser turrets studding the fuselage.</p>
<p><strong>niobe</strong>: “They’re ours.”</p>
<p><strong>defender one</strong>: “Hold on, folks, you’re in for a
little cleaning.”</p>
<p><strong>ext. the surface</strong>: The wing of DEFENDERS makes short
work of the squiddies. The half dozen clinging to FREEDOM’S hull are
picked off by well-placed laser shots that turn the squiddies into
curdling balls of slag. The squiddies that survive turn tail and
run.</p>
<p><strong>int. neb cockpit</strong>: The crew of the Neb breathe a
collective sigh of relief as they leave the scene of aerial carnage
behind them.</p>
<p><strong>tank</strong>: “We’re home.”</p>
<p><strong>trinity</strong>: “Well, not yet, but we’re in the defense
screen.”</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “What’s that?”</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “A concentric ring of defenses that
shields Zion. The fighters that</p>
<p><strong>niobe</strong>: “Neb crew, you can relax now.”</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “For the moment, perhaps. Its still a long
drive home.”</p>
<p><strong>fade out</strong>: and</p>
<p><strong>fade into:</strong>: TRINITY’S CABIN. At first we see only
stars twinkling, faraway diamonds on a black velvet background. The
camera descends through the darkness, to a sunset, dark blue, as if just
after sunset. The artwork terminates in the metal ring going around her
room. It’s a much more hospitable place than the rest of the dreary
hovercraft. The articles she’s collected during her time in the
resistance dot the cabin. An unfinished sweatshirt sits on a loom. There
are charcoal portraits of loved ones.</p>
<p><strong>trinity</strong>: “I’ll have to take that one down now.
Cypher…”</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “Who is this guy?”</p>
<p><strong>trinity</strong>: “Who?”</p>
<p><strong>trinity</strong>: “That was… I… forgot his name.”</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “What happened to him?”</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “Was he like me?”</p>
<p><strong>trinity</strong>: “Not you, though. Like you. There have been
others, Neo.”</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “No. I’ve never been a big sleeper.”</p>
<p><strong>trinity</strong>: “I know. I used to watch you hacking
without sleeping for days.”</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “How many ‘ones’ have there been?”</p>
<p><strong>trinity</strong>: “That’s not the point.”</p>
<p><strong>trinity</strong>: “You are him. You�re mine.”</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “But what does it mean, to be The One?”</p>
<p><strong>trinity</strong>: “I don’t know, Neo. Our mission was to find
you.”</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “So, now what?”</p>
<p><strong>trinity</strong>: “Now, Zion will give us a new mission.”</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “We’re almost home. We’ll need a detail.
Five minutes.”</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “Does he ever knock?”</p>
<p><strong>trinity</strong>: “Not on his ship.”</p>
<p><strong>int. main deck, neb</strong>: The crew grips the bulkhead and
fixtures as the swaying ship comes to a rest. Outside, the sounds of
hover engines fade away. Tank unlocks the main hatch, then jumps as it
drops, unpowered, slamming into the tarmac with a resounding smash.</p>
<p><strong>ext. zion tarmac</strong>: The tarmac is a busy, crowded
military airport, with hovercraft of different sizes spread across the
lot. Its housed poorly lit, houses in a cave so huge the ceiling is out
of site. Crewpersons run around, servicing battle-damaged vehicles.
Munitions are carted across the tarmac on robot rolling racks. No one
pays the NEB and its battered crew any mind.</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “Niobe…”</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “Thanks for the rescue.”</p>
<p><strong>choi</strong>: “Brough, you us your asses! We saved you so
hard core you don’t even</p>
<p><strong>choi</strong>: “So, you think you finally found The One, huh?
Another One?”</p>
<p><strong>dujour</strong>: “Idiot, we helped him find him. Hello,
Morpheus.”</p>
<p><strong>choi</strong>: “Huh?”</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “You?”</p>
<p><strong>choi</strong>: “In the flesh, so to speak.”</p>
<p><strong>dujour</strong>: “Welcome to the real world, Neo. I’m glad
you’re here.”</p>
<p><strong>choi</strong>: “What do you think, Dujour? Should we take him
with us?”</p>
<p><strong>dujour</strong>: “Definitely.”</p>
<p><strong>choi</strong>: “Morpheus?”</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “Go on ship’s liberty. Meet me in the Dead
Duck at 21:00 hours, drunk</p>
<p><strong>ext. zion street</strong>: It’s like a valley floor running
between two gigantic walls of rock that are nearly vertical, coming
together in an elongated archway. Carved into the street level are
innumerable stores and shops, above them, apartments and balconies that
rise to the top of the arch. People flow through the street. Their
clothes are homespun wool, denim, and leather. Dyes and color are
absent. Carved into the solid granite walls, between homes and around
windows and doors, are intricate and beautiful carvings.</p>
<p><strong>choi</strong>: “See, man? This is home. This is the main
street. One of �em, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>choi</strong>: “Our energy as a people is directed toward
liberation. Check it out,</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “Where did they come from?”</p>
<p><strong>choi</strong>: “Energy plant we raided on our last mission.
There were some</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “How are their minds freed from the
Matrix?”</p>
<p><strong>trinity</strong>: “With difficulty.”</p>
<p><strong>dujour</strong>: “If at all.”</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: “Welcome home, brothers and sisters. First
day back?”</p>
<p><strong>choi</strong>: “Yes, lovely.”</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: “On the house, then. Four rums?”</p>
<p><strong>trinity</strong>: “Make it eight.”</p>
<p><strong>trinity</strong>: “Any casualties?”</p>
<p><strong>choi</strong>: “Two. Sidewinder and Left-right.”</p>
<p><strong>dujour</strong>: “I can�t believe Cypher turned.
Bastard.”</p>
<p><strong>choi</strong>: “He who loses faith…”</p>
<p><strong>dujour</strong>: “Neo, we monitored your fight. Did you
really gain enlightenment?”</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “All I know is I kicked Smith�s ass.”</p>
<p><strong>choi</strong>: “Fuckin� finally, Jesus Christ. It�s about
time we iced that bastard.”</p>
<p><strong>dujour</strong>: “Yeah, we finally won against an agent?”</p>
<p><strong>choi</strong>: “I guess 1 �n 298 isn�t a bed record,
huh?”</p>
<p><strong>choi</strong>: “Live free or die.”</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “God, how do you do that?”</p>
<p><strong>trinity</strong>: “You�ve never drank before.”</p>
<p><strong>dujour</strong>: “Not for real.”</p>
<p><strong>choi</strong>: “You want to know what being The One
means?”</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “What?”</p>
<p><strong>choi</strong>: “One drink and you�re toast.”</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “Yeah.”</p>
<p><strong>dujour</strong>: “Yeah, you�ve never done it.”</p>
<p><strong>choi</strong>: “And virtual doesn�t count, man, doesn�t
fucking count.”</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “Well. I�ll drink to that.”</p>
<p><strong>choi</strong>: “Here, here.”</p>
<p><strong>ext. main street, zion</strong>: The lights are dim, and only
a few late night revelers stagger through the streets on their way back
home. Walking straight and calmly through the stragglers are MORPHEUS
and NIOBE.</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “So, how do you like having your own
command?”</p>
<p><strong>niobe</strong>: “It�s good. But trying. The
responsibility…”</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “You must be both mother and father to
your crew.”</p>
<p><strong>niobe</strong>: “Who will you be now? The mother, or the
father?”</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “As long as they don�t get out of line,
I�ll just be a brother.”</p>
<p><strong>int. dead duck</strong>: NEO is out of it, while the others
are merely comfortably in the bag. He�s acting like a kid who broke into
his father�s liquor cabinet.</p>
<p><strong>choi</strong>: “So, you went back in, and you two pulled him
out?”</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “Kicked… kicked Smith�s ass.”</p>
<p><strong>choi</strong>: “Hey, did you kick anybody else�s ass, Neo?
Like Morpheus?”</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “Morpheus? Yeah, I smacked him around,
too.”</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “So, you can smack me around, Neo?”</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “Oh yeah. Anytime.”</p>
<p><strong>trinity</strong>: “How�s Tank?”</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “He�s on bereavement leave with his
mother. Dozer was the second son</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “The Nebechanezzer is out of commission
for at least a month. But,</p>
<p><strong>trinity</strong>: “Let me guess. We�ve been ordered back out
anyway.”</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “Yes. This is another special op. I�m in
command, Niobe and Trinity</p>
<p><strong>flash to</strong>: NEO, passed out with his mouth open on the
couch.</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “We don�t know exactly what he�s capable
of. He may be just tapping his potential, or he may have already reached
it. We are to learn from</p>
<p><strong>choi</strong>: “Why are we always getting screwed? Not only
do I have to go straight</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “You�ve been assigned to this mission
because you�re the best, Choi.”</p>
<p><strong>dujour</strong>: “Yeah, and headquarters thinks you might be
able to whine the agents</p>
<p><strong>choi</strong>: “Oh my God that�s so funny. My point is, don�t
we need some r-and-r? Unwind a little? We lost two crew on the last one,
you lost like five,</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “You don�t have to go, Choi. Volunteers
only.”</p>
<p><strong>trinity</strong>: “He�s got a point, M. I have faith, but why
so quick?”</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “We have a chance, here, but the window of
opportunity is brief. Our ships say the Matrix is already upgrading and
re-coding to block our</p>
<p><strong>choi</strong>: “Fuck. Every fucking time we get another
�one,� this is what they do.”</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “He is the One.”</p>
<p><strong>dujour</strong>: “You haven�t lost the faith, have you
Choi?”</p>
<p><strong>choi</strong>: “Well, these are the times that try men�s
souls. Here�s to victory.”</p>
<p><strong>ext. tunnel</strong>: The FREEDOM hovers slowly, silently,
like a submarine as it cruises through the murky depths. It suddenly
comes to a quiet stop, and descends. The engines fade out, and the
vessel rests, darkened, on the cave.</p>
<p><strong>int. freedom cockpit</strong>: They watch the SQUIDDIES fade
into the distance.</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “Power up. Sleep mode.”</p>
<p><strong>choi</strong>: “Aye aye, capitano.”</p>
<p><strong>int. main deck</strong>: The ship�s OPERATOR, a lean Asian
kid with a gaze like a laser scan, sits behind NEO, who�s sitting at the
operator�s console with his hands on the abbreviated keyboard. Trinity
sits with them, her feet up as she observes.</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “Ka equals 9. But reverse Ka is point-nine,
right?</p>
<p><strong>razor</strong>: “You catch on quick, man.”</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “I know these symbols from the hacking trainer.
But how come it�s so</p>
<p><strong>trinity</strong>: “Your brain knows what to do. But it has to
associate characters with</p>

bar and your thumbs nail it. Because your thumbs have hit the space bar
millions of times. But think about reverse �ka,� and your fingers don�t
hit automatically hit</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “Where did these symbols come from,
anyway?”</p>
<p><strong>razor</strong>: “Most of it is from the old Japanese. It�s
Katakana. See, the machines aren�t binary. No zero and one. They�re
quantum-based, so instead of</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “All numbers between zero and one. That could
be an infinite number of</p>
<p><strong>razor</strong>: “Not could be, it is.”</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “Holy shit. How many calculations per
second?”</p>
<p><strong>razor</strong>: “How many CPS? Well, that�s kind of hard to
estimate. Put it this way: picture all the particles in the known
universe. Not just atoms, but</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “OK. At last count that was what, a gazillion,
right? Two gazillion?”</p>
<p><strong>razor</strong>: “Well, it�s up there. In any case, the number
of calculations per</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “Woah.”</p>
<p><strong>trinity</strong>: “That�s how they have the operating power
to create entire worlds</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “OK. That�s why it looks like reality. They
have the computing power</p>
<p><strong>razor</strong>: “Right.”</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “So, if we hack into the Matrix, why can�t we
just change the code</p>
<p><strong>razor</strong>: “No, no. See, it�s not that simple. The
machines, the programs that code, create, and maintain the Matrix, the
agents, they are code. interaction in the matrix. Then, there are the
enforcers, the ones we</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “Right.”</p>
<p><strong>razor</strong>: “Well, my point is, the machines code and
recode the Matrix by pure will. Interaction with the Matrix, the
physical act of being there, by default, allows people to change their
environment - the Matrix.</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “Like reality.”</p>
<p><strong>trinity</strong>: “Almost. Reality is unalterable. But the
fabric of reality in the Matrix can be rewoven. Some can reach beyond
normal cause. Their</p>

freak. A good freak. You�re</p>

through cloning, since, in the Matrix are exactly the same as when the
first clones. They</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “OK, so how do you explain me?”</p>
<p><strong>trinity</strong>: “Not just you. Morpheus, myself. We were
all born inside.</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “Well, what separates us from others?”</p>
<p><strong>trinity</strong>: “For the past 50 years or so, something has
been happening to children in the Matrix. They�ve been mutating,
changing in ways the machines</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “And others are able to change the reality
of the Matrix itself.”</p>

programming, man. He�s stuck in</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “In the Matrix, without him, we�re
helpless.”</p>

is now?”</p>

slow going out there. I</p>
<p><strong>ext. mountain top, late day</strong>: TRINITY sits alone on
the tip of an impossibly high finger of rock. It looks like it sits on
the rooftop of the world. All around her, as far as the eye can see, lie
mountains. Their snow-capped peaks are pink in the sunset light.</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “Boo.”</p>
<p><strong>trinity</strong>: “Don�t lose your balance.”</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “It doesn�t matter if I do.”</p>
<p><strong>trinity</strong>: “So, you can fly.”</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “Yes.”</p>
<p><strong>trinity</strong>: “Do you think I can?”</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “I think you can do anything you want, if you
believe.”</p>
<p><strong>trinity</strong>: “Like you?”</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “I don�t know. I don�t know exactly what I can
do.”</p>
<p><strong>trinity</strong>: “Will you teach me to fly?”</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “I don�t know if I can.”</p>
<p><strong>trinity</strong>: “Free your mind of doubt.”</p>
<p><strong>trinity</strong>: “In this construct program, the ground can
kill.”</p>

there. Step out. I can do</p>

<p><strong>trinity</strong>: “Showing you, Neo.”</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “Showing me what? You nearly gave me a heart
attack.”</p>
<p><strong>trinity</strong>: “I want you to know how much faith I have
in you.”</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “Oh. And this requires acts of insanity?”</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “Only when I�m plugged in.”</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “What?”</p>

<p><strong>trinity</strong>: “They�re watching us, you big dope. Do you
know how horny computer</p>
<p><strong>int. main bridge</strong>: CHOI, RAZOR, DUJOUR, and CIRCA are
sitting around the operator�s console, feet up, eating. On the screens
are patchy images of TRINITY and NEO standing together in the GLADE.
It�s like they�re watching a soap opera.</p>
<p><strong>ext. glade</strong>: TRINITY grabs NEO by the arm.</p>
<p><strong>trinity</strong>: “Over here.”</p>
<p><strong>int. main bridge</strong>: THE VOYEURISTIC crewmembers
collectively groan as the lovers disappear off the screen and into the
darkness.</p>
<p><strong>razor</strong>: “So romantic.”</p>
<p><strong>circa</strong>: “I�m sure Mary Palmer will appreciate your
mood more than I.”</p>
<p><strong>ext. glade</strong>: IN the blue twilight shade, NEO and
TRINITY kiss tentatively, slowly, then quicker as they give in to their
feelings for one another. WE move around them slowly, then pan into the
shadows, a natural fadeout.</p>
<p><strong>int. office</strong>: AGENTS JONES and BROWN sit across from
each other, a steel table between them. They stare at each other for
what seems like a long time. There is a speaker phone in the middle of
the table amidst neat stacks of file folders.</p>
<p><strong>agent jones</strong>: “Our defeat is worrisome.”</p>
<p><strong>agent brown</strong>: “As is the loss of our colleague.”</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: “We can�t defeat them. You saw what
happened.”</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: “We have a backup copy of Agent Smith…”</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: “A backup is not good enough. We need to
upgrade ourselves to meet the</p>

<p><strong>jones</strong>: “The terrorists have learned to bend our
reality in ways we cannot.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: “Mr. Thomas J. Anderson is not unique. Over
the decades, many humans have developed… techniques for manipulating the
Matrix. Techniques potential, but all the ones we�ve noticed exhibiting
these talents are</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: “Do you have anyone in mind?”</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: “Gregory Lowfield. He exhibits the traits we
saw in Mr. Anderson.”</p>
<p><strong>man�s voice</strong>: “Mr. Anderson no longer exists. Our
enemy now is the one called…</p>
<p><strong>angle on: the door</strong>: AGENT SMITH walks in, grinning.
There is a new swag to his walk, and his hair is longer, tied back.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: “You�ve been recreated.”</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: “And you have more hair.”</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: “I know what you�re thinking. What we need is
our own Neo…”</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: “If it�s possible.”</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: “I�ll make it possible.”</p>
<p><strong>ext. desert highway</strong>: FAR OFF in the distance, the
glow of motorcycle headlights racing toward us. As we zoom out and focus
in, they are already too close to avoid. They rip by us, thundering
explosions and men and women cheering.</p>
<p><strong>chandra</strong>: “Greg, are you fucking crazy?”</p>
<p><strong>greg</strong>: “Yes. But don�t worry.”</p>
<p><strong>int. cruiser</strong>: The cop sets his paper down just long
enough to catch a glimpse of the pack exploding down the highway, with
GREGORY surfing his bike.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: the radar gun. It�s flashing 125 MPH</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: “Holy shit. Drunk ass punks.”</p>
<p><strong>ext. highway</strong>: GREGORY is facing us as he drops back
into his seat, taking his beer on cue from CHANDRA. Behind them, the
cop�s lights flare up.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: “Oh boy. Stop, stop, let�s have some
fun.”</p>
<p><strong>int. cop car</strong>: WE look through the windshield as the
cop drives down the highway, calling in his stop-vehicle report. He
suddenly sees something that makes him slam on the brakes.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: “Holy shit!”</p>
<p><strong>ext. road</strong>: THE cruiser comes to a stop mere inches
from GREGORY�S leg. The COP bursts out of the door.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: “What the hell are you doing?”</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: “We�ll tell you when to stop, little man.
Not the other way around.”</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: “Fuck.”</p>
<p><strong>int. cruiser</strong>: The COP is lying half-on the seat,
taking cover. The handset relays only static. He reaches for his gun,
but is frozen by Gregory�s voice.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: “Don�t try anything stupid, man. I gotta
bead on your donut-eating</p>
<p><strong>ext. cruiser</strong>: The cop comes out with his hands
up.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: “Whaddya want with me?”</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: “I don�t know. I just thought I�d find out
what you wanted without you</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: “You�re all under arrest.”</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: “This is your lucky day, officer. We�re
gonna give you a night off.”</p>
<p><strong>chandra</strong>: “Drink.”</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: “You never even saw us, man.”</p>
<p><strong>chandra</strong>: “Keep the bottle.”</p>
<p><strong>ext. beach</strong>: A CAMPFIRE blazes only a few feet away
from the high tide. A billion stars shine overhead as GREGORY and his
biker gang, including the cop, sit or lie around the fire. A few people
are still awake, and one picks drunkenly at a guitar.</p>
<p><strong>ext. dunes</strong>: GREGORY and CHANDRA lie on the blanket,
staring at the sky. Inexplicably, GREGROY holds a hand toward the
sky.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: “Which one do you want?”</p>
<p><strong>chandra</strong>: “Any one. It doesn�t matter.”</p>
<p><strong>chandra</strong>: “How do you do it, Gregory?”</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: “I don�t know. Sometimes it feels like… I�m
reaching beyond the</p>
<p><strong>chandra</strong>: “What is it?”</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: “They found us. Can�t you hear it?”</p>
<p><strong>chandra</strong>: “What? I don�t hear anything.”</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: “We can only rebel so long. We can only
push until they will hit</p>
<p><strong>chandra</strong>: “They? The Men in Black?”</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: “Fuck! Get to the bikes.”</p>
<p><strong>ext. campfire</strong>: GREGORY bursts over the hill, holding
hands with CHANDRA as they run. He�s only had time to through on his
boots and boxers and grab his .44. Chandra is dressed only in her
underwear and Gregory�s leather jacket.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: “Wake up! Get on your bikes and fucking
ride!”</p>
<p><strong>“this is the police, stop your vehicles and
surrender!”</strong>: SUDDENLY, automatic fire sparks from the unseen
helicopters. A bullet trail stitches its way across a pair of bikers,
sending them to the ground as the helicopters fly overhead.</p>
<p><strong>ext. highway</strong>: THE pack splits up in two directions
as the distant choppers circle back. GREGORY cuts the lights on his bike
and follows the highway by starlight.</p>
<p><strong>int. helicopter cockpit</strong>: TINNY RADIO chatter fills
the red-lit cockpit over the steady hum of the engines. The nose of the
chopper points to the ground as it focuses on GREGORY and CHANDRA, who
are ripping down the highway.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: “Holy shit, he�s outrunning us.”</p>
<p><strong>ext. highway</strong>: GREGORY is pasted down to the tank of
his bike with CHANDRA gripping him for her life. The slipstream pulls
his lips open and tears streak from his eyes as his bike redlines in
fifth gear. The helicopters grow smaller behind them. They break
chase.</p>
<p><strong>chandra</strong>: “They�re gone!”</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: “Can�t see shit.”</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: “Split up, into the desert, go!”</p>
<p><strong>int. cruiser</strong>: THE ENGINE smashes in through the
console, pushing the cops apart as the glass windshield explodes and
their seats slide forward into the console, smashing them like
jelly.</p>
<p><strong>cu: gregory and chandra</strong>: WITH HIS HAND still on the
grille, CHANDRA AND GREGORY remain untouched, even as the entire police
cruiser rips around them. WE drop back into REAL time and see the
cruiser�s body rip over and around them. The grille and engine block and
part of the mangled transmission remain still against GREGORY�S HAND.
The cruiser was gutted, like a banana shot down the center from top to
bottom. It speeds beyond them, silent now, flips and explodes.</p>
<p><strong>cu: gutted cruiser</strong>: UNBELIEVABLY, the driver is
still alive… barely. The steering wheel is smashed deep into his mouth,
splitting his jaw open. Wet, broken chokes emanate from his blood-filled
mouth. His eyes flicker, and just before they close forever, his body is
seized by pain as he MORPHS.</p>
<p><strong>ext. gutted cruiser</strong>: THE CRUMPLED DOOR is knocked
out of the frame. WE SEE a black loafer step from the vehicle and a man
in an immaculate black suit steps out slowly.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: “Sir, should we pursue?”</p>
<p><strong>agent brown</strong>: “Withdraw your men and pursue the
others. We have our own plans for</p>
<p><strong>int. main bridge</strong>: The ship is quiet. RAZOR sits at
the operator console, smashing the keyboard as he forces Tetris pieces
into place.</p>
<p><strong>int. cockpit</strong>: CHOI is sipping coffee as he nudges
the ship to a stop. He speaks into his headphones.</p>
<p><strong>choi</strong>: “OK, try it here.”</p>
<p><strong>int. main bridge</strong>: RAZOR halts his video game playing
and flashes to a different screen. Lines of code come pouring down the
screen as he types, then hits the ENTER key with a flourish. The screen
flashes, and the familiar scroll of the MATRIX cascades down the
screens.</p>
<p><strong>razor</strong>: “Holy shit.”</p>
<p><strong>choi</strong>: “What? Tell me you got signal.”</p>
<p><strong>razor</strong>: “No fucking shit I got signal. Dude, they�re
changing it.”</p>
<p><strong>choi</strong>: “Are you using the right pulse wave?”</p>
<p><strong>razor</strong>: “Shut the fuck up and get back here.”</p>
<p><strong>choi</strong>: “Oh my God. What are they -”</p>
<p><strong>razor</strong>: “They�re changing the Matrix.”</p>
<p><strong>choi</strong>: “Call Morpheus.”</p>
<p><strong>int. morpheus cabin</strong>: IT�S dark, but quiet classical
music can be heard. He�s not in bed alone. NIOBE�S shaded form can be
made out behind him.</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “I�m here.”</p>
<p><strong>razor</strong>: “Sir, you gotta get down here.”</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “Proximity alarm?”</p>
<p><strong>razor</strong>: “The Matrix, sir. The coding is going
nuts.”</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “Be right there.”</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “It sounds bad. They�re readjusting
quicker than we thought.”</p>
<p><strong>niobe</strong>: “Already?”</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “It appears that they are learning their
lessons.”</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “Tell Neo? About his predecessors, I
suppose?”</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “He is the -”</p>
<p><strong>niobe</strong>: “Six came before him, Morpheus.”</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “To me, none came before him. The Oracle
told me I would find the one.</p>
<p><strong>niobe</strong>: “What if they toughen the Matrix code, like
last time?”</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “There are lots of ifs. How about this
one: What if we lose faith in</p>
<p><strong>int. main bridge</strong>: MORPHEUS leans over RAZOR and
CHOI.</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “Talk to me.”</p>
<p><strong>razor</strong>: “Not good, boss, I gotta compile a new
descrambler.”</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “Do it. We�re at broadcast depth?”</p>
<p><strong>choi</strong>: “Yes sir.”</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “We have to download our mission specs.
Move aside, I have to log into</p>
<p><strong>target: matrix mainframe</strong>: MORPHEUS� eyes open
slightly when he reads the screen, but he regains his composure quickly.
RAZOR�S mouth drops open, and CHOI starts cracking up.</p>
<p><strong>choi</strong>: “The mainframe? Haha. It�s a joke, right
Morpheus? Is today April 1^st</p>
<p><strong>niobe</strong>: “It�s not a joke. We have The One. We must do
it now.”</p>
<p><strong>razor</strong>: “But they�re altering the code already. I
can�t even read it yet.”</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “We have our mission, but it�s up to us to
interperate how we�ll do</p>
<p><strong>razor</strong>: “Morpheus, there�s more ice in front of that
mainframe than there is</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “You haven�t seen The One in action.”</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “Can you hack in?”</p>
<p><strong>razor</strong>: “Getting you in is no problem. Maintaining
the input/output and</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “We don�t speak of the past.”</p>
<p><strong>cut to: neo</strong>: He�s standing at the edge of some
equipment on the Main Deck. He�s heard every word. He rounds the corner.
The others catch sight of him. The same thought is on everyone’s mind:
How much had he heard.</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “Morning. Niobe, wake the rest of the
crew. Razor, what�s the ETA for</p>
<p><strong>razor</strong>: “I dunno. Just gimme an hour, I�ll probably
have caught up to them.”</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “Come with me.”</p>
<p><strong>ext. desert</strong>: FROM FAR AWAY, we see GREGORY and
CHANDRA hiding under the only bit of shade available for miles, a tiny
outcropping of rock. We sail in and cut to a panning shot, scanning over
the harsh ground, onto CHANDRA�S feet, clad in Gregory�s boots, up her
sun-scorched and scratched legs. She�s collapsed onto Gregory. He�s in
equally bad shape. Gregory leans with his back against the rock, eyes
opening and closing as he drifts in and out of sleep.</p>
<p><strong>gregory pov</strong>: He stars at the horizon and the mirages
of water reflecting the jaundiced yellow sky. In the shimmering
distance, a man appears, but Gregory�s lids shut and we see darkness.
When he reopens them, the figure is more clear. It�s a man, dressed in a
black suit. Even in the distance we can recognize him. We want it to be
him.</p>
<p><strong>ext. desert rock</strong>: GREGORY can barely come to his
senses as the figure approaches. CHANDRA doesn�t even wake.</p>
<p><strong>ext. desert</strong>: We follow the figure at waist heigh as
it approaches GREGORY. It comes to a stop just in front of him.</p>
<p><strong>ext. desert rock</strong>: GREGORY is fully awake, but he
thinks he�s dreaming. He reaches out and pokes the black-clad leg of the
immaculate man standing before him - a man who doesn�t sweat even in the
sauna heat. He looks up, but the glaring sun obscures the face.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: “Oh my God. It�s… The Man.”</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: “I�ve been searching for you for a
long time, my friend.”</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: “We need you, Gregory.”</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: “What for?”</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: “To save our world.”</p>
<p><strong>agent smith.</strong>: GREGORY�S head drops back down. He
strokes CHANDRA�S hair.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: “It�s too late. We�re dead.”</p>
<p><strong>agent smith</strong>: “Do you want to live?”</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: “What for?”</p>
<p><strong>agent smith</strong>: “A better life for all. Life for her.
And for you, a chance for</p>
<p><strong>agent smith</strong>: “Interested?”</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: “This can�t be real.”</p>
<p><strong>agent smith</strong>: “You this, don�t you?”</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: “Yes.”</p>
<p><strong>agent smith</strong>: “Will you help us?”</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: “Anything.”</p>
<p><strong>cu</strong>: SMITH extends his hand. GREGORY grasps it. He
lets go, and collapses into the cool shallow waters of the lake
edge.</p>
<p><strong>ext. lake shore</strong>: THE DESERT is gone, replaced by
forest, though still under the poisoned sky of the Matrix.</p>
<p><strong>cu</strong>: AGENT SMITH. The humans are reflected in his
perfectly still glasses. CHANDRA stirs and awakens, though she doesn�t
seem to see SMITH. GREGORY, revitalized, looks around at the miracle,
and up at the mystery man.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: “Who the fuck are you?”</p>
<p><strong>agent smith</strong>: “I�m nobody. A Smith. What�s more
important, is you. We need you,</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: “First you try to kill me. Now you need
me.”</p>
<p><strong>agent smith</strong>: “Two years ago, Gregory, your parents
were killed in a terrorist</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: “So what?”</p>
<p><strong>agent smith</strong>: “The terrorists were led by a certain
individual.”</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: “I know who it was.”</p>
<p><strong>agent smith</strong>: “We need you to kill him.”</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: “What a bunch of bullshit. The whole
government can�t kill him, so how</p>
<p><strong>agent smith</strong>: “No one in the government can do what
you can.”</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: “Fuck you.”</p>
<p><strong>agent smith</strong>: “I believe we have a deal.”</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: “What are you gonna do, little man? You
looking for a trip to the</p>
<p><strong>cu</strong>: SMITH. HE removes his glasses calmly.</p>
<p><strong>cu</strong>: GREGORY. He was stunned, but he�s not out of the
fight. Not by a long shot.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: “No man can beat me.”</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: “Bring it on, pussy.”</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: “Mother fucker, what the fu -?”</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: “Ready to change your mind?”</p>
<p><strong>cu: gregory</strong>: HE can�t respond very well. Blood fills
his mouth and his face is mashed. A huge welt grows under the loafer
mark left by SMITH on the right side of his face.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: “I can teach you to beat me, you know.”</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: “Help us, and both you and her will be free
afterward.”</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: “You know it, don�t you? That there�s more to
your world than what you</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: “Yeah.”</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: “I�m going to teach you how to use the powers
you can�t even imagine.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: “Holy shit. What the -”</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: I know Kung-Fu.”</p>
<p><strong>int. cockpit</strong>: MORPHEUS and NEO sit together. The
cockpit lights are dimmed down, only the EMP pulse button glows. Outside
the ship, in the dark mists of the underworld, patches of eerie
phosphorescent moss glow on the walls. Occasionally, a squiddie will
pass over the darkened ship.</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “We�re deep in their territory.”</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “I see that.”</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “Are you rested?”</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “Yes.”</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “You know now, that you had
predecessors.”</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “Yes. I�ve heard things.”</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “What types of things?”</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “That there were others, like me, who you
thought were going to be</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “It�s true. There were others. And I
didn�t tell you right away.</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “Does this anger you?”</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “I don�t know yet. So much has happened so
fast, that I can�t decide whether or not I�m angry, or dissappointed, or
even if I should be.”</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “You shouldn�t be, Neo. You are the key in
the Oracle�s prophecy.</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “What?”</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “The destruction of The Matrix.”</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “Your coming was heralded, and it is my
destiny to prepare the world for you, and to baptize you by fire. But
from here on out, no one</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “Can we ask The Oracle.”</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “Not in this life.”</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “No one has heard from her or her
priestesses since the day Cypher</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “But she must have known, if they came to

<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “Perhaps she did.”</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “I can�t believe it. I don�t know, Morpheus, if
I�m prepared for this</p>
<p><strong>morphues</strong>: “For decades, we have fought
force-on-force, in the real world,</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “Remember, when I told you, that I�ll show
you how deep the rabbit</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “Yes.”</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “I brought you deep, yet I no longer know
the way. No one does. With every second we sink deeper than before. You

have shown you the path</p>
<p><strong>int. main deck</strong>: MORPHEUS, NEO, TRINITY, CHOI, and
NIOBE are on the chairs as they�re being JACKED IN by CIRCA and
RAZOR.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: RAZOR jumps in the operator�s chair, his
hands blur over the touchscreens and keyboard as he drops his crewmates
into the Matrix.</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “We�re going straight for the throat,
people.”</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: RAZOR and CIRCA typing like made at their
keyboards. RAZOR hits the ENTER key. They look on, transfixed with
anticipation. The screaming Matrix code grinds to a readable halt. The
slap each other�s hands and continue hacking.</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “We have the advantage of surprise. They
won�t expect us to return so</p>
<p><strong>int. abandoned warehouse</strong>: THE FIVE of them stand,
immobile, around a ringing phone as their minds filter in to their body
images. They are dressed practically in denim and leather, like blue
collar workers. Their dress wouldn�t attract the slightest bit of
attention, except for the padded coats and tote bags filled with
firepower.</p>
<p><strong>circa</strong>: “Keep your eyes out for changes, they�re
modifying things. Dial �0�</p>
<p><strong>int. abandoned warehouse</strong>: MORPHEUS holds his celly

<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “Niobe, you�re the liasion to our
operators. Neo, what do you have for</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “Where is the mainframe?”</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “The Metacortex building.”</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “What the fuck? That�s where I worked.”</p>
<p><strong>choi</strong>: “And what do you think you were doing there,
writing code for video</p>

innocent people. But, that</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “How �bout this? I just walk up to the
Metacortex building and blow it</p>
<p><strong>choi</strong>: “What, by power of will?”</p>
<p><strong>choi</strong>: “He�s joking right?”</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “We�ll fan out around the city, keeping an
eye out for you. If you�re able to accomplish this mission, we�ll phase
back into the ship. Stay in contact. If you lose your cell, contact an
operator immediately.”</p>
<p><strong>ext. abandoned warehouse</strong>: THE five of them exit.
They blend into the crowds on the street, anonymous and quiet. MORPHEUS
looks back as NEO, taller than most, heads down the street.</p>
<p><strong>niobe</strong>: “What is it?”</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “What�s going to happen? If this is it,
right now? The end?”</p>
<p><strong>niobe</strong>: “I can�t even imagine.”</p>
<p><strong>poster: international terrorists</strong>: MORPHEUS glances
at it, and continues on.</p>
<p><strong>ext. downtown street</strong>: NEO walks calmly, observing
the people that filter by. Men, women, children, all oblivious to their
true nature.</p>
<p><strong>homeless</strong>: “Spare a quarter, buddy?”</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “How �bout a quarter mil?”</p>
<p><strong>ext. forest glade</strong>: SMITH and GREGORY fight in the
glade. SMITH is always one step ahead. HE is a cruel sensei, and doesn�t
pull punches. But with every blow GREGORY takes, he rebounds and attacks
again.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: “Fuck.”</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: “Pain is only weakness leaving your body.
When you are sufficiently</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: “Tell me about what is happening. What�s
wrong with the world?”</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: “Get up and fight.”</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: “The world is not for you.”</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: “What do you mean?”</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: “You�re not human, Gregory. That�s why you
don�t fit in. That�s why</p>

<p><strong>smith</strong>: “Here.”</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: “She doesn�t remember our encounter. She�s
fine. Don�t worry.”</p>
<p><strong>int. office building</strong>: AGENT BROWN is staring down at
the ground. ACROSS THE STREET, NEO is walking toward his building.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: “He�s back.”</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: “I�ll be there. Execute the defense
plan.”</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: “Come with me. But only watch. You�re not
ready to engage in a fight</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: “Why not?”</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: “Because if you haven�t defeated me yet, you
won�t defeat them.”</p>
<p><strong>ext. rooftop</strong>: GREGORY finds himself alone on the top
of the MAKARAO hotel, overlooking METACORTEX PLAZA.</p>
<p><strong>ext. street</strong>: The METACORTEX building stands across
the street. NEO has been along this road a thousand times, but in
another lifetime.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: NEO�S POV: The building is a massive tower
of glowing shimmering energy, no more real than a three-dimensional
polygon.</p>
<p><strong>ext. building rooftop</strong>: MORPHEUS and NIOBE stand atop
a building a few blocks away, looking toward the Metacortex
building.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: the first level. The exterior glass
disappears, vaporizing in a million crystal shards that melt into the
air, exposing the hive of office cubicles and corridors within. The
walls, desks and cubicles vaporize, leaving a few hundred people -
office workers, security, maintenance men, standing with nothing between
them.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: the bottom of the building. One can look
straight through the entire building. WE go through the empty building,
passing dazed people, until we pass out the other side, and come to NEO.
HE looks up. The office building is supported by nothing. Slowly, it
descends on the stunned people. They rush, screaming, some laughing in
hysteria, before the ceiling can come down on them. The last few flee
just before the ceiling touches the ground. The second floor melts away
just like the first.</p>
<p><strong>ext. building rooftop</strong>: NIOBE and MORPHEUS stare on
in amazement as the building collapses, floor by floor.</p>
<p><strong>niobe</strong>: “He�s doing it.”</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “I knew it.”</p>
<p><strong>ext. street</strong>: CHOI and TRINITY look up in the air at
the roof of the METACORTEX building, standing beyond a block of
buildings. It sinks toward the ground as a flood of people come
screaming around the corner.</p>
<p><strong>choi</strong>: “It can�t be this easy.”</p>
<p><strong>trinity</strong>: “It�s not over yet.”</p>
<p><strong>man�s voice</strong>: “Not by a long shot.”</p>
<p><strong>cu</strong>: TRINITY�S FACE. SOMEONE plants the barrel of a
silver Desert Eagle .45 against her temple. TRINITY whips her head
backward as it fires. We drop into BULLET TIME as the flame and
concussion blossoms in front of her face, ripping her sunglasses off as
she drops backward, pulling a pair of MAC-10 Uzis from under her
jacket.</p>
<p><strong>real time</strong>: What remains of BROWN flies forward. CHOI
helps TRINITY up and the retreat into the building and take cover under
a window. Through the window, we see military trucks, filled with
troops, charging down the street, toward the Metacortex plaza. After the
trucks come rumbling, black-painted M1A2 ABRAMS tanks. A black APACHE
HELICOPTER flies over the convoy.</p>
<p><strong>choi</strong>: “Holy fucking shit.”</p>
<p><strong>trinity</strong>: “We�ve stirred up the hornet�s nest
now.”</p>
<p><strong>int. metacortex office</strong>: AGENT SMITH and JONES stare
down into the plaza. The building shakes slightly as it descends.</p>
<p><strong>ext. rooftop</strong>: MORPHEUS and NIOBE stare from the
rooftop.</p>
<p><strong>ext. metacortex plaza</strong>: The air rumbles as the
building continues to gently collapse. The sky flashes, and massive
streaks of lighting blast across it like cracks in reality.</p>
<p><strong>cu: soldiers</strong>: They line their weapons on NEO. They
are nervous</p>
<p><strong>private</strong>: “This is impossible. What�s going on?”</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: “Just keep him in your sites,
soldier.”</p>
<p><strong>cu: tank gunner</strong>: HIS eye is glued to the tank site
and his trigger finger on the fire button.</p>
<p><strong>pov: tank site</strong>: The green crosshairs sit on NEO�S
chest.</p>
<p><strong>cu: neo</strong>: His eyes open, but the building continues
to collapse. He stares up at a mirrored window, and somehow, straight
into the eyes of:</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: “Open fire.”</p>
<p><strong>cu</strong>: MACHINE GUNNER. With an M-249 SAW, he blazes
away at NEO, only to be shredded by his own bullets. A private takes a
shot at NEO, and a bullet slaps into his shoulder. REALIZING what�s
happening, he drops his weapon. THE SOLDIERS are dropping like flies.
The firing quickly subsides.</p>
<p><strong>int. helicopter cockpit</strong>: NEO is targeted on an LCD
screen.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: “Fox One.”</p>
<p><strong>cu: agm-65 hellfire ground-to-air-missile</strong>: The
missile drops from its release claws and ignites, accelerating off
screen.</p>
<p><strong>pov: hellfire nose cam</strong>: The missile flies
horizontally over the plaza, then pitches up, and back down at NEO. He
looks at it, and at the last second the nose goes back up.</p>
<p><strong>ext. plaza</strong>: The missile swoops up over him, leaving
him in its exhaust smoke.</p>
<p><strong>pov: hellfire nose cam</strong>: THE missile banks, panning
across the city, until it locks onto the helicopter from which it
originated.</p>
<p><strong>int. helicopter cockpit</strong>: THE missile bears down the
chopper.</p>
<p><strong>cu: pilot</strong>: HE�S TOO stunned to move. Mouth agape, he
can only watch as:</p>
<p><strong>ext. helicopter</strong>: IT�S BLOWN to fiery pieces, and
comes tumbling down, landing on the street as soldiers and civilians
flee.</p>
<p><strong>tank commander</strong>: “Fire!”</p>
<p><strong>ext. m1a2 abrams</strong>: WE drop into bullet time as a cone
of fire - bigger than the tank and the shape of a pine tree, blows out
of the barrel, pushing the tank back. From the fire streaks a HEAT
round, white hot, leaving a laser like tracer as it bears down on
NEO.</p>
<p><strong>real time</strong>: THE TRACER stops in front of NEO, and out
of the air the HEAT round appears. Suspended in air, it shakes with
violence. It accelerates</p>
<p><strong>int. tank turret</strong>: THE gunner screams as the BREECH
explodes, blocking our view.</p>
<p><strong>ext. tank</strong>: The tanks explodes like a 60-ton hand
grenade, plowing soldiers onto their faces, consuming the unlucky ones
close to it, and throwing the 30-ton turret straight up, 10 yards into
the air. It rotates, aflame, and comes crashing down on a nearby
commander and his radio man.</p>
<p><strong>int. metacortex office</strong>: THE EXPLOSION shakes the
building. The scene below is a complete route. Black smoke billows up
from the flaming wrecks. The remaining tanks aren�t retreating - the
crews are piling out and running. The Apache helicopters turn tail and
run.</p>
<p><strong>agent jones</strong>: “The plan is not working.”</p>
<p><strong>agent smith</strong>: “No shit.”</p>
<p><strong>agent brown</strong>: “What about your prot�g�?”</p>
<p><strong>agent smith</strong>: “He�s not ready yet. I�ll deal with
this myself.”</p>
<p><strong>agent jones</strong>: “You can�t beat him.”</p>
<p><strong>agent smith</strong>: “I�ve been altered. I�m Smith,
2.0.”</p>
<p><strong>cu: smith</strong>: HE clenches his teeth, as though he�s
girding himself for something.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: “Kill the others. I�ll take care of
this.”</p>
<p><strong>int. main bridge</strong>: RAZOR is at his operator chair,
surrounded by consoles. Some of the Matrix code screens are in blue,
others in red, at least one in green. The code on the green screen
starts pouring down at an incredible rate.</p>
<p><strong>razor</strong>: “Fuck.”</p>
<p><strong>ext. roof</strong>: MORPHEUS answers his phone.</p>
<p><strong>razor</strong>: “They�re about to pull something. Processing
power is pouring into the agent programs and they�re locking onto your
3-D grid displacements.</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “Send through ghosts to confuse their
lock.”</p>
<p><strong>razor</strong>: “Got it.”</p>
<p><strong>int. main bridge</strong>: THE GHOST program is loaded. We
see 3-D images of Morpheus and the others flash across the screen.</p>
<p><strong>int. office building</strong>: SMITH STANDS alone, his
comrades have disappeared.</p>
<p><strong>ext. office</strong>: THE mirrored glass of Smith�s office
wavers, then explodes towards us. SMITH jumps, and we pan down to follow
his descent. He smacks into the pavement on his feet in front of
NEO.</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “You�re back.”</p>
<p><strong>cu: smith</strong>: He nods.</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “And you have a ponytail now.”</p>
<p><strong>“hey!”</strong>: NEO turns, and SMITH pushes him hard in the
opposite direction to face:</p>
<p><strong>ext. rooftop</strong>: MORPHEUS and NIOBE stare on as the
fight rages.</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “We can only watch.”</p>
<p><strong>ext. plaza</strong>: THE ASSAULT on NEO continues. He
struggles, unable to concentrate long enough to find a way to fight
back.</p>
<p><strong>int. main deck</strong>: RAZOR bangs away at the
keyboard.</p>
<p><strong>razor</strong>: “Four fucking agents, no wonder so much
processing power is devoted to</p>
<p><strong>ext. roof</strong>: A BIRD flying by NIOBE and MORPHEUS slows
its flight, slows its flapping, and freezes.</p>
<p><strong>cu</strong>: MORPHEUS. A pink lightning bolt freezes as it
streaks across the sky, sealing the world�s light in an a light
rouge.</p>
<p><strong>ext. city street</strong>: Near the plaza, panicked civilians
slow, and fall to the ground as though they�re passing out.</p>
<p><strong>int. main deck</strong>: Razor stares at the data pouring
down the screens.</p>
<p><strong>razor</strong>: “No goddamned way.”</p>
<p><strong>razor</strong>: “Operator.”</p>
<p><strong>ext. roof</strong>: MORPHEUS is on the phone</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “What the hell�s going on?”</p>
<p><strong>razor</strong>: “They�re putting all the coppertops to sleep.
They froze the Matrix.”</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “Why?”</p>
<p><strong>razor</strong>: “All processing power is being re-diverted to
the agent program.”</p>
<p><strong>niobe</strong>: “Morpheus, look!”</p>
<p><strong>ext. street</strong>: The passed-out people stand, and one by
one, MORPH into AGENT SMITHS. It happens over, and over, until dozens,
then hundreds, are marching on the plaza.</p>
<p><strong>ext. plaza</strong>: NEO reaches back and puts his hands on
either side of SMITH�S head. As he�s being pummeled from the front, he
squeezes and screams. His screams are mixed with SMITH�S. The agent�s
head deforms as we�re hear a sickening crack. Suddenly, the body reverts
back to that of the original owner, a security guard, and the head
simply EXPLODES.</p>
<p><strong>cu: neo</strong>: AS his hand passes over his face, it is
refreshed, anew, perfect again. He surveys the wall-to-wall SMITHS.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: “NEO, leave the Matrix. You know not what
you�re doing.”</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “Well, is that right?”</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “No!”</p>
<p><strong>ext. roof</strong>: GREGORY sees the building exploding, and
runs. He smashes through an access door.</p>
<p><strong>int. stairway</strong>: GREGORY hurtles down the stairs, one
at a time.</p>
<p><strong>ext. metacortex building</strong>: THE building is frozen,
mid-explosion. TONS of pieces hanging in the air, suspended only by
frozen tendrils of fire and arms of smoke and debris.</p>
<p><strong>cu: agent brown</strong>: With his hand on his ear piece, he
comes out the elevator door, slowly. Pistol drawn, he looks around the
corner.</p>
<p><strong>int. main deck</strong>: RAZOR dials the phone. MORPHEUS
picks up.</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “Yes.”</p>
<p><strong>razor</strong>: “They�re hitting your ghosts.”</p>
<p><strong>razor</strong>: “What the -”</p>
<p><strong>ext. rooftop</strong>: MORPHEUS looks at the phone and
redials. RAZOR comes through, his voice digitized and distorted.</p>
<p><strong>razor</strong>: “They�re cutting comes, get to the access
point on Laxe -”</p>
<p><strong>int. empty building</strong>: CHOI and TRINITY hide in the
shadows of an empty room, watching the battle. TRINITY�S cell rings. She
answers silently.</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “Let�s go. Laxe Three.”</p>
<p><strong>trinity</strong>: “What about Neo?”</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “We can do nothing to help him. We�ll only
get in his way.”</p>
<p><strong>int. lobby</strong>: GREGORY stumbles into the lobby.
Slumbering bodies lie everywhere, slumped over desks, half-in chairs, on
the ground.</p>
<p><strong>ext. plaza</strong>: HE exits into the street. The scene is
one from HELL.</p>
<p><strong>cu: neo</strong>: THE SMITHS overwhelm him with sheer
numbers. NEO is a blur, a human chainsaw now, crushing or smashing them
all, but they crowd on all sides. The bodies pile up as they fall, and
NEO finds himself stepping up the rubbery mass of corpses. A few more
smashed SMITHS fall, morph back into their stolen forms, and NEO is
KNEE-DEEP IN THE DEAD.</p>
<p><strong>ext. plaza</strong>: NEO struggles to fly, and as he does,
he�s pulling a stalagtite of black suits, clinging like iron filings on
a magnet.</p>
<p><strong>ext. alley day</strong>: THE sky and Matrix are still frozen.
TRINITY and CHOI make their way along cautiously, leapfrogging from
cover to cover. They pause behind a dumpster, and just before looking
out, there�s the sound of metal tapping metal, twice.</p>
<p><strong>trinity</strong>: “Is it clear?”</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “I smell an ambush.”</p>
<p><strong>niobe</strong>: “Me too. Too quiet.”</p>
<p><strong>choi</strong>: “Too quiet? The world is frozen. I�ll go
first.”</p>
<p><strong>ext. plaza</strong>: IT�S a sea of the dead. From its center,
NEO emerges, soaked in blood, gagging and gasping for breath. He
stumbles over them. Shocked and crazed, he glimpses the Metacortex
building. It�s in one piece again, unharmed.</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “Morpheus, pick up.”</p>
<p><strong>ext. alley - day</strong>: THEY weigh their options. Finally,
MORPHUES gives the nod to CHOI.</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “Go.”</p>
<p><strong>choi</strong>: “And remember, kids, when you�re in a war,
never volunteer yourself!”</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: “Choi? Oh my God, I haven�t seen you for
months.”</p>
<p><strong>ext. alley - day</strong>: TRINITY is looking around the
corner. She pulls back into the alley.</p>
<p><strong>trinity</strong>: “Casanova just ran into an old flame.”</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: “No. Fuck you, Choi, you just think you can
come and go when you</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: ” - you�ll tell me why you don�t call, why
you, you, what are you</p>
<p><strong>choi</strong>: “The jacket stops fragmentation. Sometimes
they bomb the phones. Kiss</p>
<p><strong>cu: phone</strong>: His hand grabs the phone. We hear the
dialtone, and he mashes down one of the numbers of the keypad. The
number tone rises in pitch to a crescendo. WE pull back and:</p>
<p><strong>ext. alley - day</strong>: They take cover from the blast as
people all over the street are knocked flat.</p>
<p><strong>ext. street - day</strong>: THE PHONE BOOTH is obliterated.
Miraculously, CHOI and the woman are still under the cover of the
jacket. THROWING the smoking jacket off them, CHOI screams in agony as
he grasps the smoldering stump of his right shoulder. The arm is
history.</p>
<p><strong>choi</strong>: “You weren�t lucky.”</p>
<p><strong>choi</strong>: “You still want me to call you? Ha ha ha!”</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “This way.”</p>
<p><strong>niobe</strong>: “Tanks, or agents?”</p>
<p><strong>trinity</strong>: “Tanks.”</p>
<p><strong>choi</strong>: “Yeah, tanks a lot.”</p>
<p><strong>cu: tanks</strong>: THREE ABRAMS stop in the street. Their
turrets swing into place with terrifying quickness and precision.</p>
<p><strong>cu: choi</strong>: TRACERS zoom in on him. A tank round
blasts by, and the wall of air kicks him to his side. He continues to
fire even as a bullet, followed by another, blasts through the middle of
his body. More and more bullets smack into him, blasting chunks of meat
and viscera out the back.</p>
<p><strong>ext. street day</strong>: TRINITY and NIOBE take one side of
the street, running and shooting simultaneously. THEY reach the
buildings on the side and NIOBE goes STRAIGHT UP THE FA�ADE OF THE
BUILDING, as TRINITY jumps from cover to cover, cart wheeling through
tracer fire and bullets.</p>
<p><strong>cu: choi</strong>: HE WILL NOT FALL, and a hose of lead
drills into him, taking his body apart piece by piece. Bullets take away
pieces of his head, neck, and torso, and in one final wave of fire, he
is disintegrated, leaving his machine gun, barrel smoking, spinning in
the air, firing still. The arm is still attached and finger clenching on
the trigger. It is the last piece of CHOI to fall.</p>
<p><strong>cu: soldier</strong>: In slow motion, he pulls a spoon from a
grenade. Somehow, the metal ring reaches TRINITY�S ears.</p>
<p><strong>cu: trinity</strong>: She slaps a magazine into her pistol,
pulls the action and comes out from under cover just enough to see the
soldier releasing the grenade. She fires, hitting the grenade. IT
explodes directly over the group of soldiers, flattening them to the
ground.</p>
<p><strong>ext. street - day</strong>: The other end of the street fills
with soldiers, and AGENT BROWN.</p>
<p><strong>cu: agent brown</strong>: HE surveys the scene, and
immediately draws and fires, running full bore for the rebels.</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “The garage, hurry!”</p>
<p><strong>ext. street - day</strong>: AGENT BROWN and his men rush into
position around the building the rebels are hiding in.</p>
<p><strong>int. countach - day</strong>: THE street scene spins before
them. TRINITY is at the wheel, a broken and dusty MORPHEUS sitting next
to her. The tach is redlining as the car rips up the street. Pedestrians
dive for cover.</p>
<p><strong>ext. street - day</strong>: Soldiers pick themselves up just
in time to hear another engine - a super powerful track bike, emerges
from the burnt rubber smoke screen. A wheely bar on the back of the bike
keeps it from flipping around the rear tire as it accelerates like a
bullet out of a barrel. There isn�t even time to take a shot until she�s
gone.</p>
<p><strong>int. countach - day</strong>: THEY rocket up the entry to a
highway, ripping past cars by driving up the breakdown lane. Once they
hit a straightaway Trinity floors it, and the speedo creeps up past 130
as they dodge in and out of cars.</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “Keep your foot on the gas. Heal
thyself.”</p>
<p><strong>trinity</strong>: “Any luck?”</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “None. They�ve killed city-wide
comms.”</p>
<p><strong>trinity</strong>: “Then the agents are out of touch with each
other.”</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “They can�t track us, but that gives them
more time to destroy our</p>
<p><strong>trinity</strong>: “What about Niobe?”</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “She knows to meet us there.”</p>
<p><strong>ext. highway - day</strong>: NIOBE�s bike sizzles down the
highway, insanely lane splitting at over 100 miles per hour. The wheely
bar is folded up against the rear wheel. A dual stream of vehicles spit
by her like giant machine-gun bullets. She zooms out of view.</p>
<p><strong>ext. street - day</strong>: GREGORY slows from a run. He
looks back as police cars and ambulances race toward the Metacortex
building. He can�t shake what he�s just witnessed. He looks forward,
only to run into:</p>
<p><strong>agent smith</strong>: GREGORY freezes, then bursts into
questions.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: “What the fuck just happened?”</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: “We need you, Gregory. Will you help us stop
this?”</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: “I can stop this?”</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: “Yes.”</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: “Alright. But how can I fight him?”</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: “I will give you the power you need.”</p>
<p><strong>int. apartment building - day</strong>: THE building is old,
crumbling, and inside painted a horrid green that no sane person could
find attractive. The humble place is home to THE</p>
<p><strong>oracle.</strong>: NEO exits an elevator. Recomposed and
dressed normally, he walks up and down the hall, trying to remember
which apartment she lived in.</p>
<p><strong>priestess</strong>: “Neo.”</p>
<p><strong>priestess</strong>: “The Oracle is anxious to see you.”</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “I was on to you the whole time. I only came in
here to isolate you,</p>
<p><strong>agent jones</strong>: “What are you waiting for?”</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “I realized, that I can�t destroy you -”</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: ” - without destroying the Matrix itself.”</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: “You killed me too easy last time.”</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: “And if you kill us -”</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: “We�ll only come back like him.”</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “I know.”</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: “So, why don�t you take it all down?”</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “The Matrix?”</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: “Yes.”</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “I can. But if I destroy the Matrix, everyone
within it will die.”</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: “I take it the great Morpheus failed to
mention this?”</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “How many people are in it?”</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: “Six and a half billion.”</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: “Could you destroy us?”</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “I could.”</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: “What does that make you feel like? God?”</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: “This is getting tiresome. Where do we go
from here?”</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “IF you cut the power that the Matrix supplies
to your armies, I�ll</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: “Idiot. We don�t care about life, we care
about victory.”</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “Why?”</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “You mean, lives.”</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: “Who do you think started this war, boy? Your
kind tried to kill us</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: “But you didn�t. You�re not as tough as you
think.”</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “We�ll see.”</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “Stop! I don�t want to fight you! You�re
human!”</p>
<p><strong>ext. rooftop - day</strong>: NEO and GREGORY SMASH through
the roof, flying upward, like a missile, past us.</p>
<p><strong>cu: neo</strong>: HIS FACE is contorted in rage as he rockets
upward. GREGORY is barely conscious. Seeing this, NEO stops, and flings
Gregory�s body violently earthward.</p>
<p><strong>cu: gregor</strong>: HE is in shock somehow as he sees NEO
flying away. He clenches his fists and flexes his body, then looks
down.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: “Holy shit!”</p>
<p><strong>int. sewer - day</strong>: NEO stands. Offscreen, we can here
choking breaths. Neo looks down. Gregor lies twisted on a concrete slab,
impaled multiple times through the chest by snapped, rusty rebar. He
takes one last breath, and his eyes half-close.</p>
<p><strong>cu: gregory</strong>: HIS eyes blink, and he follows NEO�s
departure. Choking, unable to breath with the rebar through him, he
writhes. There�s nothing for him to grab to pull himself off the
steel.</p>
<p><strong>ext. desert highway - sunset</strong>: THE Countach and bike
zip down a long, perfectly flat empty road. A brown sunset plagues the
horizon. There is no civilization in sight.</p>
<p><strong>int. countach - sunset</strong>: MORPHEUS tries his cell
again. This time, it reaches the Neb.</p>
<p><strong>int. main deck - night</strong>: RAZOR and CIRCA are both
operating the consoles.</p>
<p><strong>razor</strong>: “Operator.”</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “Good to hear you�re still there.”</p>
<p><strong>razor</strong>: “Jesus, you too. Where the fuck are you?”</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “About two hundred miles east of the city,
on highway 315. We need an</p>
<p><strong>razor</strong>: “Coming up on your left, ten miles, a rest
stop.”</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “I don�t remember an exit there.”</p>
<p><strong>razor</strong>: “Gimme five minutes.”</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “Out.”</p>
<p><strong>int. main deck</strong>: RAZOR clears the screen in front of
him and cracks his fingers. He looks at Circa.</p>
<p><strong>circa</strong>: “They�re OK?”</p>
<p><strong>razor</strong>: “Gotta get �em out. They need an exit
program.”</p>
<p><strong>cu</strong>: Keyboard. RAZOR�S fingers fly at inhuman speeds
over the keys. Data pours down the console as he blazes away. Finally,
he hits �enter� so hard it rocks the station. RAZOR turns to Circa as
Matrix code resumes its cascade down the screens.</p>
<p><strong>razor</strong>: “Yes! Did you like that?”</p>
<p><strong>int. countach sunset</strong>: MORPHEUS� phone rings. He
answers. It�s Razor.</p>
<p><strong>razor</strong>: “Exit ready sir.”</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “Check the phone for bombs.”</p>
<p><strong>int. main deck - night</strong>: CIRCA looks over some data
and shakes her head.</p>
<p><strong>circa</strong>: “It�s clear.”</p>
<p><strong>razor</strong>: “It�s all set. There�s a pair of cops at the
rest stop, though.”</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “Not a problem.”</p>
<p><strong>ext. rest stop - sunset</strong>: THE Countach skids to a
stop, kicking up a massive dust cloud that hides the car. We hear the
door slide, and the massive black-clad figure of MORPHEUS emerges from
the dust.</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “I thought Razor said their were two
cops.”</p>
<p><strong>int. bathroom house - sunset</strong>: A ROOKIE cop, his face
to young for a razor, is shaking as he peeks through a crack in the
door, through which he sees the terrorists who just wasted his partner.
He finishes buckling his pants, and draws his service pistol, only to
shake in pain as his body morphs.</p>
<p><strong>int. main deck - night</strong>: RAZOR and CIRCA see the
agent morph as the code flies down the screen.</p>
<p><strong>razor</strong>: “Fuck, fuck fuck!”</p>
<p><strong>ext. rest stop - sunset</strong>: THEY smell something�s
wrong. They move, back to back in a triangle, for the phone booth,
weapons draw and looking in all direction at once.</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “Niobe, you first.”</p>
<p><strong>trinity</strong>: “Bullshit, it�s my turn.”</p>
<p><strong>niobe</strong>: “Junior ranks leave first.”</p>
<p><strong>int. main deck</strong>: TRINITY�S body spasms violently
against her harness as her life signs go berserk. She�s not dead, but
death is only seconds away. Circa screams, but Razor is locked, staring
at the screen with the intensity from which he derived his name.</p>
<p><strong>ext. rest stop - night</strong>: MORPHEUS and NIOBE open
fire. Smith shudders, flickers violently, his body moving too fast to
follow as the two rebels empty their clips at him. The actions of the
guns stop in the open position, barrels and empty chambers smoking, as
the last empty shells patter to the ground.</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “Get her out.”</p>
<p><strong>niobe</strong>: “Come on! Go through, Trinity! God damnit
don�t give up!”</p>
<p><strong>int. main deck</strong>: CIRCA stands over Trinity as the
rebels blue eyes flutter open. Her whole body goes into a seizure and
she chokes and screams as she grabs Circa.</p>
<p><strong>circa</strong>: “You�re safe, you�re safe!”</p>
<p><strong>ext. rest stop</strong>: MORPHEUS charges SMITH. Smith
ignores reloads him, and sights in on the exposed back of Niobe as she
is reaching up to put the phone back on the hook. As the sights rest
right between her shoulder blades, Morpheus grabs his gun with both
hands. He squeezes off one shot, the action freeze back on an empty
chamber, before Morpheus throws his hands up in the air</p>
<p><strong>int. main deck - night</strong>: RAZOR pounds the edge of the
console as he watches the screen.</p>
<p><strong>razor</strong>: “Crazy mothers!”</p>
<p><strong>razor</strong>: “What�s wrong with her?”</p>
<p><strong>circa</strong>: “Her body�s dying but her mind won�t
quit.”</p>
<p><strong>ext. rest stop</strong>: Morpheus and Smith clash in the dust
- punches, kicks, and blocks coming too fast to see. Smith is wailing on
Morpheus, but Morpheus sneaks in a kick that separates them. They take
stances a good two distances away. They�re about to go at it again
when:</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: “I should have killed you the first chance I
had.”</p>
<p><strong>razor</strong>: “Go!”</p>
<p><strong>int. main deck - night</strong>: RAZOR is strapped into one
of the interface chairs, his eyes closed.</p>
<p><strong>ext. rest stop</strong>: HALF-DEAD MORPHEUS drags NIOBE to
the booth.</p>
<p><strong>razor</strong>: “Come on, tough guy, come got some
Razor.”</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “Reload me.”</p>
<p><strong>circa</strong>: “All right.”</p>
<p><strong>ext. booth - sunset</strong>: MORPHEUS disappears for a
second, then reappears. Now he is perfectly clean, and immaculately
dressed. He replaces his sunglasses and kicks through the remains of the
booth, walking toward the fight as he produces new weapons, heavy with
ammo, from his long coat.</p>
<p><strong>int. main deck - night</strong>: CIRCA helps MORPHEUS off the
interface chair. Razor is triumphant.</p>
<p><strong>razor</strong>: “Did you see that? We beat him! A fucking
agent! He gave up!”</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “Where is Neo?”</p>
<p><strong>circa</strong>: “Haven�t heard from him. The city is still
cut off from the rest of</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “Why does it still exist? Why hasn�t he
destroyed it yet?”</p>
<p><strong>razor</strong>: “Maybe he can�t.”</p>
<p><strong>trinity</strong>: “Is he even alive? Is he captured?”</p>
<p><strong>razor</strong>: “Last we saw he was trying to blow up the
building. Haven�t locked</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “What? Why not?”</p>
<p><strong>circa</strong>: “Call me crazy, but I think he�s masking his
own displacement</p>
<p><strong>razor</strong>: “His carrier signal just goes nowhere. But
there is data going back</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “I found him once. I�ll find him
again.”</p>
<p><strong>int. penthouse apartment - night</strong>: The apartment is
luxuriously laid out and furnished. Gregory sits on a leather couch,
watching whatever on the tube with the sound off. He absentmindedly
manipulates a quarter over and around his fingers. Finally, he stops and
looks at the quarter.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: “So, you really don�t have any idea how you
got here?”</p>
<p><strong>chandra</strong>: “No. I only remember being on the
bike.”</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: “Yeah, you took a pretty good knock on the
head. Do you know how we</p>
<p><strong>chandra</strong>: “Duh. We broke in. We don�t own a
penthouse.”</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: “What if I said we did?”</p>
<p><strong>chandra</strong>: “I�d say you�re insane.”</p>
<p><strong>int. burnt-out cathedral - night</strong>: NEO sits with his
back against a blackened brick wall, staring ahead. He�s in the belfry
of an ancient, destroyed cathedral, among the pigeon nests, soot, and
bird crap.</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “Neo.”</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “Morpheus! Holy shit! You won�t believe what
happened.”</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “I know.”</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “I couldn�t do it. Morpheus, there�s a
problem.”</p>
<p><strong>int. main deck - night</strong>: MORPHEUS has the headset on.
He stands and surveys NEO.</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “Yes, there is a problem. The Matrix
exists.”</p>
<p><strong>ext. burnt-out cathedral - night</strong>: NEO�S relief fades
into confusion.</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “I know. I�m sorry.”</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “And the problem is…”</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “Uh, it�s impossible. If the Matrix is
destroyed, the people within the system will die. They will all die.
There has to be a different</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “Morpheus? Did you know this?”</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “I didn�t say things would be easy,
Neo.”</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “No.”</p>
<p><strong>int. main deck - night</strong>: MORPHEUS isn�t happy about
what he has to tell his prot�g�, but there is no bending his will. The
others look on soberly.</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “Neo, the Matrix… it�s not real. And it�s
up to you to end it.”</p>
<p><strong>ext. burnt-out cathedral - night</strong>: NEO can�t stand
the reality of the situation. He�s coming apart.</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “No, Morpheus, this can�t be! We can�t do this!
We have to get the</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “Even if we could somehow get to them
without cutting through their defenses, there�s no way we can
rehabilitate billions of people. They</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “You can do it. You can free us.”</p>
<p><strong>neo</strong>: “Why me? Why the fuck do I have to do
this?”</p>
<p><strong>int. main deck - night</strong>: Everyone is watching
Morpheus, and no one can quite believe what is happening.</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “You know what needs to be done. Time is
short. Make up your mind. The only way you�re getting out of the Matrix
is through its destruction.”</p>
<p><strong>ext. burnt-out cathedral - night</strong>: Neo hears the line
click dead. He can�t believe what has happened.</p>
<p><strong>int. main deck - night</strong>: MORPHEUS drops the headset
on the operations console. He types a few commands on the keyboard, then
addresses the crew.</p>
<p><strong>morpheus</strong>: “No one goes in. He�s on his own.”</p>
<p><strong>ext. burnt-out cathedral - night</strong>: Neo closes the
cell phone. He reaches to tuck it away, then pauses, looking at it. He
drops it to the ground and walks on.</p>
