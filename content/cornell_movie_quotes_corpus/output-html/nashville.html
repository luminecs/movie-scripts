<p><strong>3. norman</strong>: 4. CONNIE WHITE</p>
<p><strong>12. linnea</strong>: 13. BARBARA JEAN</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: You want a ride into town?</p>
<p><strong>sueleen</strong>: You bet.</p>
<p><strong>sueleen</strong>: Got me an audition tonight.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Well, you just remember, if you can’t kick
front, kick back, ’cause at least you’re kicking… Ten minutes, okay?</p>
<p><strong>sueleen</strong>: I’ve just been waiting for the right spot
to sing in… I’m so nervous…</p>
<p><strong>sueleen</strong>: I’m good, though. There ain’t but one
Sueleen Gay – I don’t mean to be conceited, but really it’s true. I’ve
been taking special coaching lessons from Zeke Willard – he’s just
wonderful. Teaches you how to phrase; that’s really important. And
breathing. Well, you know all about that. Anyway, I wrote this song.</p>
<p><strong>sueleen</strong>: Oh, listen, I really do go on. Here’s your
check. Sure has been nice talking to you.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Sorry. He sees a tape recorder and gets
upset.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: He’s my father.</p>
<p><strong>opal</strong>: Haven Hamilton is your father? Can you arrange
an interview?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Who the hell is playing piano? Get that
hippie out of here… He’s got a tin ear. I asked for Pig, dammit. I’m
moving on ’cause I gotta get to the airport. When you get my backups
straight, then we’ll talk about cutting this tune here.</p>
<p><strong>opal</strong>: Excuse me, sir. I’m here putting together a
film. I would like to ask some questions.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Foreigner?</p>
<p><strong>opal</strong>: I’m from BBC television.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Where the hell is that?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Linnea.</p>
<p><strong>linnea</strong>: How you doing, Haven?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: oh, fine. Couldn’t be better.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: You ladies got room for a spare?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>l.a. joan</strong>: ’Bye… nice talking to you.</p>
<p><strong>green</strong>: Joan?</p>
<p><strong>l.a. joan</strong>: Did you see who that was?</p>
<p><strong>green</strong>: Glad to see you. Ester’ll be glad, too.</p>
<p><strong>l.a. joan</strong>: He is just wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>green</strong>: I’1l get your bag.</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: Am I late?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Late! Oh, Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Delbert, how are you?</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: I’m fine. This here is John Triplette.
Triplette, like you to meet the Honorary Mayor, Haven Hamilton.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Good to meet you. Bud, have them move the
horses.</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: Pleasure</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Still inside the plane posing for pictures
and signing autographs. She’s got a new album cut again. She’ll be down
in a minute. But she’ll be late for the Opera if she doesn’t hurry. Bud,
get the plane on the walkie-talkie.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: They don’t seem to be answering. The ambulance
boys are here, though. Barnett always expects them to get there like a
shot. That thing only goes a hundred fall bore with the sirens
going.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Thank you, Bud.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Bud, tell them to move the horses. Promised
this strip would be spic and span.</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: Listen, we’ll go get the car and come back.
This’l1 be going on for a while.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: You bet. She’s probably talking to somebody
about their sick child. You know how she is.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Hi, Norman.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Sure is nice to see you all again. I never
thought I’d see you again after the last time.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Oh, Norman, you worry too much.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Norman, how are you?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Fine. Just fine.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Sure have missed you all, though. Oh,
where’s Tom? Isn’t he with you?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Don’t worry about old Tom.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Have you thought about your future and what
America needs to examine…</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: How long was she out?</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: Not too long. But she keeps passing
out.</p>
<p><strong>barbara jean</strong>: Just give your manna that vitamin E.
Makes a world of difference.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Here she is again.</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: Okay, let’s get her to the wagon.</p>
<p><strong>green</strong>: Eater’s been asking for you.</p>
<p><strong>l.a. joan</strong>: Uh huh.</p>
<p><strong>green</strong>: She’s been in the hospital two weeks
yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>l.a. joan</strong>: You know anything about the stations
here?</p>
<p><strong>green</strong>: It’s hard to say. Doctors thought she’d come
home a week ago. All it was was appendix.</p>
<p><strong>l.a. joan</strong>: All they got is advertisements. Just like
L.A.</p>
<p><strong>green</strong>: Did an exploratory and according to them, she
needed an overhaul.</p>
<p><strong>l.a. joan</strong>: Well, I could use one, especially if I’m
pregnant.</p>
<p><strong>green</strong>: What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>l.a. joan</strong>: I said, maybe I’ll change my name
again.</p>
<p><strong>green</strong>: I see… Well, those doctors are real miracle
workers.</p>
<p><strong>l.a. joan</strong>: But not unless Nashville really inspires
me.</p>
<p><strong>green</strong>: Maybe you can look after me a little.</p>
<p><strong>l.a. joan</strong>: That Tom sure is cute.</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: We had these two city boys come in last week.
One or them said his Ford truck had cut off his foot. The other one said
that wasn’t true. Then the first said he looked just like Eddie Black
when he said that…</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Bud, would you be sure to get the oil
changed?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Ya… where do you want me to take it?</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: Do you remember Eddie Black? He had those
blue eyes.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Where you always take it. There’s nothing
special about this time.</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: And they started pounding on each other. But
the one without the foot was strongest.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Bud, you’re going to have to show up at the
hospital tar me I gotta get back to that session.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Okay. Anything you want me to say?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Say I had to get back to the session. ~ God –
All school did for you, you can put in a thimble.</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: The cops came through and broke it up. I
finally just had to call Chet and say, ‘Chet, get over here. There are
two old bays here breaking up the furniture…’</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Is that what you’re going to sing?</p>
<p><strong>sueleen</strong>: No – That’s exercises. My coach says you
have to do exercise because the vocal chords are muscle and need to be
stretched. Every time you stretch them, the middle part sets stronger.
That’s the place where I sing.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: You think I got any kind of a voice?</p>
<p><strong>sueleen</strong>: You sure do it loud.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Is that good?</p>
<p><strong>sueleen</strong>: It’s not bad.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: You think I should take lessons?</p>
<p><strong>sueleen</strong>: If you’re serious. Being serious is real
important.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: You serious?</p>
<p><strong>sueleen</strong>: Wade – I’ve been working toward this
audition for years.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Well, honey, I sure hope it comes your way
then.</p>
<p><strong>sueleen</strong>: You think it will?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Sure thing.</p>
<p><strong>stew #1</strong>: I just knew that was you when you got
on.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: You did, huh?</p>
<p><strong>stew #1</strong>: Ya - I even recognized them.</p>
<p><strong>stew #2</strong>: How long have you been together?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Too long.</p>
<p><strong>stew #3</strong>: Is your rather really an actor?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: All his life.</p>
<p><strong>stew #3</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Me, too.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: You having any fun?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: That’s the most important thing – to have –
fun</p>
<p><strong>stew #2</strong>: How long are you going to be here?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Long enough to have fun.</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: What do you think of him?</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: Hal? Well, Hal and I have been friends for a
long time.</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: You go to school together?</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: No, we never did that</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: Oh –</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: We’re connected by a relative. One time, one
of his aunts married one of my uncles. That was a long time ago, though.
How’d you come to work for him?</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: Well, I really think he’s got a
chance.</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: You do?</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: Oh yea – There has never been a better
time for something new.</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: He ain’t really new.</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: He is to a lot of people.</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: He was a good Judge, but that was a long time
ago.</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: You know, I’ll bet you he makes it with a
majority.</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: Where are you from?</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: Southern California.</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: You always live there?</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: Spent time in Arizona. Why?</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: Well, I admire your optimism, and I just
wondered if it was regional. You ever see any movie stars?</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: I know a couple.</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: No kidding – Wait till I tell Linnea.
Who?</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: Ah… Peter Finch.</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: Peter Finch – he’s English.</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: I never heard of him. Name somebody else.</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: Ryan O’Neal.</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: You really do? ~ God – How come you know
them?</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: Oh, you meet them at parties and
stuff.</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: I’ll be damned. Boy, if you could get Ryan to
say something about Hal Phillip Walker, wouldn’t that be something?</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: Well – maybe. Let’s see what happens
here.</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: I’ll be dammed.</p>
<p><strong>opal</strong>: Have your children been deaf since birth?</p>
<p><strong>linnea</strong>: Yes – yes, they have. It was a real shock at
first, especially since my daddy’s a preacher, but Delbert and I have
been blessed by their being here.</p>
<p><strong>opal</strong>: When did you start singing?</p>
<p><strong>linnea</strong>: When I was little, in church.</p>
<p><strong>opal</strong>: Isn’t it unusual for you to be working with a
black choir?</p>
<p><strong>linnea</strong>: Yes, it is –</p>
<p><strong>opal</strong>: Well, can you tell me why?</p>
<p><strong>linnea</strong>: It just is.</p>
<p><strong>opal</strong>: How long have you been with them?</p>
<p><strong>linnea</strong>: About three years.</p>
<p><strong>opal</strong>: And before?</p>
<p><strong>linnea</strong>: Just my church and my boys. We all had to go
to school and learn hand talking. I just thank the Lord they can
see.</p>
<p><strong>opal</strong>: Do you ever do any writing?</p>
<p><strong>linnea</strong>: No, I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>opal</strong>: Are you a close friend of Haven’s?</p>
<p><strong>linnea</strong>: No, mostly his wife’s. She’s in Paris,
France, right now. My husband Delbert is real friendly with him.
Delbert’s in law. Does work for him.</p>
<p><strong>opal</strong>: Do you like him?</p>
<p><strong>linnea</strong>: He’s a member of our congregation.</p>
<p><strong>star</strong>: You got the money?</p>
<p><strong>albuquerque</strong>: Right here.</p>
<p><strong>star</strong>: Well, don’t lose it. Last time I gave you
twenty-five dollars, you lost it.</p>
<p><strong>albuquerque</strong>: Well, that just happened that time.</p>
<p><strong>star</strong>: Well, it better not happen again.</p>
<p><strong>star</strong>: You lost twenty-five dollars once before that,
too, near Christmas time – I remember that real well now. December 9th,
to be exact.</p>
<p><strong>albuquerque</strong>: You got a real good memory, Star.</p>
<p><strong>star</strong>: I remember when I just saw you. Skinny
Winnifred. Jesus, you were skinny.</p>
<p><strong>albuquerque</strong>: What do you have to buy?</p>
<p><strong>star</strong>: Feed, mostly. Thought we’d get something for
the kids.</p>
<p><strong>albuquerque</strong>: Okay by me - I’d sure like to see that
Opryland.</p>
<p><strong>star</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>albuquerque</strong>: Grand Old Opera –</p>
<p><strong>star</strong>: I hate that music.</p>
<p><strong>albuquerque</strong>: I know that, Star.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Oh, my God!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Norman, just sit there and don’t puke.</p>
<p><strong>albuquerque</strong>: Hey, mind if I walk with ya?</p>
<p><strong>albuquerque</strong>: You a musician?</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>albuquerque</strong>: Do you have people in Nashville?</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: No – Just coming to Nashville, that’s
all.</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: I don’t care. I pay you people twenty-five
bucks an hour and keep you working steady. Now either go on or turn
around. But move.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Don’t worry, Norman. There’s no blood.
Nobody’s hurt.</p>
<p><strong>albuquerque</strong>: Hurt my foot…</p>
<p><strong>star</strong>: Have you seen a woman about so high?</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>star</strong>: She had on high heels?</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>star</strong>: Need a ride?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Barbara, I’d like to talk to you and Barnett
alone.</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: Anything you say.</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: Doctor says you’ll have to go on out
now</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: Excuse me, Barnett, how’s she doing?</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: I’m sorry. I feel as if I know you. I’m
John Triplette… a friend of Del Reese… I was at the airport. I just
wanted to introduce myself. I’m a great fan of hers. If there’s anything
you need, just give me a call. I’m at the Sheraton South.</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: She’s going to rest now.</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: Okay, I just wanted to see if I could
help out at all.</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: I appreciate your concern, but she has to
rest, so you can go on home.</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: Oh, sure.</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: What do you really want?</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: Not a thing, Barnett, really. I need a
little information. But, ah, it can wait.</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: You bet.</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: Okay. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Well, it’s exhaustion, pure and simple, and
you’re going to have to take a rest or you’re going to be in big
trouble.</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: She has to be at the opera tomorrow night
and then she can go home.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: She’s not going anywhere, Barnett. This is
precisely what I’m talking about. She is collapsing. She cannot go on
without a rest or she will have to stop altogether for a long time.</p>
<p><strong>barbara jean</strong>: Well, I have to go: It’s too late to
be replaced, and, besides, I just can’t do that. Those people get
disappointed. They’ve come in from all over, you know, and this Miss
Foxy who’s been writing to me for years is going to be there from
Michigan.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: You cannot leave this bed until I say so.
The two of you have to understand that. Barnett, you’ve got to stop this
dovetailing and give her some rest. You don’t need to make that much
more money.</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: It’s not the money. The friends and
neighbors love her and they want to see her. We got a debt to the
public.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Well, they are not going to see her tomorrow
night, and I suggest you get on the phone and make the necessary
arrangements.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: We just got a gold record.</p>
<p><strong>opal</strong>: Do they have a show to give it to you?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: No Hell, some secretary in New York just hands
it to you. Only this one kept dropping it out of the box.</p>
<p><strong>opal</strong>: Did it break?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Dent it a little. Boy – just she couldn1t even
find it. She had a hamburger on her desk that looked three weeks
old.</p>
<p><strong>opal</strong>: How long have you been together?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Probably a little too long.</p>
<p><strong>opal</strong>: Do you study at all?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Depends on what I’m studying.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: When do you need her?</p>
<p><strong>delbert</strong>: Monday night.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: You want her to sing, too?</p>
<p><strong>sueleen</strong>: I can do benefits</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>delbert</strong>: Twenty dollars for her and ten for you.</p>
<p><strong>managzr</strong>: Well, do you want a blonde?</p>
<p><strong>delbert</strong>: How does she look?</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: You know… blonde.</p>
<p><strong>delbert</strong>: Okay, I’ll get you your money.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: I can only give you fifty a week here and
ten bucks for the benefit.</p>
<p><strong>sueleen</strong>: Money’s no object.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: You go here Monday night and be there at
eight sharp and look flashy you know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Are you sure you know what you’re
doing?</p>
<p><strong>sueleen</strong>: Hundreds of times.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Well, there’s a couple of girls in Printers
Alley if you got any questions. I know I’ve seen that G- string stuff
for sale someplace around.</p>
<p><strong>sueleen</strong>: Don’t you worry about Sueleen Gay.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: That’s for sure. At the airport - that’s
where it was. At the airport, there in one of those gift shops… Anyway,
you better take a break.</p>
<p><strong>sueleen</strong>: Thanks. You are just a wonderful
person.</p>
<p><strong>linnea</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Linnea?</p>
<p><strong>linnea</strong>: Yes. Who’s this?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>linnea</strong>: Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Tom. You remember?</p>
<p><strong>linnea</strong>: I’m not sure. Where?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Remember, about a month ago, your church choir
cut a record?</p>
<p><strong>linnea</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Well, I met you that afternoon in the control
room and we…</p>
<p><strong>linnea</strong>: Oh, Tom, of course. What are you doing in
Nashville?</p>
<p><strong>t0m</strong>: Cutting a record.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I’d really like to see you.</p>
<p><strong>linnea</strong>: Or course. You should come over to the
house. The boys would love to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: That’s not quite what I had in mind.</p>
<p><strong>linnea</strong>: Well…How have you been?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Well, they removed my heart last week, but I’m
doing fine except my nose fell off. Looks a little funny.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Look, I find you attractive and I want to see
you, so I’ll call you when I get to my place.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Hey, what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>albuquerque</strong>: Just fixing this strap here</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I know what you’re doing. I’ve done it too
long not to know. But if you’re going to hunt down food, get enough so
you won’t have to do it again right away. Peanut butter’s good. Man can
last a long time on peanut butter.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Tommy Brown, you are the whitest nigger I have
ever seen.</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: Let’s go –</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I don’t think Norman’s done yet.</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: We’ve heard enough. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Hell, you’re whiter than that old boy up
there.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Where the hell are you going, Oreo cookie?</p>
<p><strong>star</strong>: Hey, there - You seen my Winifred?</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>star</strong>: You got a place to stay?</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: No. Probably stay at a motel tonight.</p>
<p><strong>star</strong>: You in music?</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>star</strong>: Get in.</p>
<p><strong>l.a. joan</strong>: I hope he’s still here. I don’t know
where he lives.</p>
<p><strong>green</strong>: You should have stayed. Ester’s been wanting
to see you.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>opal</strong>: Come on back to bed.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Yeah, you bet. You’re really terrific. You know
what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>opal</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Just a minute.</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Hiya. Listen, is Linnea there?</p>
<p><strong>linnea</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Listen, 1’m sorry I didn’t call a little
sooner. I sorta got tied up. Listen…</p>
<p><strong>linnea</strong>: Who is thin?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Who is this? It’s Tom.</p>
<p><strong>linnea</strong>: I don’t know who you are.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: What do you mean? You said you wanted to see
me.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: What the hell is going on?</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I would like to talk to…</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: You call again and I’m calling the
police.</p>
<p><strong>74 ext. rooming house - morning</strong>: KENNY stands on the
front porch or one of the many rooming houses near Music Row. GREEN
opens the front door. He is with his dog. We HEAR L.A. JOAN SINGING from
another room.</p>
<p><strong>green</strong>: Yes, air.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>green</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: Yes, sir. I need a room</p>
<p><strong>green</strong>: I think we can do that. Come in.</p>
<p><strong>green</strong>: Green’s the name.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: Kenneth Fraser. Glad to meet you…</p>
<p><strong>green</strong>: My wire’s been in the hospital so things
might be a little dusty, but the sheets are clean and the bath’s down
the hall. You’re in music, I guess, aren’t you? ’Cause my niece sings
most of the day. That won’t bother you, will it?</p>
<p><strong>green</strong>: I didn’t think it would. She’s calling
herself L.A. Joan this- week. Last week it was Dakota. Guess if you have
to change your name a state’s as good as anything.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: She sure sings nice.</p>
<p><strong>green</strong>: My wife and I think so, but we’re family.
Your family’s always good or bad depending on how you look at your
family. What do you do, pick or sing?</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: Oh… a little of both. Just thought I’d look
around at Nashville for a while.</p>
<p><strong>green</strong>: When you run out or money, ’cause you will
here, you can go sing at Bishop’s Pub. They let you pass the hat. All
these kids do that. Most every place doesn’t want to bother with
you.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: I’m not really a musician.</p>
<p><strong>green</strong>: Well, don’t be shy. I got the address here.
Anytime you need it. Room’s twenty-five dollar! a week and you can have
breakfast with me if you like.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: Suits me.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: Listen, do you know anything about cars?</p>
<p><strong>green</strong>: A little. What do you need?</p>
<p><strong>green</strong>: Get ready. We’re going to the hospital.</p>
<p><strong>green</strong>: we’re going.</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: You’ll have to stand closer to the
mike.</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: You’ve only got time for one more take,
unless you’ve got another twenty-five dollar!.</p>
<p><strong>albuquerque</strong>: Oh, don’t you worry. You sure done your
best. It’ll be fine. I just know it.</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: Okay, you’re on.</p>
<p><strong>albuquerque</strong>: Hi… This here is Albuquerque speaking.
You don’t know me yet but ya will after I sing you this song that I’ve
wrote called…</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: Okay, come in the booth. You’ll have to
wait for the disc.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: HI. Look at those flowers. Did you grow
those.</p>
<p><strong>green</strong>: Ester and me did; My niece picked then. She’s
just here from California.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: That’s good, I’ve never seen anything so
healthy.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: You sit there for a moment and let me see if
she’s sleeping.</p>
<p><strong>green</strong>: Excuse me. Are you in music?</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>green</strong>: Well, neither am I. But my niece is.</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: Wake up. You’ll sleep the day away.</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: I called Connie and she said not to worry,
She’ll fill in for you.</p>
<p><strong>barbara jean</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Sorry I’m late.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You’re not.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Where’s Bill?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Sleeping.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Out.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: He got killed at a turkey shoot.</p>
<p><strong>opal</strong>: Your brother?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Yes. I was in my Sophomore year at Harvard.</p>
<p><strong>opal</strong>: Harvard?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Business School so I can run Haven’s
business.</p>
<p><strong>opal</strong>: What is a turkey shoot.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: You go out in the woods and shoot targets –
Whoever shoots the most wins a live turkey</p>
<p><strong>opal</strong>: How in the world did he get shot?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Some guy was drunk and hit him. Accident. Haven
almost killed him.</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: Sorry to bother you, Bud.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Yes, sir. Like you to meet Opal.</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: Need to have you check these out before he
goes on that Walker benefit.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Sure thing. Put them here… I’ll take them.</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: Thanks… I’ll… go say hello to your mom.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: She’s in Paris.</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: Oh… Well… Have you heard from Barnett?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: Let me know when you do, all right?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: You bet.</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: I’ll just be in here.</p>
<p><strong>opal</strong>: Do you know Barbara Jean?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Sure do. Good friend of Haven’s.</p>
<p><strong>opal</strong>: Haven’s not going to talk to me.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Sure he will.</p>
<p><strong>opal</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>opal</strong>: I’m Opal.</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: Oh yes, I’m John Triplette.</p>
<p><strong>opal</strong>: I’m gathering information about the
characteristics of music people. I just finished a documentary on
Gandi.</p>
<p><strong>opal</strong>: The architect His buildings are drippy. You
know, like sand and castles. Then I got this assignment. They want to
start in two weeks.</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>opal</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>opal</strong>: What? Oh. A film.</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: Where’d you get the cake?</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: Someone gave it… Here, you want this…
I’ll…</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: A little worried. Fine, though.</p>
<p><strong>announcer’s voice</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen, Haven
Hamilton.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: We want to send special wishes to Barbara
Jean who is in the Baptist Hospital. She collapsed yesterday morning at
the plane christening. Send your prayers and letters to Baptist
Hospital, Nashville, Tennessee. Barnett said she wept because she
couldn’t be here with you friends and neighbors. But your faith in the
great Almighty will bring her back here just to be what you want her to
be… And her good friend, Connie White, has given up some time with her
own mother, who is sick with a kidney disorder, to fill in and send her
warmth to you wonderful friends and neighbors so you won’t be too
disappointed after this message from teeth-sticken, good, gooey
clusters.</p>
<p><strong>albuquerque</strong>: I know it’s here somewhere. I had it
when I walked in, but you weren’t here. My name’s Albuquerque, and I’m
here cutting a record. My people said it would be all right.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Sorry, miss. No pass, no entrance. Your
people should have given you a pass.</p>
<p><strong>albuquerque</strong>: They did. I know I’ll find it here.</p>
<p><strong>albuquerque</strong>: Sister Connie… Connie. Hi, I saw you
out there. I just think you’re so beautiful. What do you think? I can’t
find my pass. I’m here cutting a record, you know, and these policemen
here…</p>
<p><strong>connie</strong>: I’m so glad you come for a little while, and
thank you.</p>
<p><strong>albuquerque</strong>: I could just sit where I was. I wasn’t
bothering anybody. That guy asking everybody questions made more noise
than I ever did. You saw me there. You signed this program.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Miss Connie, you’re next.</p>
<p><strong>connie</strong>: Oh, honey, I gotta go. Thanks for coming.
You read what I wrote you now.</p>
<p><strong>albuquerque</strong>: I did. You said, ‘your friend,
Connie.’</p>
<p><strong>barbara jean</strong>: Would you turn that off</p>
<p><strong>barbara jean</strong>: Barnett, please -</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: What’s wrong honey.</p>
<p><strong>barbara jean</strong>: I don’t want to listen to her sing
-</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: Don’t feel that way, honey.</p>
<p><strong>barbara jean</strong>: Then why are you listening to her
-</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: Well, I have to go thank her for filling in
and it’s nice to know the tune she sang.</p>
<p><strong>barbara jean</strong>: You have to what?</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: Go to the King Of the Road and thank
her.</p>
<p><strong>barbara jean</strong>: Well here, why don’t you take her some
of these flowers while you’re at it.</p>
<p><strong>barbara jean</strong>: Maybe you’d like to work out something
with her, too… Split us up… Her on the road and me in town or in the
hospital – Barnett!</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: What the hell is wrong with you? Huh?</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: Wait a minute. You’re not going nutsey on
me, are you? Huh…? You’re not going to have one of those nervous
breakdowns or anything, are you?</p>
<p><strong>barbara jean</strong>: A… No… No, I’m just… I’m really fine…
I just. don’t want you to think I’m giving up or anything like that…</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: I’ll just take these on over to her. Show
her your appreciation.</p>
<p><strong>barbara jean</strong>: Sure… you go on and do that.</p>
<p><strong>barbara jean</strong>: Barnett?</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: I’ll tell her thank you, for you.</p>
<p><strong>barbara jean</strong>: Barnett?</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>barbara jean</strong>: Bye, bye.</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: Bye. bye.</p>
<p><strong>barbara jean</strong>: I just get so afraid sometimes. Then I
get more afraid. : Just want you to hold me.</p>
<p><strong>green</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>green</strong>: Am I disturbing you?</p>
<p><strong>barbara jean</strong>: I’m really all right, Barnett. Don’t
you worry really… I just don’t want you to leave me that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>barbara jean</strong>: Oh, my God.</p>
<p><strong>green</strong>: Oh, honey, I didn’t mean to scare you.</p>
<p><strong>barbara jean</strong>: How did you come in here?</p>
<p><strong>green</strong>: Well, my wife, Ester’s down the hall. I saw
Barnett leaving and I was just talking to Ester about your being here.
She loves you so much, I just had to come down and say hello. We’ve been
following you since you were a girl. Well, I just scared you to death. I
didn’t mean to do that.</p>
<p><strong>barbara jean</strong>: Well, I guess you caught me at a weak
moment.</p>
<p><strong>green</strong>: You’ll have to speak up.</p>
<p><strong>barbara jean</strong>: I said, I’ve been real tired.</p>
<p><strong>green</strong>: Eater says she doesn’t see how you do it.</p>
<p><strong>barbara jean</strong>: What’s wrong with her.</p>
<p><strong>green</strong>: Oh just about everything, I guess. Those
doctors started on an overhaul and don’t want to quit. They keep taking
things out. She’s going to come home an egg shell. Tough, though.. She’s
tough.</p>
<p><strong>barbara jean</strong>: What did you say your name was?</p>
<p><strong>green</strong>: Green.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Well, Mr. Green.</p>
<p><strong>green</strong>: Hi, Sherry.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: How’d you get in here.</p>
<p><strong>barbara jean</strong>: It’s fine. We were just talking about
Vitamin S.</p>
<p><strong>green</strong>: I’ll go on. Ester’1l be very glad.</p>
<p><strong>barbara jean</strong>: You remember what I said about the
Vitamins.</p>

<p><strong>bill</strong>: You know goddamn well where she is.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Bastard</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Stop it!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Tom!</p>
<p><strong>triplette’s voice</strong>: No, ah, Bill?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>triplette’s voice</strong>: I’m with ABC-TV. Like to come up
and talk to you for a minute if I could.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: Hi. I’m John Triplette.</p>

<p><strong>mary</strong>: Oh, no.</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: He’s pretty well known down here.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: He’s pretty well known all over.</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: I was wondering if you’d like to be in
it. It’s going to be televised and…</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: What’s he running for?</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: President.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: President?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: When is it?</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: Wednesday at the park. We’ve got a lot of
names coming in…</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: For him?</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Well, we can’t. We’re registered
Democrats.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: National television?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: Minimum.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: We can’t support him We’re registered
Democrats.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: It’s an appearance. It has nothing to do with
support. I don’t even like him.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Bill, he’s a crazy man.</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: Well, he- expressed a particular wish to
have you on.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: You’re real favorites of his.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You’re kidding.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: How come?</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: First you have to understand how much he
admires you.</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: You sing for people and that’s what he’s
about. He wants to help people. Especially now, you know.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Where’d he ever see us?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: D.C.? Tammany Hall? He came there?</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: Sure thing.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What National TV…?</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: You’re doing some recording here, aren’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: An album.</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: Might be good for you.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: We’ll sing.</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: You don’t know how pleased he’ll be.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Come on in.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: How’s your stomach?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Pretty good. Sure was surprised to hear from
you. You talk to Bill?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Not yet. Listen, Norman, I want…</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: They’re looking all over for you. Do you
have a copy of the album.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: You know Bill is really mad at you.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Oh?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: I mean…</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Mary?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: You know, I’ve got my own act now. I’m going

<p><strong>tom</strong>: Good…</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Listen, Tom, I have a tour to drive.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: Mom?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: I’ve been so worried, dear. where are
you?</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: Nashville.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Oh… Well.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: The car broke down.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Oh, well, I knew that before you- even left.
I told you, ‘Kenny, that old Nash won’t make it down the road.’ But you
had to go.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: Well, I got to Nashville. That’s pretty
far.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Next you’ll be sick.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: I feel really good.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: How are you going to pay when you get
sick?</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: I’m in a rooming house with Mr. Green.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Green? Not Owen Green. Owen Green embezzled
money from your grandfather</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: I don’t know his first name.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Bet the sheets are grey.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: No. No, they’re white. He’s got a nice
dog.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Worst time at year for dogs is when they get
fungus.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: Fungus?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: He doesn1t have fungus, does he?</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Well, you’ll get it, skin as sensitive as
yours.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: How do you know if they do?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Weather’s been awful. All those bombs
dropping. It changes our weather. Sure not like the good old days.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: Does their hair fall out?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Your hair fell out? Just like your father.
Weak hair.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: Listen. Maybe I should go…</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: I’ve been a Little dyspeptic.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: I want to get the dog off my bed.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: But, I’ll take some of that Nyquil… you know
it puts you right to sleep no matter what’s wrong, you go right off…</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: Okay. I’ll be talking to you.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Keep warm, dear. Let me hear from you.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: Bye.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Bye.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: I have to try to get my car running.</p>
<p><strong>l.a. joan</strong>: I’ll go with you.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: Well, okay…</p>
<p><strong>linnea</strong>: This your first time?</p>
<p><strong>linnea</strong>: You’re from out of town?</p>
<p><strong>albuquerque</strong>: Yes. I’m cutting a record.</p>
<p><strong>linnea</strong>: We have a Bible study meeting tonight if
you’d like to come.</p>
<p><strong>albuquerque</strong>: Is there food?</p>
<p><strong>linnea</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>albuquerque</strong>: Well, I just wondered ’cause being from
out or town I wouldn’t be able to make anything.</p>
<p><strong>linnea</strong>: No, those are socials you’re thinking of…
Saturday’s usually.</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: This is your first time, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>albuquerque</strong>: Yes sir. I’m from Tallahassee.</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>albuquerque</strong>: And I want you to know I round Jesus
today, right here.</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: Bless you. I hope we see you again,
then.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Now in the cemetery Roy already has his
stone, it’s a fiddle… right as you drive in you can see it in front
there.</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: Oh?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Lot of them do. Fans start chipping at them,
though…. Johnny cash has a $100,000 fence around his house. Well, the
fans are stealing the rocks right out of it. Haven Hamilton has a
$700,000 fence. It has spikes.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: That house over there is where I live. The
one with the red truck. My aunt drives the school bus. 600 kids a
day.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Some black folks wanted to paint this car
once. I didn’t let them. They also wanted me to kiss the bride. I
declined.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: In the city of Nashville, there are a total
of hundred and twenty millionaires some of them inhabit these beautiful
home sites to make Nashville known as the Athens of the South. Here on
the right you see the home of Haven Hamilton’s mother. He built it for
her after his Daddy passed away three years ago of lung cancer. Haven
contributes time and money to the cancer foundation, now. You can see
some of his records handing there in the living room.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Look, now you can see it.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: He got that one in 1962. Song called ‘Smokey
Heart.’</p>
<p><strong>opal</strong>: You weren’t really going to drive off?</p>
<p><strong>opal</strong>: My name’s Opal. What’s yours?</p>
<p><strong>opal</strong>: You going to Nashville?</p>
<p><strong>opal</strong>: Good. I came out here to meet some underground
singer. They say she only writes in those trees over there.</p>
<p><strong>opal</strong>: She never came. I’m trying to gather some
information about the characteristics of music people for English
television. I started in San Francisco. Some friends were making an
anti-war film about ’Nam, you know, and I just love marine movies. It is
really the consummate art form, all those parts of the puzzle to make
the whole. All that energy being collective, you know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>opal</strong>: I’ve been all over the United States now
except for Maine and Vermont.</p>
<p><strong>opal</strong>: What did you say your name was?</p>
<p><strong>star</strong>: Star.</p>
<p><strong>opal</strong>: Star - oh! that’s a fantastic name. Almost as
good as Opal. I changed my name in Taos. This man that was really into
low budget movies said my eyes were opalistic.</p>
<p><strong>opal</strong>: I’m going to make the consummate documentary
as soon as I finish gathering information. You know it’s so nice not to
feel oppressed in a society that is male oriented.</p>
<p><strong>star</strong>: Are you in music?</p>
<p><strong>opal</strong>: No, I told you that.</p>

<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Didn’t you get?… How are you?</p>
<p><strong>green</strong>: I’m fine. Can I go up?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Let me see if I can get the doctor hold on
one second.</p>
<p><strong>green</strong>: You want me to wait?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: No. Mr. Green, I don’t know how to tell you
this – your wire passed away – I thought they’d called you at home.</p>
<p><strong>green</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Your wire Ester - she passed away.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: If you’ll wait Just a minute I’ll get
everything from the business office.</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: My mamma used to know her… They lived next
door to each other… she said she was always nursing the sick
animals.</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: I really learned all about her from my Momma
– She’s been saving this scrap book about her since she got to be
famous.</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: The one thing she said to me when I joined
was "When you’re doing your travels you be sure you see Barbara Jean.
You don’t have to say anything about me but you be sure you see her." So
that’s what I’ve been doing. Now I’m going to hitch a ride so I can see
her in Memphis.</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: You give my test to your wife1</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Mr. Green, the doctor is on his way and the
business office has your bill ready.</p>
<p><strong>linnea</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Wow!</p>
<p><strong>linnea</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Who is this, right? I called you last
night.</p>
<p><strong>linnea</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I’ve got a gig tonight.</p>
<p><strong>linnea</strong>: Oh?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: End of Church Street. Next to a grocery
store.</p>
<p><strong>linnea</strong>: Doesn’t it have a name?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I can’t remember. In out/out in, something like
that. Around eight.</p>
<p><strong>sueleen</strong>: Hi, I’m Sueleen Gay.</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: I’m John Triplette. Excuse me. I got all
caught up in looking at you. You’ll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>sueleen</strong>: Oh, why thank you.</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: May I see your costume?</p>
<p><strong>sueleen</strong>: You like it? Listen, where is the pianist?
I need to go over this with him.</p>
<p><strong>sueleen</strong>: You all didn’t say what you wanted to
hear.</p>
<p><strong>sueleen</strong>: Someday I’m gonna be a star like Barbara
Jean.</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: Sueleen, you’re prettier and probably
sing better. Besides, she is unusually sick. And tonight you have the
opportunity to work in front of some grateful gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: Have you ever done this before?</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: Well, it’s not too hard. You’ll sing
whatever it is you want to sing. They’ll applaud like crazy ’cause I can
tell them that you’re really something and then the piano and drum will
give you a little fanfare and you can sing and take off your clothes or
not sing. It really doesn’t make much difference, really. But since
you’ve never done this before, singing might help.</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: Now this is to raise funds for someone
who can help people who are less fortunate than yourself. The more you
take off, you see, more money we can raise.</p>
<p><strong>sueleen</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: I know that you are an artist and I am
sure you are very religious.</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: Well, this is for people who have a kind
of religious belief in the way they live.</p>
<p><strong>sueleen</strong>: Don’t you think they’d just love another
song instead?</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: Now, Sueleen, you know that’s not what we
talked about right here in this very room.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: We’re ready to striiippppp… for cash,
gentlemen. The time has come to dig deep. Our little Sueleen in going to
dig deep for you.</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: Here we are, Sueleen.</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: Sueleen… Sueleen Gay.</p>
<p><strong>sueleen</strong>: Oh, no.</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: Wait a minute! I want to look at you.
C’mon.</p>
<p><strong>sueleen</strong>: Oh, please, Oh, God.</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: C’mon! I Just wanna look…</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: Good. I wanna look really good. You know what
I mean? Do you? Huh?</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>sueleen</strong>: It’ll be okay… It’ll be okay… I know it’ll
be fine…</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I was in prison for twenty-eight years.</p>
<p><strong>linnea</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Premeditated murder.</p>
<p><strong>linnea</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Just got out. Had me thirteen lawyers. Missed
the electric chair twice. .. Been out three months. Are you heavy?</p>
<p><strong>linnea</strong>: I’m not sure…</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I’m forty-six. Do you like to go up or
down?</p>
<p><strong>linnea</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: High? Do you ever get high? A walk on the wild
side. Ever do dust?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: All I need is fifteen minutes a night.</p>
<p><strong>linnea</strong>: Fifteen minutes?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Sleep. That’s all I need. Don’t want to waste
no time sleeping. You married?</p>
<p><strong>linnea</strong>: What…? 0h, yes.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Not me. Ain’t never loved anybody. Ain’t never
been married. Won’t either.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Good evening. Thanks. I used to be part of a
group. You remember?</p>
<p><strong>ton</strong>: Well, they’re here, Bill and Mary. We’re
cutting a record here. So far, they’ve done all the work. It’s an
accident they’re here. I’ve been hiding from them for days now,
right?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You bet your sweet ass.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: You know who that is?</p>
<p><strong>linnea</strong>: Yea.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I’d like to sing a new song for you. I threw
away a good one I wrote yesterday. maybe it was the day before –
anyway.. Let’s go here, ‘I’m Easy.’</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Love, that’s a word that’s been overused. I’ll
say I sure like you. Maybe…</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Listen, we’re suppose to sing on TV day after
tomorrow. At the park…</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: National?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Yes. Percy Warner Park’.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Where are you staying?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Is that for that Walker guy?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Yes, but we’re just singing.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Sue was trying to get hold of you.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Come on. He’s a crook.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: What crook?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I’m a Roman Catholic. You’re Baptist, I bet.
Catholic means universal, everything, know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I’m a scholar of the Bible as well and we’re
all going to answer to God. Have you read the book of Revelations?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: You ever read the ‘Apocalypse Unsealed?’</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I’m not coming anywhere near that place. He’s a
rotten guy.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: That’s not true.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: He’s a politician.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: He saw us at Tammany Hall.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: The Hell he did. Look, I’ll see you in the
morning.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: You bet. Nine, right? But count me out of that
other thing.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: My mother. died in ’72. They told me after.
They said they couldn’t find me before, so they told us after.</p>
<p><strong>linnea</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: They said go see the chaplain.</p>
<p><strong>linnea</strong>: I’m sorry but I have to go.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I’m a hundred years old and when I’m two
hundred, I’ll die.</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: Well, for heaven’s sake. You’re just about
everywhere, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>thiplette</strong>: I came out to see how you all were
doing.</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: I think I should tell you I know why you’re
here. The answer is no … we don’t get involved in politics.</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: Well, that’s not entirely true, Barnett.
At least not according to Haven.</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: Haven? Hell,’ we’ve been playing poker
together since we were fourteen.</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: I guess that’s why he thought you right
want to help out.</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: He knows better.</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: Well, it’s probably because it would help
him.</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: How is that?</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: Everybody likes to be as good as their
word.</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: Whose word?</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: His Word.</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: His word? Are you telling me Haven promised
you something?</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: That’s pretty close. He’s going to be on
the bill. Why not put Barbara Jean on with him?</p>
<p><strong>barbara jean</strong>: Barnett..</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: Get her feet up.</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: Okay, honey.</p>
<p><strong>barbara jean</strong>: Oh, Barnett, I’m so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: Honey, it’s okay… How do you feel now?</p>
<p><strong>barbara jean</strong>: All those people…</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: Don’t worry, I’ll take care or it</p>
<p><strong>barbara jean</strong>: You’re so good.</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: She’s fine now, folks. Just too soon after
the hospital, I guess. She won’t be able to continue and she’s in the
bus crying her eyes out, because she doesn’t want to disappoint the
people who love her the most.</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: Come on, come on. You don’t want to waste
your energy on that fool.</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: She’s frail. You never saw anybody so frail.
I’ve seen her breathe hard just standing still, dammit. You’re selfish.
Worst selfish I’ve ever heard. What if she died? Would you like that?
You’d probably say she faked it so they could make money. Well, you’re
just dumb.</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: We could invite them to the park.</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: They can come to the concert in the
park.</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: I said ‘no!’</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: We’re very Sorry… Please… If you’ll listen.
You can see her tomorrow at Percy Warner Park…</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: Triplette, I want to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: I got trapped and you know it, so let’s
have some rules.</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: Absolutely. Listen, Barnett, I understand
your position.</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: No, you don’t, so don’t say you do. Bunch
of damn liars. What do you get out or this?</p>
<p><strong>triplette</strong>: Nothing; Barnett. It’s my job.</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: Your job, huh.</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: She will not appear on the stage or support
that Walker guy and you can’t have any of his signs up while she sings.
She’ll be on first and out of the park before he shows up. There will be
no pictures, no questions, no answers or tying her name up with his now
or in the future to come. Any money she makes will go to the President
of the United States.</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: We’ll see you tomorrow. I’ll send her three
songs over this afternoon. She’ll be done about ten minutes after she
starts and Walker better not show up till she’s through. Now, get out of
here.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Barnett?</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Well, Barnett, I have this terrific song I’ve
been working on. It would be a natural for Barbara Jean. Like you to
take a look at it.</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: I’m very busy right now. Get me Haven.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: It’ll just take a minute. Here, I’ll even hold
it for you.</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: I don’t know where you got this, but
something tells me you stole it and I hate thieves.</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: Aren’t you an engineer…? I know you – Don’t
you work at one of those cut a record places…? Twenty-five bucks a shot,
isn’t it? Usually their last twenty-five…</p>
<p><strong>mc</strong>: Thank you, Mr. Berguan. And now we bring you,
