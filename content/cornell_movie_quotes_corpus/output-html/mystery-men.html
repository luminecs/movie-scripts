<h1 id="mystery-men">mystery-men</h1>
<p><strong>bierce</strong>: No one can deny the horrendous nature of
Mr. Frankenstein’s crimes, but in the twenty years he has been with us,
I have never seen a patient turn his energies to more productive
use.</p>
<p><strong>bierce</strong>: Just look at his accomplishments… three
volumes of poetry, two rock operas, a sculpture garden, four romance
novels… and who can forget his touching portrayal of Billy Bigelow in
our all-psychotic production of “Carousel”…</p>
<p><strong>bierce</strong>: Directed by our own Doctor Anabel Leek.</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: Twenty years ago I was a lost soul.
Loveless… Fatherless… A… psycho! Oh! How could I have done it? The
murder… the mayhem… all of those lovely young girls! I’m sorry! I’m SO
SO SORRY!</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: But my deeds have been done, and my youth
is gone, and we can only go forward in this cruel world… and if I have
learned anything from my wretched life it is that… When you walk through
a storm, keep your head held high… And don’t be afraid of the dark…</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: Boom.</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: Those gas leaks can be murder.</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: I’m home.</p>
<p><strong>red eye 1</strong>: Golf anyone?</p>
<p><strong>red eye 2</strong>: Not a bad night’s work.</p>
<p><strong>big red</strong>: Who said crime don’t pay?</p>
<p><strong>red eye 3</strong>: Hey, Boss, we got a stowaway.</p>
<p><strong>red eye 4</strong>: Who you laughin’ at, punk?</p>
<p><strong>red eye 2</strong>: He’s just a tyke. Lighten up.</p>
<p><strong>red eye 5</strong>: He’s kinda cute.</p>
<p><strong>red eye 3</strong>: If you like drool.</p>
<p><strong>red eye 2</strong>: Hey, why don’t we sell him back to his
parents? For a million bucks!</p>
<p><strong>big red</strong>: And what if he rats on us?</p>
<p><strong>red eye 3</strong>: So what should we do with him?</p>
<p><strong>big red</strong>: Stick a brick in his Pampers and dump him
in the lake.</p>
<p><strong>red eye 3</strong>: Come on, kid, you’re goin’ for a
swim.</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: Not so fast, gentlemen–and I use the term
loosely… Unhand that youngster…</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: Or you’re mulch.</p>
<p><strong>big red</strong>: What are you guys supposed to be…
superheroes?</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: We ARE superheroes!</p>
<p><strong>big red</strong>: Really? Did you mother make those
costumes?</p>
<p><strong>big red</strong>: This is our territory. Beat it.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Over YOUR dead body.</p>
<p><strong>big red</strong>: 0ooooo, he’s scary.</p>
<p><strong>big red</strong>: A fork!</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: And there’s plenty more where that came
from.</p>
<p><strong>red eyes</strong>: Crush him, Mikey!… Mash him!… Mush
him!</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Is that all you got?</p>
<p><strong>red eyes</strong>: He wants more!… Squish him!… Finish him
off!</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Your mother!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Is there a problem?</p>
<p><strong>red eyes</strong>: We give!… We’re sorry!… We had terrible
childhoods!</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: Nice work, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>amazing</strong>: Hi. Dawn.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Looks like you’ve done it again, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>amazing</strong>: It’s what I do.</p>
<p><strong>cop 1</strong>: Okay, show’s over. Move it. On your way.</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: Wait a minute, Officers. You don’t understand–
we’re superheroes, and we just busted up this gang.</p>
<p><strong>cop 1</strong>: Really? Let me guess-you’re Towel Head and
he’s… Captain Pooper Scooper!</p>
<p><strong>cop 1</strong>: Hey! Move it!</p>
<p><strong>cop 2</strong>: Get a life!</p>
<p><strong>cop 1</strong>: And leave crime fighting to the real
thing!</p>
<p><strong>cop 1</strong>: Wannabes.</p>
<p><strong>cop 2</strong>: Pathetic.</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: He doesn’t miss a trick, does he?</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: What a jerk–and like nobody knows who he
really is!</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: Oh don’t start that again–</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: He’s Lance Hunt! Just take off the glasses–
and it’s him!</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: There’s a vague similarity.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: A vague similarity? IT’S THE SAME GUY!</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: 0h, who gives a damn who he is? I can’t
take this anymore. Night after night we’re on the streets, busting our
humps–and for what?</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: We take the licks and he gets the chicks.</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: How long do you have to chase a dream
before you realize it’s not gonna happen?</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: We need a break, that’s all! Nobody’d ever
heard of him until he busted Casanova Frankenstein!</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: But look at him… and look at us.</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: The camera loves him.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Why do they always fill stuff these things
so full you can’t pull ’em out without ripping ’em!</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: I lost another fork tonight. She’s getting
suspicious, I know it.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: So why don’t you just tell her!</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: Because I can’t! Okay? She wouldn’t
understand!</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: Leave him alone. She’s his mother, not
yours.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: We had an off night, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: So when are we gonna have an on night?</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: You’re… new.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: It’s my first night. My name’s Monica.</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: You guys going to a costume party?</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: We’re superheroes.</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: Really? Like Captain Amazing?</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: Are you famous?</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: So you’re like… struggling superheroes?</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: We prefer to think of ourselves as unsung… I
am the Blue Raja, Master of Silverware… little flipping thing with</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: And these are my associatiates, the
Shoveler.</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: And Mister Furious… His anger is his
power.</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: Usually a superpower is a magical endowment or
a great skill. In his case, it’s entirely emotional.</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: So what can I get you?</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: Burgers all around. Medium. Rare. Raw.</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: She likes you.</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: Definitely.</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: Ask her out.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Nah.</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: Roy, when was the last time you had an actual
date?</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: What does it matter? Women just want to
control you–and talk about their feelings. They want to know why you’re
angry all the time–and what can they can do to help–so you tell them
there’s nothing–nothing–just leave me alone–but they bug you and they
bug you and they bug you–until you just can’t stand it anymore!–so you
finally open up–you pop like a blister–and it all comes spewing out–all
your emotions–your feelings–your fears–all of it! And then they dump
you.</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: So you’re chicken?</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Who’s chicken?</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Doesn’t it piss you off the way the when
you really want to talk to somebody you can’t think of anything to
say!</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: I guess… Are you always so angry?</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Only when I’m awake… You busy after
work?</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Want to go out and get drunk?</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Or talk?</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: Not tonight.</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: Maybe you should try a more romantic
approach.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Like what? Cutting off my own ear?</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: Or flowers.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: See ya tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: Hey, when are you guys gonna clean this
place up?</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: When you’re on TV.</p>
<p><strong>eddie jr.</strong>: Right–like that will ever happen.</p>
<p><strong>lenore</strong>: Save any babies lately?</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Faster than a speeding turtle–</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: More powerful than a deodorant–</p>
<p><strong>eddie jr.</strong>: Able to eat twelve donuts in a single
sitting–</p>
<p><strong>lenore</strong>: Look, snoring in his chair–</p>
<p><strong>eddie jr.</strong>: Sitting on the john–</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: It’s… Supergut!</p>
<p><strong>lucille</strong>: Rough night, Eddie?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Jeffrey!</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: Oh hi, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: What are you doing in the silver drawer?</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: Looking for… the TV Guide.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: It’s on the television.</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: Of course. I’m such a fool… Thanks, Mummy. Go
to bed.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Amazing? What’s so amazing about him? I’d
be amazing, too, if I’d inherited two hundred million bucks… or two
bucks… or two cents… Who am I kidding? Dreams don’t come true.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Where’s he going?</p>
<p><strong>amazing</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: I hope you enjoy these cigars. I had to
kill a dozen Cubans to get them.</p>
<p><strong>tony p</strong>: Ummm.</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: Have you considered my offer?</p>
<p><strong>tony p</strong>: You know, Mr. F, me and the boys always
loved workin’ for you. You had such style: the clothes, the dancin’, the
elegant way you’d snuff a babe. You were the King…</p>
<p><strong>tony p</strong>: But times have changed, and you been in that
bug house a long tine. I can see you still got the style, but I dunno
for sure you still got the edge.</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: I got it.</p>
<p><strong>tony p</strong>: What about Captain Amazing?</p>
<p><strong>amazing</strong>: Good question.</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: I knew you’d cone. I left that skylight
open for you.</p>
<p><strong>amazing</strong>: I know you did.</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: I knew you’d know.</p>
<p><strong>amazing</strong>: I know you knew I’d know.</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: But did you know I knew you’d know I’d
know?</p>
<p><strong>amazing</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>amazing</strong>: I’d hate to waste a good bullet on a piece
of scum like you, Tony.</p>
<p><strong>amazing</strong>: The jig is up, Casanova. I’ve spent six
months watching you, and know exactly what you’re up to.</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>amazing</strong>: I know that you’re recruiting your old
henchmen…</p>
<p><strong>amazing</strong>: I know who your girlfriend really is…</p>
<p><strong>amazing</strong>: And I know the terrible revenge that you
plan to inflict on this city.</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: I guess you know just about everything,
don’t you, Lance?</p>
<p><strong>amazing</strong>: Um-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: Except for one little thing.</p>
<p><strong>amazing</strong>: And what’s that?</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: That I’ve hot wired the city’s entire
power supply through that catwalk.</p>
<p><strong>amazing</strong>: What–?</p>
<p><strong>boss</strong>: YO! CAPTAIN SOMINEX! Get your shut-eye at
home, or you’ll be a full time superhero!</p>
<p><strong>anthony</strong>: It’s all within your power. The only thing
that’s in your way is YOU!</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: Easy for you to say.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Hey, Roy!</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: How many times I gotta tell you about
this?</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Sally, that’s a Herkimer Battle Jitney!
They don’t make ’em like that anymore. It’s a classic!</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: It’s a hunk of junk. I want the iron. Do
it!</p>
<p><strong>radio announcer</strong>: …and continues to deny any
knowledge of the incident… In local news, millionaire Lance Hunt has
apparently disappeared…</p>
<p><strong>radio announcer</strong>: Members at his household told
police that the playboy philanthropist failed to return home last night
after “going out for a walk”. Police say they have no reason yet to
suspect foul play, but a search is under way…</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: I saw him go in–and he didn’t come out!</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: But we don’t know for sure it’s the same
guy.</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: Hey, look.</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: Well, Don, I’ve done some terrible things
in my life, but now I’m cured, and I just want to give back something to
my old home town… That’s why I’m using what’s left of my fortune to
build…</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: The Frankenstein Center for the Arts.</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: You’ve changed, haven’t you?</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: Oh yes.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: No he hasn’t.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: Wait!… Look!</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: This is bad.</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: Who are they?</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: The Disco Boys.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: The who?</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: The most vicious gang of thugs this city ever
produced. Twenty years ago they were Casanova’s personal bodyguard. But
after he was busted they crawled into the woodwork.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Well they’ve crawled back out.</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: We may be getting in over our heads
here.</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: This looks like a job for Superman–</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: Or Batman–</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: Or both.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Don’t you guys get it? If Captain Amazing
is still in there, we can rescue him–and get on</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: Everything’s going exactly as we
planned.</p>
<p><strong>anabel</strong>: Not quite. You haven’t announced our
engagement yet.</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: It must have slipped my mind.</p>
<p><strong>anabel</strong>: Your mind is so slippery.</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: Don’t worry, Pootchkie. My womanizing days
are over. You’re my Lady Macbeth, my Imelda… my Nicole. We’re such an
incredible team. Who could possibly stop us?</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: Don’t crunch the leaves.</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: Be a Mohican.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Wait. I hear something.</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: I’m soaked. Oh great.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Shhh.</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: Be a Mohican.</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: Uh-oh.</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: Oh I’m sorry. We must have the wrong
house.</p>
<p><strong>tony p</strong>: You sure do.</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: Hi there.</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: Superheroes.</p>
<p><strong>tony p</strong>: Should I kill them?</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: Why bother?</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: Here you go.</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: Ow.</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: Maybe you guys ought to forget this
Superhero stuff and join Kiwanis or something.</p>
<p><strong>fussy custorer</strong>: Miss!</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: Maybe she’s right.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Are you serious? This is the break we’ve
been waiting for!</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: What have the famous superheroes got that
we don’t?</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: Agents?</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Archenemies! Casanova isn’t just a
criminal– he’s a supervillain. Stopping him could be our ticket to fame,
fortune–and babes!</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: And it would be the right thing to do.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Yeah yeah–and that, too.</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: But there’s only three of us, and he’s got the
entire brotherhood of evil at his disposal.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Then maybe it’s time for us to form our own
brotherhood…</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: I’m liking this.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: I say we send out the word–and summon all
of the unsung superheroes we know!</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: Yeah, but… who do we know?</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Well… there’s the Spleen.</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: Do we have to?</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: I got this cousin. He’s a real doofus, but
he claims he can become invisible.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Have you ever seen him?</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: How could I see him if he’s invisible?</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Good point.</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: And there’s the Sphinx.</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: The who?</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: He’s a legendary masked Mexican crime fighting
superwrestler and master of the machete.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Sounds good.</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: No one’s sure that he actually exists, but
they say he can be contacted by leaving a message on a crumpled up
napkin at the Tacky Taco down by the bus station.</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: Get outta here.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: You sure that’s how you spell it?</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: So, let me get this straight. You have the
power to become invisible.</p>
<p><strong>invisible boy</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: But… only when no one is looking.</p>
<p><strong>invisible boy</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: If someone looks at you, you immediately
become visible again.</p>
<p><strong>invisible boy</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: So you’re only invisible… to yourself?</p>
<p><strong>invisible boy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>our heroes</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>invisible boy</strong>: If I look at myseif, I become
visible.</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: So you’re only invisible, when abuolutely no
one is looking at you?</p>
<p><strong>invisible boy</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: So how do you know that you’ve ever been
invisible?</p>
<p><strong>invisible boy</strong>: I just know.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Look, kid, we’ve got a lot of heroes to
interview–</p>
<p><strong>invisible boy</strong>: I know I haven’t got it entirely
worked out yet, but I’ve always dreamed of becoming a superhero… Weren’t
you guys ever a kid? Didn’t you ever need someone to just give you a
chance?</p>
<p><strong>spleen</strong>: Boy I can’t tell you how thrilled I was when
you guys called–You gonna eat that pickle? I’ve always dreamed of being
a member of the a real superhero team–and to have friends–real friends–I
mean guys I could live with–sleep with–die with–eat with…</p>
<p><strong>spleen</strong>: I love mustard.</p>
<p><strong>invisible boy</strong>: So what exactly is your
superpower?</p>
<p><strong>spleen</strong>: Well, when I was a kid I grew up on Love
Canal- -remember that?–and my brothers and I used to go swimming in
it–make Kool-Aid out of it– stuff like that. Anyway my brothers all
died, but I lived, and I grew all these like weird organs that have
never been seen in humans before. So now I can do things like this!</p>
<p><strong>spleen</strong>: Cool, huh?</p>
<p><strong>furious, raja, &amp; shoveler</strong>: Watch it!… Look out!…
Whoa!</p>
<p><strong>spleen</strong>: Sorry, sorry.</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: Hey, why don’t you just put a cork in
it?</p>
<p><strong>spleen</strong>: I tried that once. The cork melted.</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: There’s just not enough of us.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: But we know they’re out there.
Hundreds–maybe thousands of lonely, unknown superheroes, who desperately
need a cause…</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: And a social life.</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: Yeah, but how do we get to them?</p>
<p><strong>spleen</strong>: Obscene phone calls?</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: Why don’t you throw a barbecue?</p>
<p><strong>spleen</strong>: Come on in! The water’s great!</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Great picnic, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>eddie jr.</strong>: Big turnout.</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: Are these guys real superheroes?</p>
<p><strong>lenore</strong>: They think so.</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: But where’s Captain Amazing?</p>
<p><strong>eddie jr.</strong>: He wouldn’t be caught dead here.</p>
<p><strong>spleen</strong>: Hey, these pool mints are delicious!</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: Maybe there was traffic.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Who are we kidding? No one’s gonna show.
We’re living in a fantasy!</p>
<p><strong>invisible boy</strong>: Come on, guys–we’re fighting against
evil.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Good or evil, what’s the difference?</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: There’s a big difference.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: I used to believe that. Now I’m not so
sure.</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: Roy, remember, it is all within your power.
The only thing that’s in your way… is you.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Oh shut up.</p>
<p><strong>invisible boy</strong>: They’re here!</p>
<p><strong>their leader</strong>: Hey, man, is this the superhero
wingding?</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: This is it. Come on in!</p>
<p><strong>superheroes</strong>: All right! Party!</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: I am the Blue Raja, Master of Silverware.</p>
<p><strong>their leader</strong>: I am Squeegee Man, and these are my
compadres, the Invincible Dudes!</p>
<p><strong>invincible dudes</strong>: Whoa! Brews! Party!</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: Would you mind filling out these forms; names,
addresses, description of superpowers, that sort of thing.</p>
<p><strong>invincible dudes</strong>: Sure, dude. No problem.</p>
<p><strong>invincible dude 1</strong>: Hey, man, like where are the
babes?</p>
<p><strong>invincible dude 2</strong>: It said on the card there’d be
babes!</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: Actually we lied about the babes, but there’s
plenty of burgers.</p>
<p><strong>invincible dudes</strong>: That’s false advertising!… We came
all the way from South Champion, man! We coulda gone plinking!… We
coulda gone bunqee jumping!</p>
<p><strong>squeegee man</strong>: No babes. No peace.</p>
<p><strong>squeegee man</strong>: Let’s trash the place!</p>
<p><strong>invincible dudes</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: If you’re a superhero, what’s your
power?</p>
<p><strong>squeegee man</strong>: I am Squeegee Man. Touch my squeegee…
and you die.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Can you fly?</p>
<p><strong>squeegee man</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Wanna bet?</p>
<p><strong>invincible dudes</strong>: Let’s get out of here!… That
dude’s crazy!</p>
<p><strong>bowler</strong>: Who died?</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>bowler</strong>: I’m the Bowler.</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: The Bowler? I remember him from when I was
a kid. He was killed years ago.</p>
<p><strong>bowler</strong>: I’m his daughter.</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: Look, honey, being a superhero… it’s a guy
thing.</p>
<p><strong>bowler</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>bowler</strong>: Good ball.</p>
<p><strong>bowler</strong>: If it could zip up its own bag, then you’d
be impressed, right?</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Hey… Can I buy you a beer?</p>
<p><strong>bowler</strong>: I thought you’d never ask.</p>
<p><strong>bowler</strong>: He was more than just a superhero… He was my
father…</p>
<p><strong>bowler</strong>: And then one day, he didn’t come home. The
police said it was an accident. But cargo containers don’t just fall on
people. He was murdered… After that I fell apart. I dropped out of
school, became a mud wrestler, married and divorced a jerk. When my
mother died I hit bottom… but then, when I was cleaning out her attic, I
found my father’s old bowling bag and costume, almost like he’d left
them there for me… and I knew what I had to do.</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: So who killed him?</p>
<p><strong>bowler</strong>: The Disco Boys.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: You know something? Those guys are really
starting TO PISS ME OFF!</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: But there’s still only six of us.</p>
<p><strong>bowler</strong>: That’s two more than the Fantastic Four.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Half a Dirty Dozen!</p>
<p><strong>spleen</strong>: Twice the Three Stooges!</p>
<p><strong>invisible boy</strong>: And only one short of the Magnificent
Seven.</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: And you can’t count Horst Buckholtz
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>bowler</strong>: He was cute though.</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: But they all had one thing we haven’t got.</p>
<p><strong>spleen</strong>: Girlfriends?</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: A name. All the great superhero teams have got
a fabulous name.</p>
<p><strong>bowler</strong>: How about… the Savage Six?</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: The Inscrutable Six?</p>
<p><strong>spleen</strong>: The Six Pistols?</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: The Exterminators!</p>
<p><strong>invisible boy</strong>: The Obliterators!</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: The Eradicators!</p>
<p><strong>bowler</strong>: The Emasculators!</p>
<p><strong>spleen</strong>: Wait–I got it!… The Spleen Team.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: To hell with a name. Let’s get to work.</p>
<p><strong>tony p</strong>: Little old lady. That’s a hundred
points!</p>
<p><strong>tony p</strong>: He knows your every move.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Let’s say hello.</p>
<p><strong>tony p</strong>: Not these guys again!</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: Nice car.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: What did you do with Captain Amazing?</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: Captain who?</p>
<p><strong>tony p</strong>: Hey, in the backseat, who are you supposed
to be, the Bowler?</p>
<p><strong>bowler</strong>: I’m his daughter.</p>
<p><strong>tony p</strong>: His daughter? Well guess what, sweetheart?
I’m the one who squished your Daddy. And he squished real good!</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Waste him!</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Shall I check your oil?</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Looks fine.</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: That boy’s got talent.</p>
<p><strong>tony p</strong>: And I’m gonna nip it in the bud.</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: To us!</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: Whatever our name is.</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: Even his snores smell bad.</p>
<p><strong>bowler</strong>: But she’s your mother. You gotta tell
her.</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>invisible boy</strong>: Dad thinks all this superhero stuff
is a stupid waste of time.</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: But he plays golf, right?</p>
<p><strong>invisible boy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: I’m her only son, and she always had such high
hopes for me. Medicine. Law.</p>
<p><strong>bowler</strong>: But you’re a superhero.</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: The cape. The turban. She wouldn’t
understand.</p>
<p><strong>bowler</strong>: I know… My girlfriends all dumped me after I
put on the mask. They thought I’d lost it.</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: But in fact… you’d found it.</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: This is your dream… and you can’t ever
give it up.</p>
<p><strong>invisible boy</strong>: I wonder what he dreams about?</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: We don’t want to know.</p>
<p><strong>tony p</strong>: There.</p>
<p><strong>bowler</strong>: It’s late. I’m headin’ home.</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: Me, too.</p>
<p><strong>bowler</strong>: Come on, Junior, it’s a school night.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Anybody up for a little White Castle?</p>
<p><strong>tony p</strong>: Hi, cutie.</p>
<p><strong>tony p</strong>: Six losers. Six bullets. Perfect… Got any
last words, Angry Boy?</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Disco sucks.</p>
<p><strong>tony p</strong>: Disco sucks. Very good. You know what I’m
gonna do, Angry Boy, since you’re so colorful? I’m gonna save you for
last.</p>
<p><strong>tony p</strong>: Sweet dreams, punk.</p>
<p><strong>man in mask</strong>: Buenos naches.</p>
<p><strong>tony p</strong>: Get him!</p>
<p><strong>man in mask</strong>: Would you like me to trim the
sides?</p>
<p><strong>tony p</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: You’re the Sphinx.</p>
<p><strong>sphinx</strong>: And you are a fool.</p>
<p><strong>sphinx</strong>: You call yourselves superheroes? A rooster
fights more intelligently than you! You have shown yourself to your
enemy and revealed your powers to him–and what have you accouplished for
this? You have destroyed his car. Brilliant! If you want to survive you
must fight like a wolf pack–not like a six pack!</p>
<p><strong>sphinx</strong>: The wolf is cunning. He knows that stealth
is his greatest weapon, and he always fights as a team…</p>
<p><strong>sphinx</strong>: Casanova Frankenstein is a a master of evil.
You will need more than shovels and dessert forks to stop him… What else
have you got?</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: So what else has Superman got?</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: He’s got the fact that he’s Superman!</p>
<p><strong>bowler</strong>: Bullets bounce off him!</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: Firepower costs money.</p>
<p><strong>invisible boy</strong>: Anybody got any?</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: We didn’t think this through very
well.</p>
<p><strong>bowler</strong>: My father had this friend… He was an
inventor…</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: Are you sure he’s still lives here?</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: Are you sure he’s still alive?</p>
<p><strong>bowler</strong>: He was the last time I saw him.</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: When was that?</p>
<p><strong>bowler</strong>: I was eight.</p>
<p><strong>heller</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>bowler</strong>: Doctor Heller?</p>
<p><strong>heller</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>bowler</strong>: It’s me… Elizabeth.</p>
<p><strong>heller</strong>: Elizabeth! Little Elizabeth! Why you’re so…
middle aged!</p>
<p><strong>bowler</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>heller</strong>: How’s your dad?</p>
<p><strong>bowler</strong>: He’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>heller</strong>: Oh that’s right–they squished him… Heck of a
guy.</p>
<p><strong>bowler</strong>: Doc, these are my friends. We’re
superheroes, and we need your help.</p>
<p><strong>heller</strong>: Well, I give to the United Way, and I feel
that sort of covers–</p>
<p><strong>sphinx</strong>: Doctor, we need your weapons.</p>
<p><strong>heller</strong>: My weapons? You need my weapons?</p>
<p><strong>heller</strong>: The military establishment has never
understood me. They won’t return my phone calls, much less field test
anything. But I knew that someday I’d get my chance, and now… here you
are!</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: But, Doc… where’s the machine guns?</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: The bazookas?</p>
<p><strong>invisible boy</strong>: The lasers?</p>
<p><strong>heller</strong>: You don’t need that junk! You see, for
thousands of years mankind has been immolating, disemboweling, and
exploding itself. Why? Because we have this built-in screwed up need to
go to war!</p>
<p><strong>heller</strong>: Now here’s a beauty! I call it the Shrinker!
I developed it after years of studying the worst dry cleaners I could
find. It instantly shrinks fabrics to half their size. Anyone caught in
its spray is immediately immobilized by their own clothing!</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Let’s get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>bowler</strong>: Hey, Mister Bad Mood.</p>
<p><strong>bowler</strong>: Catch.</p>
<p><strong>heller</strong>: He’s got the air cannon!</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Doc, you’re a genius!</p>
<p><strong>heller</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Okay! We got the firepower! I say we throw
it into the car, drive over to Casanova’s house, and kick some ass!</p>
<p><strong>sphinx</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>sphinx</strong>: We are not yet ready. Now we must learn to
fight together… as one thing.</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: Twenty years ago all the major hoodlums of
this city were united into one great brotherhood of evil, and Casanova
was their king.</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: Crime was rampant. It wasn’t safe to stay
in your home.</p>
<p><strong>bowler</strong>: Much less go outside.</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: Then Captain Amazing appeared.</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: He busted Casanova and sent the crooks
packing.</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: And this has been a pretty nice place to
live ever since.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: But now Casanova’s back! And we’re gonna
sit around here all night eating pizza and telling stories! Hey, lets
toast some marshmellows!</p>
<p><strong>sphinx</strong>: The wise snake coils before he strikes.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: And a skunk stinks!</p>
<p><strong>sphinx</strong>: You drink too much.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: When are you going to take off that
mask?</p>
<p><strong>sphinx</strong>: When I am sure I am among friends.</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: Roy–</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Go dance with your mother, Jeffrey!</p>
<p><strong>sphinx</strong>: Your rage is a very great power, but it
blinds you to your heart.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: My heart died a long time ago.</p>
<p><strong>sphinx</strong>: It is not dead. It is hiding.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Blow it out your bean hole, Pancho!… And to
hell with the rest of you!… Look at you. Bunch of rejects. I didn’t need
you before– and I don’t need you now! The great ones RIDE ALONE! Adios,
muchachos!</p>
<p><strong>bowler</strong>: Has he always been like this?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Oh this place looks great.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Now honey, you just wait in the car. Mommy
and Daddy will be right beck.</p>
<p><strong>little furious</strong>: Pow! Bang! Wham!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: It’s nice and cool in here.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Barkeep, a couple of cold ones.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: And here’s a banana for your monkey.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Couple more?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: You bet.</p>
<p><strong>little furious</strong>: Mommy! Daddy! Mommy! Daddy!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: Alone tonight?</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Every night.</p>
<p><strong>spleen</strong>: Adolescence was the worst–The other kids
made fun of me, so I’d spit on them and they’d scatter–I’ve never had a
girlfriend–unless you count that night with my cousin–She recovered
fully though–We exchange cards every Christmas–Well, I send her one, and
she sends it back… Bug repellent?</p>
<p><strong>invisible boy</strong>: Where are they going?</p>
<p><strong>spleen</strong>: Kid!</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: …still no sign of millionaire Lance Hunt, and
now, in an unrelated story, another one of Champion City’s leading
citizens has apparently disappeared. Captain Amazing has not been seen
or heard from in a week. Authorities believe that the hard working
superhero may just be taking a well deserved rest.</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: Cancun perhaps?</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Sounds good to me, Don.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Monica… I was wondering if–uh-maybe we–I
mean you and I–could-uh–you know–get a–I mean have a…</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: Date?</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: I get off work in fifteen minutes. Walk me
home?</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: That was easy.</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: Honey, our ship’s come in.</p>
<p><strong>disco boy</strong>: Just give me the word.</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: Wait. I’ll be right there.</p>
<p><strong>anabel</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: Head hunting.</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: I admire you.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: Being a superhero, wanting to save the
world. It’s so… unselfish.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: It is?</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: Most people just want to make money or be
famous or something. But you risk everything, just to help people.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: I wouldn’t mind being famous.</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: Who wouldn’t?</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: I’ve never been able to figure out what to
do with my life, which is why I guess I’m still a waitress.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Nothing wrong with being a waitress.</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: What’s your real name?</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Roy.</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: Have you always lived here?</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: Me too… I love this stupid old town. It’s
noisy. It’s smelly. It’s falling apart.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: It’s home.</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: I’ve thought of leaving, going to Chicago or
New York, but…</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: What have they got that we ain’t got?</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: Champion’s going to bounce back, and I want
to be here when it does.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Me, too.</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: You don’t seem very angry right now.</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: You know what? Underneath all that anger I
think there’s just a little boy who wants everyone to love him.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: I just want to be a superhero.</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: That’s what I mean… ’Night, Roy.</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: Going my way?</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: Take it easy–take it easy. I just want to
have a little chat… That was quite a number you did on my car. You’ve
got a lot of violence in you… and I like that in a guy.</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: You know what the difference is between
good and evil, Roy?</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: Evil is more fun. When you want something,
you just take it, and if somebody gets in your way, you kill them… You
seem like a very frustrated guy, Roy. Unhappy. Unfulfilled. What is it
that you’ve always wanted, always desired? Because whatever it is, I can
give it to you… Fame? Easy. Fortune? Even easier. Women? The easiest of
all.</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: I’ll let you in on a little secret, Roy.
In two days this entire city will belong to me, and there’s not a damn
thing your little pals can do about it. It’s the perfect time to switch
teams… So what do you say?</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: You’re nuts.</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: They always call the great ones nuts.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: And the nuts always call themselves
great.</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: Are you with me… or against me?</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Against.</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: Too bad. PLUG HIM!</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Thanks for reminding me which team I’m
on.</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: You’re dead.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: So are you!</p>
<p><strong>anabel</strong>: Be careful with my baby.</p>
<p><strong>guard 1</strong>: Freeze!</p>
<p><strong>guard 2</strong>: Hands up!</p>
<p><strong>guard 2</strong>: What are you two doing here?</p>
<p><strong>guard 1</strong>: Not talking, eh? That can be fixed. Turn
around, start walking up the hill–</p>
<p><strong>guard 2</strong>: And no funny business.</p>
<p><strong>spleen</strong>: Pinch ’em.</p>
<p><strong>invisible boy</strong>: Whatever was in that crate… is from
Russia.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Is there room in the pack for one more
wolf?</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: I was wrong… I need my friends.</p>
<p><strong>sphinx</strong>: Amigo.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Casanova said that in two days the entire
city would belong to him… and there wasn’t a thing that we could do
about it.</p>
<p><strong>bowler</strong>: What did he mean?</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: I dunno.</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: Maybe it’s time we checked that place
out.</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: But how do we get in?</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: We just become like the wolf… who wears the
sheep’s clothing.</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: So where’s the art?</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: He hasn’t stolen it yet.</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: This place is built like a fortress.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Because thats what it is.</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: Oh my God… Every crook in the city is
here.</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: The Bone Heads from the South Side…</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: The Bland Boys from Downtown…</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: Italian Ice…</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: The Stapler…</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: The Elvis Brothers.</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: Monica… Beautiful name. It suits you.</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: I hope you won’t take this the wrong way,
but I couldn’t help but notice… that you’re a dead ringer for Veronica
Lake in “The Blue Dahlia”.</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: Are you an actress?</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: Just a waitress.</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: You underestimate yourself.</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: You know I’m writing a play–it’s just a
little Broadway thing, but thure’s a part in it that I think you’d be
perfect for.</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: I’d love to hear you read it. Could you
stick around after the luncheon?</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: Sure–I guess.</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: Terrific.</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: What are you three doing here? This is
invited guests only. Out.</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: That was too close.</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: But we gotta find out what’s going on in
there.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: It’s me.</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: What are you guys doing here?</p>
<p><strong>raja &amp; shoveler</strong>: Shhhh!</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: Thank you all for coming. I hope you enjoy
the cigars. I had to kill a dozen Cubans to get them.</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: Twenty years ago, this town was yours! AND
I</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: But they called me a psycho, and they put
me away. For twenty years I rotted in my cell, painting watercolors,
writing haikus–just waiting for the day I could take my revenge. Well,
brothers, that day has come!</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: They thought I was crazy? Well the joke’s
on them–because tonight at precisely midnight–on the twentieth
anniversary of my tragic arrest– every man, woman, and child in this
city is going to turn into a RAVING PSYCSOTIC! Mothers will murder their
tots! Old ladies will strangle their cats! Children will bump off their
babysitters!</p>
<p><strong>italian ice</strong>: You’re outta your mind!</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: I beg your pardon?</p>
<p><strong>italian ice</strong>: Nobody could drive a whole city
crazy.</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: Tell you what, Ice. I’ll mke you a
friendly little wager. It I can’t do it… you can blow my brains out. If
I can, I’ll blow out yours.</p>
<p><strong>italian ice</strong>: Done.</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: Honey, give the boys a taste.</p>
<p><strong>crooks</strong>: That was great!… What the hell was that?…
How did you do that?</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: Tonight, at midnight, that sound will be
amplified across this entire city. Murder and mayhem will reign supreme!
And Champion City will be ours again! This will be our castle! And I
will be our king! And there’s no one to stop us!</p>
<p><strong>amazing</strong>: Not so fast, Casanova!</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: Don’t worry, fellas… I killed him… and
I’ve had him stuffed.</p>
<p><strong>amazing</strong>: Isn’t my butt cute in these tights? Blue is
my color. Oh, my abs are killing me!</p>
<p><strong>elvis brother i</strong>: The King is back!</p>
<p><strong>elvis brother 2</strong>: Long live the King!</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: What could have made such a horrible
noise?</p>
<p><strong>heller</strong>: He’s got the Psychostridulator.</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: The what?</p>
<p><strong>heller</strong>: Ten years ago the Kremlin’s top secret
Psychiatric Warfare Division developed a prototype for a weapon that
emitted a fluctuating alternative frequency noise that produced a
violent psychotic reaction in any mammal within hearing distance. But
when the old Soviet Union fell the stridulator and its brilliant
inventor, Doctor Kopov, disappeared.</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: This Kopov, what happened to him?</p>
<p><strong>heller</strong>: Not him… her.</p>
<p><strong>bowler</strong>: Did she look like that?</p>
<p><strong>heller</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>spleen</strong>: Maybe it won’t work.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: It works.</p>
<p><strong>heller</strong>: A village in Siberia was wiped out when a
cleaning woman switched it on by mistake.</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: We’ve got to warn the city.</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: No one will believe us.</p>
<p><strong>bowler</strong>: They’ll think we’re just a bunch of
weirdoes.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: We know what we gotta do.</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: We’re outnumbered twenty to one.</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: It’s suicide.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Maybe. But this isn’t about living or
dying. It’s about good versus evil, and we’re good, whether we like it
or not… Maybe we look a little funny…</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: And smell a little funny. We’re not
bulletproof and we can’t fly. But we’re superheroes–and that means doing
what’s right- -even when it’s impossible… This is our city- -these are
our friends, our famlies–and if we don’t save them, nobody will! So I
say we take a ride up that hill, blast our way in there, destroy that
Psycho-whatchamabob– and teach those deviants a lesson they’ll never
forget!</p>
<p><strong>sphinx</strong>: Now you’re talking.</p>
<p><strong>bowler</strong>: Sounds good to me.</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: Let’s do it.</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: And we’ll take a bunch of ’em with us!</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: I just want you guys to know–I may not be a
superhero, but I’m with you–and I want to help!</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: Oh that’s great… Thanks, Monica…</p>
<p><strong>bowler</strong>: We could really use some coffee–</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: And some sandwiches–</p>
<p><strong>spleen</strong>: With mustard!</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: But that place is huge and we don’t know where
this psycho thing is–</p>
<p><strong>bowler</strong>: Or even what it looks like.</p>
<p><strong>heller</strong>: And he must have it well hidden.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: We’ll just have to get lucky.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Go do what you gotta do. We’ll meet back
here at sunset… Do or die.</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: Do or die.</p>
<p><strong>sphinx</strong>: Victoria o morte.</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: Baby, if I don’t make it… find yourself… a
normal guy.</p>
<p><strong>lucille</strong>: I don’t want a normal guy.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Jeffrey, YOU THIEF!</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: Mother… it’s not what you think!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: And why are you wearing that silly
costume?</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: Because… I’M A SUPERHERO!</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: Oh, Mother, I’m sorry. I know how much you
wanted me to be a doctor or a lawyer with a family–but it’s just not who
I am!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: But… the silverware?</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: I use it… to fight evil.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Jeffrey… this is wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: It is?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: I always knew that you were special.</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: You did?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Ever since you were a little boy… Come with
me.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: This is for you.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Your Great Great Grandmother’s wedding
silver.</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: Bitchin’.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Try it again!</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Come on, baby… Come on, baby… I SAID
COME</p>
<p><strong>bowler</strong>: Mon Capitan, it’s for you.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: It’s me.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Monica, where are you?</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: At the Frankenstein Center.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Are you nuts? Get out of there!</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: I’m going inside.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: Listen, Casanova may be a supervillain, but
he’s got a weakness, and I’m it. Maybe–just maybe–I can trick him into
showing me the location of the whatchamathing.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: He’s a psycho! He’ll kill you!</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: Just shut up and listen. Hold off the attack
as long as you can. If I can discover the location I’ll call you–</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: And what if you get killed?</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: Then at least I will have died trying,
right?</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: Roy… We might never see each other again, so
I’d better tell you now… I think you’re wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: Bye.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Monica!</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: Could you tell Mr. Frankenstein that Monica
is here?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Sure, doll.</p>
<p><strong>bowler</strong>: Hey… you okay?</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: I thought you’d chickened out on me.</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: Just wanted to… powder my nose.</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: How ’bout giving me “the tour”?</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: Big, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: Don’t worry. It’s not activated.</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: Who’s the artist?</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: Me.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Listen. He’s lonely… and he doesn’t care
who knows it.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: We’re all the same really. Our songs, our
dreams, our seeds are all just a brave attempt to live forever.</p>
<p><strong>sphinx</strong>: He is in love. His anger is gone.</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: Oh no.</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: Great timing!</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Has Monica called?</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: This is where I come to… be alone.</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: Oh, look at that view.</p>
<p><strong>heller</strong>: Snap out of it!</p>
<p><strong>bowler</strong>: Get on to yourself!</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: But I just don’t feel it.</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: He’s turned into a completely normal
person!</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Normal. What’s normal? Does normal exist?
And if it did, how would we know it?</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: You know, Eddie, that was really uncalled
for.</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: I’m chilly.</p>
<p><strong>spleen</strong>: Look! Your favorite sunglasses!</p>
<p><strong>bowler</strong>: Your Roy Rogers coffee mug!</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: Your Spiderman Pez dispenser!</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Okay, you win. I’m pissed off. I’m
seriously peeved.</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: Come here.</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: I’m not that kind of girl.</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: Then why are you here?</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: Curiosity.</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: Remember the cat.</p>
<p><strong>anabel</strong>: What are you doing all alone in the
dark?</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: Fantasizing… about you.</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: I thought you were done?</p>
<p><strong>anabel</strong>: One last tweak.</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: If this doesn’t do it, nothing will!</p>
<p><strong>bowler</strong>: It’s working!</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: This music is just SO BEAUTIFUL!</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: It’s time.</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: With or without him, we gotta go!</p>
<p><strong>anabel</strong>: Our guests are waiting.</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: I’ll be down in a jiffy.</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: I’d better go.</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: You’re a spy.</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: I saw him walk you home.</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: Roy.</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: Don’t be afraid… I never hit a lady…</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: Stay away!</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: Or you’ll what? CAN ME?</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: That bitch!</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: But she still might call!</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: Are you coming or not?</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: I’ll drive.</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: Not a chance!</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: Come on, guys… Pick up…</p>
<p><strong>casanova’s voice</strong>: What’s the matter…</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: Nobody home?</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: Here we go!</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: We’ve got lift off!</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: May the forks be with us!</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: First is good.</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: I want her alive.</p>
<p><strong>guards</strong>: Yes, Mr. Frankenstein.</p>
<p><strong>little boy</strong>: Daddy, what is that thing?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: I don’t know, son.</p>
<p><strong>drunk</strong>: A Herkimer? Those yuppies will drive
anything.</p>
<p><strong>sphinx</strong>: Amigo, we need you.</p>
<p><strong>invisible boy</strong>: Just GET MAD!</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: Fellas, this is woman without whom I would
have gone sane.</p>
<p><strong>guard 1</strong>: What the hell is that?</p>
<p><strong>guard 2</strong>: Looks like… a Ford Dumpster.</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: Hang on!</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: It’s showtime.</p>
<p><strong>tony p</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Mr. Frankenstein, we’re being attacked.</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: By whom?</p>
<p><strong>voice of guard</strong>: We don’t know!</p>
<p><strong>tony p</strong>: They’ll never get through those doors.</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: Come on, baby!</p>
<p><strong>bowler</strong>: Do it, big boy!</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: Atta, girl!</p>
<p><strong>bowler</strong>: Atta, boy!</p>
<p><strong>voice of guard</strong>: Mr. Frankenstein, they’re in!</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: Well kill them.</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: Where am I going?</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: Through there!</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: No good! She’s dead!</p>
<p><strong>tony p</strong>: Spam in a can!</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Cover me!</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: With what?</p>
<p><strong>elvis brother 1</strong>: Who are those guys?</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: Not bad for a normal guy!</p>
<p><strong>sphinx</strong>: Amigos!</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: Do or die!</p>
<p><strong>heller</strong>: Wait! Look!</p>
<p><strong>heller</strong>: Laser eye… and it’s a humdinger.</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: No problem.</p>
<p><strong>tony p</strong>: We’ll take care of these clowns.</p>
<p><strong>elvis brother 2</strong>: Piece a cake.</p>
<p><strong>bone head leader</strong>: No sweat.</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: Doc, there’s got to be a way.</p>
<p><strong>monica’s voice</strong>: It’s up here! It’s up here!</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Monica!</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: Thanks, Roy! She’s just my type. You can
have her back… when I’m done!</p>
<p><strong>heller</strong>: He’ll never make it.</p>
<p><strong>bowler</strong>: Think positive.</p>
<p><strong>invisible boy</strong>: I can do it.</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: Some girls just know how to die.</p>
<p><strong>anabel</strong>: You two timing psychotic bastard.</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: Darling, you’ve got the wrong idea.</p>
<p><strong>anabel</strong>: Do I?</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: I was only strangling her… I’ve killed
hundreds of women. It doesn’t mean a thing. Pootchkie, you’re
over-reacting. This is our night. It’s what we’ve lied for… cheated for…
murdered for. She’s just a plaything, a trifle… You’re the only woman
who’s ever meant anything to me. I adore you. I worship you. I want to
make you my bride.</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: There’s just one thing… I don’t need you
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: Don’t worry, Darling. I never hit a
lady.</p>
<p><strong>bowler</strong>: Heads up!</p>
<p><strong>invisible boy</strong>: Guys, I did it! I did it! I’m
invisible!</p>
<p><strong>invisible boy</strong>: Can you see me?</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>invisible boy</strong>: Nuts.</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: Kid, turn that thing off!</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: This is it! DO OR DIE!</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: And the light goes out…</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Frankenstein!</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: Roy… What took you so long?</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: Let me guess… Bullets don’t hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: They hurt… BUT THEY DON’T STOP ME!</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: Smarts, doesn’t it?… Shall we dance?</p>
<p><strong>tony p</strong>: Let’s rush ’em!</p>
<p><strong>disco boys</strong>: Help!… Get me out of this!</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: Gentlemen!</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: Roy, you’re making this too easy.</p>
<p><strong>tony p</strong>: Say hello to Daddy for me!</p>
<p><strong>bowler</strong>: Daddy says hello.</p>
<p><strong>casanova</strong>: Let’s change the tune.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Is… that… all you got?</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Nice dancing with you.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Monica…</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: You’re beautiful when you’re angry.</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: Mama!</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: I’m home.</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: Few details have emerged…</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: …but the Dawn Patrol got this exclusive
interview vith two of the suspects.</p>
<p><strong>elvis brother i</strong>: I don’t know who those guys
were–but I never want to see ’em again.</p>
<p><strong>elvis brother 2</strong>: Especially that big dude with the
shovel…</p>
<p><strong>elvis brother 1</strong>: He was the worst!</p>
<p><strong>kids</strong>: Dad!… Dad!… You okay?… You hurt?</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: I’m okay–I’m all right.</p>
<p><strong>eddie jr.</strong>: Lean on me, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>lenore</strong>: I’ll hold your shovel, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: You want a soda, Dad?</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: Nice work. Dad.</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: Thanks, Roland.</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: You really are a superhero, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: And that’s when the engine blew up.</p>
<p><strong>kids</strong>: Whoa…</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: What did you do?</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>doc heller</strong>: So you’re never actually conscious of
range or trajectory?</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: Heck no. I just chuck ’em.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: It’s been twenty-four hours since the deadly
psycho-sonic attack and bloody shoot-out that left Casanova Frankenstein
and dozen of the city’s top hoodlums dead… But tonight the question
remains… Who were these heroic mystery men who saved our city?…</p>
<p><strong>bowler</strong>: Could have been anybody.</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: Wait a minute… That’s it. That’s our name.
We’re… the Mystery Men.</p>
<p><strong>bowler</strong>: Hey, do I look like a Man?</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: Well we can’t call ourselves the Mystery
People.</p>
<p><strong>spleen</strong>: Mystery, Mystery Man… I want to be a Mystery
Man…</p>
<p><strong>shoveler &amp; raja</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>bowler</strong>: Eat your mustard.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: It doesn’t matter what we call ourselves.
We know who we are.</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: Yes, Obie-wan.</p>
<p><strong>invisible boy</strong>: Hey… he’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>raja</strong>: “Until you need me again… Adios.”</p>
<p><strong>shoveler</strong>: I miss him already.</p>
<p><strong>furious</strong>: Amigos, duty calls.</p>
<p><strong>patron</strong>: Miss… who are those guys?</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
