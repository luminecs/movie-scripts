<h1 id="erik-the-viking">erik-the-viking</h1>
<p><strong>helga</strong>: Have you done this sort of thing before?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Me? Of course! I’ve been looting and pillaging
up and down the coast.</p>
<p><strong>helga</strong>: Looting and pillaging, eh?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>helga</strong>: What about the raping?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>helga</strong>: It’s obvious you haven’t raped anyone in your
life.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Sh! He covers her mouth with his free hand,
and looks round to make sure no one’s heard. Then he carries on trying
to undo his trousers, but he is now somewhat more than half-hearted
about it. Helga watches suspiciously.</p>
<p><strong>helga</strong>: Do you LIKE women? Erik is clearly shocked
and stung by the insinuation. He stops.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Of course I like women… I LOVE ’em.</p>
<p><strong>helga</strong>: You don’t love ME.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: No… right… this is RAPE… Mark you, I’m not
saying I couldn’t get to like you… in fact… well, to be quite honest, I
prefer it when there’s some sort of mutual feeling between two
people…</p>
<p><strong>helga</strong>: What - rape?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: No. It isn’t rape then, is it?</p>
<p><strong>helga</strong>: Oh, get it over with.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: I don’t suppose… no…</p>
<p><strong>helga</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: I don’t suppose you… you DO like me at
all?</p>
<p><strong>helga</strong>: What d’you expect? You come in here, burn my
village, kill my family and try to rape me… This is too much for Erik.
We withers under the irony.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: I’ll kill you if you say anything about this
to anyone.</p>
<p><strong>helga</strong>: About raping me?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: About NOT raping you…</p>
<p><strong>helga</strong>: You DON’T like it, do you?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Well it just seems a little bit crude, that’s
all.</p>
<p><strong>helga</strong>: What about the killing and looting? That’s
just as crude, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Oh well - you’ve GOT to do them.</p>
<p><strong>helga</strong>: Why? Why have you got to go round killing and
looting?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: To pay for the next expedition, of course.</p>
<p><strong>helga</strong>: But that’s a circular argument! If the only
reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the
only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next
expedition, they cancel each other out.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Oh! Stop talking as if we were married!</p>
<p><strong>helga</strong>: Well you started it.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: I just said I didn’t feel like raping you.</p>
<p><strong>helga</strong>: And I was just saying that rape is no MORE
pointless or crude than all the killing and looting that goes on. Erik
vents of his frustration on the already shattered door.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Scream.</p>
<p><strong>helga</strong>: Ah.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Louder.</p>
<p><strong>helga</strong>: Aaagh! Rape!</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Oh, thanks Two more Vikings burst in with eyes
blazing. They have the very unfortunate names of Ernest and Jennifer,
but it doesn’t really matter, for reasons which will become obvious very
quickly. They are also slightly drunk.</p>
<p><strong>ernest</strong>: Rape?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Where? Jennifer the Viking sways and leans
against a door post. The marauder’s eyes come to rest on Erik and Helga
who are standing, fully clothed, about six feet apart. They look
slightly puzzled.</p>
<p><strong>helga</strong>: He raped me standing up. There is a pause.
Erik looks up at Helga. Why has she saved his face by telling this lie?
Jennifer the Viking turns to Erik.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: You finished, then?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Oh… yes… I suppose so…</p>
<p><strong>ernest</strong>: Right! Me first!</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: No! I asked! Ernest leaps on top of Helga
and pins her to the ground. Jennifer joins in. Erik looks stunned for a
moment. Then he suddenly leaps to Helga’s defence.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Leave her alone! He pulls Jennifer off, but
Jennifer fights back. Erik forces Jennifer back until he falls into the
kneading trough. They fight in the dough for some moments, until Erik
runs Jennifer through. The dough is stained red, and the film is rid of
such an inappropriately named Viking once and for all. Erik then turns
his attention on Ernest who is still on top of Helga. Without a moment’s
hesitation, Erik runs him through the back. Ernest screams. So does
Helga. Erik turns white, and pulls out his sword. Ernest falls over into
a heap with his co-misnomer, and Erik kneels beside Helga to find a
bloodstain under her breast where he has inadvertently run her through.
She is clearly not long for this world.</p>
<p><strong>helga</strong>: Thanks for saving me from a fate worse than
death.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: I didn’t mean to!</p>
<p><strong>helga</strong>: Oh, that’s all right then… it’s the thought…
that counts… Erik cradles her head and tries helplessly to staunch the
blood.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: You told them I raped you - why?</p>
<p><strong>helga</strong>: I dunno… you looked so… so vulnerable…</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Why should you care?</p>
<p><strong>helga</strong>: Why… should YOU care?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Tell me your name? Helga looks up at him, but
dies in his arms, without ever saying her name.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Tell me… what IS it…? Erik realizes she has
gone. He gazes at her for some time. He looks around at the two dead
bodies beside them. Then he listens to the sound of raping and slaughter
continuing on the outside. Screams and bloodthirsty shuts echo alongside
the roar of flames and the cries of animals. The camera tracks into a
big close-up on Erik. Superimpose the title: ERIK THE VIKING: Second
title: TIM ROBBINS. Mix through to wide shot of the burning village.
Figures running here and there. Superimpose the rest of the opening
titles. By the last of the opening titles the last of the flames are
dying down. Cut to a close-up of a very loud-looking Viking screaming
into the camera, as he hurls an axe. This Viking’s name is Thorfinn
Skull- Splitter. The axe thuds into the wall a few inches away from the
face of a frightened girl, Unn, who is pinned to the wall with her
braids spread out. The Vikings are hurling axes at her a la Kirk Douglas
in THE VIKINGS. Several Vikings sitting at ale-bench, laugh in a rather
unpleasant way. Erik, however, frowns. He is sitting at a table on a
dais, next to his grandfather, the chief of the village. His grandfather
almost chokes with merriment. Erik’s mother glances at him with some
hostility. Meanwhile the drunken Thorfinn has just lifted the totally
legless Ivar the Boneless up off the floor and presses an axe into his
hand. A tremor of nervousness ripples round the females in the Mead
Hall. Ivar is clearly in no condition to throw anything, except,
perhaps, the contents of his stomach. Unn winces. Finally, amidst much
giggling, Ivar throws wildly, and the axe smashes into a jug being
carried by one of the serving girls. The menfolk erupt into drunken
hysterics at this. The women clearly feel that the occasion is getting
out of hand. But before any of them can work up enough courage to
intervene, Thorfinn Skull-Splitter has thrust an axe into the hands of
the even more plastered Sven the Berserk. Now Sven is not the Viking to
let a little matter like not being able to see straight stop him heaving
the axe at a young maiden. He takes the axe and whirls it wildly over
his head. Even the other drunken Vikings realize this could be
dangerous, and they cower behind the table. Sven lets go of the axe. Unn
shuts her eyes prepared for the worst. There is a dull thud and a grunt
and then a whoop of mirth. Unn opens her eyes to find that the axe has
come to rest in the back of a totally stupefied Viking who merely slumps
forward onto the table he is sitting at. On the opposite side sits
Harald Missionary, a rather seedy cleric who has long since given up
trying to convert the pagans and found solace in their mead. He thinks
about intervening, but decides that it’s a bit late really and that he
might as well finish off his ale-cup instead. GRIMHILD HOUSEWIFE refills
it for him. At this moment, however, the axe-throwers have run out of
axes, so, as they go to retrieve the ones they’ve thrown, Harald
Missionary salves his conscience by lurching across to the unfortunate
Unn. He pokes his dog-eared bible under her nose.</p>
<p><strong>harald</strong>: If you were thinking of converting, my dear,
this would be an IDEAL opportunity…</p>
<p><strong>unn</strong>: Not now!</p>
<p><strong>harald</strong>: No, of course not… You might not get another
chance, you know…</p>
<p><strong>unn</strong>: Go away. At this moment another axe thuds into
the wall, speeding up Harald’s desire to get back to the ale-bench.</p>
<p><strong>harald</strong>: Yes, of course… I’ll pray for you anyway, my
dear… Suddenly an axe shatters a large earthware vessel.</p>
<p><strong>harald</strong>: Yes.. That’s what I’ll do… Harald scuttles
back to the ale-bench as fast as he can. Erik meanwhile, stares in
astonishment as, for a fleeting moment, he sees Helga, the girl he
accidentally killed, standing there with her braids spread out in place
of Unn. He shakes his head and the vision passes. In the meantime,
however, Ivar’s mum has decided that enough is enough.</p>
<p><strong>ivar’s mum</strong>: Let her go!</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>vikings</strong>: Yes, why?</p>
<p><strong>sven the berserk</strong>: Why should we let er go?</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn</strong>: We haven’t hit a single braid yet! The
Vikings all guffaw. Ivar’s mum has had enough. She throws the contents
of a jug of ale over Thorfinn. He is shocked, but after the first shock
he grins evilly, because now he’s been given carte blanche to do the
thing he enjoys doing most. Without another thought he throws a vicious
right hook at Ivar’s mum and lays her out cold. Erik reacts with
disgust. His grandad, however, gives a whoop of glee.</p>
<p><strong>grandad</strong>: Whoah! Heee! That showed her! Meanwhile a
little shrivelled old man is jumping up and down.</p>
<p><strong>ingemund the old</strong>: Hey! He hit my wife! Ingemund
starts to go for Thorfinn, but Thorhild beats him to it. She grabs one
of the long-handled cooking griddles from the fires and swings it at
Thorfinn. Thorfinn, however, ducks, and the red-hot griddle hits Sven
the Berserk, who is standing with his back to Thorfinn. Sven screams and
goes berserk, turning round and hitting Thorfinn who is now standing
upright again.</p>
<p><strong>ingemund the old</strong>: Leave him alone. Ingemund hits
Sven. Thangbrand hits Ingemund and a general fight breaks out. Erik’s
grandad clearly considers this the highlights of the evening, but Erik
looks at it in disgust and at his grandad in despair. Eventually he gets
up and walk out of the Mead Hall. His grandad notices and frowns. He
knows something’s wrong with his grandson but hasn’t a clue what it
could be. Erik’s mother frowns and nods to his grandad. Grandad gets up
and fights his way through the melee to follow Erik out of the Hall. The
snow lies thick over the village as Erik’s grandfather joins his
grandson beside the little quay. Erik is staring broodily into the
night.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: What’s the matter, son? Erik doesn’t
reply. His grandfather glances back at the Mead Hall, whence the sound
of the fight drift across the snow.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: We’re missing all the fun…</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: What’s it all about?</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: We toil and labour, we loot and pillage, rape
and kill… and yet…</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: You talking piffle, son?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Where does it all get us, Grandpa?</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Who have you been talking to?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: I met this girl…</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: It’s always the women that start the
trouble.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: She got me thinking…</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: So? What’d you do to her? Erik stops in
his tracks - as if brought up short by the horror of what he has
done.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: I… I… KILLED her…</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: That’s my boy! Erik’s grandfather gives
him a paternal hug. Erik looks at him and thinks about the generation
gap. Cut to feet running in the snow. It is day.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Freya! Erik looks around him and calls out
again.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Freya! Erik runs into the distance - a small
figure against the dramatic wintry landscape. Cut to a remote, barren
mountainside. Erik climbs up into shot, and continues climbing until he
reaches a cave. He enters it. As his eyes get used to the dark he can
make out a few signs of life: a cooking pot on a fire, a straw bed, a
pile of rune-sticks.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Freya? Freya? There is a bundle of rags behind
Erik. A head rises from it. This is Freya.</p>
<p><strong>freya</strong>: Ah… Erik… Erik the “Viking”… It is not clear
whether her words are not a little mocking.</p>
<p><strong>freya</strong>: Now what CAN you want with me, Erik the
“Viking”?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: I shouldn’t have come.</p>
<p><strong>freya</strong>: They will make fun of you for listening to an
old woman’s stories? Erik doesn’t reply. Freya watches him craftily.</p>
<p><strong>freya</strong>: Young men are only interested in fighting and
killing. Erik looks up at her sharply. It is as if she has read his
mind.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: But has it always been like that, Freya? From
the beginning of time? Freya doesn’t reply. Instead she walks to the
mouth of the cave. Erik follows her. They look out at the grey, desolate
landscape. Nothing but arctic wastes, snow and desolation. Above them
the black clouds boil ceaselessly.</p>
<p><strong>freya</strong>: What do you see, Erik?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: I see the world.</p>
<p><strong>freya</strong>: I it night or day, Erik?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: It is day, of course, Freya.</p>
<p><strong>freya</strong>: Is it summer or winter, Erik? Erik looks
round at the snowy wastes and ten back at Freya, puzzled.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: The winter is past, thank goodness, Freya. It
is summer. Freya puts her face close to Erik’s and peers into his
eyes.</p>
<p><strong>freya</strong>: Have you ever seen the sun, Erik?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: The sun is up beyond the clouds - where it
always is.</p>
<p><strong>freya</strong>: But have you ever seen it? Think back…</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Of course not… but… when I was a child…. I
remember a dream…. it was as if the whole sky was blue…</p>
<p><strong>freya</strong>: The sky WAS blue, Erik… once. Erik looks at
her.</p>
<p><strong>freya</strong>: The Old Stories tell of an age that would
come such as this - when Fenrir the Wolf would swallow the sun, and a
Great Winter would settle upon the world. It was to be an axe age, a
sword age, a storm age, when brother would turn against brother, and men
would fight each other until the world would finally be destroyed. Erik
looks out across the bleak and gloomy landscape and the black, boiling
clouds in the sky.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Then… this is the Age of Ragnarok? Freya turns
to go back into the cave.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Wait, Freya! Erik re-enters the cave.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Is there nothing men can do?</p>
<p><strong>freya</strong>: The Gods are asleep, Erik.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: I will go and wake them up! Freya turns and
looks at him. She clearly enjoys his earnest enthusiasm, but is afraid
he doesn’t know what he is talking about.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Tell me what I must do, Freya! Freya thinks
for some moments. The she speaks.</p>
<p><strong>freya</strong>: Erik… Far out in the midst of the Western
Ocean there is a land… men call it Hy-Brasil. There you will find a horn
that is called Resounding. You must take the Horn Resounding, and three
times you must blow it. The first note will take you to Asgaard. The
second will awaken the Gods, and the third note will bring you home. But
remember… once you are in the spell of the Horn, hatred will destroy
you. Erik turns to go and then hesitates.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: And will the dead ever return, Freya?</p>
<p><strong>freya</strong>: That I cannot tell you. Cut to a big close-up
of a head being banged on the ground. It is Thorfinn Skull-Splitter’s.
The person doing the banging is an enraged Sven the Berserk. Suddenly
Erik pushes his way through the crowd and separates them. There is
general disgruntlement all round, and murmurs of: “Who does he think he
is?”</p>
<p><strong>erik’s grandad</strong>: What are you doing, Erik? Thorfinn
just said SVEN’S GRANDFATHER died of old age.</p>
<p><strong>ingemund the old</strong>: They must fight to the death.</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn skull-splitter</strong>: That’s right! Sven must
kill me.</p>
<p><strong>others</strong>: Yes. Stay out of this. What’s it to do with
you? Sven grids his teeth and struggles to get at Thorfinn, but Erik
still keeps them apart.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Aren’t you afraid of death, Thorfinn
Skull-Splitter? Thorfinn shrugs.</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn</strong>: Not death by the sword! It means I shall
drink in Valhalla with the great warriors. Cut away To Harald Missionary
engaged in his usual business of chatting up any available female.</p>
<p><strong>harald missionary</strong>: You don’t still believe in all
that Valhalla stuff, do you?</p>
<p><strong>thorhild the female</strong>: Go away.</p>
<p><strong>harald</strong>: Fine… right… just checking. He moves
off.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: And you, Sven, aren’t you afraid of crossing
the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard?</p>
<p><strong>sven</strong>: I will join my grandfather there.</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn</strong>: He’s not in Valhalla! He died of old
age!</p>
<p><strong>sven</strong>: You liar! They start trying to kill each other
again, and crash through a fence into the pig-sty. Pigs squeal and run
in all directions.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Stop it!</p>
<p><strong>others</strong>: Leave them alone! Keep out of it, Erik! The
others pull Erik away.</p>
<p><strong>grandad</strong>: There’s only one way to settle it.</p>
<p><strong>everyone</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn</strong>: He MUST kill me!</p>
<p><strong>everyone</strong>: Yes! That’s right! Sven struggles again to
oblige, and they both topple into the duck pond. Erik dives back to keep
them apart.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: There is another way.</p>
<p><strong>grandad</strong>: Who gets killed?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Nobody gets killed.</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn</strong>: Oh, well… He starts attacking Sven again.
Erik decides there is only one way to make his point. He lets fly with
his fists and lays both the antagonists out for a moment.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: But it will be dangerous. Maybe none of us
will return.</p>
<p><strong>snorri the miserable</strong>: Ah well, that’s much more
sensible than just Thorfinn getting killed. Shall we all go and pack
now?</p>
<p><strong>sven</strong>: What are you talking about, Erik?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: What if we could find Bi-Frost the Rainbow
Bridge? This causes a sensation amongst everyone watching, on the lines
of “You can’t do that” and so on. They scoff at Erik.</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn</strong>: FIND the Rainbow Bridge?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Find it… AND cross it! Super-sensation amongst
everyone - except for Harald Missionary who shakes his head sadly.</p>
<p><strong>harald</strong>: Look! You can’t find somewhere that doesn’t
exist.</p>
<p><strong>grandad</strong>: Shut up! Harald shrugs.</p>
<p><strong>sven</strong>: Only the dead reach Asgaard, Erik.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: What’s the matter? Are you afraid to try?
Thorfinn and Sven are put on the defensive.</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn</strong>: Of course we’re not afraid to try, but…
Erik rounds on Thorfinn, sensing he had the advantage.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: “But” what?</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn</strong>: But…</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: What? Thorfinn’s mental powers find it hard to
articulate any proposition on such a vast metaphysical concept. Sven
comes to his rescue.</p>
<p><strong>sven</strong>: Nobody’s ever crossed the Rainbow Bridge to
Asgaard.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: We’d be the first!</p>
<p><strong>snorri</strong>: You mean we’d be dead?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: No! We’d be the first living men to set foot
in the Halls of the Gods. Pause. Uncomfortable shifting.</p>
<p><strong>sven</strong>: But HOW?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: I don’t know - but I’m not afraid to try.</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn</strong>: Well I’M certainly not, either.</p>
<p><strong>sven</strong>: Neither am I.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Then you’ll come.</p>
<p><strong>harald</strong>: But there isn’t such a place as… Look…</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn &amp; sven</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: What d’you say?</p>
<p><strong>sven</strong>: Well… I’m game.</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn</strong>: Me too. Erik grins. He has persuaded them
against their will.</p>
<p><strong>grandad</strong>: Aren’t you going to go on fighting?</p>
<p><strong>sven &amp; thorfinn</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>others</strong>: Oh… There is general disappointment all
around.</p>
<p><strong>ivar the boneless</strong>: Oh, go on…</p>
<p><strong>grandad</strong>: Just have a bit of a fight.</p>
<p><strong>ingemund the old</strong>: I’LL fight someone.</p>
<p><strong>grandad</strong>: You’re too old.</p>
<p><strong>ingemund the old</strong>: No, I ain’t. Cut to an adze
striking timber. The Viking’s ship, GOLDEN DRAGON, is being repaired and
fitted out for a JOURNEY. Erik is there, directing operations. The
camera tracks through all the activity and finally comes to rest on
Keitel Blacksmith. He is a magnificent mountain of a man in an Arnold
Schwarzeneggarish sort of way. He hammers a sword, and sparks fly, but
his eyes keep returning to the preparations for the voyage. Clearly
something is worrying him. His assistant, Loki, sidles up to him.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Wish you were going too? Keitel grunts angrily
and plunges the sword into cold water. Steam and bubbles.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: But you CAN’T because you’re too busy. Keitel
pulls the sword out of the water and tests it. It slices like as razor,
Loki watches.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Ooh, that’s a good one! You could charge
Halfdan fifteen for that one.</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: Yes, it is good. But I told him ten.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: You could charge him what you like. Loki takes
the sword from Keitel and stacks it alongside a lot more freshly made
swords.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: You just can’t make enough swords and spears
and knives and daggers to satisfy the demand. You could charge Halfdan
twenty and he’d pay it.</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: Oh, I couldn’t do that! The Blacksmith’s
Code says…</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Yes yes… of course…. the “Blacksmith’s Code”…
Keitel goes back to his forge and pulls out a fresh dollop of white-hot
ore. Loki comes up behind him.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: If this IS the Age of Ragnarok, Keitel
Blacksmith, it is GOOD to us.</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: Can’t make enough swords! Bang! Bang!
Bang!</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: Can’t make enough axe-heads! Bang! Bang!
Bang!</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: But, Keitel, if Erik ever finds the Horn
Resounding… if he ever crosses Bi-Frost, the Rainbow Bridge… if he ever
wakens the gods.. Keitel stops smiting the metal on his forge. He stares
into space.</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: They chase Fenrir the Wolf from the sky…</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: The Age of Ragnarok ends…</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: The bottom falls out of the sword
business!</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: It’s not just YOUR livelihood that’s at stake
but your son’s, and the livelihood of ALL blacksmiths.</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: My brother blacksmiths!</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: The Blacksmith’s Code says I must…</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Honour and protect all blacksmiths.</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: Together we stand!</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: You can’t let Erik do THAT. Loki smiles. He
has Keitel playing into his hands, although Keitel doesn’t realize it.
Fade. Cut to some days later. The expedition is set to leave. Thorfinn
Skull-Splitter taking leave of his mum and dad.</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn’s mum</strong>: And you’ve got BOTH axes?</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn</strong>: Yes, Mother.</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn’s mum</strong>: And something to sharpen them
with?</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn</strong>: Yes, Mum.</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn’s mum</strong>: And don’t forget: never let your
enemy get behind you.</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn</strong>: No, Mother.</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn’s mum</strong>: And keep your sword greased.</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn</strong>: Yes, Mother. Goodbye, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn’s dad</strong>: And don’t forget to was - you know -
ALL over.</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn</strong>: No, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn’s mum</strong>: And if you have to kill somebody,
KILL them! Don’t stop to think about it.</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn</strong>: I never do… Cut to Sven the Berserk who is
also being lectured. The lecture is coming from his father - Ulf the
Maddeningly Calm.</p>
<p><strong>sven’s father</strong>: It’s a tradition.</p>
<p><strong>sven</strong>: I know, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>sven’s father</strong>: I was a Berserk for King Harald
Fairhair…</p>
<p><strong>sven</strong>: You went berserk…</p>
<p><strong>sven’s father</strong>: I went berserk in every battle I ever
fought for King Harald…</p>
<p><strong>sven</strong>: So did your father…</p>
<p><strong>sven’s father</strong>: So did my father and his father
before him.</p>
<p><strong>sven</strong>: But it’s a responsibility…</p>
<p><strong>sven’s father</strong>: But it’s a responsibility being a
Berserk.</p>
<p><strong>sven</strong>: I must only let the red rage…</p>
<p><strong>sven’s father</strong>: You must only let the red rage take
hold of you in the thick of battle.</p>
<p><strong>i know! i’ve heard it all i thousand times!</strong>: A
sudden silence falls, as all the village turns to stare nervously at
Sven. He goes berserk and demolishes a nearby hut with his head. Ulf the
Maddeningly Calm shakes his head.</p>
<p><strong>sven’s father</strong>: No no… you’ll never make a Berserk.
If you let it out now you’ll have nothing left for battle…</p>
<p><strong>ivar’s mum</strong>: Besides… it’s dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>sven’s father</strong>: It’s the end of a family tradition.
In another corner of the village Leif the Lucky is standing with his
pregnant girlfriend.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Bye, Leif.</p>
<p><strong>leif</strong>: Bye… sorry…</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Yeah… well…</p>
<p><strong>leif</strong>: You will wait?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: What d’you expect me to do? She takes a
bracelet off her arm and gives it to Leif.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Wear this for luck. Leif looks at it.</p>
<p><strong>leif</strong>: That’s why they call me… Leif the Lucky.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Please. Cut to Harald Missionary dumping a bag
on board the ship. GRIMHILD HOUSEWIFE is helping him. Snorri looks at
him in surprise.</p>
<p><strong>snorri</strong>: YOU coming? You don’t even believe in
Asgaard.</p>
<p><strong>harald</strong>: I thought I might do a bit of business on
the way.</p>
<p><strong>snorri</strong>: You’re wasting your time.</p>
<p><strong>harald</strong>: Listen. I’ve been in this dump for sixteen
years and I haven’t made a single convert…</p>
<p><strong>snorri</strong>: There was Thorbjorn Vifilsson’s wife. You
converted HER.</p>
<p><strong>harald</strong>: Thorbjorn Vifilsson’s wife became a
Buddhist, not a Christian.</p>
<p><strong>snorri</strong>: Same thing, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>harald</strong>: No, it is NOT. Meanwhile in another part of
the village, Loki is strapping a large consignment of swords onto a
pony. He glances round and then sneaks surreptiously out of the village,
over the barren hills of Norway, under the boiling black skies of
Ragnarok. Back at the quayside, GOLDEN DRAGON is ready for the journey.
Erik addresses the villagers.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Well… we’ll be off now… Erik’s grandad waits
for some time before he realizes that Erik isn’t intending to say
anything else.</p>
<p><strong>grandad</strong>: You need to say a bit more than that!</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Oh… er… yes… The faces of the village-folk
turn towards him. There are many moist eyes. Erik’s mother starts to
cry.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Oh, there, Mum… Don’t be sad…. You all know
why we’re going, so don’t grieve. Maybe untold dangers do lie ahead of
us, and some of you may well be looking at the one you love for the last
time… Someone bursts out sobbing. Erik desperately tries to rally their
spirits.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: But don’t grieve! Even tough the Hordes of
Muspel tear us limb from limb… or the Fire Giants burn each and every
one of us to a cinder… More crying.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: …though we may be swallowed by the Dragon of
the North Sea or fall off the Edge of the World… don’t cry. More
crying.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: No! Don’t cry…. By this time most of the
village is blubbering profusely. Cut to Harald Missionary. He has his
arm round his weeping girlfriend.</p>
<p><strong>harald missionary</strong>: Sh… There… it’s all fantasy,
there’s no Dragon of the North Sea, no Edge of the World…</p>
<p><strong>grimhild housewife</strong>: That’s what YOU say.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: What’s the matter with them?</p>
<p><strong>grandad</strong>: Just say something cheerful.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Oh… right! Well…. CHEERS everybody! Erik
smiles broadly and waves. The entire village stares back at him with
tears in their eyes, and biting their lips. Suddenly one mother can’t
hold it back any more.</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn’s mum</strong>: Don’t go! Another mother rushes out
and grabs Ivar the Boneless.</p>
<p><strong>ivar’s mum</strong>: My son! I don’t want you to go!</p>
<p><strong>ivar</strong>: I don’t want to go, either…</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Oh gods! Please, everybody! Keep calm! It’s
not certain ALL of us are going to die… and in any case we may not die
HIDEOUS deaths… More renewed sobbing. Grandad’s eyes go heavenwards.</p>
<p><strong>grandad</strong>: I think we should go…</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Right. Farewell… for the last time… may the
gods prevent…</p>
<p><strong>grandad</strong>: No, don’t say anything else! Suddenly
Keitel Blacksmith steps forward. His muscles ripple. His handsome face
radiates heroism and manliness.</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: Wait, Erik!</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Keitel Blacksmith? They stop and turn.</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: You can’t go without me. Who will repair
your swords and mend your shields? Renewed sobs from the women.</p>
<p><strong>women</strong>: Oh, no! Ah, lackaday! Not HIM too!</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: What’s the matter now?</p>
<p><strong>unn</strong>: If Keitel Blacksmith goes with you…</p>
<p><strong>thorhild</strong>: We’ll have no one to do the things he did
for us.</p>
<p><strong>thorkatla the indiscrete</strong>: OR sharpen our knives and
make our pans. An awkward silence. The others all turn on her and frown
- a bit of shin-kicking goes on. It’s clear that Keitel is popular
amongst the womenfolk. Erik doesn’t notice.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: You will have Keitel’s assistant, Loki, to do
all that.</p>
<p><strong>women</strong>: Loki? Eurrgh!</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: What’s wrong with Loki? He’s become very good
at blacksmithing.</p>
<p><strong>women</strong>: Yes… but…</p>
<p><strong>thorkatla</strong>: He’s so small and… The others all shush
her up. More shin-kicking.</p>
<p><strong>thorhild</strong>: Oh, yes… we’ve got Loki… That’s true… Cut
to Loki leading his pony across a bleak landscape. He eventually stops
and looks ahead. There stands a gibbet with two corpses dangling from
it. He is nearing his destination. Cut back to Erik and his men getting
into GOLDEN DRAGON. Erik notices Thorfinn and Sven quarrelling over Leif
the Lucky.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Hey, you two! What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>sven</strong>: I was sitting there.</p>
<p><strong>leif</strong>: No, you weren’t.</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn</strong>: Leif’s sitting here. I need a bit of
luck.</p>
<p><strong>leif</strong>: See.</p>
<p><strong>sven</strong>: Look, I bagged it last week.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: It doesn’t matter WHERE you sit!</p>
<p><strong>sven</strong>: Yes it does! We could be at sea for
months.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Well, what difference does it make where
you’re SITTING?</p>
<p><strong>sven</strong>: I don’t want to have to sit next to Snorri all
that time. Sven nods towards Snorri the Miserable - an Eeyore of a
Viking if ever there were one.</p>
<p><strong>snorri</strong>: Thank you VERY much indeed.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Now stop it!</p>
<p><strong>snorri</strong>: It’s SO nice to feel wanted.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Leif, you sit there. Even, you sit there.
Harald, you’d better sit over there…</p>
<p><strong>snorri</strong>: Trust me to get the missionary. Suddenly
Erik notices Sven’s father climbing aboard.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: What are YOU doing here?</p>
<p><strong>sven’s dad</strong>: You may need a real Berserk.</p>
<p><strong>sven</strong>: I AM one, Dad!</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: We haven’t got a spare place.</p>
<p><strong>ivar</strong>: He can have my place. I don’t want to go
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Well, you ARE!</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: Bjorn’s not. He could have Bjorn’s
place.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: What’s the matter with Bjorn?</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn</strong>: Nothing… Halfdan the Black chopped his
hand off last night.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: HE was lucky… Sit there.</p>
<p><strong>snorri</strong>: You can’t have Sven’s father sitting next to
Sven. They’ll argue the whole time.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: That’s true. YOU’D better sit there. You
there, and Ornulf there.</p>
<p><strong>snorri</strong>: Now you’ve got all the big ones on one side.
Erik looks around. It is true that all the tall burly ones are on one
side.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: All right, you go there. You here… Sven’s dad
and Ornulf swap places.</p>
<p><strong>sven’s dad</strong>: Ohh! I wanted to sit next to Leif.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Shut up. You there. You there and you there.
Ivar and Ornulf swap places. Erik surveys this re-arrangement.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: That’s better.</p>
<p><strong>snorri</strong>: Now you’ve got all the ones with beards on
one side and all the moustaches on the other. This is true. Erik thinks
some moments and then:</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: It doesn’t matter. They start to haul the sail
up. Ropes are released. The boat rocks. Suddenly a voice cuts through
the crowd. It is Erik’s mother.</p>
<p><strong>erik’s mum</strong>: Wait! Wait! Wait!</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>erik’s mum</strong>: Here, son. She tries to hand Erik what
looks unmistakably like a pillow. Erik is dumbfounded.</p>
<p><strong>erik’s mum</strong>: Your father always made sure he could
rest his head at night. Erik is mortified. The others snigger, though
not without some sympathy for Erik. They’ve ALL been embarrassed by
their mums at one time or another.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: I can’t take THAT on a voyage!</p>
<p><strong>erik’s mum</strong>: It was your father’s! Erik will find it
hard to refuse now. But he hesitates.</p>
<p><strong>erik’s mum</strong>: It was the pillow HE took with him. He
said it once saved his life. Erik reluctantly takes the precious object.
His mother kisses him. Everyone has fallen silent now. The relatives
stand helpless on the shore as GOLDEN DRAGON starts to drift away from
them. The Vikings sit in their places, hands on the oars looking back at
their loved ones. Erik stands at the prow of GOLDEN DRAGON. For a moment
he thinks he sees the girl he killed, standing, white in death, the
spear-wound still fresh. Erik raises his hand in a half-goodbye. We cut
back to the loved ones, now the girl is no longer there. They too
half-raise their hands. Erik suddenly turns and gives a shout:</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Huuup! The oars go up and then into the water,
and GOLDEN DRAGON commences her voyage. Cut back to GOLDEN DRAGON at
sea. Snorri is feeling queasy and gazing gloomily at the receding
coastline of Norway. Thangbrand is sitting near him and feeling equally
queasy.</p>
<p><strong>snorri</strong>: Have a good look… that’s the last we’ll see
of old Norway. Snorri is desperately trying to control his insides.</p>
<p><strong>snorri</strong>: Goodbye home… goodbye family… goodbye loved
ones… Goodbye lunch…</p>
<p><strong>thangbrand</strong>: Oh! Shut up. Harald Missionary puts his
arm around Snorri.</p>
<p><strong>harald</strong>: You know, my son, our lord said…</p>
<p><strong>snorri</strong>: YOUR lord.</p>
<p><strong>harald</strong>: Quite… MY lord… said: “The Prayer of Faith
shall have the sick.”</p>
<p><strong>snorri</strong>: I hope the Dragon of the North Sea gets YOU
AND your lord. Harald Missionary gives him a condescending smile and a
weary shake of the head. He knows the Dragon of the North Sea does not
exist.</p>
<p><strong>harald</strong>: Darkness and ignorance… Meanwhile Ivar the
Boneless and Sven the Berserk are both suffering from the effects of the
sea.</p>
<p><strong>sven</strong>: It’s not so bad when you’re rowing.</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn skull-splitter</strong>: That’s right Thorfinn gobs
onto the whetstone with which he is sharpening his axe. Sven can control
himself no longer. He rushes for the side.</p>
<p><strong>sven the berserk</strong>: I want to die. This sets off
Ivar.</p>
<p><strong>ivar the boneless</strong>: Uh oh! He leaps up and pukes over
the side. Mass puking breaks out all over the boat. Keitel Blacksmith
looks around at his preoccupied shipmates, and it slowly dawns upon him
that this might be the moment to try a little sabotage. He goes to the
ship’s lodestone, which is hanging from the mast. Keitel glances around.
No one is looking, but this sort of covert behaviour goes against his
normally sunny and open disposition.</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: The Blacksmith’s Code… He steels himself,
takes down the lodestone, snaps out the piece of metal in the base and
throws it over the side. Keitel hangs it up again on the mast.</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>ivar</strong>: No, I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn</strong>: You don’t need to feel bad about being
sea-sick, you know.</p>
<p><strong>ivar</strong>: How can you help feeling bad when you’re
sea-sick?</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn</strong>: I mean many of the greatest sailors were.
Pause.</p>
<p><strong>ivar</strong>: I know. I know.</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn</strong>: Olaf Tryggvason used to throw up on every
single voyage… the whole time… non-stop… puke… puke… puke.</p>
<p><strong>ivar</strong>: Look! I don’t feel BAD about it. I just feel
ILL. Thorfinn pauses and waits for a wave of nausea to creep up on
Ivar.</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn</strong>: He used to puke in his sleep.</p>
<p><strong>ivar</strong>: Bastard. He throws up. Meanwhile Erik is in
the stern, gazing out behind them.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Thorfinn… look over there. Thorfinn leaves
Ivar and joins Erik. On the horizon a sinister sail is following them.
Thorfinn grins with evil pleasure. He scents a fight. Erik turns to the
crew.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Break out the oars! Thorfinn’s smile
disappears and he spins round to confront Erik.</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Come on, move it! Most of the men are being
sea-sick.</p>
<p><strong>mord fiddle</strong>: We’ve only just started cooking lunch.
The crew glance at Mord Fiddle and then throw up again.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Move it! Reluctantly the crew take up their
rowing positions. Thorfinn buttonholes Erik .</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn</strong>: It’s Halfdan the Black!</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: I know. Snorri! Get your oar out! Snorri is
sitting in position but without his oar. Keitel has meanwhile joined
them. He, too, stares at the horizon. He is a little puzzled by this
turn of events. Loki has said nothing about Halfdan coming after
them.</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: Do you suppose he wants to stop us waking
the Gods? Erik looks at Keitel with a certain amount of contempt. Keitel
is not renowned even amongst these Vikings for his brain-power.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: But how could he know… unless… Keitel stops
in mid-sentence as he realizes it must be Loki’s doing.</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn</strong>: So are you going to run away from him,
Erik? Erik turns to Thorfinn.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Row, Thorfinn Skull-Splitter. Thorfinn
hesitates.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: And you, Keitel Blacksmith.</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: But… Keitel shrugs and turns to take up his
rowing position. He is still a little confused by this turn of events.
Erik confronts Thorfinn.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: I gave an order. Or didn’t you hear? There is
something about Erik’s manner that carries an authority that Thorfinn
cannot argue with.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Come on, Ivar. Erik manhandles Ivar over to
his drum and thrusts his drumsticks into his hands. Halfdan’s ship is
twice the size of Erik’s and, as Erik is only too well aware,
consequently travels at twice the speed. There is no real chance of them
escaping, unless… Erik suddenly catches sight of a thick bank of mist in
the distance, and steers his ship towards it.</p>
<p><strong>ivar</strong>: I want to die… No, I don’t!</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Row! Row! Row! Ivar tries to get into the new
rhythm, but has a bit of difficult. As Halfdan’s ship gains on them
inexorably, GOLDEN DRAGON glides into the sea mist. There is a
tremendous roll of thunder very close. All the Vikings look scared.
Erik, however, grins.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Row! Row! Row! He doubles the speed. The drum
beats faster.</p>
<p><strong>sven’s dad</strong>: We can’t keep this up! Erik grins and
then leans on the steering oar. GOLDEN DRAGON curves around to its left.
Then Erik lays his hand on Ivar’s drum and silences it.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Oars up! The Vikings ship their oars and sit
there in the mist listening to beating of Halfdan’s drum getting closer
and closer. At the final moment, however, Halfdan swings his ship in the
opposite direction from Erik’s and the sound of his drum disappears into
the mist. Erik’s men breathe a sigh of relief… even Keitel Blacksmith…
Fade. Fade up some time later. GOLDEN DRAGON is still drifting in the
mist. Erik has his fish-lodestone and is trying the direction, but the
lodestone is just swinging round uselessly. After trying a few times,
Erik gives up and throws the lodestone away into the boat. The men peer
into the thick mist; they are lost. Suddenly Erik sees something
ahead.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: The Gates of the World…</p>
<p><strong>mord fiddle</strong>: What? GOLDEN DRAGON silently guides
between two weird islands.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: We have passed through the Gates of the World
No we are in the Unknown… GOLDEN DRAGON drifts on and the mist gets
thicker. There is a crash of thunder. Then a series of flashes lights up
the mist around them. The Vikings are uneasy, sensing a storm brewing.
Suddenly Erik points above them. The others look up too. They all
gasp.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: So THAT is what the sun looks like! Above them
hangs a luminous yellow globe, its light just breaking through the
mist.</p>
<p><strong>viking</strong>: The sun! It’s the sun! Look!</p>
<p><strong>sven’s dad</strong>: I never though I should live to see the
sun again.</p>
<p><strong>harald missionary</strong>: Where? The Vikings all gaze up
above them in awe. Harald looks from one to the other and then tries to
follow their eyelines. He clearly can’t see it. Magic music fills the
air. Suddenly the “sun” swoops off to one side and starts swaying from
one side to another.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Should the sun do that?</p>
<p><strong>harald missionary</strong>: What are you looking at?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Look out!</p>
<p><strong>vikings</strong>: Ah! The Vikings scream and flatten
themselves against the sides of the boat, as the “sun” suddenly lurches
down on them out of the sky, revealing for the first time that it is NOT
the sun at all but a strange monster with a long neck that disappears
off into the mist and a glowing globe for a head, and huge chomping
jaws. The Vikings are, understandably, terrified.</p>
<p><strong>vikings</strong>: It’s not the sun! It’s not the sun!</p>
<p><strong>harald missionary</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>snorri</strong>: It’s the Dragon of the North Sea!</p>
<p><strong>harald missionary</strong>: Ah! THAT’S why I can’t see it. As
the Dragon of the North Sea rises up again, however, its jaw apparently
drops off and falls to the deck, and lands on Snorri.</p>
<p><strong>snorri</strong>: Aaah! Keitel nervously picks it up and holds
it up for everyone to see. I is a strand of sea-weed. The Vikings are
non-plussed. They look back at their now jawless monster. Harald
Missionary picks up the sea-weed.</p>
<p><strong>harald</strong>: Some dragon! Ooh! He tosses it back amongst
his terrifies companions. Suddenly there is an incredibly loud clap of
thunder and flames shoot out of the mist.</p>
<p><strong>sven</strong>: Look out! As… unbelievably… a huge monstrous
visage looms out of the mist… It is a creature from the nethermost
depths of the ocean… and the incandescent globe is no more than a
sprouting on the end of its nose! More fire shoots out from its nostrils
and sends all the Vikings diving for the deck. Then the monstrous head
disappears back into the mist as quickly as it came, taking its light
with it… The Vikings are paralysed with fear for one brief moment.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Row! ROW! They all scramble for the oars in a
determined hysteria. Ivar the drummer, in his panic, has set a
ridiculously fast rate and nobody can keep up with it.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Slower! Nobody can row at that speed!</p>
<p><strong>ivar</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>harald</strong>: What’s all the panic about?</p>
<p><strong>sven’s dad</strong>: The Dragon… Harald gives a patronising
smile.</p>
<p><strong>harald</strong>: Children afraid of the dark… Suddenly there
is another roar, and flames shoot out of the mist and across the deck of
GOLDEN DRAGON. One man, Ornolf Fishdriver, who hasn’t had much to say so
far, is set on fire. Another, Bjarni Jerusalem-Farer, who has and will
have even less to say then Ornolf Fishdriver, leaps out of the way of
the flames and falls over the side.</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn</strong>: Man over board! Thorfinn starts trying to
fish him out. Ivar has started to panic and is beating the drum too
fast.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Slower! In… Out…</p>
<p><strong>ivar</strong>: Sorry!</p>
<p><strong>sven</strong>: We’re being attacked! KILL! Kill! Kill!</p>
<p><strong>sven’s dad</strong>: Not now, Sven…</p>
<p><strong>sven</strong>: I must KILL! Kill!</p>
<p><strong>sven’s dad</strong>: It’s no good going berserk against a
dragon! Sven’s dad slaps him around the face. There is another roar from
the monster. Erik turns to Ivar.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Faster!</p>
<p><strong>ivar</strong>: Make your mind up. Suddenly the Dragon’s head
appears out of the mists above them once again. There is panic amongst
the Vikings as some start to row faster than others. Screams.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Keep up the strike! The Dragon’s jaws open.
Flame licks out, and down the centre of the vessel. There are screams as
the Vikings leap out of the way. Sven goes berserk again.</p>
<p><strong>sven’s dad</strong>: Stop it! The Dragon’s eyes dilate and
its jaws open. The men throw themselves to the deck as if expecting more
fire. But instead the creature’s fangs crash into the wood of the stern
of GOLDEN DRAGON.</p>
<p><strong>sven’s dad</strong>: Shut UP!</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Row! Erik looks around at his terror-stricken
crew. He realizes this is an important moment. It is up to him to save
the situation. Suddenly an idea occurs to him, as he catches sight of
the pillow that his mother gave him.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Keep rowing! Erik dashes to his sea-chest
under the mast and pulls out the pillow.</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn</strong>: Erik! Row! What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: It saved my father! Erik starts to shin up the
mast.</p>
<p><strong>snorri</strong>: Barmy. Sven’s dad is desperately holding
Sven back.</p>
<p><strong>sven’s dad</strong>: HOLD it! HOLD it in!</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Row!</p>
<p><strong>snorri</strong>: Has anyone told him we’ve got a dragon
eating our boat? Erik has reached the top of the mast and is now right
up with the incandescent globe on the end of the long stalk that grows
onto the monster’s nose. He grabs hold of it and swings across onto the
monster’s nose. At his moment Sven breaks free of his dad and throws
himself onto one of the Dragon’s teeth.</p>
<p><strong>sven</strong>: Red mist! He bangs his head against the
monstrous denture. Sven’s dad looks heavenward in despair. Cut to Harald
Missionary who is offering his bible to the petrifies Vikings in the
prow.</p>
<p><strong>harald</strong>: It’s at time like this that you’ll find this
book MOST useful, you know… Keitel takes the bible from him and hits him
over the head with it.</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: Row! You idiot! The monster’s eyes dilate
wildly as they try to focus on the tiny figure of Erik on its snout.
Erik shoves the pillow up one of the Dragon’s nostrils. Snorri watches
Erik incredulously. He shakes his head.</p>
<p><strong>snorri</strong>: His father went crazy too… Used to take
forty winks in the middle of a battle… Thorfinn frowns - he has a
glimmering of an idea of what Erik is doing. Erik now plunges his sword
through the pillow in the Dragon’s nostril, and feathers immediately fly
into the air.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Now… take a deep breath. The Dragon goes
cross-eyed, trying to see what’s going on on its snout.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Go on! Breathe in, you cod-brain! Meanwhile
the Dragon’s tongue suddenly licks out around its tooth. Sven instantly
slices through it with his sword. The bright blood spurts, like bursting
a sausage. The Dragon gives an agonized roar and a sharp intake of
breath. The feathers that have leaked out from the pillow are instantly
sucked inside and the whole pillow disappears right up the Dragon’s
nose. For a moment everyone holds their breath. The Dragon’s eye dilate
wildly. Then it wrinkles its snout. Then it starts what is unmistakably
a sneeze.</p>
<p><strong>the dragon of the north sea</strong>: Ah… ah… ah…</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Hold TIGHT!</p>
<p><strong>the dragon of the north sea</strong>: Ah… ah… ah… Erik leaps
back across the mast.</p>
<p><strong>choo!!</strong>: A hurricane of wind and feathers blasts out
of the Dragon’s nostrils and hits all the Vikings at once. Everyone is
disgusted by the Dragon’s breath.</p>
<p><strong>snorri</strong>: Urgh! What’s it been eating? But the blast
has already catapulted the boat into the sky, and it hurtles through the
clouds. leaving the Dragon of the North Sea far behind. They all look up
at Erik and cheer. Shot of Erik. He doesn’t look too happy. Neither does
Ivar the Boneless, because he too has just noticed that they are now
flying and the ocean is several thousand feet below them. Ivar screams.
The other all rush to the side to look too.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: No! No! Get back! Unfortunately they all rush
to the SAME side and the boat tips over with far more instability than
when it is in the water. Leif and Thangbrand are catapulted down into
the sea. We watch them descend into tiny dots and tiny unheard splashes
below.</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn</strong>: Who was that?</p>
<p><strong>snorri</strong>: Leif the Lucky. Others are almost falling
out. There is renewed panic.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Get back! Poor Erik is still up the mast but
has been dislodged and is now hanging on by his hands, dangling over the
open sea. Some of the men - Thorfinn and Sven the Berserk amongst them -
are hauling themselves up the almost vertical slope of the deck, trying
to redress the balance. Meanwhile Keitel Blacksmith is dangling by one
hand.</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: I can’t hold on! I can’t hold on! Sven worms
his way along the edge - at great peril to himself - and grabs Keitel’s
wrist just as his fingers slip.</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: Aaagh!</p>
<p><strong>sven</strong>: Got you! Keitel looks up in Sven’s eyes. He is
totally at Sven’s mercy. What thoughts are going through his mind? How
is he going to betray Sven in future if he is rescued? Guilt suddenly
overwhelms him.</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: Let me go, Sven.</p>
<p><strong>sven</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: I’m not worth risking your life for.</p>
<p><strong>sven</strong>: I’ve got you, Keitel Blacksmith. If you go… I
go too…</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: For your own sake… For the others… I…</p>
<p><strong>sven</strong>: Hang on… The boat begins to right itself just
as Erik finally can’t hold on any more, and he plummets, straight into
the ship, and through the bottom up to his waist. His legs dangle. At
the same moment the prov of the boat tips and suddenly they are
plummeting down towards the ocean. They hit the water with an almighty
splash. Erik is thrown clear of the hull by the force of the water now
cascading up through the hole he has made.</p>
<p><strong>snorri</strong>: First we’re flying - now we’re sinking!</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Well, come on! He whisks off his helmet and
starts bailing. All follow suit. Night falls. Some time later. The
Vikings are still bailing out, but the water is up to their thighs.</p>
<p><strong>ivar the boneless</strong>: Who are we fooling? It’s
hopeless! Ivar flings down the helmet with which he’s been bailing. The
others look at each other. They are reconciled to the fact that they are
going to drown.</p>
<p><strong>harald missionary</strong>: Let’s sing something!</p>
<p><strong>snorri</strong>: Anyone know any good drowning songs? The
suggestion falls flat.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Listen! Maybe we won’t get to Hy-Brasil! Maybe
we won’t find the Horn Resounding… but at least we’ve tried… and at
least we shall have died like men.</p>
<p><strong>snorri</strong>: Like fish.</p>
<p><strong>sven</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn</strong>: Erik’s right! We’ll all meet in
Valhalla.</p>
<p><strong>ivar</strong>: I don’T want to die!</p>
<p><strong>harald missionary</strong>: Isn’t there ANYBODY who’d like to
be christened before we go down? Silence. A distinct lack of
enthusiasm.</p>
<p><strong>harald</strong>: It can’t do you any HARM…</p>
<p><strong>sven’s dad</strong>: What do we have to do?</p>
<p><strong>harald</strong>: Nothing… I just immerse you in water…</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn and others</strong>: Get lost… The ship creaks and
starts to go under. Erik picks his up his sword. The others follow
suit.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Don’t let me drown, Thorfinn! Water starts to
pour over the sides of the boat. Erik and Thorfinn raise their swords to
each other.</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn</strong>: Till we meet in Valhalla. They all prepare
to run each other through. The boat sinks rapidly.</p>
<p><strong>ivar the boneless</strong>: I’m too young! Oh Odin! Not me!
Please not me! Perhaps I’d rather drown…</p>
<p><strong>harald missionary</strong>: I do WISH you’d let me convert
you. Then Erik pauses in his attempt to kill Thorfinn and looks around.
The ship has sunk, but the prow and the stern posts are still sticking
up out of the water, and the Vikings themselves are only up to their
chests.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: How deep IS the ocean?</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn</strong>: Very deep… usually… The realization
gradually dawns on the Vikings that they’re not going to sink any
more.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Wait! Nobody kill anybody! Fade. Fade up on
the sun shining down from a blue sky. The Vikings have fallen asleep
where we last saw them - up to their necks in water. Gradually the
warmth of the sun coaxes them awake - Thorfinn is the first to look up
and see the brilliant shining orb in the sky.</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>ivar the boneless</strong>: It’s the Dragon again!</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: No.. no, it isn’t… Ivar has turned and is
staring at something else.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Look, the sky is blue…</p>
<p><strong>sven’s dad</strong>: The sun! That’s it! Ivar, meanwhile, is
recovering from the amazement that has immobilized him. He taps Erik on
the shoulder. Erik turns and he, too, gasps.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Look! They all turn to see they are standing
in the shallow waters of a natural harbour. Above nestle the white walls
of a beautiful city set in a green and pleasant land.</p>
<p><strong>vikings</strong>: Yeaaaah! The Vikings wade ashore, enchanted
by the paradise they see before them. All at once Thorfinn spies
something. He draws his sword and they all approach with caution to find
that under a weeping willow tree lies the most beautiful girl. She is
raven-haired, scantily dressed and fast asleep. The Vikings approach her
with trepidation, their swords and axes drawn. They glance around
uneasily.</p>
<p><strong>snorri</strong>: She’s got no clothes on!</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn</strong>: It’s disgusting.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Get her weapons. Sven kneels quietly beside
the girl. She stirs. Sven freezes. The others look around fearfully.</p>
<p><strong>sven</strong>: She hasn’t got any.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: She MUST have a knife or something… But they
look. She hasn’t.</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn</strong>: What kind of place IS this?</p>
<p><strong>ivar the boneless</strong>: P… p…perhaps they’ve got weapons
we haven’t even dreamed of… Suddenly the girl stirs again in her sleep.
The Vikings retreat several paces and grip their weapons, and glance
around as if expecting an ambush.</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn</strong>: Let’s hack her to pieces.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: Well, what else do we do?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: How about making friends?</p>
<p><strong>vikings</strong>: Eurrgh!</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: What’s wrong with making friends?</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn</strong>: You don’t go through all the hardships of
an ocean voyage to make “friends”.</p>
<p><strong>sven</strong>: We can make “friends” at home… This
conversation has woken the girl, Aud.</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: Welcome! The Vikings react with terror, take a
step back and raise their swords and axes.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: WHAT did you say?</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: I said welcome.</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: Well, of course. We always welcome friends. The
Vikings look at each other and at their swords. They don’t think they
look that much like friends themselves.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: How d’you KNOW we’re “friends”?</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: Well, EVERYONE is friends here on
Hy-Brasil.</p>
<p><strong>sven</strong>: Hy-Brasil?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Is THIS Hy-Brasil?</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: Well, of course. The Vikings erupt into an
impromptu dance of joy, hugging each other and waving their swords in
the air.</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: Please! Please! What are those?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: What are what?</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: Those things in your hands.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: These? What are THESE? They’re swords. Aud
instantly recoils with terror.</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: Oh no! NO! Out them down! PUT THEM DOWN! The
Vikings gradually cease their mock battles and turn to look at Aud with
incredulity.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: PLEASE! You don’t know what you’re doing!</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: Put them down! PLEASE make them put them
down.</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>others</strong>: Yes, why?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: But surely you know…?</p>
<p><strong>vikings</strong>: Er… n… no…</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Know what? Cut to big close-up of King
Arnulf.</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: The wonderful blessing under which we
live here on Hy-Brasil! The king beams. The Vikings shift uneasily. They
look out of place and extremely scruffy in the midst of the scantily
dressed courtiers of Hy-Brasil. Aud sits beside her father the King.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: No… we don’t…</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: The Gods decreed that if ever sword
spills human blood upon these shores, the whole of Hy-Brasil will sink
beneath the waves. King Arnulf beams rapturously at the Vikings,
expecting them to be overjoyed. Instead they are horrified.</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn</strong>: That’s terrible!</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: You mean if just ONE PERSON gets killed?</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: Yes! The Vikings look at each other,
feeling they haven’t quite understood.</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn</strong>: You mean… you can’t kill ANYBODY?</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: Right! Isn’t it wonderful? The Vikings
are non-plussed.</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn</strong>: What? Not being able to kill anybody?</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: Well, of course.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: Well… for a start… er… there’s no
killing…</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Well, OBVIOUSLY there’s no killing.</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn</strong>: But how d’you take revenge?</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: How do you punish people?</p>
<p><strong>ivar</strong>: How do you DEFEND yourselves?</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: We don’t have to. We’re all terribly
nice to each other. Aren’t we?</p>
<p><strong>court</strong>: Yes! Aud catches Erik’s eye and gives him a
dangerously slow wink. A pause of disbelief from the Vikings.</p>
<p><strong>sven</strong>: ALL the time?</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: Well, of course! We HAVE to be. He
turns and conducts the courtiers, who chant in unison:</p>
<p><strong>court</strong>: “Being nice to each other is what it’s all
about.”</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: You see? We’re terribly nice to each
other We’re friendly bold and free. We never say anything nasty ’Cause
we dare not…</p>
<p><strong>court</strong>: No sirreeeee! They hold the note while King
Arnulf looks anxiously at the Vikings.</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: Would you like us o sing to you?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: That’s very kind of you, but we’re in rather a
hurry… We’re… King Arnulf claps and the court stop singing.</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: What’s the matter, don’t you WANT to
hear our singing?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Oh… well, yes, of course; it’s just we’re
looking for the Horn Resounding and -</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: You don’t think our singing’s going to
be good enough for you?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Oh, no no no! It’s just the Horn Resounding
is…</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: A lot of people like our singing.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: I’m sure it’s lovely.</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: But you don’t want to hear it.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: No… no… We’d love to hear it. Wouldn’t we?</p>
<p><strong>vikings</strong>: Oh… yes.</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: Well, you’ll have to ask us REALLY
nicely.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Er… well… we… we… would be TERRIBLY grateful
if you… all… would sing for us.</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: You’re just saying that.</p>
<p><strong>sven</strong>: Well, of course he is!</p>
<p><strong>sven’s dad</strong>: Sh! They restrain Sven.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Of course we’re not; we’d genuinely like to
hear you sing.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Really.</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: And you’re not just saying it because
you think we want you to? Erik swallows hard.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: Right! Summon the musicians! We’ll do
the one that goes “TUM-</p>
<p><strong>court</strong>: Oh…</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: It isn’t the one we’re BEST at.</p>
<p><strong>chamberlain</strong>: Couldn’t we do the one that goes
“TI-TUM-TI-TUM-TI-TUM”? The rest of the court look hopeful.</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: Not when we’ve got guests.</p>
<p><strong>voice from court</strong>: How about the one that goes
“TI-TUM-TI-TUM-TI-TUM-TI-TI-TUM”?</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: Don’t be silly.</p>
<p><strong>chamberlain</strong>: That was a stupid suggestion.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Sorry! I just thought they might like to hear
something that we can do.</p>
<p><strong>another</strong>: Yes! At least we know that one.</p>
<p><strong>yet another voice</strong>: Nobody knows the
“TUM-TUM-TUM-TUM-TI-TUM-TUM” one.</p>
<p><strong>rest of court</strong>: No! Right! I agree!</p>
<p><strong>odd man out</strong>: I do!</p>
<p><strong>rest of court</strong>: Sh!</p>
<p><strong>another voice</strong>: It’s too difficult!</p>
<p><strong>chamberlain</strong>: Sh!</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: All right. We’ll do the one that goes
“TI-TUM-TI-TUM-TI-TUM- TI-TI-TUM”. Ah! The musicians! The musicians are
huge, unshaven, have broken noses and tattoos, and are covered in black
oil - like mechanics. Their instruments are like heavy industrial
machinery, pushed in large vats of black oil that drip all over the
show.</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: Right… Oh dear… I’m sure you’re not
going to like this… Erik and the others smile reassuringly. There is a
lot of coughing. The King raises his baton and then brings it down,
humming to himself as he does so. There is a most awful din;
caterwauling, crashing and banging, whining, screaming… The Vikings look
at each other, trying to pick out some tune, but it’s impossible. Ivar
the Boneless can’t stop himself bursting out into giggles and this
eventually spreads to the other Vikings. King Arnulf notices and bangs
the throne for silence. Gradually the din stops. King Arnulf sinks down
in despair.</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: We’re just not a very musical
nation…</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: No, no… It was very… er, nice.</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: Now I want you to be ABSOLUTELY,
totally, genuinely honest with me. Did you really, truly, honestly like
it? Erik thinks for some moments and then decides to make a clean breast
of it.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: They didn’t like it! Oh God! I want to
die! The whole court looks as if it’s about to commit mass HARA-KIRI,
while the musicians look rather dangerous. Erik takes the moment to get
down to business.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Your Majesty! We come from a world where there
IS no music. where men live and die by the axe and by the sword…</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: Well, how d’you think I feel?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: The Gods are asleep, King Arnulf.</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: YOU try to be nice to people, when
they’re rude about your singing… Erik feels he is making a mess of all
this diplomacy.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: We must find the Horn Resounding! The King
glares at Erik.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Is is HERE in Hy-Brasil? King Arnulf thinks
for a moment and then speaks.</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: I’ll tell you what…</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Yes? King Arnulf hesitates - he bites his lip
and then takes the plunge.</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: We’ll do the one that goes
“TUM-TUM-TUM-TUM-TI-TUM-TUM”. Perhaps you’ll like that better. Erik
gives up. A lot of throat clearing. Aud, the King’s daughter, gives Erik
another dangerously slow wink. The terrible “music” starts up,
shattering the calm of the beautiful city. Fade. Fade up on GOLDEN
DRAGON now afloat once more, riding at anchor in the bay. Ivar is
standing on guard in it. Suddenly he sees something that makes him gabe
in horror. We don’t find out what it is, however, because we immediately
Cut to Erik. He is deeply in love. He is also in bed with the King’s
nubile daughter, Aud.</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: Have you ever felt like this about anyone
else?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: What… you mean “got into bed with” them?</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: No, of course not, silly - I mean FELT like
this about the?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: You mean… you HAVE got into bed with somebody
else?</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: No, I mean have you ever felt that for the
first time in your life you’d met somebody you could believe in with
your whole heart… someone whose goals suddenly seem to be YOUR goals…
whose dreams seem to be YOUR dreams?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: HAVE you ever been to bed with anyone
else?</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: What does that matter? But you’ve… you’ve… FELT
like this before…</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: It was different…</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: What was she like?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Oh… oh, I didn’t know her very well…</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: But you LOVED her all the same…</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: We never went to bed together.</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: Why do you go on about that? What does it
matter?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: You’ve been to bed with somebody else, haven’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: I’ve never LOVED anybody!</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: I’VE never been to bed with anybody! Suddenly
there is a banging on he door.</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: Open up! I know you’re in there!</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: Ah! It’s my father! KING ARNULF Open up! I know
you’re in there! Suddenly the note from Ivar’s horn rings out across
from the bay. Erik rushes to the window and looks out to see what Ivar
saw previously: a black ship approaching on the horizon.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Oh, no! Halfdan! There is more banging on the
bedroom door. KING ARNULF Aud! You’ve got someone in there again,
haven’t you? Erik gives her a sharp look.</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: Quick! Throw this over you! She throws a shabby
bit of cloth over Erik and at that moment the door bursts open, and King
Arnulf enters.</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: Right! Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: Who, Father?</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: Who? Who? Whoever you’ve got in here of
course!</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: There IS no one. The King starts prowling round
the chamber. Erik stands there, naked and petrified, with the cloak
hanging over his head, just where it landed.</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: I can SMELL one of those strangers…
That’s who it is, isn’t it? Aud keeps mum.</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: This is the fifth one this week. Before
he can stop himself, Erik blurts out:</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Fifth… Aud motions him to be quiet, but it’s
too late. The King spins round to see who she is signalling to. The King
appears to be looking straight at Erik. Erik can hardly bear the
suspense.</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: Well… where is he?</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: There’s nobody here, Father. Look for yourself.
King Arnulf looks around the chamber carefully. He looks straight
through Erik as if he weren’t there. Suddenly the King strides over to
Erik and Erik instinctively cowers out of the way. The King walks
straight over to a very small cupboard no more than a foot high, flings
the door of it open, and starts throwing clothes around the room.</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: He wouldn’t be a midget, Father! The King turns
on her.</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: Ah! So you admit there IS someone!</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: You’re losing your temper!</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: Of course I’m not. I never lose my temper…
Ivar’s horn sounds again. A shadow passes over King Arnulf’s face.</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: Oh dear… more visitors! He strides to
the window and sees Halfdan’s ship. As he does so, Erik has to leap out
of the way, inadvertently knocking a chest. The King spins round and
addresses the chest.</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: Come out… come out like a man… I know
you’re in there… King Arnulf flings the chest open. revealing nothing
but clothes. He is baffled. He reluctantly starts to leave.</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: It’s all in your own mind, Father… It’s YOU who
imagine that I’m always up here with some man or other….</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: I don’t know how you do it, Aud… I
sometimes think you’ve got some of your mother’s magic… He suddenly
spies a small trinket-box and looks in that. But he doesn’t find any
strange man in it.</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: There is no magic, Father… My mother had no
magic…</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: She did, I tell you! She could blind me
as easily as the night the day.</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: It’s your fantasy…</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: But one day I’ll catch you… Like I
caught her… He leaves. Aud closes the door. Erik throws the cloak off
and starts getting dressed.</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: The Cloak Invisible. It was my mother’s parting
gift.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: “The fifth one this week”!</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: Oh, for goodness’ sake!</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: And I thought you said it was something
special… Aud runs to his side and puts her arms around him.</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: That’s just what I was trying to tell you. You
ARE…</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Five this week; how many the week before?</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: You’re as bad as my father.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: And the week before that?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Erik…! I want to help you get to Asgaard. Erik
is torn. He doesn’t know whether to believe her or not. Ivar’s horn
sounds for a third time. Erik races to the window. He looks out.
Halfdan’s ship is even closer.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: We mustn’t let him land!</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Halfdan the Black.</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: But, Erik… But Erik is off out of the door.</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: No. Wait! My father will be - There is a thump
and a yell as Erik is set upon by the King’s two musicians.</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: I might have known it was you!</p>
<p><strong>musician 1</strong>: I’m not hurting you, am I?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>musician 2</strong>: You WILL tell us if we hurt you? They
start to march Erik through the palace.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Let me go! Erik struggles.</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: Careful! They’re not supposed to hurt
you.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: You’ve got to let me go!</p>
<p><strong>musician 2</strong>: Oh no! We can hold onto you - just so
long we don’t squeeze too hard or bump you. In the distance we hear the
horn again.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Halfdan the Black’s here! They have reached a
cell. The musicians starts to chain Erik up.</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: It’s all part of our safety
regulations. You see if someone were to get hurt they might get angry
and then… well…</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: They’ll be more than “hurt” if Halfdan the
Black lands! Ow!</p>
<p><strong>musician</strong>: Ooh! I’m terribly sorry.</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: Who is Halfdan the Black?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: He’s trying to stop us waking the Gods.</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Because that’s how he makes his money, by war
and plunder!</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: Don’t talk nonsense.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: He wants to kill US!</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: Not when we explain about the Great
Blessing.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: You don’t know Halfdan the Black.</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: I know that the Great Blessing has kept
the peace for a thousand years, and will keep it for the next thousand.
The horn sounds again. Erik is about to argue this point when Thorfinn
suddenly bursts in.</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn</strong>: Erik!</p>
<p><strong>musician 2</strong>: We’re not hurting him!</p>
<p><strong>musician 1</strong>: Are we?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Just let me go!</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn</strong>: Halfdan the Black’s here!</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: I know!</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn</strong>: He wants to KILL us. They both look at
King Arnulf. The King thinks.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: You don’t want him to kill us ON Hy-Brasil! Do
you? The King thinks some more. The horn sounds once more. Cut to GOLDEN
DRAGON. Erik and the Vikings are scrambling into their war gear. They
glance nervously over to where Halfdan the Black’s ship is riding on the
waves.</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn</strong>: I feel strange. Erik looks at Thorfinn,
shocked.</p>
<p><strong>ivar the boneless</strong>: Sort of wobbly and excited?</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn</strong>: Sort of…</p>
<p><strong>ivar</strong>: That’s fear.</p>
<p><strong>sven</strong>: But Thorfinn doesn’t know the meaning of
fear.</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn</strong>: Is it sort of… like a sinking feeling in
your stomach?</p>
<p><strong>ivar</strong>: That’s it!</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: But. You’re not even afraid of DEATH,
Thorfinn!</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn</strong>: I know. I know.</p>
<p><strong>sven’s dad</strong>: It’s magic.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: What “magic”?</p>
<p><strong>sven’s dad</strong>: I’ve heard stories of a magic that
strikes fear into the heart so you cannot fight.</p>
<p><strong>sven</strong>: Yes… I can feel it.</p>
<p><strong>ivar the boneless</strong>: I always feel like this! Suddenly
Halfdan’s ship rises up out of the water , and revealing the secret of
its hidden power. Under the water-line is another line of oars! The
Vikings are dumbfounded. Ivar drops trembling to his knees. The rest go
white. Thorfinn draws his sword. Erik realizes his men are rapidly
talking themselves into a blue funk.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: It’s not magic! It’s just a trick!</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn</strong>: Don’t you FEEL it? Erik looks around at
his paralysed crew. He realizes he is the only one who can save the
situation.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Very well! It they’re using magic - we’ll use
magic of our own! He leaps out of GOLDEN DRAGON and races up to the
shore towards the city of Hy-Brasil. Erik races into the Forum and gazes
up at the high walls of the Palace. Without a thought he produces two
daggers and plunges them into the stonework. Then he hauls himself up
the sheer cliff of wall up to Aud’s bedchamber fist over fist. It is,
indeed, a prodigious feat. He arrives at Aud’s window exhausted. Aud,
who has appeared at the window, looks at him curiously.</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: Why didn’t you come up by the stairs? Erik
looks around and notices for the first time the magnificent flights of
stairs leading up to the top of Aud’s tower.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Just give me a hand.</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: I mean, you could have killed yourself. Erik
clambers into Aud’s room.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Where’s the Cloak Invisible?</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: Why? Erik looks around and is suddenly
suspicious.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: I can’t see it! Have you got another man in
here? Erik starts feeling the air as if expecting to find an invisible
body.</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: It’s in the chest. Erik races over and grabs
the cloak.</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: I’ll bring it back.</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: Erik. You don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: No. It’s YOU who doesn’t understand, Aud.
Halfdan has come to kill and destroy. We brought him here. We must stop
him.</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: But you don’t realize….</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Goodbye, Aud… Erik leaps out of the window.
For a moment Aud is surprised and then alarmed as she realizes he’s
jumped out of the window, which is some forty feet off the ground.</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: Erik! She rushes to the window in time to see
Erik parachuting down, holding the four corners of the cloak. Erik lands
safely and waves with the cloak.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: And thanks for the Cloak Invisible!</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: No! WAIT! ERIK! The Cloak! The CLoak Invisible!
It only seems to work on my father! But Erik cannot hear her. He is
already racing back to his ship. Back on GOLDEN DRAGON, Thorfinn is
taking “Being Scared” lessons from Ivar the Boneless.</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn</strong>: And a sort of slightly sick feeling?</p>
<p><strong>ivar</strong>: That’s it! AND you keep wanting to go to the
lavatory.</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn</strong>: Oh, yes! I hadn’t noticed that!</p>
<p><strong>snorri</strong>: Oh, shut up, you two. You’re making us ALL
nervous. Erik leaps into GOLDEN DRAGON brandishing the Cloak
Invisible.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: So Halfdan the Black’s using magic, is he?
Well, I have a magic to match his!</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>snorri</strong>: A magic dishcloth.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: To the oars!</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn</strong>: D’you think I’ve got time to go behind
that bush? Ivar starts to drum and the Vikings begin to row. GOLDEN
DRAGON heads out of the harbour. Cut to Halfdan the Black flanked by his
advisers, Gisli Oddsson and Eilif the Mongul. He gives a nod and Eilif
bangs his staff of office on the deck, as a signal for the galley slaves
to speed up. Down in the galley, the slave master stalks down the decks
lashing the sweat-streaked galley slaves and cursing them in
incomprehensive Japanese. Fortunately a translation appears in
subtitles.</p>
<p><strong>slave-driver</strong>: Row! You incomprehensible,
horizontal-eyed, Western trouser-wearers! Eurgh! You all look the same
to me! How I despise your lack of subtlety and your joined-up writing!
You, who have never committed ritual suicide in your lives!</p>
<p><strong>slave</strong>: You know, I don’t think it would be so bad,
if we knew what he was saying…</p>
<p><strong>slave-driver</strong>: SILENCE! Unceremonious rice-pudding
eaters! How I abominate your milk-drinking and your lack of
ancestor-worship and your failure to eat your lunch out of little boxes!
Meanwhile the Vikings are growing increasingly uneasy as they row
towards Halfdan.</p>
<p><strong>sven’s dad</strong>: What “magic” have you brought, Erik?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: You’ll see! At this point, back on the Black
Ship, Halfdan gives another nod and Eilif raps out yet another command
with his staff. This time the prow of the Black Ship opens up like a
pair of jaws. The Vikings see it and panic.</p>
<p><strong>ivar the boneless</strong>: I’ve done it!</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn</strong>: Oh, yes… Halfdan nods again and another
order is rapped out. This time a harpoon is fired from the prow. It
thuds into gOLDEN DRAGON and two of Halfdan’s dog-soldiers start to
winch the line in. The two ships are hauled closer and closer. The
Vikings panic even more. Erik holds up the Cloak Invisible and grins
round at his men, knowing he is going to surprise them.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Here! Here is the magic from the King’s
daughter! Erik’s men watch, half sceptical and half hopeful. Erik enjoys
the moment of suspense. The he throws the Cloak Invisible over his head
and shoulders and grins round at his men triumphantly, imagining he has
vanished from their sight.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: There! I have become the wind! The Vikings
look at him, rather puzzled. Only Harald seems to be impressed.</p>
<p><strong>harald</strong>: How did he do that?</p>
<p><strong>sven’s dad</strong>: Do what?</p>
<p><strong>harald</strong>: Vanish into thin air?</p>
<p><strong>sven’s dad</strong>: He hasn’t.</p>
<p><strong>harald</strong>: Well, where is he then? Harald looks around.
He is the only one who can’t see Erik.</p>
<p><strong>sven’s dad</strong>: He’s THERE! At this point Halfdan’s ship
suddenly bites into the side of GOLDEN DRAGON. Erik leaps onto the side
of GOLDEN DRAGON and swings across onto Halfdan’s ship. The Vikings
react to the horror of Halfdan’s ship biting into GOLDEN DRAGON and to
Erik’s blithe leap onto the enemy boat. Erik lands on the deck of
Halfdan’s ship, and grins at the ferocious skull-helmeted
dog-soldiers.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Ooh! Scary! Scary! Don’t we look mean? Two
dog-soldiers look at each other, totally non-plussed. Erik grimaces at
Halfdan’s men, and does a little pirouette to show them all that he’s
invisible from every angle.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: You can’t see me! But I can see you! He breaks
into a little dance. Halfdan glares at his advisers.</p>
<p><strong>halfdan</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>gisli oddsson</strong>: That’s Erik.</p>
<p><strong>halfdan</strong>: Well, why isn’t he scared of us? Erik,
meanwhile approaches one of the dog-soldiers and makes silly faces at
him.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Boo! The dog-soldier topples overboard. The
galley slaves watch another dog-soldier fall into the hold amongst them
and lie there stunned. His sword falls onto the deck between the slaves.
One of the slaves throws down his oar, and picks up the dog-soldier’s
sword. The slave-master suddenly appears. Once again he speaks
immaculate JApanese.</p>
<p><strong>slave-master</strong>: Hey! What’s going on? Your
big-breasted women give me no pleasure with their warmed-up fish and…
Urgh! The slave-master strides down the ship to flay the offending
slave, but another slave trips him up and in a twinkling of an eye four
others have leapt on the slave-master and are extracting his keys.</p>
<p><strong>halfdan</strong>: What’s the matter? Haven’t you seen anyone
fight before?</p>
<p><strong>dog-soldier 1</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>dog-soldier 2</strong>: They’re usually too scared of us.</p>
<p><strong>halfdan</strong>: KILL him! Erik, still thinking he’s
invisible, is running amongst the dog- soldiers, having fun. He runs one
dog-soldier through and kicks another overboard, then he runs past a few
more, right up to Halfdan himself. He whisks the Cloak Invisible off his
head for an instant.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Here I am! Then he turns and is off. Halfdan
turns to his aides.</p>
<p><strong>halfdan</strong>: What? Back on GOLDEN DRAGON, the Vikings’
disbelief has turned to admiration.</p>
<p><strong>sven’s dad</strong>: There! THAT’S a true Berserk.</p>
<p><strong>sven</strong>: I’m just building up to it, Dad. Sven starts
banging his head on the side of the boat.</p>
<p><strong>snorri</strong>: He’s gone batty!</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn</strong>: No! The fear’s gone! Halfdan grabs a sword
off one of his dead dog-soldiers and thrusts it into the unwilling hands
of his military adviser, Eilif.</p>
<p><strong>halfdan</strong>: Fight, damn you! Fight! Cut back to GOLDEN
DRAGON. Now Sven leaps across onto Halfdan’s ship followed by Ivar,
yelling. Snorri looks back at Keitel.</p>
<p><strong>snorri</strong>: Well! Come on!</p>
<p><strong>i… i…</strong>: Keitel is thinking: “Maybe I should let
Halfdan win” but he knows he can’t let a thing like that happen, now he
is faced with the reality of it. The companionship of the voyage has
brought them all too close for that.</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: Hang the Blacksmith’s Code! Keitel leaps to
his feet and joins in the attack. Erik, meanwhile, is swinging across
the deck from a rope.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: I am the air! I am the wind! Keitel and
Thorfinn are now fighting side by side.</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn</strong>: This is life, eh? Keitel grins and strikes
out. Ivar turns on Eilif who has reluctantly joined the fray. Maybe he’s
singled Ivar out as the most harmless. Ivar suddenly realizes he’s only
armed with drumsticks. Eilif smiles evilly.</p>
<p><strong>ivar</strong>: Ooh… er… Eilif’s sword slices through Ivar’s
drumsticks. Ivar turns to run, but is stopped by a dog-soldier. Eilif
takes the opportunity to run him through from behind.</p>
<p><strong>ivar</strong>: Ouch. Erik sees Ivar’s demise.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Ivar! Erik leaps to take revenge. He jumps
into the galley-pit and out again a la Douglas Fairbanks in THE THIEF OF
BAGHDAD and dispatches Eilif with a single thrust. Sven and his dad are
fighting surrounded by dog- soldiers.</p>
<p><strong>sven’s dad</strong>: Well, go on! Go berserk!</p>
<p><strong>sven</strong>: GIVE US A CHANCE, Dad! Snorri appears from
behind.</p>
<p><strong>snorri</strong>: What about you? Why don’t YOU go
berserk?</p>
<p><strong>sven’s dad</strong>: I got to keep my eye on HIM… Sven’s dad
looks uneasy. He is surrounded and, as a seasoned campaigner, knows they
haven’t much chance. Halfdan smiles to himself. The battle is going his
way. Thorfinn meanwhile is fighting two dog- soldiers but is attacked
from behind by a third.</p>
<p><strong>sven</strong>: Look out! Thorfinn! But it’s too late.
Thorfinn is run through the back. Sven goes berserk and kills all three
dog-soldiers. Sven’s dad looks on, proud of his son for the first time.
Maybe their relationship will never be the same again. Now Snorri sees
something that cheers him up. SLaves are coming up from below to join
the battle. They are armed with oars and swords. They join the fray,
knocking dog-soldiers overboard with their oars. The dog-soldier are
suddenly outnumbered. Halfdan’s smile fades, and he looks around for an
escape route. The tide of battle has now turned dramatically as
dog-soldier after dog-soldier is tossed over the side or laid low by the
combination of Vikings and slaves. Halfdan and Gisli slip into a
lifeboat and sneak off. The rats are leaving the sinking ship. Back on
the deck, all the dog-soldiers are dead or overboard. The slaves and
Vikings are cheering and embracing each other. At the other end of the
boat, Sven is cradling the dying Thorfinn in his arms. All around are
jubilant slaves celebrating their freedom.</p>
<p><strong>sven</strong>: Thorfinn! You can’t die!</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn</strong>: I’m not frightened… of anything…</p>
<p><strong>sven</strong>: You’ll see my grandfather in Valhalla!</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn</strong>: No… he’s not… not… there…</p>
<p><strong>sven</strong>: Tell him I’m coming! Thorfinn dies. Sven holds
him and a tear comes down his face. The danger has made comrades of the
two rivals. Erik, however, is still fighting a last lone dog-soldier;
but just as he is about to run him through the dog-soldier is stabbed in
the back. He sinks to the floor, revealing another dog-soldier. Erik is
outraged by this act of treachery and turns on the assassin.</p>
<p><strong>dog-soldier</strong>: No! No” Wait! Please wait, Erik! The
dog-soldier pulls his mask off to reveal he is, in fact, Loki. Erik is
totally non-plussed.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: LOKI! Where did YOU come from?</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Halfdan wanted to stop you waking the Gods…
so… I disguised myself to sabotage their plans. Erik has meanwhile been
joined by the remaining comrades.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: To save YOU, Erik. Erik is about to say “But
how can you see me? I’m wearing the Cloak Invisible.”</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: But -</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: It was my master Keitel’s idea. All eyes turn
on Keitel who looks very uncomfortable.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Wasn’t it, Keitel?</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: Well… I… I thought… Keitel is overcome b the
power of Loki’s will, but he is deeply ashamed of his complicity in
Loki’s deeds. Snorri gazes at Keitel with growing suspicion.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: But… How is it you can see me? You can all see
me?</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: What d’you mean?</p>
<p><strong>snorri and others</strong>: Why shouldn’t we see you?</p>
<p><strong>harald</strong>: I can’t see him.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: I’m wearing the Cloak Invisible…. Erik takes
it off to demonstrate.</p>
<p><strong>harald</strong>: Oh! There you are!</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: You mean… you could see me all the time? The
Vikings look at each other, mystified.</p>
<p><strong>snorri</strong>: Weren’t we supposed to?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Oh… I feel a little… oh… Erik’s knees give way
and he faints onto the deck. Cut to King’s Hall some time later. A
victory celebration is in progress. It is a little bit like a Hampstead
cocktail party, and the rough, battle-stained Vikings look rather out of
place holding their little canapes. Suddenly the King claps for
silence.</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: We are grateful to you, Erik, and to
your men…</p>
<p><strong>court</strong>: Yes, we are…</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: And there is only ONE way we can repay
you… Musicians! King arnulf claps his hands. Erik rushes over to him,
anxious to avoid another Hy-Brasilian concert.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Well, we’d love to hear you sing again, but
what we’d really appreciate would be if you could see your way to
lending… not giving of course… … but just lending us the…. um… the,
well, to be quite blunt… the Horn Resounding. All the time Erik is
talking the doors of the hall behind are opening and a vast lur or horn
is carried in by six bearers. One or two of the Vikings have turned to
look and are now standing speechless. King Arnulf beams at Erik.</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: It’s yours. Now Erik finally turns and
looks at what everyone else is looking at. Erik’s jaw drops. Everyone in
the court beams at Erik,except Aud who is looking sad and
disappointed.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Is THAT it? A cloud passes over King Arnulf’s
happy face.</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: Is there something the matter with
it?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Oh! No! No… of course not… it’s just I hadn’t
expected it to be quite so big.</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: Well, it’s not called the Horn
Resounding for nothing. You DO know how to play the horn, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Yes… oh, yes…</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: Then I expect you’ll be leaving first
thing in the morning. The King manhandles Erik away from his daughter.
Perhaps we have the feeling that she’s isn’t going to let Erik go as
easily as that…Mix through to later that night. The Vikings are lying
asleep on the Great Hall, beside the Horn Resounding. The camera closes
in on Keitel. Suddenly a voice comes from the shadows:</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Keitel! Keitel Blacksmith! Keitel opens his
eyes and finds Loki close beside him.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: What’s the matter, Keitel Blacksmith? Have you
forgotten why you came on this voyage? Keitel is silent.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Are you going to let Erik wake the Gods?</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: How can we stops him now? Loki looks around
and then opens his hand in front of Keitel. In it is the mouthpiece from
the Horn Resounding.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Take this and throw it from the cliff heights.
They’ll never make the Horn Resounding sound without it. Keitel frowns.
Then an obvious thought limps across his muscular mind.</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: But why me? Why don’t you do it? Somebody
stirs.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Sh! Hurry!</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: YOU do it!</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: You’ll be able to throw it further than I
could. Keitel thinks. This is true.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: It must go far out to sea. Loki presses the
mouthpiece on Keitel. Keitel takes it, but reluctantly. Another Viking
stirs.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Surely you haven’t forgotten the Blacksmith’s
Oath? Keitel is about to reply and say he’s been having second thoughts
about it, but somehow he can’t. Loki has such power over him.</p>
<p><strong>i…</strong>: Suddenly another Viking stirs, and Loki hisses
at him.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Hurry! Loki pretend to go back to sleep.
Keitel thinks about his task and hesitates… Who knows? Perhaps he is
about to stand firm, but Loki plays his trump card.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Or I might have to tell Erik why you really
came on this voyage. Keitel is caught. He closes his eyes in resignation
and then reluctantly starts to make his way out of the Hall. As he gets
to the doors he trips over Snorri, who wakes. The mouthpiece falls a few
feet away.</p>
<p><strong>snorri</strong>: Who’s that?</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: It’s me. I’m just going to water the
dragon…</p>
<p><strong>snorri</strong>: Oh… Snorri notices the silver mouthpiece on
the floor, but he pretends he hasn’t.</p>
<p><strong>snorri</strong>: Oh… clumsy idiot. Snorri pretends to go back
to sleep, but he opens one eye and watches Keitel Blacksmith recover the
mouthpiece, and then follows Keitel out. Loki gets up too. He follows to
keep an eye on Snorri. Cut to Aud on the shore, gazing moodily out to
sea. She is brooding in Erik’s imminent departure. Suddenly a stone
falls from above; she looks up and sees a figure appear on the cliff
above. Hurriedly she withdraws into the shadows. Keitel Blacksmith
appears on the cliff-top. In his hands he holds the mouthpiece of the
Horn Resounding. e examines it, turning over in his mind whether he is
doing the right thing or not. then he decides he must.</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: My fellow blacksmiths. He prepares to throw
it.</p>
<p><strong>snorri</strong>: Keitel! Keitel jumps out of his skin.</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>snorri</strong>: What are you doing, Keitel Blacksmith?</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: Get away, Snorri.</p>
<p><strong>snorri</strong>: What have you got there? Snorri advances
towards Keitel. Keitel backs away, dangerously near to the edge of the
cliff. His boot slips and he jerks himself forward. At the same time
Snorri makes a grab for the mouthpiece. A scuffle ensues, during which
the mouthpiece of the Horn Resounding is dropped. It bounces off the
cliff and falls down to the shore below. Aud steps out of the shadow and
picks it up. She frowns and looks up, and then screams, as she sees the
men fighting.</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: No! But it’s too late. Snorri goes white, gives
a hideous gasp… and sinks slowly to his knees - revealing Loki standing
behind him with a bloody knife. As Keitel and Loki watch Snorri die, a
drop of blood from the knife falls to the ground. The moment it lands,
there is a deep subterranean groan, and the earth begins to tremble
violently. Keitel and Loki look around in alarm.</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: Oh Gods! What have we done? Back in the
King’s Hall, Sven, Sven’s dad and Harald are wide awake, but for the
moment paralysed, as bits of masonry crash around them. The cheerful
figure of King Arnulf appears at the top of a stairway. He raises his
hands.</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: Stay calm! This is NOT happening. The
King then hurries out of a door at the top of the staircase.</p>
<p><strong>sven’s dad</strong>: What did he say?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Look out! The doors of the Great Hall burst
open and a wall of water crashes through, knocking the Vikings off their
feet. There is little doubt that the whole of Hy-Brasil is sinking see a
street go down, a statue sink and then we Cut to a close-up of King
Arnulf. He is standing at the top of the Forum steps addressing a crowd
of anxious citizens. They are keeping surprisingly good order
considering they are already standing ankle-deep in water, and the whole
town is rapidly sinking around them.</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: Now, I know what some of you must be
thinking… the day has come…. we’re all going down, etc. etc. But let’s
get away from the fantasy and look at the FACTS. FACT ONE - The threat
of total destruction has kept the peace for one thousand years. FACT TWO
- The chances of it failing now are therefore one in three hundred and
sixty-five thousand. FACT THREE… By this time the water is up to
people’s knees, and several have crowded onto the lower steps to avoid
getting wet.</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: FACT THREE - Our safety regulations are
the most rigorous in the world. We are all nice to each other, we never
rub each other up the wrong way or contradict each other, do we?</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: No. Rumble. The buildings sink and masonry
falls.</p>
<p><strong>citizen</strong>: We… er… do seem to be going down quite
fast, Your Majesty - not trying to contradict you, course.</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: No, of course you’re not, citizen. But
let’s stick to the facts. There has NEVER been a safer, more certain way
of keeping the peace. So whatever’s happening, you can rest assured,
Hy-Brasil is NOT sinking. Repeat, NOT sinking. We cut to an unfortunate
Hy-Brasilian who looks out of a window to see if it’s raining, but is
immersed before he can find out. The citizens in the Forum, however, are
reassured by the King’s words - even though they are now up to their
waists in water. One of them steps forward.</p>
<p><strong>another citizen</strong>: May I just make a point in support
of what King Arnulf’s just said?</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: We’d be delighted - wouldn’t we?</p>
<p><strong>citizens</strong>: Yes, we’d certainly like to hear what one
of us has got to say… Erik, Sven, Sven’s dad and Harald struggle out of
the Great Hall, carrying their belongings and the Horn Resounding, while
the citizen is still speaking most articulately in support of the King.
They are ALMOST in a panic.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: What are you all doing?</p>
<p><strong>citizen at the back</strong>: It’s all right. It’s not
happening.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: The place is sinking!</p>
<p><strong>citizen at the back</strong>: Yes… I thought it was too, but
the King’s just pointed out that it can’t be.</p>
<p><strong>citizen</strong>: …and, of course, we mustn’t forget King
Arnulf’s EXCELLENT eye for flower-arranging. There is a smattering of
applause. A few people pull their robes up out of the wet. Erik leaps
onto a wall and shouts to the crowd.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Save yourselves! Hy-Brasil… is sinking. There
are a lot of knowing smiles amongst the citizens.</p>
<p><strong>citizen from middle</strong>: Look, you don’t know our safety
regulations.</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: It can’t happen.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: But it IS! Look!</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: The important thing is not to
panic.</p>
<p><strong>citizens</strong>: Quite… yes… we understand….</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: I’ve already appointed the Chancellor
as Chairman of a committee to find out exactly what IS going on, and
meantime I suggest we have a sing-song!</p>
<p><strong>citizens</strong>: Good idea!</p>
<p><strong>another</strong>: Can we do the one that goes
“TUM-TI-TUM-TI-TUM-TI-TUM”? Erik looks around in despair. Meanwhile in
another street someone is struggling in the floodwater.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: I can’t swim! I can’t swim!</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: Relax!</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: I’m drowning! Help! Loki grabs Keitel round
the neck.</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: Let go! But Keitel is pulled under. He
re-emerges spluttering.</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: Urrgh! Argh! Let go, you idiot!</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Help!</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: You’ll drown us bo… But they go under again.
At this point Erik, Sven, Sven’s dad and Harald swim round the corner,
pushing the Horn Resounding. They see the figures disappearing under the
water.</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: Help!</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Help! Erik, Sven and Co. swim as fast as they
can to rescue the drowning pair. They struggle to overpower the
panic-stricken Loki, but he puts up a manic fight. Unexpectedly, Harald
Missionary suddenly unleashes a vicious right hook and lays Loki out
cold. There is a moment’s stunned silence that is no unmingled with
indignation.</p>
<p><strong>sven</strong>: You hit him!</p>
<p><strong>harald</strong>: Well, it’s what you’re supposed to do… isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>sven’s dad</strong>: Look! They look up as GOLDEN DRAGON
sails around a corner of the street, piloted by Aud. As the Vikings
scramble aboard, the sound of the “sing-song” reaches a particularly
noisy and discordant climax attract their attention. Back in what was
the Forum, a crowd of unconcerned-looking citizens is sitting on the
last roof and just coming to the end of another appalling song.</p>
<p><strong>citizens</strong>: …Te…Tum!</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: You know, I think we’re getting better.</p>
<p><strong>citizen 1</strong>: How can you tell?</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: Er…</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: Father! The King looks up.</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: It’s all right! It isn’t happening!</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: But, Father, it IS!</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Get on board!</p>
<p><strong>citizen 2</strong>: No THANKS!</p>
<p><strong>citizen 3</strong>: Who do you think YOU are?</p>
<p><strong>citizen 1</strong>: Panic-monger! The roof is now sinking
rapidly, though the citizens appear as unperturbed as ever.</p>
<p><strong>citizen</strong>: Leave us alone!</p>
<p><strong>sven</strong>: Yeah. Leave ’em alone.</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: It’s sinking! Hy-Brasil is sinking!</p>
<p><strong>king arnulf</strong>: Well, my dear, I think you’ll find it’s
all a question of what you want to believe in…. I have slightly more
experience of these matters than you… Unfortunately, at this point, the
entire gathering of citizens, the King and the Forum Temple disappear
below the waves.</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: Father! Harald Missionary has put his arm
around Aud in a fatherly way.</p>
<p><strong>harald missionary</strong>: There, my child… It’s at times
like this that this book can be a great help… Erik shoos him away.</p>
<p><strong>harald missionary</strong>: Right! GOLDEN DRAGON spins alone
in the wide ocean. Fade. Fade up some time later. They are all gathered
in front of the Horn Resounding.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: We must blow the first note… he note that will
take us to Asgaard…</p>
<p><strong>sven</strong>: Over the Edge of the World. The other men look
up at the Horn Resounding, and begin to feel a bit nervous.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: We are going where only the dead have been
before… Erik takes a deep breath and then puts his lips to the Horn
Resounding. He blows. There is a splutter, and one or two of the Vikings
titter amongst themselves. He has another go. But again, all he produces
is a pathetic spluttering.</p>
<p><strong>sven</strong>: Uh! Here! Give it to me! Sven pushes Erik
aside. Sven blow… he becomes redder and redder. But all he produces is a
splutter. He gets a bit angry.</p>
<p><strong>sven</strong>: Thor’s blood! Sven’s dad looks
heavenwards.</p>
<p><strong>sven’s dad</strong>: You’re not using the right technique.
Sven’s dad tries to take it over.</p>
<p><strong>sven</strong>: No! I’m doing it! They start to struggle.</p>
<p><strong>sven</strong>: You’re always telling me… TELLING me! Erik
tries to separate them.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Sven!</p>
<p><strong>sven</strong>: Let me do something for myself for a change!
Suddenly Aud comes forward.</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: No! Don’t quarrel! Sven and his dad stop
fighting, surprised by the vehement in her voice.</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: We’ll never get where we want to go if we
fight. Aud crosses to the Horn and inserts the mouthpiece. Loki glances
at Keitel. He hadn’t bargained for this!</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Er… don’t blow it! You never know WHAT might
happen…</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: It has not spoken for a thousand years… You
must bring it to life with a kiss… She puts her lips to the mouthpiece
and just touches it with them… almost a kiss… then… very gently… she
begins to blow… a soft… slight note can just be heard… Aud takes her
mouth away from the mouthpiece… and the soft note goes on…
reverberating… A sweet note… a magic note… the Vikings stand
stock-still, enchanted by the sound… and the sound all the time is
getting louder and the Horn begins to vibrate with the note. As the
volume increases the GOLDEN DRAGON itself begins to reverberate with the
sound. Rings of ripples begin to radiate out from the boat across the
calm water. The note grows louder and louder, and the Vikings, who at
first were laughing and cheering at Aud’s success, begin to get rather
alarmed. Louder and louder gets the note and the Horn shakes and the
boat vibrates. Things start to be shaken loose, and fall onto the deck.
Ropes uncoil and run loose. A heavy block suddenly crashes down to the
deck, crowning Harald and laying him out flat. Louder and louder grows
the note, and the Vikings have to stop their ears for the pain. The
water around the ship becomes more and more agitated. And then another
sound is heard. It is the thunder of water in the distance like a
million distant waterfalls. And suddenly they notice the sea is running
like a river - all in one direction… sweeping the ship forward with
incredible momentum. In no time they are engulfed in a mist, still
travelling at a rate of knots. Almost at once appointed rock looms out
of the mist ahead of them. Erik flings himself at the steering oar, and
everyone is thrown about as the ship veers wildly and just misses the
rock, only to see another looming up ahead of them. The ship veers
again, as a third rock looms ahead. This time Sven has grabbed a coil of
rope, and as they pass the third rock, he throws it like a lasso over
the rock. Loki and Keitel leap to grab the rope just as the rope goes
taut and the ship comes to a lurching stop, anchored by the rope, but
still swaying and buffeted in the racing waters. Those on board shout to
each other, soaked to the skin. It is difficult to make out what they
are shouting.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Help!</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: What d’you think? Help! Somebody help us!</p>
<p><strong>sven</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: She wants to kill us!</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: She wants to take us over the Edge of the
World!</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: You want to get to Asgaard, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: How do we know this is the way?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: We blew the Horn Resounding.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: SHE blew the Horn Resounding.</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: Don’t you see, Erik! She wants revenge!</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: She knows it was our fault!</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Keep your mouth shut, Keitel!</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: No! It’s YOU, Loki! I should never have
listened to you! Loki looks around desperately.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: You’ve lost your mind.</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: We came to stop you waking the Gods, Erik!
But I didn’t want anyone to get hurt!</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: You fool! Suddenly Loki produces his stiletto
and leaps onto Keitel, stabbing at him.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: I should have got rid of you long ago!</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: Like you got rid of Snorri! Erik tries to
separate them.</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: No! No! We are in the spell of the Horn! Hatred
will destroy us.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: That’s right! For a split second Erik is
distracted. He looks across at Aud and for a moment he sees Freya
standing there.</p>
<p><strong>freya</strong>: Once you are in the spell of the Horn, hatred
will destroy you… Then it is Aud once more. But in that split second
Loki has stabbed Erik.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Arrgh! Erik staggers back clutching his arm.
Keitel gives a roar of rage, and picks Loki up bodily and hurls him out
of the boat into the maelstrom. The other Vikings look on aghast. Keitel
turns on them</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: He killed Snorri! He caused the land of
Hy-Brasil to sink! SHE knew!</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: I didn’t know!</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: Now she wants to send us over the Edge of
the World!</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: How else d’you think we’re going to get to
Asgaard? The Vikings look at each other amidst the roaring waters and
the thick spray. Erik holds his bleeding arm and looks at Aud. Should he
trust her or not? Suddenly he turns on the others.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Do YOU know the way to Asgaard, Keitel
Blacksmith? Keitel shakes his head.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Do YOU know the way to Asgaard, Sven? Sven
shakes his head.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: There is one road before us, and that leads
over the Edge of the World. Harald sits up as he returns to
consciousness.</p>
<p><strong>harald</strong>: There IS no Edge of the World. Sven’s dad
bonks him again. Erik takes the rope and begins paying it out. With grim
faces the Vikings turn and face towards the roaring of the waters, as
Erik edge the ship further into the mist. The noise is deafening. It
would be almost impossible to hear any voice above it. The faces of the
Vikings betray their fear as they find themselves emerging from out of
the mist at the Edge of the World. They gape as they find themselves
confronted by a Waterfall of Seas - stretching on either side of them -
as far as the eye can see - water falling and plunging over the lip of
the world. And in front of them - the blue sky continues on down and
down until it shades into blackness strewn with stars beneath their
feet… Sven, Sven’s dad and Keitel edge to the prow and gasp.</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: No! Don’t look over the Edge! Erik lets out a
little more rope, until the ship is protruding over the edge. Sven, his
dad and Keitel peer over the side, and stare down into the abyss. They
gasp. From above we see the prow of GOLDEN DRAGON and the backs of the
Vikings’ heads in plain view against a backdrop of stars below them.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Let me see! Aud holds him back.</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: No. Don’t look… The abyss will suck away your
strength.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: I MUST look! Keitel! Hold this! Erik turns to
see Sven and Keitel trembling… They hold onto the sides of the ship but
their legs can barely support them.</p>
<p><strong>sven</strong>: There is nothing we can do…</p>
<p><strong>sven’s dad</strong>: Helpless… Keitel start to laugh.</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: Ha ha… I believed Loki… I believed I had a
duty to blacksmiths! Ha ha ha! Keitel laughs a little hysterically. Aud
turns urgently to Erik.</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: YOU still want to go to Asgaard?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: Do you believe I love you?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: I… but I…</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: You don’t have to love me. Just: do you believe
I love YOU?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Yes - I believe you do.</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: Then let go! Erik hesitates, then he decides to
believe in Aud. He throws the rope away. At once the ship shoots off
over the Edge of the World into space… Everything seems to slow down, as
the longship drops down and down… the ship twists slowly as it drops….
round and round. The Vikings gaze about them in wonder, as they find
their ship if falling in silence amongst the stars. Harald comes to once
again.</p>
<p><strong>harald</strong>: I’m still seeing stars. Keitel looks round
at him.</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: We’re ALL seeing stars.</p>
<p><strong>harald</strong>: No! I was hit on the head. The longship
falls and falls through the star-strewn space until it softly lands in a
white wilderness. On the deck the Vikings are huddles up, covered with
rime-frost. It seems as if they have been lying there half-frozen for
some time. Perhaps the entire adventure has all been a dream, and they
have been stuck in the Arctic pack-ice the whole time. The
hallucinations of men near to death. Aud tries to wake Erik.</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: Don’t sleep… wake… Look! Erik opens his eyes
and, for an instant, he sees Helga. He blinks and realizes it is Aud who
is calling him back to consciousness. Suddenly coloured lights begin to
play to his face.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Bi-Frost… The Rainbow Bridge. Above them the
Aurora Borealis stretches up, magnificent and awesome in the sky. Erik
makes his way through the other Vikings.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Wake up! The others slowly begin to rouse
themselves from their icy slumber and sit up, awed by the sight.</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: Are we dead?</p>
<p><strong>vikings</strong>: The Rainbow Bridge. They all peer up at the
ever-changing colours of the Aurora Borealis, hanging in the sky above
them like organ-pipes. But something is happening. The lights begin to
fade to reveal a magical city on a mountain. The Vikings realize that
this is journey’s end…. they have reached Asgaard… the City of the Gods.
The Vikings all catch their breaths and gaze in awe.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Asgaard!</p>
<p><strong>harald missionary</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>sven’s dad</strong>: Up there, you fathead.</p>
<p><strong>harald missionary</strong>: Up WHERE? Harald look round
quizzically at the others. It is clear that he can see nothing.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Look! It’s real. Harald looks around at the
others.</p>
<p><strong>harald</strong>: Hallucinations are real. It’s no use; Harald
can see nothing. The Vikings, transfixed by the sight of their fabled
home of the Gods, rise to their feet. Aud whispers to Erik.</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: The second note.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: The second not to wake the Gods… Erik kneels
in front of the Horn.</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: Gently… Erik blows… a soft gentle note… He
takes his mouth away, and smiles at Aud. Once again the Horn stars to
vibrate and the note gets louder… the ship starts to vibrate… louder and
louder… The whole landscape starts to vibrate… louder and louder grows
the not until even the stars in the sky are vibrating and then a magical
thing starts to happen… The note fades as one by one the shimmering
stars start to fall out of the night sky… they fall like silver snow…
until the ship… the Vikings… Asgaard… the whole landscape is covered in
sparkling dust… then in the ensuing silence the first light begins to
glow in the Halls of Asgaard… then another… and another… Erik stares as
is bewitched and slowly begins to climb out of GOLDEN DRAGON…. but Aud
tries to pull him back.</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: Erik! You’ve done what you came to do!</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Not quite… Aud looks at him.</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: Blow the third note! The note to take us
home!</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: There is something I must ask the Gods…</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: No living man has ever set foot in the Halls of
Asgaard… The Gods will never let you return. Erik looks at her… for a
moment… But he knows he has no choice.</p>
<p><strong>sven</strong>: I came to find my grandfather.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: I have to go…</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: Then I shall come too.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: No… no..</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: I don’T want to live WITHOUT you.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: But, Aud… I… I came to find someone… Aud is
about to say “Her?”, but she bites the word back and looks down at the
ground.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: I’m sorry, Aud… I really am. Aud kisses Erik,
who then turns and climbs out of GOLDEN DRAGON and sets off across the
ice. Sven follows.</p>
<p><strong>sven’s dad</strong>: Wait for me! I’ll be dead soon
anyway…</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: You can’t go without me! They follow. Even
Harald Missionary starts to follow.</p>
<p><strong>harald</strong>: Where are they all going?</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: Aren’t you afraid?</p>
<p><strong>harald</strong>: Oh… There’s nothing for ME to be afraid OF.
Harald smiles and sets off after the others. Aud follows. The stars have
fallen to form a shining, winding pathway up to the City of the Gods.
This is what the Vikings head for. Between them and the Citadel strange
huge forms rise up. The Vikings approach and find the vast skeletons of
the slain giants. The Vikings are but tiny gnat-sized figures wending
their way between the vast figures. They climb the stairway-path of
stars, up the winding road and eventually fins themselves outside the
massive doors of Asgaard.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Valhalla… Sven turns on Harald.</p>
<p><strong>sven</strong>: There! It’s real! It’s solid! Now do you
believe us? He pats the wall of Valhalla - the Great Hall. Harald
reaches out, but his hand goes right through the wall.</p>
<p><strong>harald</strong>: There isn’t anything. Harald Missionary
walks straight through the wall and disappears from sight. The Vikings
gasp, and run up to feel the point where he disappeared. The door is
perfectly solid to them, and they jump pout of their skins as Harald
suddenly reappears again.</p>
<p><strong>harald</strong>: You’re having me on, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: It’s Valhalla - where the warriors slain in
battle go.</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: It doesn’t exist for him.</p>
<p><strong>sven’s dad</strong>: He’s just s cynic. At this moment there
is a creak and the great doors mysteriously swing open. As if
mesmerized, the Vikings enter the Halls of Asgaard. The door slams
behind them. They spin round, but the doors have vanished… No man has
ever entered the Halls of Asgaard and left alive… Erik slowly starts to
cross the vast floor looking around him as he does so. One by one the
other Vikings follow. After a while Erik stops.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Listen! The Vikings listen. They hear the
sound of children laughing and shouting. Erik and his men follow through
the columns towards a pool of light. The scene that greets their eyes is
not at all what they had been prepared for. Valhalla is not full of the
warriors slain in battle, quaffing mead on the ale-bench and reliving
old battles - it is, instead full of children romping, laughing,
shouting, quarrelling and playing games… chess, fencing… dice… tag,
etc., around a wide hearth fire. Women are cooking and doing other
housewifely things… weaving, making bread, etc. It is a thoroughly
domestic scene. Suddenly one of them turns at Erik. It is Helga, whom
Erik accidentally killed in Scene One. She is once again kneading dough.
She has a red stain under her breast.</p>
<p><strong>helga</strong>: Oh good! It’s Mr Wonderful! Erik leaps to her
side.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: I’ve come to take you back to the land of the
living.</p>
<p><strong>helga</strong>: What a stupid idea.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>helga</strong>: What’s the point of being dead in the land of
the living?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: I’ll ask the Gods to give you life again!
Helga looks at Erik very sceptically. She obviously thinks he doesn’t
know what he’s talking about. Aud reacts. Erik takes Helga’s hand - and
gets covered in dough.</p>
<p><strong>helga</strong>: Have you tried to ask the God for
anything?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Well… no…</p>
<p><strong>harald missionary</strong>: Who is he talking to?</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: Sh!</p>
<p><strong>helga</strong>: Odin! One of the children, throwing pennies
against the wall, looks round.</p>
<p><strong>child odin</strong>: I’m busy. The Vikings are recovering
from their surprise.</p>
<p><strong>vikings</strong>: Odin?</p>
<p><strong>helga</strong>: He’s busy.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Is THAT Odin?</p>
<p><strong>helga</strong>: You’ll have to wait till he’s finished his
game.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Odin! Odin leaves his game and saunters
towards Erik.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: We have come from the world of Midgard… The
child whom Odin is playing with points his hammer at the ground near
Erik and a lightning bolt zaps into it. Erik jumps.</p>
<p><strong>child-thor</strong>: Clear off.</p>
<p><strong>odin</strong>: No, wait, Thor.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: You must help us.</p>
<p><strong>odin</strong>: We don’t HAVE to help anybody.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Fenrir the Wolf covers the sun - men fight and
kill each other the whole time.</p>
<p><strong>odin</strong>: Why should WE care?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Because… you’re… you’re the Gods….</p>
<p><strong>odin</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Bring the Age of Ragnarok to an end and stop
all this fighting and bloodshed. Harald looks around at the Vikings in
increasing desperation.</p>
<p><strong>harald</strong>: This is ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>vikings</strong>: Sh!</p>
<p><strong>harald</strong>: Right! The other Child-Gods have stopped
playing around now and are watching Erik and Odin.</p>
<p><strong>odin</strong>: Erik the Viking! The things you seek are not
in our power. We don’t make men love each other or hate each other.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: But you’re the Gods!</p>
<p><strong>odin</strong>: Look… Erik… Odin whistles. The other children
look over their shoulders. From out of the darkness of the perimeter of
the Hall, shadows emerge… shadows that, as they shuffle and stumble into
the light, reveal themselves to be the heroes that the Vikings had
expected to find in Valhalla. But they are not hale and hearty giants
quaffing mead and reliving their great battles… they are, in fact, a
sorry lot… the slain-in-battle still bearing the hideous deformities of
their fatal wounds. Most have a sword or an axe buried in some part of
their anatomy. One has been cleft in twain… The Vikings react to this
grisly gathering as more and more of them emerge from the shadows. They
gasp as they notice Snorri, Ivar, Thorfinn, Loki and Leif the Lucky.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Snorri! Ivar!</p>
<p><strong>harald</strong>: Here we are standing on a bare mountain top
talking to thin air. We notice that Harald’s cloak is being blown about
as if he were indeed on a bare mountain top. The other’s cloaks are
still. Sven’s dad is gazing across at one horribly mutilated
specimen.</p>
<p><strong>sven’s dad</strong>: Dad!</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: How can you tell?</p>
<p><strong>sven’s dad</strong>: I’ll never forget him! The BASTARD! Sven
reacts. Sven’s dad starts to go berserk.</p>
<p><strong>sven’s dad</strong>: He drove me mad!</p>
<p><strong>sven</strong>: Easy, Dad!</p>
<p><strong>sven’s dad</strong>: All his “you’ll never be a Berserk if
you lose your temper”…</p>
<p><strong>sven</strong>: Dad!</p>
<p><strong>sven’s dad</strong>: I hate you! I hate you! Sven’s dad
collapses against Sven and Sven comforts him, understandingly. A figure
emerges from the throng of dead. It is Thorfinn. Sven looks up at
him.</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn</strong>: You won, Sven.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: What right have YOU to try and stop men
fighting, Erik the Viking? There is glory in battle. There are riches to
be made and won…</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: Made by YOU, Loki!</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: By YOU - Keitel Blacksmith! Don’t you know,
Erik, that is why he went with you? Ragnarok was good for his
business…</p>
<p><strong>keitel</strong>: It’s not my business any more! Suddenly
there is a howl… a bitter howl that echoes above and around the Halls of
Asgaard and that gets more distant and more distant. Everyone freezes
and looks up, listening. Perhaps we cut away to the boiling sky as it
resolves itself into the shape of a wolf that snarls and slinks away.
Odin turns to Erik as the howling recedes.</p>
<p><strong>odin</strong>: Fenrir the Wolf has gone, Erik. But will men
cease fighting each other? THAT is not in our power… Odin starts to
laugh. All the other children start to laugh… so do the dead heroes.
Erik and his men look round uneasily.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: I have one more request before we return… Erik
turns towards Helga, who is still standing at her trough of dough with
her arms up to her elbows in flour. Aud watches Erik with sadness in her
heart.</p>
<p><strong>odin</strong>: Return? You have set your foot in the Halls of
Asgaard, Erik. You cannot return. Aud looks round to see how the others
react. It is as she had feared. Erik pales. The blood drains from the
other’s faces. Aud whispers something to Harald. Harald looks at her
blankly.</p>
<p><strong>harald</strong>: But you’re all imagining this… whatever it
is.</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: You’re the only one who can. PLEASE. Harald
look around at the dumbfounded Vikings. Then he shrugs and wanders off,
disappearing through the closed doors of Valhalla.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: You mean… we must stay here forever? As he
says this Erik’s eyes turn again towards Helga. He is clearly thinking
at least there are compensations… Odin, however, is laughing again.</p>
<p><strong>odin</strong>: Stay HERE? Ha ha! This is Valhalla. This is
reserved for those slain-in-battle.</p>
<p><strong>horribly slain warrior</strong>: Yeah! We’re the LUCKY
ones!</p>
<p><strong>a horribly slain friend of his</strong>: Yeah. It’s much
better than dying of old age. The ghastly and dismembered dead warriors
all chortle no end at the dismay written on the face of Erik and his
men. At the same time there is a grinding, winching sound. All those
around the hearth-place fall back as a vast grating is winched up from
out of the flames. The Vikings look at each other.</p>
<p><strong>odin</strong>: For YOU there is only the Pit of Hel! As Odin
says this there is a roaring sound and the flames and smoke are suddenly
reversed and as the roaring increases the flames are sucked down
altogether to reveal the black Pit of Hel itself. And now the Pit is
sucking the Vikings into it… their hair blows… they try to withstand the
force that is drawing them towards the abyss… The Gods look on in some
amusement. But some of the dead are concerned.</p>
<p><strong>sven’s grandfather</strong>: Son! My son!</p>
<p><strong>sven’s dad</strong>: Get lost!</p>
<p><strong>sven</strong>: Dad! Grandfather! Sven tries to reconcile his
father and grandfather, but it’s no use. He is sucked towards the
Pit.</p>
<p><strong>vikings</strong>: Help!</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: I tried to save you!</p>
<p><strong>helga</strong>: Why should you care?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: I don’t know! I just did! Erik can no longer
withstand the force that is sucking him down to the Pit of Hel.
Suddenly, however, Snorri has leapt from the ranks of the dead. He grabs
Erik and tries to stop him sliding towards the Pit of Hel. But it’s no
good.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: No! Let go, Snorri!</p>
<p><strong>snorri</strong>: I’ve got you!</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: You’ll be sucked down too!</p>
<p><strong>snorri</strong>: No! Arrgh! Meanwhile, Ivar and Thorfinn and
Leif the Lucky have also leapt forward to save their comrades. They put
up a fantastic struggle but remorselessly they are all sucked down.</p>
<p><strong>vikings</strong>: Aagh! The Vikings clutch at the stone
floor, their fingers trace blood as they try to cling on… but to no
avail. The first are already toppling into the Pit.</p>
<p><strong>vikings</strong>: Noooh!</p>
<p><strong>vikings</strong>: Ah! And the rest - including Aud - soon
follow. The mouth of the Pit of Hel, through which the Vikings are now
tumbling higgledy-piggledy, is a round white disc set in the unutterable
blackness of the pit. However, as the Vikings free-fall slowly towards
camera, they are lit up by a faint, reddish glow from below. They are
staring, wild-eyed and screaming as they fall. As they fall, Erik
manages to smash his axe into the side of the Pit. Thorfinn grabs his
leg and holds onto Sven’s foot. Leif clutches at Sven’s belt. Sven’s dad
hangs onto Sven’s foot. Ivar clutches Thorfinn’s foot. Erik clutches
Ivar’s leg and Aud clutches Erik’s. They dangle like this for some
seconds, and look fearfully beneath them. Then they can see the Infernal
Regions of flame and molten lava… somehow suggesting the face of a huge
and sinister creature. No wonder they’re scared out of their wits.
Meanwhile, Odin and Thor appear at the top of the Pit and look down with
mild amusement. Thor casually points his hammer and a streak of
lightning zaps Erik’s axe. It instantly glows red hot. Erik screams.
Suddenly we hear a new sound - a long, high, sweet note.</p>
<p><strong>aud</strong>: Listen! LISTEN! The third note! But it’s no
good. Erik has to let go of the red-hot axe. Everyone screams as they
start to plunge down towards the Pit of Hel. Cut to GOLDEN DRAGON.
Harald Missionary is blowing the Horn Resounding.</p>
<p><strong>harald missionary</strong>: I want to go home… Oooh! Suddenly
GOLDEN DRAGON, the Horn Resounding and Harald Missionary shoot up into
the air and disappear from sight. Cut back to the Pit of Hel. The
Vikings are looking down as they fall - they are still scared but
gradually start laughing… laughing as they fall down and down and down
until they fall out of sight. We are left with a blackness and just the
white disc of the mouth of the Pit of Hel above, until the disc changes
magically into the moon. There is a series of splashes. The note begins
to fade and the camera slowly pans down to reveal the Vikings all fallen
into the duck pond back at Ravensfjord. They are laughing and whooping
and splashing each other.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: I don’t believe it… Ha ha ha! It brought us
HOME!</p>
<p><strong>leif</strong>: But who BLEW it?</p>
<p><strong>ivar</strong>: Oh! Who cares? We’re HOME!</p>
<p><strong>thorfinn</strong>: Mum! Dad!</p>
<p><strong>sven</strong>: We’re back! Sven embraces his father and
dances him around with joy.</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: Yo hoo! We’re here! We’re… Suddenly the joy
drains from their faces and they each gape in horror. What is it they
see? We cut to see that out of the huts the women and children and old
men are emerging - but they are anything but happy. In fact they are all
bound and gagged. Behind them emerge the sinister figures of Halfdan the
Black, Gisli and maybe half a dozen armed men. Halfdan and his cronies
no longer look sleek and self-assured. They are haggard and desperate.
Their faces are streaked with dirt and sweat, and their clothes are torn
and soiled. They have clearly been going through a lean time, since
Ragnarok ended, and have descended on the village for revenge and for
whatever plunder they can find. They have a few sackfuls of booty with
them. They herd the women, children and old men into a pathetic huddle
in the middle of the village. Halfdan is spitting evil and hatred.</p>
<p><strong>halfdan</strong>: Throw down your weapons - or we shoot the
children first. Erik hesitates… The others look at him. What choice have
they? Reluctantly, Erik throws his weapons into the pond. The others
follow suit. Halfdan watches. His men stand around him in a tight group
with their backs to each other.</p>
<p><strong>halfdan</strong>: Good… Good… Right, now we’ll just shoot the
children anyway… Erik is paralysed. What can they do? Half Halfdan’s men
are aiming their crossbows at Erik and his comrades, and half are aiming
at the women and children. They raise the crossbows to shoot. Their
fingers tighten on the triggers. Suddenly there is a scream from
above.</p>
<p><strong>harald</strong>: Look out below! Everyone looks up and,
amazingly, out of the sky falls GOLDEN DRAGON and lands fair and square
on top of Halfdan and his gang, squashing them flat. Harald Missionary
staggers blearily from the wreckage.</p>
<p><strong>grimhild housewife</strong>: Harald! She rushes to Harald,
while the Vikings rush to release their loved ones. Great celebrations
all round.</p>
<p><strong>ivar</strong>: Look! They all turn and see the sun rising.
The villagers gasp in wonder. They’ve never seen the sun before. Erik
looks around and sees Thorfinn and Sven with their arms round each
other. Aud looks up as Erik smiles at he and holds her to him. Then they
all turn and gaze at the spectacle of the sun returning to the
world.</p>
