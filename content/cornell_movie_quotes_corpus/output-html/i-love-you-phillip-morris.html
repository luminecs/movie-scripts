<p><strong>title card-</strong>: “This really happened”</p>
<p><strong>title card-</strong>: “It really did”</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Where’s the crash cart!?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Love sure is a funny thing… It makes you
happy. Makes you sad. Makes you do all sorts of things you never thought
you’d do before. Love’s the reason I’m here actually.</p>
<p><strong>smash cut to:</strong>: “I Love You Phillip Morris” Green
Pages 5-23-08 2.</p>
<p><strong>red haired boy</strong>: I still don’t see it.</p>
<p><strong>little girl</strong>: It’s right there.</p>
<p><strong>young steven</strong>: It’s really big.</p>
<p><strong>steven’s mom</strong>: Steeeeeeeeeven…</p>
<p><strong>steven’s mom</strong>: Steeeeeeeeeven…</p>
<p><strong>steven’s mom</strong>: Are you a happy little boy Steven?</p>
<p><strong>steven’s mom</strong>: You’ve always been such a happy little
boy. Now Steven, we want to tell you something very important, but I
want you to understand that it doesn’t change a thing.</p>
<p><strong>steven’s mom</strong>: We’re still gonna love you, you’re
still gonna be our happy little boy and you’re still gonna–</p>
<p><strong>steven’s brother</strong>: You’re adopted.</p>
<p><strong>young steven</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>steven’s mom</strong>: It’s true.</p>
<p><strong>steven’s mom</strong>: Your brother overheard your Dad and I
talking and well, we didn’t want you to hear it from anybody but us.
It’s true. You’re a special little boy. You know why? Because we chose
you. Not like your brother here who’s natural.</p>
<p><strong>steven’s dad</strong>: Your Mother’s right. It’s cause we
love you. So we put some money in a brown paper bag and gave it to your
real mom in the hospital parking lot so you could come home with us.
Okay?</p>
<p><strong>steven’s mom</strong>: It doesn’t change a thing honey. We
love you just as much as we love your brother here… …and he’s
natural.</p>
<p><strong>steven’s dad</strong>: So son, are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>young steven</strong>: Yes Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: It hurt a bit, but I decided I wasn’t gonna
let it get me down. No way. I was gonna be the best son- No, the best
person I could be.</p>
<p><strong>mandi</strong>: Virginia Beach Police Department, how may I
direct your call?</p>
<p><strong>mandi</strong>: Something came for you.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Hey fellas.</p>
<p><strong>various policeman</strong>: Hey Steve, Steve, mornin’,
etc…</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Have lots of dreams…</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: …and if it wasn’t for you Jesus, I would
have never found that last coffee filter and Prayer-Girls would have
been ruined. So thank you for that.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Amen.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: And thank you for Steffie’s allergy screen
coming back all negative. I always knew it was in your plan for her to
enjoy nuts. And finally I want to thank you for this man Jesus. This man
who works so hard to make us happy without even a thought for
himself.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: This man who pursued me to the ends of the
Earth and promised me a life of eternal happiness. A promise he has kept
oh Lord. Every day. Amen.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Amen.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Sometimes when I think of how happy I am, I
just want to cry. Like the time when you–</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Okay let’s wrap it up…</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: And in your gracious name, I find thee and
praise thee. Amen.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Amen.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I’m absolutely bushed.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Me too.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Deb- You know how, as a cop, I have lots of
access? You know- records and things?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Steven-</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Now do you think it’s, you know, unethical,
to use that to find my mother?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Oh… that. Yeah, um, well I don’t know-</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I swear honey- getting around the system’s
so easy. No one would even know I did it.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: I know you want to find her Steven, but you
need to think about this.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: You’re right, I shouldn’t have done it.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: You did it!? Oh my God, Steven- what’d you
find?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I haven’t looked. It’s downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Really? Well let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Well hold on- let me finish.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Oh, right.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: There- that’s got it.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: She’s right here. She’s been right here all
this time.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: It’s really her?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Yeah. No question.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: My goodness Steven, that’s wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: What? What is it? Steven?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bascombe</strong>: Is something wrong officer?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Are you Barbra Bascombe?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bascombe</strong>: Yes. Is something wrong? Is someone
hurt?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: In a manner of speaking, yes. You gave up a
baby for adoption, correct?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bascombe</strong>: I don’t think I know what you’re
talking about.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Elizabeth City? St Jude’s Hospital?
Remember?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bascombe</strong>: I don’t know what you’re talking
about.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: You were young. I know that you made a
mistake giving me away, but-</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bascombe</strong>: Listen-</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Shhhhhh. Mommy please- let me finish.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: We all make mistakes. What I came here to
say is, I forgive you because none of us is perfect but now with a fresh
start we can build –</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bascombe</strong>: I have no idea what you’re talking
about, Steven.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: No, it’s okay, I know everything. But it’s
fine. Just tell me why–</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bascombe</strong>: Go away!</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Okay, okay. I understand. It’s a lot at
once. But I can come back. How’s that? I can come back later, I’ll bring
us some coffee and we can talk about…</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I quit the force that day. I packed up the
family and moved to Texas. I got a great job and got to living the
American Dream.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: I can’t find my blue fish.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Steven?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: In the laundry room.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Steven you haven’t met our new neighbors
down two and across the street- Neil and Sara.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: No I haven’t. I hope you’re planning on
changing the paint. What do you call that color?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Oh we’re changing it.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Good, good, good… good.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: So Debbie tells me you used to be in the
police force back in Georgia.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Virginia Beach.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Right. Sorry…</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Neil…</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Yeah, kinda lost interest. Got back into the
family business.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Which is?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Produce. I work for Sysco.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: That’s a big outfit. They give you that
Corvette out there?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Yes sir-ee.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Great benefits, too.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: And the hours don’t crush me either. I get
plenty of home time.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: It’s good to have him where I can keep an
eye on him.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Among other things…</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Ooooooh! Watch out!</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I’m gonna come, I’m gonna come…</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Oh did I forget to mention I was gay? Yeah,
sorry about that. I’m gay. Gay, gay, gay, gay, gay. Have been as long as
I can remember…</p>
<p><strong>little girl</strong>: I see a pony! What do you see!?</p>
<p><strong>little boy</strong>: I see a diesel train!</p>
<p><strong>red haired boy</strong>: I see a whirlybird!</p>
<p><strong>young steven</strong>: I see a wiener.</p>
<p><strong>red haired boy</strong>: What?! What kind of wiener?</p>
<p><strong>young steven</strong>: A man’s wiener.</p>
<p><strong>little boy</strong>: Shut up! There’s no wiener!</p>
<p><strong>young steven</strong>: Uh huh!</p>
<p><strong>red haired boy</strong>: No there’s not!</p>
<p><strong>little girl</strong>: Oh I see it. There it is!</p>
<p><strong>young steven</strong>: Told ya…</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Anyway where was I? Oh yeah–</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: And I did.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I had been living a lie for a long, long
time. I tend to do that… hide things.</p>
<p><strong>moustached man</strong>: You be careful out there, you’re a
little drunk.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Now just because I was screwing around
doesn’t mean I didn’t love Debbie. I did. I loved her with all my heart…
Stephanie too. My family was all I had and they needed me. So I told
myself it was just a little lie and it was better for everybody if it
stayed that way. That’s what I told myself. But life has a way of
forcing these things into the light.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: You might even call it an epiphany.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I haven’t lived my life.</p>
<p><strong>paramedic</strong>: Try not to talk sir.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Fuck you… No one is going to tell me what to
do anymore. No more lies. I’m going to live my life. My way. Be the real
me. Time for some good living. Buy what I want, do what I want, fuck who
I want. My way.</p>
<p><strong>paramedic</strong>: Okay sir whatever you say.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I’m gonna be a fag.</p>
<p><strong>paramedic</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: A big fag…</p>
<p><strong>paramedic</strong>: Alright. Let’s move.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Yep, just like that I decided to start my
life over and live it like the real me. No more lies. I was born
again.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: It would be hard to break it to Debbie, but
I knew I’d find a way…</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Honey, I’m gay!</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: To my surprise, we stayed friends. And I was
finally free.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Life was good. Everything was falling right
into place. I moved to Florida, got a new job, had two adorable pups, I
was dating a cute guy named Jimmy. I could do anything I wanted…</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: But it didn’t take me long to realize
something that never occurred to me before. Actually no one ever talks
about this but…</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: …being gay is really expensive. It is.</p>
<p><strong>boutiques, salons, resorts, gyms, haute cuisine</strong>:
RESTAURANTS, etc…</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I mean it’s not just sucking cock. It’s
wardrobe, it’s hair, personal trainers, big labels, resorts, fine
dining… it goes on and on and on. So I needed money. And for a guy
without a college education, my options were limited.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: So I had no choice– I became a con man!</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Of course that was easy for me, every closet
case is a con anyways.</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: Your check.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Now it didn’t happen all at once. It was
sort of a gradual thing…</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: It started with work. Tomatoes. I used to
buy low grade tomatoes in the field and sell them to clueless chain
stores as higher grade.</p>
<p><strong>produce manager</strong>: These are gorgeous. U.S-1
right?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Finest in the land…</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: It’s called `field buying’. I could clear
three thousand dollars in a good week doing that. But frankly it wasn’t
enough.</p>
<p><strong>saleswoman</strong>: Cash or charge?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Charge…</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Steven A Russell, Steven G Russell, Steven M
Russell, Doctor Steven M Russell, Doctor Steven J Russell… Ah!</p>
<p><strong>saleswoman</strong>: Thank you… …Mister Evans. Can I see some
ID?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: But when money got really tight, the slip
and fall always came in handy.</p>
<p><strong>kemple</strong>: Oh wow…</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: What do you think? Yes?</p>
<p><strong>kemple</strong>: Well Steven it’s beautiful. It really
is.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: You don’t like it.</p>
<p><strong>kemple</strong>: No, no, no. I do.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: You don’t like it.</p>
<p><strong>kemple</strong>: I’m menstruating. Don’t listen to me.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Tell me what’s wrong with it. Is it the
gold?</p>
<p><strong>kemple</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: That’s why I got you the stainless!</p>
<p><strong>kemple</strong>: Steven!</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: The gold one is for me, dipshit.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Merry Christmas!</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Merry Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Hi Debbie!</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: How’s Jimmy?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Good. Did you get the gifts?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Well that’s why I’m calling…</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: You’re welcome!</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: I can’t keep this.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Well… it’s not Christian.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Not Christian? Why’s that?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: This is not what the Lord wants.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: So you’re saying you know what the Lord
wants?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: No. I would never say that. Why? Do you
think this is what he wants?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: It’s the leap of faith Deb. It’s the not
knowing that’s the answer.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Well I never thought about it that way…</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Mommy look!</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Steven!</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Of course, Jimmy and Debbie had no idea what
I was up to. For the time being, at least…</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Morning Sandy!</p>
<p><strong>cherubic secretary</strong>: Morning Steven. You have
visitors.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Okey-dokey!</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Federal Marshalls…</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: They wanted me for all sorts of stuff-
Insurance fraud, identity theft, passport fraud. They were probably
gonna extradite me all the way back to Texas. I had to decide what to do
next.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: But one thing was for sure– I was not gonna
let them put me away. I was a cop and I knew what jail was like. And
there was no way I was going there. I had a plan.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Yep. Everything was gonna be just fine.</p>
<p><strong>kemple</strong>: Hey…</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>kemple</strong>: Why didn’t you tell me?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I can’t go to prison, Jimmy. I can’t. I
can’t go to prison. I can’t. I can’t…</p>
<p><strong>kemple</strong>: Okay-okay calm down. It’s okay. I just want
to tell them you’re awake and we can take it from there.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Did you know Steven was wanted?</p>
<p><strong>kemple</strong>: Not until just now.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: He likes to keep little secrets
sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>kemple</strong>: Like the fact that he was a big queer?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Yeah, like that.</p>
<p><strong>kemple</strong>: But suicide, my god.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Well he does tend to overreact.</p>
<p><strong>kemple</strong>: I feel like I don’t even know him.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Well Jimmy, that’s the thing. I’m not really
sure he knows who he is. He’s searching, at least that’s how I figure
it. I’m just not sure he knows what it is he’s looking for.</p>
<p><strong>kemple</strong>: Can you tell me exactly what he did?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: He has several warrants out in Texas. Fraud,
forgery, embezzlement…</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>kemple</strong>: I should have known… I should have said
something.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Don’t blame yourself Jimmy… I did the same
thing. There were always signs. I should have known he was gay when he
started shaving his chest.</p>
<p><strong>kemple</strong>: That would be a warning sign…</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: And all that Peter Allen music on his
Walkman.</p>
<p><strong>kemple</strong>: Denial is a powerful thing. I don’t feel so
bad now.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: I just never thought. But now stealing?</p>
<p><strong>kemple</strong>: He’s probably been doing it for years. I say
to myself he did it just to buy me things but I don’t think that’s
true.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: It’s bigger than that. I’m sure.</p>
<p><strong>kemple</strong>: But why then?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: And why suicide? I mean- just like that?</p>
<p><strong>kemple</strong>: I know- he seemed so happy and–</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Steven!!!</p>
<p><strong>kemple</strong>: Steven!!! Stop!</p>
<p><strong>kemple</strong>: Steven!</p>
<p><strong>kemple</strong>: Wait Steven. Don’t!</p>
<p><strong>kemple</strong>: Steven I’m serious! You stop or you’ll never
see me again! I mean it!</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Hi. Welcome to prison. I’m Steven.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Oh don’t worry, I’m not gonna hurt you.
First time?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Shit, I was so scared when I first got here.
But you get used to it.</p>
<p>****: “I Love You Phillip Morris” Green Pages 5-23-08 28.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Only took me a year. You just need to know a
few ins and outs and you’ll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: You’re gonna catch a beating any day now,
that’s just the way it is. I lost three teeth and cracked a vertebrae.
Anyway, all you need to do is fight back. Win or lose, just fight back.
Or you could try to suck the guys’ dick. Your choice.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Law Library. I pretty much live here. I
don’t really have anyone on the outside except my ex-wife- so I just
hunker down here learning everything there is to know about the law. Ask
me anything.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: See him. Over there? Him? Anything you want
from outside, he’s the guy. Candy, cigarettes, drugs, whatever. He’s the
guy. Just keep in mind- it’s gonna cost you a lot of money. Or you could
suck his dick. Your choice.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Three meals a day. Not so bad. Just make
sure if you make enemies with someone, he doesn’t work here. Otherwise
you’ll wake up one morning shitting blood and find out you’ve been
eating ground glass in your cornbread for six weeks.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Let me introduce you to the mail guy. His
name’s Gary.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: …letters, magazines, shit like that- it all
goes through unmolested. But if Grandma’s sending you cookies, or porn
or brownies or whatever– you’re gonna have to pay for it if you wanna
get it. Five bucks per item or you can suck my dick.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Your choice.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Well that’s about it. You’re gonna be fine.
Don’t worry. And if you need anything you just let me know. Alright?</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: So, uh, do I need to suck your dick?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: That’d be great.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Hi this is Debbie and Steffie. Sorry we
missed you. Leave a message. God Bless!</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Hey Debbie. Hi Sweetheart. Sorry I missed
you. I thought one o’clock was our time but maybe not. I sure miss you
guys. Thanks for the picture and the article. Sometimes it’s just nice
to know there’s someone out there who still cares about me since Jimmy
left and all. So… uh…</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Do you think I broke his heart? Sorry.
Sometimes I forget it’s just the machine… I’ll try you again next time.
One O’clock. Don’t forget.</p>

<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Thanks. Guess I need a few extra
inches.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Glad to help. How’s the bird?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Huh? Oh. Him, yeah… he’s at peace.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Oh, I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: It was for the best. He was suffering.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Civil law? You know, I’m an attorney.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: You suing someone?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: I don’t know what I’m doing. There’s a guy
I know- he’s in the infirmary now. He’s sick- he’s real sick… AIDS. I
thought maybe I could find a way to get him some help- I mean real help.
Not here. I don’t know- maybe I could– I don’t even know what I’m
looking for…</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Does he have a lawyer?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Have him get in touch with the Prisoner
Rights Committee. They deal with this all the time- pro bono. I’ve got
the number.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Well thank you, I–</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: My name’s Steven Russell.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Pleased to meet you Steven Russell, my
name’s Phillip Morris.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I haven’t seen you around Phillip. I’m
always in the yard…</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: I don’t go to the yard. You know what
happens to blonde haired, blue eyed queers in the yard…</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: It is kind of rough out there. You don’t
look like you belong here Phillip.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Why are you here?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: I rented a car… and kept it too long.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Grand theft?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Theft of service.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Insurance fraud.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: No. Just theft of service.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: No. Me. Insurance fraud.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Damn, we’re both in a mess aren’t we?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Don’t seem fair, does it?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: No, it don’t.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: You know, I keep finding that life’s a
little shittier than I thought it was gonna be.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Oh, listen to you, Gloomy Gus. I think
you’re gonna be just fine, Steven Russell.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I guess I’m inclined to believe you.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Why’s that?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I met you today, didn’t I?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: …I made the mistake of writing her and
saying I was lonely in here. And next thing you know, my ex-wife catches
her putting the neighbor’s puppy in a box to mail to me.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Ohhhhh, she sounds so sweet…</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Oh she’s an angel. I think I’ll be sure to
write her back and tell her I’m not lonely anymore… that I made a good
friend.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Why’d I have to meet you today?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Something wrong?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: It’s just- I’m being transferred to Michael
Unit today.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Don’t be sorry. It’s just across the
yard.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Well I don’t go into that yard so it might
as well be Oklahoma. Just figures with my luck. I was born Friday the
13th…</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: It’s not gonna change a thing, Phillip. In
fact, Friday the 13th’s my lucky day. Don’t worry, this right here. This
is destiny.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: But we only just met.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Listen, I’ve loved a lot. And I’ve been
around, so I recognize the feeling.</p>

<p><strong>steven</strong>: That one you and me are having right now-
the one you’re trying to forget exists because you’re going away. But
there’s about 6000 volts shooting across this table here and you know
you can’t deny it.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Don’t you think you’re coming on a little
strong?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I know you’re trying to protect yourself, I
get that. It’s fine. Give me a chance to prove you wrong.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: I’m sure I don’t know what you’re talking
about.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Good…</p>
<p><strong>cleavon</strong>: You Phillip?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Already?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Phillip, hope your new place is nice. Nice
enough anyway. I hope the chocolate made it to you okay. Check the
T.P.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I hope you try to make some new friends and
not be too shy. I guess I should tell you a little bit about myself…</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Dear Steven. I keep thinking about you
saying I’m shy. I guess you’re right, but I don’t feel shy around you. I
think that means something…</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Anyway thanks for the chocolate, but I
should tell you I’m diabetic so I probably shouldn’t… but I did anyway.
It’s been so long since anyone’s shown me any kindness and well, it
means a lot. I just wish you were here…</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: …Write me back soon. Phillip.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Hurry up would you?</p>
<p><strong>cleavon</strong>: I ain’t no motherfucking DHL, faggot.
Besides I ain’t got nothing for you anyway…</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: But it’s been three days.</p>
<p><strong>cleavon</strong>: You got a tracking number,
motherfucker?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>cleavon</strong>: Then shut your faggot ass.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Congratulations Phillip, scared off another
one.</p>
<p><strong>corrections officer</strong>: Morris - you got a new
roommate.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Oh my God. How the hell did you do
this?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I know a guy. I took care of it. I’m gonna
take care of everything…</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Enough romance, let’s fuck.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: And for a while I was Executive Assistant
to a Broadway Producer…</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Really? What’s a Broadway producer doing in
Atlanta?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: I didn’t ask.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: What’d you do for him?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: I mainly just rode around town in his limo,
drinking and sucking him off.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Now that I hear myself say it, I think he
was just some rich chicken hawk.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Oh well, he was a nice guy. I only dated
him for a little while anyway. Then I dated this full-blooded Apache who
made me dress up like a baseball player.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Apache? What was his name?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Melvin.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Phillip- you amaze me.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: What? He was a nice guy too.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: That’s what I’m saying- you only see the
good.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: What the hell was that?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: That’s the Screecher next door. He does it
all night. I never get any sleep. He drives me crazy.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: You poor thing. How awful…</p>
<p><strong>large prisoner</strong>: I’m gonna cut out your motherfucking
tongue with your screeching all night.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: What does he care- he ain’t in our
block…</p>
<p><strong>bald prisoner</strong>: Someone probably paid him.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Get up…</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Did you pay to have the Screecher beat
up?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Don’t bullshit me. Did you pay to have him
beat up?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Well you said he bothered you.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Just answer me.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Yeah. Yeah, I did.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Steven…</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: This is the most romantic thing anyone’s
ever done for me.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I just want you to be happy, baby.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: You are so amazing!!!</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Cleavon- put this in.</p>
<p><strong>cleavon</strong>: No man- not now.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: It’s important.</p>
<p><strong>cleavon</strong>: How important?</p>
<p><strong>cleavon</strong>: Ten.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Fine. But you gotta play the whole
thing.</p>
<p><strong>cleavon</strong>: Yeah, alright.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Promise?</p>
<p><strong>cleavon</strong>: Fuck you- my word’s my bond
motherfucker.</p>
<p><strong>cleavon</strong>: Fuck man- Johnny Mathis? Fucking white- ass
nigger…</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: C’mon…</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: C’mon. Dance.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: No. No… I can’t dance.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Yes you can.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: No I can’t. I’m serious…</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Honey, you’re queer- it comes with the
package.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Well not me.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: C’mon, I’ll show you…</p>

<p><strong>cleavon</strong>: Fuck you pig.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Turn it off or we’re coming in.</p>
<p><strong>cleavon</strong>: Well come on in. I got a dick that needs
sucking.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Rise and shine!</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Russell! Get up!</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Grab your shit! Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: What’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: You’re transferred. Nonney snitched you out
about the Screecher. You’re going to Ramsey Two.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Ah shit…</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Wait!</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Don’t you touch him!</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Steven-</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Don’t worry Phillip- I’ll-</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Shut up and move.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Steven!</p>
<p><strong>phillip’s pov</strong>: Steven is waiting in line with some
other prisoners to board a bus.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: I wanna go in the yard.</p>
<p><strong>yard guard</strong>: You do?</p>
<p><strong>yard guard</strong>: Hold your horses Dorothy.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: What the hell are you doing!?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: I love you!</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I love you too!</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: We’ll be together soon! I promise!</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Those were the longest three months of my
life. I wrote to Phillip every day until I got released.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: And once I did, I was determined to get us
back together as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Hi, how are you?</p>
<p><strong>taxi driver</strong>: I’m well. Where you headed? The
Greyhound?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Nearest thrift store please.</p>
<p><strong>taxi driver</strong>: Sure. You mind if I tell you the word
of our Lord, Jesus Christ?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Hi there, my name’s Steven Rousseau. I’m an
attorney. My client is Phillip Morris. I called earlier.</p>
<p><strong>duty officer</strong>: Mmm hmmm. There you are. Rousseau…
Phillip Morris. Like the cigarette huh?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I beg your pardon?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: You said you’d come right away, but
Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I got work to do honey, I’m getting you out
of here early. I got a hearing tomorrow morning, I got motions to file.
The law don’t sleep baby.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: I love you so much.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Phillip, you are the sweetest, most gentle
man I have ever met. And I know people have taken advantage of that. But
I don’t ever want you ever to lose that innocence. I want to build a
life with you Phillip. I want to protect you.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Get me out of here.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: The motion was filed, I presented to the DA
and got a letter from the judge- I do not understand what the hold up
is. I’m not some paralegal- I am Steven fucking Rousseau and I expect
proper adjudication!</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: My boyfriend’s getting out of prison next
week!</p>
<p><strong>housewife</strong>: How nice…</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: You want mayo with that?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I have an early release order for Phillip
Morris.</p>
<p><strong>release officer</strong>: Yep- Morris- we got him right here
waiting.</p>
<p><strong>release officer</strong>: And you are–?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I’m his lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: You’re incredible.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>baylor</strong>: Phillllip! It’s so good to see you…</p>
<p><strong>blake</strong>: Oh my God! You look great. Prison agreed with
you. How do I get on that diet?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Oh you couldn’t handle it- not unless we
smuggled an espresso machine in a cake.</p>
<p><strong>blake</strong>: Throw in a Sicilian Barista and I’m
there!</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: This is Steven. Steven- Blake and
Baylor.</p>
<p><strong>blake</strong>: This is him?! This is your gay lawyer prison
boyfriend?! Pleased to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>baylor</strong>: Much better than the guy who had you
kidnapped. What was his name?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Long story.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Can I get you all a drink?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: We gotta get a bigger place.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Steven I want you to meet my old neighbor-
Eudora Mixon. She is just the sweetest.</p>
<p><strong>eudora</strong>: Pleasure Steven.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Eudora…</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Eudora owns a little building in Montrose
and she’s having a hell of time with the builder. He sounds like a real
asshole.</p>
<p><strong>eudora</strong>: His plans were useless and he’s trying to
sue me to pay him! I need your expertise Steven. Phillip says maybe you
can help.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I could certainly try.</p>
<p><strong>eudora</strong>: Can you still practice law, having been to
prison?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Sure- why not?</p>
<p><strong>eudora</strong>: I just thought- Oh what do I know? I’d just
be glad to have someone I could trust. I’ll pay your normal fee.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: It would be my pleasure. Litigation is my
speciality.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Sorry I’m late but I’ve been hung up in
court all day. Let’s go in.</p>
<p><strong>steven’s pov</strong>: A beautifully ornate courthouse LIGHT
FIXTURE hangs from a courthouse ceiling.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Mister Russell?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: It’s a beautiful fixture.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: I know. It’s your turn.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Oh… Your Honor, Ms. Mixon engaged Mr. Gage
service in good faith and was given an inferior product. She is entitled
to deem that work to be unacceptable according to the contract that
Mr. Evans signed.</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: The terms of that contract were ambiguous at
best. The truth is, defendant engaged my client for three years without
full payment.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Your honor I have, in my briefcase, fourteen
other contracts, all on public record, in which Mr. Evans entered into
litigation with past clients of his!</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: Is this true?</p>
<p><strong>evans</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: You’re making me look like an idiot.</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: Your honor, I don’t have to tell you that
none of this is admissable or applicable to the case at hand.
Mr. Russell’s histrionics do not erase the fact that his client is in
breech of contract.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: He is right Mr. Russell- what do you have to
say?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I demand to be seen in chambers!!</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Okaaaaaaaay…</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Okay gentlemen, let’s get this over with, the
two for one at the Crab Boiler ends at five o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: This seems to be cut and dried here, sir. I
don’t even know why we’re back here. Mister Russell is treating this
like an episode of Matlock.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I’ll admit your honor- I’m a plain spoken
man. I didn’t go to Princeton. I didn’t go to Yale. My education was
modest. I went to a small school. I grew up on a small farm. But I
passed the same bar exam as my colleague here and I am not going to let
him push around this humble woman.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Point taken Mister Russell…</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: …but where are you going with this?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I think it’s obvious where I’m going with
this sir.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Are you talking about Marshall vs. Chao?</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: Shit…</p>

about.</p>

I did!?</p>
<p><strong>eudora</strong>: Yes. You did very well, Steven. Thank
you.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I mean, I did great! Really great! I’m so
proud of myself! You want half my sandwich?!</p>
<p><strong>eudora</strong>: Um…</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: No! We’re going out! I’m paying!!</p>

<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Can we afford this?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: You let me worry about the money
sweetheart.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Okay, well I guess I better start packing
boxes.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Not this weekend.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I think we both need a vacation. Key
West?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: I’ve been meaning to ask you something.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: That birthday cake you got me in the pen?
Where’d you get those candles?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Oh you know… just… people I knew.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Yeah, I know. But how?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Remember that guard? Skinny guy? Smoked a
lot?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Lance? He couldn’t been more than 98
pounds.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Yeah, that’s him.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Oh he was such an asshole.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Actually- I was in the yard once. Another
guard asked him to pay him back five. He opened his wallet and I saw
this picture of a little girl about Steffie’s age. So I brought it up to
him once, just to get him talking. That’s the thing about having kids,
you know? Gets people talking. Shared experience. Builds bridges.
Something I learned. Anyway he tells me he’s worried about her- mamma
was gone. We talked awhile. You know, I just listened. That’s all. I
brought up the candles just one time but mostly just listened… And the
next day, bedtime, there they were.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: How’d you know he’d do that?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I didn’t. I just knew I wanted `em for you…
and I found a way to do it. That’s all.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Just listenin’ huh?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: That’s it…</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: I’m gonna get a Coke… you want a Coke?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Uh huh…</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Aw, you don’t love me…</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: With Phillip I felt strong. I felt
invincible. I promised myself he would never want for anything ever
again. That meant I needed a real job. Something dependable. And- no
more scams.</p>
<p><strong>lindholm</strong>: Sorry to keep you waiting Steven.</p>
<p><strong>lindholm</strong>: I’m Dan Lindholm.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Were you a spaceman?</p>
<p><strong>lindholm</strong>: Yep. Never got out there though. NASA’s a
real political place. Never could figure out whose ass to kiss to get a
mission. All in the past. Barely even think about it now…</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: A spaceman, huh? How do you crap up
there?</p>
<p><strong>lindholm</strong>: Ass gasket. Have a seat.</p>
<p><strong>lindholm</strong>: With the popularity of HMO’s in today’s
health care system, doctors need help managing their billing– so they
can focus on their patients. That’s where USA Medical Management comes
in. Hundreds of millions of dollars pass through our system from the
HMO’s to the doctors. It’s a critical business. A powerful business… So
when I read your resume, I wasn’t sure what to think. Your level of
education and your past experience would factor heavily into this
decision and frankly…</p>
<p><strong>lindholm</strong>: …you were head and shoulders above the
rest. I mean, I could hardly believe it. But when I called your
references– well they couldn’t speak more highly of you.</p>

Russell, Mr. Lindholm . A real straight shooter. We were damn lucky to
have him at Prudential as long as we did.</p>

<p><strong>lindholm</strong>: Employee of the year two years running?
Developing software with IBM? You’re the kind of people we need here
Steven. We want you as our Chief Financial Officer. So what do you say?
I want your answer right now. C’mon Steven- let’s light this candle.</p>
<p><strong>rheba</strong>: …for example “he’s in a meeting” sounds
better than “he’s away from his desk” at least I think so, but whatever
you prefer.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: That’s fine… sure.</p>
<p><strong>rheba</strong>: I pulled all the claims for the last two
years as well as the statements, transfers and confirmations from the
bank. Most of it’s routine and I think you can get up to speed in a day
or two. Anything else I can do for you?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Uh…. cup of coffee?</p>
<p><strong>rheba</strong>: I’ll do it today but I don’t do that
really.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Crossover from traditional markets shows
declination and inverse diffusion seems commensurate with net-trade
trending. HMO penetration still leads PPO, NMO and FMO as usual but
attenuation is growing more prevalent in Q4 as projected… As for Q3,
well Q3 is what Q3 always is: Q2 with training wheels.</p>
<p><strong>birkheim</strong>: Okay Steven, your turn. I know you’ve only
had the one quarter to play catch up but I tell you, we can’t wait to
get some insight here.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Sure. What about?</p>
<p><strong>birkheim</strong>: Mark’s projections.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Mmm hm. Sure.</p>
<p><strong>birkheim</strong>: They seem kind of flat.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Oh. Okay. Ummm…</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Well I did a lot of work here and uh… I
think maybe… well I could just read it to you but uh… it might be better
to just uh…</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Well, I’ll just show you. Todd?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: If you look here at Mark’s projections again
for Q3, you’ll see- well you’ll see they’re just that- projections.
Projections based on a model set by my predecessor. I decided to reject
that model and do things a little differently. I want to show you my
results. This is what we actually made in Q3–</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Now let me tell you how I did it…</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: The tux? Where are you going?</p>

going?</p>

<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Gala? Oh… Sounds boring.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Yeah. I’ll be home early. Promise.</p>
<p><strong>lindholm</strong>: You see that?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: No… Oh- is it…?</p>
<p><strong>lindholm</strong>: Yeah. Probably deploying the arm right
now. Just a satellite deployment. Nothing special… Just touching the
face of God.</p>
<p><strong>lindholm</strong>: I want you to meet my wife.</p>
<p><strong>lindholm</strong>: Bev- Ladies- I want you to meet Steven
Russell, our CFO.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lindholm</strong>: Oh I heard about you.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Good things I hope.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lindholm</strong>: Yes and no. Don’s bellyaching about
how big your Christmas bonus is gonna be because you’re making him so
much money.</p>
<p><strong>facelift wife</strong>: Are you married Steven?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Uh… engaged.</p>
<p><strong>blonde wife</strong>: Well where is she, sweetheart?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: She works. Travels a lot. It’s killing her
she couldn’t be here.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: These are ready for Dan …</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Thanks Steven. You doin’ good?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Kind of. I just got back from my lawyer’s
office. I asked him, “What’s your fee?” He says, “I charge $50 for three
questions.” So I ask, “Don’t you think that’s a little expensive?” And
he says, “Yes it is… Now what’s your final question?”</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: It’s so true. Lawyers!</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Annie! Come here, you gotta hear this!</p>
<p><strong>birkheim</strong>: That’s the thing about the back nine at
Pebble Beach.</p>
<p>****: “I Love You Phillip Morris” Green Pages 5-23-08 67.</p>
<p><strong>birkheim</strong>: I don’t care what your handicap is… that
sand wedge is gonna get a workout-</p>
<p><strong>lindholm</strong>: I couldn’t agree with you more. I remember
one time, I was at Augusta…</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: The woman says,“That’s awful expensive,
isn’t it?” and the lawyer says, “Yes and now you only got one question
left!”</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: `Cause he already asked the two!</p>
<p><strong>lindholm</strong>: Mushroom and cheese. Anyway like I was
saying the Northrup guy says to the NASA “well that question’s gonna
cost fifty million to answer” so NASA says, “Don’t you think that’s a
lot of money?” and Northrup says “Yep, now you owe us another fifty
million. Next question please!”</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Yeah that’s a good one…</p>
<p><strong>lindholm</strong>: That’s why there’s so few shuttle
missions. They’re wasting all their money on bureaucracy. And probes…
Unmanned probes. Like people care if there’s life on Mars. No mushrooms,
I said.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Golf!?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: You’re a homosexual.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: It’s work.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: You know, you can tell them. They can’t
fire you for being gay.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I know…</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: I’m trying to be understanding here honey,
but golf? Why not just eat pussy?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Wish me luck.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Good luck!</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Oh! This is easy! Your turn Dan!</p>
<p><strong>lindholm</strong>: Hell of a hazard ain’t it Steven?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Oh yeah! How ya like that, sister!?</p>
<p><strong>client</strong>: So the black fella says to the jew lawyer-
“50 bucks a question? Ain’t that expensive?” “Yeah it’s expensive,” he
says, “I’m a Jew, you nigger!”</p>
<p><strong>client</strong>: Get it?!!</p>
<p><strong>client</strong>: There I am.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Maybe it was because it’s just my nature, or
maybe it was because of my past… or maybe it was because they were the
most boring fucking people I’d ever met in my life… Whatever the reason,
I had been robbing them blind for months.</p>
<p><strong>rheba</strong>: Anything else I can do for you?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Uh…. cup of coffee?</p>
<p><strong>rheba</strong>: I’ll do it today but I don’t do that
really.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: The thing about U-SAMM was that they took in
all this HMO money and distributed it to doctors.</p>
<p>****: “I Love You Phillip Morris” Green Pages 5-23-08 71.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: But in the time between receiving the money
and paying it out- it was just sitting there, not making interest or
anything.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: It occurred to me to set up an investment
account where the held money would earn interest for the short time that
the company had it. We’re talking twenty two million at any given time
here, so even short term the interest adds up pretty quickly. I’d be
making the company millions virtually overnight.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: …and I of course would take a commission.
Say… fifty percent. The only problem with that was– I wasn’t the one
signing the checks.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: So I ask, “Don’t you think that’s a little
expensive?” and the lawyer says, “Yes it is, now what’s your final
question?”</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: It’s so true. Lawyers!</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Annie! Come here, you gotta hear this!</p>
<p><strong>lindholm</strong>: Steven, we got a problem. Vera lost that
stupid rubber stamp again. Her office is a goddamned disaster and she’s
the o-ring if you know what I’m saying.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Oh… how long till we can get a new one?</p>
<p><strong>lindholm</strong>: Nope. Time to overhaul the program. I got
a computerized system already on order. No more room for pilot
error.</p>
<p><strong>lindholm</strong>: Should be up and running in a couple
months. I want you signing the checks until then.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Really?! Great!</p>
<p><strong>lindholm</strong>: You play golf?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Uhhh… yeah. Sure.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: How big was this Christmas bonus?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Pretty big.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: In July?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: The sheriff is desperate and goes to a
psychic. All the woman says is rabbit. Rabbit-rabbit-rabbit, that’s all.
Well he thinks `bullshit’ and he’s driving back home and what happens?
He sees a rabbit crossing the street in front of him. So he pulls over
and follows it into the woods and he finds the missing car. All wrecked
and turned over and the girl’s inside… still alive.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: I swear. It’s in the Ricky Martin People in
the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Yeah… they can find out all sorts of stuff,
those people.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Mmm hmm…</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: They can find out anything about anyone…
anything. They could even find out something about you…</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Phillip… what is it?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: It’s just– Is something going on? Something
you’re not telling me?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Because if there is, stop now.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: There isn’t. There’s nothing.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: I don’t care about the money, the house,
jet-skis- all I want is you. I just want us to be together.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: We’re always going to be together. And there
is nothing going on. I promise. I wouldn’t lie to you, baby.</p>
<p><strong>birkheim</strong>: Nice car.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Thanks, Larry.</p>
<p><strong>birkheim</strong>: Which one is it?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: SL. That the C you’re driving?</p>
<p><strong>birkheim</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Good car.</p>
<p><strong>birkheim</strong>: Mmm hm.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Good value.</p>
<p><strong>birkheim</strong>: I have some questions about these new
accounts we’ve opened.</p>
<p><strong>birkheim</strong>: Yeah… I was wondering if we could compare
some numbers. I know you usually talk to our CFO but this is a delicate
matter and I’d like keep it secret for now.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Hi Mister Ru–</p>
<p><strong>automated teller</strong>: Hello, you’ve reached the
Automatic Teller at Texas Commerce Bank. Please enter your personal
account number followed by the pound sign.</p>
<p><strong>automated teller</strong>: Thank you. Your account balance is
eight hundred-thirty seven thousand five hundred and two dollars and
twelve cents. To repeat this-</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Hey Debbie.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Steven. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Good. How’s Steffie doing?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Good. Real good. She sure is your
daughter…</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: She’s interested in boys already?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Ha-ha. How’s Phillip?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: He’s good. He says hi, but listen- I just
wanted to call and let you know I’m switching all my phone numbers. I’ll
let you know when we get a new one.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Oh Steven, are you on the lam again?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Deb, you always knew me best.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Steven you really should stop all this, you
are such a good man and I know that Jesus has a plan for you.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Well, maybe this is his plan.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Now don’t start.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Anyway Debbie- that’s my boss calling. I
love you both and I’ll call you soon.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>lindholm</strong>: Steven? Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: The Gulf Freeway. Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>lindholm</strong>: At the office. You coming back anytime
soon?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Is something wrong?</p>
<p><strong>lindholm</strong>: No, we just want to see you Steven. We
miss you is what it is.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Oh, that’s nice Dan. But I don’t think I’m
coming back in. I think we both know why.</p>
<p><strong>lindholm</strong>: You sure about that Steven?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Bye-bye Dan.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: People keep calling, what’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Nothing. Thought we’d take a little
vacation. Key West. Let’s pack. Quick! Okay I’ll pack for you!</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: I fucking knew it- you did do something.
You lied to me! You looked me right in the eye and lied!</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Now don’t get angry, it’s gonna be fun, I
swear.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Are you going back to jail? Steven, you
promised we’d always be together!</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Of course we are! We’re never gonna be
apart. Never.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: You lying son of a bitch! You took
advantage of me! Just like all the rest!</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: We’ll get a place. Do some fishing. I can
work on my key lime pie recipe…</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: …I might even grow a beard and enter the
Papa Hemingway contest!</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Phillip? Honey?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: There I was, keeping secrets, living a lie.
Like I said, I tend to do that. Now I didn’t blame Phillip for running
out on me, but I had to make things right. I had to get him back. You
see, there’s something I didn’t tell you… …it’s about my old boyfriend.
Do you remember him? His name was Jimmy.</p>

<p><strong>houston cop</strong>: Diabetes huh?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I wasn’t going to lose Phillip. No way. I
broke Jimmy’s heart and I was not gonna break Phillip’s. I was gonna
make everything alright. No matter what it took, I was going to
escape.</p>
<p><strong>driving cop</strong>: Fuck… what is that?</p>

<p><strong>attorney</strong>: Your honor…</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Nine hundred thousand!? It’s a white collar
charge.</p>
<p><strong>attorney</strong>: Your honor-</p>
<p><strong>houston judge</strong>: Mister Russell is a flight risk. The
bond is set. Nine hundred thousand.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: This is bullshit. Set a reduction
hearing.</p>
<p><strong>attorney</strong>: Your honor we’d like to set a reduction
hearing.</p>
<p><strong>houston judge</strong>: That’s your right, but I strongly
advise you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>houston judge</strong>: Fine. You can have your hearing
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Next week.</p>
<p><strong>attorney</strong>: We’d like next week if that’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: On the thirteenth.</p>
<p><strong>attorney</strong>: Oh the thirteenth if possible.</p>
<p><strong>houston judge</strong>: Fine. Friday the thirteenth. Now go
away.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Dearest Tyler. Long time no talk. I won’t
beat around the bush. I got into a spot of trouble here in Houston and
find myself needing help. That’s right, jail again. Anyway I was
wondering if you could type up this thing for me on your computer just
like I sketched out…</p>

<p><strong>steven</strong>: This the clerk’s office?</p>

<p><strong>steven</strong>: Charles Hearn- I got a bail adjustment
coming through, sent it over today.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Sure thing. What’s the name?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Russell. Steven Jay.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Got it right here.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Good, I need that to go through right away.
Because if it don’t, I’m gonna have to chug about a quart of Tidee Bowl
on account of all the shit I’ll be eating. Know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: You got it Judge.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: And say- Julie? Can you save me a dime and
connect me to a good bail bondsman?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Sure thing.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Go away Steven!</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: You think I didn’t know you were
coming!?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Phillip-</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Get the hell out of here! I’m done with
you!</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Don’t say that.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: They probably have a psychic after you
right now! Did you see any bunnies!?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Honey, I know you’re upset- but we love each
other.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: You opened a bank account for Doctor
Phillip Morris! Now they think I’m in on everything! I’m facing real
time! You know I can’t go back to prison.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I’m sorry about that- they weren’t supposed
to find that. It was for your own good. So we could be together.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Fuck off! I’m in enough trouble.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: C’mon Phillip, just trust me-</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: FUCK YOU YOU FUCKING LIAR! Do you realize
how bad you’ve fucked me over!! You made me an accomplice! You fucking
liar! I don’t want to see you. Go away! I never want to see you
again!</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Phillip don’t say that.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Well what am I supposed to do?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: You’re the lawyer, you figure it out.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Oh my God…</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: You’re not even a lawyer?! You fucking
liar!</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: What the hell’s going on?! Who the hell are
you!?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Open the door Phillip.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Open the door. Just open the door. Open the
door. Please. I just want to say one thing. Please. Just one thing.
That’s all. Please.</p>
<p><strong>swat commander</strong>: Down on the ground faggots!!</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Phillip?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Don’t.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: From the moment we met, you’ve done nothing
but lie. Our whole relationship… just lies. I’m such an asshole. You
took advantage of me- just like all the rest of them. You were supposed
to protect me- but you’ve done nothing but make a fool of me. And you
expect me to love you? How can I love you? I don’t even know who you
are. And you know what’s sad? I don’t even think you know who you are.
So how am I supposed to love something that don’t even exist? You tell
me.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Morris. You’re up.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: I will never forgive you Steven. Never.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: That was the last time I ever saw him.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: …But I knew he was right. Phillip, Jimmy,
Debbie- they’ve all been right. My whole life was nothing but a bunch of
lies. Lies to make people love me, lies to keep them from leaving me and
lies to make them give me their money.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: And in the process I lost track of who I
was. Maybe Barbra Bascombe had me pegged right from the beginning and
that’s why she gave me up…</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Whatever the case, how does a person who
doesn’t exist go on existing? Well the answer is- he doesn’t.</p>
<p><strong>bunkmate</strong>: Shut the fuck up, I’m trying to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>male nurse</strong>: I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>young doctor</strong>: I’m sorry to have to tell you this
Steven, your t-cell counts indicate that, uh… Well… you have AIDS.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: How long do I have?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Where’s the crash cart!?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: So here we are, where you first met me…</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I’ve been in this bed for months now.
Waiting to die. The only thing that keeps me going is the thought that I
might get a chance to see Phillip one more time. But I don’t know how
much longer I can do this…</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: Got a minute?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Samuel. You want some crackers?</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: No… thanks. Look- I just talked to my
friend- he’s a nurse at the infirmary. I don’t know if you know this or
not but uh…</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: LET ME IN! Just let me in!</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: He’s not here!</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: I need to see him!</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: I told you he’s not here! You need to calm
down.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Just tell me where he is. What
happened?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: He slipped into a coma for a few days. He’s
conscious now, but he’s very sick. We had him transferred to a private
care facility. There was nothing we could do for him here. It’s just a
matter of time now.</p>
<p><strong>caretaker</strong>: Steven?</p>
<p><strong>caretaker</strong>: Steven? Someone wants to talk to you. He
keeps calling. He’s driving us crazy.</p>
<p><strong>caretaker</strong>: Okay you can put him through.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I didn’t want you to find out…</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Steven. Oh God… Why didn’t you write me? I
don’t know how this happened, they say I’m fine. Oh God, who did this?
It doesn’t matter. I had to talk to you Steven. I am still angry with
you, but I need you to know something. Even if sometimes I don’t know
who you are, I love you. I never stopped loving you. You and me are just
fools for love I guess- written in the stars or some crap like that. But
it was never better, never more real than with you Steven. I realize now
that all that crazy shit you did- in your fucked up way- it was always
for me. Always for us. You are the most amazing man Steven. It takes my
breath away. And even though I can’t be with you now, I will always be
yours… Forever.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Now if you have to go, go. It’s okay. I’m
right there. Okay? I’m right there.</p>

<p><strong>steven</strong>: When you’re right you’re right Cleavon…</p>
<p><strong>cleavon</strong>: Wanna suck me off?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: No thanks.</p>
<p><strong>cleavon</strong>: Well sweet dreams then.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Lying there in all my misery, I had a moment
of clarity. It became clear to me- I had to get to Phillip. No matter
what. Even if it meant dying…</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Faking your death from AIDS is no easy task,
believe me. But after watching Jimmy die, I thought I could make it
convincing. First, you have to starve yourself- I ate half as much every
day for ten months. After that, you have to fake all sorts of
symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: You gotta keep this up for months until you
lose about, say, 80 pounds.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: But the hardest part is falsifying your
records.</p>

<p><strong>steven</strong>: Hey Lawrence- you still work in the
infirmary?</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Mmm hmm…</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: You like coffee?</p>
<p><strong>male nurse</strong>: I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>young doctor</strong>: …you have AIDS.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: How long do I have?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Where’s the crash cart!?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: But the hardest part by far is getting
transferred to a private care facility. It’s standard procedure for late
stage patients, but convincing them I was about to die would involve
taking a few risks.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: After a four day coma, they were
convinced.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: This is Doctor Rios from the Hamblin Center,
Houston. I’m looking for AIDS patients for a study we’re…</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: And once I got settled in, I just called the
Department of Corrections and convinced them I was a state-sponsored
doctor looking for late stage AIDS patients for an experimental
treatment. As luck would have it, they had one patient that was
eligible…</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Oh you do? Steven Russell? Could you spell
that?</p>
<p><strong>orderly</strong>: Mister Russell, the clinic sent a taxi here
to pick you up.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: And for all that time- all those doctors,
all those nurses and all those facilities… not one of them ever thought
to give me an AIDS test…</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Fucking Texas…</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I had a special request when I ordered the
cab. Did they tell you?</p>
<p><strong>taxi driver</strong>: Yeah- right here.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Thank God.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: A week later, the hospice was to get a call
from Doctor Rios, telling them Steven Russell had died undergoing
treatment. And after all that hard work dying? Where’s the first place I
go?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Funny, huh?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: You’re such a fucker!</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I know- I’m sorry- You weren’t supposed to
find out.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Well I did!</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I couldn’t take a chance telling you. You
know that. I couldn’t. But Phillip, I only did it so I could get here to
you. Just to talk to you. And here I am.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: You’re so skinny.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I’m fine. Just hungry.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Steven I don’t-</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Wait. Listen. I just came here to tell you
one thing and that’s it. You don’t have to take me back, I just want to
say one thing.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I know you thought we were nothing but a
lie- but underneath all those lies there was always something that was
real. I thought about what you said to me. You said you don’t know who I
am. But I have to tell you- I know now. I know who I am. I mean- I’m not
a lawyer, I’m not a CFO, I’m not a cop. Hell I’m not even an escape
artist. Those Steven Russells are dead. And now, all that’s left is the
man that loves you. That’s all. Nothing else. I’m just the man that
loves you. And if you can see that… believe it… then I promise I’ll
never be anything else ever again.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: How do I know you’re not bullshitting me
again?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: You don’t.</p>
