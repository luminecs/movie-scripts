<p><strong>super:</strong>: Tuesday, April 28th 1992</p>
<p><strong>wide-shot</strong>: A vast, snow-blanketed wilderness that
sits beneath the icy summits of the highest mountain range in North
America. This is BIG Alaska.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Come here.</p>
<p><strong>cut in to</strong>: TIGHT SHOT over the back-packed shoulder
onto the DRIVER.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: You left your watch, your comb, your
change…</p>
<p><strong>backpack</strong>: Keep it.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: I don’t want your money. And I already have
a watch.</p>
<p><strong>backpack</strong>: If you don’t take it, I’m gonna throw it
away. I don’t want to know what time it is, what day it is, or where I
am.</p>
<p><strong>backpack</strong>: I don’t want to see anybody. None of that
matters.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Take em.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: If you make it out alive, give me a call,
and I’ll tell you how to get the boots back to me.</p>
<p><strong>backpack</strong>: Hey, do me a favor, will ya? Take a
picture of me.</p>
<p><strong>cu</strong>: driver</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: You gonna be alright?</p>
<p><strong>backpack</strong>: I’ll be better than that.</p>
<p><strong>super:</strong>: May 1990</p>
<p><strong>intercut</strong>: CHRIS MCCANDLESS. We don’t see his face,
just feet pounding the pavement at an increasing pace.</p>
<p><strong>intercut</strong>: Chris, on his run, sweatshirt hood over
head. Amongst assembled crowd and family we find: THE</p>
<p><strong>mccandless’</strong>: BILLIE, mid to late forties with dark
striking eyes; WALT, a taciturn man, early fifties; and CARINE,
eighteen, pretty with her mother’s eyes and waist length brown hair, a
gold crucifix dangles from her neck. They look around, looking for
Chris, he’s nowhere in sight.</p>
<p><strong>intercut</strong>: Chris, in a shower He TURNS INTO CAMERA,
the water streaming down his face.</p>
<p><strong>slo-mo</strong>: A ballet of graduation caps float upward
into a frame of blue sky. We HEAR Chris’ voice OVER this image as we
intermittently cut away from the caps against the sky to focus on his
parents.</p>
<p>****: floating caps in FOREGROUND, Walt and Billie An outer glee in
sharp contrast to voice over:</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I see them standing at the formal gates of
their colleges, I see my father strolling out under the ochre sandstone
arch, the red tiles glinting like bent plates of blood behind his head,
I see my mother with a few light books at her hip standing at the pillar
made of tiny bricks with the wrought-iron gate still open behind her,
its sword-tips black in the May air, they are about to graduate, they
are about to get married, they are kids, they are dumb, all they know is
they are innocent, they would never hurt anybody. I want to go up to
them and say Stop, don’t do it–she’s the wrong woman, he’s the wrong
man, you are going to do things you cannot imagine you would ever do,
you are going to do bad things to children, you are going to suffer in
ways you never heard of, you are going to want to die. I want to go up
to them there in the late May sunlight and say it, her hungry pretty
blank face turning to me,</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: her pitiful beautiful untouched body, his
arrogant handsome blind face turning to me, his pitiful beautiful
untouched body, but I don’t do it. I want to live. I take them up like
the male and female paper dolls and bang them together at the hips like
chips of flint as if to strike sparks from them, I say…</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: Here they are.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I say…Do what you are going to do, and I will
tell about it.</p>
<p><strong>carine</strong>: Who wrote that?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Well, it could’ve been either one of us,
couldn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: There’s a lot of great poems in there.</p>
<p><strong>carine</strong>: Thanks, big brother.</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: You scared the daylights out of me, jumping
on to that stage, oh my god.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Congratulations, son.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I’m starving.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: My grades are gonna be good enough, I think,
to get into Harvard Law.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: That’s a big deal. What do you have left in
your college fund?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: It’s an inheritance, dad. I’ve only been
spending it as a college fund…Exactly twenty-four thousand five hundred
dollars and sixty-eight cents.</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: That’s very specific.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I had to go to the bank this morning.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Well, we’ll certainly contribute the balance
for Harvard.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Yeah. I’ve got to figure out what I’m going
to do. I got a lot of things to pack and organize here first.</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: I’m so glad you’re getting out of that place
you’re living. It was so much nicer when you lived on campus.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: You’ll come to Annandale before you disappear
on us, won’t you?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Sure, I will.</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: You promise?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Mom.</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: Well, your father and I want to make a
present to you.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: We want to get you out of that junker.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: What’s a junker?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: The Datsun?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Yes. We want to get you a new car.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: A new car? Why the hell would I want a new
car? The Datsun runs great.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Do you think I want some fancy boat? Or are
you worried about what the neighbors might think?</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: We weren’t going to get you a Cadillac,
Chris. Just a nice new car that’s safe to drive. You don’t know when
that thing’s just going to suddenly blow up.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Blow up? Blow up?! Are you guys crazy? It’s a
great car. I don’t need a new car. I don’t want a new car. I don’t want
anything. Thing, thing, thing.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: But, thanks anyway.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Everything’s gotta be difficult.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I said thank you. I just don’t want
anything.</p>
<p><strong>carine</strong>: I wouldn’t say no to a new car.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Ivana Trump McCandless.</p>
<p><strong>carine</strong>: Shut up, Chris. Seriously, I’ll pay you
back.</p>
<p><strong>montage</strong>: We travel with Chris and his Datsun through
the towns and open highways, landscapes and landmarks, days and nights,
that lead to the Mojave desert in the West.</p>
<p><strong>pov</strong>: As far as the eye can see in the desert
moonlight, water has taken over the desert with a flash flood.</p>
<p><strong>wide-shot</strong>: We see the abandoned Datsun nearly a mile
behind Chris as he walks toward us wearing his backpack. He comes very
close to camera and as we PAN him 180, we see as much wilderness before
us as we did behind.</p>
<p>****: Chris walks into the distance.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: This is Emory University freshman Chris
McCandless reporting from the vault at Thompson Hall.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: We have just dynamited the hatchway and are
the first human beings to step foot into this vault in over a hundred
years. Somewhere in here lies the secret of the great beast within us
all. A beast built on lies, corruption, and greed.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: And there it is! The legendary beast
Mocra.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: We’ve got to get out of here quick and re-
secure the hatch while we make a plan of how to kill the beast.</p>
<p><strong>clumsy video time cut</strong>: Chris nailing the last nail
in the hatchway from below. He climbs down the steps where he exchanges
his hammer for his microphone from an off- camera source.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Well, it looks like we’ve succeeded -</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: - at least for the moment, in sealing the
beast back into the vault. Your humble reporter, Chris McCandless will
now struggle with the journalistic question of ethics: Will he retain
his reporter’s objectiveness or save the future of human truth by
slaying this awful beast?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Once again, your humble reporter Chris
McCandless.</p>
<p><strong>os student</strong>: What is this? Filmmaking 101?</p>
<p><strong>os student #2</strong>: Point the camera at me. I’m a
star.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Pay no attention to the voices behind the
curtain.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Ted! We’ve got a monster in the vault. It
represents all the corruption, the deceit, and greed within us all. I
must slay it.</p>
<p><strong>ted turner/student</strong>: McCandless, how many times have
I had to tell you? I’ve had to tell you that you are a journalist and
you can’t get personally involved in your cases…or your stories.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Ted! I know how to kill it. And I’m the only
one who knows. You can’t keep sending me on stories and expecting me to
do nothing! I look like some kind of an idiot.</p>
<p><strong>ted turner/student</strong>: Do you know who you’re talking
to? I’m Ted Turner.</p>
<p><strong>panicked student</strong>: McCandless! You’ve got to hurry!
The monster is scratching at the hatchway. He’ll be out in no time.</p>
<p><strong>ted turner/student</strong>: It’ll mean your job, Chris
McCandless.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: That’s it, Ted. Fire me if you want but this
beast must be slayed.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: This is the only thing that can kill the
monster. It’s gonna be risky but without great risk, there is no
freedom. So we will now hear from the famous singer - Chris
McCandless.</p>
<p><strong>carine</strong>: When we were little, Chris was very to
himself. He wasn’t anti-social, he always had friends, and everybody
liked him - but he could go off and entertain himself for hours, he
didn’t seem to need toys or friends. He could be alone without being
lonely. The secrets our parents kept, though unknown to Chris and I, led
to bouts of rage and even violence between them that we had been forced
to witness since we were very young. It seemed like they never fought
without us. I remember the first family meeting to let Chris and me in
on their plans for getting a divorce. They wanted us to choose which of
them we’d live with. I cried my eyes out. But the divorce never
happened, though the threats and meetings never stopped. It wasn’t long
before Chris and I shut off – we would tell mom and dad to go ahead and
get the divorce. Chris and I just wanted to get away from their fights
and mom kept promising to get out and take us with her as soon as their
company made enough money. Dad had been the young genius NASA enlisted
to do designs for the American satellite radar systems that would be our
answer to the Russian Sputnik. And mom and he later started up a
consulting firm combining her get-up- and-go resourcefulness with his
wealth of knowledge. By the time the company actually made its first
million, the careerism and money seemed to erase her memory of the
promise she’d made us.</p>
<p><strong>carine</strong>: I think this is when Chris began to see
“careers” as a diseased invention of the twentieth century and to resent
money and the useless priority people made of it in their lives. He’d
begun planning to “slay the beast”…to make himself free.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I need a name.</p>
<p><strong>carine</strong>: Toward the end of June, Chris had mailed our
parents his final grade report.</p>
<p><strong>carine</strong>: Almost all A’s. “A” in Apartheid in South
African Society and History of Anthropological Thought; A- in
Contemporary African Politics and the Food Crisis in Africa; and on it
went. Clever boy, my brother.</p>
<p><strong>carine</strong>: But by the end of July we hadn’t heard
anything from him and my parents were getting very worried.</p>
<p><strong>carine</strong>: Chris had never had a phone, so they decided
to drive down to Atlanta and surprise him.</p>
<p><strong>carine</strong>: When they arrived at the apartment, there
was a “For Rent” sign in his window, and the manager told my parents
that Chris had moved out at the end of June.</p>
<p><strong>carine</strong>: When they got home, I had to hand them all
the letters they had sent Chris that summer which had been returned in a
bundle.</p>
<p><strong>carine</strong>: Chris had instructed the post office to hold
them until August 1st so that mom and dad wouldn’t know that anything
was up. Some part of me understood what he had done. That he had spent
the previous four years fulfilling an absurd and onerous duty in
graduating from college.</p>
<p><strong>carine</strong>: And now, at last he was unincumbered.
Emancipated from the stifling world of parents and peers. Abstraction,
security, and material excess. Those things that cut Chris off from the
raw truth of his existence. I only hoped he was safe…and I missed
him.</p>
<p><strong>tracking shot</strong>: CLOSE ON Chris, surrounded by a
summit grove embraced in its nature.</p>
<p><strong>angle</strong>: A DEER drinking from a creek, pops its head
up between trees and scrub, watching the alien human pass.</p>
<p><strong>angle</strong>: Chris - In his eyes we see the landscape
inject itself.</p>
<p><strong>sequence</strong>: Chris makes camp beside a stream pulling a
sack of rice from his backpack and cooking it.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Sign, sign. Everywhere a sign. Fuckin’ up the
scenery, breakin’ my mind.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Do this. Don’t do that. Can’t you read the
sign?</p>
<p><strong>forest ranger</strong>: U.S. Forestry. Could you step out of
the tent please?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Sorry. I thought you were a bear.</p>
<p><strong>forest ranger</strong>: I don’t blame you. You’re less than a
hundred yards from the nearest den. That’s why I came over here to talk
to you. Do you have some identification?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: No. I’m sorry. My name’s Alex. I’ve been
travelling a lot and I got robbed and my identification was taken.</p>
<p><strong>forest ranger</strong>: You mind if I take a look in your
tent?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>forest ranger</strong>: You’re not the character who knocked
down our sign, are ya?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>forest ranger</strong>: Because there was a sign indicating
that camping was allowed by permit only.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Well, I don’t have a permit.</p>
<p><strong>forest ranger</strong>: No, I’m sure you don’t. Listen, it
looks like you’ve got your food secured pretty good, so I’m not gonna
make you move on tonight. But, these bears out here are nursing young
and you know how that goes. Next time, stop at the Rangers station and
get yourself a permit.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Alright. I appreciate it. I’m gonna be headed
towards the coast tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>forest ranger</strong>: Be careful.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: conversation among</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: This is where I turn off.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Alright man. Thanks a lot.</p>
<p><strong>reverse</strong>: Chris, moving to the mysterious object. As
he lifts it, we see that it is a goofy looking straw hat. He dusts it
off, and snugs it onto his head, when a police car comes into frame and
stops beside Chris.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: How’re you doin’ this evening?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I’m alright. What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: You wanna put your backpack down on the
hood of my car.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Because I asked you to, sir.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: But I haven’t done anything wrong. These are
my personal items.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Do you know that it’s unlawful to
hitchhike on this stretch of highway.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You’re kidding.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Do you see a safe area for a vehicle to
stop? We got a tree-lined highway without a substantial shoulder here.
And we’ve had a lot of accidents on this road from people stopping in
the traffic lane for hitchhikers.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Alright, but…I mean, you stopped your car.
You’re in the traffic lane. And you can see, there’s hardly any cars out
here. Plus, it’s a straight road; you can see for a long ways.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: There’s really been accidents along here?</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: May I see some identification?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I don’t have any.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: You don’t have any identification?</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Well, I’m gonna site you for unlawful
hitchhiking. You don’t have to appear. You can send a check directly to
the Humboldt County Clerks Office for restitution. If you don’t pay it
within 30 days, you’re subject to fine and warrant. I’m gonna trust that
you’re gonna give me accurate information. What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: McCandless. Christopher Johnson
McCandless.</p>
<p><strong>carine</strong>: If Chris were trying to disappear, it would
have been a pretty uncharacteristic lapse for him to give the police his
real place of residence. Though my parents had already contacted the
Annandale police with their initial concerns, this ticket arriving from
California made them frantic.</p>
<p><strong>carine</strong>: My father called one of his old government
friends who put him in touch with a private investigator, someone who’d
done work with the DIA and the CIA. Using the Willow Creek ticket as a
starting point, the investigator began chasing down leads. Most of them
led far afield – to Europe and South Africa. Ultimately turning up
nothing. What my dad couldn’t believe was that he’d given up his car. He
seemed to love that Datsun so much. It sounded just like Chris to me,
though. He was very much of the school that you should own nothing
except what you could carry on your back at a dead run.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: Hi. We just barely saw you there, under that
crazy hat of yours. We couldn’t back up - the van’s reverse is
broken.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Oh. That’s okay. Thanks for stopping.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: This door’s a little tricky, I’ll get it.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: Hop in, that’s Rainey.</p>
<p><strong>rainey</strong>: Hey, I’m Rainey.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: And I’m Jan.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Hey, Rainey. Hi Jan. I’m Alex.</p>
<p><strong>rainey</strong>: Alex of the hat.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>rainey</strong>: Were you out there a long time hitching?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Couple of days. But sometimes I forget to put
my thumb out.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: Probably, the rest of the time, that hat scares
`em away.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: When’s the last time you ate something?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: See that? I’ve got this book and it shows you
all the plants and berries that are edible. You can find things wherever
you go.</p>
<p><strong>rainey</strong>: We were just in town getting some beads and
stuff. Jan does handicrafts, so we’re usually going from one swap meet
to another. She’s so good at what she does, we sold everything. So, we
set up camp at Orick Beach. You’re welcome to camp there with us.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: And eat there with us.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: So, I just left the car. It was a great car
too. I’d driven it cross country the first time when I got out of high
school. I had some really great adventures with it. That thing would
just go and go. I mean, it was an `82 but if I’d kept it, it would’ve
lasted me forever.</p>
<p><strong>rainey</strong>: So, you’re a leather now.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I’m a leather?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: What’s a leather?</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: You’re a leather tramp. That’s what they call
the ones that hoof it on foot. So, we’re technically rubber tramps.</p>
<p><strong>rainey</strong>: As we have a vee-hi-cle.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: Alex could have a vehicle. If he didn’t burn
his money. Why would you want to do that?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I don’t need money. It makes people
cautious.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: Well, you have to be a little cautious Alex.
That book of yours is all well and fine but you can’t depend entirely on
leaves and berries.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I don’t know if you’d want to depend on much
more than that.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: Where’s your mom and dad?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Makin’ their money somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: Come on Chris. You look like a loved kid. Be
fair.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Fair?</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: You know what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I’ll paraphrase Thoreau – “Rather than love,
than money, than fairness, give me truth.”</p>
<p><strong>rainey</strong>: You look like shit. There’s the truth.</p>
<p><strong>angle</strong>: Chris’ dog-ears his book and puts out the
lantern.</p>
<p><strong>angle</strong>: Rainey at the water’s edge. Chris appears
beside him.</p>
<p><strong>rainey</strong>: Geez. If I struck a match to you, I’d have
warmth and dinner at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Where’s Jan going?</p>
<p><strong>rainey</strong>: Well, my friend, all is not well on the
hippie front.</p>
<p><strong>rainey</strong>: You’re an industrious little fucker, aren’t
ya… Yeah, it’s funny how things happen at particular times. I’ve loved
that woman for a lot of years. But you know, she’s got a…story. We’ve
been going through this thing real quietly cause, well…So, after running
into you last night, this thing we were going through quietly, she
started talking about. You know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I think so.</p>
<p><strong>rainey</strong>: You think what?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I think she’s probably quietly disconnecting.
It doesn’t feel right to her to be close to you if there’s a hole of
some kind somewhere else.</p>
<p><strong>rainey</strong>: That’s a helluva insight. Jesus!… You’re not
Jesus, are you? You gonna walk on that water and get her back for
me?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Actually, I’m a little afraid of water.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: It’s true. But it’s something I’ve got to get
over sometime.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: So, I’ll swim in it if you’ll carry the
firewood back to the campsite.</p>
<p><strong>rainey</strong>: I’ll carry. Shit-yes I’ll carry.</p>
<p><strong>angle</strong>: Rainey. A warmth comes over him, watching his
old lady having some fun. He grabs two armfuls of wood and heads to the
campsite.</p>
<p><strong>angle</strong>: Chris and Jan swimming in the chilly water,
having a ball.</p>
<p><strong>rainey</strong>: I thought you guys might need a little
heat.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: That’s not hot enough. Put your arms around
me.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I’m going to go down the beach a ways and
read a little bit. I’ll bring the rest of that wood back before
nightfall.</p>
<p><strong>rainey</strong>: Alright. We might take a run into town to
grab some food for tonight.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Sounds good.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: You know what Alex ought to do, Rainey? He
ought to come out to the Slabs this winter.</p>
<p><strong>rainey</strong>: Oh yeah.</p>
<p><strong>rainey</strong>: You’d like that if you’re still on the road.
Lot of fellow travelers.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: What is that? The Slabs?</p>
<p><strong>rainey</strong>: It’s down in Niland, California. You know
where the Salton Sea is?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Near San Diego, yeah?</p>
<p><strong>rainey</strong>: Well about 200 miles Northeast of there, but
yeah. Niland’s off the east shore of Salton. Wild place. The navy
bulldozed and abandoned a base there. All that’s left is a grid of
concrete foundations. They’re scattered over about a square mile or
so.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: When the weather turns cold across the rest of
the country, people show up there by the thousands: snow birds…</p>
<p><strong>rainey</strong>: Drifters…</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: Sundry vagabonds…</p>
<p><strong>rainey / jan</strong>: Like ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: Livin’ on the cheap under the sun.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You sell your handcrafts there?</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: Oh yeah. And a lot of second-hand goods.
There’s a swap meet. The people are cool. There’s even some kids running
around sometimes. Most everyone there, if they’re not avoiding the cold,
are at least dodging the IRS.</p>
<p><strong>rainey</strong>: Or the FBI. CIA! DDT!!!</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: It’s good. You should check it out. If you
come, I’ll make a proper hat for you. Well, Alex. I’m gonna clean up and
the old man and I are gonna get some rest. Looks like you got yourself a
good bag there.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Yeah…my mother made it from a kit.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I’m gonna sleep out here by the fire. I want
to read a little bit.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: You’re wonderful. Don’t make me worry about
you.</p>
<p><strong>cu</strong>: Jan - We see her sadness. Rainey appears at her
shoulder. He understands what is inside his woman.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: He reminded me…</p>
<p><strong>rainey</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>foreground</strong>: Seagulls GLIDE THROUGH FRAME.</p>
<p><strong>music over</strong>: Joe Henry’s King’s Highway</p>
<p><strong>carine</strong>: In early September, mom and dad got a call
from the Annandale police notifying them that Chris’ abandoned car had
been identified by the Arizona Highway Patrol after a group of rare
flower hunters stumbled upon it in the desert. There were no signs that
Chris had intended to return to it. But there wasn’t any evidence of
struggle. The police said they thought Chris had chosen to leave it
behind and not that it had been taken from him. Nonetheless, the initial
comfort that gave mom and dad, quickly turned to their realization that
Chris was actually trying not to be found.</p>
<p><strong>carine</strong>: The year Chris graduated high school he
bought the Datsun, used. He wanted to drive it cross-country and visit
our old neighborhood in California. The day before he left was my dad’s
birthday. Chris made a speech…</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Dad, you and I have had our differences over
the years…but on your birthday I want to tell you how grateful I am for
all the things you’ve given me. And that you did it starting from
nothing to working your way through college and busting your ass to
support us kids. So, in return, I’ve been busting my ass a bit…at
Domino’s Pizza -</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: and I’ve gotten you this token, this damned
expensive token, as a token of that appreciation.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Would you look at that.</p>
<p><strong>carine</strong>: Jesus, you must’ve had a lot to drink.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Too much and not enough. I used to believe
all that stuff. That whole story. I thought maybe if I said it again,
I’d believe it. But I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>present</strong>: Walt expressionless, walking into
camera.</p>
<p><strong>carine</strong>: The day after the party, Chris left on his
trip and ended up staying away most of the summer. It was nearly three
months before he walked back into our house in Annandale. He had a
scruffy beard, his hair was long and tangled, and he was rail thin. As
soon as I heard he was home, I ran into his room to talk to him. In
California, he’d looked up some old family friends who still lived
there. He’d found out that long after he had been born, our dad had
continued a relationship with his first wife Marcia in secret.</p>
<p><strong>carine</strong>: And that one lie had led to another. That
two years after Chris was born, dad had had another son with Marcia.
Worse yet was that it was Marcia to whom he was still legally married at
the time. And it was Chris and I who were the bastard children.</p>
<p><strong>carine</strong>: Dad’s arrogance made him conveniently
oblivious to the pain he caused. And mom, in the shame and embarrassment
of a young mistress, became his accomplice.</p>
<p><strong>carine</strong>: She and my dad had decided to bend the truth
about this other child saying that dad wasn’t the father and they
maintained that their fraudulent marriage was real.</p>
<p><strong>carine</strong>: Chris was quiet when he told me this. He
said it made his “entire childhood seem like a fiction”; that “the truth
had been dying everyday.” If something bothered Chris, he’d usually keep
it to himself. And he made me promise to do the same.</p>
<p><strong>carine</strong>: He never did tell mom and dad that he knew.
But Chris measured himself and those around him by an impossibly
rigorous moral code. He loathed what he considered mom and dad’s
hypocrisy and resented what they considered guidance. Chris submitted to
dad’s authority through college but I knew he raged inwardly the whole
time. It was inevitable that Chris would rebel. And when he did, he did
it with characteristic immoderation.</p>
<p><strong>carine</strong>: My father is a brilliant man. But he had
made some terrible mistakes. And to some extent, it seemed Chris was
making him pay an awful price.</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: moving forward with the truck, his knees
rattling up</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Hi Wayne. Alex McCandless.</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: Seems like every time I come on this road,
there’s somebody hitching out here who looks as skinny and unfed as
you.</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: Look, I gotta stop in Ethridge to drop
something off</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: How `bout you and I grab something to eat
down there?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Oh, I wouldn’t want to burden you.</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: How long has it been since you’ve had
anything to eat?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Couple of days. I kinda ran out of money.</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: Well, there’s no choice about it. I’m gonna
get you some dinner.</p>
<p><strong>56 ext. sunburst - night 56</strong>: Wayne’s truck cuts
through a track in a wheat field moving toward a compound of three
trailers, one a double- wide, the other two on wheels, smaller. Beside
them, a Wyeth-esque farmhouse. He eases the engine and comes to a stop
in front of the double-wide.</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: So where is it you’re headed?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I was thinking about doubling back through
the Canadian side of Glacier Park.</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: Yeah, I used to have a girlfriend who’d go
there, camp on the Black Feet Res. She was into all that American Indian
stuff.</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: I can bring you to the border at Sweet Grass
once you’ve had some food.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Well, that’d be great. What do you do out
here?</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: Well, I do a lot of things. Computer
programming. Video game repair. I’m a licensed pilot, own a grain
elevator in Carthage and another one a few miles out of town. But in the
summertime I run a combine crew, follow the harvest from Texas way the
hell north to the Canadian border. We just got done cutting barley for
Coors and Anheuser Busch. But then I got this little black box deal on
the side</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You mean those free satellite TV deals?</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: You said it, not me.</p>
<p><strong>ooooooh.</strong>: Chris doesn’t respond, digs into the food.
Points to the unconscious tribe splayed out. SIX GERMANIC-LOOKING</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Who are these guys?</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: Those are my Hudderites. Agriculture’s a
pretty transient business. These guys come off the Hudderite colony
looking for work. I always got work for people. Then that guy -</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: That’s Kevin. He’s with me most of the time.
He’s not a Hudderite. He’s from Madison.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Madison. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: Listen, you don’t want to go out there on the
road tonight. Why don’t you just roll your sleeping bag out and play
like a Hudderite until morning.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Thanks Wayne. I will.</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: Get a good sleep. See you in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: Okay. Now take hold of the joystick, get the
feel of header, idle it down with the toggle switch…</p>
<p><strong>wide shot</strong>: Chris and Wayne sit atop a combine. In
the background we see Wayne’s trailer and two other combines piloted by
Wayne’s crew members on the ocean of ripe blond grain.</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: That’s it. That’s it. Now take it on out and
make yourself some money.</p>
<p><strong>61 int. double-wide, sunburst - night 61</strong>: Six men
including Wayne and Chris, two among them - Hudderites, crowd in to the
small dinner area of the trailer. Talking politics and bullshit, and
eating a welcome meal.</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: I’m gonna break out some whiskey. Alex, you
want anything other than that beer?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I’d take a White Russian if you’ve got
it.</p>
<p><strong>man #1</strong>: What are you Alex, a Commie?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: No, I just like White Russians.</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: I haven’t got anything like that here. But I
tell ya what. And I know I speak for everybody. You wanna come work with
us in Carthage, we’ll hook you up on the grain elevator and get you a
White Russian down at the Cabaret.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: Dawn tomorrow, engines roaring. “Pot o Gold.
Oh that pot o gold.”</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: “Pot o Gold. Gotta get that pot o gold!”</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: To Carthage.</p>
<p><strong>wayne and his men</strong>: To Carthage.</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: Okay Kevin, get all the machines back to the
elevator. I’m gonna show Chris to his room.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I’ve got dibs on that shower, that shower’s
all me.</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: First come, first serve buddy.</p>
<p><strong>67 int. westerberg’s carthage home - same 67</strong>: Chris
follows Wayne up the narrow stairwell.</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: Come on up in here. This’ll be your room for
as long as you hang about.</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: Shower’s down the hall. If you hurry you can
beat the rest of the boys to it. But you do want to grab a shower cause
we’re all heading over to the Cabaret in exactly thirty-six minutes. So,
get your dancing shoes on. There’s foo-foo in the medicine cabinet. I
think it’s Brut. Then you want to put your charm in overdrive cause we
like to PAH-TAY!</p>
<p><strong>man #1</strong>: I got first!</p>
<p><strong>man #2</strong>: You had first last night!</p>
<p><strong>man #1</strong>: Well, if you wanna wash my back, cowboy…</p>
<p><strong>man #2</strong>: You go ahead, fairy. Just don’t use all the
soap.</p>
<p><strong>angle</strong>: Chris. He gets a kick out of these guys. He
closes the door.</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: Alex, this is Gail . This is the one to go to
for that White Russian you’ve been wanting. Of course the quid pro quo
can be hazardous.</p>
<p><strong>gail</strong>: Shut up, Wayne. You want a White Russian,
sweetie?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Yes please, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: Yes please, ma’am?</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: Ain’t he great?</p>
<p><strong>gail</strong>: Don’t pay any attention to him.</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: Anything to do with hunting, preserving the
meat, smoking it or whatever, you talk to Kevin over there. That’s your
man.</p>
<p><strong>angle</strong>: KEVIN. He looks every bit the Grizzly Adams
part.</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: Outdoors-man. What’s the interest in all
that?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I’m thinking about going to Alaska.</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: Alaska, Alaska? Or city Alaska? The city
Alaska does have markets.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: No, Alaska, Alaska. I want to be all the way
out there. On my own. No map. No watch. No axe. Just out there. Big
mountains, rivers, sky. Game. Just be out there in it. In the wild.</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: In the wild.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Yeah. Maybe write a book about my travels.
About getting out of this sick society.</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: Society, right.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Because you know what I don’t understand? I
don’t understand why, why people are so bad to each other, so often. It
just doesn’t make any sense to me. Judgement. Control. All that.</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: Who “people” we talking about?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You know, parents and hypocrites. Politicians
and pricks.</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: This is a mistake. It’s a mistake to get too
deep into that kind of stuff. Alex, you’re a helluva young guy, but I
promise you this: You’re a young guy. Blood and fire! You’re juggling
blood and fire!</p>
<p><strong>gail</strong>: Who are you to be giving advice to
anybody?</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: Blood and fire…What? Mr. Happy. That’s who I
am. Gimme a kiss.</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: Come on, give Mr. Happy a kiss!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Now, that’s who could be President!</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: Workin’ time!</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: So, what do you think about all this?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I like all this.</p>
<p><strong>angles</strong>: Tires kicking up dust on dirt roads, through
town, and into the field behind the grain elevator. Back to the work,
back to the tires. Back to the work, back to these several cars hauling
ass through the field. Back to Wayne, up high in the grain elevator
-</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: I gotta take a piss.</p>
<p><strong>man #1</strong>: I warned him about those little black
boxes.</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: You wanna get that zipper for me? Sorry boys.
Gonna have to shut down for a while. Alex! You come back and work for me
anytime. Gail’s got all your checks, guys. I shouldn’t be away too
long.</p>
<p><strong>gail</strong>: Where are you gonna go?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I’ve been thinking a lot about Alaska.</p>
<p><strong>gail</strong>: Alaska? What kind of nut-nut are you? Alex,
it’s October for Christ’s sake. You go to Alaska, you go in the Spring.
This time of year you wanna head south. Personally, I like Las Vegas.
One-armed bandit. That’s what I like.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Yeah, maybe I ought to put off going to
Alaska, at least so I can get settled up there in decent weather.</p>
<p><strong>gail</strong>: South. You want to go south. You want me to
take you out to the highway?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Little lady, I walked in, I can walk out.</p>
<p><strong>gail</strong>: You take care of yourself now, Alex. You got a
whole family here depending on it.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I will. Thanks Gail . And tell Wayne, I’ll
drop him a line.</p>
<p><strong>series of angles</strong>: MUSIC OVER: Traveling shots.</p>
<p><strong>series of angles</strong>: Chris walking south through the
desert following the river bank. He covers twelve miles before he
arrives in an Arizona town, a dusty weigh-in station.</p>
<p><strong>green suit</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Yeah. If I wanted to paddle down the river,
where’s the best place to launch out of?</p>
<p><strong>green suit</strong>: “To launch out of?” What’s your
experience level?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Not much.</p>
<p><strong>green suit</strong>: Any? Do you have a permit?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: A permit for what?</p>
<p><strong>green suit</strong>: You can’t paddle down the river without
a permit. If you like, you can apply for one here, get yourself some
experience, and I’ll put you on the wait-list.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Wait-list? To paddle down a river?</p>
<p><strong>green suit</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Well, how long do you have to wait?</p>
<p><strong>green suit</strong>: I’ve got an opening May 2003.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Twelve years?</p>
<p><strong>green suit</strong>: Well, you could always join a commercial
raft trip and go with a licensed guide. They usually have a few last
minute cancellations. I think it’s about two- thousand dollars.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Thanks for your help.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I’m Superman. SuperTramp.</p>
<p><strong>low angle</strong>: It is a narrow gorge of solid rock,
looking up from hundreds of feet below the canyon crest.</p>
<p><strong>mads</strong>: Hello!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>mads</strong>: You can join us!</p>
<p><strong>mads</strong>: We have hotdogs!</p>
<p><strong>mads</strong>: I am Mads.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Hi. Alex.</p>
<p><strong>sonja</strong>: I am Sonja.</p>
<p><strong>sonja</strong>: Hello Alex.</p>
<p><strong>mads</strong>: We are from Copenhagen. And you are from the
rapids.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I am.</p>
<p><strong>sonja</strong>: My Got!</p>
<p><strong>mads</strong>: Crazy man. You’re a crazy man! Sonja, he is a
crazy man. I’ll make you a hotdog.</p>
<p><strong>mads</strong>: Just one minute. One minute…</p>
<p><strong>mads</strong>: I love this. Don’t you love this? This is
nature. We see it in the American movies. How come you’re crazy?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>mads</strong>: Because that’s crazy! You come down the
rapids. What do you want on your hotdog? Mustard and relish?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You have ketchup?</p>
<p><strong>mads</strong>: No, I have mustard and relish.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Mustard and relish it is then.</p>
<p><strong>mads</strong>: Sonja, you want a hotdog?</p>
<p><strong>sonja</strong>: Of course I want a hotdog. Why are you
stupid?</p>
<p><strong>mads</strong>: She asked me why I’m stupid. And I say,
well…like I ask you why you’re crazy and you say “well.” Where are you
going?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I haven’t decided.</p>
<p><strong>mads</strong>: We like it here very much. We went to Los
Angeles. And then, we went to Las Vegas.</p>
<p><strong>sonja</strong>: Las Vegas is very nice. The universe is very
good.</p>
<p><strong>mads</strong>: And then, we come here. Maybe you go to
Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>mads</strong>: You can take kayak around Lake Mead and then
take the river down to Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: How far are we from Lake Mead?</p>
<p><strong>mads</strong>: Sonja, how far is Hoover Dam?</p>
<p><strong>sonja</strong>: Maybe three hundred thirty kilometers…like
two hundred miles.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Man, I wonder if I could go all the way down
into the Gulf of California.</p>
<p><strong>mads</strong>: I go with you. We leave Sonja here. You and me
in kayak - we go to Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>sonja</strong>: You’re embarrassing. Idiot.</p>
<p><strong>mads</strong>: I like the meeting you.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Thank you. I’m very happy to meet both of you
too.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Well, guys I really appreciate the
hospitality but I wanna make camp down- river a ways so I better take
off before dark.</p>
<p><strong>mads</strong>: He went thattaway! The crazy man - he went
thattaway!</p>
<p><strong>sonja</strong>: Just like in the movies.</p>
<p><strong>carine</strong>: It would be Christmas in a couple of months.
And the last news we’d had was about his car being found. I woke up a
couple of days ago, and for the first time, I was surprised to realize
that it wasn’t only my parents who hadn’t heard from Chris. I wondered
why he hadn’t tried to call in case I might answer. He could’ve hung up
if it wasn’t me.</p>
<p><strong>carine</strong>: But why he didn’t send a letter, maybe
through a friend. I got mad. But I told myself it was good. It made me
remember that there was something more than rebellion, more than anger
that was driving him. Chris had always been driven, had always been an
adventurer. When he was four years old…</p>
<p><strong>carine</strong>: …he once wandered six blocks away from home
at three o’clock in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>carine</strong>: He was found in a neighbor’s kitchen, up on
a chair, digging into their candy drawer.</p>
<p><strong>carine</strong>: Whatever drawer he was opening now must have
something sweet in it.</p>
<p><strong>angle</strong>: Chris: The herd moves in an S-pattern. Chris
runs beside them and in our LONG LENS PERSPECTIVE, he seems to be among
them.</p>
<p><strong>94 ext. yuma post office - day 94</strong>: CONTINUE letter
OVER:</p>
<p><strong>pov</strong>: Morelos Dam at the Mexican border.</p>
<p><strong>immigration officer</strong>: Why’d you go to Mexico?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I thought I’d run the whole river into the
Sea of Cortez. The stupid dams dried it up.</p>
<p><strong>immigration officer</strong>: How long were you on your own
down there?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: 36 days.</p>
<p><strong>immigration officer</strong>: How’d you know?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Fingers and toes.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: After the river dried up, I ported the kayak
and got a lift to Golfo.</p>
<p><strong>foreground and background</strong>: Chris, paddling his kayak
toward us, seemingly in the sand dunes. As we BOOM UP SLIGHTLY, we see
that there is a bend in the water’s edge and that he is in fact,
paddling in the crystalline blue of the Gulf.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I paddled south about 20 miles.</p>
<p><strong>under-water shot</strong>: We are directly UNDER the passing
kayak as it slices the water’s surface above us. We BACKFLIP the CAMERA
as it passes.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: That’s when I saw the cave and everything
went upside down.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: A sandstorm hit and I was pretty much stuck.
My kayak blew away, so I left it and walked up the beach, hitched back
north, and here I am.</p>
<p><strong>immigration officer</strong>: 36 days, wow. I guess they’re
gonna have to watch that spillway a little better.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: What they ought to do is open up the dams and
let the rivers flow.</p>
<p><strong>immigration officer</strong>: I can’t disagree with you on
that. Okay, Alexander SuperTramp. I think we’re gonna let you out of
here shortly but you’ve got two working weeks to get an ID card in the
United States. You can’t be crossing these borders without
identification, are we understood?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Yes, sir. I’ve eaten enough sand to send me
back to the city anyway.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: One…Two…Three -</p>
<p><strong>angle</strong>: Dangling feet and razor sharp wheels.</p>
<p><strong>angle</strong>: Chris. He puts everything into pulling
himself up, growling the strength into his muscles finally…</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: As Alexander Supertramp returns to
civilization…a hobo. I’m a for real hobo.</p>
<p><strong>119 ext. train yard, los angeles - day 119</strong>: Chris’

jumps off and breaks for the fence unseen.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Can you tell me how to get an ID card?</p>
<p><strong>social worker</strong>: Did you lose your identification
sir?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>social worker</strong>: No birth certificate? Nothing?</p>
<p><strong>social worker</strong>: Ouch. Alright. Well you’re gonna have
to work that out with the DMV. You can catch them in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>social worker</strong>: The closest one is Montebello and we
can help you with a bus voucher.</p>
<p><strong>social worker</strong>: So, just come to this desk when you
need the voucher.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: And, if I want to apply for a job somewhere,
can you help me with that?</p>
<p><strong>social worker</strong>: If you know how to cook, we might
have a space for you in our mobile kitchen. But I’ll have to talk to my
supervisor about it in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Alright then. Thank you. Oh, one last thing.
Do you have a bed for me?</p>
<p><strong>social worker</strong>: Sure. Just fill this in and I’ll get
you all set up.</p>
<p><strong>cu</strong>: The lock, as Chris closes and secures his
locker.</p>
<p><strong>new angle</strong>: Chris walking down Broadway. This is
clearly just blocks away from where we last saw him, yet the atmosphere
is as if of a different world. One of those downtown LA hip yuppie
blocks. He comes upon a bar. Through the window Chris sees young men and
women roughly his own age - working people, suits, gold-chainers.

<p><strong>social worker</strong>: You leaving us so soon? I know them
DMV lines are long…</p>

<p><strong>bull #2</strong>: Lay down on your stomach, spread eagle!</p>
<p><strong>bull #2</strong>: Let me see your face.</p>
<p><strong>bull #2</strong>: I never, ever, ever forget a face. If I see
yours again, I won’t arrest you. I’ll kill you. This is the god-damned
railroad. And we will do whatever we have to, to keep you freeloaders
from violating our liability.</p>
<p><strong>bull #2</strong>: If one of you people gets hurt on our
train, we are liable. Do you understand that?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I’m sorry, sir.</p>
<p><strong>bull #2</strong>: You have I.D.?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>bull #2</strong>: Of course you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>bull #2</strong>: Last time, my friend.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Thanks very much.</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: I’m not talking about this anymore!</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Don’t walk away from me WOMAN!</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: Fuck you! I hate you!</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I’ll just cancel Christmas then!</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: Who do you think you are? God?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Yes. I’m God!</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Where do you kids think you’re going?</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: as a demand for their</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I’ll cancel Christmas!</p>
<p><strong>carine</strong>: Who do you think you are? God?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Yes. I’m God.</p>
<p><strong>carine</strong>: In the nine months since Chris’
disappearance, my parents went through enormous changes. Guilt was
giving way to pain. And pain seemed to bring them closer. My father had
humbled dramatically. And what had always been a sort of curt arrogance,
the kind of man who actually thought he could cancel Christmas, had
given way to the vulnerability of a father’s heart. Even their faces had
changed. It made me sad that I couldn’t share with Chris the new
closeness I felt toward our parents.</p>
<p><strong>carine</strong>: I close my eyes at night sometimes and
imagine where Chris might be.</p>
<p><strong>carine</strong>: Was there beauty around him? Was he hurt?
Was he alone?</p>
<p><strong>carine</strong>: Was he having the great adventure that he
wanted?</p>
<p><strong>carine</strong>: Could he feel the changes here at home? By
some kind of supernatural osmosis? Chris once wrote to me from college
saying he wanted to talk to me about all the problems he had with mom
and dad.</p>
<p><strong>carine</strong>: He said I was the only person in the world
who could’ve possibly understood what he had to say.</p>
<p><strong>high angle cu</strong>: We see Chris walking the streets of
Seattle. As we WIDEN OUT, he becomes a dot in the Seattle landscape.</p>
<p><strong>carine</strong>: In those silent moments, with my eyes closed
trying to picture where Chris might be at that very moment, probably
climbing some scary mountain, I want to reach into that picture and
bring him back to see what mom and dad, what our family might
become.</p>
<p><strong>long lens</strong>: Chris disappears over the rise into the
Seattle marketplace overlooking Puget Sound</p>
<p><strong>carine</strong>: But instead when I open my eyes, what I see
is my mother, sitting at the dining room table, sifting through photo
albums and pictures of Chris. It’s all she can do to examine the
snapshots. And, though she breaks down from time to time, she studies
them with a sort of hungry intensity - like looking at food you can’t
eat, or into a window at a family around a table that you were once a
part of and can be no more.</p>
<p><strong>carine</strong>: She convinces herself it’s Chris; that it’s
her son, whenever she passes a stray. And I fear for the mother in
her…</p>
<p><strong>carine</strong>: Instincts that seem to sense the threat of a
loss so huge and irreparable that the mind balks at taking its measure -
I begin to wonder if I do understand what Chris is saying any longer.
But I catch myself in doubt and remember that these are not the parents
he grew up with. That in the forced reflection that comes with loss,
indeed everything Chris is saying, has to be said. And I trust for him
that everything he is doing has to be done. This is our life.</p>
<p><strong>trucker</strong>: I don’t know where to drop you. Bullhead’s
kinda haphazard - there’s no “center.” You sure you don’t want to be in
Laughlin? It’s casinos versus chiropractors.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Yeah, no. This is good. Right here.</p>
<p><strong>trucker</strong>: Alright then. Chiropractors it is.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Chris, you gotta go faster. We’ve got a line
out the door.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Chris, I don’t mean to be on you about
everything. You’re doing a great job.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: I want to keep you on. And we all want to help
you get to Alaska, but you’ve got to start wearing socks.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Right, right. I forgot.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: And please. Hurry. We’re ten deep.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: How much do I have in the account now?</p>
<p><strong>teller</strong>: It looks like…let me see. Including this
latest deposit…One thousand, two hundred and fifty two dollars
and…twenty-two cents.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: What’s the interest on twenty-two cents?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Lori, I’m punching out.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Okay. Just put it in the drop.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: No, I mean I’m punching out for good.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: We’ve made our quota, have we?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Yeah. Also, I’ve got to do some things before
I head north.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Alright Chris. Well, we’ve enjoyed knowing
you. I won’t be able to get that last check to you right away
though.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: That’s okay. I’ll let you know where to send
it.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Alright then Chris. Bye-bye now.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Bye-bye.</p>
<p><strong>continue music over:</strong>: Chris gets a clean shave and a
whore’s bath.</p>
<p><strong>cu</strong>: Chris</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: Sunni! Come here boy.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Surprise!</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: Alex!</p>
<p><strong>angle</strong>: Rainey hearing his name, jumps up from his
stool to join them.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: You have to tell us everything.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: I think you’ve made yourself a friend.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: She’s only a teenager.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>rainey</strong>: How long can you stay with us?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Well, I’m waiting on a check from my last job
to come into Salton City the day after Christmas. I’ve got to start
thinking about getting ready for Alaska. When the sun gets a little
lower tonight, I’m going to start a calisthenics routine. I think after
the check comes in, I’ll try to find some mountains I can climb everyday
till spring comes. I gotta see how far the money’s gonna go.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I’m going to have to pick up a lot of
supplies before spring. So, I might take another job or I might be
okay.</p>
<p><strong>rainey</strong>: Well, you know, we’ll give you a little
something for every day you work the booth.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I’m not taking any money from you, Rainey.
It’s been a real great twist meeting you two. You look like you’re doing
good.</p>
<p><strong>rainey</strong>: We are, and you were a big part of that,
coming along when you did. Yep, things are good. Man, I used to think
Tantric sex was just a bunch of reading. Speaking of which, don’t you
think you ought to introduce yourself to Joni Mitchell over there?</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: You selling books?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I am. We are.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: I read a lot.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Do you?</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: That’s good. I heard you play your song last
night.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: I’m terrible.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You are not terrible.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: I’m not?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: No. You sing sweet.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Thank you. I was going to go watch the kids
play in the mud. Do you want to go?</p>
<p><strong>rainey</strong>: Go on. I’ll watch the store.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I’m sorry. This is Rainey. And I’m Chris.</p>
<p><strong>rainey</strong>: Hi. Rainey. And this is Alex.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: I’m Tracy.</p>
<p><strong>long lens</strong>: We watch Chris and Tracy sit pit-side
with a foreground of frolicking naked children splashing about in the
mud. We don’t hear their conversation. We just watch its gentleness.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: I wasn’t much older than Tracy when I got
pregnant. And I thought my husband and I were going to invent peace on
earth and stay together forever. But it didn’t work out that way. He
left. History. Now ancient history. And that was the end of that. So, I
raised Reno by myself - that’s my son. Then I met Rainey. And that was
really good for a while. But Reno was already a teenager and was
becoming a man in his own way. And then, I don’t know. He kinda followed
in his father’s footsteps - out the door and gone. And I really don’t
know where he is. I haven’t heard from him in two years.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I hope I get to meet him sometime.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: Do your folks know where you are?</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Soup’s on. Oh, I’m sorry. Are you guys
getting heavy?</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: No, sweetheart. Just hungry. You’ve been doing
a fantastic job over there. Shall we eat?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>rainey</strong>: I really ought to get myself doing that.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You should Rainey. Makes that Tantric stuff
go even better.</p>
<p><strong>rainey</strong>: How the hell would you know? That poor girl
over there is about ready to vault onto a fence post. And here you are,
the monk of Jack LaLane.</p>
<p><strong>rainey</strong>: I guess Jan filled you in. About Reno and
everything. Children can be harsh judges when it comes to their parents.
They don’t grant clemency easily. I think Reno tended to see things in
black and white. I just hope he lives long enough to forgive her.</p>
<p><strong>rainey</strong>: But painful as it is, you turned a light on
in her and I’m grateful.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Me too.</p>
<p><strong>rainey</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>rainey</strong>: Do your folks know where you are?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>rainey</strong>: Don’t you think they ought to?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: They should. But I can’t. Not yet, anyway. I
got a sister though, Carine. She’s the most beautiful girl in the world.
But, it’s all got to stay behind me until I get where I’m going.</p>
<p><strong>rainey</strong>: Alaska?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Yeah, Rainey. Alaska.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Hello? Merry Christmas?</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Come in here.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Guess what.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: My parents went into town.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Yes, they did. They went to call my grandma
for Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: No, I mean, no, we can’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: How old are you?</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Eighteen.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Seventeen.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: What year were you born?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You want to do something together?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You can always get in touch with me by
sending mail here. I don’t know when I’ll get it, but I’ll get it.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You’re pretty magic.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: I am?</p>
<p><strong>rainey</strong>: You take care of yourself, kiddo.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You too, Rainey. Thanks for everything.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: New Year’s resolution?</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: Just get your pack out of the back and get out
of here. I can’t take a hug.</p>
<p><strong>telephoto lens</strong>: A long two-laned road before us
rises and falls in a series of saddles and peaks. The narrow shoulders
are densely wooded. SLOWLY APPEARING over the near most peak, a TEAM OF
EIGHT SHIRTLESS HIGH SCHOOL RUNNERS. Leading the group - 17 YEAR-OLD
CHRISTOPHER MCCANDLESS. Lean, softly handsome, and graceful.</p>
<p><strong>carine</strong>: In high school, Chris became captain of the
cross-country track team. They called themselves the Road Warriors.</p>
<p><strong>reverse angle</strong>: The group of young runners, led by
Chris suddenly veer off the paved road into the adjoining woods.</p>
<p><strong>series of angles</strong>: The runners, led by Chris, pace
unchartered trails, grassy hillsides, and shallow streams.</p>
<p><strong>carine</strong>: He’d take them on what he loved to refer to
as “epic” runs. The whole point was to run until they were completely
lost and so exhausted that they were on the verge of puking. Then they’d
slow down a little, somehow he’d find their bearings, and lead them home
again at full speed. This was my brothers idea of fun.</p>
<p><strong>carine</strong>: A year and a half into Chris’ disappearance,
each day that goes by now feels like two. Dad calls it “suspended
animation.” I kept telling myself that he had to get lost to prove his
independence to himself. But this was no day run for the Road Warriors
and after so much time, I could no longer keep out the haunting
thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>carine</strong>: In many ways, my life and even my parents
had begun to move in new directions. I’d fallen in love. And mom and dad
had even ventured out on a brief vacation. But, when a search of tax
records uncovered Chris’ contribution to OXFAM, the weight of his
disappearance just seemed to lie down on us full length.</p>
<p><strong>wide shot</strong>: We see the Oh My God Hot Springs.
Steaming pools lined with rocks and shaded by palm trees. A small group
of campers and Charlie Manson wannabes in</p>
<p><strong>slo mo</strong>: We are looking down a radically steep rock
face. A shirtless Chris is in training running towards us under the hot
desert sun.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Hey boy. You are a handsome fellow. Beautiful
dog.</p>
<p><strong>the girl</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Go on, boy. Go on.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: Where’s your camp?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Out past Oh-My-God Hot Springs.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: I’ve lived in and around here six years now and
I’ve never heard of any place that goes by that name.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: Show me how to get there.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: Ron Franz.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Alex.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: Alex. Where are you from Alex?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: West Virginia.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: Okay, Alex from West Virginia. I like a fellow
who doesn’t raise the pitch of his voice when he talks to animals…shows
he doesn’t condescend.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You go left here.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: You live here?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: No, we keep going. I’m further up. Another
half-mile or so, out on the Bajada.</p>
<p><strong>185 ext. chris’ camp beside the stone wall - same
185</strong>: Ron and Chris drive up in the truck. Ron shuts off the
ignition and gets out of the truck to stretch his legs. Chris follows,
puts his full water jug under the tarp at his campsite, hooking it onto
a branch. He throws his shoulder bag with the rice in it into his
backpack.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: Well, this is somethin’ out here. Don’t you
worry about those dope smokers and nudists down below there?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: No, they keep to themselves pretty much and
so do I.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: Hmmm. You strike me as a bright young man. Am I
wrong about that?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I think I got my head on my shoulders pretty
good.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: That’s what I mean. How long have you been out
here?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Couple of weeks.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: And before that?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: A lot of places. I’ve been moving around.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: How old are you?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Twenty-three.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: Twenty-three years old! Son, don’t you think
you should be getting an education? And a job? And making something of
this life?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Look Mr. Franz. I think careers are a
twentieth century invention and I don’t want one. You don’t need to
worry about me. I have a college education. I’m not destitute. I’m
living like this by choice.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: In the dirt?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Yeah, in the dirt.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: I just don’t know. Where’s your family?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Don’t have one anymore.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: That’s a shame.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Hey, Mr. Franz. I want to show you
something.</p>
<p><strong>angle</strong>: The two men nearly half way to the summit.
It’s getting steeper and higher. Ron stops.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: This is getting a little steep. And a little
high for me kid.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Alright. But look out there. Even from half
way out, it’s quite a sight isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: From the top you can see all the way to the
Salton Sea too.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: You can see the Salton Sea from up there?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: My goodness.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You don’t want to go up?</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: Nope. I don’t do these kind of things.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: How about you and me take a drive? About fifty
miles or so up highway, I know a place that’s got a view, great food,
and requires no climbing. How’s that sound?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Yeah, sure. It’ll take me a couple of minutes
to clean up.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: Fair enough.</p>
<p><strong>vertical pov</strong>: We are thousands of feet in the air
over the rigid rocky canyon as we ascend toward San Jacinto summit. It’s
high. Scary HIGH.</p>
<p><strong>music over</strong>: As Chris and Ron ride the tram to the
peak, we watch Chris watching Ron, his kind, moist old eyes, slowly
blinking at the wonder of the nature around him. Other passengers on the
tram seem nervous, but Ron is meditative, almost hypnotized.</p>
<p><strong>190 int. elevation restaurant - twilight90</strong>: 1</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: How old are you, Mr. Franz?</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: Seventy-nine years old.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Seventy-nine…see, all due respect, but the
real difference between people is the quality of their soul and not on
how long they’ve trudged around like a dip-shit.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: But it’s true.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: It is. No question about that.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: The government’s the same as my parents. They
don’t respect anybody. Regulation. Regulation. Regulation. WE can’t do
this. But THEY can do that. I mean, the hypocrisy of the whole…culture.
Makes me crazy. My father was having children with two women at the same
time, and then has the gall to think that he can be of some guidance to
me? Make judgments on me? My mother, of course, goes along with all of
it. Keeps the secret, which of course, makes my whole life a fiction.
Everything I thought was, wasn’t. They’re such fools! Fucking
idiots!</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: Alex, please don’t lump me in amongst your
judges. And your tyrants. But I’d prefer to not hear that kind of
language.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Sorry. I don’t usually use that kind of
language either. I just get so angry thinking about it.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: You got a lot of passion, young man.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Awww, that was a great time Mr. Franz. Thank
you.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: Look here. If Charles Manson and his buddies
don’t kill me on my way out of here, I’d like to cook you up a home
cooked meal tomorrow night. If I come out here about, say, four o’clock
tomorrow, how would that be?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: That would be swell.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: Good, good. I’m no gourmet but I know where the
spices are. Good night, kid.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Good night Mr. Franz.</p>
<p><strong>high angle</strong>: Chris, looking at his own reflection in
the water below Ron’s dock. In the reflection, we see his hands full of
dirty laundry.</p>
<p><strong>195 int. kitchen, ron’s house - same 195</strong>: Ron broils
a couple of steaks. Chris enters and moves past Ron carrying his laundry
into another room.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: Did you find everything you need?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Yeah. I hope I don’t wreck your machine.
There’s a lot of grime in that stuff.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: Well, that’s what it’s for. How do these steaks
look?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: Well, sit down.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: What do you drink?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You got a White Russian?</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Beer?</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: Nope. Don’t have any alcohol. I had to quit all
that. How about a guava juice?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I’ll take a guava juice, that sounds
good.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: Yeah, I had a little spell with the bottle, you
could say.</p>
<p><strong>ron/chris</strong>: Cheers.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: I spent most of my life in the army. On New
Year’s Eve 1957, I was stationed over in Okinawa. My wife and son were
here in the States, just driving down the road when a fellow who’d had
too much to drink plowed right into them. Killed them both. Anyway, you
might think that the last thing in the world I’d do, is go to the
whiskey, but at the time, it felt like the only thing I could do. And I
did it hard. But pretty soon, I figured I wasn’t doing my wife and son
any good, mourning them with a bottle. So, I pulled myself together and
quit drinking, cold turkey. And then…</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: You see all these kids over here?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Yeah, I was gonna ask you.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: Yeah, that’s… Fuki, Kenjiro, Yoshiko, Keiko,
Masaro, Junichi, Kimpei, Nayoko…</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: And this is Akira. Just finished medical
school.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: Yeah, I unofficially adopted all of them. It
did my heart some good but I guess really it was just writing a few
letters and sending some money. Anyway, it was important to me. I get a
letter from each of them from time to time. You know. So, since all
that, this is pretty much me.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Do you ever travel, Mr. Franz?</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: No. I can’t seem to get too far from my
leather. I’ll show you after you finish eating. I do a lot of leather
engraving. I got a little workshop in the garage. Between that and my
pension, I do pretty well. But every time I think I might take a trip
somewhere, I get too far behind on orders and such to consider it.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Well, I’m finished eating. I’d love to see
your workshop.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: Would ya?</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: Alright then.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: How about some fishing?</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: That thing’s twice as salty as the ocean. Did
you know that?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Anything alive in it?</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: What’s the N stand for?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: …North.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: Alaska?</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: Son, what the hell you running from?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I could ask you the same question. Except I
already know the answer.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: You do, do you?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I do, Mr. Franz. You’ve got to get back out
in the world. Get out of that lonely house of yours, that little
workshop, and go live on the road.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Really. You’re going to live a long time,
Ron. You should make a radical change in your lifestyle. The core of
man’s spirit comes with new experiences. And there you are, stubborn old
man, sitting on your butt.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: Sittin’ on my butt, huh?</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: I’ll show you sittin’ on my butt.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: “Stubborn old man.”</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Come on, old man! Come on!</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: Ya little pinhead.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: Ya little pinhead.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You alright?</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: I’m going to miss you when you go.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I’ll miss you too, Ron. But you’re wrong if
you think the joy of life comes principally from human relationships.
God’s placed it all around us. It’s in everything. In anything we can
experience. People just have to change the way they think about those
things. You ought to put a little camper on the back of your pick-up and
go take a look at some of the great work god’s done out here in the
American west.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: Alex…You’re probably right. And I’m going to
take stock of that.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: No, I am.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: I am.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: But I’ll tell you something. The bits and
pieces I’ve put together, you know, what you’ve told me about your
family. Your mother and dad. And I know you got your problems with the
church too, but there’s some kind of bigger thing that we can all
appreciate. And it sounds like you don’t mind calling it God. But when
you forgive, you love. And when you love…God’s light shines on you.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Holy Shit!</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: I told you about that language.</p>
<p><strong>extreme wide shot from below</strong>: The two men on the
summit with the echoing of laughter and Ron’s screams -</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: I told you so! I told you so!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: What are you doing up? It’s three-thirty in
the morning.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: Heard you get up off the couch half an hour
ago, and had a funny feeling you might not be here for our
breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: I’m going to drive you a hundred miles to
somewhere where you can pick up a train, a plane, or hitch a ride
without getting stuck on this desert. I’d take you all the way to Alaska
if I didn’t have to get to an eight o’clock mass.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Ron, you don’t have to do that.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: I want to do it. Get you started on this thing
of yours.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: On my Great -</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: I know. On your “Great Alaskan Adventure.”</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: There’s a machete, an arctic parka, collapsible
fishing pole, and a few odds and ends I threw in there for you.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Ron…</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: Oh, just take it.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: I’ll wait for you in the truck.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: Well my friend.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: I had an idea. You know my mother was an only
child. So was my father. And I was their only child. Now, with my own
boy gone, I’m the end of the line. When I’m gone, my family will be
finished. What do you say, you let me adopt you. I could be, say, your
grandfather.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: How about we talk about this when I get back
from Alaska, Ron. Would that be alright?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Alright, Ron. We’ll talk about it then.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: Yep. We can do that, yep.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Thanks, Ron.</p>
<p><strong>7. series of traveling shots</strong>: Radium Junction, Lake
Louise to Prince George and Dawson STATIC NATURE SHOTS: HELICOPTER
SHOTS</p>
<p><strong>carine</strong>: About a month short of the second
anniversary of Chris’ disappearance, I had gotten engaged to my
boyfriend Jerry Ray and was moving in with him…</p>
<p><strong>carine</strong>: …when I stumbled upon the book Chris had
given me on his graduation day. For some reason, it was the last line of
the poem he read that really stuck out.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: …and I will tell about it.</p>
<p><strong>carine</strong>: I asked Chris who had written the poem.</p>
<p><strong>carine</strong>: Who wrote that?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Well, it could’ve been either one of us.
Couldn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>carine</strong>: What would he tell about now? What did his
voice sound like now?</p>
<p><strong>carine</strong>: I realized that the words to my thoughts
were of less and less meaning. Chris was writing his story and it had to
be Chris who would tell it.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Mom, help me.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: I wasn’t dreaming! I didn’t imagine it! I
heard his voice, Walt. I heard Chris.</p>
<p><strong>214 fairbanks alaska, series of static images: 214</strong>:
Berms of cleared snow line the streets</p>
<p><strong>music over</strong>: Of religious scope. Perhaps choral.</p>
<p><strong>helicopter shot</strong>: We travel a long ways across snowy
peaks and valleys passing between two escarpments of outer range
bordering bottomlands five miles wide until we barely see a tiny form
within it trudging through the snow. We overfly it.</p>
<p><strong>reverse angle</strong>: Chris moving toward the opposite tree
line, he turns back to the gentle river behind. Chris’ POV scanning the
terrain.</p>
<p><strong>crane shot</strong>: We PULL UP from Chris to high above the
clearing.</p>
<p><strong>angle</strong>: Chris: He continues to write as he SPEAKS the
words aloud:</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: …the road. Escaped from Atlanta. Thou shalt
not return `cause the “west is the best.” And now after two rambling
years, comes the final and greatest adventure.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: The climactic battle to kill the false being
within and victoriously conclude the spiritual revolution.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Ten days and nights of freight trains and
hitchhiking, bringing him to the great white north.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: No longer to be poisoned by civilization, he
flees, and walks alone upon the land to become lost in the wild.</p>
<p><strong>cu</strong>: Chris’ hand, he writes and circles the
number:</p>
<p><strong>angle</strong>: Chris, rifle in hand.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>increasingly thin and pale</strong>: hunting, sleeping,
cooking, rice dwindling, line-ups of scrawny shot birds. He adds holes
to his belt leather to accommodate his shrinking waistline.</p>
<p><strong>pov</strong>: the sun, circling high in the heavens. Snowmelt
dripping quickly across the windowpane.</p>
<p><strong>intercut</strong>: SERIES OF ANGLES throughout which Chris
remains thin but his pallor improves:</p>
<p><strong>angle</strong>: CU - He’s beaming with satisfaction.</p>
<p><strong>239 int. bus - later 239</strong>: The diary/log: DAY 31 -
CLIMBED MOUNTAIN</p>
<p><strong>angle</strong>: Chris, reading with great interest. His POV:
The page: what Chris reads: And then, on top of all that, you for a
mate, and children, perhaps - what more can the heart of a man
desire?</p>
<p><strong>angle</strong>: Chris: He looks up from his book. A gentle
breeze tickles morning flowers. The sunlight dances in a coppice of
aspen and leaves of trees above. The sound of buzzing flies mutes. He is
taking one last look at his paradise.</p>
<p><strong>extreme cu</strong>: Beaded and shimmering from the past
night’s rain, a bright red berry moves in the breeze like a tiny
vibrating bell. RACK FOCUS to Chris’ eyes spying it. He plucks it from
its stem.</p>
<p><strong>angle</strong>: The book</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Here she stopped and, closing her eyes, took
a deep breath of the flower-scented air of the broad expanse around her.
It was dearer to her than her kin, better than a lover, wiser than a
book.</p>
<p><strong>angle</strong>: Chris pulls more berries from the bag and
chews on them as he reads.</p>
<p><strong>angle</strong>: The book</p>
<p>****: For a moment, she re-discovered the purpose of her life. She
was here in earth to grasp the meaning of its wild enchantment and call
each thing by its right name.</p>
<p><strong>angle</strong>: Chris</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: By its right name. By its right name.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Beautiful blueberries - Vaccinium uliginosum.
Eskimo potato - Hedysarum alpinum…etc.</p>
<p><strong>angle</strong>: The diary/log: EXTREMELY WEAK. FAULT OF
POTATO</p>
<p><strong>wide angle tableau</strong>: Chris standing at the river’s
edge catching his breath framed against the background of the 3000 foot
butte that he’d so recently climbed with ease.</p>
<p><strong>angle</strong>: The bear, just as passive towards Chris, as
though he didn’t represent enough of anything to eat.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Set small signal fire today - watched it die
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>267 int. bus - day 267</strong>: The diary/log: DAY 100 -
MADE IT. BUT IN WEAKEST</p>
<p><strong>angle</strong>: The page: what he reads:</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: And that an unshared happiness is not
happiness…</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Call everything by its right name.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: What if you saw me running into your
arms…</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Would you see then…</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: …what I see now?</p>
