<p><strong>gareth</strong>: I suppose we could just sack him.</p>
<p><strong>gareth</strong>: Look, I don’t hate the man but …</p>
<p><strong>lord walton</strong>: I know, Gareth. It’s the mental strain
he inflicts on us all. How is Professor Bradbury</p>
<p><strong>lord walton</strong>: Mmmm, and how far are we with the
computer, Hubert?</p>
<p><strong>hubert</strong>: Timothy is loading the final catalogue data
as we speak, Milord. An awful thing to say, but when the program’s up
and running our, Mr. Bean will become a little less than …. useful?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Morning, Bean.</p>
<p><strong>gareth</strong>: Maybe it would be simpler to pack all our
paintings onto trucks and move the entire National Gallery somewhere
else. And not tell him.</p>
<p><strong>hubert</strong>: Seconded. We could all move to France.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: All those in favour.</p>
<p><strong>lord walton</strong>: Come on - settle down everyone.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I’m sorry I’m late.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Steady on, old man. I only …</p>
<p><strong>gareth</strong>: Not you, you idiot.</p>
<p><strong>suit man</strong>: Ah Bean, I’m looking for a painting by Van
Hocht. Still Life. Circa 1670. Can do?</p>
<p><strong>suit man</strong>: What would we do without you! The entire
inventory of British Art stored in that one, curious brain of yours.</p>
<p><strong>gareth</strong>: Then we are agreed, gentlemen. He goes.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Only if we’re positive that the new
catalogue database will render Mr. Bean’s hitherto ‘talents’
obsolete.</p>
<p><strong>hubert</strong>: There’s no question.</p>
<p><strong>lord walton</strong>: Very well. Mr Bean is…. art history. We
can all stop taking the pills.</p>
<p><strong>lord walton</strong>: Miss Hutchinson, would you send
Mr. Bean up to the boardroom, please.</p>
<p><strong>lord walton</strong>: Thank you. One final thing. Once again
we have been invited by the Grierson Gallery of Southern California to
second one of our staff for a short visit. The Grierson has a fairly
modest collection - but it does include the most famous American
painting of all, ‘Whistler’s Mother’. Any thoughts?</p>
<p><strong>lord walton</strong>: Yes. Sir Rupert. And may I say sir, how
honoured we are that you still grace us with all your time, wisdom, and
infinite knowledge. Your invaluable thoughts, sir?</p>
<p><strong>sir rupert</strong>: Could you speak up please. I didn’t
catch the question.</p>
<p><strong>suit man</strong>: Thank you, Bean. You’re a genius.</p>
<p><strong>miss hutchinson</strong>: Mr. Bean. Lord Walton would like to
see you in the boardroom.</p>
<p><strong>programmer</strong>: What’s happening here?</p>
<p><strong>bean</strong>: Ahm…</p>
<p><strong>bean</strong>: Ah…. Ahm….</p>
<p><strong>lord walton</strong>: You have your voting slips, gentlemen.
Please remember the</p>
<p><strong>lord walton</strong>: Ah, Mr. Bean. Please take a seat for a
moment. I have some news which will not, I’m afraid…</p>
<p><strong>lord walton</strong>: Yes? Put him on… Timothy. The computer
… Yes… When? How? All of it? Absolutely all of it? Did you back it up?
How long will it … ? Another six months. Fair enough. Come up here will
you, dear boy.</p>
<p><strong>lord walton</strong>: As I was saying, gentlemen. The
Grierson Gallery. South California. Great opportunity. Thousands-of
miles-away though it is. Doctorate or no doctorate, perhaps</p>
<p><strong>lord walton</strong>: Mr. Bean. Wonderful news. You are going
to America.</p>
<p><strong>mr. bean</strong>: Ooooh, how lovely.</p>
<p><strong>lord walton</strong>: Ah, Timothy. You’re sacked.</p>
<p><strong>grierson</strong>: Lord Walton assures me this guy’s one of
the very top scholars in the English art world. Has a couple of
doctorates no less.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Great news.</p>
<p><strong>check-in lady</strong>: Here we go, sir. You’ve been moved to
l st. class. Apparently your friends at the Gallery were so delighted
that you’re finally on your way.</p>
<p><strong>grierson</strong>: So … I’m wondering if one of you would
have this guy stay in your home instead of some expensive hotel.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Love to, sir, but no can do. No spare room.
Period.</p>
<p><strong>grierson</strong>: David?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Oh, look, I mean, it’s kind of the last
thing… I mean, I’d really like to, but… things at home are kind of
sensitive, so I couldn’t really er …</p>
<p><strong>grierson</strong>: I thought perhaps as Vice-President, and
in view of the unfortunate attendance’s for the summer show this year…
the MASSIVE financial</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: on the other hand … maybe a breath of fresh
air is just what my family needs … Yes. Great news. Fabulous.
Triumphant. Course it might need a little smoothing over. When’s he
due?</p>
<p><strong>grierson</strong>: Tomorrow. You have a problem with
that?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: No. Perfect. Looking forward to it.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Hi, Jennifer. How was school? oh really?
That’s good, great. Fantastic. We’ll talk some more.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Hello, David.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Hi, Charles. Wow - late!</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: I had to do some last minute stuff.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: My fault. We’ve got a heavy load on at
present. How about you, gallery going well?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Ahm, well, you know ~ that’s a tough question
- on one’ level I think it ….</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: Don’t ask him about work, Charlie. Life’s
too short.</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: Kevin! You stop that right now!</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Great kids. Good looking too.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You think so? Well I ’spose they’re pretty,
you know… okay, looks-wise.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Ah … absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: Let’s take a break, David. This weekend, why
don’t we just get into the car and drive to the coast. Find a motel.
Like before the kids were born. Go to a fairground. Win me another
Bambi.</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: Jennifer can stay and look after Kevin</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Sounds great. Excellent. Though-, Ahm…
there’s this guy who’s coming to work at the Gallery, from England…</p>
<p>****: Yeeees?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: And they asked me if we’d like to … you know…
put him up for a while.</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: There aren’t hotels?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Yes, there are hotels. They just thought
maybe it’d be nice for him to stay with a real American family. Popcorn,
waffles, all that stuff.</p>
<p>****: And what did you say?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I said I’d check with you.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Then I said ‘yes’.</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: Do we know anything about him?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Ahm - he’s male. He’s English. He’s a doctor
of er … at least 2 things. I think they would have mentioned if he was a
blind dwarf. Or one of those guys who kills lots of people all the time.
I think we’re looking at someone moderately normal here.</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: David - are you ever going to learn to say
‘no’?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Yes. Yes. Sometime.</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: It’s the last thing we need.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: That’s exactly what I said … before I said -
Great, it’s a sensational idea.”</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Hiya Dad ~ I’ll need you upstairs for
homework in about …. oh, 20 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Great, good.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Didn’t kids do their own homework, like way
back? Years ago? No. Course not. Just imagining it.</p>
<p><strong>old lady</strong>: Be careful. It’s for my
Grand-daughter.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Oh come on - the guy’s going to be a
creep. All Englishmen are ugly.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What makes you say that?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: All the guys they claim are English to and
good-looking like Dan Day-Lewis and Liam Neeson, turn out to be Irish.
Even Anthony Hopkins is welsh. Prince Charles is so ugly they pay him
two million bucks a year to stay indoors.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Richard Burton was very good-looking.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Welsh.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Sean Connery.</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: Scottish.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Tom Jones?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Welsh again.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Okay, so the guy’s gonna look like Meatloaf’s
backside. No-one’s asking you to go to bed with him.</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: Bed sounds good though. Bed sounds
great.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Who do you think is the ugliest guy who ever
lived.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Well, Michael Bolton’s pretty grisly.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I vote for Bart.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Shut up, Kevin.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: NO, seriously - I know he’s your boyfriend,
but there’s something about his upper lip that is so weird. What do you
think it is, Dad? Jen says it’s a moustache, I say it’s a cluster of
about 11 mosquitoes, resting.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: You know the thing I hate most about
children?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: You.</p>
<p><strong>cop 1</strong>: Police! Stop or we shoot!</p>
<p><strong>cop 1</strong>: Carefully take out your weapon, holding the
butt with two fingers only. Slowly place it on the floor and take three
paces back!</p>
<p><strong>brutus</strong>: Mr. Bean. Are you presently on any kind of
medication at all?</p>
<p><strong>brutus</strong>: You could certainly use some.</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: What did they say?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Well, they’re kind of busy but it doesn’t
look like …</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: Did you really ask?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’m not sure I got the right person but they
were a bit busy …</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: What’s wrong with you, David? All you have
to do is say, Excuse me, I’ve been sitting here since the start of the
Millennium and I’d really like some action from you before the end of
the world. I’ll go.</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: I said, I’11 go.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: So. where do your parents live?</p>
<p><strong>stingo</strong>: My parents are dead.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Yeah, so are mine.</p>
<p><strong>cop 1</strong>: Just get him the hell out of here, will
ya?</p>
<p><strong>cab driver</strong>: Thanks man, I can’t tell you how much I
appreciate talking to ya. In this job you get so many jerks spilling
their guts all over ya, with their stupid problems … But you, you’re a
great listener, ya know that?</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: It isn’t working any more, David.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I know - I’11 take it in to George tomorrow’-
he’ll fix it. Stupid thing.</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: No, US. It’s not working any longer -you and
me.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: I need some time, David. A little time. It’s
not just you. It’s partly me.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Thanks a lot, Kevin!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: That poor guy, Bean … He’s probably still
sitting at London Airport!</p>
<p><strong>int. the leary house. d &amp; a’s bedroom - night</strong>:
ALISON is still watching T.V. The volume is getting to DAVID.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Alison, please.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I need to make a confession. I know you’re
awake. Please, it’s important.</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I had the last strawberry in the
refrigerator.</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: There were three strawberries.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: One.</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: Liar.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: 0h Ali we can work this thing out, you
know.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Ali? What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: Your face smells like a foot.</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: What is it? Jennifer!</p>
<p>****: … There’s a man … there’s a man … there’s a man in my…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Honey, calm down now… it’s okay…</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: There’s a man. I woke up next to a man
…</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: Shut up, Kevin. Honey, you-re not making
sense …</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It’s okay. There’s no one out here. Just open
the door. Trust me.</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: He can’t stay here, David.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Okay. It’s not a problem… Let’s just sit …
I’11 talk to the gallery …</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: David, I’m serious!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I know you are. Very serious … most of the
time these days.</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: Now what does that mean? My daughter wakes
up with a strange man in her bed, and I’m supposed to think it’s
amusing? That tie’s God-awful. Why do you wear it?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Ah, Mr Bean …</p>
<p><strong>bean</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: the T.V. comes on at the start of a
documentary about grizzly bears.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: close on TEDDY sitting in his cardboard box
hotel. Flickering light</p>
<p><strong>bean</strong>: Now - can I help?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Two dollars please.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Annie, it’s me.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, right, yeah. two dollars please.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: No, Annie, no. This is Doctor Bean. He’s
going to be working with us.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, great. Usually we charge people two
dollars to come in- but for people who work here, that would be 730
dollars a year, which is like, a lot of money, so we kinda like let them
off. Hi.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: He doesn’t like to say much does he?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Right first time.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I can understand THAT. Neither do I.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You’ll notice, our clientele is not totally
young. I sometimes worry they’re not really getting to grips with the
art on a deep aesthetic level.</p>
<p><strong>old lady 1</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>old lady 2</strong>: 0h yes - lovely - very nice.</p>
<p><strong>old lady 1</strong>: And what colour would you use for the
curtains?</p>
<p><strong>old lady 2</strong>: Well, I thought the sort of blue in this
one. And I thought the curtains in the bathroom would be nice in this
yellow ….</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Beautiful. ‘HIS MISTRESS’ by John Everett
Millais, 1829 to 96. Know it?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Excuse me. Mr Grierson called down. He’s
ready to see you upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Thanks, Annie.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Better go. Grierson hates people being
late.</p>
<p><strong>bean</strong>: Yes. Ahm… think I’11 …</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Why me?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Come on! Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>grierson</strong>: Ah, David. Finally. And this must be our
professor from across the sea.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Yes, this is Doctor Bean.</p>
<p><strong>bean</strong>: Actually I’m not …. er …</p>
<p><strong>grierson</strong>: This is Bernard Schimmel. Bernie the
Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>thomas grierson</strong>: Ah ~ the Tribune - mind if I just
….</p>
<p><strong>grierson</strong>: Take a seat, gentlemen….. although before
we settle - feast your eyes on these.</p>
<p><strong>grierson</strong>: Arthur Rackham. Originals of course. Got
four of them. Check this out … Venus and the Cat, Aesop’s Fables. Isn’t
that something?</p>
<p><strong>david.</strong>: They’re beautiful, sir.</p>
<p><strong>grierson</strong>: Maybe. Hell of a price, I’11 tell you.
Anyway - down to business.</p>
<p><strong>grierson</strong>: Bernie was just showing me his new ideas
for a cross-gallery computer system. Dr Bean - would you like to look at
this? Very exciting stuff ….</p>
<p><strong>bean</strong>: Ahm … NO.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: What I’m doing, Dave, is developing the
ultimate user-friendly,’ interactive public guide to the gallery.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It’s very good Bernie.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: But the particular glory of the system… is
that it can also work oh large screens in each individual room - so we
can network the program to every room in the gallery.</p>
<p><strong>grierson</strong>: Not bad, eh? What do you think, Doctor?
Ah…. Doctor Bean?</p>
<p><strong>grierson</strong>: Well, thanks for dropping by. Enjoy your
stay with our Vice President and his family. They’re simple people.-.but
warm, yes, Doctor?</p>
<p><strong>bean</strong>: I’m not actually… um…</p>
<p><strong>grierson</strong>: … Settled in yet. I know. Plenty of time.
Bernie, perhaps you’d like to take Dr. Bean on a tour of the
gallery.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Absolutely. This way, sir.</p>
<p><strong>grierson</strong>: He’s a genius, right?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Ah… He certainly has something, sir.</p>
<p><strong>grierson</strong>: Very pleased you’ve taken him in, David.
At a time when no-one’s job is safe, it really identifies you as a team
player.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Yes, although, I really….. thank you. Yes,
it’s great to have him with us. The whole family’s very excited.</p>
<p><strong>grierson</strong>: Glad to hear it. Tell poor Mr Larson to
come through, will you?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You’re not going to ….</p>
<p><strong>grierson</strong>: Sack him? David, what else can I do? This
business is not, repeat, not breaking even. And David … notice anything
this morning?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You’ve tinted your hair? It takes years off
you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Goodnight Annie.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Night.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: DAVID watching bemusedly some way off.</p>
<p><strong>robber</strong>: Gimme the keys!</p>
<p><strong>robber</strong>: I said, give me the keys!</p>
<p><strong>bean</strong>: 1,2,3,4, 5, 6,7,8, 9,10</p>
<p><strong>robber</strong>: But I haven’t got a f…..</p>
<p><strong>bean</strong>: Ssssh!!!!</p>
<p><strong>robber</strong>: I haven’t got a gun.</p>
<p><strong>robber</strong>: Okay, okay, I’11 do it!</p>
<p><strong>cop 1</strong>: Excuse me. Mr. er … Cabbage?</p>
<p><strong>brutus</strong>: It’s Eddie Guardino. Go pick him up.</p>
<p><strong>brutus</strong>: Guardino fled the scene with 160 K, in a
white plastic bag. We got the car. We got the bag. And we got 20 pairs
of stinking pantyhose. Anything you wanna tell me?</p>
<p><strong>brutus</strong>: ’Fraid I’m gonna have to keep this.</p>
<p><strong>brutus</strong>: Mr. Bean. You lookin’ to stay long in
California?</p>
<p><strong>mr. bean</strong>: Oh, yes.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: He was incredible. This guy is fearless. He
has no fear.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: That’s one - way of looking at it. You might
also say this guy is brainless he has no brain’.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Well, there is that …</p>
<p>****: I’11 give you a chance… Know anything about computers?</p>
<p><strong>bean</strong>: Ahm….</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: It’s so embarrassing. All the guys I know are
on Goblins 3 and I’m still stuck with the lousy Wizard in Goblins 2.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Come on, winkle.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: It’s gotta be here. Something to get the key
away from the stupid cuckoo.</p>
<p><strong>bean</strong>: Click, click, click, click, click …</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: How’d you do that!? That was so
obvious!!!</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Beanie, you are waaaaay Cool!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Hi,</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: Hi….. Roses.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Yes. And I have a wine for dinner that will
kill you.</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: Great. You said you’d ask Grierson about
putting our guest somewhere else. Did you?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Sort of half…..</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: Meaning?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I was sort of half way through the sentence
in which I would have asked him when it suddenly seemed like a
mistake.</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: Honestly David, you’re so spineless.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Roses. Wine.</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: But no real change.</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: I really do need some time on my own. Away
from here.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Look, Bean’s history. I swear to you, he’s
packing as we speak. And you can’t leave. I’ve got Bambi. You never go
anywhere without him. Please let’s just talk.</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: Okay. Put Bambi down, and we’ll talk.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Look, you guys, could you just give us a
moment to … Jennifer - could you turn that damn thing down.</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: No, that’s not for the TV. That’s for the
…</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I wish I could use that at school. “Hey,
Teach, no hard feelings … It’s just things between us ain’t what they
used to be and I need a little space, ya know? So I’11 see you around in
a couple of years, maybe”.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: It’s a kind of an interesting swap. Mom
for the Man from Ga Ga.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Jen - you don’t wanna talk about it?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: It’s you and Mom that need to talk.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Sure. You’re right.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: You know, Mr. Bean’s okay. You’re not gonna
kick him out, are you, Dad?</p>
<p>****: Of course he is.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Are you?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Yes, I am. I must.</p>
<p><strong>bean</strong>: Enter.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Hi, am I disturbing you?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: May I?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: None of your folks here - Family?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Look… the reason I came in here was to …
well… since you’ve been here twelve all…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Well, that’s er…great. Look, I just came in …
… to say good night. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Spineless.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Bean can I ask you something?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Do you think you can ever really know
someone? Even if you’ve known them, well, almost all your life? What do
you think?</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: the T.V. plug in its socket. This end of the
string is tied to it. The string tightens and the plug is yanked out of
the socket. The T.V. screen goes blank. Shot of TEDDY in the cardboard
hotel’.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I think the time has come from you to meet
the grand Madame. She’s all around you … how do you fancy meeting her in
the flesh?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I usually only let her out for the big summer
exhibition - but’ let’s see whether what they say about the healing
power of great works of art is true, huh?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: As you can see, security’s pretty tight in
this section. Nobody gets past Elmer here. Isn’t that right?</p>
<p><strong>elmer</strong>: Not in one piece anyway. I see Mrs Whistler
as kind of … like my own dear mother. I’d kill any man that tried to
interfere with her. The Vice President here will vouch for that.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You’ve known me five years Elmer. When do you
get to calling me David?</p>
<p><strong>elmer</strong>: Not my place, sir. It would only be a matter
of time before I’m calling you Dave. Then where would we be? By next
year, you’re my Sweety-Pie” and I’m “Coochie-Coo”. I’11 be back in
15.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You think he’s tough you should see the size
of the hunk that works the night shift.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Stay there. Keep your eyes closed. One final
lock, one final key.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Right. Open now.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’11 leave you with her for a few minutes.
I’m sure you’ll want to give her a proper inspection. But whatever you
do, don’t leave the room. Megasecurity, okay? Catch you.</p>
<p><strong>bean</strong>: What the … !!!</p>
<p><strong>elevator voice</strong>: Second floor.</p>
<p><strong>thin woman</strong>: I guess I’ll see you up there, guys.</p>
<p><strong>elevator voice</strong>: Third floor.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: I was hoping DU. Bean might take a look at
my computer project today.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Yes. I’11 mention it to him. But … he’s kind
of his own guy, you know?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Howls he getting on with the family?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Ah. Fine. It’s good. It’s great.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: And howls Alison?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: She’s … well, she’s good.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Saw her at the movies the other night with
that boss of hers. Nice guy. Good looking.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Yes, isn’t he.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: I like to think that’s what’s happened with
you and me … even though you’re kinda my boss. Still maybe it won’t
always be that way, huh?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Look, I’ve left Bean on his own. Nice to chat
though Bernie - always a subtle joy.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Thanks, David. Always a pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: By the way. Don’t know what you think, Mr
Vice President, but I’ve been hinting to the old man that someone’s got
to have the balls to take some sort of emergency measures around here -
or we’re all in the crap house. What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: ’Emergency measures, in your book means sack
people right?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Not necessarily. That’s where this … comes
in. No, I’ve had a better idea than sacking people. You’ll hear soon
enough.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: True love can be very hard.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Seems to be a problem with the door. Where’s
the picture gone?</p>
<p><strong>bean</strong>: Ahm…..</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What? What?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Oh Jesus. Oh God. Oh Jesus God. Oh Mary
Mother of Jesus. Oh Jesus of Nazareth.</p>
<p><strong>bean</strong>: oh dear.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What happened?!!!</p>
<p><strong>bean</strong>: Ahm…. .</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Don’t bother Oh my god…..</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Brilliant. Brilliant. Problem solved!</p>
<p><strong>grierson</strong>: Ah, David. Showing Dr. Bean our good
lady?</p>
<p><strong>bean</strong>: Actually I’m not a…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: That’s right - Whistler’s Mother. Looking at
his mother - not his father - not interested in his father, Couldn’t
give a flying doughnut for his sisters or brothers - just his mother.
Yes.</p>
<p><strong>grierson</strong>: Well, good - think I may go and look at
her myself…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>grierson</strong>: Er … pray tell me why?</p>
<p><strong>elmer</strong>: Because they’ve just cut her into tiny
pieces, sir. That’s why.</p>
<p><strong>elmer</strong>: I better continue my rounds, sir..</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: The thing is, sir, I’ve just been giving the
painting a very thorough inspection, with the help of Dr Bean here - and
we feel the time’s come for Whistler’s Mum to have her first
face-lift.</p>
<p><strong>grierson</strong>: Time taken its toll on the old girl,
eh?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Exactly. She’s in a surprisingly terrible
state. Isn’t she, Bean?</p>
<p><strong>bean</strong>: Oh yes.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Whistler was a great painter, but he wasn’t a
great chooser of paints ….</p>
<p><strong>grierson</strong>: Thank you David. However, flattery will
get you nowhere. Truth</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: … you have to sack me. I understand, sir.
I’ll go quietly. In fact I’ll go right now.</p>
<p><strong>grierson</strong>: No. no, no, hold on … We cant sustain our
loses - so I’ve decided.. to sell Whistler’s Mother.</p>
<p><strong>grierson</strong>: Brilliant, huh? I already have a
prospective buyer - the current Governor of California, no less, who is
flies in tomorrow to inspect her and clinch the deal. Spread the news. I
think decisive leadership has done the trick, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Congratulations.
Marvellous thing. Bravo.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Bean. Do you drink?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Neither do I.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It’s just a matter of acceptance, isn’t it …
lose your job - lose you wife … C’est la vie. You ever been married,
Bean?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I guess not.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: He’s English, okay? You wanna make something
of it?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: … To hell with the figures. I’m not a damn
accountant. I’m an artist. You know, me and Ali met in art school? I cut
quite a figure then. Far cry from the man you see before you now. Then,
I smoked Gitanes before I went to bed, to help me sort out the problems
of the world. Now, I take a spoonful of laxative before I go to bed to
help me sort out the problem with my bowels.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Truth is, I disappointed her. I turned out to
have no spine. Spineless. A kind of medical miracle. Mr Flippy-Floppy. I
just don’t seem to be able to fight - cant stick up for myself. Too
nice. I mean, I should never have let you come stay and I should be
handing you over to the police right now. Shall I tell you something,
Beanie …</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Do you want to know what the reality of the
situation is?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: So, you’ve totally and utterly destroyed my
life. Do you understand? You’ve put me in a position where it would have
been better if I’d never been born.</p>

He has to sprint back, grab all the keys, and charge back again to the
door. Then he has to try out every single key. We never see him find the
right one.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: 0 my God. Tell it vas a dream.</p>
<p><strong>bean</strong>: Morning.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It wasn’t a dream, was it. I have to go in to
work and tell them Whistler’s Mother now looks like Danny De Vito.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>grierson</strong>: I think you’re wrong, David. She looks as
fine as she’s ever looked. Worth every cent of the 10 million
dollar-s.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Ahm….</p>
<p><strong>grierson</strong>: Bravo. Let’s put on a good show tomorrow,
shall we? Don’t want anything to go wrong.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Quite right, sir.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Wait a minute.</p>
<p><strong>bean</strong>: Ssshhhh.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Bye, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Ah … Jennifer, I need you to watch Kevin.
Jen?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Be serious, Dad. It’s Saturday.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Jen, you have to help me here! I’ve got to go
in to work, and with your mom away … I really need you.</p>
<p><strong>stingo</strong>: You.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Don’t worry, Dad. I’ll be home. Monday,
after school.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Hey, En, nice bike’- but remember: any kids
you have are gonna look just like its handsome driver.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Jennifer! This is not - repeat, not! how we
do things in this family. I’ve told you never to get on one of those
death traps! Please - talk to me. I promise to be reasonable.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Great, Dad. You promised you’d get rid of
him! And as for: “how we do things in this family. We don’t have a
family till you get Mom back.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Come on Sting!</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Sting?! Sounds like something you put on a
rash.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Don’t just stand there, Bean - do
something.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Right! Right! You get inside and look after
Kevin! Uh — Right! Kevin. You get inside and look after … uh… Right! Get
in the car! Both of you. Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: So, Kevin. How’s it going?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Badly. You wanna adopt me?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Big day today, huh?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Uh … yes …</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Great day. At last we can start getting out
of debt and concentrating on the future.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Yes, look, I wanted to talk to you about
this. I’m sure we haven’t been doing as badly as all that.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Annie … would you look after Kevin? And Kevin
- you look after Bean.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: My Dad told me all about you.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Did he now?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: He says you’ve got a babe count of ten out of
ten, and a brain cell count of about two and a half.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah, I’ll go with that. I’m kinda, like,
dumb, intellectually. But I’m great in bed.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Catch you later, babe. Come on, Beanie -
there must be a computer here somewhere. I hate paintings. They don’t do
anything.</p>
<p><strong>grierson</strong>: Well, congratulations. Isn’t that great,
David?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Certainly is.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: We’ll be able to start this afternoon. I’11
pipe the guide to every video screen in the gallery. Now, that’ll
impress the Governor.</p>
<p><strong>grierson</strong>: Well, bravo! What with you and Whistler’s
Ma - I think I’ve got a winning team.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: This is way cool, Beanie.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Jesus! Hurry up you guys. Am I the only
person round here who actually gets things done.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You arrange those flowers yourself?</p>
<p><strong>elmer</strong>: Sure did.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: They’re pretty. Learn it in the army?</p>
<p><strong>elmer</strong>: No - but when you’ve torn out a man’s throat
with your bare hands, you learn to appreciate the beautiful things in
life.</p>
<p><strong>grierson</strong>: What a pleasure, Governor Reynolds. I’d
like you to meet some of our staff here. .</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: And that’s where you introduce me to the
Governor.</p>
<p><strong>grierson</strong>: Right. Got it.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Good day, Governor Reynolds. I’m Annie …</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Curtsy.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Curtsy? Are you kidding? This is 1990s
America. Women don’t curtsy, they run the damn country!</p>
<p><strong>grierson</strong>: Alex, please!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: That’s Annie, sir.</p>
<p><strong>grierson</strong>: This is Elmer, our longest serving…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Hey. Let’s junk the medals, Elmer. This is
not a Veterans’ reunion. We wanna make the Governor feel at home. Not
remind him of piles of dead people wearing uniforms.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: David Leary. I’d like to echo my colleagues
welcome to you and thank you for your patronage …</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Okay, that’ll do. The Governor’s here in
half an hour. We have to be totally ready then. No excuses. Period!</p>
<p><strong>grierson</strong>: Thank you Bernie. Well done. Now, If
you’ll excuse - I have a little smartening up to do myself.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I’m just gonna go see if Annie needs me for
anything. Truth is, she smells kinda nice. okay? .</p>
<p><strong>g-o-b-l-i-n</strong>: A message pops up: “ACCESS DENIED” BEAN
tries something 0 else.</p>
<p><strong>g-n-o-m-e-s</strong>: The message again: `ACCESS DENIED’. The
room door suddenly opens! Making BEAN jump! It’s BERNIE. He cannot see
the computer screen from the doorway.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: How goes it, Bean? Ready for the
Governor?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: We need you downstairs in ten minutes and
not a second more. Period. Oh, And put this on.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: David? Lift off!</p>
<p><strong>grierson</strong>: what a pleasure, Governor. Welcome.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Hi, Grierson, forgive the war paint. Going
on To my regiment/s reunion after.</p>
<p><strong>grierson</strong>: Not at all, Governor. Very striking.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Interesting suit.</p>
<p><strong>grierson</strong>: Why thank you sir.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: off the peg?</p>
<p><strong>grierson</strong>: Yes it is … may I introduce you To Bern
…</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Go park the old jalopy, will ya, son.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Bean - go park the Governor’s car, will
you.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Good day, Governor. I’m Annie. You know,
you’re a lot taller than you were half an hour ago.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Well, that’s great to hear at my age,
Annie. Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Governor Reynolds, does your wife, like, have
to curtsy? Or does she 0 have a decent job?</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Er … Mrs. Reynolds is doing just fine.
Just fine.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Nice set of medals there Elmer. Which
beach they drop you on? Utah? Omaha?</p>
<p><strong>elmer</strong>: Couldn’t tell you sir. I was so drugged up
with the killing I didn’t know where I was.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Well, congratulations soldier.</p>
<p><strong>grierson</strong>: Ah, one of my favourites. It expresses a
universal agony that the established Church so rarely acknowledges,
don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Jesus … no one’s got feet like for crying
out loud. Have you got feet like that? Dammed if I have. Let’s move it,
shall we?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Everything okay, David?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Yes. Ahm. I was just wondering where my
English house guest had got to.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: He’s just parking the Governor’s car.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Great - keep him out of trouble.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Can we go and see Mrs. Whistler now? My
eyes are making my feet sore, as my wife would say.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Sure, Governor. Please. This way.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen - most of you have seen
Whistler’s Mother before, can I ask you just to step back. Thank
you.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’d like the Governor to have, as it were, a
private audience with his new friend.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Well, hello Ma’am! Yes - she certainly
looks a million dollars to me - or should I say ten million dollars!</p>
<p><strong>grierson</strong>: Bravo - what do you say to a final glass
of, though I say it</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Governor, I don’t believe you’ve met Dr Bean,
our expert from England.</p>
<p><strong>bean</strong>: Ah, hello, sorry, I … Ahm… sorry …</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: the looks of horror on all the faces.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: BEAN, reaching out to keep himself standing.
We think he’s going to tear the painting. He doesn’t. He simply catches
hold of the bottom of the ornate frame. It ,,snaps off.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: a look of relief for an instant on all
faces.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: the truth - as the frame breaks off, there
is the little white strip, saying, THE GRIERSON GALLERY, HOME OF
WHISTLER’S MOTHER”-</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: a look of horror on all faces.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: ELMER looking like someone has just murdered
his own mother.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: BRUTUS and SIDE-KICK glowering at BEAN.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: You were going to sell the State of
California a poster - for ten million dollars! Who the hell do you think
you are, Shorty!?</p>
<p><strong>grierson</strong>: Look, Governor - just wait - it’s may not
be as bad as it looks ….</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Nice try, kiddo.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: David. There’s a call for you. It’s your
wife.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Great. Classic timing. Why don’t you ask her
just to leave a date for the divorce? I’ll check my diary later.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: She’s calling from the hospital …</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: She’s on line three!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Such… great buns.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: I’ve known soldiers who’ve had their heads
blown off who were more intelligent than you two. Not only have you
failed to protect your most valuable possession from theft - but you
didn’t even know it’d been stolen! I’d sooner buy heroin from the guy
who sells drugs outside my grandson’s school than anything from you
guys.</p>
<p><strong>grierson</strong>: I am sorry you feel that way.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: And I’m sorry you look that way,
short-ass. That suit stinks and you obviously dye your hair.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Certainly, sir.</p>
<p><strong>brutus</strong>: Come on man! Move it!</p>
<p><strong>elmer</strong>: Hey, Cop, wanna ride? Jeese, where do they
get you guys?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: There is one other tiny problem, sir.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Is Jenny gonna be okay?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: She was wearing a helmet. It could have been
worse.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: But is she gonna be okay?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Damn! She’s a good kid. Sometimes good people
get a break once in a while.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: ELMER’s CAR is in the traffic queue about
ten cars back. BRUTUS and SIDE-KICK get out and start running down the
line towards DAVID’s car.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: BRUTUS and SIDE-KICK turn on their heels and
head back to ELMER’s car. They are very unfit.</p>
<p><strong>elmer</strong>: It’s okay! I’ll tail ’em!</p>
<p><strong>brutus</strong>: You got it.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Just stay away from me! D’you hear?</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Don’t even think of saying one word to me,
or I’11 find a way of fitting all three of those cars right up your
ass.</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: They’re not calling it a coma. The doctor
says she’s … just kind of taking time out. Hi, tough guy. It’s a busy
night. The doctor will be back in a while.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>doctor 1</strong>: I’ll be back in a minute.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Okay, great.</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: At least you didn’t bring Mr Bean with
you.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Ah, well ….</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Doctor Jacobson?</p>
<p><strong>doctor jacobson</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: We need you urgently in C Theatre.</p>
<p><strong>doctor jacobson</strong>: Damn. I was just going to Number 4
….</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: It is urgent, sir.</p>
<p><strong>doctor jacobson</strong>: Okay…..</p>
<p><strong>elmer</strong>: No, no, I didn’t realise the situation. I
won’t disturb them now.</p>
<p><strong>elmer</strong>: Buck?</p>
<p><strong>nurse 2</strong>: Doctor … Bean?</p>
<p><strong>bean</strong>: Actually … … Yes, yes, yes…</p>
<p><strong>nurse 2</strong>: Just in time, sir. Allow me.</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: When the Police told me what had happened I
… it’s stupid I know … but I remembered all that stuff people do to get
through to coma victims …</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Like playing them recordings of their dish
washers and coffee grinders?</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: That right. So I went home and picked it
up.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Good thinking. You still call it ‘home’.</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: Good evening Doctor.. What we have here
is a bullet wound in the lower thorax it seems to have ruptured the
lung, and there’s severe inner bleeding along the abdomen.</p>
<p><strong>nurse 2</strong>: He’s coming round.</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: Give him a T 70, straight away.</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: Shall I do the cut, sir?</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: I’m sorry. it’s only MY first week.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: I’m afraid we’ll now have to wait for the
X-rays, Doctor, or we’ll never find the bullet. Come on everyone sort
out the support systems.</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: Here we go, doctor. the bullet is here -
so we’ll probably have to extend the cut to here. Think we all better be
prepared for a long one here. This is tricky.</p>
<p><strong>side-kick</strong>: Any news on the chief?.</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: There certainly is. Dr Bean here just
saved his life.</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: 0 my god.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Sorry, honey - he just happened to tag
along.</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: Nothing ever really changes, does it,
David?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>doctor 2</strong>: Yes, your doctor will be with you in a
minute. We have a lot to deal with here, sir.</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: Excuse me, doctor.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Really Ma’am, we’ll get to you in due
course.</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Say that again, son.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: I beg your pardon?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I said say that again, son - because the next
time you do, I’ll make sure you’re in there with my daughter, but in a
slightly less healthy state and she’s in a coma with a broken arm right
now.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: I’m er … sorry if you’ve been waiting a long
time.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: We have. In fact, we’ve been sitting here
since the start of the Millennium and I’d really like some action from
you before the end of the world.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: So, why not haul your … nice little ass into
this room and explain to me and my wife why our precious daughter is
going to be absolutely fine because of all the fantastic intelligence
and attention you are going to give her case.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Okay, sir. Certainly. Good.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Yes, and Bean, for God’s sake, keep out of
the goddamn way, will you?</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: Smiling Well, well.</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: Let’s get a coffee.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Yes. Great. Kevin, I’11 send Bean in to keep
you company.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Help me with this. It’s a scientific
experiment. We’re gonna wake up Sleeping Beauty here with the tortured
screams of Vampire bats.</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: Disgusting.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Everything’s gonna be fine.</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: About Charles…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: shhh…</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: It was nothing. We’re not … He just makes me
laugh. When was the last time we laughed? Any of us?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I know… I know. I’ve been an arsehole of
spectacular proportions. Olympic standard.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Dad…</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: These guys just hijacked the T.V. Me and Bean
were trying to …</p>
<p><strong>hospital porter</strong>: Sorry, folks. We’re short on these
and there’s another kid down the hall that could use …</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Wait a minute ….</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: Please. It’s okay. Really. Wow - who put the
fire in you, my’ man?</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: Maybe I ought to think about getting another
job.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Good idea - with a boss who’s a really ugly
son-of-a-bitch.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I thought you said….</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Now, Bean … just put down that thing … nice
and slow … you hear me? Come on now…</p>
<p><strong>to</strong>: a close-up of the monitor. The he-man chases the
pulse light …</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Dad! Get off!? What’s happening here?!
Mom?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I don’t care what anyone says. Mr. Bean
brought my sister back from the dead. He did it under laboratory
conditions. My eyes do not lie!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Here, let me do that.</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: No, I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>bean</strong>: Ahm - excuse me … You know..</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: Oh yes. Sorry. Though I think these are
ready.</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: There. Is that how you like them?</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: He’s not too bad. I can live with him.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’m afraid you don’t know the half of it. Sit
down. I have a tale to tell. And not a happy one.</p>
<p><strong>grierson</strong>: Colleagues - what can I say? Incidents
such as occurred yesterday teach a man important lessons. On reflection,
I realise it would have been a sin to sell Whistler’s Mother to such an
impertinent philistine as Governor Reynolds. And therefore, I blame
myself for having ever let things get to such a pass that we felt we had
realise our the staff - twelve got today, I’ve Schimmel as to sell her.
I suddenly problem here hasn’t been it’s been the leadership flabby,
lazy- And so decided to appoint Bernie my new Vice- President.</p>
<p><strong>grierson</strong>: He’s a man with a plan who will haul us
into profitability and the 21st century.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Thank you, sir. Although, I’m afraid I don’t
quite see how we can …</p>
<p><strong>grierson</strong>: Good point Bernie - precisely the kind of
perceptive interjection I’d expect from my new V.P. How can we, you ask,
survive without Whistler’s Mother - our single greatest asset? Well, the
truth is - we can’t. So what am I saying? Will we find her again? Never
- this robber was clearly the work of a criminal of great genius.</p>
<p><strong>grierson</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen. The REAL Whistler’s
Mother!</p>
<p><strong>grierson</strong>: The best security in the world is no match
for a master criminal. But no master criminal is a match for me. Thank
you all. Now if you would please return to your posts, my new Vice
President, Bernard Shimmel would like you all to see the computer
program we had prepared for yesterday until we were so rudely
interrupted by events.</p>
<p><strong>grierson</strong>: David, David, David …</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’m fired? Because I let a… copy of a
painting the get stolen?</p>
<p><strong>grierson</strong>: Of course not. I’m sacking you for
neglectful conduct, relating to the heavy financial loss this gallery
has incurred, through your recent lack of professional judgement. A loss
I trust Bernie will be able to reverse.</p>
<p><strong>grierson</strong>: I will of course invite you an excellent
reference - or Bernie will.</p>
<p><strong>grierson</strong>: Of course, Dr. Bean, we’ll arrange
alternative accommodation for you. I believe Bernie has a spare room
with en suite bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>grierson</strong>: How are you making out there?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: All fixed up, sir. Stick around, Davey boy.
This is going to be quite a show.</p>
<p>****: Here you can see our new interactive gallery guide. Every
picture in the gallery will have its own story to tell.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Perhaps you’d like to bring up Whistler’s
Mother.</p>
<p>****: Ah, Our visiting professor has chosen the splendid Millais
painting - “His Mistress”</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Just click on the corner.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Right let me take over now…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: You’ve had long enough on it now. A joke’s a
joke. That’s it. Period!</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: You can stop right there, Mr! Those are
confidential …</p>
<p><strong>bean</strong>: Daaa! Daaa!</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Excuse me, If I may just …</p>
<p><strong>grierson</strong>: Shut up, Schimmel. Exactly how long have
you been siphoning gallery money into your own private accounts?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Look at all this - publicity expenditure …
catering … all completely fictional … back as far as June 93 …</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: I don’t think you really understand what
you’re looking at …</p>
<p><strong>grierson</strong>: Horse shit. You’re dead, grease-ball.
Period.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: But wait a minute - you can’t let some moron
from England turn you against me. I deny any knowledge of this. He
probably typed in all this stuff himself. Don’t you find it all a bit
suspicious that it’s here at his fingertips. There’s your criminal,
gentlemen. There’s the Limey that set me up!</p>
<p><strong>grierson</strong>: Dr. Bean. Have you got anything to say to
that?</p>
<p><strong>bean</strong>: Yes- It’s exceedingly rude to point.</p>
<p><strong>grierson</strong>: I don’t know what your methods are these
days, Officer, but I’d</p>
<p><strong>side~kick</strong>: Oh, yeah - I forgot.</p>
<p><strong>grierson</strong>: I owe you a very serious apology, young
man. It wouldn’t surprise me if you wanted to leave us after this. I
sincerely hope that you do not.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: VERY ACCOMMODATING Well, no, sir, I’m sure
…</p>
<p><strong>grierson</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: And a car.</p>
<p><strong>grierson</strong>: Mmmmm…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Maybe two cars.</p>
<p><strong>grierson</strong>: A car sounds sensible.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: And I need Fridays off, to spend more time
with my family. Speaking of which - if you’ll excuse me …. I’ve got a
lot of time to make up.</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: well, it’s been… unusual. But thank you.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Good-bye Mr Bean. Sorry I screamed that
first time.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Come on hurry or we’ll be late.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: … Oh, and Grierson phoned Lord Walton at the
National. Said good things about you. So expect a great reception back
home, huh?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Good-bye Beanie. It’s Bean …. surreal. And
don’t forget you’re welcome to come back anytime …</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: … in the distant future.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Bye, Bean. Thanks for everything. And take
care, huh? I know it’s insane, but I’m going to miss you.</p>
<p><strong>cleaner</strong>: They’ve moved, guy.</p>
<p><strong>lord walton</strong>: Is he gone?</p>
<p><strong>miss hutchinson</strong>: Yes, my lord.</p>
<p><strong>lord walton</strong>: Tell the others.</p>
<p><strong>miss hutchinson</strong>: Very well, my lord.</p>
<p><strong>miss hutchinson</strong>: He’s gone.</p>
