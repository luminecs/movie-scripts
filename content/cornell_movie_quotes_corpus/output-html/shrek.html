<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Once upon a time there was a lovely princess.
But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only
be broken by love’s first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded
by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to
free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed. She waited in the
dragon’s keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love
and true love’s first kiss. Like that’s ever gonna happen. What a load
of -</p>
<p><strong>man1</strong>: Think it’s in there?</p>
<p><strong>man2</strong>: All right. Let’s get it!</p>
<p><strong>man1</strong>: Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can
do to you?</p>
<p><strong>man3</strong>: Yeah, it’ll grind your bones for it’s
bread.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Yes, well, actually, that would be a giant.
Now, ogres, oh they’re much worse. They’ll make a suit from your freshly
peeled skin.</p>
<p><strong>men</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: They’ll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly
from your eyes! Actually, it’s quite good on toast.</p>
<p><strong>man1</strong>: Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya!</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: This is the part where you run away. And stay
out! “Wanted. Fairy tale creatures.”</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: All right. This one’s full. Take it away!
Move it along. Come on! Get up!</p>
<p><strong>head guard</strong>: Next!</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Give me that! Your flying days are over.</p>
<p><strong>head guard</strong>: That’s 20 pieces of silver for the
witch. Next!</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Get up! Come on!</p>
<p><strong>head guard</strong>: Twenty pieces.</p>
<p><strong>little bear</strong>: This cage is too small.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Please, don’t turn me in. I’ll never be
stubborn again. I can change. Please! Give me another chance!</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Oh, shut up.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>head guard</strong>: Next! What have you got?</p>
<p><strong>gipetto</strong>: This little wooden puppet.</p>
<p><strong>pinocchio</strong>: I’m not a puppet. I’m a real boy.</p>
<p><strong>head guard</strong>: Five shillings for the possessed toy.
Take it away.</p>
<p><strong>pinocchio</strong>: Father, please! Don’t let them do this!
Help me!</p>
<p><strong>head guard</strong>: Next! What have you got?</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Well, I’ve got a talking donkey.</p>
<p><strong>head guard</strong>: Right. Well, that’s good for ten
shillings, if you can prove it.</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Oh, go ahead, little fella.</p>
<p><strong>head guard</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Oh, oh, he’s just…he’s just a little
nervous. He’s really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt…</p>
<p><strong>head guard</strong>: That’s it. I’ve heard enough.
Guards!</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: No, no, he talks! He does. I can talk. I
love to talk. I’m the talkingest damn thing you ever saw.</p>
<p><strong>head guard</strong>: Get her out of my sight.</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: No, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk!</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Hey! I can fly!</p>
<p><strong>peter pan</strong>: He can fly!</p>
<p><strong>3 little pigs</strong>: He can fly!</p>
<p><strong>head guard</strong>: He can talk!</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Ha, ha! That’s right, fool! Now I’m a
flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a
superfly but I bet you ain’t never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! Uh-oh.</p>
<p><strong>head guard</strong>: Seize him! After him!</p>
<p><strong>guards</strong>: He’s getting away! Get him! This way!
Turn!</p>
<p><strong>head guard</strong>: You there. Ogre!</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Aye?</p>
<p><strong>head guard</strong>: By the order of Lord Farquaad I am
authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a
designated resettlement facility.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Oh, really? You and what army?</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Can I say something to you? Listen, you was
really, really, really somethin’ back here. Incredible!</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Are you talkin’ to… me? around and Donkey is
right in front Whoa!</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Yes. I was talkin’ to you. Can I tell you
that you that you was great back here? Those guards! They thought they
was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin’ over
themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see
that.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Oh, that’s great. Really.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Man, it’s good to be free.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Now, why don’t you go celebrate your freedom
with your own friends? Hmm?</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: But, uh, I don’t have any friends. And I’m
not goin’ out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea!
I’ll stick with you. You’re mean, green, fightin’ machine. Together
we’ll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Oh, wow! That was really scary. If you don’t
mind me sayin’, if that don’t work, your breath certainly will get the
job done, ’cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, ’cause
you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like
the time… continues to talk, so Shrek removes …then I ate some rotten
berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Why are you following me?</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: I’ll tell you why. ’Cause I’m all alone,
There’s no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There’s no one
to deride me, But you gotta have faith…</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Stop singing! It’s no wonder you don’t have
any friends.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Wow. Only a true friend would be that
cruelly honest.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Listen, little donkey. Take a look at me.
What am I?</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Uh …really tall?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: No! I’m an ogre! You know. “Grab your torch
and pitchforks.” Doesn’t that bother you?</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Really, really.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Man, I like you. What’s you name?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Uh, Shrek.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Shrek? Well, you know what I like about you,
Shrek? You got that kind of I-don’t-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing.
I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. Whoa! Look at that.
Who’d want to live in place like that?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: That would be my home.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Oh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You
know you are quite a decorator. It’s amazing what you’ve done with such
a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess
you don’t entertain much, do you?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: I like my privacy.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: You know, I do too. That’s another thing we
have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face.
You’ve trying to give them a hint, and they won’t leave. There’s that
awkward silence. Can I stay with you?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Uh, what?</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Can I stay with you, please?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Of course!</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Please! I don’t wanna go back there! You
don’t know what it’s like to be considered a freak. Well, maybe you do.
But that’s why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please!
Please!</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Okay! Okay! But one night only.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Ah! Thank you!</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: What are you…? No! No!</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: This is gonna be fun! We can stay up late,
swappin’ manly stories, and in the mornin’ I’m makin’ waffles.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Where do, uh, I sleep?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Outside!</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Oh, well, I guess that’s cool. I mean, I
don’t know you, and you don’t know me, so I guess outside is best, you
know. Here I go. Good night. I mean, I do like the outdoors. I’m a
donkey. I was born outside. I’ll just be sitting by myself outside, I
guess, you know. By myself, outside. I’m all alone…there’s no one here
beside me…</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: I thought I told you to stay outside.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: I am outside.</p>
<p><strong>blind mouse1</strong>: Well, gents, it’s a far cry from the
farm, but what choice do we have?</p>
<p><strong>blind mouse2</strong>: It’s not home, but it’ll do just
fine.</p>
<p><strong>gordo</strong>: What a lovely bed.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Got ya.</p>
<p><strong>gordo</strong>: I found some cheese.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Ow!</p>
<p><strong>gordo</strong>: Blah! Awful stuff.</p>
<p><strong>blind mouse1</strong>: Is that you, Gordo?</p>
<p><strong>gordo</strong>: How did you know?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Enough! What are you doing in my house? Hey!
Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table.</p>
<p><strong>dwarf</strong>: Where are we supposed to put her? The bed’s
taken.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>big bad wolf</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: I live in a swamp. I put up signs. I’m a
terrifying ogre! What do I have to do get a little privacy? front door
to throw the Wolf out and he sees that all the collected Fairy Oh, no.
No! No!</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: What are you doing in my swamp?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: All right, get out of here. All of you, move
it! Come on! Let’s go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! No, no!
No, no. Not there. Not there. Oh!</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Hey, don’t look at me. I didn’t invite
them.</p>
<p><strong>pinocchio</strong>: Oh, gosh, no one invited us.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>pinocchio</strong>: We were forced to come here.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: By who?</p>
<p><strong>little pig</strong>: Lord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed
and he…signed an eviction notice.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy
is?</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Oh, I do. I know where he is.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Does anyone else know where to find him?
Anyone at all?</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Me! Me!</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Anyone?</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Oh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me,
me!</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things.
Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact,
I’m gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land
and back where you came from! Oh! You! You’re comin’ with me.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: All right, that’s what I like to hear, man.
Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city
adventure. I love it!</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek. I
can’t wait to get on the road again.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: What did I say about singing?</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Can I whistle?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Can I hum it?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: All right, hum it.</p>
<p><strong>farquaad</strong>: That’s enough. He’s ready to talk.</p>
<p><strong>farquaad</strong>: Run, run, run, as fast as you can. You
can’t catch me. I’m the gingerbread man.</p>
<p><strong>gingerbread man</strong>: You are a monster.</p>
<p><strong>farquaad</strong>: I’m not the monster here. You are. You and
the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell
me! Where are the others?</p>
<p><strong>gingerbread man</strong>: Eat me!</p>
<p><strong>farquaad</strong>: I’ve tried to be fair to you creatures.
Now my patience has reached its end! Tell me or I’ll…</p>
<p><strong>gingerbread man</strong>: No, no, not the buttons. Not my
gumdrop buttons.</p>
<p><strong>farquaad</strong>: All right then. Who’s hiding them?</p>
<p><strong>gingerbread man</strong>: Okay, I’ll tell you. Do you know
the muffin man?</p>
<p><strong>farquaad</strong>: The muffin man?</p>
<p><strong>gingerbread man</strong>: The muffin man.</p>
<p><strong>farquaad</strong>: Yes, I know the muffin man, who lives on
Drury Lane?</p>
<p><strong>gingerbread man</strong>: Well, she’s married to the muffin
man.</p>
<p><strong>farquaad</strong>: The muffin man?</p>
<p><strong>gingerbread man</strong>: The muffin man!</p>
<p><strong>farquaad</strong>: She’s married to the muffin man.</p>
<p><strong>head guard</strong>: My lord! We found it.</p>
<p><strong>farquaad</strong>: Then what are you waiting for? Bring it
in.</p>
<p><strong>gingerbread man</strong>: Ohhhh…</p>
<p><strong>farquaad</strong>: Magic mirror…</p>
<p><strong>gingerbread man</strong>: Don’t tell him anything! him up and
dumps him into a trash can No!</p>
<p><strong>farquaad</strong>: Evening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is
this not the most perfect kingdom of them all?</p>
<p><strong>mirror</strong>: Well, technically you’re not a king.</p>
<p><strong>farquaad</strong>: Uh, Thelonius. hand mirror and smashes it
with his You were saying?</p>
<p><strong>mirror</strong>: What I mean is you’re not a king yet. But
you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess.</p>
<p><strong>farquaad</strong>: Go on.</p>
<p><strong>mirror</strong>: So, just sit back and relax, my lord,
because it’s time for you to meet today’s eligible bachelorettes. And
here they are! Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from
a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her
hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please
welcome Cinderella. Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from
the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she’s not
easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she
is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! And last, but certainly not
last, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded
castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But don’t let that cool you off.
She’s a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the
rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! So will it be bachelorette
number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three?</p>
<p><strong>guards</strong>: Two! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three!</p>
<p><strong>farquaad</strong>: Three? One? Three?</p>
<p><strong>thelonius</strong>: Three! Pick number three, my lord!</p>
<p><strong>farquaad</strong>: Okay, okay, uh, number three!</p>
<p><strong>mirror</strong>: Lord Farquaad, you’ve chosen Princess
Fiona.</p>
<p><strong>farquaad</strong>: Princess Fiona. She’s perfect. All I have
to do is just find someone who can go…</p>
<p><strong>mirror</strong>: But I probably should mention the little
thing that happens at night.</p>
<p><strong>farquaad</strong>: I’ll do it.</p>
<p><strong>mirror</strong>: Yes, but after sunset…</p>
<p><strong>farquaad</strong>: Silence! I will make this Princess Fiona
my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect king! Captain,
assemble your finest men. We’re going to have a tournament.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: But that’s it. That’s it right there. That’s
DuLoc. I told ya I’d find it.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: So, that must be Lord Farquaad’s castle.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Uh-huh. That’s the place.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Do you think maybe he’s compensating for
something? groans as Donkey doesn’t get the joke. He continues walking
through the parking</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Hey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Hurry, darling. We’re late. Hurry.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Hey, you! a giant head that looks like Lord
Farquaad, screams and begins running through the rows of rope to get to
the front gate Wait a second. Look, I’m not gonna eat you. I just - - I
just - - walking straight through the rows. The attendant runs into a
wall and falls down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: It’s quiet. Too quiet. Where is
everybody?</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Hey, look at this!</p>
<p><strong>wooden people</strong>: Welcome to DuLoc such a perfect
town</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Wow! Let’s do that again!</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: No. No. No, no, no! No.</p>
<p><strong>farquaad</strong>: Brave knights. You are the best and
brightest in all the land. Today one of you shall prove himself…</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: All right. You’re going the right way for a
smacked bottom.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Sorry about that.</p>
<p><strong>farquaad</strong>: That champion shall have the honor - - no,
no - - the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona
from the fiery keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is
unsuccessful, the first runner-up will take his place and so on and so
forth. Some of you may die, but it’s a sacrifice I am willing to make.
Let the tournament begin! Oh! What is that? It’s hideous!</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Ah, that’s not very nice. It’s just a
donkey.</p>
<p><strong>farquaad</strong>: Indeed. Knights, new plan! The one who
kills the ogre will be named champion! Have it him!</p>
<p><strong>men</strong>: Get him!</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Oh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. into a
table where there are mugs of</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: Go ahead! Get him!</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Can’t we just settle this over a pint?</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: Kill the beast!</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: No? All right then. Come on!</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Hey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me!</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: The chair! Give him the chair!</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Oh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very
much! I’m here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha!</p>
<p><strong>head guard</strong>: Shall I give the order, sir?</p>
<p><strong>farquaad</strong>: No, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc,
I give you our champion!</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>farquaad</strong>: Congratulations, ogre. You’re won the
honor of embarking on a great and noble quest.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Quest? I’m already in a quest, a quest to get
my swamp back.</p>
<p><strong>farquaad</strong>: Your swamp?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Yeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairy
tale creatures!</p>
<p><strong>farquaad</strong>: Indeed. All right, ogre. I’ll make you a
deal. Go on this quest for me, and I’ll give you your swamp back.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Exactly the way it was?</p>
<p><strong>farquaad</strong>: Down to the last slime-covered
toadstool.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: And the squatters?</p>
<p><strong>farquaad</strong>: As good as gone.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: What kind of quest?</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Let me get this straight. You’re gonna go
fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back
a swamp which you only don’t have because he filled it full of freaks in
the first place. Is that about right?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: You know, maybe there’s a good reason donkeys
shouldn’t talk.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: I don’t get it. Why don’t you just pull some
of that ogre stuff on him? Throttle him, lay siege to his fortress,
grinds his bones to make your bread, the whole ogre trip.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Oh, I know what. Maybe I could have
decapitated an entire village and put their heads on a pike, gotten a
knife, cut open their spleen and drink their fluids. Does that sound
good to you?</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Uh, no, not really, no.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: For your information, there’s a lot more to
ogres than people think.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Example?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Example? Okay, um, ogres are like onions.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: They stink?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Yes - - No!</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: They make you cry?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: You leave them in the sun, they get all
brown, start sproutin’ little white hairs.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: No! Layers! Onions have layers. Ogres have
layers! Onions have layers. You get it? We both have layers.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Oh, you both have layers. Oh. {Sniffs} You
know, not everybody likes onions. Cake! Everybody loves cakes! Cakes
have layers.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: I don’t care… what everyone likes. Ogres are
not like cakes.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: You know what else everybody likes?
Parfaits. Have you ever met a person, you say, “Let’s get some parfait,”
they say, “Hell no, I don’t like no parfait”? Parfaits are
delicious.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: No! You dense, irritating, miniature beast of
burden! Ogres are like onions! And of story. Bye-bye. See ya later.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Parfaits may be the most delicious thing on
the whole damn planet.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: You know, I think I preferred your
humming.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Do you have a tissue or something? I’m
making a mess. Just the word parfait make me start slobbering.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Ohh! Shrek! Did you do that? You gotta warn
somebody before you just crack one off. My mouth was open and
everything.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Believe me, Donkey, if it was me, you’d be
dead. It’s brimstone. We must be getting close.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Yeah, right, brimstone. Don’t be talking
about it’s the brimstone. I know what I smell. It wasn’t no brimstone.
It didn’t come off no stone neither.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Sure, it’s big enough, but look at the
location.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Uh, Shrek? Uh, remember when you said ogres
have layers?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Oh, aye.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Well, I have a bit of a confession to make.
Donkeys don’t have layers. We wear our fear right out there on our
sleeves.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Wait a second. Donkeys don’t have
sleeves.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: You know what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: You can’t tell me you’re afraid of
heights.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: No, I’m just a little uncomfortable about
being on a rickety bridge over a boiling like of lava!</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Come on, Donkey. I’m right here beside ya,
okay? For emotional support., we’ll just tackle this thing together one
little baby step at a time.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Really, really.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Okay, that makes me feel so much better.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Just keep moving. And don’t look down.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Okay, don’t look down. Don’t look down.
Don’t look down. Keep on moving. Don’t look down. board and ends up
looking straight down Shrek! I’m lookin’ down! Oh, God, I can’t do this!
Just let me off, please!</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: But you’re already halfway.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: But I know that half is safe!</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Okay, fine. I don’t have time for this. You
go back.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Shrek, no! Wait!</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Just, Donkey - - Let’s have a dance then,
shall me?</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Don’t do that!</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Oh, I’m sorry. Do what? Oh, this?</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Yes, that!</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Yes? Yes, do it. Okay. bounce and sway as he
backs Donkey across</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: No, Shrek! No! Stop it!</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: You said do it! I’m doin’ it.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: I’m gonna die. I’m gonna die. Shrek, I’m
gonna die. Oh!</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: That’ll do, Donkey. That’ll do.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Cool. So where is this fire-breathing
pain-in-the-neck anyway?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Inside, waiting for us to rescue her.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: I was talkin’ about the dragon, Shrek.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: You afraid?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: But…</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Shh.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Oh, good. Me neither. ‘Cause there’s nothin’
wrong with bein’ afraid. Fear’s a sensible response to an unfamiliar
situation. Unfamiliar dangerous situation, I might add. With a dragon
that breathes fire and eats knights and breathes fire, it sure doesn’t
mean you’re a coward if you’re a little scared. I sure as heck ain’t no
coward. I know that.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Donkey, two things, okay? Shut … up. Now go
over there and see if you can find any stairs.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Stairs? I thought we was lookin’ for the
princess.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: The princess will be up the stairs in the
highest room in the tallest tower.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: What makes you think she’ll be there?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: I read it in a book once.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Cool. You handle the dragon. I’ll handle the
stairs. I’ll find those stairs. I’ll whip their butt too. Those stairs
won’t know which way they’re goin’.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: I’m gonna take drastic steps. Kick it to the
curb. Don’t mess with me. I’m the stair master. I’ve mastered the
stairs. I wish I had a step right here. I’d step all over it.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Well, at least we know where the princess is,
but where’s the…</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Dragon!</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Donkey, look out! a hold of the dragons tail
and holds Got ya!</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Oh! Aah! Aah!</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: No. Oh, no, No! Oh, what large teeth you
have. I mean white, sparkling teeth. I know you probably hear this all
time from your food, but you must bleach, ’cause that is one dazzling
smile you got there. Do I detect a hint of minty freshness? And you know
what else? You’re - - You’re a girl dragon! Oh, sure! I mean, of course
you’re a girl dragon. You’re just reeking of feminine beauty. What’s the
matter with you? You got something in your eye? Ohh. Oh. Oh. Man, I’d
really love to stay, but you know, I’m, uh… blows a smoke ring in the
shape of a I’m an asthmatic, and I don’t know if it’d work out if you’re
gonna blow smoke rings. Shrek! No! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: Oh! Oh!</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Wake up!</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Are you Princess Fiona?</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: I am, awaiting a knight so bold as to rescue
me.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Oh, that’s nice. Now let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: But wait, Sir Knight. This be-ith our first
meeting. Should it not be a wonderful, romantic moment?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Yeah, sorry, lady. There’s no time.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: Hey, wait. What are you doing? You should
sweep me off my feet out yonder window and down a rope onto your valiant
steed.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: You’ve had a lot of time to plan this,
haven’t you?</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: But we have to savor this moment! You could
recite an epic poem for me. A ballad? A sonnet! A limerick? Or
something!</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: Can I at least know the name of my
champion?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Uh, Shrek.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: Sir Shrek. I pray that you take this favor as
a token of my gratitude.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: You didn’t slay the dragon?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: It’s on my to-do list. Now come on!</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: But this isn’t right! You were meant to
charge in, sword drawn, banner flying. That’s what all the other knights
did.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Yeah, right before they burst into flame.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: That’s not the point. Oh! ignores her and
heads for a wooden door Wait. Where are you going? The exit’s over
there.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Well, I have to save my ass.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: What kind of knight are you?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: One of a kind.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Slow down. Slow down, baby, please. I
believe it’s healthy to get to know someone over a long period of time.
Just call me old-fashioned. from a distance as Shrek sneaks into I don’t
want to rush into a physical relationship. I’m not emotionally ready for
a commitment of, uh, this - - Magnitude really is the word I’m looking
for. Magnitude- - Hey, that is unwanted physical contact. Hey, what are
you doing? Okay, okay. Let’s just back up a little and take this one
step at a time. We really should get to know each other first as friends
or pen pals. I’m on the road a lot, but I just love receiving cards - -
I’d really love to stay, but - - Don’t do that! That’s my tail! That’s
my personal tail. You’re gonna tear it off. I don’t give permission - -
What are you gonna do with that? Hey, now. No way. No! No! No, no!
No. No, no, no. No! Oh!</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Hi, Princess!</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: It talks!</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Yeah, it’s getting him to shut up that’s the
trick.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Okay, you two, heard for the exit! I’ll take
care of the dragon.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Run!</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: You did it! You rescued me! You’re amazing.
You’re - - You’re wonderful. You’re… a little unorthodox I’ll admit. But
thy deed is great, and thy heart is pure. I am eternally in your debt.
And where would a brave knight be without his noble steed?</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: I hope you heard that. She called me a noble
steed. She think I’m a steed.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: The battle is won. You may remove your
helmet, good Sir Knight.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Uh, no.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: I have helmet hair.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: Please. I would’st look upon the face of my
rescuer.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: No, no, you wouldn’t - - ’st.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: But how will you kiss me?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: What? That wasn’t in the job description.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Maybe it’s a perk.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: No, it’s destiny. Oh, you must know how it
goes. A princess locked in a tower and beset by a dragon is rescued by a
brave knight, and then they share true love’s first kiss.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Hmm? With Shrek? You think- - Wait. Wait.
You think that Shrek is you true love?</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: Well, yes.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: You think Shrek is your true love!</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: What is so funny?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Let’s just say I’m not your type, okay?Fiona:
Of course, you are. You’re my rescuer. Now - - Now remove your
helmet.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Look. I really don’t think this is a good
idea.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: Just take off the helmet.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: I’m not going to.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: Take it off.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: Now!</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Okay! Easy. As you command. Your
Highness.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: You- - You’re a- - an ogre.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: Well, yes, actually. Oh, no. This is all
wrong. You’re not supposed to be an ogre.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Princess, I was sent to rescue you by Lord
Farquaad, okay? He is the one who wants to marry you.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: Then why didn’t he come rescue me?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Good question. You should ask him that when
we get there.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: But I have to be rescued by my true love, not
by some ogre and his- - his pet.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Well, so much for noble steed.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: You’re not making my job any easier.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: I’m sorry, but your job is not my problem.
You can tell Lord Farquaad that if he wants to rescue me properly, I’ll
be waiting for him right here.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Hey! I’m no one’s messenger boy, all right?
I’m a delivery boy. her over his shoulder like she was a</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: You wouldn’t dare. Put me down!</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Ya comin’, Donkey?</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: I’m right behind ya.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: Put me down, or you will suffer the
consequences! This is not dignified! Put me down!</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Okay, so here’s another question. Say
there’s a woman that digs you, right, but you don’t really like her that
way. How do you let her down real easy so her feelings aren’t hurt, but
you don’t get burned to a crisp and eaten?</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: You just tell her she’s not your true love.
Everyone knows what happens when you find your… Hey! The sooner we get
to DuLoc the better.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: You’re gonna love it there, Princess. It’s
beautiful!</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: And what of my groom-to-be? Lord Farquaad?
What’s he like?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Let me put it this way, Princess. Men of
Farquaad’s stature are in short supply.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: I don’t know. There are those who think
little of him. Fiona: Stop it. Stop it, both of you. You’re just jealous
you can never measure up to a great ruler like Lord Farquaad.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Yeah, well, maybe you’re right, Princess. But
I’ll let you do the “measuring” when you see him tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: Tomorrow? It’ll take that long? Shouldn’t we
stop to make camp?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: No, that’ll take longer. We can keep
going.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: But there’s robbers in the woods.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Whoa! Time out, Shrek! Camp is starting to
sound good.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Hey, come on. I’m scarier than anything we’re
going to see in this forest.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: I need to find somewhere to camp now!</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Hey! Over here.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Shrek, we can do better than that. I don’t
think this is fit for a princess.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: No, no, it’s perfect. It just needs a few
homey touches.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Homey touches? Like what? a tearing noise and
looks over at Fiona</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: A door? Well, gentlemen, I bid thee good
night.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: You want me to read you a bedtime story? I
will.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: I said good night!</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Shrek, What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: I just- - You know - - Oh, come on. I was
just kidding.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: And, uh, that one, that’s Throwback, the only
ogre to ever spit over three wheat fields.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Right. Yeah. Hey, can you tell my future
from these stars?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: The stars don’t tell the future, Donkey. They
tell stories. Look, there’s Bloodnut, the Flatulent. You can guess what
he’s famous for.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: I know you’re making this up.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: No, look. There he is, and there’s the group
of hunters running away from his stench.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: That ain’t nothin’ but a bunch of little
dots.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: You know, Donkey, sometimes things are more
than they appear. Hmm? Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Hey, Shrek, what we gonna do when we get our
swamp anyway?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Our swamp?</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: You know, when we’re through rescuing the
princess.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: We? Donkey, there’s no “we”. There’s no
“our”. There’s just me and my swamp. The first thing I’m gonna do is
build a ten-foot wall around my land.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: You cut me deep, Shrek. You cut me real deep
just now. You know what I think? I think this whole wall thing is just a
way to keep somebody out.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: No, do ya think?</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Are you hidin’ something?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Never mind, Donkey.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Oh, this is another one of those onion
things, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: No, this is one of those drop-it and leave-it
alone things.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Why don’t you want to talk about it?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Why do you want to talk about it?</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Why are you blocking?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: I’m not blocking.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Oh, yes, you are.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Donkey, I’m warning you.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Who you trying to keep out?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Everyone! Okay?</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Oh, now we’re gettin’ somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Oh! For the love of Pete! walks over to the
edge of the cliff</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: What’s your problem? What you got against
the whole world anyway?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Look, I’m not the one with the problem, okay?
It’s the world that seems to have a problem with me. People take one
look at me and go. “Aah! Help! Run! A big, stupid, ugly ogre!” They
judge me before they even know me. That’s why I’m better off alone.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: You know what? When we met, I didn’t think
you was just a big, stupid, ugly ogre.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Yeah, I know.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: So, uh, are there any donkeys up there?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Well, there’s, um, Gabby, the Small and
Annoying.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Okay, okay, I see it now. The big shiny one,
right there. That one there?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: That’s the moon.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Oh, okay.</p>
<p><strong>farquaad</strong>: Again, show me again. Mirror, mirror, show
her to me. Show me the princess.</p>
<p><strong>mirror</strong>: Hmph.</p>
<p><strong>farquaad</strong>: Ah. Perfect.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Mmm, yeah, you know I like it like that.
Come on, baby. I said I like it.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Donkey, wake up.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Huh? What?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Wake up.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: Good morning. Hm, how do you like your
eggs?</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Oh, good morning, Princess!</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: What’s all this about?</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: You know, we kind of got off to a bad start
yesterday. I wanted to make it up to you. I mean, after all, you did
rescue me.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Uh, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: Well, eat up. We’ve got a big day ahead of
us.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Shrek!</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: What? It’s a compliment. Better out than in,
I always say.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Well, it’s no way to behave in front of a
princess.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: She’s as nasty as you are.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: You know, you’re not exactly what I
expected.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: Well, maybe you shouldn’t judge people before
you get to know them.</p>
<p><strong>robin hood</strong>: La liberte! Hey!</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Princess!</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>robin hood</strong>: Be still, mon cherie, for I am you
savior! And I am rescuing you from this green… up her arm while Fiona
pulls back in …beast.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Hey! That’s my princess! Go find you own!</p>
<p><strong>robin hood</strong>: Please, monster! Can’t you see I’m a
little busy here?</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: Look, pal, I don’t know who you think you
are!</p>
<p><strong>robin hood</strong>: Oh! Of course! Oh, how rude. Please let
me introduce myself. Oh, Merry Men.</p>
<p><strong>merry men</strong>: Ta, dah, dah, dah, whoo.</p>
<p><strong>robin hood</strong>: I steal from the rich and give to the
needy.</p>
<p><strong>merry men</strong>: He takes a wee percentage,</p>
<p><strong>robin hood</strong>: But I’m not greedy. I rescue pretty
damsels, man, I’m good.</p>
<p><strong>merry men</strong>: What a guy, Monsieur Hood.</p>
<p><strong>robin hood</strong>: Break it down. I like an honest fight
and a saucy little maid…</p>
<p><strong>merry men</strong>: What he’s basically saying is he likes to
get…</p>
<p><strong>robin hood</strong>: Paid. So…When an ogre in the bush grabs
a lady by the tush. That’s bad.</p>
<p><strong>merry men</strong>: That’s bad.</p>
<p><strong>robin hood</strong>: When a beauty’s with a beast it makes me
awfully mad.</p>
<p><strong>merry men</strong>: He’s mad, he’s really, really mad.</p>
<p><strong>robin hood</strong>: I’ll take my blade and ram it through
your heart, keep your eyes on me, boys ’cause I’m about to start…</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: Man, that was annoying!</p>
<p><strong>merry man</strong>: Oh, you little- -</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: Uh, shall we?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Hold the phone. Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on
now. Where did that come from?</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: That! Back there. That was amazing! Where did
you learn that?</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: Well… when one lives alone, uh, one has to
learn these things in case there’s a… there’s an arrow in your butt!</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: What? Oh, would you look at that?</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: Oh, no. This is all my fault. I’m so
sorry.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Why? What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: Shrek’s hurt.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Shrek’s hurt. Shrek’s hurt? Oh, no, Shrek’s
gonna die.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Donkey, I’m okay.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: You can’t do this to me, Shrek. I’m too
young for you to die. Keep you legs elevated. Turn your head and cough.
Does anyone know the Heimlich?</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: Donkey! Calm down. If you want to help Shrek,
run into the woods and find me a blue flower with red thorns.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Blue flower, red thorns. Okay, I’m on it.
Blue flower, red thorns. Don’t die Shrek. If you see a long tunnel, stay
away from the light!</p>
<p><strong>shrek &amp; fiona</strong>: Donkey!</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Oh, yeah. Right. Blue flower, red
thorns.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: What are the flowers for?</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: For getting rid of Donkey.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Ah.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: Now you hold still, and I’ll yank this thing
out.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Ow! Hey! Easy with the yankin’.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: I’m sorry, but it has to come out.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: No, it’s tender.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: Now, hold on.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: What you’re doing is the opposite of
help.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: Don’t move.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Look, time out.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: Would you… hand over her face to stop her
from Okay. What do you propose we do?</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red
thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. This would be so much easier if I
wasn’t color-blind! Blue flower, red thorns.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Ow!</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Hold on, Shrek! I’m comin’! flower off a
nearby bush that just happens</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Ow! Not good.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: Okay. Okay. I can nearly see the head. It’s
just about…</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Ow! Ohh!</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Ahem.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Nothing happend. We were just, uh - -</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Look, if you wanted to be alone, all you had
to do was ask. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Oh, come on! That’s the last thing on my
mind. The princess here was just- - Ugh! turns to look at Fiona who
holds up Ow!</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Hey, what’s that? That’s…is that blood?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: There it is, Princess. Your future awaits
you.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: That’s DuLoc?</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Yeah, I know. You know, Shrek thinks Lord
Farquaad’s compensating for something, which I think means he has a
really… Ow!</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Um, I, uh- - I guess we better move on.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: Sure. But, Shrek? I’m - - I’m worried about
Donkey.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: I mean, look at him. He doesn’t look so
good.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: What are you talking about? I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: That’s what they always say, and then next
thing you know, you’re on your back. Dead.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: You know, she’s right. You look awful. Do you
want to sit down?</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: Uh, you know, I’ll make you some tea.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: I didn’t want to say nothin’, but I got this
twinge in my neck, and when I turn my head like this, look, his neck in
a very sharp way until his Ow! See?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Who’s hungry? I’ll find us some dinner.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: I’ll get the firewood.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Hey, where you goin’? Oh, man, I can’t feel
my toes! I don’t have any toes! I think I need a hug.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: Mmm. This is good. This is really good. What
is this?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Uh, weed rat. Rotisserie style.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: No kidding. Well, this is delicious.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Well, they’re also great in stews. Now, I
don’t mean to brag, but I make a mean weed rat stew.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: I guess I’ll be dining a little differently
tomorrow night.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Maybe you can come visit me in the swamp
sometime. I’ll cook all kind of stuff for you. Swamp toad soup, fish eye
tartare - - you name it.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: I’d like that.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Um, Princess?</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: Yes, Shrek?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: I, um, I was wondering…are you… Are you gonna
eat that?</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Man, isn’t this romantic? Just look at that
sunset.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: Sunset? Oh, no! I mean, it’s late. I-It’s
very late.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Wait a minute. I see what’s goin’ on here.
You’re afraid of the dark, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: Yes! Yes, that’s it. I’m terrified. You know,
I’d better go inside.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Don’t feel bad, Princess. I used to be
afraid of the dark, too, until - - Hey, no, wait. I’m still afraid of
the dark.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Ohh! Now I really see what’s goin’ on
here.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Oh, what are you talkin’ about?</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: I don’t even wanna hear it. Look, I’m an
animal, and I got instincts. And I know you two were diggin’ on each
other. I could feel it.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: You’re crazy. I’m just bringing her back to
Farquaad.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Oh, come on, Shrek. Wake up and smell the
pheromones. Just go on in and tell her how you feel.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: I- - There’s nothing to tell. Besides, even
if I did tell her that, well, you know - - and I’m not sayin’ I do
’cause I don’t - - she’s a princess, and I’m - -</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: An ogre?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Yeah. An ogre.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Hey, where you goin’?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: To get… move firewood.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Princess? Princess Fiona? Princess, where
are you? Princess?</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: It’s very spooky in here. I ain’t playing no
games.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Aah!</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: Oh, no!</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: No, help!</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: Shh!</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: No, it’s okay. It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: What did you do with the princess?</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: Donkey, I’m the princess.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Aah!</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: It’s me, in this body.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Oh, my God! You ate the princess. Can you
hear me?</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: Donkey!</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Listen, keep breathing! I’ll get you out of
there!</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: Shh.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Shrek!</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: This is me.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Princess? What happened to you? You’re, uh,
uh, uh, different.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: I’m ugly, okay?</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Well, yeah! Was it something you ate? ’Cause
I told Shrek those rats was a bad idea. You are what you eat, I said.
Now - -</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: No. I - - I’ve been this way as long as I can
remember.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: What do you mean? Look, I ain’t never seen
you like this before.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: It only happens when sun goes down. “By night
one way, by day another. This shall be the norm… until you find true
love’s first kiss… and then take love’s true form.”</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Ah, that’s beautiful. I didn’t know you
wrote poetry.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: It’s a spell. When I was a little girl, a
witch cast a spell on me. Every night I become this. This horrible, ugly
beast! I was placed in a tower to await the day my true love would
rescue me. That’s why I have to marry Lord Farquaad tomorrow before the
sun sets and he sees me like this.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: All right, all right. Calm down. Look, it’s
not that bad. You’re not that ugly. Well, I ain’t gonna lie. You are
ugly. But you only look like this at night. Shrek’s ugly 24-7.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: But Donkey, I’m a princess, and this is not
how a princess is meant to look.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Princess, how ’bout if you don’t marry
Farquaad?</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: I have to. Only my true love’s kiss can break
the spell.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: But, you know, um, you’re kind of an orge,
and Shrek - - well, you got a lot in common.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: Shrek?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Princess, I - - Uh, how’s it going, first of
all? Good? Um, good for me too. I’m okay. I saw this flower and thought
of you because it’s pretty and - - well, I don’t really like it, but I
thought you might like it ’cause you’re pretty. But I like you anyway.
I’d - - uh, uh… I’m in trouble. Okay, here we go.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: I can’t just marry whoever I want. Take a
good look at me, Donkey. I mean, really, who can ever love a beast so
hideous and ugly? “Princess” and “ugly” don’t go together. That’s why I
can’t stay here with Shrek.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: My only chance to live happily ever after is
to marry my true love.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: Don’t you see, Donkey? That’s just how it has
to be. It’s the only way to break the spell.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: You at least gotta tell Shrek the truth.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: No! You can’t breathe a word. No one must
ever know.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: What’s the point of being able to talk if
you gotta keep secrets?</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: Promise you won’t tell. Promise!</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: All right, all right. I won’t tell him. But
you should. I just know before this is over, I’m gonna need a whole lot
of serious therapy. Look at my eye twitchin’.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: I tell him, I tell him not. I tell him, I
tell him not. I tell him. Shrek! Shrek, there’s something I want… looks
and sees the rising sun, and as the sun crests the sky she turns
back</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: Shrek. Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Perfect! Never been better.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: I - - I don’t - - There’s something I have to
tell you.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: You don’t have to tell me anything, Princess.
I heard enough last night.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: You heard what I said?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Every word.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: I thought you’d understand.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Oh, I understand. Like you said, “Who could
love a hideous, ugly beast?”</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: But I thought that wouldn’t matter to
you.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Yeah? Well, it does. him in shock. He looks
past her and Ah, right on time. Princess, I’ve brought you a little
something.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: What’d I miss? What’d I miss? Who said that?
Couldn’t have been the donkey.</p>
<p><strong>farquaad</strong>: Princess Fiona.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: As promised. Now hand it over.</p>
<p><strong>farquaad</strong>: Very well, ogre. The deed to your swamp,
cleared out, as agreed. Take it and go before I change my mind. Forgive
me, Princess, for startling you, but you startled me, for I have never
seen such a radiant beauty before. I’m Lord Farquaad.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: Lord Farquaad? Oh, no, no. Forgive me, my
lord, for I was just saying a short… as Farquaad is lifted off his horse
and set down in front of her. He comes farewell.</p>
<p><strong>farquaad</strong>: Oh, that is so sweet. You don’t have to
waste good manners on the ogre. It’s not like it has feelings.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: No, you’re right. It doesn’t.</p>
<p><strong>farquaad</strong>: Princess Fiona, beautiful, fair, flawless
Fiona. I ask your hand in marriage. Will you be the perfect bride for
the perfect groom?</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: Lord Farquaad, I accept. Nothing would make -
-</p>
<p><strong>farquaad</strong>: Excellent! I’ll start the plans, for
tomorrow we wed!</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: No! I mean, uh, why wait? Let’s get married
today before the sun sets.</p>
<p><strong>farquaad</strong>: Oh, anxious, are you? You’re right. The
sooner, the better. There’s so much to do! There’s the caterer, the
cake, the band, the guest list. Captain, round up some guests!</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: Fare-thee-well, ogre.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Shrek, what are you doing? You’re letting
her get away.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Yeah? So what?</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Shrek, there’s something about her you don’t
know. Look, I talked to her last night, She’s - -</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: I know you talked to her last night. You’re
great pals, aren’t ya? Now, if you two are such good friends, why don’t
you follow her home?</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Shrek, I - - I wanna go with you.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: I told you, didn’t I? You’re not coming home
with me. I live alone! My swamp! Me! Nobody else! Understand? Nobody!
Especially useless, pathetic, annoying, talking donkeys!</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: But I thought - -</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Yeah. You know what? You thought wrong!</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Shrek.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Donkey? What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: I would think, of all people, you would
recognize a wall when you see one.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Well, yeah. But the wall’s supposed to go
around my swamp, not through it.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: It is around your half. See that’s your
half, and this is my half.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Oh! Your half. Hmm.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Yes, my half. I helped rescue the princess.
I did half the work. I get half the booty. Now hand me that big old
rock, the one that looks like your head.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Back off!</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: No, you back off.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: This is my swamp!</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Our swamp.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Let go, Donkey!</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: You let go.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Stubborn jackass!</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Smelly ogre.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Fine!</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Hey, hey, come back here. I’m not through
with you yet.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Well, I’m through with you.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Uh-uh. You know, with you it’s always, “Me,
me, me!” Well, guess what! Now it’s my turn! So you just shut up and pay
attention! You are mean to me. You insult me and you don’t appreciate
anything that I do! You’re always pushing me around or pushing me
away.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you so bad, how
come you came back?</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Because that’s what friends do! They forgive
each other!</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Oh, yeah. You’re right, Donkey. I forgive
you… for stabbin’ me in the back!</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Ohh! You’re so wrapped up in layers, onion
boy, you’re afraid of your own feelings.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Go away!</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: There you are , doing it again just like you
did to Fiona. All she ever do was like you, maybe even love you.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Love me? She said I was ugly, a hideous
creature. I heard the two of you talking.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: She wasn’t talkin’ about you. She was
talkin’ about, uh, somebody else.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: She wasn’t talking about me? Well, then who
was she talking about?</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Uh-uh, no way. I ain’t saying anything. You
don’t wanna listen to me. Right? Right?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Donkey!</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Okay, look. I’m sorry, all right? I’m sorry.
I guess I am just a big, stupid, ugly ogre. Can you forgive me?</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Hey, that’s what friends are for, right?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Right. Friends?</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Friends.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: So, um, what did Fiona say about me?</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: What are you asking me for? Why don’t you
just go ask her?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: The wedding! We’ll never make it in time.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Ha-ha-ha! Never fear, for where, there’s a
will, there’s a way and I have a way.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Donkey?</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: I guess it’s just my animal magnetism.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Aw, come here, you.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: All right, all right. Don’t get all
slobbery. No one likes a kiss ass. All right, hop on and hold on tight.
I haven’t had a chance to install the seat belts yet.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: People of DuLoc, we gather here today to
bear witness to the union….</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: Um-</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: …of our new king…</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: Excuse me. Could we just skip ahead to the “I
do’s”?</p>
<p><strong>farquaad</strong>: Go on.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Go ahead, HAVE SOME FUN. If we need you,
I’ll whistle. How about that? Shrek, wait, wait! Wait a minute! You
wanna do this right, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: There’s a line you gotta wait for. The
preacher’s gonna say, “Speak now or forever hold your peace.” That’s
when you say, “I object!”</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: I don’t have time for this!</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Hey, wait. What are you doing? Listen to me!
Look, you love this woman, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: You wanna hold her?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Please her?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Then you got to, got to try a little
tenderness. The chicks love that romantic crap!</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: All right! Cut it out. When does this guy say
the line?</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: We gotta check it out.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: And so, by the power vested in me…</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: What do you see?</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: The whole town’s in there.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: I now pronounce you husband and wife…</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: They’re at the altar.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: …king and queen.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Mother Fletcher! He already said it.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Oh, for the love of Pete!</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: I object!</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: Shrek?</p>
<p><strong>farquaad</strong>: Oh, now what does he want?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Hi, everyone. Havin’ a good time, are ya? I
love DuLoc, first of all. Very clean.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Really, it’s rude enough being alive when no
one wants you, but showing up uninvited to a wedding…</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Fiona! I need to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: Oh, now you wanna talk? It’s a little late
for that, so if you’ll excuse me - -</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: But you can’t marry him.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: And why not?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Because- - Because he’s just marring you so
he can be king.</p>
<p><strong>farquaad</strong>: Outrageous! Fiona, don’t listen to
him.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: He’s not your true love.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: And what do you know about true love?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Well, I - - Uh - - I mean - -</p>
<p><strong>farquaad</strong>: Oh, this is precious. The ogee has fallen
in love with the princess! Oh, good Lord.</p>
<p><strong>farquaad</strong>: An ogre and a princess!</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: Shrek, is this true?</p>
<p><strong>farquaad</strong>: Who cares? It’s preposterous! Fiona, my
love, we’re but a kiss away from our “happily ever after.” Now kiss
me!</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: “By night one way, by day another.” I wanted
to show you before.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Well, uh, that explains a lot.</p>
<p><strong>farquaad</strong>: Ugh! It’s disgusting! Guards! Guards! I
order you to get that out of my sight now! Get them! Get them both!</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: No, no!</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: Shrek!</p>
<p><strong>farquaad</strong>: This hocus-pocus alters nothing. This
marriage is binding, and that makes me king! See? See?</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: No, let go of me! Shrek!</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>farquaad</strong>: Don’t just stand there, you morons.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Get out of my way! Fiona! Arrgh!</p>
<p><strong>farquaad</strong>: I’ll make you regret the day we met. I’ll
see you drawn and quartered! You’ll beg for death to save you!</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: No, Shrek!</p>
<p><strong>farquaad</strong>: And as for you, my wife…</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Fiona!</p>
<p><strong>farquaad</strong>: I’ll have you locked back in that tower
for the rest of your days! I’m king!</p>
<p><strong>farquaad</strong>: I will have order! I will have perfection!
I will have - - show up and the dragon leans down and Aaaah! Aah!</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: All right. Nobody move. I got a dragon here,
and I’m not afraid to use it. I’m a donkey on the edge!</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Celebrity marriages. They never last, do
they?</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Go ahead, Shrek.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Uh, Fiona?</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: Yes, Shrek?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: I - - I love you.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Really, really.</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: I love you too.</p>
<p><strong>congregation</strong>: Aawww!</p>
<p><strong>whispers</strong>: “Until you find true love’s first kiss and
then take love’s true form. Take love’s true form. Take love’s true
form.”</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: Fiona? Fiona. Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>fiona</strong>: Well, yes. But I don’t understand. I’m
supposed to be beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>shrek</strong>: But you ARE beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: I was hoping this would be a happy
ending.</p>
<p><strong>gingerbread man</strong>: God bless us, every one.</p>
<p><strong>donkey</strong>: Oh, that’s funny. Oh. Oh. I can’t breathe. I
can’t breathe.</p>
