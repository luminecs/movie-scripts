<p><strong>supered titles read:</strong>: More of this is true than you
would believe.</p>
<p><strong>2 …close on a man’s face… 2</strong>: He is STARING at us
with fixed concentration. He is sweating slightly in the summer heat. We
hold for a moment. Silence, apart from the soft swish of an unseen
ceiling fan. WIDE SHOT - the Man, wearing military uniform, sits at his
desk in his office, still staring straight ahead. SUPERED TITLES appear,
reading: General Putkin, United States Army Intelligence SED. Arlington,
Virginia. 1983. The General’s assistant, LIEUTENANT BOONE, sits at his
desk, working. After a moment Putkin seems to come to a decision.</p>
<p>****: Boone?</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant boone</strong>: Yes General?</p>
<p><strong>general putkin</strong>: I’m going into the next office.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant boone</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>general putkin</strong>: Damn it!</p>
<p><strong>general putkin</strong>: I have been having ideas, gentlemen.
Challenging ideas. And when I thought about these ideas I thought about
who in the U.S Army would be most receptive to my challenging ideas.</p>
<p>****: Which section of the military is always straining to reach the
peak of their physical and mental capabilities?</p>
<p><strong>general putkin</strong>: You are, gentlemen. Special
Forces.</p>
<p><strong>general putkin</strong>: I want to talk to you about Mind
Wars, gentlemen. War…With…</p>
<p><strong>minds…</strong>: His audience stare at him. With a flourish
he produces a BENT FORK from his briefcase.</p>
<p><strong>general putkin</strong>: How’d you like to be able to do
this? What if you could teach soldiers to do this? Would you be
interested?</p>
<p><strong>general putkin</strong>: Or, or let’s say you have a unit
operating outside the protection of mainline units. What happens if
someone gets hurt? How do you deal with that?</p>
<p><strong>general putkin</strong>: Psychic healing! Protect the unit
with hands-off healing. Using the mind to heal.</p>
<p><strong>general putkin</strong>: Let’s talk about time! What if time
is not a point but a space and at any one instant we can be anywhere in
that space! Physicists go nuts when I say that!</p>
<p><strong>general putkin</strong>: Animals! Stopping the hearts of
animals! This is the idea I’m coming to you with. You have access to
animals right?</p>
<p><strong>major holtz</strong>: No sir. We don’t have access to
animals.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: In 1983, when Special Forces told General
Putkin that they weren’t interested in his ideas…that was a lie.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: And when they told him they didn’t have access
to animals…that was also a lie.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: The hundred goats in the disused hospital
building had been secretly flown in from Central America so as to avoid
customs. Special Forces weren’t worried about the General hearing the
goats because they’d been de- bleated.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: This is the story of those goats.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: My name is Bob Wilton. Imagine me back in
Michigan, where I was born and raised. I studied journalism at Western
in Kalamazoo and then I got a job at the Ann Arbor Daily Telegram. I
wrote a lot of stories about competitive food eating contests.</p>
<p>****: Look at me. So young. “The past is a different country. They…do
things there.”</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: This is Ron.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: He’s the man who died.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: My wife, Debora, told me later that Ron’s death
had been like a wake-up call for her - what people used to call a
memento mori.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: That massive coronary had reminded her that
life was too short to waste any chance of true happiness.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: A week after the funeral she left me for my
editor.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: It seemed like such a tragedy at the time. We
couldn’t see beyond our little lives to the great events of history
unfolding out there in the world.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I was like a child. Or a Hobbit, safe in the
Shire.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Or a blonde farm boy on a distant, desert
planet, unaware that he was already taking the first steps on the path
that will lead him inexorably towards the heart of a conflict between
the forces of Good and Evil.</p>
<p><strong>president bush</strong>: Americans are a resolute people, who
have risen to every test of our time. Adversity has revealed the
character of our country, to the world, and to ourselves…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Had I known where that path would lead, had a
soft wind from my future brought me the name of Bill Django, I might
never have gone. But as it was, I did what so many men have done
throughout history when a woman has broken their heart… I went to
war.</p>
<p><strong>11 titles 11</strong>: As the titles and song continue we see
U.S TV footage from the Iraq War - a dizzying MTV montage, war made pop-
video. Shots include… ““Shock and Awe” air attack on Baghdad Caravans of
U.S troops snaking through the desert Fighter plane video of an Iraqi
fighter jet being destroyed on the ground Oil Wells ablaze</p>
<p><strong>determination</strong>: American troops pull down a huge
statue of Saddam Hussein in central Baghdad. An American flag draped
over the head is hastily replaced by an Iraqi flag.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Yeah, no it’s been…well, I won’t lie to you
Debora - it’s been pretty damn hairy.</p>
<p><strong>debora</strong>: concerned as Bob</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Yeah, it’s not, uh… I’ve seen things that you
shouldn’t, you know…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Pretty damn hairy.</p>
<p><strong>debora</strong>: Well I don’t even know why you’re there.
You’re not exactly war correspondent material are you?</p>
<p>****: Well, I think it’s important people get an accurate picture of
what’s…</p>
<p><strong>debora</strong>: What? Yeah.</p>
<p>****: …what’s, uh, happening, so…is that Dave?</p>
<p><strong>debora</strong>: Yeah. He says Hi.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Oh, that’s, that’s…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Okay. Gotta go. We’re moving out - heading up
north to cover the fighting there…</p>
<p><strong>journalist</strong>: You missed the war?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>second journalist</strong>: How?</p>
<p>****: I’ve been stuck here. They’ve only just given me the
green-light. So I’ll probably head over there soon. I’m just working on
this story about American contractors coming over for the re-build.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Yeah, I think they didn’t want me going over
because I’m not embedded.</p>
<p><strong>second journalist</strong>: Yeah, they don’t like the
unilats. The troops think the unilats’ll stab `em in the back. When
you’re</p>
<p><strong>embedded</strong>: you form a bond with the soldiers. You’re
like one of them.</p>
<p>****: You see action?</p>
<p><strong>second journalist</strong>: Went into Baghdad with Charlie
Company, Second Brigade, Third Infantry Division…</p>
<p><strong>first journalist</strong>: The thunder run? Heard you had it
pretty bad.</p>
<p><strong>second journalist</strong>: Could say that. Technicals all
the way, RPG’s, fuckers were firing anti-aircraft guns at us…</p>
<p><strong>first journalist</strong>: You know a Private First Class
Zuchero?</p>
<p><strong>second man</strong>: Zook? I was standing next to him when he
took a hit…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: So what’s a useful phrase?</p>
<p><strong>kuwait waiter</strong>: La termi, ana sahafi.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What’s that mean?</p>
<p><strong>kuwait waiter</strong>: Don’t shoot, I’m a reporter.</p>
<p>****: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: DeWitt Resources. Arkansas.</p>
<p>****: Right. We make trash cans.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You over here for the conference? Looking for a
contract right?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I guess.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What’s your pitch?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Well…we’re real cheap.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Bob Wilton.</p>
<p>****: Skip.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Could I bum a smoke, Skip?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I sat there watching those reporters and
realized I didn’t want to be me anymore. I wanted to be them. I wanted
to face peril and stand witness to the fall and rise of nations.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Everyone gets everything he wants. Like the man
said. I wanted a mission.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Oh crap, can’t find my…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: And for my sins, Fate brought me one.</p>
<p>****: Lyn Cassady…?</p>
<p><strong>gus lacey</strong>: This is the home learning course we’re
putting out, which is very popular.</p>
<p><strong>gus lacey</strong>: Then there’s the seminars. When I’m not
teaching I spend a lotta time, right here, remote viewing.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Right here?</p>
<p><strong>gus lacey</strong>: The kitchen table. That is correct.
That’s where my body is. But my mind…that’s, you know…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Wandering?</p>
<p><strong>gus lacey</strong>: Wandering. Roaming. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: So what have you seen lately?</p>
<p><strong>gus lacey</strong>: Lately I’ve been watching the Loch Ness
Monster in Scotland, England - which it turns out is the ghost of a
dinosaur. That’s an exclusive for you.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Okay. Wow.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: So…when did this all start for you Gus?</p>
<p><strong>gus lacey</strong>: It started when I was a kid. I used to
lie on my bed and RV my cousin, Irene, undressing at night. Then, when I
was in the army I joined Bill Django’s unit. He trained me and the rest,
as they say…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Right. I don’t know who that is.</p>
<p><strong>gus lacey</strong>: I can’t really talk about Bill.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: So what did you do in the army?</p>
<p><strong>gus lacey</strong>: We were Psychic Spies mainly. That was
our initial tasking but…once they realized what they were sitting on,
the forces at work…</p>
<p><strong>gus lacey</strong>: We were trained to kill animals.</p>
<p>****: You mean, what…with your…?</p>
<p><strong>gus lacey</strong>: With our minds. That is correct. Just by
staring at them.</p>
<p>****: Huh. What kind of animals?</p>
<p><strong>gus lacey</strong>: One of our unit stopped the heart of a
goat.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Wow. I don’t know what to say.</p>
<p><strong>gus lacey</strong>: The power they unlocked in us… Last week
I killed my hamster. You wanna see?</p>
<p><strong>18 back office - later 18</strong>: TV SCREEN - playing a
home video of TWO HAMSTERS in a cage. Bob and Gus sit watching the TV.
Gus’ mother hovers in the background.</p>
<p><strong>gus lacey</strong>: You ever seen a hamster do that
before?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Well, I’ve never owned a hamster Gus, so I
don’t know what…</p>
<p><strong>gus lacey</strong>: Look at the way it’s glaring at its
wheel. Usually that hamster loves its wheel.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Maybe some of the readers have hamsters so…</p>
<p><strong>gus lacey</strong>: Good. Then they’ll know how rare that
is.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Yeah, I guess any hamster-owning readers will
know what’s aberrant behavior and, uh, what’s…Oh, shit, he’s down!</p>
<p><strong>gus lacey</strong>: Yeah, he’s down. At this point I’d been
staring at him for about three hours.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Oh my God! You’ve dropped both hamsters!</p>
<p><strong>gus lacey</strong>: No, the other one’s just fallen over.</p>
<p>****: Bizarre. Right?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Well…it didn’t die. I thought you said you
killed it?</p>
<p>****: Yeah well… Mother said no. She said you might be a
bleeding-heart liberal. She said “Don’t show him the hamster dying. Show
him the tape where the hamster acts bizarre instead.”</p>
<p><strong>gus lacey</strong>: This was nothing. You should have seen
the Skipper at work.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Who’s the Skipper?</p>
<p><strong>gus lacey</strong>: Lyn Cassady. After Bill he was the most
psi-gifted guy I ever met. He was like an Occultic force. I think he
runs a dance studio now.</p>
<p><strong>on lyn’s name tag</strong>: Bob straightens from lighting his
cigarette, stares at Lyn.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Do you…do you know a Gus Lacey?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Lyn? Skip? Lyn?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Whoa!</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: You working for Hooper?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Hooper? No. I work for the Ann Arbor Daily
Telegram.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: How do you know about Lacey?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I interviewed him a few years ago. He’d been
appearing on this radio talk show.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Little prick…what’d he tell you?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: He said he joined Bill Django’s unit in the
army and was trained to, to, uh remote view?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: And he said the Loch Ness Monster was the ghost
of a dinosaur. Who’s Bill Django?</p>
<p>****: Did he show you his “Home Study Course”?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p>****: Yeah I bet he did.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Are you…? Do you mean you corroborate his, uh…?
Because, see, I thought he was just an idiot?</p>
<p>****: He is an idiot…or he was…he’s dead now. He was a paranormal
whore. Always trying to get into the spotlight, yak, yak yaking. We took
an oath. We don’t divulge…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: But you’re saying there was a secret unit?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: We…don’t…divulge.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Okay. Let me ask you something. What
color were the chairs in the hotel bar?</p>
<p>****: Uh…?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: You were in there for hours. What color
were the chairs?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Um…brown?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: They were green. How many lights are
there in this room?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: A Super Soldier wouldn’t need to look.
He would just know.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: A Super Soldier?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: A Jedi Warrior. He would know where all
the lights were. He could walk through a room and tell you how many
power outlets there were. People are walking around with their eyes
closed. At Level One we were trained to instantly absorb all
details.</p>
<p>****: What’s a Jedi Warrior?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: You’re looking at one.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You’re a Jedi Warrior?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: That’s correct.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What does that…? I don’t think</p>
<p>****: I’m Sergeant First Class Lyn Cassady, Special Forces, retired.
In the eighties I was trained at Fort Bragg in a secret initiative
code-named Project Jedi. The objective of the project was to create
Super Soldiers.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Soldiers with Super Powers. We were the
first generation of the New Earth Army.</p>
<p>****: You’ve got super powers?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: That’s correct.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Hold on, let me…let me just…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Okay, so, so you’re saying you were a Psychic
Spy, like Lacey?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: We prefer the term Remote Viewer.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: How does that work?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Different Jedi had different
techniques. Mel Landau used to visualize packing all his cares and
worries in a little suitcase, to clear his mind. Steve Cuttle used to
read Bible verse…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What about you?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Well, I find drinking helps. Also if
I’m listening to classic rock music.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Yeah? Like who?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: I like Boston. Boston usually
works.</p>
<p>****: What other powers did you practise?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Invisibility.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Invisibility?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Yup. That was Level Three.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Actual invisibility?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Well…yeah, that was the goal. But after
a while we adapted it to just finding a way of not being seen. When you
understand the, the linkage between observation and reality, you learn
to dance with invisibility.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Like camouflage?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: It’s not like camouflage. We also
practised Phasing. Crossing from particle to wave, from the physical
realm to the plane of energy. Solid objects seem to pass right through
you. It’s starts with a breathing exercise…</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Then you think black. That’s the
nothingness.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I don’t…can I be honest, Lyn? I don’t know what
to make of this. I don’t know what to say. This is amazing stuff. How
would you…I wanna…could I write a story about this?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Not going to happen.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: No, but see, I’ve been looking for a story Lyn.
I was going to write about the re-build contracts but this…this is even
better and</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Not going to happen.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: All I’m saying is we could talk some more
tomorrow and…</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: I’m shipping out tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You’re going home?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Going to Iraq. There’s this factory we
might be partnering with in Al Qaim.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p>****: I could come.</p>
<p>****: What?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I could come with you, maybe, and…</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Bob, I don’t want to be a story, okay?
I don’t need the attention and…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: No, listen, we could change names, stuff could
stay off record and…</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: It’s a war over there Bob. Okay? A war.
I can’t be looking out for you.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Well you know, you don’t… I look after myself.
Okay? I look after…And I’ve been in some pretty hairy situations before.
I’m not, you know…I’m a journalist, Lyn. You understand?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: A journalist. I go where the story is.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I was an American. I was Resolute. I wanted
adversity to reveal my character to the world. And to my wife. And to
that one-armed cunt Dave.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What? Nothing. I was just doodling.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p>****: Nothing.</p>
<p>****: The U.S Army doesn’t really have any serious alternative than
to be Wonderful!</p>
<p>****: This does not represent the official position of the United
States Army at this time.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: You wanted to know who Bill Django was?
He’s the man who wrote that book.</p>
<p><strong>23 i/e. car - morning 23</strong>: Lyn drives. A hung-over
Bob sits reading the New Earth Army Manual.</p>
<p>****: The New Earth Army is a banner under which the forces of good
can gather. The courage and nobility of the Warrior, blended with the
spirituality of the Monk.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: The Jedi Warrior will follow in the footsteps
of the great Imagineers of the past - Jesus Christ, Lao Tse Tung, Walt
Disney…</p>
<p><strong>25 i/e. car - day 25</strong>: Bob is still reading.</p>
<p>****: The role of The New Earth Army is to RESOLVE CONFLICT
world-wide. Jedis will parachute into war zones, utilizing sparkly eyes

<p><strong>insert</strong>: An illustration of a SOLDIER CARRYING A LAMB
and some LILIES - with what appears to be some kind of loudspeaker
strapped to his shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What’s the sparkly eyes technique?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: You see it?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I think so. Lyn?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Who is this Bill Django?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: I don’t know where to begin.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Bill always said it started for him
when he fell out of a helicopter in Vietnam.</p>
<p><strong>bill django</strong>: Oh, man…</p>
<p><strong>bill django</strong>: Knock-it off! Chris! Knock-it off!</p>
<p><strong>bill django</strong>: Will you knock it off? Jesus. What do
you think…?</p>
<p><strong>silence.</strong>: Everyone stares at the dead man. Another
shot rings out - another SOLDIER DROPS. The others flinch, scan the
tree- line ahead of them.</p>
<p>****: VC in black pyjamas! One hundred meters! It’s a woman!</p>
<p>****: Okay!</p>
<p><strong>bill django</strong>: Well!?</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bill django</strong>: What the fu…! Why isn’t anyone
firing?</p>
<p><strong>take her out!</strong>: The Soldiers open fire - a deafening
roar. The Woman keeps on running as the foliage above her head is
shredded by bullets. NO SHOT COMES CLOSE. Bill watches amazed.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Every single one of Bill’s men fired high. They
instinctively hadn’t wanted to shoot another person. Later Bill would
come across a study by General S.L.A Marshall, which revealed that only
15-20 percent of fresh soldiers shot to kill. The rest aimed high,
didn’t fire at all, or pretended to be busy doing something else.</p>
<p>****: Their gentleness is their strength.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Recovering in hospital, Bill wrote to General
T.L Cornplow, Vice Chief of Staff for the Army, explaining that he
wanted to go on a fact-finding mission to explore alternative combat
tactics. The Pentagon agreed to pay his salary and expenses for the
duration of the journey.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What Bill hadn’t told the Pentagon was that he
was really looking for the answer to the riddle of his vision. How could
his men’s gentleness, their general lack of interest in killing people,
how could this be turned into a strength? How could love and peace help
win wars? Bill knew where to go to find out.</p>

one tub filled with EMBRACING HIPPY MEN. Self-consciously he strokes his
buzz- cut. SUPERED TITLES READ: Naked Hot Tub Encounter Sessions, Santa
Rosa.</p>
<p><strong>miller.</strong>: Bill senses someone staring at him and
glances over to the Meditator next to him - Aviator shades, a baseball
cap pulled low, empty cigarette holder clenched between his teeth. The
Meditator continues to stare intently at him. Then opens his coat to
reveal the Magnum .45 strapped to his chest. Bill smiles nervously. An
ARROW identifies the gunman as</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Bill disappeared into the New Age Movement for
six years.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Like all Shamen before him, he had traversed
the wilderness. Now he was returning to his people, a changed man.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: He brought with him his confidential report -
The New Earth Army Manual.</p>
<p>****: Does it direct your powers?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: The cone. Does it direct your psychic powers or
something?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What does it do?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: It cooks supper.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Solar. Utilizing the power of the
universe - no pollution, totally renewable. This is like New Earth Army
technology.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Pretty mind-blowing, isn’t it? First
time I read it, I was like…what the fuck?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Yes. But…</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Go on - what?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Well it’s just…it’s hard to believe the
Pentagon paid for this. I mean, it’s very interesting, but there’s
nothing in here that’s actually about…fighting?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: The New Earth Army was tasked with
preventing conflict. We’re a force of peace, not war. Bill realized if
you want to change the world, you’ve got to start by changing the
armies. He was the one that started the research into non- lethals.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Non-lethals?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Check this out.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: The Predator.</p>
<p>****: The Predator? That’s a plastic blob, Lyn. That’s a…</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: You see? You’re mine now. The Predator
is completely biodegradable. It’s friendly to the earth but it can hurt
you in a hundred ways.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: It has warrior functions. And it looks
a bit funny. This is New Earth Army technology.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Stop it! Stop hurting me!</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: I bought it on line. What’s cool about
it is that you could see this lying on the ground and you’d never know
it had such lethality.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Eyeballs.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: No!!!!!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I think it’s officially night now.</p>
<p>****: Piece’a shit.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: I’ve got Crohn’s. The steroids
help.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Sometimes there’s a need, Bob.
Sometimes people are calling out for something, even if they don’t know
it themselves. And then a man like Bill appears out of nowhere, because
he heard the call….</p>
<p><strong>bill django</strong>: I’d like us to begin this with a
mantra. If we could all breathe in and then out, holding a long
“eeeeee.”</p>
<p><strong>bill django</strong>: Breathe in… and out…</p>
<p><strong>eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee</strong>: ee.</p>
<p><strong>bill django</strong>: We are a Hollow Army, gentlemen.
Vietnam has crushed our soul. We are traumatized and melancholic. We are
ashamed. That is why I have brought you to this place of Sanctuary. Here
we can mend our wounds and dream our dreams. My dream is of an America
that will lead the world to paradise, an America that no longer has an
exploitative view of natural resources, that no longer promotes
consumption at all costs. I believe this is America’s destiny.</p>
<p><strong>bill django</strong>: But to achieve it we must become the
first Superpower to develop super powers. We must create Warrior Monks -
men and women who can fall in love with everyone, sense plant auras,
pass through walls, stop saying mindless cliches and see into the
future. I want you to JOIN me in this vision. Be ALL you can BE.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Amongst Bill’s audience that night was
Brigadier General Dean Hopgood, from the Defense Intelligence Agency.
For some time the General had been concerned about information he had
been receiving about Soviet research into psychic powers.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: According to some stories the Soviets were
psychically spying on American bases and had designed “psychotronic
generators” - machines capable of bombarding the President with negative
energy.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: They were also conducting sadistic experiments
to see whether animals had psychic powers.</p>
<p><strong>46 another laboratory 46</strong>: Another DIABOLICAL
SCIENTIST is wiring up the KITTENS’</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Could they, for instance, telepathically detect
that their babies were distressed?</p>
<p><strong>47 first laboratory 47</strong>: With a gloating smile one of
the Scientists approaches one of the KITTENS with a lit CIGARETTE. The
kitten gives a pitiful MEW as the Scientists LOOMS over it.</p>
<p><strong>brigadier general hopgood</strong>: Sick bastards…</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: But why did the Soviets begin this type of
research?</p>
<p><strong>brigadier general hopgood</strong>: Well sir, it looks like
they heard about our attempt to telepathically communicate with one of
our nuclear subs - the Nautilus - while it was under the Polar cap.</p>
<p>****: What attempt?</p>
<p><strong>brigadier general hopgood</strong>: There was no attempt,
sir. It seems the story was a French hoax. But the Russians think the
story about the story being a French hoax is just a story sir.</p>
<p><strong>second official</strong>: So, they’ve started psi research
because they thought we were doing psi research, when in fact we weren’t
doing psi research?</p>
<p><strong>brigadier general hopgood</strong>: Yes sir. But now that
they are doing psi research, we’re going to have to do psi research,
sir. We can’t afford to have the Russians leading the field in the
paranormal.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Two weeks later the Army adopted the slogan Be
All You Can Be and appointed Bill Commander of the first New Earth Army
Battalion.</p>
<p>****: Lyn?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Oh God. Oh God.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I didn’t…I thought…What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Salute to the Sun.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Okay. We’re Oscar Mike. That’s “On the
Move” soldier.</p>
<p><strong>53 inside the car 53</strong>: Bob is writing in his notebook
as Lyn drives. He notices Lyn keeps looking up at the sky.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Cloud bursting. Keeps me in shape.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Really? Which one?</p>
<p>****: That one.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: That one?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: No. That one. The big one.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Isn’t that one too far away?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: They’re all far away.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: And it’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Jesus Lyn. You had like the whole desert to
drive in…</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Yeah. I’m sorry about that Bob. Must
have got a little bi- locational there, you know? But don’t worry.
Someone’ll come along soon.</p>
<p><strong>lyn wheaton</strong>: Heads.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>lyn wheaton</strong>: Heads.</p>
<p>****: Right.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What’s your record at this?</p>
<p><strong>lyn wheaton</strong>: Two hundred and sixty four. Tails.</p>
<p>****: Right. That’s pretty…</p>
<p>****: Oh thank Christ.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Can you help us? We drove into a rock. Could
you take us to a town or someplace?</p>
<p>****: Thank you! Thanks so much!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Hi! Hello there. Thanks so much for this.</p>
<p>****: Don’t know if we would have lasted much longer. Phew!</p>
<p>****: Yeah, it gets pretty hot out here, huh?</p>
<p><strong>young iraqi</strong>: Deep Purple.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Oh, you speak English? Great. Deep Purple.
Right. You guys like Deep Purple? You like rock or, or…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Lyn? Is this…is this…?</p>
<p>****: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: We’re going to die! I’m going to be killed by
Al Qaeda!</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: I don’t think they’re Al Qaeda.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Oh what the hell do you know? You don’t know!
You don’t know anything! And this is all your fault!</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Bob, there’s something I have to tell
you. When I said I was retired from the unit, that was a lie. I’m on a
mission. DeWitts was just my cover. I’ve been reactivated. I couldn’t
tell you because this is a Black Op, but…I think you have a part to
play. I think that’s why you’re with me.</p>
<p>****: You’re an idiot. You want to know why I’m with you? Because I
got drunk. I got drunk and I just wanted to get into Iraq so I could
prove to my wife I wasn’t…just once that I…And now I’m going to die.
She’s right. I’m such a…</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Have you heard of Optimum Trajectory
before? Your life is like a river, Bob. If you’re aiming for a goal that
isn’t your destiny, you will always be swimming against the current.
Young Ghandi wants to be a stock-car racer? Not gonna happen. Little
Anne Frank wants to be a High School teacher. Tough titty Anne. That’s
not your destiny. But you will go on to move the hearts and minds of
millions. Find out what your destiny is and the river will carry you.
Now sometimes events in life give an individual clues as to where their
Destiny lies.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Like those doodles you just “happened”
to draw?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: This is the Ajna chakra - the third eye
- the symbol of the Jedi. When I saw you’d drawn it…well, the Universe
gives me a sign like that, I don’t ignore it. You’re meant to be here
with me, Bob. The Jedi inside you sensed that.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Now listen to me. I don’t think these
guys are FRL’s or Mehdi Army… I think we’re talking standard criminals
here, okay? What they’re gonna do is try and sell us on to another
group. We can’t let that happen.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: How are we gonna stop them? There’s three of
them! And they’ve got guns!</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: We’re Jedi, Bob. The Jedi don’t fight
with guns. We fight with our minds.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Let’s say we have no choice but to
fight with these men. Then we use visual aesthetics to instill
psychically in the enemy a disincentive to attack.</p>
<p>****: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Okay, you lock eyes with one of them,
you go into a monotone and you say “No, I’m not going to attack you.”
You totally relax your body and your voice. And then you rip out one of
his eyeballs.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Or you use a pen, stab him in the neck,
create a fountain of blood, I mean really a fountain, get the blood to
squirt on his buddies. That’s a psychic disincentive, right there.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: We haven’t got a pen.</p>
<p>****: You’re missing the point. Here let me show you something. Stand
up.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Choke me.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Oh…I don’t want to Lyn.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Choke me. What am I gonna do? Just
here. Choke. Choke.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I don’t think I…there’s sharp edges around
here…</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: C’mon… “Attack me.”</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What’s with the quotation fingers? That’s like
implying I’m you know…only capable of ironic attacking or…</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Quit jawing, Bob, and choke me.</p>
<p>****: Well, if I choose to choke you, what are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: I’m going to interrupt your thought
pattern.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: See? I hardly moved. Physics wise
there’s not much going on. It’s the psychic energy that’s important. You
okay?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Sharp…edges…</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: You felt fear didn’t you? Before
hand?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Would you say that level of fear was
abnormal for you?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I don’t know. I was pretty terrified anyway but
the fear I felt on the run-up to the choking did seem, you know,
unusual.</p>
<p>****: You know why? It wasn’t you. It was me. I was inside your head.
Fighting with the Mind.</p>
<p><strong>younger iraqi</strong>: Okay. We go.</p>
<p>****: I’m sorry I freaked out, Lyn.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: That’s okay. You learnt a lesson.
“Whatever you fear most has no power - it is your fear that has
power.”</p>
<p>****: Huh.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Oprah.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Uhuh. You really don’t work for DeWitts?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Just my cover.</p>
<p>****: Gus Lacey said you ran a dance studio. That was just cover too,
right?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: No. I do run a dance school. I love
dance.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Oh. Okay. And you’re really on a mission out
here?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: In time, Bob.</p>
<p>****: Were you just kidding me back there - about me having some Jedi
in me?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: We learn to recognize our own kind
after a while. You ever dream about flying?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: That’s one of the signs.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Do you really think so?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Don’t you? Haven’t you always really
felt you were different?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Yes. Yes I have.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: That’s the way it is for us. We’re the
ones who don’t fit in as kids.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Have you always had powers?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Kind of. They used to call me the
Jinx.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Why?</p>
<p>****: Foxtrot-117 has launched. Tracking now. Charlie-Oscar
31.8066667…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: We just lost contact! Request status? Oh
Crap!</p>
<p><strong>brigadier general hopgood</strong>: Did you crash those
computers?</p>
<p>****: Yes sir.</p>
<p>****: Far fucking out…</p>
<p><strong>brigadier general hopgood</strong>: How’d you feel about a
transfer son?</p>
<p><strong>bill django</strong>: I am Lieutenant Colonel Bill Django.
From now on, you will speak only when spoken to, and the first and last
words out of your mouth will be “Sir, yes, sir!” Do you understand?</p>
<p><strong>recruits</strong>: Sir, yes, sir!</p>
<p><strong>bill django</strong>: If you complete this course you will be
a Psychic Weapon, an Angel of Death, our enemies Worst Nightmare! Until
then you are Nothing! Less than Nothing! Do you understand?</p>
<p>****: Yeah, I’m only kidding with that shit. Okay, what shall we do
now?</p>
<p><strong>bill django</strong>: Hey! Lets dance!</p>
<p><strong>bill django</strong>: Okay! Give it everything you’ve got!
That’s it!</p>
<p><strong>bill django</strong>: What’s your name son?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Lyn Cassady sir.</p>
<p><strong>bill django</strong>: Where you from?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Opelousas, Louisiana, sir.</p>
<p><strong>bill django</strong>: Tough place to grow up?</p>
<p><strong>bill django</strong>: You’ve gotta free your feet before you
can free your mind, Lyn.</p>
<p>****: Not much of a dancer sir.</p>
<p><strong>bill django</strong>: But that isn’t true is it Lyn? You can
dance. It’s just someone told you not to.</p>
<p><strong>63 bedroom - 1965 63</strong>: A TWELVE YEAR OLD LYN - is
dancing away to a track on the radio. His FATHER weaves drunkenly past
the door and stops, watching.</p>
<p><strong>lyn’s father</strong>: Stop acting so fucking QUEER!</p>
<p><strong>bill django</strong>: Well, I’m your commanding officer Lyn,
and I’m ordering you to let the dance out!</p>
<p><strong>bill django</strong>: C’mon goddamit! DANCE! Let it go! Let
it all go!</p>
<p><strong>bill django</strong>: Welcome to the Heroes Journey Lyn.</p>
<p><strong>bill django</strong>: Okay remember everyone, we don’t
officially exist as a unit so I’m afraid there’s no coffee budget. Bring
your own coffee. Oh, and no solid food for the first week.</p>
<p><strong>special forces troops</strong>: “I don’t know but I’ve been
told Eskimo Pussy is mighty cold…”</p>
<p><strong>jedi warriors</strong>: Ommmm…</p>
<p>****: Okay, you’re doing very well. Now feel the next bend…</p>
<p><strong>bill django</strong>: Okay, only when you’re ready.</p>
<p>****: Think cold! Think real cold!</p>
<p><strong>jedis</strong>: Mother Earth, my life support system as a
soldier, I must drink your blue water. I pray my boots will always kiss
your face and my footsteps match your heartbeat. I am yours and you are
mine. I salute you.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: After years of feeling like an oddball Lyn had
finally found a home. At last he was amongst men who prided themselves
on being different.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: These were Golden Days for Lyn. There was
something so noble and pure in Bill’s vision that the Jedis felt
themselves inspired to be more than soldiers. In a world torn apart by
greed and hate they would be a force for good, for peace.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: For the first time in his life Lyn felt truly
happy.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Then into the garden a serpent did come.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Larry Hooper was a failed Sci-Fi writer from
Colorado, recruited to the Jedis after Brigadier General Hopgood met him
at a spoon-bending party.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Right from the start he had made himself
unpopular with the other Jedis.</p>
<p><strong>larry hooper</strong>: Congratulations Scotty. I’m sorry it
doesn’t work out for you two.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Larry made it quite clear that he despised most
of the other Jedis.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: But Lyn - Lyn was different. He really hated
Lyn.</p>
<p><strong>a-9.</strong>: The three men focus on the cupboard in
question.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: It’s…it’s something cylindrical? I think
it’s a pencil?</p>
<p><strong>bill django</strong>: Okay. Larry?</p>
<p><strong>larry hooper</strong>: This is Larry’s Spirit Guide, Maud.
I’m looking into the cupboard now and I’m seeing…I’m seeing…a tin
mug?</p>
<p><strong>bill django</strong>: Lyn?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: It’s a man on a chair.</p>
<p>****: Oh, no, wait. See, I thought you said K, not A!</p>
<p><strong>bill django</strong>: Bravo Zulu, Lyn. Outstanding.</p>
<p><strong>bill django</strong>: Aikido is a vehicle for harmonizing
ourselves with the Universe and the Way. Look upon these sessions as an
opportunity to discover yourself and your training partner in a loving
environment.</p>
<p><strong>later</strong>: Larry flails violently at Lyn. Lyn FLIPS him
with ease. Larry gets up and CHARGES bellowing at Lyn who FLIPS him out
of the frame. Bill joins Lyn.</p>
<p><strong>bill django</strong>: Notice how Lyn’s circular motions
turned Larry’s aggression back upon him. Good work Lyn.</p>
<p>****: Larry, go outside, calm down.</p>
<p><strong>85 continued: 85</strong>: Lyn opens the envelope and stares
at the PHOTOGRAPH of the NATO GENERAL inside.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: After a year’s training, Lyn was given his
first tasking. A senior Nato General had been kidnapped by Red Brigade
members in Italy. Bill was unofficially asked if his unit would be able
to help find him before it was too late.</p>
<p>****: We’re north of Verona. It’s a little town. There’s a lake
nearby. I can see a Cinema. Across from the Cinema is a shop or, or…it’s
a cafe. He’s in the apartment above. The town is called…it’s something
sweet. Dolce. It’s called Dolce.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: It’s true that the unit never found out whether
any of their remote viewings were accurate or not. Nevertheless from
that moment on Lyn’s reputation soared.</p>
<p><strong>bill django</strong>: Rank, medals…these things mean little
to the Jedi. But growth in spirit, in wisdom, in psychic power, these
things earn our respect.</p>
<p><strong>bill django</strong>: Native Americans believed that when one
received an Eagle feather, it was the mark of love, of gratitude and
ultimate respect. Only true Human Beings may carry the Eagle
feather.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: The word soon got out in the intelligence
community that there was a sergeant at Fort Bragg who could find
whatever you needed found. It was as if Lyn could fly anywhere in the
world without leaving his room.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: As Bill Django said - the Force truly was
strong with this one.</p>
<p><strong>89 the sun - rising - the present 89</strong>: …as the
Pick-up with Bob and Lyn in the back pulls up next to another TRUCK. Two
MEN dressed in black with their kaffiyeh covering their faces stand by
it staring at them. In the back seat of the Truck sits a blindfolded
IRAQI MAN. The Driver of the Pick-Up crosses to the TWO INSURGENTS with
a half-gallon bottle of WATER and passes it to them. They drink and
confer briefly in Arabic. He turns and gestures to the other two Young
Iraqis who push Lyn and Bob down from the back of the pick-up. Lyn
stands still.</p>
<p><strong>young iraqi</strong>: Etaharrak!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Lyn?</p>
<p>****: It’s okay, Bob. We’re not getting into that truck.</p>
<p><strong>young iraqi</strong>: Edkhol!</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Don’t move Bob.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Are you going to use the Blob?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Let’s hope it doesn’t come to that.</p>
<p><strong>edkhol!</strong>: Lyn raises one hand towards him.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: You can put your weapon away. You’re
not interested in us.</p>
<p>****: Stay where you are Bob.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Shit…shit…</p>
<p>****: We can go about our business.</p>
<p>****: La termi, ana sahafi!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Now at the time I thought Lyn was having some
kind of fit here. Later I discovered what he was actually doing was
performing the Echmeyer technique.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Ben Echmeyer was a Vietnam vet with sixty-three
confirmed kills. He remains the only non-Korean to achieve the rank of
Master in Kwa Ra Do. He was one of the Jedi teachers at Fort Bragg.</p>
<p><strong>reverse</strong>: SHOOTING from behind Ben to the rows of
JEDI RECRUITS watching with expressions of mingled admiration and
horror.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: It was said he could have a tug of war with a
dozen men and not move an inch.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: He was also able to lift bags of sand on hooks
hung through his scrotum.</p>
<p><strong>jedi recruit</strong>: Sir, what’s the practical application
of this?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Another demonstration involved letting a
recruit drive a jeep over him. This, in the end, was to be his
undoing.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Before his untimely death Ben caused quite a
stir by advocating his controversial “shock and awe” knife attack
method.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: The approach was hailed by some knife
aficionados as revolutionary but criticized by others who believed that
the leaping and spinning might lead you to accidentally stab
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Lyn Cassady, however, became a firm convert to
the style.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Ben, you’re not forgotten. The knife
you gave me lies next to my beret. God bless Ben Echmeyer.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Of course, Lyn didn’t actually have a knife
with him at this particular time…so I still think what he did was
kinda…reckless.</p>
<p><strong>inside the truck</strong>: Lyn drives. Bob is leaning out of
the window, staring at the road behind them.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: They’re not coming! We’re okay! Oh God, we’re
gonna be okay!</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: There he is.</p>
<p>****: Sir? You’re okay! We’re Americans. We’re here to help you!</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Oh crap!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p>****: I think I just ran him over.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Sir? Are you okay? Bob, give me a hand
here will you?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Oh shit! Oh shit, they’re coming!</p>
<p><strong>laptop screen</strong>: We’re rushing over a CGI DESERT,
between the CGI rivers Tigress and Euphrates towards a GLEAMING CITY
rising from the sand.</p>
<p><strong>nixon</strong>: Then I say “There it is. The Future!”</p>
<p><strong>nixon</strong>: We play this on these big screens at the
conferences, you know? This trumpet music blasting out. Every time I see
it, it gets me.</p>
<p><strong>nixon</strong>: You a businessman, sir?</p>
<p><strong>nixon</strong>: Yeah, Ali Babas have been targeting locals
lately. Todd Nixon, Army Small Business Office.</p>
<p>****: Mahmud Daash.</p>
<p><strong>nixon</strong>: Ask me what business I’m in, Muhammad.</p>
<p>****: Mahmud. What business are you in sir?</p>
<p><strong>nixon</strong>: Right now, I’m in the Quality of Life
business.</p>
<p><strong>nixon</strong>: We’ve got 25 million Iraqis out here who
wanna be independent, wanna make something of their lives. But more than
anything else they wanna buy stuff. Cell phones, digital cameras,
leisure suits - you name it. If it sells in Boston, then we can damn
well sell it in Baghdad! Am I right Muhammad? He knows what I’m talking
about. We’ve got Halliburton, Parsons, Perini…just in the primes. We’re
gonna have Macdonalds, we’re gonna have Starbucks…No corporate tax. It’s
a gold-rush. Oh, and by the way, fuck the French! Did you hear that
shit? Chirac wants to bring French contractors in? Can you believe that?
Hey, Phil? Raise one hand if you like the French.</p>
<p><strong>the driver</strong>: Raise both your hands if you are
French!</p>
<p>****: Yeah, okay…watch the wheel Phil. Year Zero boys.</p>
<p><strong>the back seat</strong>: Lyn prepares an INJECTION for
himself. He feels the Security Guard beside him watching. He notices the
name of the company on the man’s badge - Krom Security.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: What’s Krom?</p>
<p><strong>security man</strong>: God of War.</p>
<p>****: Really? Is that Norse?</p>
<p><strong>security man</strong>: Conan the Barbarian. S’in the
movie.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Right.</p>
<p>****: Okay. We’re in Indian Country. Check six.</p>
<p><strong>nixon</strong>: I was pretty down for a while about not
getting any trigger time in this war Bob, but you know what I’ve learnt?
Our greatest weapon against evil is commerce. When these people have
quality consumer items they will no longer want to kill Americans.</p>
<p><strong>nixon</strong>: We’re not gonna rest until there’s a
satellite dish on every one of</p>
<p><strong>those</strong>: roofs.</p>
<p><strong>98 inside the suv 98</strong>: The driver of the first SUV
radios Nixon’s car.</p>
<p><strong>first driver</strong>: We’ve got a line for the gas station
here. Are we waiting?</p>
<p><strong>nixon’s driver</strong>: Negative. We’d be way too exposed.
We’re taking the station. Go in fangs out.</p>
<p><strong>texan security man</strong>: Secure the perimeter!</p>
<p><strong>texan security man</strong>: Give her the go-juice, Eddy!</p>
<p><strong>chilean security man</strong>: I filled her up last time.</p>
<p><strong>texan security man</strong>: Bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>nixon</strong>: He did fill her up last time Gary.</p>
<p><strong>texan security man</strong>: With respect sir, bull-fucking-
shit. I tanked her last time.</p>
<p><strong>third security man</strong>: Every time! Can we get some sort
of fucking system so we don’t…</p>
<p>****: Contact! We’ve got contact!</p>
<p>****: Where? Where’s the shooter?</p>
<p><strong>100 across the street 100</strong>: Another SUV - identical,
but black, is passing, hemmed in by traffic. A stray BULLET from the
gas-station pings off it’s armor plating. Immediately it screeches to a
halt and a NEW DETACHMENT OF SECURITY MEN roll from the car - same
flak-jackets and Oakley sunglasses but different color uniforms.</p>
<p><strong>new security man</strong>: Contact! We’re under fire!</p>
<p><strong>101 gas station 101</strong>: …as bullets smack off the
parked SUV.</p>
<p><strong>third security man</strong>: Two o’clock! Two o’clock!</p>
<p><strong>inside the suv</strong>: A scowling Nixon has slid low in his
seat.</p>
<p><strong>nixon</strong>: Trying to help you fucking savages.</p>
<p><strong>mahmud daash</strong>: My house is not far. We could walk
from here.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Sounds good Muhammad.</p>
<p><strong>mahmud daash</strong>: Mahmud.</p>
<p><strong>102 gas station 102</strong>: As machine-gun fire from across
the street strafes the station and Nixon’s Security men return fire
blindly.</p>
<p><strong>first security man</strong>: Krom One this is Freedom
Frontier. We are under attack. This is a FUBAR situation. Requesting
Kiowa!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Muhammad led us to his home which it turned out
had been robbed in his absence.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: And also accidentally set on fire by a US tank.
Neighbors told him his wife had left, they weren’t sure where she had
gone.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p><strong>mahmud daash</strong>: Taameeyah.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: They’re really good.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I understood he was going through a lot, but
considering we had saved him from kidnappers I still thought his welcome
could have been a little warmer.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: I’m very sorry for running you over,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>mahmud daash</strong>: It was an accident.</p>
<p>****: And I apologize for that security detachment. Please don’t
think all Americans are like that.</p>
<p><strong>mahmud daash</strong>: I apologize for the kidnappers.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Not your fault sir. I mean we get
kidnappers in America too, so…you know. There’s always, uh, bad apples,
right?</p>
<p>****: Akhir il ahzan.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Did I say it wrong?</p>
<p><strong>mahmud daash</strong>: No…that was right.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Lyn?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What are you thinking?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Just Mahmud. People try to build
something of their lives, something lasting, something good… but there’s
always someone wants to smash it up…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Lyn was thinking of Larry Hooper and the part
he had played in the destruction of the New earth Army. But, in
fairness, the Jedis’ own eccentricities hadn’t exactly won them many
allies in the Army.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: For example, there was Tim Kootz who, on being
asked to ascertain the whereabouts of General Manuel Noriega, had
replied…</p>
<p>****: Ask Angela Lansbury.</p>
<p>****: What’s that Tim?</p>
<p><strong>tim kootz</strong>: Ask Angela Lansbury.</p>
<p><strong>cia agent</strong>: We asked Angela Lansbury.</p>
<p><strong>bill django</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>cia agent</strong>: She said she didn’t know where General
Noriega was.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Or there was the time Major General Gilling was
visiting the base and saw Jedi trainee Clifford Hickox…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: …practising the ancient Sun Dance of the Sioux
Nation.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: The Jedis survived such minor scandals,
protected, it was rumored, by a President who was a fan of both the Star
Wars films and the paranormal himself. But then, one summer, a young,
likeable Lieutenant called Norman Pendleton was recruited to the New
Earth Army…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Larry Hooper wasted no time befriending the
newcomer. Desperate to compete with Lyn, Larry had been doing research
into the infamous CIA MK-ULTRA experiments which he believed could
enhance his own psychic powers.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: All he needed was a lab rat to try them out on,
check if they were safe.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: It turned out they weren’t.</p>
<p><strong>114 close on larry - later 114</strong>: …cowering terrified
under the couch, as the sound of GUNSHOTS fill the room. Norm’s NAKED
LEGS stride past him.</p>
<p>****: Norm? Give me the gun, Norm.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Norm’s father, who it turned out was pretty
high up in the Pentagon, wanted blood.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Although the Jedis were pretty sure Larry was
responsible, nothing could be proved and when he was called to the
disciplinary hearing Larry made sure to smear Bill with everything he
could…</p>
<p><strong>117 larry talking before the hearing 117</strong>: …looking
every inch the neat, professional soldier.</p>
<p><strong>larry hooper</strong>: Lieutenant Colonel Django used funds
from the project’s black budget to procure prostitutes…</p>
<p><strong>bill django</strong>: That’s a lie!</p>
<p><strong>larry hooper</strong>: …and also drugs for himself and his
men.</p>
<p><strong>bill django</strong>: That’s a… Well the hooker thing is
definitely a lie!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Brigadier General Hopgood resigned and died
some years later. Bill received a dishonorable discharge.</p>
<p><strong>bill django</strong>: Continue the work, Lyn. The World needs
the Jedis, now more than ever.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: After Bill left, Major Holtz of Special Forces
took command of the Jedis.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: And nothing was ever the same again.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: I really appreciate this sir.</p>
<p><strong>126 inside the car 126</strong>: Lyn sits staring out at the
emptiness, looking, perhaps for the first time, worried.</p>
<p>****: Jesus Christ. We could’a bought a map if you’d said.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Bedouins have been navigating this
desert for centuries without maps. You can use a wrist-watch in
conjunction with the sun.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: What?</p>
<p>****: Well…use your watch.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: I haven’t got a watch.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Oh for the love of…Here…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: This is a digital watch, Bob.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: So? That’s…</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: So you need a watch with hands for
Christ’s sake!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Well how the hell am I supposed to know?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You’re the navigation expert here. You told me
you could find the way.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Will, if you’d just be quiet for a…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Turns out you haven’t even got a watch! Now
what the hell are we…</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Will you shut up? I don’t need a watch.
I’m using Level Two.</p>
<p>****: What?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Level Two. Intuition. We were trained
to make correct decisions. Somebody runs up to you and says “There’s a
fork in the road. Do we turn left or do we turn right? And you go…”We go
right!”</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Just…instant?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Instant. Just like that.</p>
<p><strong>an hour! how’s that “instant?”</strong>: Lyn abruptly starts
the engine and takes the right turn.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Oh, it’s that way?</p>
<p>****: Yes. It’s this way.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Right. Now you know.</p>
<p>****: What…what happened?</p>
<p>****: What?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Improvised Explosive Device.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Oh Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: You’re okay Bob. It’s gonna be
okay.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I can’t believe this. Great fucking intuition
Lyn. I can’t…put me down. I can walk. Put me down.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Oh, Jeez. Oh, Jeez.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Alright, c’mon…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Where are we going? We should stay with the car
so the army can find us.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Fedayeen will find us first.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Well, I disagree. I totally disagree. The
Federal what?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Fedayeen Saddam. Paramilitary. Fellas
who probably laid the IED. They could be on their way now. Hold this
Bob.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Could be IED’s or mines around here.
I’m checking for disturbances in the telluric current.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Are they my glasses?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Jesus, it’s hot. I’m so hot. Aren’t you
hot?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Bob? It’s pretty important you keep
your mouth closed, okay? You can lose a lot of water through an open
mouth.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I can’t breathe properly. I can’t…Oh boy…</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: You’re okay.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I think I’m bleeding to death.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: You’re not bleeding to death, Bob. It’s
shock, okay? It’s just the shock. It’ll pass. You’re gonna be okay.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: If we’d stayed at the road we would be safe
now! Now we’ve got no water, no food or, or… Will you forget about the
fucking tantric currents?</p>
<p>****: You’re going to be okay.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Stop saying that! I just got blown up! I’m in
the middle of a desert!</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Bob, you’re suffering from shock. If
you start panicking now your heart’s gonna stop.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Is that…is that supposed to calm me down?! You
know what color the seats were in the frigging hotel but you can’t…you
wanna observe something Lyn? Observe the fucking bomb in the middle of
the road!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Wait a minute. That’s west. Al Qaim’s in that
direction. We’re going the wrong way.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: The mission isn’t in Al Qaim. It’s
somewhere near Al Qaim.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Where?</p>
<p>****: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Is that…is that…is that a joke? We’ve come six
hundred miles and you don’t know where we’re going?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: If the exact whereabouts of the Target
was known it wouldn’t take a Jedi to find them, would it?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Who gave you the mission Lyn? Lyn?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Bill did.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Bill did. He appeared in my trailer two
months ago. A psychic projection. I could hear him calling my name.</p>
<p>****: Oh…Oh Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: He needed me.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus Lyn. There’s no mission?
We’re in the middle of the desert because you heard voices? There’s no
one here! There’s no-one fucking here.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Lyn!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Is it the Crohns?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: I don’t have Crohns.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What’s the matter with you?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: I’m dying.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: I’ve been murdered.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: It’s gone Bob. I can’t find him. I’ve
lost my power. It’s the curse.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What curse?</p>
<p>****: They took this… beautiful thing we’d been building and they
corrupted it. They destroyed the New Earth Army.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Who destroyed it?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: I did.</p>
<p><strong>major holtz</strong>: Yoga is not the business of the US
Army, ladies. Drumming circles are not the business of the Army. And
love and peace is most certainly not the business of the Army. So you
girls better start thinking about how you CAN engage in the business of
the United States Army, which, in case you have forgotten, involves
winning fucking wars!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: When the dust of the Pendleton Affair had
settled it revealed a surprising victor.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Major Holtz regarded Larry Hooper as a
patriotic whistle-blower and the one sound fruit in an otherwise dubious
barrel of apples.</p>
<p><strong>larry hooper</strong>: It’s some scientific research I’ve
done for possible offensive psi applications sir. I did show the report
to Lieutenant Colonel Django, but he didn’t seem interested.</p>
<p>****: I bet he wasn’t.</p>
<p><strong>major holtz</strong>: We have men who can do this?</p>
<p><strong>larry hooper</strong>: I think I know one sir.</p>
<p><strong>major holtz</strong>: But we don’t have the resources.</p>
<p><strong>larry hooper</strong>: Well sir…there is goat lab?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Goat Lab was originally created as a
clandestine laboratory to provide in-the-field surgical training for
Special Forces soldiers.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: The goats would get shot in the leg with a bolt
gun and then a trainee would have to dress the wound successfully. Goat
lab actually used to be called Dog Lab…</p>
<p><strong>134 small dog staring at us 134</strong>: …with big, brown
eyes.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: But it turned out most soldiers didn’t feel
good shooting dogs in the leg…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: …whereas the army had long felt fine about
doing stuff to goats - even testing atomic weapons on them.</p>
<p>****: Holy shit.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: This was the real deal, Bob. I was at
the Gateway. Afterwards I realized I’d got injured.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Sympathetic injury I guess. I was
bruised all over.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: So, it’s not that the goat fought back?</p>
<p>****: Goat didn’t have a chance.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: But…that was it?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: I wish it was. Hooper told Holtz we
should try the experiment again. Only this time they said…kill the
goat.</p>
<p><strong>major holtz</strong>: Take out number four.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Lyn said he had no intention of killing the
goat.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: There was no way! What had the goat
ever done to me? It was totally against the way of the Jedi. I was just
going to pretend to try so they would say, “okay - it can’t be done” and
forget about it. But then, as I sat there, I felt this, this pulse start
inside of me and…I couldn’t stop it.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: You know what I keep thinking?</p>
<p><strong>close on lyn</strong>: …as he stares, concentrating.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Maybe deep down inside some dark part
of me wanted to see if I could do it?</p>
<p><strong>video footage</strong>: Grainy, flickering black and white
footage of the six goats in the room. Suddenly one of them goes
down.</p>
<p>****: The goat is dead.</p>
<p>****: Goat number four?</p>
<p>****: No. Number five.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Collateral damage?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Collateral damage. That was it. I’d
used my powers for evil and it was like I brought a curse upon us all.
Like that poem where the guy kills the seagull and they make him wear it
round his neck. Every night I’d dream of that goat in its little bib,
it’s mouth opening and closing but nothing coming out…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: The silence of the goats.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: I finished my tour and I quit. I walked
out of the unit and I never went back.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: But before he could leave Larry arranged one
last parting gift.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: What do you wan…?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: What the hell?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: It was the Dim Mak.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: The Dim Mak?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: The Dim Mak. The Quivering Palm. The
Death Touch. It’s like this legendary, martial arts move. It was
forbidden in the New Earth Army. Larry had got it from a mail- order
book.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What does the Death Touch do?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: It kills you Bob. With one touch.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: There’s a story that Wong Wifu, great
Chinese martial artist, had a fight with some guy and had him beat when
the guy gave him this light tap, and Wong looked at him and the guy just
nodded. That was it. He’d given him the death touch and Wong died.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Then and there?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: No. Eighteen years later. That’s the
weird thing with Dim Mak - you never know when it’s going to take
effect.</p>
<p><strong>fade out.</strong>: In the BLACK we hear a VOICE.</p>
<p>****: In America if I do not like my cell-phone company I change
them. I am in charge. This is consumer power.</p>
<p><strong>army broadcaster</strong>: This is democracy. Let us work
together for that. And please stop shooting at those who are only here
to help.</p>
<p><strong>army broadcaster</strong>: This is an old one from Cat
Stevens. Yusef Islam. That’s Yusef Islam.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Lyn?</p>
<p>****: Lyn? Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>152 another corridor - moments later 152</strong>: Lyn passes
doors, glances into the rooms beyond… LYN’S P.O.V - the room seems to
house a PRINTING PRESS. A SOLDIER stands with his back to us, watching
LEAFLETS fire out of the press. We pass to the next room which seems to
be a RECORDING STUDIO - the walls covered in shelves of CD’s. A SOLDIER
sits with headphones on playing an electronic keyboard…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Lyn!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I don’t think we should…</p>
<p><strong>inside the building</strong>: The place is full of GOATS. Lyn
and Bob stare at the animals. Slowly Lyn advances into the darkness,
peering around him. In the shadows at the back of the building a figure
STIRS. Lyn walks slowly forward until he can make out the man - old,
bearded, worn and wasted by years of heavy drinking. It’s BILL DJANGO.
Lyn stares at him.</p>
<p>****: Hello Bill.</p>
<p><strong>bill django</strong>: Hello Lyn.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: This is Bob.</p>
<p><strong>bill django</strong>: Hello Bob.</p>
<p><strong>larry hooper</strong>: Oh good…</p>
<p><strong>larry hooper</strong>: …the gang’s all here.</p>
<p><strong>larry hooper</strong>: This is primarily a Psyops base.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Psy for psychic?</p>
<p>****: Psy for psychological, although the irony isn’t wasted on me.
Radio broadcasts, leaflets, that sort of thing.</p>
<p><strong>larry hooper</strong>: Oh, that’s an Iraqi Psyops leaflet
they dropped on us.</p>
<p>****: “American Soldier - your wives are back home having sex with
Bart Simpson and Bert Reynolds.”</p>
<p><strong>larry hooper</strong>: Yeah, hadn’t exactly done their
homework there.</p>
<p><strong>larry hooper</strong>: How’d you find us, Lyn?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: I remote viewed you.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: If this is Psyops what are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>larry hooper</strong>: I said primarily Psyops. This is a
restricted area, you understand? Everything you hear and see stays
secret or you go to prison.</p>
<p><strong>larry hooper</strong>: There are individuals in the current
administration who are looking for…creative solutions for the War on
Terror.</p>
<p><strong>larry hooper</strong>: They’re far more open minded then
their predecessors, and they’ve out-sourced experimental research to my
company.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: “Sick?”</p>
<p><strong>larry hooper</strong>: It’s pronounced psi-ike. Psychic
Systems International Corp. Turns out certain people had heard about the
New Earth Army and were interested in some of the work we were doing
back then. They got in touch with me, I got in touch with Bill.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: You’re working for him?</p>
<p><strong>larry hooper</strong>: Bill’s been looking into subliminal
messaging. This is one we’ve designed to play to our own troops before
combat.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: There’s a subliminal message in this?</p>
<p><strong>larry hooper</strong>: This is…“Don’t get drunk before firing
heavy machine guns.” We’ve got all sort of products in development. Tell
them one of our new ideas.</p>
<p><strong>psic worker</strong>: Air bag mine?</p>
<p><strong>larry hooper</strong>: Air bag mine. Non-lethal mine,
catapults the fucker up into air. Gimme another one.</p>
<p><strong>2nd psic worker</strong>: Blast target with pheromones and
then release Attack Bees.</p>
<p><strong>larry hooper</strong>: Excellent. Attack Bees. The Forces of
Nature! Another.</p>
<p><strong>1st psic worker</strong>: Project Achilles. We mutilate enemy
corpses and…</p>
<p><strong>larry hooper</strong>: We’re not doing that anymore!
Idiot!</p>
<p><strong>larry hooper</strong>: The point is we’ve got a budget, we’ve
got supporters. I’m rebuilding the New Earth Army. Only this time
without the hippy crap.</p>
<p><strong>larry hooper</strong>: You okay Bill?</p>
<p><strong>bill django</strong>: Gonna get some ice-cream.</p>
<p><strong>larry hooper</strong>: You get the odd flash of what he used
to be but… he’s pretty burnt out with the booze.</p>
<p><strong>larry hooper</strong>: Ooo, Twizzlers.</p>
<p><strong>larry hooper</strong>: You want one?</p>
<p><strong>larry hooper</strong>: God, I love these things…</p>
<p><strong>lyn’s p.o.v -</strong>: An IRAQI PRISONER sits huddled in the
cell, illuminated in the flashes of a powerful STROBE LIGHT
OVERHEAD.</p>
<p><strong>song</strong>: The prisoner looks terrified, and despite the
whimsical music the whole scene is horribly sinister. Lyn steps away
from the spy-hole.</p>
<p>****: What? What is it?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: It’s the Dark Side.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Lyn? What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: It’s too late…I’m dying, Bob.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Oh, you’re not dying! I don’t believe you can
kill someone with a mail order Dim Sum. You can’t…</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Dim Mak.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Whatever. I don’t believe you can just…</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: It’s cancer.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: …just tap someone and …it… What?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: I mean, I know it was caused by the Dim
Mak. But…it’s…you know…it’s cancer. That’s what the doctors say.
Different ways of looking at…different names for a reality or, or
uh…</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: I shouldn’t have come Bob. Shouldn’t
have come.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: …Give this back to Bill…I don’t deserve
it.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I think you should go and see Lyn, sir. he
needs you.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: The man crossed a desert to see you again.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You know, he told me all these stories about
Bill Django, and I was pretty excited to meet you, but I’ve gotta tell
you…you’re one big disappointment.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: He told me to give you that back. I don’t know
why. Its supposed to be a mark of honour isn’t it? I don’t see how you
deserve that.</p>
<p>****: It isn’t real.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What isn’t?</p>
<p><strong>bill django</strong>: The feather. Twenty thousand dollar
fine for taking an eagle feather. This one’s off a turkey. You just die
the tip black. Don’t tell Lyn.</p>
<p><strong>bill django</strong>: None of it was real.</p>
<p>****: That isn’t true. That isn’t true.</p>
<p><strong>larry hooper</strong>: Oh. Didn’t mean to wake you.</p>
<p><strong>larry hooper</strong>: Heard you weren’t feeling well?</p>
<p>****: Just tired.</p>
<p><strong>larry hooper</strong>: How’d you find us?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: I told you. I remote viewed you.</p>
<p>****: Scotty Mercer told you, didn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>larry hooper</strong>: Yeah, he did. We told Scotty we were
coming over here, asked him if he wanted some work.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: I haven’t seen Scotty.</p>
<p><strong>larry hooper</strong>: That’s funny, because he told me he’d
run into you and mentioned that there might be some jobs going with us
over here. Isn’t that why you came, really, Lyn? You want back in, don’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>larry hooper</strong>: It can happen. You’ve only got to say
the word. Could be the new Golden Age for Psi research.</p>
<p><strong>larry hooper</strong>: You, me and Bill, back together again.
Just like the old days.</p>
<p><strong>larry hooper</strong>: Mother Earth, my life support system.
As a soldier I must drink your blue water, live inside your red clay and
eat your green skin.</p>
<p><strong>larry hooper</strong>: I pray my boots will always kiss your
face and my footsteps match your heartbeat.</p>
<p><strong>larry and lyn</strong>: Carry my body through space and time.
You are my connection to the Universe…</p>
<p><strong>larry and lyn</strong>: …and all that comes after. I am yours
and you are mine.</p>
<p><strong>larry and lyn</strong>: I salute you.</p>
<p>****: Don’t make a decision now. Tell me in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Bill? Bill are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>bill django</strong>: I just saw Timothy Leary.</p>
<p>****: Timothy Leary’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>bill django</strong>: I know. He’s had an idea.</p>
<p>****: Good evening sir.</p>
<p>****: Getting some ice-cream.</p>
<p>****: Don’t eat the jello.</p>
<p>****: What?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Don’t eat the jello.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: We put LSD in the jello.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Bill showed me where Larry had bottles of LSD.
So we put it in the jello mix last night.</p>
<p>****: And in the water.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bill django</strong>: I put it in the main water tank as
well.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: But…we’ve drunk the water.</p>
<p>****: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>army broadcaster</strong>: The weather? The weather is going
to be HOT!</p>
<p><strong>army broadcaster</strong>: I’m guessing. I mean, I haven’t
looked at the, the thing but I’d say it’s going to be fucking HOT! Hot.
Hot. Hot.</p>
<p><strong>army broadcaster</strong>: That hurt Greg, you fucking dip-
shit. You fuckity fuck dip-shit fuck-hole. Hey! Music!</p>
<p><strong>all over the base</strong>: Soldiers are wandering around,
talking, some falling to their knees, weak with laughter. Some stand
alone, staring with a beatific smile at the sky.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: You’re going to hit the gates. You’re going
to hit the gates.</p>
<p>****: It’s okay. You missed them.</p>
<p>****: Don’t you think it might have been more sensible if we hadn’t
drunk the fucking water?</p>
<p><strong>bill django</strong>: That might have aroused suspicion. But
don’t worry. Over the years I have built up a massive tolerance to all
narcotics.</p>
<p><strong>bill django</strong>: In the name of the New Earth Army and
loving people everywhere I’m liberating this base!</p>
<p>****: Give me the gun Larry.</p>
<p><strong>larry hooper</strong>: Wow. I’m hungry.</p>
<p>****: Hey! More music! Get off, will ya?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: Okay, let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>174 flattened section of fence 174</strong>: Bob and Lyn
stand at one side, Bill at the other, beckoning the prisoners through,
hugging the prisoners as they pass through.</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: We’re very sorry. Ma’assalama.</p>
<p>****: That’s it. Keep going. Ma’assalama.</p>
<p><strong>176 helicopter 176</strong>: Bill and Lyn sit in the chopper,
Bill at the controls. Lyn is holding the flowers. Bob appears, hurrying
over.</p>
<p>****: Wait! Wait for me! Where are you going…what about the
mission?</p>
<p><strong>lyn cassady</strong>: You are the mission Bob! You are the
mission! Tell them what happened!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: At the time I was hurt that Lyn hadn’t taken me
with him. But now I know it was because he and Bill had already seen
what was to come.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Nobody knows exactly what happened. The
official story is that their helicopter must have crashed, either
because they were hit by an RPG or because…well, that’s what happens
when you fly a helicopter while you’re tripping on acid. All I know is
they’ve never been seen since. Like all Shaman they returned to the
sky.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: When I got back home I wrote the story up.
Everything.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I sent it to the newspapers, the radio
stations, the TV stations, because that was what Lyn wanted me to do.
The people needed to know.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I was ready for whatever they would do to me. I
was ready to disappear. I was ready to go to prison. I was a Jedi and I
was fighting for the New Earth Army.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: But they didn’t put me in prison. They did
something much worse.</p>
<p>****: And finally, US forces in Iraq are using what some are calling
a cruel and unusual tool to break the resistance of Iraqi POWs, and many
parents would agree! Some prisoners are being forced to listen to Barney
the Purple Dinosaur sing the I Love You song. I think after an hour of
that they’ll spill the beans! Don’t you? Let’s go outside to Al for the
weather.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: That was it. That was the only bit of my story
that ran anywhere. And it was a joke. And if I ever needed proof of how
the Dark Side have taken the beautiful dream of what a nation could be
and had twisted it, destroyed it, that was it.</p>
<p><strong>bob’s editor</strong>: Bob?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: But I won’t stop. I won’t give up.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Because when I look at what is happening in the
world, I know that now, more than ever, we need to become ALL that we
can BE.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Now, more than ever, we need the Supermen.</p>
