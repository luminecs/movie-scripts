<p><strong>mrs. teasdale</strong>: It is so good of you to come.</p>
<p><strong>notable</strong>: An honor, Mrs. Teasdale… You must indeed
have great faith in your new dictator to give him such a magnificent
reception.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. teasdale</strong>: I feel that Rufus T. Firefly is the
only logical successor to my dear departed husband. He has the
statesmanship of Gladstone, the humility of Lincoln, and the wisdom of
Pericles.</p>
<p><strong>first cabinet member</strong>: Mrs. Teasdale, as members of
Freedonia’s cabinet, we do not approve of your choice. Who is this Rufus
T. Firefly?</p>
<p><strong>second cabinet member</strong>: A stranger in our midst, an
agent for the Eureka Ammunition Company. Think of it, Gentlemen, an
ammunition salesman dictating the policies of our peace-loving
country.</p>
<p><strong>third cabinet member</strong>: Reconsider, Mrs. Teasdale,
before it is too late. The citizens of Freedonia want a President!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. teasdale</strong>: As the widow of your last president,
I have the right to choose – and, Gentlemen, I refuse to discuss the
matter any further.</p>
<p><strong>servant</strong>: His Excellency, Ambassador Verdi Trentino
of Amnesia!</p>
<p><strong>trentino</strong>: Mrs. Teasdale… my niece, Vera.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. teasdale</strong>: Your uncle has been such a friend to
us in every crisis. Without his country’s financial aid –</p>
<p><strong>trentino</strong>: What is money? Mrs. Teasdale, for you – I
would do anything.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. teasdale</strong>: Ambassador! I am so anxious for you
to meet our new dictator.</p>
<p><strong>trentino</strong>: Mrs. Teasdale – no matter who rules
Freedonia, to me you will always be the first lady of the land.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Mrs. Teasdale, my uncle’s hopeless – you’ve
been the only topic of conversation ever since we left Amnesia.</p>
<p><strong>servant</strong>: The Honorable Mohamed Pandooh of
Mufhtan!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. teasdale</strong>: Oh, I must greet His Honor.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: So that’s the one you want to marry.</p>
<p><strong>trentino</strong>: With Mrs. Teasdale as my wife and
Freedonia under my control –</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Maybe it’s not going to be so easy. From what
I’ve heard, Mrs. Teasdale is rather sweet on this Rufus T. Firefly.</p>
<p><strong>trentino</strong>: That’s where you come in. I’ll leave him
in your hands, and don’t forget you’re supposed to be my niece.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. teasdale</strong>: I want you to meet the son of His
Excellency – Bob Firefly…</p>
<p><strong>trentino</strong>: Isn’t it about time for the ceremony to
begin, Mrs. Teasdale? I do hope His Excellency won’t be late.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: My father makes it a point to always be on
time. As long as I’ve known him, he’s never been late for an
appointment.</p>
<p><strong>trentino</strong>: But it’s two minutes of ten now.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: His Excellency is due To take his station.
Beginning his new Administration… He’ll make his appearance when The
clock on the wall strikes ten.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. teasdale</strong>: When the clock on the wall strikes
ten All you loyal ladies and you patriotic men Let’s sing the national
anthem when… The clock on the wall strikes ten.</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: Hail, hail, Freedonia… Mightiest of mighty
nations! Hail, hail, Freedonia Land of the brave and free.</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: Hail, hail, Freedonia… Land of the brave and
free.</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: Hail, hail, Freedonia… Land of the brave and
free.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. teasdale</strong>: I hope nothing has happened.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Mrs. Teasdale, I assure you there is nothing to
worry about. Father is probably taking extra care in getting into his
robes of state. I’ll call him.</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: Hail, hail, Freedonia… Land of the brave and
free.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. teasdale</strong>: As chairwoman of the reception
committee, I welcome you and extend the good wishes of every man, woman
and child of Freedonia. I deem it an honor on this momentous
occasion…</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Never mind that stuff…</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Take a card.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. teasdale</strong>: What’ll I do with this card?</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: You can keep it – I’ve got a whole pack…
Now what were you saying?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. teasdale</strong>: As chairwoman of the reception
committee, I welcome you with open arms.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: How late do you stay open?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. teasdale</strong>: In choosing you, I feel that I serve
my country well. I heartily endorse everything you stand for.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Well, I won’t stand for much. And I won’t
stand for you if you don’t show some improvement soon. Look at your
report card last month – “D” in spelling… six in behavior. Now who were
the six? A fine state of affairs – no wonder you can’t matriculate, now
what were you saying?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. teasdale</strong>: The future of Freedonia rests upon
you. Promise me you will follow in my husband’s footsteps.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: I haven’t been on the job five minutes and
already she’s making advances to me. Not that I care – but where is your
husband?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. teasdale</strong>: Why - er – my husband passed away… I
was with him to the very end.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: No wonder he passed away. I’d like to be
with you to the very end. Can’t you see what I’m trying to tell you – I
love you.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. teasdale</strong>: Your Excellency!</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: You’re not so bad yourself, Mrs. Teasdale,
when I look at you I can see that we’re facing a crisis. We’ve got to
balance the budget – we’ve got to cut down everything including,
you.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. teasdale</strong>: Oh… Your Excellency… I would like to
present to you… Ambassador Verdi Trentino Of Amnesia… Having him with us
today is indeed a great honor.</p>
<p><strong>trentino</strong>: Thanks… but I can’t stay very long.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: That’s even a greater honor.</p>
<p><strong>trentino</strong>: I bring you the greetings of my President
and the good will of my people.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: I’ll keep the greetings – but you can send
back the good will… what we need right now is twenty million
dollars.</p>
<p><strong>trentino</strong>: Twenty million dollars is a considerable
sum… I’ll have to discuss that with my Minister of Finance.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Well, in the meantime, could you let me
have $50 personally?</p>
<p><strong>trentino</strong>: $50?</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: I’ll tell you what I’ll do. I’ll give you
Mrs. Teasdale as security. or my jackknife. If you want my advice,
you’ll take the jackknife… I’ve a better proposition… Make it $25 and
I’ll give you a first mortgage on my son and I hope you foreclose.</p>
<p><strong>trentino</strong>: Your Excellency, haven’t we met
before?</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Why yes. I met you at the dog races – say,
you could have won that race if you tried a little harder.</p>
<p><strong>trentino</strong>: Excellency, may I present my niece.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>trentino</strong>: You don’t understand. This is my niece
Vera.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: And Vera niece, too.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Your Excellency, please don’t think me silly,
but I’d love to have a picture of you. I want to hang it in my
bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: You couldn’t hang me in your bedroom – I’ll
make a note of it. Where’s my secretary?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Here I am, Father.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Take a letter.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: stenographer’s pad</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: The President of the United States.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: My dear President… read it back…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: “My dear President”…</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: That doesn’t sound right… take out
“President”… now read it.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: “My dear”…</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: That’s not right yet… put back “President”
and take out “dear”… How does it read now?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: “My President”…</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: There’s still something wrong with it… take
out “President” …now what’ve you got?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: “My”…</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Now we’re on the right track… Put back
“dear”… How does it read?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: “My dear”…</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: You can’t say that to the President… Put
back “President”… Now let’s hear how sounds.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: “My dear President”…</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: That’s what I wanted in the first place.
Tear it up and send it airmail.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Is that all?</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Take another letter… to my tailor.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Dear Sir… enclosed find check for $100.
Yours very truly… Send that immediately.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I’ll have to enclose the check first.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: You do and I’ll fire you.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. teasdale</strong>: Your Excellency, the eyes of the
world are upon you. Notables from every land are gathered here in your
honor – This is a gala day for us.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Well, a gal a day is enough for me. I
couldn’t handle any more.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. teasdale</strong>: If it’s not asking too much – For our
information just for illustration Tell us how you intend to run the
nation.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: These are the laws of my administration: No
one’s allowed to smoke or tell a dirty joke – And whistling is
forbidden…</p>
<p><strong>ensemble</strong>: We’re not allowed to tell a dirty joke
HAIL, HAIL, FREEDONIA</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: If chewing gum is chewed, The chewer is
pursued And in the hoosegow hidden…</p>
<p><strong>ensemble</strong>: If we should choose to chew, we’ll be
pursued -</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: If any form of pleasure is exhibited Report
to me and it will be prohibited. I’ll put my foot down; So shall it be -
This is the land of the free. The last man nearly ruined this place He
didn’t know what to do with it. If you think this country’s bad off now
Just wait ’till I get through with it. The treasury is low on dough; The
last man went and flew with it. If you think we’re short of money now
Just wait ’till I get through with it. The country’s taxes must be fixed
- And I know what to do with it, If you think you’re paying too much
now, Just wait ’till I get through with it.</p>
<p><strong>dignitary</strong>: In our midst you stand The ruler of this
land A man who’ll govern with an iron hand.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: If anyone gets fresh with me, I’ll show him
who’s the boss; I’ll stand upon my dignity, And toss him for a loss. And
this will be the penalty For those who doublecross - We’ll stand ’em up
against the wall, and Pop goes the Weasel</p>
<p><strong>ensemble</strong>: If you should make him cross, He’ll toss
you for a loss. If anyone gets fresh with him, He’ll show him who’s the
boss.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: I will not stand for anything that’s
crooked or unfair; I’m strictly on the up and up, So everyone beware. If
anyone’s caught taking graft And I don’t get my share, we’ll stand ’em
up against the wall - and pop goes the weasel!</p>
<p><strong>ensemble</strong>: So everyone beware Who’s crooked or
unfair; No one must take a bit of graft Unless he gets his share.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: If any man should come between A husband
and his bride, We find out which one she prefers By letting her decide.
If she prefers the other man, The husband steps outside; We stand him up
against the wall And Pop goes the Weasel!</p>
<p><strong>ensemble</strong>: The husband steps outside; Relinquishes
his bride; We stand him up against the wall And take him for a ride.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: The population must increase With great
rapidity. We give a couple seven years To raise a family. If, by that
time, there is no branch Upon the family tree, we stand ’em up against
the wall - and Pop goes the Weasel.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. teasdale</strong>: You’ve made a wonderful impression.
Your views are liberal… It is easy to see you have an open mind.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: That’s what I get for dressing in a
hurry.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. teasdale</strong>: Your Excellency, you mustn’t forget
your appointment at the House of Representatives… Have you got your
speech ready?</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: I wrote a speech last night that’ll knock
them off their seats… Four score and seven years ago, our fathers
brought forth on this continent a new nation –</p>
<p><strong>mrs. teasdale</strong>: Why, that’s the speech that Lincoln
made at Gettysburg…</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: He did?… I told my son not to leave it
laying around… Where is son?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Here I am, Father…</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Send for my car…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: His Excellency’s car!</p>
<p><strong>guards</strong>: His Excellency’s car!</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: To the House of Representatives… ride like
fury… Don’t stop for any signals and don’t wait for a corner to make a
turn… see if you can break a record…</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: A fine thing – leaving the head of the
nation at the foot of the stairs…</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: That concludes the nine o’clock sprints…
Next Saturday night the winner of the six day bicycle race will receive
ten thousand dollars in gold… the following morning we go off the gold
standard…</p>
<p><strong>speaker</strong>: Gentlemen, gentlemen, remember for
forty-six years we have enjoyed the friendship of Amnesia, so ably
represented by Ambassador Trentino. We owe it to ourselves to listen to
what he has to say…</p>
<p><strong>trentino</strong>: Gentlemen, while I admit it is unusual for
a representative of one country to advise the legislative body of
another, I assure you that I have the interest of Freedonia at heart …
We have lent you money in the past – we are willing to lend you money
again – but, we cannot do it if your leader is allowed by you, to carry
out his ridiculous proposals… In self-protection it is my –</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I object!… we have no right to discuss this
matter in the absence of my father.</p>
<p><strong>speaker</strong>: We have been meeting every morning for
eight days and not once has His Excellency been on time…</p>
<p><strong>trentino</strong>: Gentlemen, I cannot wait much longer…</p>
<p><strong>speaker</strong>: Would you mind calling your father
again?</p>
<p><strong>members</strong>: HAIL, HAIL, FREEDONIA Land of the brave and
free…</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: The Secretary of Agriculture was a little
flat… I move we open the morning session… Has anybody got a cork
screw?</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: What’s to stop you from digging one… And
after you dig a river, how’re ya gonna cross it without a bridge…? We’ve
got to have a bridge to stop people from going places – then we’ve gotta
stop them from coming back. If you’re worried about the expense we can
have a bridge with only one end – and if that’s a success we can do away
with it altogether. I’m telling you that what this country needs is
–</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: If there’s one thing we don’t need right
now – it’s peanuts – gentlemen, what good is a bridge if you haven’t got
ammunition to blow it up… ammunition was never cheaper… Right now, you
can get two cannons for the price of one and shoot twice as far for half
the money… With every five thousand dollar purchase we throw in a Big
Bertha… If you don’t like her, you can throw her right out again. I tell
you no country can protect itself without –</p>
<p><strong>speaker</strong>: I’m sorry your Excellency, it is that
infernal peanut vendor Chicolini… How can we accomplish anything with
that constant annoyance?</p>
<p><strong>trentino</strong>: Your Excellency - are we or are we not
going to discuss this problem - my time is valuable - I’m a man of few
words -</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: I’m a man of one word… SCRAM!!!</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Go out and chase that peanut vendor away
from the building – Get rid of him if you have to use violence - if
necessary call out the militia and if he isn’t looking get me a bag of
peanuts.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I’ve tried to chase him but it’s no use - he
won’t go -</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: He won’t eh? - We’ll see about that - send
for your father immediately.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: But you’re my father -</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Never mind then, I’ll get in touch with him
myself -</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: How’m I doing, boss?</p>
<p><strong>trentino</strong>: Fine - keep on yelling - Do everything you
can to disturb Firefly - Now what about your cousin?</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: He’s working very hard - I got him a job
driving Firefly’s car - He’s-a driving him crazy and I’m driving him
nuts - P-E-A-N-U-T-S</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: I’ll get rid of that pest - watch me –</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Hey you!!</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: All right -</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Have you got a license?</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: No, but my dog he’s a got millions of them
–</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Chico walks over and</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: He used to be a bloodhound but he’s anemic
–</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Well - what is he now?</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: He’s half poodle and half watch dog -</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Half watch dog?</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: Yeh, he’s only got one eye.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: I don’t know much about dogs but you ought
to be on the end of a leash - a ninety-nine year leash - Look - what do
you call your dog?</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: I don’t call him, I whistle.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: What do you whistle?</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: Yankee Poodle.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: I’ve got just the place for a man like you
but I’m too busy right now to do any digging. What do you call your dog
when you want him?</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: I don’t want him.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Well, if you don’t want your dog why don’t
you put him in a pound?</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: He only weighs ten ounces –</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: I can use you in the House of
Representatives. We need a man who understands dogs – and that’s where
this country is going to. Step inside.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: In case of fire, how long will it take to
empty this place?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: About - thirty-four seconds.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: We’ll start a fire – – and get rid of these
microbes.</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: Hello!… Yes… Yes… He’s not in…</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: That was for you.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: I’m sorry I’m not in. I wanted to have a
long talk with you… Now look here, my good man, you’ve got to stop
yelling “peanuts” in front of the House of Representatives.</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: Oh no, I can’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: You don’t want to be a public nuisance, do
you?</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: Sure. How much does the job pay? Sure, if
there’s a chance for advancement.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: You wouldn’t consider going over Niagara
Falls without a barrel?</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: ’At’s-a no good. I went to Niagara Falls
once.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Did you shoot the rapids?</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: No, but I shot some ducks.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: If there was an open season for fellows
like you, I’d get myself a hunting license. Anyway, I’m going to make
you a sporting proposition. You give up the peanut stand and I’ll make
you vice-president of the country.</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: Oh, no – nothing doing. I had a brother who
was a vice-president once and that’s the last we ever heard of him.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Well, maybe he’s still the vice- president.
Now if I were to offer you –</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: Hello… Yes… No, not yet… All right… Goodbye.
That was for you again. He wants you to call him up as soon as you get
back.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: I don’t know what’s keeping me. I should’ve
been here a long time ago. Now how about my proposition?</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: What other job you got?</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Let’s see – What’ve I got in my cabinet
besides mice – I’ve got it – how would you like to be Secretary of the
Interior?</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: That’s no good. I like to work on the
outside. I must have something easy.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Then you don’t wanna work hard?</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: I don’t wanna work at all.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: In that case you’ll have to take a civil
service examination – if you pass I’ll put you in the post-office –
stick out your tongue.</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: I don’t wanna stick out my tongue.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Well, if you wanna work in the post- office
you’ll have to stick out your tongue.</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: Look, I’m a very nervous man. I gotta have a
job where I come to work at eleven – go to lunch at twelve – and quit at
one. And twice a year I gotta have a six month vacation.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: I’ve got just the job for you – Secretary
of War.</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: ’At’s-a fine.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: You know, I’d be lost without a telephone.
Now - where were we? Oh, yes - I just made you Secretary of War. The
first thing you do is buy ammunition – you buy it from me and I get 10%
commission.</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: What do I get?</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: You get half mine and I get half yours.</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: I don’t want to buy ammunition – we no gotta
war.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Then we’ve gotta start one. Do you know how
to start a war?</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: Sure, that’s easy. You gotta insult
somebody.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: My card.</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: That’s a-no good. You gotta insult somebody
from another country. Look – I come from one country. You come from
another country. I say something you don’t like. You say something I
don’t like - and I’m insulted.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Why wasn’t I insulted?</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: You was insulted, but you don’t know it.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Then I demand an apology!</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: That’s a-no good. If I apologize we no got a
war. Look – I send you a scrap of paper. You send me a scrap of paper –
and we have a scrap.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: You’ve got a brain after all - and how you
get along without it is amazing to me – Now, who can I insult?… Who do
we owe money to?… AMBASSADOR TRENTINO! How about him?</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: He’s-a very easy to insult – I say something
to his niece once, and he slapped my face.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Why didn’t his niece slap your face?</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: She did.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: What did you say to her?</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: You’re lucky I don’t slap your face – you
oughtta be ashamed of yourself. Where did you hear that story?</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: You told it to me.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Oh, yes, I remember – and I should have
slapped Mrs. Teasdale’s face when she told it to me… I’m going right out
and find Trentino. You go right out and get yourself an army.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Wait a minute. What kind of an army do you
think we oughtta have?</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: I think we oughtta have a standing army, so
we can save money on chairs.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: To Mrs. Teasdale’s residence!</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: This is the fifth trip I’ve made today and
I haven’t been anywhere yet.</p>
<p><strong>guard’s voice</strong>: His Excellency, Rufus T. Firefly!</p>
<p><strong>guests</strong>: HAIL, HAIL, FREEDONIA Land of the brave and
free…</p>
<p><strong>trentino’s voice</strong>: Can’t you see, Gloria, our
marriage would not only unite two great families…</p>
<p><strong>trentino</strong>: …but would further cement the relations of
our countries.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. teasdale</strong>: Ambassador Trentino, I am indeed
honored… But you see - well - I –</p>
<p><strong>trentino</strong>: Oh. Then there his somebody else?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. teasdale</strong>: Well no – not exactly – but –</p>
<p><strong>trentino</strong>: Gloria – I’ve waited for years. I won’t be
put off! I love you! I want you! Can’t you see that I’m at your
feet?</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: When you get through with her feet, you can
start on mine. I haven’t been to a chiropodist in two years… If that’s
not an insult, I don’t know what is. Gloria, I love you. I –</p>
<p><strong>trentino</strong>: Can’t we go some place where we can be
alone?</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: What can this mug offer you? Wealth and
family. I can’t give you wealth… …but we can have a little family of our
own.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. teasdale</strong>: Oh, Rufus!</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: All I can offer you is a Rufus over your
head.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. teasdale</strong>: Oh, Your Excellency, I don’t know
what to say.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: I wouldn’t know what to say either if I was
in your place. Maybe you can suggest something.</p>
<p><strong>trentino</strong>: This has gone far enough! This
interruption is humiliating, to say the least…</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Well, why not say the least and get it over
with?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. teasdale</strong>: Gentlemen! Gentlemen!</p>
<p><strong>trentino</strong>: I didn’t come here to be insulted.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: That’s what you think.</p>
<p><strong>trentino</strong>: You swine!</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Give me that again!</p>
<p><strong>trentino</strong>: You worm!</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Once more!</p>
<p><strong>trentino</strong>: You upstart!</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: That’s it! No man lives who can call a
Firefly an upstart.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Touch�.</p>
<p><strong>trentino</strong>: I shall report this indignity the my
President. Mrs. Teasdale, I feel this regrettable occurrence will plunge
our countries into war.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. teasdale</strong>: This is terrible!</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Uncle, you can’t do this!</p>
<p><strong>trentino</strong>: My dear niece – I must ask you not to
interfere. War is not a woman’s problem.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: It is every woman’s problem. Who supplies the
sons? – the brothers? – the husbands? Who…</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: You keep that up and you’ll crab the whole
war.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Carry out this tragic folly if you will – But
I for one will not be a part of it. I will stay here in Freedonia.</p>
<p><strong>trentino</strong>: understanding vanishes</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Then it’s war?</p>
<p><strong>trentino</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: How’re ya fixed for ammunition?</p>
<p><strong>trentino</strong>: Bah!!</p>
<p><strong>wanted</strong>: - A female spy.</p>
<p><strong>wanted</strong>: – A Chauffeur Below the war nurse ad we see
part of another ad in which a cook is wanted.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: The Secretary of War will see you next,
Miss.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Did you hear the one about the woman taking a
bath?… Well, she forgot to lock the door… A man came in and said, “I’m a
doctor”… The woman said, “I’m not sick”… and the man said, “that’s all
right. I’m not a doctor.”</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Look!</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: You look pretty good to me - but very still
need a spy - Have you got any credentials?</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: You got credentials all right.</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: This is fine. Put it back.</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: I think I better take another look at that
paper…</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: I look this over later – now I look you over.
If you want to be a spy, you gotta be in good condition. I better
examine you.</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: There’s something wrong – I think I’m getting
Whiteman’s band.</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: According to my watch it’s four o’clock. Now
look – a woman spy is a-gotta make love to men. Come on – let’s see you
make love…</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: Now you feel my pulse.</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: Send in the next girl.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: By the way, are you sure we need a spy?</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: Sure, we gotta have a spy. If we no got a spy
who’s gonna tell the other side what we’re doing?</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: Have you got any credentials?</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: I don’t go in much for modern art. Have you
got anything by one of the old masters?</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: I’m glad I didn’t ask you for “Washington
Crossing the Delaware”.</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: We’ve gotta have somebody who knows how to
get secrets from men. You know how to make love?</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: You ought to carry a spare.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: We’re certainly living in a marvelous
age.</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: That’s very funny… he certainly fooled me.
He’ll make a good spy.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: If we can’t use him as a spy, we can have
him framed.</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: Say, that’s a nice collection. You oughta
have a catalogue.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Let’s take a look at number eighteen.</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: Say, she’s all right. You got-a her phone
number?</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: That’s a funny one!</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: I think we can use you. Here’s a spy glass…
go ahead and do some spying…</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: He’s going to make a good spy… that’s not bad
for the first day.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: That’s not bad for any day.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Maybe my eyes are bad - you take a
look.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: You’re right about that guy – I think we’ve
got something.</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: I don’t know about us, but I know he’s-a got
something…</p>
<p><strong>trentino</strong>: This is all Firefly’s fault – that idiot,
that fool…</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: I thought everything was working out fine.</p>
<p><strong>trentino</strong>: Fine nothing! I didn’t want war… My plan
was to marry Mrs. Teasdale and overthrow Firefly.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Maybe you can still win the old dame over –
why not try to –</p>
<p><strong>mrs. teasdale</strong>: I’m so sorry I’ve kept you
waiting…</p>
<p><strong>trentino</strong>: Mrs. Teasdale… I deeply regret the
unfortunate affair with his Excellency, but his attitude left me no
alternative…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. teasdale</strong>: To think that this should happen
after all these years of friendship.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Maybe the war can still be averted…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. teasdale</strong>: Oh, if only it could…</p>
<p><strong>trentino</strong>: Mrs. Teasdale, I’m willing to pocket my
pride and do anything I can to make up with his Excellency.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. teasdale</strong>: Oh, would you…?</p>
<p><strong>trentino</strong>: For you, I would do anything…</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: If only we can get his Excellency to listen to
reason…</p>
<p><strong>trentino</strong>: Perhaps he will listen to you…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. teasdale</strong>: Perhaps… I’ll call him…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. teasdale</strong>: Hello, your Excellency?… I hate to
disturb you – I know you’re a very busy man, but I must see you at
once.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Why not come over here? – You can come in
the back way and no one’ll see you…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. teasdale</strong>: But your Excellency, you must – oh
thank you – please hurry… He’ll be right over…</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: If I knew you were here I would’ve brought
some cheese…</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: So – you’ve come to ask for clemency! I’ll
give the enemy no quarter – not a dime…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. teasdale</strong>: But Your Excellency – the Ambassador
is here on a friendly visit… He came to ask you to patch up the
breach.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Let him patch up his own breeches…</p>
<p><strong>trentino</strong>: I’m sorry we lost our tempers… I’m willing
to forget if you are.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Forget? You ask me to forget… Why, my
ancestors would rise from their graves… and I’d only have to bury them
again… A Firefly never forgets…</p>
<p><strong>trentino</strong>: I am willing to apologize… I’m willing to
do anything to prevent this war.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Nothing doing!! I’ve taken a lease on the
battlefield. I’d lose my deposit, besides, I’ve already ordered the
ammunition…</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Oh, Your Excellency, isn’t there something I
can do?</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Yes, but I’ll talk to you about that when
we’re alone…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. teasdale</strong>: Oh, won’t you reconsider…</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Well, maybe I am a little headstrong… But,
you know, it’s awfully hard to forget what he called me.</p>
<p><strong>trentino</strong>: What I called you… Why, what did I call
you?</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: I don’t remember.</p>
<p><strong>trentino</strong>: Oh – you mean… worm?</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: No, that wasn’t it…</p>
<p><strong>trentino</strong>: Was it – swine?</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: No… it was a seven letter word.</p>
<p><strong>trentino</strong>: Oh yes! – UPSTART!</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: That’s it…</p>
<p><strong>trentino</strong>: Why - er - Mrs. Teasdale - this is an
outrage! This man is impossible… My course is clear… this means war… You
RUNT!</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: I still like UPSTART the best.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Oh, this is dreadful! If you’ll excuse me I’ll
go to my room…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. teasdale</strong>: Yes, it’s awful! Are you sure you did
the right thing?</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Of course. Who ever heard of calling off a
war after ordering all the ammunition?</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: The plans of war are in this envelope. I
want you to take care of them – no one will ever suspect you.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Guard them with your life… don’t leave them
out of your sight… If the enemy gets those papers we’re lost. If they
don’t get them, we’re lost. Can’t you see what I’m trying to tell you? I
love you… Mrs. Teasdale, you’re the salt of the earth. They don’t come
any better than you…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. teasdale</strong>: bashful lowering of</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Well – they might come better but they
don’t come any bigger… and the bigger the better. The bigger the betta
you’ve got on a horse, the more you lose, and speaking about horses, why
don’t you marry me. Come, come – say yes and you’ll never see me again.
I’ll go ’way if it means your happiness…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. teasdale</strong>: Oh, your Excellency, you take me off
my feet.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Swell chance I’ve got taking you off your
feet…</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Gloria – may I call you Gloria?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. teasdale</strong>: Why – why – of course.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: You can call me Gloria too. Gloria – what a
beautiful name. When I was born my mother named me Gloria – two minutes
later she found out her mistake…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Father…</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Bob… without being a bit disturbed…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Who to?</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: None of your business… Take another
letter.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Eureka Ammunition Company – Gentlemen –
Your shipment of sailor hats arrived this morning by freight – Gloria, I
could go for you in a big way – However, the rifles you sent were a
little rusty – – and I don’t say that to everybody – Have not received
last month’s drawing account. How come? Your neck is like a swan… Yours
very truly. Now read it back.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Eureka Ammunition Company, Gentlemen. Your
shipment of sailor hats arrived this morning by freight. Gloria, I could
go for you in a big way. However, the rifles you sent were a little
rusty and I don’t say that to everybody. Have not received last month’s
drawing account; how come your neck is like a swan. Yours very
truly…</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: They’ll know I mean business then they get
that letter… see that that gets out immediately and that goes for you
too.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Gloria, much as I hate to leave, I’d be
crazy to stay here.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. teasdale</strong>: Well, if you must go –</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: I’m not taking any more chances. You sit in
the sidecar…</p>
<p><strong>usher</strong>: I’m sorry gentlemen - but you have the wrong
seats.</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: That’s all right. We’re not enjoying
ourselves anyway.</p>
<p><strong>usher</strong>: You belong in that box over there -</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: Come on –</p>
<p><strong>trentino</strong>: Wait a minute… Mrs. Teasdale is in the box
below. The plans of war are in her purse – you’ve got to get them – I
don’t care how, but get them – and when you do, bring them to 492 North
Myrtle Road – you’d better write that down.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. teasdale</strong>: I wonder what’s keeping His
Excellency?</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: Never mind His Excellency – you gotta your
pocketbook?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. teasdale</strong>: Yes – why?</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: I wanna powder my nose…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. teasdale</strong>: If his Excellency doesn’t get here
soon, he’ll miss the whole performance.</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: He’s-a not missing anything. He’s in the
dressing room with Vera Trentino.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. teasdale</strong>: In her dressing room? Why, what could
he be doing there?</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: He could be playing solitaire, but I don’t
think so.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. teasdale</strong>: What’s the matter with you?</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: What’s the matter with you?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. teasdale</strong>: You haven’t been still a moment since
you’ve been here. You act as if you had neurosis –</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: I no gotta new-rosis. My uncle he’s- a got a
flower shop – he’s-a gotta new-rosis.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: I shall dance for you tonight as I’ve never
danced before.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: This is a fine thing to be doing at my
age.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Are you getting tired?</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Not at all. When I was a boy back on the
farm I used to pump my own water.</p>
<p><strong>valet</strong>: Your love is waiting for you, my lord…</p>
<p><strong>hero</strong>: Fetch my hat - my hat - my hat –</p>
<p><strong>hero</strong>: Fetch my boots – Bring me my sword –</p>
<p><strong>mrs. teasdale</strong>: My purse – my purse is gone!</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: He no got it —</p>
<p><strong>mrs. teasdale</strong>: This is dreadful – I must see His
Excellency at once —</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Are you sure you’re not tired?</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Tired! I’d like to stretch this into a week
-</p>
<p><strong>mrs. teasdale</strong>: I hope I’m not interrupting.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: looks over his shoulder at Mrs.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. teasdale</strong>: Your Excellency, something terrible
has just happened.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: That’s all right. I’ll fix you right
up.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. teasdale</strong>: My purse has been stolen – the plans
of war are in it.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. teasdale</strong>: I – I may be wrong, but I suspect the
Secretary of War.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Don’t bother me - I’m thinking – What was
that?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. teasdale</strong>: I said - I suspect the Secretary of
War.</p>
<p><strong>this is treason!!</strong>: raising his clenched hands; then
to Mrs.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. teasdale</strong>: But -</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: You satisfied your selfish whims, while
nations tottered, dynasties rocked and the world plunged headlong into a
chasm of chaos and oblivion – Not bad, eh?</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: This is-a fine - you do a good job - you
make-a no trouble and you waste- a no time. Come on, we take-a the plans
to the Ambassador. You gotta the address?</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Hands up!</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: You no gotta no gun.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Who said I had a gun… Gimme those plans,
you paper snatchers –</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Here – put these plans where no one will
ever find them - sleep on them.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: I’m sorry boys – I did my best – it’s all my
fault.</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: It’s not-a your fault. It’s-a his fault – I
fix it for you to getta the plans – you getta the plans – then you losa-
a the plans – now we no gotta the plans of war…</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: It’s all your fault. Now we gotta steal the
plans again – You had ’em on you… you take a bath… and now we no gotta
plans of war.</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: You wait here – I’ll let you in.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Psst…</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: In the safe – behind the drapes –</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: All right – I’ll meet you behind the
drapes.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: No, no – I mean the plans are in the safe.</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: Come on, we gotta no time for that.</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: Wait a minute… we make too much noise… Turn
on the radio so they can’t hear what we’re doing.</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: What’s-a matter, you crazy… ?</p>
<p><strong>radio police announcer</strong>: Calling car 125… car 125… go
to vacant lot at Tenth and Elm… a woman walking around in her nightgown
—</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: Come on, we gotta finish the job…</p>
<p><strong>radio police announcer</strong>: Calling car 67-W… car 67-W…
go to Mrs. Teasdale’s residence… burglars are attempting to break
in.</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: Hello – Police department… ? That fellow’s
crazy… we’re in the house already…</p>
<p><strong>radio announcer</strong>: The Teasdale residence is located
at 232 Poloma Drive…</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: You’ll never find us, you gotta the wrong
address… we’re at 235 Poloma Drive… not 232… Look, it’s a white house
with a shingle roof – shingle – shingle – Shingle bells, shingle bells,
shingle all the way… That’s it, you got it… Hurry up, if no get-a here
soon, we can’t wait…</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: Hey, Skippy…</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: Hey, you never get the safe open that way. We
gotta try the combination… You gotta the combination?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. teasdale</strong>: Hello? Your Excellency? There are
burglars in the house… I want you to come right over.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: You come over here. There are no burglars
in my house.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. teasdale</strong>: But Your Excellency, you must – I
tell you there are burglars here… Oh, thank you… Please hurry…</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: Light it… Now we blow him up…</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: Wait a minute… we gotta fix it so it don’t
make-a so much noise… What-a we do?</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: That’s fine… Now, nobody hear the noise.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: That woman is crazy… there are no burglars
around here…</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: They’re coming… Ride through every village
and town wake every citizen up hill and down tell them the enemy comes
from afar with a hey-nonny-nonny and a ha-cha- char</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: There’ll be two lamps in the steeple if
they’re coming by land and one lamp if they’re coming by sea.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: They double-crossed me… they’re coming by
land and sea – Be off, my lad!</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Either there’s a fly in the room or we’ve
got a soldier in Africa.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: A dispatch from the front, sir.</p>
<p><strong>a general</strong>: Bad news, sir?</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Bad news – its disastrous!</p>
<p><strong>a few generals</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Private Moscowitz quits!</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Clear all wires…</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: The enemy has taken Hill 25, throwing
twelve Hill-billies out of work… Our front is exposed to the enemy –
we’ll have to bring up the rear… P.S. Have misplaced flag of truce… look
in upper lefthand drawer of my bureau…</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Late again, eh? You haven’t been on time
once since this war started… Get out there and fight…</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: I can’t do it…</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Why not? You’re the Secretary of War,
aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: Yes, but I’m not working for you any more.
I’m on the other side.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Is that so? I used to think you were
two-faced - but you can’t be - or you wouldn’t be wearing that one. Now
- let’s talk this thing over.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Now – how many men you got in your
army?</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: Well, we gotta one hundred thousand men.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: That’s not fair – we’ve only got fifty
thousand.</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: That’s all right. We let you have twenty-five
thousand men – and we both start even.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: That’s the spirit – fifty-fifty.</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: No. Seventy-five – seventy-five.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Well, we’ll let that one go. Now – how many
battalions you got?</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: We gotta two battalions and one
Frenchman.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: I wish you were still working for me, so I
could ask you to resign. How’re ya fixed for cavalry?</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: I’ve gotta five thousand men but no
horses.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: That’s funny, we’ve got five thousand
horses but no men.</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: That’s all right – our men can ride your
horses.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Not a bad idea. If our horses get tired
they can ride your men for a change. Now, I don’t mind letting you have
our horses, but you must promise to put them through their
maneuvers.</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: Oh, sure. We have horse maneuvers every
morning.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Acme Ammunition Company, eh? How do you
expect to win the war with shells that don’t go off? Now, if you were
buying your stuff from me, you wouldn’t have that trouble. Eureka
Ammunition is guaranteed to explode – or your money back. Let me show
you some samples.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Bring in No. 47, line 8.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: That’s our latest number… our sixteen-inch
Horowitz gun. Load it up.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: With a gun like that you can kill some of
your own men.</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: That’s-a pretty good. I’ll take a dozen of
them.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Anything else?</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: Yes, one gross of bullets, two dozen
hand-grenades, three kegs of powder – and throw in some matches.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Fine. We’ll throw in the matches before we
make the delivery. By the way, how’re you fixed for spys?</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: Fine. We gotta him.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: So! – He’s on your side, too.</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Well, with you two fellows on the other
side, this country should have no trouble keeping the wolf from the
door.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Something must be done immediately. The
soldiers are getting discouraged.</p>
<p><strong>trentino</strong>: There’s only one thing to do… we must
capture Firefly.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: But how? It’s a very dangerous
undertaking.</p>
<p><strong>trentino</strong>: Ask for volunteers. Some one must make the
sacrifice – someone – Here comes Chicolini. Maybe he’ll do it. Unless we
can make Firefly our prisoner, we’re lost.</p>
<p><strong>trentino</strong>: Chicolini, you’ve come just in time. We
need a man who’s fearless, brave. A man who’s willing to die, if
necessary.</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: All right – I’ll go out and find one.</p>
<p><strong>trentino</strong>: Firefly must be captured at any cost.</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: That’s easy, I’ll get him for you
wholesale.</p>
<p><strong>trentino</strong>: It must be done right away.</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: I can’t do it right away.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: I got a date with a General’s wife.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Isn’t that a little dangerous?</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: Not unless you find it out.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Boys, I hate to do this, but if you
generals want this war to continue you’ll have to take a cut –</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: We can’t afford to pay the money we’ve been
paying. Now I don’t want to lay anybody off. My motto in this war is: -
“Live and let live”.</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: Look! That’s-a Firefly’s headquarters. We
catch him right now.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Gentlemen, the overhead is killing us.
Everything is going up. If we don’t watch ourselves, we’ll come down
with a crash. Now – all those in favor of taking a cut say “aye”…</p>
<p><strong>one general</strong>: But Your Excellency!</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Carried unanimously.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Now go right out there and fight. You go
out there and relieve General Beauregard, and while you’re at it, see
what General Motors is doing.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Call him back – he didn’t salute me.</p>
<p><strong>zeppo</strong>: Father, he didn’t salute you either.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Attention!</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Go out there – all of you – and bring those
generals back – dead or alive.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Why don’t those generals come back?</p>
<p><strong>zeppo</strong>: I’ll call them.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Never mind, I’ll go after them myself.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Hey, Junior!</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Get my rifle.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: I’ll get rid of them.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Take a letter.</p>
<p><strong>zeppo</strong>: To whom?</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: To whom it may concern… Dear Gloria: The
air has done me a world of good. I am five thousand feet above sea level
speeding home to you. Can you arrange to meet me at twenty-five hundred
feet? – which is only asking you to meet me half way. Don’t be surprised
if I drop in on you any minute… Your fun- loving Dictator.</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: Hail, hail, Freedonia… Land of the brave and
free!</p>
<p><strong>zeppo</strong>: My dad is much too great for his position
without a question. I’d like to offer this with your permission as a
suggestion: I really think he should be king!</p>

king and then everything went wrong.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. teasdale</strong>: The king can do no wrong!</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: The king can do no wrong! The king can do no
wrong!</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Of course you’re All aware a king must have
an heir some one to pass the family name along will some one tell me
where I’d ever get an heir if a king can do no wrong</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: The king can do no wrong!</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Suppose a pretty dame Into my castle came -
And let us say that I was going strong. She might be stuck on me, but
what good would it be, if the king can do no wrong.</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: The king can do to wrong!</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: King Solomon was game he gave each Girl his
name to number them would make a list that long I’ll bet his thousand
wives led miserable lives if the king can do no wrong.</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: We really think he should be king and wear a
crown and everything.</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: They think I should - They think I should -
They think I should - They think I should be king.</p>
<p>****: Mrs. Teasdale rises.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. teasdale</strong>: My dear friends, in time of peace we
should forgive those who fought against us, and so, I have invited our
former enemies.</p>

second helping… waiter…</p>

indigestion…</p>

fellows, generous to a fault, his own worst enemy and a devil in his own
hometown…</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Thanks, I didn’t expect to be called upon…
However, in conclusion I want to tell you that I promised Mrs. Teasdale
I’d marry her if we won the war…. Well, we won the war and I’m stuck… to
the victor belongs the spoils…</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: In union there is strength…</p>

right direction, and that’s what I call balling the Jack…</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: Now is not the time for political
temporizing, all interests must be sacrificed for the common weal…</p>
<p><strong>groucho</strong>: All those who want to place their money on
the wheel, step inside, faint heart never won fair lady… Money won’t
grow in your pocket like the hair on your head and now is the time for
all good men to come to the aid of their party.</p>
