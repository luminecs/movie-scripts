<h1 id="mulholland-drive">mulholland-drive</h1>
<p><strong>dark-haired woman</strong>: What are you doing? You don’t
stop here …</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Get out of the car.</p>
<p><strong>detective harry mcknight</strong>: You feel it?</p>
<p><strong>detective neal domgaard</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>detective neal domgaard</strong>: Sammy thinks the Caddy had
stopped along the shoulder … man up the road said he saw two cars drag
racin’…then you got that blind corner.</p>
<p><strong>detective harry mcknight</strong>: Two men… two guns in the
Caddy.</p>
<p><strong>detective neal domgaard</strong>: The boys found this on the
floor in back of the Caddy.</p>
<p><strong>detective harry mcknight</strong>: Yeah, they showed me</p>
<p><strong>detective neal domgaard</strong>: Could be unrelated.</p>
<p><strong>detective harry mcknight</strong>: Could be…any of those dead
kids wearin’ pearl earrings?</p>
<p><strong>detective neal domgaard</strong>: No. Could be someone’s
missin’ maybe.</p>
<p><strong>detective harry mcknight</strong>: That’s what I’m
thinkin’.</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: Why did you want to go to breakfast if you’re
not hungry?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I just wanted to come here.</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: To Denny’s? I wasn’t going to say anything,
but why Denny’s?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: This Denny’s.</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: Okay. Why this Denny’s?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: It’s kind of embarrassing but,</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I had a dream about this place.</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: Oh boy.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: You see what I mean…</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: Okay, so you had a dream about this place.
Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Well … it’s the second one I’ve had, but they
were both the same……they start out that I’m in here but it’s not day or
night. It’s kinda half night, but it looks just like this except for the
light, but I’m scared like I can’t tell ya. Of all people you’re
standing right over there by that counter. You’re in both dreams and
you’re scared. I get even more frightened when I see how afraid you are
and then I realize what it is - there’s a man…in back of this place.
He’s the one … he’s the one that’s doing it. I can see him through the
wall. I can see his face and I hope I never see that face ever outside a
dream.</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: So, you came to see if he’s out there?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: To get rid of this god-awful feeling.</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: Right then.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Around here.</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: Dan! … Dan! You all right? … Dan!</p>
<p><strong>old lady</strong>: It’s time to say goodbye, Betty. It’s been
so nice travelling with you.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Thank you, Irene. I was so excited and
nervous. It was sure great to have you to talk to.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Now, remember I’ll be watching for you on the
big screen.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Okay Irene. Won’t that be the day.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: The best of luck to you, Betty. Take care of
yourself and be careful.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Okay I will. Thanks again.</p>
<p><strong>cab driver</strong>: Where to?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: 1612 Havenhurst.</p>
<p><strong>cab driver</strong>: Got it!</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Hi there…ten bucks says you’re Betty.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I am, Mrs. Lanois. It is Mrs. Lanois isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lanois</strong>: In all my living glory, baby.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Pleased to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lanois</strong>: You can call me Coco … everybody does.
Stay there, I’ll get the key.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Okay, Coco.</p>
<p><strong>coco</strong>: I guess it was your grandfather, was it … he
called me to check in, said you were on your way and for you to call
when you get in. Nice man… farmer I hear.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Yes, he is. He raises corn.</p>
<p><strong>coco</strong>: Damn lot of corn raised in Hollywood these
days too.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Well, I …</p>
<p><strong>coco</strong>: You don’t have to tell me. It’s written all
over that pretty face of yours.. You came here to be an actress. I just
hope you’ll remember there’s never been a great poem called “tits and
ass.”</p>
<p><strong>coco</strong>: You probably don’t remember her, but Louise
Bonner lives right over there in number 29. When she isn’t drunk she
runs a damn good acting class.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Have many famous actors and actresses lived
here? I was meaning to ask you that.</p>
<p><strong>coco</strong>: Honey, all the great ones came through here at
one time or another.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I guess I’ve come to quite a place.</p>
<p><strong>coco</strong>: Sweetheart, you don’t know the half of it.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: No, I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>coco</strong>: That’s good. They’re allowed, but I don’t like
’em…for obvious reasons. One man used to live here that had a prize
fighting kangaroo. You wouldn’t believe what that kangaroo did to this
courtyard … let’s see your Aunt’s apartment … it’s a good one.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I can hardly wait, Coco.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: It’s unbelievable!</p>
<p><strong>coco</strong>: I told ya.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Wow!</p>
<p><strong>coco</strong>: Now I guess you and your Aunt have an
understanding. So here’s the key and you need anything, just give a
holler. Everybody in this building’s pretty much okay with me or they
wouldn’t be here. If you want, later I’ll introduce you around. No hard
feelings if you don’t, and don’t forget the rooftop garden. It’s just up
the stairs we passed. It’s open to all the tenants. You can see the
Hollywood sign from there.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Oh Coco thank you. Thank you so much.</p>
<p><strong>coco</strong>: You got it! See you later honey.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Oh my!</p>
<p><strong>dark-haired woman</strong>: That’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I’m Ruth’s niece. My name’s Betty. I’m sure
she told you I was coming.</p>
<p><strong>dark-haired woman</strong>: There was an accident. I came
here.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I understand. I saw the dress. I…I’m sorry.
Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>dark-haired woman</strong>: A car … a car accident.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>dark-haired woman</strong>: I think so. I was just taking a
shower.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Oh my god. I’m sorry. I’ll let you get back
to that. I’m going to get unpacked.</p>
<p><strong>dark-haired woman</strong>: My name is Rita.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Hi…do you work with my Aunt?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: No ……….I.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I…I mean……I…it’s none of my business.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: She has pretty red hair… she is very kind I
think.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: She sure is. She’s letting me stay here while
she’s working on a movie that’s being made in Canada, but I guess you
know that. I couldn’t afford a place like this in a million years.
Unless of course I’m discovered and become a movie star. Of course, I’d
rather be known as a great actress than a movie star, but sometimes
people end up being both and that is, I guess you’d say, sort of why I
came here. I’m sorry, I’m just so excited to be here..I mean I just came
here from Iowa and now I’m in this dream place. You can imagine how I
feel.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I think I’ve been hurt.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Oh…</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: But, this could be serious.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: No…I need to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: If you have a concussion you shouldn’t
sleep.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: It will be okay if I sleep. I need to lie down
and sleep.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: All right, but…I’m going to check on you.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: So man, that’s unheard of … an accident like
that … who coulda foreseen that.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Unreal … so, you’re looking good. Whatcha doin’
these days?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Well, not much Ed. Just doin’ some stuff for
this guy.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Making ends meet, huh.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Hardly.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Yeah, look at my digs … times are tough.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Oh, things aren’t so bad. Gee, I hope you’re
not goin’ to get in any trouble.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: It was just a thing. The story made you
laugh.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Yeah, that’s a funny story.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Yeah, the history of the world in phone
numbers.</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: What the hell …. what happened? What’s this
cord doing here? It’s the vacuum. It’s the vacuum what did it.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: So what’s the problem?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: There is no problem.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: So why did you idiots bring me here? … I’m in
the middle of making a picture.</p>
<p><strong>mr. darby</strong>: What was it last time?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: He isn’t gonna like it.</p>
<p><strong>mr. darby</strong>: We’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Hello … who’re we talkin’ about here?</p>
<p><strong>robert smith</strong>: You see Adam… there are some
suggestions which are to be brought forward … and I know you said you
would entertain suggestions and that’s all anybody here is asking you to
do.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: What’re you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>robert smith</strong>: An open mind … You’re in the process
of re-casting your lead actress and I’m… We’re asking you to keep an
open mind.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Ah… the Castigliane brothers. Let me introduce
you around … please … sit down. … this is Mr. Darby whom you know and
this is the director Adam Kesher and his manager Robert Smith</p>
<p><strong>mr. darby</strong>: May I offer you gentlemen anything?</p>
<p><strong>luigi castigliane</strong>: Espresso.</p>
<p><strong>vincenzo castigliane</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Uh what’s the photo for?</p>
<p><strong>mr. darby</strong>: One espresso … no, that’s it. I think
you’re going to enjoy your espresso this time… I’ve been doing quite a
bit of research knowing how hard you are to please… this one comes
highly recommended.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: What’s the photo for?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: A recommendation… a recommendation to you
Adam.</p>
<p><strong>vincenzo castigliane</strong>: Not a recommendation.</p>
<p><strong>luigi castigliane</strong>: This is the girl.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: What girl? For what? What is this Ray?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: We’d be happy to put her in the pile for
considerations … you’d be pleased to know there’s quite a lot of
interest in this role.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Interest?! There’s six of the top actresses
that want this thing.</p>
<p><strong>luigi castigliane</strong>: This is the girl.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Ray…you better take care of this.</p>
<p><strong>robert smith</strong>: Hold on … hold on, Adam.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Hold on!!!!!!!! There’s no way, there’s no
way!!!</p>
<p><strong>luigi castigliane</strong>: Napkin.</p>
<p><strong>espresso man</strong>: Pardon?</p>
<p><strong>luigi castigliane</strong>: Napkin.</p>
<p><strong>espresso man</strong>: Of course. Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>luigi castigliane</strong>: Is shit!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I’m sorry. That was a highly recommended…</p>
<p><strong>mr. darby</strong>: That’s considered one of the finest
espressos in the world , Sir.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Wait a minute!! What’s going on here?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: There’s no way that girl is in my movie!</p>
<p><strong>luigi castigliane</strong>: That is the girl.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Hey!!!!! That girl is not in my film!!!</p>
<p><strong>vincenzo castigliane</strong>: It is no longer your film.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: You’d better fix this, Ray!!!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I’ll speak to someone.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: And you’d better speak to someone too … or
find yourself another client!! This smells like a set-up to me! And by
the way, Ray, I don’t know who these guys are kidding, but every foot of
film I’ve shot is in a vault at the lab that only I can access. No one’s
getting that film!!</p>
<p><strong>robert smith</strong>: This is a catastrophe… you told me
they might insist on a girl, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Why didn’t you tell me, Robert? That’s what I
mean … you set me up! I woulda never come here. I’m leaving. I’m a
director you don’t want to lose … you guys better fix this!!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Well…I didn’t know that was going to
happen.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Did the Castigliane brothers get out of that
limo?</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: They two guys in dark suits?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Castigliane brothers?</p>
<p><strong>limo driver</strong>: Beat it!</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: No Grandpa, you wouldn’t believe it. It’s
more beautiful than I ever dreamed … no she left me a lot of food. The
refrigerator’s full … Aunt Ruthie said she’d call me when she got
settled… it was real smooth. I sat next to a lady who gave up her first
class seat to a boy with a broken leg. She was so nice to me. She
invited me to her house sometime. It’s in Bel Air which is a place where
people have a lot of money… I will. Everybody’s telling me to be
careful, but I sure love it here Grandpa. Thank you for helping me get
here … yeah, it’s long distance. I love you. Say hello to Grams. Give
her a big kiss for me. Okay, I love you Grandpa … bye.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I’m… sorry. I …</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: What is it Rita?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I’m…I’m… oh no… I thought when I woke up… I
thought sleep would do it …</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I don’t know who I am.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: What do you mean? You’re Rita.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I’m not. I don’t know what my name is. I don’t
know who I am!!</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: This is your purse. Your name must be in your
purse.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I … yes, but … I …</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Open it!</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Who is it please?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Raymond Harris … 20743.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: You may go right in, Ray.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Good afternoon Mr. Roque. .</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I know they said…</p>
<p><strong>mr. roque</strong>: Then?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Then… I guess it’s so …. alright, but that
means we should …</p>
<p><strong>mr. roque</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Shut everything down … Is that something
that…do you want us to shut everything down?</p>
<p><strong>limo driver</strong>: The other car is here sirs. Please
allow me.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Yeah, sure. Look what happened to them.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: No, no, no, I told you. They’re fine. They’re
all real happy.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: My next delivery is up that way, so I’ll be
getting down to it real soon.</p>

all.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: What’s the matter now?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Nothing… I don’t like being out in the open
like this.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: It must be just so pathetic being you. Sure
Billy, grab your dog we’ll eat in the van.</p>
<p><strong>laney</strong>: Not here…no thanks.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Not a coke or anything?</p>
<p><strong>laney</strong>: No … thanks though… I’ll take a cigarette if
you have one.</p>

<p><strong>laney</strong>: No. I haven’t seen any.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: A brunette? … maybe beat up?</p>
<p><strong>laney</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: You’ll keep your eyes open for me won’t you
baby?</p>
<p><strong>laney</strong>: Sure.</p>

<p><strong>rita</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Well … if you don’t remember anything, I mean
what goes through your mind then if you don’t remember anything?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Nothing. I do remember the car crash… I told
you… I remember the glass … I think about that sometimes … I remember
walking here, sort of. Now I remember this place and you. That’s about
it.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: How do you remember how to talk?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: You don’t remember anything else?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: No There is something…something there I can’t

<p><strong>betty</strong>: The money. You don’t know where it came
from?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Unh, unh.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: When you think about them… the money… the key
… does it make you remember anything?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: The money… I don’t know about the money… the
key… it makes me feel … afraid.</p>

<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: You’ve got to talk to Ray you’ve got to fix
this.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I’m going home.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Home! Meet me at the office. We’ve got to
do something … you’ve got to do something Adam!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I’m going home Cynthia.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Adam, this isn’t like you. Please come to
the office. There must be something we can do.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I’m going home. I’ll call you later.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I wonder where you were going.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Mulholland Drive.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Mulholland Drive?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: That’s where I was going… Mulholland
Drive.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Maybe that’s where the accident was. There
must be a police report. We could call.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: No…. I don’t…</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: We could call anonymously from a pay phone…
just to see if there was an accident.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Okay… but just…just to see.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Just to see if there was an accident on
Mulholland Drive.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Come on… let’s find you something to
wear.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: It’s terrible … My Aunt dresses like Miss
Marple. She’s kind of a frumpy woman detective in British movies.</p>
<p><strong>japanese gardener</strong>: Ah, Mister … you remember me. I
am Taka. your gardener. For long time I not see you. I pleased to see
you.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Hello Taka. It’s ’cause I’m never home in the
day time. It’s good to see you again. The garden looks great.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Lorraine… Lorraine … you home?</p>
<p><strong>lorraine</strong>: Now, you’ve done it!</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Just forget you ever saw it. It’s better that
way.</p>
<p><strong>lorraine</strong>: What the hell are you even doing here?</p>
<p><strong>lorraine</strong>: That bastard!</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: He’s probably upset Lorraine.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: That’s not a way to treat your wife, buddy. I
don’t care what she’s done.</p>
<p><strong>lorraine</strong>: Throw him out!</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Hollywood Police Department please.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Is this an emergency?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: No, no, I just want the number.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Hold for the number.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Hollywood Police Department</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I’m inquiring about an accident that happened
last night on Mulholland Drive.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Hold please. I’ll connect you to traffic.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant baxter</strong>: Traffic. Sergeant Baxter
speaking.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Hi. I’m inquiring …well, I heard a sound last
night that sounded like a car crash and I want to know if there was an
accident on Mulholland Drive.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant baxter</strong>: Yes, there was.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Can you tell me what happened?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant baxter</strong>: No. I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Was anyone hurt?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant baxter</strong>: May I have your name please?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: There was an accident. He wouldn’t tell me
anything else, but that was your accident Rita. I just know it was.
Maybe there’s something about it in the papers. Come on I’ll buy you a
cup of coffee and we can see.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: There’s nothing?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Not that I can see.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: You’re welcome. Will that be all? You want
your check?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Just the coffee. Rita, you want
something?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: No. Just the coffee.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: We’ll take our check.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Shhhh.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Thank you. Come in again.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: You’re welcome. We will.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I remember something… I remember
something!</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Diane Selwyn. Maybe it’s my name.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Strange to be calling yourself.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Maybe it’s not me.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Call the number.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Hi … this is me. Leave me a
message.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: It’s not my voice … but I know her.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Maybe the voice isn’t Diane Selwyn. Maybe
that’s your roommate or if it is Diane Selwyn she can tell you who you
are.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Maybe…maybe … maybe.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: Adam Kesher…he…</p>
<p><strong>lorraine</strong>: Yeah, right … get lost!</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: This is Adam Kesher’s house. Where…</p>
<p><strong>lorraine</strong>: Like hell it is! Get out … NOW!!!</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: I guess you don’t understand English. She
asked to leave. Here’s the door.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: It’s right about here on Sierra Bonita.
That’s not too far away.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: What’s wrong with that?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I’m not sure about this.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I know you’re afraid of something. We’ll be
careful. Tomorrow we’ll go over there and we’ll find out.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: It’ll be okay.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Where is Ruth?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Ruth’s gone on a film. I’m her niece Betty.
Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Someone is in trouble. Who are you? Why are
you in Ruth’s apartment?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I’m her niece. She’s letting me stay here. My
name is Betty.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: No it isn’t. That’s not it. That’s not what
she said. Something bad’s happening. Where’s Ruth?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I’m sorry, but I don’t know who you are and
I’m…</p>
<p><strong>coco</strong>: Louise… what’re are you doing Louise?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Where have you been Coco? God, I’ve been
trying to find you all afternoon since 3:00 o’clock. That one is in my
room and she won’t leave. I want you to get her out. I want you to get
her out now.</p>
<p><strong>coco</strong>: This is Louise Bonner. I’m sure she meant
well. This is Betty, Ruth’s niece. In fact and fortunately I was just
coming to see Betty. Betty’s a young actress and I’m delivering faxed
pages of a scene for her audition tomorrow. Here they are honey. Now
come along Louise and I’ll take you home. Sorry about this. Sometimes it
happens.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: No, she said it was someone else in
trouble.</p>
<p><strong>coco</strong>: Stop it, Louise. Let’s get you home …
goodnight Betty.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Whoa!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Yes…what is it?</p>
<p><strong>hotel manager</strong>: I’m sorry Mr. Kesher, but there seems
to be some problem concerning your credit card.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: … What??</p>
<p><strong>hotel manager</strong>: The fact is Mr. Kesher a
representative of your bank called us.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: How… how’d they know I was here?</p>
<p><strong>hotel manager</strong>: I don’t know. All we do is take an
impression of the credit card and until you check out it just sits in
our files.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: So, what did they say?</p>
<p><strong>hotel manager</strong>: Well, Sir, I’m afraid they said
you’re overdrawn at your bank and your line of credit has been
cancelled.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Unbelievable. Look… here. I don’t know what’s
going on. That’s so much baloney. I’ve got enough cash for one night,
okay?</p>
<p><strong>hotel manager</strong>: That’s fine, Mr. Kesher. You can pay
cash when you check out. I’m sorry. it was my duty to inform you.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Fine. I’ll check out in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>hotel manager</strong>: Have a good evening, Mr. Kesher.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Someone’s shut off my money!</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: I know. Where are you Adam?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: What do you mean “you know”?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Someone called me. When they couldn’t get
you they told me you were as good as broke. I didn’t believe then, so I
made some calls.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: You’re broke!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: But I’m not broke.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: I know, but you’re broke. Where are
you?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Beverly Hills Hotel. I’ve got enough cash in
my pocket for one night.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Do you know somebody called the The
Cowboy?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: The Cowboy??</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Yeah, the Cowboy. This guy, the Cowboy,
wants to see you. Jason said he thought it would be a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Oh, Jason thought it would be a good idea for
me to meet the Cowboy. Should I wear my ten gallon hat and my six
shooters?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Something tells me this guy is connected
with what’s happening, Adam, and I think you should do it and I think
you should do it right away.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Cynthia…what’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: It’s been a very strange day.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: And getting stranger. Where do I meet this
Cowboy? I mean do I have to ride out to the range?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Sort of, funny boy. If I tell him the
meeting’s on you’re to go to the top of Beachwood Canyon. There’s a
corral up there where he’ll be.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: You gotta be kidding?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Will you meet with him?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Yeah, sure. It is that kind of a day.
When?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: I’ll call him, then call you back…If you
want you could stay at my place.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Cynthia… that would not be a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: I’m just offering a place to stay.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I understand, Cynthia and thank you for the
offer. I’ll find a place. Now go ahead and give the Cowboy a yodel and
get back to me.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Okay, but you don’t know what you’re
missing.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Git along little dowgie and call me back.</p>
<p><strong>cowboy</strong>: Howdy!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Howdy to you.</p>
<p><strong>cowboy</strong>: Beautiful night.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>cowboy</strong>: Sure want to thank ya for drivin’ all the
way up to see me from that Beverly Hills Hotel.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: No problem. What’s on your mind?</p>
<p><strong>cowboy</strong>: Well now, here’s a man who wants to get
right to it. Kinda anxious to get to it are ya?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Whatever.</p>
<p><strong>cowboy</strong>: A man’s attitude … a man’s attitude goes
some ways toward how a man’s life will be. Is that somethin’ you agree
with?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>cowboy</strong>: Now… did you answer cause you thought that’s
what I wanted to hear or did you think about what I said and answer
cause you truly believe that to be right?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I agree with what you said…truly.</p>
<p><strong>cowboy</strong>: What did I say?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: That a man’s attitude determines to a large
extent how his life will be.</p>
<p><strong>cowboy</strong>: So since you agree I guess you could be a
person who does not care about the good life.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: How’s that?</p>
<p><strong>cowboy</strong>: Well, just stop for a little second and
think about it. Will ya do that for me?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Okay, I’m thinking.</p>
<p><strong>cowboy</strong>: No. You’re too busy being a smart aleck to
be thinkin’. Now I want ya to think and quit bein’ such a smart aleck.
Can ya do that for me?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Look … where’s this going? What do you want me
to do?</p>
<p><strong>cowboy</strong>: There’s sometimes a buggy. How many drivers
does a buggy have?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: One.</p>
<p><strong>cowboy</strong>: So let’s just say I’m drivin’ this buggy and
you fix your attitude and you can ride along with me.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>cowboy</strong>: Now I know a few things. I know you have had
a rough day. You’re probably thinkin’ I don’t know the half of it, but
in actual fact I know every part of it. The business of gittin’ thrown
off your movie, the heartache of seeing your wife with another man…
losin’ access to that precious film vault…</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: It will work out.</p>
<p><strong>cowboy</strong>: Good then, but, just in case, that bank’s
gonna stay closed a bit longer. You understand that?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>cowboy</strong>: You’re an understandin’ fella.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: So, this is the last time I see you then
unless I do bad?</p>
<p><strong>cowboy</strong>: No, this one doesn’t count. It’s part of the
original one. So then … until we meet again.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: “You’re still here?”</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: “I came back. I thought that’s what you
wanted.”</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: “Nobody wants you here!”</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: “Really?”</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: “My parents are right upstairs! They think
you’ve left…”</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: “So… surprise”…</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: “I can call them… I can call my dad…”</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: “But you won’t…”</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: “You’re playing a dangerous game here. If
you’re trying to blackmail me… it’s not going to work.”</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: “You know what I want…it’s not that
difficult.”</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: “Get out! Get out before I call my dad … he
trusts you … your his best friend. This will be the end of
everything…”</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: “What about you? What will your dad think
about you?”</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: “Stop! Just Stop! That’s what you said from
the beginning. If I tell what happened… they’ll arrest you and put you
in jail, so get out of here before…”</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: “Before what?”</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: “Before I kill you.”</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: “Then they’d put you in jail.”</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Cry, cry, cry, and then I say with big
emotion, “I hate you… I hate us both!”</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: But you are really good.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Thank you dahling!</p>
<p><strong>coco</strong>: Hello … Ruthie… How’s the great up north? …
Oh, I’m sorry to hear it … what? Well, I haven’t seen her if she’s in
there. Now, Ruthie there’s nothing to worry about. I saw Betty last
night and she was just fine. Yes, and I gave them to her. She’s a real
nice kid, Ruthie. Now stop worrying, will ya. I’ll go over and have a
look around. I will. I’ve got the production office number. I’ll find
you. Now keep your socks on up there and take lots of “C.” Goodbye
honey.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Oh, no wonder I’m starving. I’m going to fix
a sandwich. You want one?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I’m all right.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: You’ve got to eat something. You’re just
nervous about going over to see if you’re Diane Selwyn.</p>
<p><strong>coco</strong>: Hi! Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Uh…Betty!?</p>
<p><strong>coco</strong>: Can I see you outside a minute Betty?</p>
<p><strong>coco</strong>: Your Aunt called me.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I was afraid of that.</p>
<p><strong>coco</strong>: She wants to know who’s staying in her
apartment.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: It’s just for a night or two, until she finds
her own place. I tried to explain that to Aunt Ruth, but the connection
was bad and her plane was leaving and she got it all mixed up. I kept
telling her it was my friend and she kept saying she didn’t know any
Ritas …</p>
<p><strong>coco</strong>: Sweetie, look at me straight.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Coco…she’s very nice. We went to school
together.</p>
<p><strong>coco</strong>: So I guess your Grandpa and Grandma know
her.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Not really. I met her in junior college and
she was from this other town.</p>
<p><strong>coco</strong>: Honey… I was married to a director for thirty
years. He had an uncanny ability to read people. Maybe some of it rubbed
off on me or maybe I had it all along … you’re a good kid… What you’re
telling me is a load of horse - pucky but it comes from a good place.
I’ll trust you to sort this out. Now I’m not going against Ruth. She’s
got enough to worry about up there in Canada. If she asks- I’m going to
say everything is okay, and you make sure it is. Betty’s shoulder and
squeezes If you need any help you know where to find me.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: You’re really something Coco…thank you.</p>
<p><strong>coco</strong>: Don’t make me out to be a sucker. Louise
Bonner says there’s trouble in there. You remember last night. Sometimes
she’s wrong, but if there is trouble - get rid of it.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Is everything all right? Is it bad for you
that I’m here?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Everything is A-okay, but I’ve gotta get that
sandwich!</p>
<p><strong>detective harry mcknight</strong>: Nice wallets.</p>
<p><strong>detective neal domgaard</strong>: Handstitched Italian.
Filled with phony credit cards … off the two guys in the Caddy.</p>
<p><strong>detective harry mcknight</strong>: The one of ’em still
alive?</p>
<p><strong>detective neal domgaard</strong>: Yeah… just …. Dr. Scott’s
got ’im. You remember Dr.Scott.</p>
<p><strong>detective harry mcknight</strong>: Oh yeah.</p>
<p><strong>detective neal domgaard</strong>: Well he said… you know in
his way… you know what I mean? Besides the guy gettin’ rolled up under
the kids car which busted him up pretty bad, there was this little
knife-like torn piece of metal, you know, off the car body, rolled out
and slid up through this guy’s neck and just kinda slit his aorta, you
know, but they didn’t find it right away, so the guy’s losin’ a lot of
blood, you know, to the brain - all this time cause it was just like
this thin little puncture wound on the surface of his neck that kinda
sealed itself, he said, while inside the aorta is bleedin’ pretty steady
all that time. So, Dr. Scott’s laughin’ you know like he does ‘cause he
knows we want to talk to this guy. He’s laughin’ you know and shakin’…
Son of a bitch couldn’t stop laughin’… It was kinda contagious ‘cause
pretty soon we were all laughin’…the nurse was laughin’. You know how he
is.</p>
<p><strong>detective harry mcknight</strong>: Find out who they are?</p>
<p><strong>detective neal domgaard</strong>: Nope, not yet. Their
fingerprints don’t match up anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>detective harry mcknight</strong>: Interesting.</p>
<p><strong>detective neal domgaard</strong>: Yeah … and they both use
the same address.</p>
<p><strong>detective harry mcknight</strong>: Where at?</p>
<p><strong>detective neal domgaard</strong>: Palmdale.</p>
<p><strong>detective harry mcknight</strong>: Damn, that’s a long
drive.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I hope I’m back in a couple of hours. Don’t
drink all the coke.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Good luck!</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: When I get back I’ll have the cab waiting, so
be ready to go.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Sorry to trouble you, Coco.</p>
<p><strong>coco</strong>: It’s all right gorgeous. Something wrong?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: No, no. I’m on my way to my audition. Before
I go I wanted to ask you if you could remember the man’s name … Aunt
Ruthie’s friend who helped put this together. It completely went out of
my mind.</p>
<p><strong>coco</strong>: His name’s Wally Brown …. great guy. Been in
the business since forever.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Thanks Coco. It’d be so embarrassing</p>
<p><strong>coco</strong>: Naw! He wouldn’t have cared. Just give him a
good performance and he’ll be happy and I’ve got a feeling you’ll do
just that.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Thanks Coco. I’ll let you know.</p>
<p><strong>coco</strong>: Get going. You don’t want to be late.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Right. See ya.</p>
<p><strong>coco</strong>: Good luck, honey!</p>

with themselves, so don’t play it for real until it gets real.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Just tell me where it hurts, baby.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I want to play this one close, Bob. Like it

good. Whaddya think?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: That’d be good, Jimmy. Just don’t rush that
line again. I told you… the line where you say, “Before what?”</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I was playin’ off ’em. They say, “They’ll
arrest you”… and stuff like that.. “put you in jail”… they say it like
that. They all say it the same way, so I react like that.</p>

it. We play it close, just like in the movies.</p>

<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You know what I want…it’s not that
difficult.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Get out… Get out before I call my dad. He
trusts you… you’re his best friend. This will be the end of
everything.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: What about you? What will your dad think

<p><strong>betty</strong>: Stop… just stop! That’s what you said from
the beginning. If I tell what happened… they’ll arrest you and put you

himself Before what?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Before I kill you.</p>

<p><strong>betty</strong>: I hate you… I hate us both!</p>

<p><strong>bob</strong>: Very good. Really. I mean it was forced maybe
but still humanistic. Yeah, very good, really.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: Well, thank you Betty, and I mean that. That
was very impressive. You’ve done your Aunt proud and I’m going to tell
her the first chance I get. We’ll speak again soon I’m sure, and thank
you so much for coming in.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Well, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>sarah james</strong>: Thank you, Wally. I’m sure you all have
a lot to talk about. We’ll walk Betty out.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: Well, yes indeed. Our pleasure, Sarah, and
don’t you be a stranger. We’d love to see you around here again real
soon.</p>
<p><strong>sarah james</strong>: Well come along, Betty.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Thank you again, Mr. Brown. It was nice
meeting all of you.</p>
<p><strong>sarah james</strong>: Oh God, that was awful!</p>
<p><strong>nicki</strong>: How about that Jimmy Katz?</p>
<p><strong>sarah james</strong>: Oh god! Jimmy Katz never had a day.
Jimmy Katz never had a minute. Poor Wally.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: They seem very nice to me, and Wally…
Mr. Brown is a very close friend of my Aunt’s, so. . .</p>
<p><strong>sarah james</strong>: Settle down, Betty. Don’t get me wrong.
I love Wally. I ought to. I was married to him for ten years.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Cut it!</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Oh, man, are you kidding? I love this script!
Where do I sign?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Look… I love you, but there’s no way they’re
gonna let me cast this thing until I’ve seen everyone. I’ll let you know
as soon as I can.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: I know you will … cause my manager’s gonna
bug you day and night … me too.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: It’ll be my pleasure. Now, get out of
here.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Oh, you’re just so cruel… don’t forget me.
I’m the girl that’s going to play this part.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: See ya later.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Camilla Rhodes.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Is she ready?</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: All ready.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Bring her out.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Camilla Rhodes next!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Playback!</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Get Jason over here.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Cindy … Adam wants to see Jason.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Did you want to tell me something, Adam?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: This is the girl!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Excellent choice, Adam.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Oh … oh…I have to be somewhere. I promised a

<p><strong>betty</strong>: C’mom. There’s nothing to be afraid of.</p>
<p><strong>cornell dumont</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Sol?</p>
<p><strong>cornell dumont</strong>: No … not you… I’m sorry… I forget
your name.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Rita.</p>
<p><strong>cornell dumont</strong>: Yeah. Well, I haven’t seen Sol
lately. Tell him to come by the club.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: And what’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>cornell dumont</strong>: Cornell Dumont.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Ask him who Sol is …</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Why didn’t you ask him? Sol knows you!</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: But I don’t know, Sol. I never heard of Sol.
I’d just get in trouble. That’s why we shouldn’t go see about Diane
Selwyn… it’s better not to get in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: You’re not going to get in trouble. You’re
going to find out who you are. Finding out who you are gets you out of
trouble.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: It should be around here…</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Don’t stop!</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: What is it? What do you see?!</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Those men in front, in the car.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Do you know them?!</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: No… but…</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Keep going. Go around to the back.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Selwyn … number 12.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Oh no … don’t.</p>
<p><strong>middle-aged woman</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Diane?</p>
<p><strong>middle-aged woman</strong>: Number 17.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: But it said #12.</p>
<p><strong>middle-aged woman</strong>: I switched apartments with her.
She’s in #17. Just walk down that way. It’s just to the right.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Well … we’ll leave her a note.</p>
<p><strong>middle-aged woman</strong>: I’ll go with you. She’s still got
some of my stuff.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I guess you’re not Diane.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I don’t think…</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: C’mon help me in. I’ll open the front
door.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Rita… I know what you’re doing.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: What … I..HAVE… to do.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I know what you have to do, but let me do
it.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: You look like someone else.</p>
<p><strong>wilkins</strong>: Hello. Adam. How’s it going? No, it’s okay.
Yeah, I’m working, but… they wanted this script a week ago. What? What’s
wrong with your house? The poolman? Sure, you can have the couch. No,
it’s no problem..it’s just I gotta … I gotta work. Any chance you could
bring some food. No, I got plenty of money - I just haven’t gone out for
awhile. Groovy man!</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: You’ve been so good to me … now we know why …
why I was so afraid. We know what kind of trouble I’m in. I shouldn’t…
ask you… I only have this to offer. I’ll give you this if I can stay
here for awhile. I don’t know what else to do.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Rita… I want you to stay here and you don’t
have to give me that money.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: But I want to.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: No. We shouldn’t touch that money. We don’t
know about that money. That might be dangerous money. You have to start
all over again. You look like a brand new person and you can be a brand
new person… whoever you want to be.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: It sounds kind of nice … being somebody brand
new.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Hey, let’s introduce the brand new you to
Hollywood. We haven’t seen the roof garden yet.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Here I am Hollywood! My name’s Betty.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Here I am Hollywood! My name is … Rita.</p>
