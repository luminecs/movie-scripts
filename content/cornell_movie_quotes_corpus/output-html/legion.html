<h1 id="legion">legion</h1>
<p><strong>the mojave desert - dusk</strong>: Vast. Barren. No signs of
life. A BLOOD RED SUN is sinking behind the distant mountains. The
unbearable heat will soon become an unbearable cold. A YOUNG WOMAN’S
VOICE. Solemn. Weary. Determined.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: When I was a little girl, my mother
would remind me each night before bed to be sure to open my heart to
God, for he was kind, merciful and just. Things changed after my father
left a few years later, leaving her to raise me and my brothers alone in
a little place out on the edge of the Mojave Desert. She never talked
about a kind and merciful God again. Instead she spoke of a prophecy. Of
a time when all the world would be covered in darkness and the fate of
Mankind would be decided. One night I finally got up the courage to ask
my mother why God had changed, why was he mad at his children. “I don’t
know,” she said, tucking the covers around me, “I guess he just got
tired of all the bullshit.”</p>
<p><strong>darkness…</strong>: A darkness filled with the sounds of
SIRENS, GLASS SHATTERING, SPORADIC GUNFIRE…a CITY FALLING INTO
CHAOS.</p>
<p><strong>title</strong>: “Los Angeles, December 23rd - 1:02 a.m.”</p>
<p><strong>a blood red moon</strong>: reflected in a greasy puddle of
water. Might just be the smog that’s making it that ominous color. Then
we notice something moving in the reflection. A dark shape, growing,
coming down at us fast. Beat…then WHAM!</p>
<p><strong>two black boots</strong>: land hard in the water…and we’re
in:</p>
<p><strong>what are unmistakably…the shadow of wings.</strong>: The RAIN
POUNDS harder, as if punishment from the heavens. The glint of the KNIFE
coming down fast.</p>
<p><strong>…followed by michael’s ungodly scream rising up from
the</strong>: ALLEY WAY. And then SILENCE…</p>
<p><strong>fresh. bloody.</strong>: He threads a needle not with thread,
but with FISHING WIRE, and begins to STITCH the wounds closed. BLOOD
POOLS on the cement floor around his feet.</p>
<p><strong>burton</strong>: Goddamn’ animals. Nights like this I wish I
could take a match to this city just so I could watch all these
motherfuckers burn.</p>
<p>****: A good ol’ boy barbecue, huh?</p>
<p><strong>burton</strong>: A fresh start. That’s what this place
needs.</p>
<p><strong>burton</strong>: Pow! Pow! Pow!</p>
<p><strong>estevez</strong>: Jesus… You know Burton, I’m so happy we get
to share beautiful moments like this. They really brighten my da–</p>
<p><strong>estevez</strong>: Freeze!</p>
<p><strong>estevez</strong>: Drop the bags! Hands on your head!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: It’s starting. There isn’t much time.</p>
<p><strong>burton</strong>: Shut the fuck up and drop the bags now!</p>
<p><strong>estevez</strong>: Hands on your head! On your head!</p>
<p><strong>burton</strong>: Turn around! Turn the fuck around!</p>
<p><strong>burton</strong>: Let `em go!</p>
<p><strong>estevez</strong>: Take the shot, Burton!</p>
<p><strong>burton</strong>: I said let `em fuckin’ g-g-g-g–</p>
<p><strong>estevez</strong>: Burton!?</p>
<p><strong>clown!</strong>: His eyes SNAP OPEN, focused, the force
inside him now fully in control. Burton looks at Michael with calm
recognition, his voice GUTTURAL..INHUMAN. A man possessed.</p>
<p><strong>burton</strong>: What are you doing, Michael? These weren’t
your orders.</p>
<p><strong>estevez</strong>: What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I’m following my own orders now.</p>
<p><strong>burton</strong>: Then you will die along with the child.</p>
<p><strong>estevez</strong>: Burton, you fuckin’ know this guy?!</p>
<p><strong>jeep hanson</strong>: Bolts awake. Breathing hard. Covered
with sweat.</p>
<p><strong>“paradise falls gas `n’ grub”</strong>: A beat as Jeep
contemplates the sign.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You okay, Jeep?</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: Sorry to wake you, Charlie.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: trailer, hands on her</p>
<p>****: Wasn’t you. He’s been kickin’ up a storm all night. Must know
somethin’ I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Another bad dream?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: It’s just stress, Jeep, that’s all. You do
too much worryin’. About this place. About your dad.</p>
<p>****: About me…</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: You’re the only thing I like worrying
about.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: See what I mean? You’re worried about a
girl eight months pregnant and it isn’t even your baby. Now that’s
enough to give anybody nightmares.</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: Go ahead, make fun of me. Everybody else
does.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: C’mon, I was only kiddin’. You know how
much I appreciate everything you and Bob are doing for me, but a month
from now, this baby’ll have a new family and I’ll have to start thinkin’
about what the hell I’m doin’ with my life.</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: So you’re still going through with it…?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Jeep, I’m not ready to be a mama. Christ, I
can barely take care of myself as it is.</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: I could help you. We could do it together, you
know? I want to.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You gotta stop carryin’ the weight of the
world on your shoulders.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Now can we go back in? I’m freezing my ass
off out here.</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: Go on. I’ll be right there.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy stewart</strong>: I don’t know whether I like it very
much being seen around with an angel without any wings.</p>
<p><strong>it’s a wonderful life playing on a crummy tv</strong>: Jimmy
Stewart as George Bailey has just met Clarence, his guardian
angel-in-training. The signal ROLLS and SNOWS in and out. We hear a
WHACK, which causes the image to momentarily improve and then slowly
roll back the other way.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Oh, I’ve got to earn them and you’ll help
me, won’t you?</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: Lord as my witness, Bob, one of these days
that thing’s gonna hit you back.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Whaddya talkin’ about, Percy? We got a special
relationship here.</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: Yeah, they got names for that kind a
relationship.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: It’s disgusting.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: You’re right. It is disgusting.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Really, how can she go out in public wearing
that?</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: I don’t know. Why don’t we just ask her?</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Howard, don’t. You’ll embarrass me.</p>
<p>****: Audrey, honey? Your mother was wondering if you got dressed
this morning with the specific intention of showing your ass off to the
entire world?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Yeah, that’s cuz I woke up hoping to get
double teamed by a couple of meth head truckers in the bathroom of some
desert shithole.</p>
<p>****: Good thing we stopped here.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: I feel satisfied with that answer. I really
do.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: I’m being punished for something, I know
it.</p>
<p><strong>drifting over a vast expanse of western desert</strong>: The
noontime sun bakes the strip of highway slicing through this barren
country. A BLACK CADILLAC ESCALADE blazes a path. HEAVY BEATS thunder
from within.</p>
<p><strong>“entering paradise falls, next services 50 miles”</strong>:
Kyle’s expression says this is not good news. He grabs his cell phone
off the passenger seat. No signal.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Shit…</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Darren, your fuckin’ directions suck, man.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Hey…</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: You know that shit right there ain’t good for
the baby.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Guess I should think `bout quittin’
then.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Now hold on, girl, let me bum one before you
do.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You can buy a whole pack inside.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Tell ya what. You let me have one of yours,
and I’ll give you two from the new pack you’re gonna sell me.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Am I in the right place?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Only if nowhere’s right, `cause that’s
where you are.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Sonuvabitch. There another phone around here?
You know, one that works?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Bob’ll probably let you use the diner phone
if you ask him real nice…And pay `im somethin’.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: I can handle that. You got pancakes here?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Yeah, we got a buttermilk stack for three
seventy-five. We also got french toast for four dollars if you’re into
that. I personally like the pancakes though.</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: You okay, Charlie?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Yeah, I’m okay. This guy’s just lost.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Three seventy-five, huh?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I hope Salem Lights are okay, `cause that’s
all we got left.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: If I can smoke
<code>em, I'll take</code>em.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Where ya been, Charlie?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: This ain’t a resort you know. I got orders
stacking up here.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You best not be smokin’ again. Not in your
condition.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Bob, do you see where am I right now? Can
my condition really get any worse? `Sides, you ain’t one to talk.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What? I quit two years ago.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Yeah, so why you still carryin’ that fancy
lighter `round for?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: It was a gift from my ex-wife, alright? I’m
sentimental. I don’t wanna forget how much I hate her guts.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Hey man?</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Can I use your phone? My cell doesn’t get a
signal out here and the pay phone outside is busted.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Excuse me…?</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Any news about when our truck might be
fixed? You said your boy would have us on the road two hours ago. The
rate we’re going, we’ll be lucky to make it to Scottsdale by
Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Goddamn it. Where the hell is Jeep?</p>
<p><strong>a grimy piece of wood</strong>: A cloth wipes away the dirt,
revealing the partial image of an ANGEL carved into the surface.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Hey, Leonardo…!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: The fact that this truck’s hood’s up mean
anything to you?</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: Nothin’…</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: Found it under a bunch of stuff in the storage
shed. I know you never like to throw anything away…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Whaddya doin’?</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: What…?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Jeep, I like Charlie. I do. And I think it’s
real good of you to lend her a helping hand, but she is not your
responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: Oh whatever, leave me alone.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Don’t walk away from me while I’m talkin’ to
you!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: How long you gonna follow her around like a
puppy dog? Cleanin’ up the messes she makes while she steps out with
every guy around here other than you?!</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: Don’t say that about her! She’s not like
that!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You really think she’s gonna stick around here
after that baby’s born and off her hands?</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: Look, I know it doesn’t make any sense to you,
but it’s just something I have to do.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: See that up there? Your mother thought I was
crazy for wanting to buy this place, middle of nowhere…But I just knew
this was what I was supposed to do. Told your mom, “just wait.” Told her
when they finally ran the freeway through here like they were plannin’
on, this place would be like Grand Central Station.</p>
<p>****: But I was wrong. The freeway never came and now the only people
who ever stop here are the ones who are lost.</p>
<p>****: And your mom? Well she got tired of waitin’.</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: C’mon Dad. You can’t blame yourself for what
she did–</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Yeah, I can. And I’m sayin’ you’re about to
make the same damn mistake I made, believing in something that’s never
gonna happen…Or someone.</p>
<p>****: It’s time for you to move on from this place, Jeep. I don’t
wanna see you wake up one morning old and pissed off, realizing you’re
lost just like everybody else who stops here.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Now get to work on that truck. I wanna have
these people on the road by nightfall.</p>
<p>****: Yeah, wait a minute.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What’s wrong with you today?</p>
<p><strong>whack!</strong>: The image flickers but doesn’t improve.</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: I told you to get the satellite TV. But you
don’t wanna listen.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What the hell do I need that crap for?</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: History Channel, man!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I got all the history I can take.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: That’s for sure.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What’s your problem now?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Where do I start?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You know this was the top-of-the- line model
when I bought it.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Yeah, in the Fifties.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You shouldn’t be watchin’ anyways. Okay, baby,
this is gonna do it.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: See? Clear as day.</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: Nice work, Bob. What the hell’s that?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: It’s just one of those test things.</p>
<p><strong>“this is not a test”</strong>: Bob switches the channels. All
the same.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Don’t look like a test.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Yo, am I the Invisible motherfuckin’ Man here?
Do you have a phone or not?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: In the back past the kitchen. Make it fast.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: If there’s a real emergency aren’t they
supposed to give us some information about what to do?</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: I’m sure it’s a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Hey, Percy, give that old radio of yours a
shot. Maybe they got some news about the TV.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Let me talk to him…</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Cuz a father should be able to talk to his
son, that’s why. Now put `im on the phone. Is that my little man…? Yeah,
well I’m working hard, so that I can be with you. You bein’ good?</p>
<p>****: Wait… You’re breakin’ up. Hello…? Shit!</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: What the hell…</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Maybe there was an earthquake?</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: They keep sayin’ we’re overdue for a big
one.</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: Lot a folks could be hurt.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Not if it was centered in the desert.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Exactly. Could be nothing to worry
about.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: So then why’s the TV out?</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Maybe it just hit the relay stations. Aren’t
those usually in remote areas?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Yeah, `cause of the radiation they give
off.</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: There ain’t no radiation comin’ from those
things. Plus that don’t explain the radio being out too. Some of those
stations broadcast over hundreds of miles. Any quake that big and we
would a felt it.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Percy’s right. I didn’t feel nothing.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Maybe it’s a terrorist attack or
something…?</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Oh god…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Well, for cryin’ out loud. There’s no use in
speculating. I’ll just call my brother up in Needles. He must a heard
something.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Whaddya talkin’ about?</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Phone’s dead. Just tried to make a call.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You’re shittin’ me.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Oh, this is just great.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Relax, Mrs. Anderson. Nothing to get excited
about. Probably just working on the lines.</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: Damn it!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Have a seat wherever you want, Ma’am.
Specials are on the board.</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Thank you, dear.</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Oh, I already know what I want.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Okay, what’ll it be?</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: I’ll have the steak, please.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: And how’d you like that cooked?</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Rare if you would. And water, no ice.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Coming right up.</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Charlie, is it?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: What an unusual name for a girl.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: So they say. I’ll be right back with your
water.</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Hello, I’m Gladys. Gladys Foster.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Nice to meet you, Gladys. I’m Sandra and
this is my husband Howard.</p>
<p><strong>gladys</strong>: What a nice young couple you are. What
brings you out to these parts?</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: We’re moving out to Scottsdale. But our
truck broke down, and so we’re stuck here while it’s being fixed.</p>
<p><strong>gladys</strong>: Oh, what a nuisance.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Say, Gladys, it seems the lines are down
around here. The phone and TV, you know?</p>
<p><strong>gladys</strong>: Oh, don’t worry yourself about that,
sweetheart. It’ll all be over soon.</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: The carburetor’s shot. Don’t know why. Looks
brand new.</p>
<p>****: Ah, shit. They’re gonna be pissed.</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: I could try to rebuild it, but it’d take a
while, and I don’t think we have all the parts. If we call right now, we
might be able to get a new one down here tomorrow morning.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: That’s not gonna happen. Goddamn phone’s
out.</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>gladys</strong>: Thank you, dear. How far along are you?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Just about there.</p>
<p><strong>gladys</strong>: The father must be very proud.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I wouldn’t know.</p>
<p><strong>gladys</strong>: You mean he’s…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Out of sight. Out of mind.</p>
<p><strong>gladys</strong>: Oh, I see. So you’re not married, I take
it?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>gladys</strong>: That’s too bad.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: No, I prefer it that way. I don’t a need a
man tellin’ me what to do.</p>
<p><strong>gladys</strong>: But what about the baby?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’ve got it under control.</p>
<p><strong>gladys</strong>: Yeah, but it’s gonna burn.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What did you just say?</p>
<p><strong>gladys</strong>: I said your fucking baby’s gonna burn.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Go to hell, lady.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Total fucking Jesus freak.</p>
<p><strong>gladys</strong>: All those babies. They’re gonna burn.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Gladys, please. There’s no reason to –</p>
<p><strong>gladys</strong>: Shut up, you stupid fucking cunt! All you do
is complain! Complain! Complain!</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Howard, it’s okay! Don’t listen to her!</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Who the hell do you think you are, lady?!
Now, I’d like you to apologize to my –</p>
<p><strong>razor sharp teeth.</strong>: EVERYBODY FREAKS as Howard
crumbles to the floor. Gladys rockets to her feet, knocking her table
over. Blood covers her face and chest.</p>
<p><strong>gladys</strong>: You’re all going to fucking die!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Don’t move!</p>
<p><strong>wall like some kind of bizarre crab!</strong>: Bob can’t
believe his eyes. But he gets over it real fast, as the crab lady rushes
toward him – ACROSS THE CEILING –</p>
<p><strong>upside down!</strong>: BOB PUMPS THE SHOTGUN, trying to take
her down, but he can’t track her fast enough. Instead he blows ENORMOUS
HOLES in the ceiling, a rain of plaster. Gladys drops down right in
front of Bob.</p>
<p>****: Fuck!</p>
<p><strong>room!</strong>: The shotgun clatters to the floor at Jeep’s
feet. He snatches it up and aims it at Gladys who turns calmly to face
him.</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: Shoot her, Jeep!</p>
<p><strong>gladys</strong>: You’ll never save her.</p>
<p><strong>shoot the fucking bitch!</strong>: Gladys rockets straight at
him! But Jeep’s too afraid to move. He clamps his eyes shut, bracing
himself for the end.</p>
<p><strong>blam! blam! blam!</strong>: A RAIN OF BULLETS RIP INTO
GLADYS, taking her down like an animal. Jeep slowly opens his eyes. His
gun’s still cocked. Gladys lies dead in a smoldering, bloody heap at his
feet. He turns to see Kyle with smoke rising from the barrel of his
silver plated WESTERN ARMS 45. If everyone wasn’t so shocked, they’d
probably be wondering why this guy is packing such serious heat.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Somebody help me!</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Press your hands over the hole!</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Don’t look at me like that, lady! I’m tryin’
to fuckin’ help you! Now put your goddamn hands over the hole before
your husband bleeds to death!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: The fuck was that?! What the fuck was
that!?</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: How far to the hospital?</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: Seventy, maybe eighty miles.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: What’s that on the road?</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: They’re fuckin’ clouds! What the fuck do they
look like?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Not clouds. Clouds don’t buzz.</p>
<p><strong>ping! ping! ping!</strong>: Suddenly HUNDREDS OF TINY BUGS
begin to HIT the windshield –</p>
<p><strong>splat!</strong>: And that’s when they realize it… Those
aren’t clouds.</p>
<p><strong>they’re flies!</strong>: The Escalade enters the SWARM. The
car is PUMMELED by insects, the windshield instantly covered in BLACK
AND RED bug guts. Driving blind! The sound of FLIES SPLATTERING and
BUZZING is deafening! Everyone SCREAMS as hell surrounds them…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I don’t understand how she was still standin’
after Percy hit `er with that goddamn fryin’ pan. Broke her fuckin’
neck. I saw it. I swear I did.</p>
<p>****: And did you see that kid’s gun? The hell’s he doin’ with a gun
like that?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: It’s okay, Jeep. It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: I couldn’t pull the trigger. I froze. I saw
what I needed to do, but I was afraid… She could’ve killed you!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: There’s nothin’ to be ashamed of, Jeep.</p>
<p>****: Not everybody can play the hero.</p>
<p>****: Where you going?!</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: To get my bible!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: The hell you need that for?!</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: Well somebody’s gotta start prayin’…</p>
<p><strong>stop’s perimeter a few hundred yards out.</strong>:
Everything in the diner is suddenly cast in DARK RED as the day’s
remaining sunlight filters through the swarm. Apocalyptic. No one
breathes.</p>
<p><strong>a black hand and a hook tear a shirt open</strong>: Revealing
a bloody mess of muscles and tendons chewed down to the bone.</p>
<p>****: Okay, hold `em steady.</p>
<p>****: Oh god, please don’t throw up.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: She’s cold as a freakin’ ice cube. If I hadn’t
just seen her walk in here, I’d say the old bag’s been dead for
hours.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Well, I don’t care how long she’s been dead,
the bitch ain’t stayin’ in here with us.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I don’t get it. Why don’t they come closer?</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: How the fuck am I supposed to know, man? You
askin’ me to explain the behavior of a motherfuckin’ pestilence.</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: You guys!</p>
<p><strong>gladys’ cutlass supreme</strong>: Its windows are completely
caked with dust. The men WIPE AWAY a layer of brown from the glass,
allowing them to peer inside the car.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You see anything?</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: No Twilight Zone shit if that’s what you
mean.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Careful. Old lady could have some kind of rabid
poodle locked up in there.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Agh! What the fuck is that?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Nothin’ here.</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: How `bout the trunk?</p>
<p><strong>maggot infested.</strong>: Bob quickly slams the trunk
closed. The guys are reeling with disgust. Kyle’s trying to blow the
stench from his nose.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Bitch’s got motherfuckin’ dead cats in her
hoopty! What the fuck is wrong with white people?!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Least now we know where that smell was coming
from.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Yeah, it was a real motherfuckin’ necessity we
figured that out, man.</p>
<p>****: Hey…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Okay, now we’re talkin’.</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: Wait a minute. Check it out. It’s LAPD. What’s
an LA cop doing way out here?</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: I’m from Nevada, man.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Give me the shotgun.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Oh, thank God, the police!</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: Charlie, wait!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Charlie freezes a few feet from the car
when she sees those piercing eyes already familiar to us. Michael looks
at her, as if she was exactly who he expected to see. In moments Bob,
Kyle and Jeep form a protective shield in front of Charlie. Bob raises
the shotgun.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Take one step closer and I’ll drop you right
here.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: That how you greet all your customers?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Mister, after what we’ve been through here
today, you’re lucky we didn’t shoot you first and greet you later. Now
let me see your teeth.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Your teeth goddamn it! Lemme see `em!</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: No, shark teeth, Pop.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Okay… Suppose you tell us your name then.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Michael.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Sorry about all that, Michael. This old lady
just went crazy inside my place here. She had these teeth. Never seen
anything like `em. Practically bit a man in half.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: So what are you doin’ out here? Gotta say you
don’t exactly look like a police officer. Even one from L.A. Then again,
you have to be, right? I mean, who the hell’d be crazy enough to steal a
cop car?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: You don’t know, do you?</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Know what?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: We don’t know anything. Nothing’s working
here. The TV, the radio, the phone…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I’m running out of time.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Back off, fella…</p>
<p>****: Now, I don’t care if this is the second coming of Jesus fucking
Christ, I say it’s time for you to either get talkin’ or get the hell
outta here!</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Easy! Easy!</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: C’mon, Dad, tell
<code>em you're sorry. Tell</code>em you were only kidding!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Let `em go!</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: Now, son, I’m sure you don’t wanna go
spillin’ blood for no good reason in front of all these decent people,
do ya? Our friend Bob here ain’t worth the trouble it’d cause ya.</p>
<p>****: So whaddya say <code>bout just lettin'</code>im go and then you
can be on your way? Nice `n’ easy.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: What the–?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: They’re here.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: You’re going to need this.</p>
<p><strong>he begins to load gun after gun.</strong>: Percy stares out
at the lights, eyes wide.</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: Lord, have mercy.</p>
<p>****: You ladies best get back inside.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: What is it? What’s happening? Who is this
man? Why’s he driving a police car?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Shut up, mom!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Wait. I don’t think that’s such a good
idea.</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: Dad, I can handle it.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: He’s just a kid –</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: I said, I can handle it!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: He can handle it. He doesn’t have a
choice.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: If you want to live, you’ll do exactly as I
say.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: When you fire, you keep your thumb off the
slide. Don’t hesitate. Don’t do anything brave. There’s no safety.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: C’mon, Jeep. We gotta go!</p>
<p><strong>the headlights are growing brighter. closer.</strong>: He
contemplates the sub-machine gun in his hands.</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: Fuck it.</p>
<p><strong>a dead bolt</strong>: Thrown. Locking the diner door.</p>
<p><strong>the back office - continuous</strong>: Jeep races in, locks
the back door. Then he pushes a desk in front of it.</p>
<p><strong>in the diner - continuous</strong>: The place is transformed.
Locked up tight. The ROAR OF ENGINES outside grows ever LOUDER, CLOSER.
Sandra huddles on the floor with Howard, his head in her lap. She’s
running her hands gently through his hair, trying to keep calm. He opens
his eyes. Pale, weak from blood loss.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Sandra? What’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: It’s okay! Everything’s okay!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Jeep, get the flashlights!</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: Everybody just stay still!</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Now that we’re locked in here, what the fuck
are we supposed to do?</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Where the hell did they go?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Alright, Rambo. You got us up here. Now you
mind explaining what the fuck we’re fighting?</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: Listen!</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: You hear what I’m hearing?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Yeah…The hell is that?</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: It sounds almost like…</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Ice cream.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: You’ve got to be fuckin’ kidding me.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Alright. There’s a safety switch on the
side of your gun. Push it all the way down. Two clicks.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Now when this starts, you hold on tight,
you hear me? If you don’t, you’re going to blow your hand off.
Understand?</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: The fuck y’all lookin’ at me for?</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Oh, honey, listen. It’s the Ice Cream
Man.</p>
<p>****: Ah, he don’t look that bad.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.</p>
<p><strong>torturously down to nearly the middle of his chest!
row</strong>: AFTER ROW OF A RAZOR SHARP TEETH FORM with the sickening
sound of CRACKING OF BONES. From his new mouth, the Ice Cream Man lets
out an earth shattering HOWL. Everyone except Michael is practically
hyperventilating with fear.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Get ready!</p>
<p><strong>blam! blam! blam!</strong>: Bullets rip into the creature’s
body, knocking him flat on his back. Still. Arms and legs in a twisted,
twitching mess. Michael keeps his aim. Waits. The CALLIOPE music
continues to play.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Is that it?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Now! Shoot now!</p>
<p><strong>windshields shatter! tires blow out! engines
explode!</strong>: Vehicles swerve and COLLIDE! DARK SHAPES bolt from
the burning vehicles, scattering. In the FLASH OF BATTLE we catch
glimpses of them: BUSINESS</p>
<p><strong>people. construction workers. even an entire high
school</strong>: FOOTBALL TEAM. All deformed by some demonic force. Many
mere BALLS OF FLAME drifting through the darkness.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Spread out! Don’t let them get close to the
windows!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Shells!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Fuck!</p>
<p><strong>a hideously wounded middle-aged housewife catapults up
from</strong>: BELOW THE ROOFLINE! Her hair must have been in curlers
before most of it BURNED AWAY. Her nightdress hangs in tatters off her
body. Her jaw CLICKS RAPIDLY, as she clatters up at Bob like a GIANT
INSECT. Bob tries to pull back, but he has no traction and he starts to
slip down toward her. She’s coming fast! Percy sees his friend in
trouble.</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: Bob!</p>
<p><strong>right in front of him!</strong>: She doesn’t even have a
chance to react as Bob does something akin to a swimmer’s push right off
her body! WHAM! The creature goes flying back off the roof and the
opposing force halts Bob’s slide.</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: Grab my hand!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Gun!</p>
<p>****: Fuck off!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Pull me up!</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: Come on, motherfuckers! Come on!</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: Where is it?!</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Mom! Open your eyes!</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: I can’t! I can’t!</p>
<p>****: Howard!</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Daddy!</p>
<p><strong>teenage girl</strong>: See what you made me do, mother!?</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>claws reach through the window and grab his legs.</strong>:
Howard’s body lurches further out the window.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Howard!</p>
<p><strong>onto charlie’s arm!</strong>: Charlie screams as she’s yanked
painfully toward the window, losing her grip on Howard’s belt. Through
the broken window, she sees the face of a RAGGEDY LOOKING MAN. He smiles
at her like a father coming home to his baby girl.</p>
<p>****: There you are!</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Daddy!</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: They’re running! We got `em!</p>
<p><strong>a flash of steel. sching!</strong>: Charlie and Jeep fall
back into the diner, the claw like hands still grasping Charlie’s arm no
longer attached to their owners. Michael leaps over her, a butcher’s
knife in one hand, a machine gun in the other. He lights up everything
in his path. The window blinds become a WALL OF FIRE. Creatures SCREECH
and flee into the night, having successfully taken their first victim.
Charlie flings the severed appendages off her and she and Jeep scoot
away from the window. Hysterical, Sandra tries to push past Michael.
She’s going after Howard. He intercepts her before she can make it
out.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Let me go! He’s alive!</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: He’s alive!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: No… Not anymore.</p>
<p>****: I’m okay. I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Thanks…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I told you not to do anything brave.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: We got `em runnin’!</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Where’s Howard?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Someone needs to be on the roof.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: I’ll go.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Hold on.</p>
<p>****: You better start talking.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: The first time God lost faith in Man he
sent a flood. The second time…he sent what you see outside.</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: You sayin’ this is the Apocalypse…?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I’m saying this is an extermination.</p>
<p>****: Those things out there are vessels. The Possessed. The weakest
willed are the easiest to turn.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Possessed by what? Demons?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: No…by angels.</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: Son, I don’t know what bible you been
readin’, but in my version, the angels are the good guys.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: That’s where your book is wrong.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: How come you know so much about them?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I know because until last night, I was on
their side.</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: You mean you’re…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Not anymore…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Right and yesterday I was the fuckin’ Easter
Bunny. You know, fuck this. I don’t even believe in God.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: That’s fine, because He doesn’t believe in
you either.</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: C’mon, Bob. Have you looked outside recently?
Those aren’t exactly our regular customers out there.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: How do we know he didn’t bring them here
himself?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: He brings them here and then he saves us
from them? You’re a genius, Bob.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: So you’re here to protect us?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Not you… Her.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Me?! Why me?!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Because your child is the only hope
humanity has of surviving.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: No way!</p>
<p>****: Jesus Christ…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: You’re sayin’ she’s the mother of the
Messiah?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Wait a minute, isn’t Mary supposed to be a
vi–</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Go fuck yourself, Bob!</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: Makes you wonder about Mary.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Look, this is not possible! I’m just a
waitress! I’m nobody! I can’t give birth to the Savior of Mankind! I
don’t even own a car!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: None of that matters anymore. Either your
child lives or Mankind dies.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: So what, we’re supposed to just hold those
things off until Mary over there squeezes one out?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: That can’t be. I’m only eight months
pregnant.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Oh we’re fucked. We are so fucked!</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: How are we supposed to survive here for a
month?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: We won’t have to…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: It’s coming soon, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: If you want to live you’ll do what I say.
This first attack was a test of our strength. The next one will be a
test of our weakness.</p>
<p>****: Something much worse is on its way.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Okay, what’s your plan?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: We’ll keep watch on the roof in shifts of
two. Jeep, go get some tools. We need to close up this window before
somebody else goes out.</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: They’re out there. Sons of bitches. I can
feel `em.</p>
<p>****: Damn it’s cold!</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: You were in the Army?</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: Navy, two tours. But the second one didn’t
work out so well, so I didn’t get to go back for a third. Suppose that
makes me lucky in a way. Served with Bob, you know. That’s how I ended
up in this place.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: What was it like? Being in a war?</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: Dark. Like this.</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: So what’s with that gun?</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: Your piece. The one you killed grandma with.
Don’t reckon it’s for huntin’ buck.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: No. I uh – keep it for protection.</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: Protection from what?</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: From people.</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: People.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Yeah, people who might try to give me a hard
time, you know?</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: Just regular people or uh…</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Yeah, well, no, not regular, regular
people.</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: Irregular people then.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: I’m talkin’ people whose job it is to give
other people a hard time. Kinda person who doesn’t get enough fiber in
their diet, you know what I’m sayin?</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: So it’s a work thing, is it?</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Exactly. Strictly business.</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: This business of yours… You like it?</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Who the fuck are you to be sweatin’ me, man? I
got my reasons for doin’ what I do.</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: When I was a kid my father would sit by my
bed every night before I’d go to sleep and he’d say to me, Percy, if you
don’t wake up tomorrow, if it turns out that today was your last day on
earth, would you be proud of what you’ve done in this life? Cuz if you
ain’t, then you better start gettin’ square.</p>
<p><strong>the silver zippo</strong>: rolls between dirty fingers.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: On the house.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You hungry?</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Couldn’t eat if my life depended on it.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Well I figure just cuz the world’s coming to an
end, it doesn’t mean a man’s gotta starve. All I can say is thank
heavens they left the gas on.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Never much cared for beer. Howard’s the beer
drinker in the family.</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: What did you do…you know, before you came
here…?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I was a soldier, a general, in His
army.</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: Well, what changed? What made you leave?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I was given an order I didn’t believe in…
He lost faith. I hadn’t.</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: So what happens to you…after this is over?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Sometimes we have to face the thing we fear
the most in order to be free of it.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: It’s almost time for the next shift.</p>
<p><strong>title</strong>: “December 24th - 6:05am”</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Howard?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Sandra…</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Who’s there?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Sandra…</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Howard? Is that you?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Help me… Please…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Help me. Sandra…</p>
<p><strong>sandra’s pov:</strong>: Howard. Her husband. Ten feet away
from the door. NAILED</p>
<p><strong>to an upside-down cross.</strong>: But wait. It gets worse.
His skin is covered with horrible black boils. And even worse than that.
Howard’s boils are breathing. Sandra goes slack with horror.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Help me, please!</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Howard!</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Mom!</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Let me go! He’s alive!</p>
<p><strong>rising over him to see…</strong>: Howard nailed to the
upside-down cross below.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Howard!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Percy?</p>
<p><strong>a sheet</strong>: covering a body.</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: We should get back out there…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Just gimme another minute with him, okay?</p>
<p><strong>sandra’s face</strong>: Catatonic.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Hey…</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Hey! You guys, I think I got something
here!</p>
<p><strong>radio voice</strong>: … battling has been fierce. The numbers
of casualties are unknown but all indications are that they must be
unimaginably large.</p>
<p>****: If you’re just joining us, we’re getting some of the first bits
of good news, if you can call it that, since this apocalypse began just
twenty-four ago. A human militia has formed on the outskirts of Las
Vegas and has begun to engage the enemy. Also down in the Four Corners
area, we’ve been receiving unconfirmed reports of another resistance
force gathering in Red Rock National in the northern Mojave Desert
area.</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: Red Rock…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: That can’t be more than an hour up the
highway from here.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Does that mean we can leave?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: No. We’re not going anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What the hell are you talkin’ about? This is
our chance!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: We can’t risk being on the move when the
child comes. It’s too dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>radio voice</strong>: … And as we fight this new enemy, may
God give us the strength to survive and show mercy for those of us who
are already lost…</p>
<p><strong>a cigarette</strong>: being lit.</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: Guess it’s your turn not to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Hey…</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You mean besides the fact that I just found
out that I’m the mother of the Messiah?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Crazy thing is…I didn’t want this baby. I
even went down to the clinic, you know that? I remember sitting there in
the waiting room, absolutely sure I was doin’ the right thing…And that’s
when the feeling started. Like I was falling into the deepest, darkest
hole imaginable. I couldn’t breathe, I couldn’t speak. I kept thinking
this must be what death is like. And when finally they called my name, I
ran.</p>
<p>****: For a while after that I tried pretending that it was just cold
feet, that I could go back if I wanted to, that I could decide to end it
like I’d planned. Then I’d start to have that feeling again and I knew I
didn’t have a choice. Somehow this had already been decided. And it made
me hate this thing that’s been growing inside me.</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: You shouldn’t say things like that, Charlie.
It isn’t right. You’ll get through this. I know you will.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: How come you have so much faith in me,
Jeep? God knows I’ve never given you or anybody else a reason to. Or is
it that you just can’t find any other hard-luck case to follow
around?</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: You know, you’re not the only who’s suffered,
okay? Let me know when you stop feeling sorry for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: …Then you just flip this –</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Yeah, I got it. All the way down. Two
clicks.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Dated this guy last summer. A marine. Had a
thing for guns. Parents hated him.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: I bet they did.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: My parents hate everything I do. That’s why
we were moving.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: They thought a more “wholesome” environment
would help me “change my ways.” So fucked up. Only reason they care at
all is cuz they don’t want to be embarrassed in front of their friends
at the country club.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: The only time my old man ever paid attention
to me was when I was doing somethin’ bad. So you know what I did?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: I got really good at being bad.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: We back in business?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Is it over?</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: You better get downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: No, I can handle it.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Just in case.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Get ready.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Wait a minute.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Kyle, are they…</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: It’s a trap. They saw them coming and turned
on the lights. It’s a fucking trap!</p>
<p><strong>kyle and audrey</strong>: Hey! Get back in your car! It’s a
trap!</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: They’re not gonna make it.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Wait! You’ll hit them too!</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Kyle!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Jesus Christ, what the hell is that boy
doin’!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: We have to get `im back in here!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Don’t. You open that door and we could all
be dead.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: I got you!</p>
<p><strong>young boy</strong>: Mister…</p>
<p>****: Fooled ya.</p>
<p><strong>a flash of teeth as kyle’s throat is torn out.</strong>: Kyle
drops to his knees. Up on the roof, Audrey watches helplessly as Kyle
falls.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Kyle!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Damn it all to hell!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Oh, no. Audrey…</p>
<p><strong>young boy</strong>: I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to!</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Fuck you!</p>
<p><strong>young boy</strong>: You’re gonna die now.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Do you have no heart?! She’s just a
kid!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You can’t let her die!</p>
<p>****: I swear if you don’t do something, I will!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Wait.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Open the door.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Come with me.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Run.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Michael!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Get back!</p>
<p><strong>fire reaches them.</strong>: Everyone hits the deck as the
FIRE SHOOTS THROUGH THE SLATS covering the windows like spindly fingers
reaching for prey. Michael’s clothes are a smoky, smoldering mess. Jeep
and Bob rush to pat him down. Audrey’s coughing from the smoke.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’ll get some water!</p>
<p><strong>young boy</strong>: C’mon, don’t be scared. I just wanna play
with your baby.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Are you hurt?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Where is he?!</p>
<p><strong>jeep’s voice</strong>: He’s still in here!</p>
<p><strong>bob’s voice</strong>: Where the fuck is he?!</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: He’s bleeding!</p>
<p><strong>a wall…</strong>: Jeep raises his LIGHT UP THE WALL WHERE THE
TRAIL OF BLOOD</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What the fuck?</p>
<p><strong>lands on bob’s back.</strong>: Bob flails around trying to
pull the boy’s small, but deadly strong arms away from his neck.</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: Dad!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Get ready!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Oh, no!</p>
<p><strong>title</strong>: “December 25th - 3:33am” The sound of
CHARLIE’S SCREAM, carries us to:</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: What am I supposed to do? Just `cause I’m a
girl doesn’t mean I automatically know how to do this!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Just do as I say.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Yeah, but, how do you know how to do
this?!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What a way to bring a child into the world. She
ever tell you his name?</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: She’s never said. I just assumed it was Joe
Danvers. You know how she’s always had a thing for bad boys.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Jeep, sooner or later she’ll realize you’re the
best thing that’s ever happened to her.</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: I thought you said I should move on?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Can’t a father be wrong sometimes?</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: What was that…?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: What is that?!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: He’s coming. We have to hurry.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Who’s coming? Whaddya mean hurry? This isn’t
something you can exactly hurry, is it?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Charlie, I need you to push. I need you to
push as hard as you can.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Michael, who’s coming?!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: We’re almost there…</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: We’re not gonna make it outta here, are
we?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I’m sorry Jeep. This shouldn’t be happening to
you…</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Oh my god…we did it! Charlie, you did
it!</p>
<p>****: It’s okay. The baby’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I don’t…I…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Take him… Give her a minute.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: It’s okay…It’s okay…Shhh…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: So are we safe now? Is it over?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: No. Killing the child would have ended the
war before it had begun. Now, at least, he will have a chance to grow
up, a chance to lead the world out of darkness.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: And what happens until then…?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: You’ll need to teach him how.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What makes you think I can do that? What
makes you think I want to do that? If he’s so important, why don’t you
take him?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Each of us has a burden. This one is yours
and yours alone. Maybe someday you’ll understand what that means.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Mama? Can you hear me? We did it…The baby’s
alive.</p>
<p>****: Mama?</p>
<p><strong>high above the truck stop</strong>: In the darkness below we
see the lights of the legions of creatures dot the landscape and at the
center of it all, the truck stop. The sound of WINGS BEATING AGAINST THE
WIND.</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: Something’s happening. They’re moving
away.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: The Possessed can’t come near the child, so
He sent someone that can. Someone like me.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Gabriel. My lieutenant. He’s come to do
what I wouldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: Your orders…</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: You were the one who was supposed to kill the
baby? That was the order you didn’t obey.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What’s he talking about?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Michael, what the hell’s he talking
about?!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: There was never meant to be a Second
Coming. But we’ve just changed that. The child lives. The future is
unwritten. There’s still hope.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Audrey…?</p>
<p><strong>snatches the baby from audrey’s arms!</strong>: Sandra backs
away from them, moving toward the front door. Hers is the face of
madness.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Stay away from me! Don’t come any
closer!</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Mom!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Don’t do it, lady!</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: You heard what he said. They just want the
baby. Maybe if we just give it to them, then they’ll let us go!</p>
<p><strong>the diner. it’s right outside the door.</strong>: Charlie
squares off with Sandra, panic in her eyes.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Give him to me!</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Why?! You never wanted him in the first
place!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: No… I…</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: It’s just one baby. Just one.</p>
<p><strong>crash! the door is torn off its hinges.</strong>: A brilliant
SPECTRAL LIGHT pours into the diner. Sandra is blinded. She raises a
hand to block the light. And that’s when Michael fires. BLAM! Sandra
staggers back, blood dripping from the hole in her forehead, and…</p>
<p><strong>…the baby goes flying out of her hands!</strong>: Charlie
screams and the WORLD MOVES INTO SLOW MOTION… And everything suddenly
goes very QUIET.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Sonuvabitch!</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: No, Jeep! You must protect the child
now!</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: Me?! What about you?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: My path ends here. You are the true
protector. You always have been.</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: But I don’t know what to do!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Find the Prophets. Learn to read the
instructions.</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: Prophets? What Prophets? What
instructions?!</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: C’mon!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Wait! We can’t leave him!</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: We have no choice! We have to get to Red
Rock!</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: Dad!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Leave me, Jeep. My place is here, remember?</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: But Dad…!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Run.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I knew he’d send you, Gabriel. You were
always so eager to please Him.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Unlike you…the rebellious son. Pity about
your wings. They would have helped you now.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: To not feel their burden…is a dream.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: You think you can defy Him and not pay the
price?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: The child lives. What happens to me doesn’t
matter now.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Yours is a fool’s sacrifice. You can help
them sneak out the back door, but they won’t escape.</p>
<p>****: And neither will you, brother.</p>
<p>****: I’m not running anymore.</p>
<p>****: Join with me. You don’t need do this. There’s another way.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: There is no other way…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Come on, Jeep!</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: I’m trying!</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: Fuck!</p>
<p>****: Hang on!</p>
<p><strong>but the creature hangs on!</strong>: Jeep pulls the wheel
hard and the cruiser whips around a full 180 onto the road.</p>
<p><strong>the creature shoots off the car and hits the
asphalt.</strong>: Jeep throws it in drive just as the POSSESSED SANTA
rises from the pavement. Pedal to the metal.</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: Okay, we need to figure out our weapon
situation. Hopefully Michael didn’t take everything out of the car.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Is this what I think it is?</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: Yes. Now just put it down… Slowly.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Okay, all I got is a flare gun thing. Looks
like we got a box of flares to go with it.</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: Okay. Okay. Handgun. Shotgun. A a flare gun…
And a grenade. Alright. Load this.</p>
<p>****: Audrey, can you figure out how to load that flare gun without
killing us all?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: I can try.</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: Try real hard, okay?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: You always wanted to live like one of
them…Now you’ll know how it feels to die like one of them.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Go faster!</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: I can’t fuckin’ see!</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: Oh, no.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Jeep, your arm!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: The instructions…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Sorry… We’re closed.</p>
<p><strong>ignites.</strong>: Gabriel’s eyes go wide as the TINY FLAME
DANCES in front of the stove’s broken gas line. Gabriel spins and runs
like hell as the gas explodes.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: The swarm, it’s fading!</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: Thank you…</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: Oh, shit!</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: I can’t believe it. Is it really over…?</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: No…It’s just starting…</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: Better not hold him too long. Might get
attached.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Look, I’m sorry for what I said to you
earlier, `bout you following me around. I didn’t mean it.</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: Nothin’ to be sorry about. It’s true. I did
follow you around. At least now I know there was a good reason.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: We’re here.</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: Okay, all we gotta do is –</p>
<p><strong>crash!</strong>: The roof buckles above them. The windows
BLOW OUT.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Jeep!</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: Duck!</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: Audrey, the flare gun!</p>
<p><strong>his hair ablaze.</strong>: And that gives Jeep the chance to
swing around and FIRE. BOOM! Gabriel is blown back partially through the
rear window. He holds onto the car with an iron grip. Starts to pull
himself back in. Nothing slows this guy down. Jeep pulls the trigger
again and…CLICK. No bullets! Audrey frantically reloads the flare gun.
Brings it up to fire, but he’s too fast! WHACK! Gabriel knocks her into
the side of the car with a sweep of his hand. She’s out cold.</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: Get down on the floor!</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Get off her, you fucking asshole!</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Do it, Jeep! Do it now!</p>
<p><strong>forward through the windshield like a bullet.</strong>: The
intertwined bodies of Gabriel and Audrey hit the road with a sickening
crunch and ROLL INTO A BALL OF FIRE.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: C’mon, Jeep!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Jeep!</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: The baby?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Alive.</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: And what about…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Nothing could have survived that.</p>
<p>****: Audrey…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: She saved us, Jeep. Audrey saved us. Now
c’mon, we gotta go!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: How can this happen?</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: How can this happen in a world so
beautiful?</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: C’mon, we’re almost there.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel rockets up in front of them!</strong>: Charlie
screams! Jeep pushes her and the baby out of the way just as Gabriel
comes down hard in front of them, kicking up a cloud of dust. Gabriel’s
mechanical wings haltingly retract. The crash has done some serious
damage. Much of his skin has burned away. Chunks of his armor and flesh
are missing as well, including a large part of his head, revealing that
under his human visage is a NIGHTMARISH CREATURE. Gabriel charges at
Jeep fast. Jeep whips up his Glock, BLAM! Gabriel takes the bullet, then
slaps the gun out of Jeep’s hand. Jeep throws a wild punch, connects
with Gabriel’s chin, rocking him back. More annoyed than surprised,
Gabriel knocks Jeep savagely to the ground. Jeep struggles quickly to
his feet, comes right back at Gabriel swinging. But Gabriel simply
knocks him to the dirt again. Jeep slowly gets up once more, bleeding,
hurt. Raises his fists. This kid will simply not give up. Jeep moves in
again, swinging hard, but Gabriel blocks it, shoots out a hand and grabs
Jeep by throat, lifting him clear off the ground.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: So brave. So pointless. You should have
worried more about saving yourself.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Stop! Please! Don’t kill him!</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Go to sleep…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Stop it! I’LL GIVE YOU THE BABY!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I don’t want this responsibility!</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: Charlie, no!</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: “And as the child’s cries are extinguished,
an eternal darkness at last descended upon the world.”</p>
<p><strong>the grenade.</strong>: He spins around to face Charlie. She’s
holding the pin.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel is blown to bloody bits.</strong>: The creature is
gone at last. The sound of a BABY COOING. Charlie picks the child up out
of the brush. She helps Jeep to his feet and together they slowly make
their way to the top of the ridge.</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: We made it.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Yep, we sure did.</p>
<p><strong>the mojave desert - dawn</strong>: Vast. Barren. No signs of
life. No resistance force. No nothing.</p>
<p><strong>on jeep and charlie</strong>: Taking it in. Breathing
hard.</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: I’m sure they’re just over the next ridge.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What if we’re on our own now?</p>
<p><strong>jeep</strong>: Don’t be afraid. We’ll be okay.</p>
<p>****: Believe me.</p>
<p><strong>the mojave desert - dawn</strong>: A BLOOD RED SUN rises
behind the distant mountains. The unbearable cold will soon become an
unbearable heat. And we’re back where we started. A YOUNG WOMAN’S VOICE.
Solemn. Weary. Determined.</p>
<p><strong>charlie’s voice</strong>: Someday when my son is older, I
will tell him about the time of his birth when all the world was covered
in a great darkness…</p>
<p><strong>charlie’s voice</strong>: … And how just at the moment when
everything seemed lost…</p>
<p><strong>charlie’s voice</strong>: …a mighty warrior fell in order to
save me.</p>
<p><strong>charlie’s voice</strong>: And a boy faced his fear and rose
up to save us all.</p>
