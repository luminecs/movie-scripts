<p><strong>knight moves</strong>: by Brad Mirman</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: The pressures and demands players with your
son’s abilities put on themselves to win are incredible. The stress and
tension are difficult enough for adults to handle, yet alone a nine year
old.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: I can’t afford to keep him in here forever,
you know.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: I’d just like to keep him here over night,
then start sessions with a child psychologist.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: I knew this would happen. This is his
mother’s doing. She’s not strict enough with him. I work all day. She
lays in bed drunk and the boy does whatever he wants.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: After he’s released it’s crucial that he’s
supervised. The most important thing is that during his treatment he’s
not allowed anywhere near a chessboard.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Don’t lie to me! What did the doctor’s tell
you about playing chess! Get in the house!</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: I’ve had it! I’ve got a drunk for a wife and
a lunatic for a son. I don’t need this shit anymore!</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: You’re crazy! Both of you.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: Today concludes the second week of
competition in this round-robin candidates tournament. Each of the
players will play four games against the other and the winner will earn
the right to play for the world title next year.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: But the big story is the amazing
comeback of Peter Sanderson who is currently leading the tournament.
America’s best hope since Bobby Fischer, Sanderson stunned the chess
world three years ago when he walked out in the middle of last
candidates tournament while leading by three games and forfeited the
match to Viktor Yurilivich who is only two games behind Sanderson in
this match.</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: Mister Sanderson, here is your schedule for
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Peter, could we have a moment please?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Congratulations, dad.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: My cheering section.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You opened with the English. Lutz won’t use
it. He opened his first game with it.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: He knows you’re aware of that.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Then I’ll transpose.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: On a variation, yes – but it must be a
variation that is unique.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I suppose you have something in mind?</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: At this point you’ll move Bishop to e4.
He’ll capture your Knight e6. Rook to b5, begins his counterplay. D6
takes your Rook, your advantage is lost – but watch – Queen f5 check. He
takes your Knight – Now, Rook to d3 – he’s finished.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: It’s a good play, but risky.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: You don’t win by playing it safe, Peter.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What are you doing up?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I can’t sleep. My beds lumpy.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I see. You forgot to bring you’re
night-light, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: That has nothing to do with it.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You want to sleep in my bed tonight?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: I’ll tuck you in.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Jeremy, have someone pick up a night- light
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Debi..?</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: It’s me. I forgot something.</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: Very funny.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Sorry to ruin your trip to the city, but we
got a real nut on our hands, Frank.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Run it down.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Debi Rutlege. Female. Caucasian. Twenty four.
Worked over at the Four Oaks Hotel.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Local?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: No. She just moved here last month from
Portland.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: This isn’t a party. Everybody that doesn’t
need to be here get out!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I moved out here from the city so I could get
away from this kind of shit.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Whaddaya got, Nolan?</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: Not much. There’s no sign of a break in. I
think she let him in.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: How long has she been dead?</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: Six, eight hours tops.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Any sign of rape?</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: Not that I can see. We’ll know more once I
get the lab reports back from Seattle.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: What she die of?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You think whoever did this wanted it to look
like it was a suicide?</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: No. He would have taken more care not to the
leave rope burns on her wrists. The way I got it figured is he tied her
up, slit her wrists, then sat back and watched her bleed to death. But
that’s not the main thing. What’s wrong with this picture?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: There’s no blood. Where’s the fuckin’
blood?</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: Bingo.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Who found her?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: The landlady. Alice Greenwell. She came for
the rent check. The door was ajar.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Miss Greenwell, I’m Captain Sedman. Did Miss
Rutlege have a boyfriend?</p>
<p><strong>miss greenwell</strong>: I guess so.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What do you mean, you guess so?</p>
<p><strong>miss greenwell</strong>: I know she had company last night. A
man.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: How do you know that?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Well, her bedroom is on the other side of
mine. The walls are very thin. I could hear them.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: What were they doing? Humping?</p>
<p><strong>miss greenwell</strong>: They were having sex, yes–</p>
<p><strong>miss greenwell</strong>: – not that I was intentionally
listening – but with the walls being so thin–</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I understand. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: First of all, I’d like to say that a lot of
us haven’t got to know each other since I replaced Captain Waters last
month. A lot of you think that I’m an outsider who came over and took
away a job that should have gone to a local… but that’s the way it
worked out. So, all I can say is tough shit. You want to bitch about it,
that’s fine – but you will tow the line in my department. That means the
next time an Officer is responding to a homicide call he seals off the
crime scene and nobody – nobody but but Detective Wagner and I go in.
Also, if anyone talks about the message on the wall or the blood I’ll
personally cut their balls off with a butter knife. Get ’em going - then
meet me at the car. We’re going over to the hotel.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Campbell, you check with the FBI see if they
got anything like this on file…</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Anything?</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: Not much. I don’t think she was raped.
There’s no bruising, or any signs of trauma to the pelvic region – and
no trace of sperm which makes sense because she took a bath.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What about prints?</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: No prints.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You mean, no prints but hers?</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: No Frank. No prints.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Mister Sanderson? I’m Frank Sedman,
Bainbridge P.D. and this is Detective Wagner. We’d like to ask you a few
questions about Debi Rutlege.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I know you’re busy so I’ll get right to it.
Did you know her?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Only in passing. To say hello to.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I’ve talked to a few people who say you and
her were… friendly?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Chess tournaments can be boring sometimes.
People have a lot of free time. They like to gossip.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Could you tell me where you were last
night?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Here. I played Gregory Lutz.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I know. You won two games against him and
left the auditorium at eight forty five. Where did you go after
that?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: To my room and then I went for a walk.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: By yourself?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: This is a printout from the hotel computer
for all the messages logged to your room. Here’s one at 9:04 pm. It
says: From Debi. Please call me at home.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: She called to give me my schedule for
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What’s interesting about it is you say you
only knew her in passing. Yet, she says on her message for you to call
her at home and she doesn’t leave a number. That would imply you already
knew the number.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I got it from the tournament directory.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: There’s no Debi Rutlege listed in the
directory.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You’re looking in the general directory. The
player’s directory lists everyone connected to the tournament.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: We seem to have a little problem here?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What kind of problem?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I think you’re lying. That’s what kind of
problem.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What are you saying?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: We’re not saying anything right now. We’re
just trying to put a few pieces together.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: He’s got an answer for everything, but he
doesn’t have an alibi.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You think he’s dirty?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I don’t know, but I think you’re right. He’s
lying.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I want another chair. This one killed me
yesterday. Also, the pieces on the board move too slowly. I can see them
out of the corner of my eye. Can they be sped up?</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: David?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: No problem. It’s just a matter of adjusting
the response time.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: That should do it.</p>
<p><strong>grandmaster lutz</strong>: You’re acting like a superstitious
schoolboy, Peter. What’s next? Incense and rosary beads?</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Grandmaster Lutz, you’ll be sitting here
for your next match.</p>
<p><strong>grandmaster lutz</strong>: Oh no – no, I can’t sit there. I
must be facing North. My power comes from the North.</p>
<p><strong>yurilivich</strong>: Hello, Peter. You played an interesting
game last night. Even though sacrificing your Queen at b-5 is the game I
played against Valsney in ’82. I’m glad it helped you.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’m sure you are.</p>
<p><strong>yurilivich</strong>: No, I want you to do good. That way when
I beat you at the end I’ll look that much better.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You’re getting sloppy, Yurilivich. You’re
nervous?</p>
<p><strong>yurilivich</strong>: I’m not nervous.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Well, you should be, because this time I’m
going to win.</p>
<p><strong>yurilivich</strong>: Well, then this time you’ll have to stay
for the whole match, won’t you?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Who told you that?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Mrs. Lutz. She also told me that Mr. Lutz
goes to a medium to try and contact great Grandmasters in the spirit
world.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Has he gotten through to any?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: No, but he did contact a dead parcheesi
champion from Ohio.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: There’s a call for you Mister Sanderson.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: Hello, Peter.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: Someone who’s going to become an important
part of your life. I want to play a game with you.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I haven’t got time for this.</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: You had time for Debi.</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: Don’t worry, I wiped off all your
prints.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: What is it, dad?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: Mister Sanderson, there’s message for
you.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Get me the police.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Why didn’t you tell us you were there
earlier?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I don’t know. I was afraid there’d be hours
of questions. I can’t afford to miss a game.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: We wouldn’t want someone’s death to interfere
with your games.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What was your relationship with her?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Casual.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Casual? You were boning her weren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: It wasn’t serious. What’s your problem?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You are! I don’t like you.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Fine, don’t ask me out on a date.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Don’t worry I won’t. I’ve seen how your dates
end up.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Take it easy. Both of you.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I’m sorry, this is just too convenient.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What’s that supposed to mean?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: It means, if I were a killer and I thought the
police were closing in on me I might invent someone to try and put them
off the scent.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: That’s crazy! Why would I draw attention to
myself like that?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You like to play games, don’t you, Peter?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: He says on the photo he’ll call tomorrow at
eleven. Why not come back then and listen for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Oh, we’ll be back. You can bet on it.</p>
<p><strong>lutz</strong>: Do you mind?</p>
<p><strong>doctor fulton</strong>: You must understand that this is not
my field?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: It ain’t mine either but I can tell this guy’s
crazy. That’s your business ain’t it, doc? You deal with crazy
people.</p>
<p><strong>doctor fulton</strong>: I deal with people with problems… and
there are all different types of problems.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Doctor Fulton, we don’t have a budget out
here like Seattle. We can’t afford to hire outside Psychological help.
I’ll take whatever you can give me.</p>
<p><strong>doctor fulton</strong>: Well, he appears to be acting out
some kind of fantasy. We’re talking about a deeply disturbed person.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: No shit!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Could someone this disturbed give the
appearance of being normal?</p>
<p><strong>doctor fulton</strong>: Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: We’ve got a suspect but no hard evidence. If
you met him do you think you could tell?</p>
<p><strong>doctor fulton</strong>: Tell what?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: If he’s crazy?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: If he’s… disturbed.</p>
<p><strong>doctor fulton</strong>: It’s possible, but not likely.
There’s only one opinion I can offer with any certainty. He’s going to
kill again.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Sorry. I thought it was empty.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: It’s alright.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Is this your first time here?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: I love this hotel. I stay here every time I
visit my parents.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: How come you don’t stay with them?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Because I love them, but they drive me crazy.
You know how parents are?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No. I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Are you with the tournament?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Uh huh.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Are you one of the players?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: I’ve always wanted to learn how to play
chess. I don’t have the patience for it. When did you start playing?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: When I was very young.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: It seems like such a complicated game.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Not really. You see your goal and you go
after it. Anything that gets in the way is an obstacle and must be
destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Sounds very violent.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Chess is a reflection of life. Life is
violent. The strong win. The weak perish.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: –but you enjoy being the stronger one? You
like the control.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: If you’re asking me if I’m passionate about
what I do, the answer is yes. Without passion, nothing moves us. What’s
your passion?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: That’s a very personal question.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I see. This is going to be a very polite
conversation. What shall we discuss? The weather? Movies?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Are you disappointed that I won’t answer
you?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I had just hoped there would be more
substance to the conversation.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: I thought opening too quickly was a fatal
mistake in chess.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: It is.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Do you always open quickly?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Are we talking about me, or chess?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: You.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Each circumstance requires a different
tactic.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Well, I hope you remember that tomorrow when
you play Krikorian.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Well, I think I’ve had enough.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Getting too hot in here for you?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What are you looking for?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Nothing. I just came in for a steam.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No you didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What are you? A reporter? Just how far were
you going to go?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Well what? I told you this was a stupid idea.
You can’t learn anything from someone in a few minutes.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You didn’t pick up any vibes from the
guy?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: I’m a psychologist, Frank… not a psychic.
What’s this all about anyway?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What did Dr. Fulton tell you?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Only that you wanted someone from the
institute to talk to Sanderson for some case you’re working on. What’d
he do?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: We’re not sure.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: What do you think he did?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: We think he could be a suspect in a murder
investigation.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: The girl that was killed last night?</p>
<p><strong>doctor fulton</strong>: You might not have done it had you
known.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: You’re damn right! I’m a child psychologist
and you send me into a room with someone who could be a murderer!</p>
<p><strong>doctor fulton</strong>: Would you mind keeping your voice
down? I have guests.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Oh, well we wouldn’t want to disturb your
guests, would we?</p>
<p><strong>doctor fulton</strong>: The police came to me for help. What
could I do?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: You could have been honest with me for
starters. We work together. I have to be able to trust you.</p>
<p><strong>doctor fulton</strong>: I admit I handled it badly. Sanderson
wasn’t going to talk to me… but you’re young, attractive–</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: –the same type as the girl who got killed.
Jesus, Alan, the guy could be a psychopath.</p>
<p><strong>doctor fulton</strong>: They asked who would be best suited
for this and you–</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Don’t patronize me! You sent me into a
potentially dangerous situation and didn’t warn me!</p>
<p><strong>doctor fulton</strong>: It worked out alright, didn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Fuck off!</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: That’s what I would have said to the chef if
I caught him shaving over the soup.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: I’m busy right now.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It’s important.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: We’re all set.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I still think this is a crock of shit.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’m glad you could make it.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Mister Sanderson, this is Doctor Sheppard.
She’s a psychologist helping us out.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: We’ve already met. Haven’t we… Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: I see you’re still having problems with your
openings.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: And this Jeremy–</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: –Edmonds. I know. You lost to Karpov in ’82,
didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: Yes. However, that’s not exactly how I
prefer to be remembered. Well, I’m going to get out of your way. Peter,
I’ll see you this afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Eleven oh six.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Remember, try to keep him on as long as you
can. Don’t confront him. Let him answer the questions I gave you.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: Hello, Peter.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Just a second. Hello?</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: Very amateurish, Peter. I’m surprised you
would use such an obvious tactic. I’m not an idiot! Don’t treat me as
one! I’ll call you everyday… You get one minute, whether you put me on
hold or talk is up to you! Are you ready to play?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yes. Why did you kill Debi Rutlege?</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: To get your attention.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Did you know her?</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: No, only the path she chose to travel.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: And – what path is that?</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: We all have paths to follow. You hope yours
will lead you to me.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Why did you write remember on the wall?</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: That’s something you’ll have to figure out
for yourself. Really, Peter, you can’t expect me to answer such direct
questions.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: You don’t want to think and that’s why I’ll
win! I’m already two points ahead.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: I did another one last night. You might have
saved her, but you didn’t want to play.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: You’ll find her.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: If you got something to say to me, just come
out and say it!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Where is she you sonofabitch!</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: Ah… Detective Wagner. I’m sorry but you’ll
have to get off the line and go back to your tracing equipment. If I
wanted to play the game with a moron I would have called you.</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: I suppose you want to know where I’m going
to kill tonight, Peter?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You’re not going to tell me that.</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: “Wee Willie Winkie runs through the town.
Upstairs and downstairs in his nightgown. Crawling through the window.
At the end of Miss Emma’s street. Her God has gone and left his home. So
her and I can meet.”</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Are you out of your fuckin’ mind picking up
the phone!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Anything?</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: Nothing. We’d have a better chance if we
could tap in at the junction box.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Thanks Mister Sanderson. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You want me to go with you? Maybe I can
help.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: That’s alright. We’ll take it from here.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You should be an actor, Frank. You looked like
you were really mad. The veins popping out on your neck was a really
nice touch.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: You weren’t mad at him for picking up the
phone?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: No. I told him to. I wanted to make sure
there was someone on the other end.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: But we heard him.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It could have been a tape. A prerecorded
conversation between Sanderson and himself.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: The F.B.I. has nothing remotely similar to
this guy. I think he’s a first- timer.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Check with the State. If he’s never killed
outside of Washington the F.B.I. wouldn’t have it. Nolan?</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: He tapes their mouths shut. We found traces
of adhesive around the victims mouths. We’re doing a chemical analysis
for components, but it’s probably a standard brand you can buy in any
hardware store.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: There’s only two hardware stores on the whole
Island. We’ll check that out. What about the blood?</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: Not a drop. Maybe the guy works for the Red
Cross.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Kathy?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Well, the fact that he views this as a game
suggests that he is trying to prove some sense of superiority – and the
way he murders confirms a need to be in complete control of his
victim.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What about the way he arranged the body?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: That would indicate he’s playing out a
fantasy. Power-control killers usually fantasize about their actions
long before they commit them. Once they become a reality though, they
reach a sense of euphoria and need to repeat the act to sustain it. But,
in all the research I’ve read on Serial Killers, I’ve never heard of one
moving so fast. It’s as if the game is the catalyst for the murders –
not the other way around.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Anything else?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Yes. Why disguise your voice if no one knows
it?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I was thinking the same thing. He must be
local. It’s logical for him to assume that the police would be there,
but he recognized Andy’s voice and called him by name. What about
this?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: I would think it’s some type of clue as to
where he’s going to kill next?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Why does he call Sanderson?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: He’s one of the best Chess players in the
world. Who better to play a game with?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You still having a problem with this?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Yeah, I am. I think he’s playing us. If I was
a killer and the police were trying to make a case against me, what
better why to draw them off than to put their attention on someone
else?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Sending yourself anonymous notes in the mail
is one thing – but who called him today?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I don’t know. Maybe there’s two of them. Maybe
he hired some Wino to make the calls.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Maybe you’re reaching a bit? I think
Sanderson should be in on this. There’s a reason why the killer’s
calling him.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Captain, we found her.</p>
<p>**[lutz**: They’re trying to control my thoughts. Aluminium foil. It
repels the thought rays.]</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: They couldn’t break the riddle.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Did you think it was going to be easy? You
think he was going to lay it out at your feet?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: We need your help.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I offered my help this morning and Sedman
turned me down.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: But you’re the key. The one he wants to play
the game with.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I can’t right now. I’ve got a game.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: She could be dead after the game.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: She could be dead now.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: What if she isn’t? Where are your priorities?
You have to think between someone’s life and a chess game? The girl he
killed last night was only twenty one years old! He dumped her body
behind a warehouse like a sack of garbage!</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Gentlemen…</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: These are for you.</p>
<p><strong>wee willie winkie runs through the street,</strong>: UPSTAIRS
AND DOWNSTAIRS IN HIS NIGHTGOWN; CRAWLING THROUGH THE WINDOW, AT THE END
OF MISS EMMA’S STREET, HER GOD HAS GONE AND LEFT HIS HOME, SO HER AND I
CAN MEET.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: “Her God has gone and left his home?”</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Why these girls? How does he pick them?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I don’t think it matters. Last nights victim,
Christie Eastman was found in a warehouse on the outskirts of town. The
night before, Debi Rutlege was found in the center.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Meaning?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Meaning, it looks like his victims are chosen
at random.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: What do you mean, no?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: He says it’s a game. All games have a
strategy.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: All you gotta do is look at the map.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: His victims aren’t random. It only means that
they appear to be random. There’s a connection, we just have to find
it.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What have you come up with on the riddle?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: “Wee Willie Winkie runs though the street.”
We think he might be making a reference to himself.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Maybe, but I don’t think so. I think it’s
just a tease.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Upstairs and downstairs in his night gown –
He could be saying the house he’s picked is two stories.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: “Crawling through the window”… We think
that’s how he’s going to get in?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: That’s it?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: We think he might be making a reference to
drugs? Miss Emma is a street term used by junkies for Morphine.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Could Emma be the name of the girl he’s going
to kill?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: We’ve checked. There’s no one with the last
name of Emma on the Island.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Maybe he’s going to drug her?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: He’s killed both girls exactly the same way.
It’s almost ritualistic. Why would he change now?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Morpheus.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Not what – who. Morpheus. The Greek God of
dreams. Look at the next line. “Her God has gone and left his home.”</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: His home would be… Mount Olympus.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Call dispatch. Double the patrols. I want
that area blanketed.</p>
<p><strong>loraine</strong>: Hello?… Oh hi Mom… No I just got in… No I
haven’t forgotten. Tomorrow, ten o’clock… Yes… Yes… Okay, I’ll see you
in the morning. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You sure you don’t want to eat something?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: I don’t think I could.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: It’s going to be a long night. It could take
hours before we know something. You should try to eat.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: You sound like my mother.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: It wasn’t intentional.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Does what’s going on bother you at all? Or
are you just wearing your game face?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I think it’s interesting.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Another kind of game?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: In a way.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: This isn’t a game.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh, but it is. He’s killing a person everyday
and challenging us to catch him. That’s a game. It has rules and
objectives.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: How can you look at it so clinically?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Take your average cop. They deal with death
everyday. If they let emotions get in the way it would cloud their
judgement.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: That’s true – but the emotion is still there.
They just learn to control it.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What about you? Aren’t there times when a
young child is telling you a story so sad you just want to cry?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Do you?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Let’s change the subject.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Okay. So, tell me about yourself. Are you
married?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: How did we get to that subject?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’m just curious.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: I think it’s best if we don’t ask too many
personal questions – I want to keep things on a professional level.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You mean like in the steam room?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: That’s not fair!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Are you going to tell me you didn’t feel
something in there?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: You’re projecting your own desires and
reading more into what happened than what actually did.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Very good. Spoken like a true psychologist.
When confronted with the prospect of your own reality, hide behind
quotations. What is that Masters and Johnson?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: You have to win every point, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I just wanted to know if you’re involved with
anyone? Let me ask you something? Do your colleagues know if you’re
involved or not?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Because I work with them.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Aren’t you working with me?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You’re not?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: No – I’m not involved. And I plan on keeping
it that way.</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: This is where he forced his way in. We found
some fibers on the windowsill, probably particles of clothing that
rubbed off when he climbed through. I’ll know more once I get it under
the microscope.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: That’s great.</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: Wait, I’ve saved the best for last. Andy, hit
the lights, will you?</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: It’s a tennis shoe. Pretty old by the
individual characteristics. About a size ten or eleven. This guy is
big.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: Don’t know. Looks like a cut or a gash in the
sole of the shoe. We’ll blow it up back at the lab.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Before we go in I gotta tell you this isn’t
going to be pretty.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: I know that. I’ve seen the photo’s.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: This ain’t no photo.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Same as the others?</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: How long she been dead?</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: I’d say at least eighteen hours.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: That means she was dead before we even
finished figuring out the message.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Or before Sanderson ever showed up to help us
with the riddle. He figured it out pretty quick, didn’t he? Maybe it’s
not to hard if you wrote it.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: We got a problem?</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: Our computer went on the fritz again. David
came up to fix it.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Is it serious?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Naw, it’s all fixed. I also loaded up a
program that’ll analyze your games three hundred percent faster.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Oh, I put a few games on for your daughter. I
hope you don’t mind.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Of course not.</p>
<p>**[david**: Well, I’ve got to go over Lutz’s room now. He thinks
someone has tapped into his computer and is monitoring his practice
games.]</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Don’t you have something you want to say to
David?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Thanks, David.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Your welcome.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: You ready?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: You told me you’d take me over to Seattle
today.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’m sorry, honey, I can’t. Not today.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: But you promised.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: I’ll take you.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: Peter…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’ve got be here for the police when they
come. Then I’ve got to practise. In case you forgot I’m in the middle of
a match right now.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: You’re always in the middle of a match.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I want to be the best I can.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: Sometimes I think you’d rather be the best
chess player, than the best father. Instead of thinking about what kind
of day your daughter had, you would rather think about the Sicilian
Najdorf opening or a counter to the Tartokover Bondarevsky System. A
relationship is not a chessboard. You can’t walk away from it and come
back whenever you want and still expect all the pieces to be there.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: They found the third girl. Her name was
Loraine Olsen. I just came from the crime scene. It was horrible. How
can anybody do something like that? You got anything to drink around
here?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Relax.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: How the hell can I relax after seeing what I
just saw.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I know it was bad.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: How could you? Unless you were there.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Sorry, I didn’t mean that the way it
sounded.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I know you didn’t</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: You know, Andy thinks you’re doing this.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Doesn’t that scare you?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Because I think he’s wrong.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Come with us.</p>
<p><strong>several smaller rooms, or alcoves, connect to the main
room</strong>: THROUGH A SERIES OF JOINING DOORS. FLORESCENT LIGHTS
spaced on the ceiling cast long shadows through the room. Large water
pipes and electrical mains run across the ceiling.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: How’s it going?</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: While we’re down here all calls coming
into Mr. Sanderson’s room will be routed to extenion 611. I’ve also–</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: Do you know what I’m doing right now, Peter?
I’m looking at the name of the girl I’m going to kill tonight.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You know her?</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: Not really.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Why her?</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: Because she’s the type.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: But you said you didn’t know her.</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: I know what I said! She looks just like…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Just like who?</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: I really wish you’d stop trying to maneuver
me. I find it irritating, not to mention insulting.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’m just trying to play the game.</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: You’re not playing very well. There are
clues all around you and you keep missing them.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Listen, if you’re just going to call up to
gloat, I don’t want to hear it!</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: I’m sure there are other people who would be
interested in what I have to say.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Then call them!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Are you crazy?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Let’s see how much he wants to play.</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: Just for that no hint today.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Why are you doing this? You must have some
idea of the pain you’re causing people.</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: Pain? Pain is just a state of mind. It’s
something you learn to live with. I have.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: And you want these girls to feel your
pain?</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: Please, I don’t want to get into the
psychological aspects of my actions. It would detract from the game.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: I couldn’t say it any better than
Huxley.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Huxley’s quote also says, “his play is always
fair and just.”</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: So is mine, within the framework of my
rules.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: What in the hell do you think you’re doing?
Slamming down the phone in the middle of the trace.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You think you’re going to catch him on a
trace? Everything he does is planned out well in advance. The only way
we’re going to get him is to rattle him – make him slip up.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You never know how you’re going to catch a
suspect.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Peter’s right, Captain. He’s got to be forced
into making a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: We didn’t ask for your opinion, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Maybe you should.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You don’t tell us how to run our
investigation. You got that?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You don’t have an investigation without me.
You got that?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What were you going to say, Kathy?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Well, I think you have to play to his ego. He
thinks he’s superior. The more secure he feels, the more chances he’ll
take.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What did he mean by Huxley?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: He was referring to a quote by Thomas Henry
Huxley. “The chess board is the world, the pieces are the phenomena of
the universe, the rules of the game are what we call Nature. The player
on the other side is hidden from us. We know that his play is always
fair, just, and patient. But also, we know, to our cost, that he never
overlooks a mistake, or makes the smallest allowances for
ignorance.”</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Are you playing chess?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: When I was little I’d watch the other kids
playing baseball from my room. In the evening, when their parents would
call them in to put their bats and balls away, I’d watch them from my
window, forcing, expressions of disappointment, trying to gain another
few minutes outside so they could play – but no one could stop me from
playing. All I had to do was close my eyes and my whole world became a
chessboard. I could see the pieces, and sometimes it felt like if I
reached out I could almost touch them. I ordered them and they
obeyed.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Can you go fifteen minutes without thinking
about it?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No. But I’m open to distractions.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: I’m sure you are.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You know, you’re not the easiest person in
the world to get close to.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: You always want to talk about me. What about
you?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Wasn’t I just talking about me?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: No. You were talking about chess.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Alright. What about me?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: I dunno. Where’s Erica mother?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: She died in a car accident.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: It’s alright. It was a long time ago.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: It must’ve been very hard on Erica?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: It was.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: And you?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Do you want me to lay down, Doctor?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Look, why don’t you just come out and ask me
what you want to know?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Was it serious between Debi and me? No. Have
I known a lot of girls like her? None of your business.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Have you noticed that every time we start to
talk about something serious you start to play games.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’m not playing a game now.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Yes you are. You’re playing word games.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: I’m just trying to get to know you,
Peter.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What? By attacking me?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Nobody could attack you. You set your life up
like one of your chessboards. You’re impregnable – but at the same time
you’ve become trapped behind your own defenses. You’re cut off from
everyone around you.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What are you talking about? You don’t even
know me.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Does anyone?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Are you forfeiting?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I just don’t want to fight with you.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Then show me who you are.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: This frightens me – because I’m starting to
feel things I haven’t felt in a long time.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: You’ve got to face the things you feel.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I thought you were the woman who didn’t want
to get involved.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: I said I didn’t plan on getting involved.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What happened to facing the things we
feel?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: You can turn everything around so easily.
This is not just another game, is it?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: I’m hungry.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Call room service.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: I hate hotel food. Rondi’s Pizza is just down
the street.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: What do you want on it?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Would you settle for pepperoni?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: If I have to. I’m going to take a shower.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Did you call?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: The line was busy. I’ll try again.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: They’re not delivering. I’m going to go pick
up the pizza.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I thought you said the line was busy?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: I tried again and got through.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Then why are you backing up?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: This?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I was looking for correlations between their
names, addresses, anything that might be the same.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You’re as bad as Andy… maybe worse.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Peter, you have to admit–</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: –admit what? That I was right about you in
the steam room? That you’re willing to do anything to find out what you
want? Would you like me to leave so you can search the rest of the
room?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Peter…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: How could you think that, Kathy? How could
you even consider it?</p>
<p><strong>lutz</strong>: They’re trying to control my mind. Aluminium
foil. It repels the thought rays.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Very popular.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Since Grandmaster Sanderson leads the
tournament with nine wins, and Grandmaster Yurilivich is in second with
eight – it as become apparent that with only four games remaining, the
other players, should they win all four of their remaining games, would
still not be in a position to win the tournament. Therefore, we have
decided that the remaining games between Grandmaster Sanderson and
Yurilivich will be held separately.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: Mate in five.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: He didn’t see it.</p>
<p><strong>yurilivich</strong>: Check.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Scare you?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You know, I figure that’s pretty much how
these girl’s feel just before they get it. You think I’m right?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I wouldn’t know.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: That’s right. I guess only the killer would
know that.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: How’d you get in here?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: The door was open.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No it wasn’t.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Of course it was. Otherwise I’d be breaking
and entering. That’s a felony.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You ever do any hunting, Peter?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I used to. With my old man. He taught me how
to hunt and trap. Trapping’s a lot harder than most people think. We
used to go after Raccoons mostly. They’d get into our garbage, our
fields. When an animal can’t live peacefully with those around it, it
has to be destroyed. But they’re crafty little devils. You see the trick
is, you can put your trap down, but no Raccoon is going come near it
unless you lay down the scent. You ever smell Raccoon scent? Smells like
shit, but to a male Raccoon it smells just like pussy. He’ll walk right
up to that trap, even though it don’t look nothing like a Raccoon and
stick his Goddam head right in it. You know why? Cause he can’t help
himself. The scent drives him. So, if you want to catch a Raccoon all
you gotta do is figure out where he is – lay down the scent – and sooner
or later he’ll walk right into the trap.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What if he doesn’t bite? What if he’s an
exceptionally bright Raccoon?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Well then, you just gotta find out where he is
– and once you’re sure where he is – you shoot the fucker.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Hi dad.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: He just got lucky tonight, that’s all. You’ll
cream him next time.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You have something you want to say?</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: Just thought you might want to talk.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: Whatever’s on your mind.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Who says something’s on my mind.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: What do you see here?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Mate in five.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: Exactly… and you did this.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: Is it Kathy?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Who’s Kathy?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No, it’s not Kathy.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: It isn’t Kathy.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Who’s Kathy?</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: Peter, I know you better than you think.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Who’s Kathy??</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Jesus, Alan, you scared the crap outta
me.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: If you can think of anything else give us a
call.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: You know, I hate to say I told you so, but I
warned her. Coming home at all hours of the night. A young girl new to
the city. This neighborhood ain’t what it used to be.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Captain, you got a call!</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: It’s the same shoe alright.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Was there anyone else on the grounds?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: A few people.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Did anyone stand out?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: What do you mean, stand out?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Did anyone look suspicious? Think!</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Now that you mention it there was somebody
who looked suspicious.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: What was suspicious about him?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: He was holding a sign that said “Serial
Killer”.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Excuse me… you said earlier that Mary Albert
just moved in. How long ago was that?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Ten days ago.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Do you know how she found the apartment?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Through a rental agency.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Didn’t you tell me that Debi Rutlege had just
moved into her place also?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Uh huh… Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: No, I really appreciate it. Thanks. That’s
it! All the women moved into their homes in the last three months and
all of them found them through Homesearchers!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Who else works here beside you?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: There’s a girl that helps at the counter,
part time and that’s it.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Who else has access to these files?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: No one.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: You must be Erica.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Uh huh.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: I’m Kathy.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Is your dad here?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: He went down to the lobby for a minute. He
should be right back. Would you like come in?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: So, are you having a good time on the
Island?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Not really. It’s pretty boring.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: That’s only because you don’t know where to
go. You like hiking? Fishing? Sailing? What do you like?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Boys.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Do you like my dad?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Oh… do you mean do I like, like him?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I know he really likes you.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: How do you know that? Did he say
something?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: No… but I can tell. A woman knows these
things.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Honey, why don’t you run down to Jeremy’s
now.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Okay. Nice meeting you.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Nice meeting you.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I like her. She’s nice.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Another one? What word did he leave?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: “Is”. Did you tell him about the
institute?</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: Have you any idea what the message is?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: If it’s so important, why don’t you just tell
me?</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: I couldn’t tell you that. It would ruin the
game. Not that you’re playing it very well.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You like to brag, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: Credit should be given where it’s due. I’m
not worldly like you, Peter. I’m not an internationally known figure.
I’m just a poor guy who has never been anywhere, but I’m beating
you.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: So, why were you looking for Doctor Sheppard
today?</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You heard me. Why did you go out to the
institute looking for her?</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: What makes you think I was there?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I couldn’t tell you that. It would ruin the
game.</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: The game’s almost over, Peter, and you’re
running out of time.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: It’s you who’s running out of time. You’re
starting to make mistakes now. You’re wondering just how much I really
know. Just how close I’m getting? Well, I’m closer than you think, pal –
and I’m gonna nail your ass to the wall!</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: Very nice speech, Peter. Did you rehearse
that, or was it impromptu? There’s an old wooden bench in the garden.
Next to it is a rock. You’ll find a message for you under it. Let’s see
if you’re as clever as you think you are.</p>
<p><strong>as large as you maybe in the world of pawns and castles you
are</strong>: STILL LIGHT YEARS FROM REACHING ME. INVISIBLE AS THE AIR,
ONE HUNDRED MEN WITH THEIR DESPERATE PLEAS TO STOP, CAN’T MOVE ME</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: In a fierce magazine you’ll find a hint of my
actions to come… Why does he set this line apart?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: For emphasis?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Exactly. It’s the key.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: But what does he mean by a fierce magazine?
Violent?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: A fierce magazine… brutal… An angry magazine…
A war magazine… a mercenary magazine… fierce… Mad.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Where’s the note?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You got it on the board.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No, I need the original note.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: There’s a photostat of the original on the
wall.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: My daughter reads Mad Magazine all the time.
If you fold the back cover a certain way, the text reads
differently.</p>
<p><strong>as large as castles, you are</strong>: STILL LIGHT AS THE
AIR, ONE HUNDRED MEN CAN’T MOVE ME.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: As large as castles. You are still light as
air, one hundred men can’t move me.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It doesn’t make sense.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: It doesn’t make sense because we don’t
understand it.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: But a hundred men could move him.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: He’s not talking about himself.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Then what’s he talking about?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: If we knew that we’d know the answer to the
riddle, wouldn’t we? He’s telling us where he’s going to kill tonight
and we can’t see it.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Maybe we should back up a minute and take a
look at what we do have. All the girls that have been killed have been
killed at night. They’re all the same type. All moved into their homes
within the last three months – and all of them found their homes through
Homesearchers.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: I thought that Homesearchers was a dead
end?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It can’t be a coincidence. The woman that
owns it has a son. She says he’s been on vacation in Montana for the
last ten days. We’re trying to locate him. There’s also a cleaning
service that comes in once a week. We’re checking that out too.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: He moves around a lot. Why?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: He finds his victims through Homesearchers. He
goes where they are.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: But they rent lots of apartments. He could
probably find them all in a localized area. Why move all over the
Island?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Jesus! It can’t be that easy!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You want to tell us what the hell you’re
doing?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: He told us and we missed it! He said he’s
never been anywhere. Therefore, this Island is the world to him. As far
as he’s concerned, this is a map of the world. That’s why he quoted
Huxley. “The chessboard is the world.”</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: He’s using the map as a chessboard! The
sonofabitch is playing chess with me!!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: How can he be playing Chess with you? You’re
not making any moves against him.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Maybe I already have.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Can you get into the Federation records?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Sure. We’ve got a modem line hooked up with
the data base in New York.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Can we correlate data? Look for specific
things, like player’s ages… stuff like that?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: No problem. We’re in.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Okay. Run a search to see if there are any
players with a rating above two thousand that live on the Island.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Nope. Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Set up some pieces on the big board?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I still don’t see how he could be playing
chess against you. There’s only enough grids on the map to be half a
board.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: That’s all he needs. He’s making the moves.
It’s an opening. I just can’t remember the name. Okay, it’s a game. He’s
starting it, so he moves first. He’s white. e2-e4.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: D2-d4… b1-c3… and c1-f4. It’s the number two
variation of the Tarakoss opening. David, can you bring up the
tournament records for the last ten years.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Mister Sanderson, they’ll be hundreds of
thousands of games.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: We’re only interested in people who have
played against me.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Now what?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Have computer search for anyone that’s used
that opening against me. There can’t be more than a handful.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: There’s three. The first is 1983. Lionel
Baines. The Boston…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Never mind. He died two years ago.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: 1985. Hans Korshaud.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: He’s in his seventies and lives in
Holland.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: New York. 1986. Viktor Yurilivich.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Print out the game.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: He’s replaying the game I played against him
move by move, using these girls as the Chess pieces. All the girls have
been found in their homes except Christie Eastman, who was found in back
of a warehouse. Why?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Because to follow the game he played he had
to move to that grid?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Right. Here! c-4.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It’s a commercial area. No one lives
there.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: But he had to dump the body there to make the
move.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Now that you know what stage of the game he’s
at, can we figure out where his next move is going to be?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: His last move was c1-f4. I would move f8-g7.
His next move using the Tarakoss would be… e2-e3… that would be… Right
here!</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Each of those grids represents almost a
square mile.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: That’s a big area to cover.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Then let’s narrow it down.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Homesearchers.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: You want me to what?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I want you to feed every street in this grid
into your computer.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: It’ll take hours. You can’t make me do
this.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You’re right, I can’t make you do it. Besides,
you’re probably gonna be too busy with the Franchise Tax Board
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I gotta friend over there. He was telling me
things are kind of slow. So, I figured I’d give him a call, have him
come down here and look through your records. You know, give him
something to do.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: What’s the first street?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: As large as castles, you are still light as
the air, one hundred men can’t move me. It’s posed as a question. What
am I?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: A building?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: A building isn’t as light as air. What’s
large, but as light as air and can’t be moved?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: As large as castles.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Yes. Why not just say a building if he meant
any general type of structure?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: He’s not going to give us direct hints. He’s
going to skirt around it.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: He uses castles…plural – then says “can’t
move me.” Singular. Not can’t move us.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: A shadow. What’s as big a castle? As light as
air , but one hundred men can’t move it? The shadow of the castle. Are
there any buildings that have the name Castle in it that cast a shadow
long enough to fall across another building?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Wait a minute. There’s an apartment in that
area called the Castle Arms.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: That’s got to be it.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Okay. Homesearchers gave us the name Laura
Owens. She just moved into an apartment across the street from the
Castle Arms one week ago. We’ve moved her to her parents house in
Seattle and S.P.D. is going to keep a watch on her tonight. Officer
McLellan will spend the night at her apartment. Andy, you’re going to go
to the hotel and pick up Yurilivich at the tournament. Stay with him
until it ends, then follow him wherever he goes. If things work out
right we’ll wrap this up tonight.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You all set?</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: The board’s going to take several hours
to repair. I think we should adjourn until tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’m getting a bad feeling about this. If
Yurilivich was making a move we would have heard something from Andy by
now.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: You think we’re in the wrong place?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: This has to be the right place. It all fits.
This is the only building that has the word castle in it.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: No. There’s the Castle Courts Apartments
over on Pine Road.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: But that’s all the way across town. It’s in
another grid.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You hold things down here. I’m going to take
a run over there.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: This is Sedman. It’s going down in the back
apartment of the Castle Courts.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: How is she?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: She’s unconscious, but they think she’s going
to make it.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You alright?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’ve seen a lot of things in my time on the
job, but nothing like this. Yurilivich?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I was with him the whole time until I got the
call at the hotel.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Sanderson?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I spoke to Jeremy. He’s watching Sanderson’s
kid. Sanderson went out after the match and hasn’t come back since.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Find him! I want to talk to him.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Can I come in?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: The other night – I said some things that
maybe I shouldn’t have. I mean, you haven’t known me very long and I can
see how you thought what you did.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: I’m not looking for an apology, Peter.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I was thinking that… maybe when this is all
over we could…</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: I want someone I can get close to. I don’t
know if that’s possible with you.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You really haven’t seen my best side.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Peter…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No, listen. You have no idea of the kind of
pressure I’m under right now.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: That’s still no excuse. You treat everything
like a game.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I can’t think any more, unless it’s about
you. I’ll be in the middle of a match and instead of thinking about my
next move, I think about how you look when you smile. Remember how you
said that I hide behind my chessboard? Ever since my wife died I’ve
been… I’ve been afraid of getting too close to someone again – afraid of
losing them.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: You’re wife died. You can’t feel responsible
for that.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Then help me to understand. I want to
understand.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: It’s not that easy.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Of course it isn’t. It’s always difficult
when someone you love dies. But you can’t feel responsible because she
had a car accident.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: But I do.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Because she killed herself!!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: This letter. I’ve never opened it.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Because I know what it says.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Maybe you’re afraid of what it says.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Will you stay with me?</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Peter. There are many pains we feel
in this world – but loving someone who has shut you out of his life has
to be the most unbearable of them all. I knew when we married that you
were a man consumed with ambition, but somewhere along the way, your
chessboard became your wife, and I became your mistress.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Doctor Sheppard, what goes on in the mind
of someone like this?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: That’s a very difficult question to
answer.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Is there a usual scenario?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Well – yes… usually we find they’ve had a
traumatic childhood. He was probably abused by a dominant female figure.
That, coupled with the fact that these girls have not been raped leads
me to believe that he is either impudent or a latent homosexual.
Regardless, he’s acting out some type of revenge fantasy that fulfills
some sick sexual needs.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hi. Where’s, Erica?</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: She went into town with Mrs. Lutz. Did they
get him?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: Feel like practicing?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah. Just let me grab a shower.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Where were you last night?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Are we going to go through this again?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Answer the question.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I went out.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Don’t fuck with us! Where did you go!</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: He was with me?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What time did he get there?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: About a quarter to one.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: We’re interested in where you were from the
time you left the auditorium until you got there.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I was at the beach.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You sure you weren’t over on Pine Road?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’m positive.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You’re a lying bastard!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Fuck you! I’m tired of your goddam
accusations! If you want to arrest me go ahead! Otherwise back off.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: It’s all a big game isn’t it? A sick, fuckin’
game. I don’t know if there’s two of you involved, or what – but we’re
going to find out. Last night you gave us just enough to send us to the
wrong place. It must’ve shocked the hell out to you when Frank walked in
on Pine Road and you couldn’t finish.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’m not going to listen to this.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Yes you are.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Get off me!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Go ahead. Do it.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You want to shoot me? Go ahead. Shoot me!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You going to answer that?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Peter. Please.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: Last night was very exciting, wasn’t it?
Have you figured out what I’m doing?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You’re playing the Tarakoss opening.</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: Very good.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You’re next move should have been e2- e3.</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: I used a variation. You should have
anticipated that. Have you figured out the message?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What word did you leave last night?</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: The police haven’t told you?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: They think that you and I are doing this
together.</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: Interesting concept. I hadn’t thought of
that. If you think about how Anton Berger plays chess you might get
it.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’m beginning to think it doesn’t mean
anything. Remember eventually revenge- -</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: –you’re hopeless! You can’t even read a
sentence! Didn’t they teach you punctuation in school? The game ends
tonight!</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Remember eventually revenge is carefully…
Have you tired juxtaposing the words?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Oh, c’mon. We’re not going to spend any more
time on this crap, are we? It doesn’t mean anything. It’s Sanderson!</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: It isn’t him. Frank, you brought me in on
this in the beginning because you wanted my opinion if he was capable of
doing this.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Jesus, you’re sleeping with the guy. You’ve
lost your perspective. You can’t possibly be unbiased.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: He’s right, Kathy.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: What are you saying? That I’m seeing what I
want to see? That I’m protecting a murderer? What?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: We can’t rely on your judgement anymore.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: It means you’re off the case.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’m afraid I have no choice. I can’t run the
risk of compromising what little we do know and the future actions of
this department by sharing knowledge with someone who is emotionally
involved with the prime suspect.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: And what if he’s wrong. If you were one
hundred percent sure it was Peter you would’ve arrested him. If it is
someone else then he’s going to kill again tonight and you’re sitting
here ignoring the message.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: We’re going to work on the message.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: This stinks! You want to know what I think? I
think there have been five murders and you’ve got shit to go on. You
need to blame someone and he’s the easiest choice.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: The most logical choice.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: You don’t have a shred of evidence!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: We’ll find the evidence.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: You couldn’t find your dick in a wind
storm!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Jeremy?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Have you seen Jeremy today?</p>
<p><strong>lutz</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: If you do will you tell him I’m looking for
him?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: If we could just figure out what the next
word is going to be. He said the game’s going to end tonight so there’s
only going to be one more word.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: It could be anything.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: It’s got to be grammatically correct.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Remember eventually revenge is carefully…
carefully what?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: How did you know it was “carefully”?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Frank told me.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: No he didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You’re right. The killer told me.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: He didn’t tell you either.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yes, he did. He said, “think about how Anton
Berger plays chess”. Anton Berger wrote one of the most famous books on
chess called “Principals and Tactics”. Every beginning player reads it.
The first chapter is his three rules to good play: Carefully. Carefully.
Carefully.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: This isn’t going to be like the phone book,
is it?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Of course not.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: You’re going to be late for your match.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Are you going to come tonight?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Yeah. I’ll be there later.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Bainbridge Books.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Hi, Sara. This is Doctor Sheppard. I was
wondering if you could tell me if you have a book on chess called
“Principals and Tactics” by Anton Berger.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: I can check and call you back.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Thank you. I’m at 639-7393.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: We’ll call you back.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: It’s me. I forgot something.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: You shouldn’t have said those things about me
today. You have no idea what I am.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Peter…</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Peter, isn’t here anymore.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Did you see his face?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: No. He was wearing a mask… but I saw the cut
on his wrist. It was Peter.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I can’t arrest someone for having a cut on
their wrist. Do you have someone you can stay with tonight?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: I’ve got a room at the institute I use when I
stay late.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Okay. Why don’t you go out there. We’ll check
in with you later.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: King base one. This is King
fifteen.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: This is Sedman.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Captain, this is Harton. I’m out at
Hollow Bluffs. I think you should get out here.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It better be important.</p>
<p><strong>officer harton</strong>: It is, sir.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: “Peter, I’m sorry but I just can’t do it
anymore”.</p>
<p><strong>officer harton</strong>: I found this over by the
wheelchair.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It’s a voice modulator.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: He was never there when the calls came in. He
was covering for Sanderson the whole time.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I want you to find Judge Meyerson and have a
search warrant for Peter Sanderson by the time I get back to town.</p>
<p><strong>doctor fulton</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>doctor fulton</strong>: Kathy, what is it?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: I’ve been such an idiot!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Frank, c’mere.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Take a look under here.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Peter Sanderson. You’re under arrest.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: This is…</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You have the right to remain silent. If you
give up that right anything you say can and will be used against you in
a court of law…</p>
<p><strong>doctor fulton</strong>: Feeling better?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: I just can’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>doctor fulton</strong>: You don’t want to believe it. It’s a
normal reaction.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: How come the police never had a record of
Sanderson before. This doesn’t come out of nowhere, there has to be a
history.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Jeremy would have never killed himself.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Maybe he just got tired of covering for
you.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: This is insane! Can’t you see what’s going
on. The killer wants me out of the way. He’s setting me up.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You set yourself up tonight when you attacked
Kathy, you crazy fuck!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: She saw the cut on your wrist, Peter.</p>
<p><strong>officer harton</strong>: Bainbridge Police Department.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: This is Richard Farrington. I’ve been
retained by the Chess Federation as council for Peter Sanderson.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Bainbridge Books.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Sara, this is Doctor Sheppard. I called you
earlier about a book.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Yes, Doctor Sheppard. We called you
back but you weren’t home. We have the book.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Could you please do me a big favor? In the
first chapter the author mentions his three rules of chess. Could you
look and tell me what they are?</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Of course. Yes, here it is. Why,
they’re all the same?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: What are they, please?</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: “Carefully”. “Carefully”.
“Carefully”.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: The Chess Federation got you an attorney.
Here’s his number. You’ve got three minutes.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: This is Peter Sanderson calling for Richard
Farrington.</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: Hello, Peter.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You sonofabitch!</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: Emotional? I expected more from you.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: If you kill tonight and I’m in jail the
police will know I’m innocent.</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: By that time the game will be over.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’ve figured out the message.</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: No you haven’t. And even if you had it
doesn’t matter. Who would you tell? The police don’t believe you, and
you’ve just used your only phone call.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Alright, Peter, think. The game ends tonight.
He’ll leave one more word. Remember eventually revenge is carefully…
carefully what? Planned? Arranged? Contrived?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Ready for round two?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’ve got a feeling we’re going to go the
distance with him. Let him sweat for a little while.</p>
<p><strong>doctor fulton</strong>: Kathy, please. You’re going to wear a
hole in the carpet.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: I’m just nervous. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>doctor fulton</strong>: You’re safe. He wouldn’t come
here.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: He already did once.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Why did he?</p>
<p><strong>doctor fulton</strong>: Why did he what?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Come here.</p>
<p><strong>doctor fulton</strong>: He was watching you.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Yeah – that’s what we’ve always thought – but
what if he wasn’t? What if I had nothing to do with the reason he came
here?</p>
<p><strong>doctor fulton</strong>: You’re losing me.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: What if he came here because he’s a patient.
An out-patient?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Period! That’s what he meant about
punctuation. Remember. Remember what?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Okay. Remember is a separate sentence. They
key is in the long sentence Everything with him has been word games.</p>
<p><strong>eventually</strong>: REVENGE IS CAREFULLY PLANNED</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh my God!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: The message! I figured out–</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Sit down!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: He’s going to kill my daughter!!</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: R I C A</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Dad?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Don’t you understand what I’m telling you?
That’s why he wants me out of the way.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I understand that this is just another one of
your games.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Look, I’ll do anything you want! I’ll sign
anything you want! Just send a car out to the hotel.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Alright! I confess! I killed them!! I killed
them all! Now, will you please send a car to the hotel?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Oh no.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Alright, c’mon Peter. We’re moving you to a
cell.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I signed the confession. What about the
car?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Where the hell is Andy?</p>
<p><strong>officer harton</strong>: He took off about ten minutes
ago.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Did you send the car?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It’s over, Peter. Let’s stop the games. I’m
not sending a car.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Get up! Real slow and put your hands on the
desk.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Drop the keys to the cuffs on the ground and
kick them over to me.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Alright! Let’s move down the hall.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Boy! You scared me.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Erica! Erica!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No!!!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: Congratulations on your daring escape. You
just missed me by a few seconds. It’s check, Peter.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Let me speak to my daughter.</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: She’s in the other room. I just wanted you
to know she wasn’t dead… yet. But it’s time for her to die now.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Please… wait.</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: The game’s over. You lost.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: It’s me you want. Not her.</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: No. As usual you’re wrong. It is her I want.
Killing you would be easy. Living with the consequences of losing will
be much more of a defeat.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: That wouldn’t be very sporting. Remember
Huxley? “His play is always fair and just.”</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: You’re groping. I have been fair. It’s my
move now.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’ll give you anything you want. Anything!
Please!</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: Don’t beg, Peter. She has to die. I can’t
win unless she dies.</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: I was thinking about leaving the phone line
open so you could hear her die – but I’ve decided it’s better if you
don’t know exactly when I kill her. Good-bye Peter.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No! Wait!!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: A few seconds! Where could he have gone in a
few seconds? Think! Think, Goddamit!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Steam pipes!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I know where you are.</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: Very good. How did you know?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: The pipes.</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: Excellent. It doesn’t matter. You still
lose. She’ll still be dead before you can get down here.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Checkmate!</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: How’d you know I wouldn’t be in the same
room with her?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You told me. When you called you said she was
in the other room. Drop the knife.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Computers. That’s how you got into
Homesearchers records. You can get into anything. But why? Why?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You still haven’t figured it out, have you?
You think that I’ve put you through an ordeal. My scars run so much
deeper than yours.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What scars?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: The scars on your chest. From where I stabbed
you with my fountain pen.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: We were only children.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Erica!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: They took everything from me – because of you
– and now I’m going to take everything from you.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Thank God you’re here. I heard Erica scream
and came in to see what was going on. Mister Sanderson was going to stab
her. With this.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: This isn’t going to help, David. You’re
mother’s dead. You can’t undo it.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Yes, I do. I found your file. I know what
happened.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: They took away the game because of him. My
father left and my mother… There was so much blood… It covered
everything.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: I know, but this isn’t going to bring her
back.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Don’t you see? I had to make it right. I
ignored my mother’s crossing. I sat with them all. I held their hands. I
stroked their hair. I was with them to the end. I took away the blood. I
washed them. Their crossing was peaceful.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: I think your mother knows that now. Why don’t
you put the knife down. Put it down, David.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: She has to die!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: The game’s over, asshole!</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Frank’s going to be alright. They don’t think
any major arteries were severed.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Peter, you beat him.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: You beat him.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I got lucky.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: There’s a girl in the hospital who is going
to live because of you. You made a difference.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Peter, I’m sorry I doubted you, but–</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: It’s over now.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: I just wanted you to know in case you thought
about it in the future.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Do we have a future?</p>
