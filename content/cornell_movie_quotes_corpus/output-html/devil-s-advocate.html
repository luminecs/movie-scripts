<h1 id="devil-s-advocate">devil-s-advocate</h1>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: … we go back to our homeroom for dismissal,
unless you have a pass for sports or something.</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: And is that what you did on the day in
question?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: No. Mr. Gettys asked me to stay after
class.</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: What happened next, Barbara?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Mr. Gettys closed the door.</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: Everyone else had gone?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Yes. He told me to sit in the chair beside
his desk.</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: In your own words, Barbara, can you tell
us exactly what happened during the next few minutes?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I told him I was afraid I would miss my
bus. He promised I would get to the bus on time if I would help him to
do something…</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: … Then he put – before I could say anything
– he placed his hand inside my blouse…</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: … I was so frightened I didn’t move. I
thought if I was just quiet it would be okay…</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: … Then his other hand went up under –
inside my skirt…</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: … his hand then, it started, he started,
moving back and forth – farther and farther inside my skirt…</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: … he said he was testing to see if I had
any special feelings, that he wanted to find out what kind of feelings I
had…</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: … I didn’t know what to say, I was trying
to think of something to say but I was confused and he just kept on –
with his hand – moving it – under my dress – higher and higher…</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: … then I, I was asking him to stop but it
was like he couldn’t hear me – he just kept on –</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: – and then I screamed…</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: … then he, he got mad and said we would
have to try again sometime.</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: And did he try again?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Not with me.</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: With friends of yours?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: And when you told them what he had done
to you, they told you what he had done to them, isn’t that true?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: I have nothing further.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Your witness, Mr. Lomax.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Any chance, Your Honor, for a short
recess?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Lloyd, as your attorney, I’m advising you to
get the fuck away from me.</p>
<p><strong>gettys</strong>: Why? What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: The wife. The kid. The outrage. You
definitely had me fooled.</p>
<p><strong>gettys</strong>: You’re my lawyer! You’re here to defend
me!</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: You know what I’m thinking? Why don’t we put
you on the stand and you can jerk off for the judge.</p>
<p><strong>gettys</strong>: You know she’s lying.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Get the hell out of my way.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Well, hell, there you are. Rumor was you
were out wandering in traffic.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Not now, Larry.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: What’s the game plan, Kevin? I got a
four-thirty deadline. I need a quote. Gimme a quote.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Fuck off.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: ‘Mr. Lomax had no comment on today’s
events. Speculation, however, was widespread that the young lawyer’s
unblemished string of victories would come to an end in this
courtroom.’</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: It was a nice run, Kev. Had to close out
someday. Nobody wins ’em all.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Math hasn’t exactly been your subject this
year, has it?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Any theories on why you’ve done so poorly in
math this year?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: It’s not my fault.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Would you say Mr. Gettys is the problem?
You’re not sure. Have you had any discipline problems in math class this
year?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: No? Isn’t it true Mr. Gettys has had to talk
to you repeatedly about your behavior? Isn’t that why he asked you to
stay after class?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Have other teachers ever asked you to stay
after class?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Once or twice.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Did they want to talk about your
behavior?</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: Objection. Immaterial.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Goes to motive.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Overruled. You may answer the question.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I don’t know what the other teachers
wanted. You’d have to talk to them.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: You ever pass notes in class, Barbara? Maybe
a note that made fun of Mr. Gettys?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: No? Never called him a ‘disgusting pig
monster’?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Your Honor, I’ve pre-marked this Defense
Exhibit A…</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: Objection, Your Honor, we’ve had plenty
of time for discovery here.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: I’m gonna let this in, Mr. Lomax, I’m also
gonna suggest that if you have any other exhibits you present in a
timely fashion or not at all.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I’m sorry, Barbara, I was wrong, it’s ‘huge
hog beast’. This is your handwriting, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Yes, but –</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: You wrote this in his class.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: It’s a joke.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: ‘He’s a huge hog beast. He probably eats a
thousand pancakes for breakfast.’ You’re writing here about Mr. Gettys,
aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: It was meant to be a joke.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Have you ever had a party at your house when
your parents were away? Yes or no?</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: Objection. This is way out of…</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Credibility and bias.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Overruled. Answer the question.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: The word special came up in your testimony
earlier. You claimed that Mr. Gettys asked you whether you had special
feelings, if you felt special. Have you ever heard of a game called
‘Special Places?’ You’re under oath, Barbara. A man’s career – his
reputation – his life is on the line. This is not a joke. Have you ever
played the game Special Places?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Is this game sexual in nature? Is this game
sexual in nature?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: We only played it once.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: This special party, Barbara, this was the
first time you told the story about Mr. Gettys.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I’ve spoken to the other children who were
there that day. Can you think of anything else, Barbara, they might have
told me about that party?</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: Objection. Your Honor, if he has other
witnesses let him call them.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: If I need to call those other children, I
will.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: I’m gonna sustain that, Mr. Lomax. Rephrase
your question.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: You threatened those children, didn’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: That’s not the way it happened –</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: You told them to falsely claim that
Mr. Gettys had hurt them, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: These things did happen!</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Because if they didn’t go along you were
going to tell everyone about this special party.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: They happened to me.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: So you made up a story. A special story,
about a math teacher – a disgusting pig monster – you didn’t like.
That’s what really happened, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I didn’t want to be the only one!</p>
<p><strong>barbara’s father</strong>: You son of a bitch!</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I have no further questions, Your Honor.</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: Pack it up, baby. You need a drink.</p>
<p><strong>lawyer #1</strong>: In the event we all get drunk and forget,
I suggest we frontload the ceremonial bullshit… To the best damn trial
lawyer in Alachua County.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: So, Kev, off the record, how’s it feel to
squeeze a man like Gettys through the door of reasonable doubt?</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: No. I told you already, we’re not gonna
discuss that damn case anymore. Done. Am I right?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I’ll drink to that. No shop talk.</p>
<p><strong>heath</strong>: Mr. Lomax?</p>
<p><strong>heath</strong>: Helluva job today. I didn’t want to disturb
your party.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Milton, Chadwick, Waters. Never heard of it.
What’re you gonna do? Sue me?</p>
<p><strong>heath</strong>: Actually, we were hoping to retain your
services. We’ve been following your progress.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: From New York.</p>
<p><strong>heath</strong>: You’ve never lost a case.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I’ve had some sympathetic juries.</p>
<p><strong>heath</strong>: That’s exactly what we’re looking for. We
want you to come to New York. Help us pick a jury.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Really. I’ll tell you, man. You’re pretty
damn good. And the card is great. And the black thing – you being black
– whose idea was that? Paul’s? ’Cause that’s just brilliant. I’m just
not drunk enough yet to fall for it.</p>
<p><strong>heath</strong>: You’d have to start next week. All expenses.
First class travel and lodging. You and your wife. A lump sum payment,
regardless of verdict in the amount of, well… Here. Take a look.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: It’s two weeks at most.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lomax</strong>: You’ve never been to New York.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Every dog gets a day.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lomax</strong>: Pick a jury… I feel the hand of Mary Ann
on this adventure.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Mom.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lomax</strong>: New York is not a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Look, how you fixed for cash?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lomax</strong>: I have my bad feeling.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I put a couple hundred in here…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lomax</strong>: Sounds like more than two weeks.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Mary Ann typed out the numbers for you –
phone, the flights – it’s all in there.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lomax</strong>: Let me tell you about New York.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Babylon.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lomax</strong>: Forewarned is forearmed. ‘Fallen, fallen
is Babylon the great. It has become a dwelling place of demons.’
Revelation Eighteen. Wouldn’t hurt you to look it over.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Couldn’t forget it if I tried.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lomax</strong>: And what happened to Babylon?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: ‘Thou mighty city. In one hour hast thou
mighty judgement come.’</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lomax</strong>: ‘And the light of a single lamp shall
shine in thee no more.’</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: – wait – leave ’em off –</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: – what are you… I can’t –</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: – close your eyes – do it –</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Okay. Stop.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Okay. Open your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: ‘Go ahead…’ ‘… bite the Big Apple.’</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: ‘… Rats on the West Side, bed bugs uptown,
I can’t give it away on Seventh Avenue. This town don’t look good in
tatters…’</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I don’t know… looks to me like that dress is
in your way.</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: Why, counselor… Surely you don’t think a
small- town girl changes overnight just because a man buys her dinner in
the big city.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: No, ma’am. In fact, I hardly ever think at
all.</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: Well, that’s different, then. You’re my
kind of guy.</p>
<p><strong>meisel</strong>: Do you think as a juror you’d be able to set
aside any prior opinions you might hold about the savings and loan
industry? That was a question, sir.</p>
<p><strong>pie-face</strong>: What? Do I like bankers?</p>
<p><strong>meisel</strong>: Your Honor, may I have a minute to speak
with my colleagues.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Dump him. While you’re at it let’s get rid of
number six, eight, and I’d say lose number twelve, except the
prosecutor’s gonna fuck up and do it for us.</p>
<p><strong>meisel</strong>: Number six? You’re kidding, right? She’s my
first choice.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: She’s my first pass.</p>
<p><strong>meisel</strong>: And eight? With the dreadlocks? That’s
crazy. He’s a defendant juror if I ever saw one.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: You see his shoes?</p>
<p><strong>meisel</strong>: Look, kid, maybe down in Florida you’re the
next big thing, but this is New York. Manhattan. We’re not squeezing
oranges here.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: He polishes those shoes every night. He makes
his own clothes. He may look like a brother-with- an-attitude to you,
but I see a man who’s got a shotgun under his bed and woe betide the
creature who steps into his garden. And number six? Your favorite? She’s
damaged goods.</p>
<p><strong>meisel</strong>: She’s a Catholic schoolteacher. She believes
in human frailty.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: No. There’s something missing from her. She’s
wrong. She wants on this jury. Somebody hurt her and she wants
revenge.</p>
<p><strong>meisel</strong>: How the hell do you know that?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>meisel</strong>: Look, either you put a stop to this happy
horseshit or I walk.</p>
<p><strong>heath</strong>: Walk.</p>
<p><strong>meisel</strong>: All right. Here’s the deal. I lose with your
jury? You do the explaining.</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: Your mother called. She has her bad
feeling.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Every now and then she gets one right.</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: What’s up? You okay? Something’s up.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: They deliberated for thirty-eight
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: Oh shit…</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: Oh, Kevin… I’m sorry, honey. What the hell
did they expect? The man is guilty as can be. Wasn’t a jury anywhere
gonna let him off.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Yeah. Except one.</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: Kev….</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Not fucking guilty.</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: Omigod…</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Thirty-eight minutes. My jury.</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: You did it! Omigod, Kevin…</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Put on something that’s gonna be easy to take
off later. We are going out, girl!</p>
<p><strong>heath</strong>: Sorry to keep you waiting, but Mr. Milton got
pinned down in Indonesia a little longer than expected. Not bad, huh?
You can play it cool if you want, but the first time I walked in here,
my jaw was on the floor.</p>
<p><strong>heath</strong>: We’ve got forty partners vested at the
moment. Close to six hundred associates. This is the home office, but
we’ve got quite a few international arrangements, so Mr. Milton spends a
good deal of his time in the air. In addition to our corporate clients,
we’re currently representing about twenty-five foreign countries.
Mid-East, Balkans, Central America, West Africa. Interesting work, but
travel intensive.</p>
<p><strong>heath</strong>: He’s got you scheduled for fifteen minutes,
which is a good sign, so make the most of it…</p>
<p><strong>heath</strong>: Gotcha. Man, I just love that…</p>
<p><strong>heath</strong>: I watched a Senator piss his pants right
where you’re standing.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>heath</strong>: He’s waiting for you. Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Behind you.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Sorry. Didn’t mean to…</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: No. Please. Kevin Lomax.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: John Milton.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Nice to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Have we been treating you well?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Very well. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Your wife, she’s had a good time?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: She sure has. It’s been great. The whole
thing’s been great.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Good. That’s our secret. We kill you with
kindness. What’s your secret?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I couldn’t say.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: You were a prosecutor.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Out of law school. Five years in the
Jacksonville D.A.’s office.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Sixty-four straight convictions. What a
number.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I like to be in court. I didn’t plea out a
lot.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: What’s that like? One day you’re putting
them away and the next you’re setting them free?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Takes a little getting used to.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Pays better though, doesn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Yes it does.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: The math teacher. The Gettys case. I hear
you were brilliant.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Prosecutor dropped the ball.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Really. So you think your guy was
guilty.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I didn’t say that.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: How’s this? I began the case with a clear
conscience.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: I was sure you had a secret.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: The men’s room. Upstairs men’s room in the
Duval County courthouse. There’s a hole in the wall. Straight through to
the next room. I spent five years listening to juries deliberate.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: I love it.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Love it all you want, just don’t repeat it.
I’m not sure the Florida Bar Association would appreciate it.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: You don’t really want to go back to Florida,
do you? Walk with me.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: What do you think? Some people can’t handle
it.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: It’s peaceful.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Exactly. Fill in the resume. Tell me about
your family. What does your father do?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I never got to know my father. He passed away
before I was born. My mom raised me. Just the two of us.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: She never remarried?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: She wasn’t married the first time.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: That can’t be easy in Gainesville.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I don’t think it’s easy anywhere. Holy
shit…</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Little different when you’re looking down,
isn’t it? Tell me about her. Your mother. What’s she like?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: She’s a preacher’s daughter. She’s tough.
She’s worked in the same poultry plant for as long as I can remember. I
think she’s up to eight-fifty an hour. She’s got a church she really
likes, so she’s usually either there or they go out, they do a lot of
volunteer work.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: ‘Many are in high places, and of great
renown: but mysteries are revealed unto the meek.’</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: So they say.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Didn’t rub off on you? The book? The
church?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I’m on parole. Early release for time
served.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Lotta potential clients down there.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: You don’t have to sell me on New York.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: You like it here, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Are we negotiating?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Always.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Why do you need a criminal department?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Because our clients break the law just like
everyone else and I’m tired of sending their business across the
street.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Are you offering me a job?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: I’m thinking about it. You have the talent.
I knew that before you got here. It’s the other thing I wonder
about.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: What thing is that?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Pressure. Changes everything. Some people,
you squeeze them, they focus. Some people fold. Can you summon your
talent at will? Can you deliver on deadline? Can you sleep at night?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: When do we talk about money?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Money’s the easy part.</p>
<p><strong>heath</strong>: Mt. Sinai Hospital right up the street. Some
excellent schools.</p>
<p><strong>heath</strong>: I doubt it was at the top of his list when
Mr. Milton bought the building, but it’s a great neighborhood for
children.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: You must be Mary Ann – Welcome. I’m Jackie
Heath…</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: It’s so sweet of you to come by.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Please. We live across the hall.</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: You’re kidding?</p>
<p><strong>heath</strong>: Right here.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: So it’s just two apartments per floor?</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: You didn’t tell them about the
apartment?</p>
<p><strong>heath</strong>: I thought I’d let it speak for itself.</p>
<p><strong>heath</strong>: It’s what they call a classic eight.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: We had them paint everything white. Let you
see it naked before you pick your palette.</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: What am I picking?</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Palette. Your colors.</p>
<p><strong>heath</strong>: I need to warn you about one thing. There are
going to be some very envious people at the firm. These apartments,
there aren’t many of them, it’s really a partner’s perk. You must’ve
made quite an impression.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Took us six years to get in here.</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: Are you really this good?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I sure as hell hope so.</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: They must want you pretty bad.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Look, Mare, I’m only getting behind this if
you’re on board. You want to go home, I’m with you.</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: Sure. Let’s go back to Gainesville. You
can keep scrounging for clients and pumping out the basement and I’ll
keep repossessing cars for Akamian. Maybe, if we kill ourselves, in
about five years we can afford a baby and a weekend shack at Gulf
Shores. Are you shitting me?</p>
<p><strong>lawyer #1</strong>: Krasna. Maritime Law.</p>
<p><strong>lawyer #2</strong>: Parvathi Resh. Energy law. I run the
Islamic sub-group.</p>
<p><strong>lawyer #3</strong>: Joyce Rensaleer. Mergers and
acquisitions.</p>
<p><strong>lawyer #4</strong>: Chan Sanyou. Intellectual property.</p>
<p><strong>barzoon</strong>: Eddie Barzoon. Managing Director.</p>
<p><strong>christabella</strong>: Christabella Adrioli. Economics.
Primarily G-7 and E.C.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: There you go, Kevin. The whole team. I’m
trying to think how long it’s been since we were all together. All of
us. Too long. I’m looking around, I know some of you came from very far
away to be with us here today. It’s appreciated. This room we’re in was
built – architecturally designed – to promote healthy group dynamics. A
psychic centrifuge. Makes you want to reach out, doesn’t it? Inclusion.
Commonality. Synergy. All that good shit. That’s what I’m looking for
today. Because when I hear stories – the kind of stories I’ve been
hearing – about backbiting, about partners not working together,
departments cutting each other’s throats over clients, or worse… I feel
drained. It drains me. I feel empty. I feel as though I’ve let you all
down. We need something. A gesture. What do I need, Eddie?</p>
<p><strong>barzoon</strong>: How about a public flogging?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Wait a minute. I got it. It’s perfect. It’s
intimate. It’s quick. Doesn’t cost a thing. There’s a power to it. What
is it? Let’s hold hands. All of us. Together.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Right now. Every person at this table – take
the hand of the person on either side…</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: You want out of this, Eddie?</p>
<p><strong>barzoon</strong>: You’ve made your point, John.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: You won’t hold hands? It’s important to me,
Eddie.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: See. See, I feel better already.</p>
<p><strong>heath</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I guess it’ll do.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: Until something better comes along…</p>
<p><strong>heath</strong>: Kevin Lomax. Pam Garrety.</p>
<p><strong>heath</strong>: Pam was with the Brooklyn D.A.’s office for
fourteen years, so she knows her way around the local scene. She’ll be
your guide. You’re gonna be expediting his New York Bar application,
right?</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: In the pipeline. For now, we’ll just have you
work pro hac vice. We’ve petitioned Florida for a letter of good
conduct. And… … I prepared, at Mr. Milton’s request, an overview of the
Moyez case.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: The Moyez case?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: I gotta stick with the vehicle.</p>
<p><strong>junkie</strong>: You get ’em! Go get ’em, man!</p>
<p><strong>junkie</strong>: Tell her turn that shit down! I know what
she’s doin’! That’s right! Tell ’em take that noise back t’Africa ’fore
I –</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I’m looking for Phillipe Moyez.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I called this morning, I’m not sure who I
spoke with. I’m his lawyer. I have a card… They said he would meet me
here. Phillipe Moyez.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Bhalla! Bhalla!</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Look, I’m not sure I’m making myself clear
here.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Moyez. You need him. Speak wid him.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: You’re saying he’s down here? In the
basement? In the dark?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Where? Where you think – ? Where you think me
taking you?</p>
<p><strong>moyez</strong>: I thought I would recognize you, but I do
not.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Mr. Moyez? We’ve never met. I’m a lawyer. I’m
here about the animals.</p>
<p><strong>moyez</strong>: As you wish.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I’ll be arguing your case with the city. I
need to ask you some questions. I’ve done a little preliminary research
– precedent – cases in the past that dealt with Santeria and Vou–</p>
<p><strong>moyez</strong>: No. This is not Santeria. We are not Voodoo.
Candomble. Obeayisne. None of that. We are much older. Before. Before
all of it.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Okay. Is there a name? Or…</p>
<p><strong>moyez</strong>: We have papers. At your firm. We have the tax
exemption.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Okay. I’ll get right into that. The animals.
Let’s start with that, then.</p>
<p><strong>moyez</strong>: We have an investment in blood. Think of it
as spiritual currency.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Look, Mr. Moyez, I’m going to need your help
with this.</p>
<p><strong>moyez</strong>: Yes. That’s very clear.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Perhaps we could start at the beginning?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Mr. Moyez?</p>
<p><strong>moyez</strong>: What is the name of the man who will
prosecute us?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Merto. Assistant District Attorney Arnold
Merto.</p>
<p><strong>moyez</strong>: Bhalla. La chemise noire. Vite!</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: What are you doing, Mr. Moyez?</p>
<p><strong>moyez</strong>: You can go now. You will have all the help I
can give you.</p>
<p><strong>46 omitted 46</strong>: &amp; &amp; 47 47</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: It’s a health code case. And it’s a loser. So
what’s the point? It’s a test, right?</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: Isn’t everything?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: The smart thing to do is make a deal. Plea
him out and suppress the tape.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: I’m sure the D.A.’s waiting for your call.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Yeah, well, let him wait. And you can tell
Milton too. I didn’t come to New York to plea bargain.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: It’s only a health code case.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: That’s a veal roast, Your Honor. U.S.D.A.
approved and stamped. Eight days ago, in Kansas City, two men pushed a
calf into a steel frame as a third man fired a high- voltage staple-gun
into the animal’s skull. Men kill animals and eat their flesh. Phillipe
Moyez killed a goat. He killed a goat. And he did it at home, in a
manner consistent with his religious beliefs. Now some people may find
it bizarre.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: It’s certainly not a religious practice
performed by everyone. It’s not as common as, say, circumcision. It’s
certainly not as common as the belief that wine is transformed into
blood. It’s not even as common as the handling of poisonous snakes to
prove one’s faith. But Phillipe Moyez isn’t two thousand miles away in a
stockyard. He doesn’t use electricity to kill. And worst of all…
Phillipe Moyez is not shrink- wrapped.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Your Honor, the city timed this police action
to catch my client exercising his constitutionally- protected right to
religious freedom.</p>
<p><strong>judge sklar</strong>: This is a law protecting Kosher
butchering.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Exactly, Your Honor. And I’d like to move at
this time for an immediate directed verdict for dismissal.</p>
<p><strong>judge sklar</strong>: I happen to know a little bit about
Kashrut law, Mr. Lomax.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I’m aware of that, Your Honor, which is why I
feel confident in requesting a dismissal.</p>
<p><strong>judge sklar</strong>: Mr. Merto?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Bravo, Kevin. Bravo. Pamela, you’re looking
lovely. Satisfied, Phillipe?</p>
<p><strong>moyez</strong>: Always.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Kevin, what can I say? Outstanding.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Best street food in the world. Try that.
Tell me it isn’t great. New York. What a scene, right?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Guy like Moyez living in that subterranean
shithole all the time he’s running around with fifteen million dollars
in the bank.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: You gotta be kidding.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: What do you think? We’re giving you away?
He’s paying us in goat’s blood? I’m billing you out at four-hundred an
hour, my friend. I don’t see a whole lot of pro bono work in your
immediate future. Seriously, what I like, you got in there with him.
Inside the cage. That’s instinct. Can’t be taught. You gotta hear that
on your own. It’s gotta be in your blood. It’s molecular. I bet I’ve got
five thousand lawyers working around the planet. I couldn’t name ten –
couldn’t name three – I’d trust with Moyez.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: So what the hell are they doing?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: What are they doing? They’re corporate
lawyers, what do you think they’re doing? They’re busy reducing life and
death to the proper position of a semi- colon. They’re doing
needlepoint. Push button battles. Push button wars. Armies that get so
fucking far away from each other they need satellites to tell them who
won. No pain. No sound. No smell. One big, multinational circle jerk.
You, on the other hand, you’re on the slaughterhouse floor. You can’t
help but smell your clients.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I figure you came to court to make sure I
didn’t fuck this up.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Maybe I did. But don’t get too cocky. No
matter how good you are. Don’t let them see you coming. That’s the gaff,
my friend – make yourself small. Be the hick. The cripple. The nerd. The
leper. The shit- kicking surfer. Look at me – I’ve been underestimated
from day one. Do I look like a master of the universe? That’s your only
weakness as far as I can tell.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: The look. The Florida stud thing. ‘Scuse me,
ma’am, did I leave my boots under your bed?’</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Never worked a jury didn’t have a woman.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: You know what you’re missing? What I have?
This beautiful girl she’s just fucked me every way she knows how – we’re
done – she’s walking to the bathroom – she turns back – and there I am.
It’s me. And she smiles – it’s like a veil coming down across her face –
and that smile, that’s a question mark, because she’s looking at me,
she’s wondering, how did that happen? And see, right there, from that
moment on, she’s got a secret. I’m the hand up Mona Lisa’s skirt. I’m
the whisper in Nefertitti’s ear. I’m a surprise. They never see me
coming. That’s what you’re missing.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: So why did you come down today?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Because I knew it was gonna be good. Because
I knew I was gonna like it. That you would shine – that we would take
this walk – that we’d really talk. Why I came down? You want the truth?
I’m an aging, hipster plutocrat. I came up from nothing. From dirt. I’m
warming my hands on your talent – Where’s the chicken?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Where’s the chicken? The chicken that plays
tic-tac-toe. He used to be right here.</p>
<p><strong>chinese man</strong>: No, you passed it. Back that way.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: There’s a chicken, he’s famous, he plays
tic-tac-toe. He never loses. Hey. Like you. Right? Look, I’m rambling
because I’m excited. You’re in the part of the game I like best. The
realm of the True Believers. You are a believer, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I believe in the presumption of
innocence.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Better a hundred guilty men go free than a
single innocent be executed.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Something like that.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: No. Exactly like that. It’s faith. You’re
either in or out. You can’t believe a little bit.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I was kidding.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: You’re not here to amuse me. See, that’s why
people hate lawyers. So many of us have lost our faith. Don’t let that
happen to you. Token?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Learn the subways, Kevin. Use them. Stay in
the trenches.</p>
<p><strong>54 omitted 54</strong>: &amp; &amp; 55 55</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Mare… Mare…?</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: You’re late…</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: What’s all this?</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: All what?</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: Oh, that… It was gonna be a nursery, but
then I remembered you’d have to be home long enough to knock me up, so
now I’m thinking of building a law library.</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: Save the thought. We were due up there
fifteen minutes ago.</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: Tell me I can handle this.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: You can handle this.</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: Say something nice.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Something nice.</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: Promise me you won’t leave me alone in
there.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Promise.</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: How the hell did we get here?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Instinct.</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: There you are! Diana Barzoon, Eddie’s wife.
Come on, you two. Everyone can’t wait to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: I love the eights. The entire ‘A’ line – such
a great shell. I do. I envy you. Starting from scratch. Do you have your
fabrics yet? Tell me you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: Not yet. I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: Come with me. Instantly. I’m borrowing your
wife…</p>
<p><strong>barzoon</strong>: Be gentle, honey. These are normal
people.</p>
<p><strong>barzoon</strong>: Your first?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>barzoon</strong>: Is this your first marriage?</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: Who is that?</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: My God, girl…</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: You haven’t met him yet?</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: Who is he?</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: I swear he can hear us.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Hell, he can smell us.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Mary Ann? John Milton… I was hoping we’d
meet tonight. And here you are, already swimming with the sharks.</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: Deadbeats. I mean, that’s what it comes
down to. You can call yourself a finance trainee, or a financial
resources adviser, or whatever, you’re still spending most of your day
trying to hammer car payments out of deadbeats. No deadbeats here
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: You’d be surprised. There’s a lot more fear
in this room than you’d think.</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: What do these people have to be afraid
of?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Each other. Themselves. Why? What scares
you?</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: Not knowing who the deadbeats are.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: You’ll figure that out. There’s only one
thing worth being frightened of anyway, and that’s being alone. Truly
and finally alone.</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: Yes. I think you’re right.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: You know what terrifies me?
Responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: For what. For you. Let’s be honest, I’ve
changed your life. Changed it forever. There’s been a seismic shift in
your existence and I’m responsible. And you’ve never even met me. We’re
talking for the very first time. How insane is that?</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: It’s a wonderful opportunity for
Kevin.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Kevin. Please. I’m not worried about Kevin.
He buys a few new suits. Learns a few new tricks. He’s there. I don’t
worry about Kevin. What about you?</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: I’m not leaving a lot behind.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: You must have family.</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: Bad subject. I haven’t spoken to my folks
in a long time. My sister ran all the way to Germany.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Whoaa… I gotta think about that. I had you
down as daddy’s little girl, you know? The princess. Sugar plum
snapshots. Pastel bedspreads. Cinnamon cookies.</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: I tell Kevin the only thing worse than not
having a father was having mine.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: So you’ve got a lot at stake here. You’ve
made a real commitment.</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: I guess I have.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: It’s not gonna be like Gainesville, but then
you know that already.</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: We’re gonna be fine. It’s gonna be
great.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: If it isn’t, will you come to me? Let me
help? I’d feel a lot less responsible. Will you do that for me?</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: The worst vice is advice, right? But can I
make a suggestion? It’s about your hair, some people are sensitive,
that’s why I ask.</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: No. I mean, go ahead. You don’t like
it?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: You have shoulders nobody can see. Pull it
back.</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: You mean, you want me to pull my hair
back?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: If I do it, everyone in this room that’s
pretending not to watch us will assume we’re fucking or something. Pull
back your hair. Take a look. See. That’s it. Isn’t that incredible? You
need to cut your hair.</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: You’re kidding.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: A woman’s shoulders are the frontlines of
her mystique. And her neck, if she’s alive, has the very mystery of a
border town. It’s the no man’s land in the battle between mind and body.
You know, your natural color would really bring out your eyes…</p>
<p><strong>christabella</strong>: Do you have this view?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Sorry?</p>
<p><strong>christabella</strong>: From your terrace, is this your
view?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Sort of. Not exactly. I’m about twelve floors
down. What about you?</p>
<p><strong>christabella</strong>: No, I live downtown. This is the
family building.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Sounds like fun. Downtown, I mean. I’m just
getting to know the city.</p>
<p><strong>christabella</strong>: Is it everything you expected?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: More.</p>
<p><strong>christabella</strong>: May we always have more than we
expect. Salute.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Amen.</p>
<p><strong>christabella</strong>: Are you alone?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: You mean, tonight?</p>
<p><strong>christabella</strong>: Is your wife a jealous woman? Silly
question. We’re all jealous, aren’t we?</p>
<p><strong>christabella</strong>: Oh, dear, I’m going to scare you
away.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I doubt it.</p>
<p><strong>christabella</strong>: You like to be on top, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>christabella</strong>: Of the situation. You prefer to be on
top.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Depends on the view.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: You know what I see?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: I see the future of this law firm.
Christabella, cara, prestamelo per favore, pe lo riporto piu tardi.</p>
<p><strong>christabella</strong>: It’s a boring party, anyway. Ciao.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Look, we gotta talk. You grab Heath and
Eddie Barzoon and get up to my place right away. And let’s be quiet
about it.</p>
<p><strong>73 omitted 73</strong>: thru thru 76 76</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: Have you seen Kevin?</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: Sorry… I’m looking for my husband.</p>
<p><strong>man #1</strong>: Don’t think he’s here.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: It’s just us…</p>
<p><strong>man #2</strong>: But feel free to join in…</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Is there more to it?</p>
<p><strong>barzoon</strong>: Just this room.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: And a bedroom?</p>
<p><strong>barzoon</strong>: No bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Where does he sleep?</p>
<p><strong>heath</strong>: Who said he sleeps?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Where does he fuck?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>barzoon</strong>: What’s up, John?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: How many hours did we bill Alex Cullen last
year?</p>
<p><strong>heath</strong>: Sixteen thousand, two hundred and
forty-two.</p>
<p><strong>barzoon</strong>: What the fuck did he do now?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Alex Cullen has just been charged with
murdering his ex- wife, her stepson, and a maid.</p>
<p><strong>barzoon</strong>: When did this happen?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Just now. Tonight. I already sent Pam
downtown to make bail arrangements.</p>
<p><strong>barzoon</strong>: They’ll fucking crucify him. They’ll get in
line. I gotta call Meisel…</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: No. I want Kevin on this case.</p>
<p><strong>barzoon</strong>: I hope you’re kidding. Alexander Cullen in
a Manhattan triple murder? With Kevin? You’re dreaming.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: I’ve shaken hands with every marquee defense
attorney in town. I take Kevin and I don’t look back.</p>
<p><strong>barzoon</strong>: You’re a great judge of talent, John.
You’re the master. I just don’t see it coming together.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: I want you on board, Eddie.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Look, I appreciate the vote of confidence,
but maybe Eddie’s got a point here.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: We can get this case. The man’s our
client.</p>
<p><strong>barzoon</strong>: He’s a business client.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: We know him better than he knows himself. We
have the inside track. We have the best damn trial lawyer in the city.
It’s ours to lose.</p>
<p><strong>barzoon</strong>: Tell it to Cullen.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: No. That’s up to Kevin.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: That’s Pam calling… Are we fighting for
this, or not?</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: You left me there. I had a fucking panic
attack until Jackie told me where you were. Three hours? You don’t even
call?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Stop. Reset. I’m upstairs, I’m with Milton
and Barzoon and there is a very good possibility that I’m about to catch
a triple homicide defendant who also happens to be the largest real
estate developer in the city. I had to bail on the party!</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: You bailed on me!</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Mare… did you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: I was all by myself!</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: For three whole hours… You gotta be kidding,
right?</p>

<p><strong>cullen</strong>: … Look at this, I’m not out twenty minutes,
we’re running from the goddamn press. Look at those insects down
there…</p>
<p><strong>cullen</strong>: … You may be right, but look at it from my
point of view. I’m sure he’s a whiz kid. I believe you. But this is my
ass we’re talking. Jesus, Eddie…</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Alex, you know how this town works. You’ve
got enemies you never heard of. And now? Now you’re down? I’d prepare
for a class-A, New York pig-fuck. You’re going to have to ask yourself
who you really trust. Who do you trust, Alex?</p>
<p><strong>cullen</strong>: I don’t know… I gotta look around.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: You don’t have time to shop, Mr. Cullen. Jury
selection started this morning at every breakfast table in the city. You
lost round one. This is what people know. They know you and your wife
were living separately. They see this maid – Elucinda – a
sixty-eight-year-old grandmother supporting seven children. And then
there’s your stepson, a ten-year-old with a bullet in his brain. Those
are already powerful images in the mind of the public.</p>
<p><strong>cullen</strong>: I didn’t kill anybody.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I’m telling you how it looks. You discover
the crime. You call it in. You’ve got blood on your person and clothes,
and – – and – your prints are on the murder weapon.</p>
<p><strong>cullen</strong>: How do you know that?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: There’s a second print in blood – it’s a
partial of a hand – on the wall next to th–</p>
<p><strong>cullen</strong>: I have keys! I called the cops from the
house! I touched the goddamn wall! I was panicked! I panicked!</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: We need twelve people who can see past all
that. I’d get out in front of this fast.</p>
<p><strong>cullen</strong>: I panicked! Is that a crime? I touched the
wall!</p>
<p><strong>barzoon</strong>: He’s right, Alex. People need to hear these
things.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: You’re not happy tomorrow? The next day?
We’ll move over. But right now – this moment – you need immediate
representation.</p>
<p><strong>cullen</strong>: I’ve got a fourteen-year-old stepdaughter
who I care more about than anything in the world. They won’t let me call
her from downtown. They won’t let me talk to her after I’m out. I gotta
go deal with that first.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: We need to issue a statement.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: He’s a winner, Alex. And they’ll never see
him coming.</p>
<p><strong>cullen</strong>: I’m gonna make some very tough phone calls.
Then I’m gonna take a pill and try to get some sleep. My place. Eight
A.M. tomorrow. Alone. And you better be every fucking inch as good as
you think you are.</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: This is three thousand dollars.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Know what you need to do? Buy it. Wear it
once. And then throw it away. That’ll loosen you up.</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: I say spend it all. If you’re never gonna see
your husband, you might as well have a relationship with his money. I
swear, if he wasn’t afraid of me shooting my mouth off, Eddie would’ve
put a cellulite clause in the pre-nup.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Dr. Robert, I’m telling you, he’s the
miracle man. You’ve seen my new tits, I mean who does it better than
that?</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: It’s not my tits I’m worried about.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Real or not? They look real… They move
real…</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: Must be real.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Feel them. Go ahead. That’s the ultimate
test.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Feel real?</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: Yes. Absolutely. Real.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Dr. Robert. When you’re ready.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>95 omitted 95</strong>: thru thru 102 102</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: … first thing – I need this ASAP – I want
articles, clippings, TV interviews, I want everything you can get on
Alex Cullen.</p>
<p><strong>heath</strong>: You better get a semi truck.</p>
<p><strong>christabella</strong>: Enjoying yourself?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Sorry. I’m just…</p>
<p><strong>christabella</strong>: Just what? Looking?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Guilty.</p>
<p><strong>christabella</strong>: Congratulations on Cullen.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>christabella</strong>: What an incredible situation, even if
you lose you become a star.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: What if I win?</p>
<p><strong>christabella</strong>: If you win… If you win it’s
everything.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Any advice?</p>
<p><strong>christabella</strong>: Cullen is a pig. He’s a pig beyond
reasonable doubt. I suggest you keep him as far away from the jury as
possible.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I’ll keep it in mind.</p>
<p><strong>christabella</strong>: You can look all you want, but I don’t
fuck married men.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: What a relief. I was starting to think you
were perfect.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: Kevin…</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: Your wife is on the phone. She sounds
upset…</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: I don’t care if they can hear me! I don’t
care! I don’t like it here. And these women, my God… I mean, I’m seeing
things for crissake!</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: You just left them in the store?</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Look, calm down, all right? Listen to me…
Mare? First, you do this radical thing with your hair…</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: You hate it.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Stop. I think it’s fine. But I also think
it’s traumatic. You’ve got the pressure of fitting in with new friends,
a new place… add three bottles of wine and –</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: No! It wasn’t the wine. It wasn’t the wine
or my hair or talking to Kathy, because I know that’s what you’re gonna
say –</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: What about Kathy?</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: What about her? She’s pregnant again.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Oh, and that’s got nothing to do with it…</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: Kevin, I never see you anymore. Now that
you’ve got this big case, it’s just only gonna get worse. I don’t know
anybody here. These women scare the living shit out of me. If you can
believe it, I’m actually looking forward to having your mother come and
visit.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: What about the apartment?</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: Exactly! You just go out – you buy a few
new suits and you’re fine. I’ve got this whole place to fill up and I
know we have all this money and it’s supposed to be fun, but it isn’t!
It’s like a test! The whole thing is like one big test! I’m lonely.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Let’s make a baby.</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: Don’t tease me.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I wouldn’t do that. Unless you asked.</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: You hate my hair, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: Stop.</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Right here.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: … because it needs to be clear, Mr. Cullen,
because I need to understand exactly what happened – you’re standing
there – you look down – there’s the gun –</p>
<p><strong>cullen</strong>: I don’t know why I picked it up – it was
before I saw Elucinda’s body and then, I mean we’ve been over this…</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: You kneeled down to pick it up?</p>
<p><strong>cullen</strong>: You work late. You come home. You walk in.
Everybody’s dead. It’s not something you plan for.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Back up. Two prints by the gun. Right knee.
Right hand. It’s a strange move you must’ve made to pick it up.</p>
<p><strong>cullen</strong>: The blood, I don’t know, maybe I was trying
to avoid the blood.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I’m trying to picture it… Your hand came from
inside and underneath.</p>
<p><strong>cullen</strong>: You want to see? Here… I’ll fucking show
you.</p>
<p><strong>cullen</strong>: Okay? Clear? Got it?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Whose gun is that, Alex?</p>
<p><strong>cullen</strong>: It’s mine.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Are you out of your mind? You’re charged in a
triple homicide, you’re walking around with a forty-five?</p>
<p><strong>cullen</strong>: I’ve had nine death threats.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Give it over. Now. Gimme the gun.</p>
<p><strong>cullen</strong>: I gotta protect myself.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: That’s my job. When the case is over you can
have it back. This is a dealbreaker, Alex.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Okay. Let’s wrap it up.</p>
<p><strong>cullen</strong>: So what’s next?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: We need to talk to your assistant.</p>
<p><strong>cullen</strong>: Call her.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: You feel confident she’ll back you on the
time.</p>
<p><strong>cullen</strong>: Melissa, yeah. She’s okay. She’s a real
straight arrow.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: So we’re going to talk to her and you’re not
going to talk to anybody. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>cullen</strong>: No comment.</p>
<p><strong>melissa</strong>: Would my babysitter have to testify?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: We need her to establish the time you
returned home.</p>
<p><strong>melissa</strong>: She doesn’t have her green card is why I
ask. I don’t want her to get in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Tell you what, Melissa, let’s talk to her
first. See where she stands and take it from there.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: I’ll make sure Melissa gets down to the
car.</p>
<p><strong>melissa</strong>: Mr. Cullen didn’t kill those people.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: That’s why we’re all working so hard.</p>
<p><strong>barzoon</strong>: Okay, Excelsior Insurance, who’s handling
that? All this has to go. Guatemala, Sudan, Cyprus… Let’s stay organized
here. Martin, no. Devada Holdings. That’s all you’re doing. Believe me,
it’ll take all night.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I thought I was the only one working
late.</p>
<p><strong>barzoon</strong>: So did we.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Good news. We just wrapped up with Cullen’s
assistant. She looks like a great alibi.</p>
<p><strong>barzoon</strong>: What a pleasant surprise.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: But it looks like you have your hands
full.</p>
<p><strong>barzoon</strong>: Just a little housekeeping. If they ask,
you never saw this.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Who would ask?</p>
<p><strong>barzoon</strong>: Weaver.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Who’s that?</p>
<p><strong>barzoon</strong>: Justice Department. Weaver Commission. You
don’t know about Weaver?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>barzoon</strong>: How nice for you.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Grab your coat, Mr. Lomax…</p>

<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I’d have to call Mary Ann…</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Do it on the way.</p>
<p><strong>barzoon</strong>: You get my message?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: You write beautifully, Eddie.</p>
<p><strong>barzoon</strong>: We need to talk.</p>

<p><strong>milton</strong>: I don’t micro-manage. You find the talent
and then you delegate. Who knows what the hell Eddie’s up to. He’s got a
lotta fingers in a lotta pies.</p>
<p><strong>big guy</strong>: What the fuck you looking at? You fucking
deaf or something?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: No. I can hear you just fine.</p>
<p><strong>big guy</strong>: Good, ’cause I want you should get your
skinny little ass somewhere down the fucking car away from me.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: I’m not going anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Oh, shit. John…</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Maricela, the moment you left the apartment
she was upstairs with Carlos. They’re on the pipe right now, my friend.
They’re in the kitchen splitting a jumbo and then he’s going to fuck her
in the ass, right on your bed, and she’s going to like it.</p>
<p><strong>big guy</strong>: Como…? How do you…?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Do yourself a favor and put that knife where
it belongs.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: What did you say to him?</p>

were going to kick all three of their asses.</p>

cigarette. You want me to lie? One cigarette after seven months is not –
That’s exactly what I’m saying. Go to bed. I have no idea. I told you,
he never sleeps. Mare. Stop. The guy pays our bills. The food, the heat,
the rent on that enormous fucking apartment we live in. I live there,

stepdaughter. This is it. You better have a great reason to call me
out.</p>

with a friend. She says and I quote: ‘Alex is fucking around and I can
prove it.’</p>
<p><strong>cullen</strong>: Hearsay. Never gets in.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Wrong answer. Your prenuptial agreement is on
file at the firm. The contract is null and void in the event of marital
infidelity. You fuck around, she gets rich. That’s a motive, Alex. What
do I need to know?</p>
<p><strong>cullen</strong>: Melissa. My assistant. She’s not even that
good a fuck.</p>

fight like that.</p>

exactly your area of expertise.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lomax</strong>: Are you happy here?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lomax</strong>: Are you happy here?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: You’re kidding, right? Am I happy? Every now
and then I look around and I think my mama must be praying awful hard
for me, ’cause I died and went to heaven. Am I happy?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lomax</strong>: You were always running somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I guess I finally got there. Look, I’m sorry
about being so busy this week. Maybe Saturday I can get some time off
and…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lomax</strong>: Don’t worry on it. I love you more than
anything in the whole world. You know that, don’t you?</p>

got my teeth kicked in on the front page, so I gotta run. We’ll talk
later.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lomax</strong>: I have to go, Kevin. I miss my
church.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Ma, this is New York, there must be
twenty-thousand goddamn churches. Take your pick.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lomax</strong>: You need to do a better job with Mary
Ann. She’s not well. This place isn’t good for her.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: So stay. Take care of her if you’re so
concerned! Help me out.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lomax</strong>: I’ll take her home if you let me.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: This is home. You understand? This is where
we live! I’m not going back to Gainesville. Unbelievable.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lomax</strong>: ‘Wide is the gate, and broad is the way
that leadeth to temptation.’</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: It’s a little early for scripture. I’m going
to work. You can do whatever you want.</p>
<p><strong>melissa</strong>: I can’t do it. It’s one thing to have an
affair with your boss, it’s another to have to tell the world in a
murder case.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: We have to bring it out, Melissa.</p>
<p><strong>melissa</strong>: My ex-husband would have a field day with
this.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: A man’s life is at stake. You’re our whole
case.</p>
<p><strong>weaver</strong>: … there is nothing vague or exploratory
about this subpoena request, Your Honor. We’re specifically asking for
any and all documents relating to Devada Holdings. It’s taken six months
and seventeen separate motions and we still don’t know who’s responsible
here. We’ve got a paper trail here that seems to stretch into
eternity!</p>

Honor. We’ve been conducting a comprehensive search of our records and
I’m sorry to say it’s a great deal less than Mr. Weaver would
suggest.</p>
<p><strong>weaver</strong>: Your Honor, this is outrageous. We need to
get in there and seize these documents before there’s nothing left!</p>

Okay?</p>

the fuck is it today, Mare? I swear to God, I’m calling this doctor, I’m
gonna find out what the hell they’re giving you.</p>

sisters have seven children between them. My mother had Derek when she
was forty-five. You could set a clock by my periods.</p>

call you right back. Thanks. He thinks, he’s not sure, he thinks it

<p><strong>milton</strong>: I want you to drop this case.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: This case? Cullen? John, I’ve got a jury
showing up this morning.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Do you love this woman?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Yes. Of course I do.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Kevin, she’s sick. Everyone will understand.
I’ll understand.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: What about Cullen?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: We’ll find someone new. You consult. You
live to fight another day.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I put together a great jury.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: It’s a disappointment. We all have them.
Embrace it. Use it. You move on.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Hang on, we gotta talk about this.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: What’s to talk? It’s your wife, man. And
she’s very sick. And that’s gotta come first. Are you telling me the
possibility of leaving the case has never crossed your mind?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: You know what scares me? I quit the case. She
gets better. And I hate her for it. I don’t want to resent her, John.
I’ve got a winner here. I gotta nail this fucker down, do it fast, and
put it behind me. Just get it done. Then put all my energy into her.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: I guess you have thought about it. I stand
corrected.</p>
<p><strong>broygo</strong>: … And when all that evidence is laid before
you, when all these pieces weave together, you will conclude – you will
know – that Alexander Cullen is guilty of murdering three people in cold
blood with malice aforethought.</p>
<p><strong>judge poe</strong>: Mr. Lomax… We can break for lunch now, or
you can do a stop and start…</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: If it’s a choice, I’ll go now. I won’t be as
long as Mr. Broygo.</p>
<p><strong>judge poe</strong>: Proceed.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: We just spent our morning listening to
Mr. Broygo talk about his ‘evidence’. What he neglected to tell you is
what this case is really about. He left out the most important fact of
all: Alex Cullen was somewhere else when these murders took place. Now,
Alex Cullen has done a lot of things I don’t like. He’s been a terrible
husband to all three of his wives. He’s been a destructive force in the
lives of his step-children. He’s cheated the city. His partners. His
employees. He’s paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in penalties and
fines over the years. I don’t like those things. I don’t expect you to
like them. There will be other things during the course of this trial
that you will hear about and like even less. But this isn’t a popularity
contest. It’s a murder trial and Alex Cullen hasn’t killed anybody.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: The state is going all out here. They’ve got
a whole team over there. They’re throwing everything but the kitchen
sink at this case. I need one thing from you. That’s it. One thing. I
need you to ask yourself, ‘Is not liking this man reason enough to
convict him of murder?’ Enjoy your lunch. We’ll talk again.</p>
<p><strong>cullen</strong>: What the fuck was that? Are you out of your
fucking mind? They fucking hate me!</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Listen to me like you’ve never listened to
anybody before. I’m going to bust my ass to make sure they hate you.
Because as long as you’re out boning Melissa, you’re not home killing
your wife.</p>
<p><strong>cullen</strong>: Why didn’t you tell me before?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Then it doesn’t look spontaneous.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Let me put it this way, then: can you tell
from a blood sample if the person were alive or dead?</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: The victim? Of course not.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: And there’s a two hour window in which to
place these murders.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: So, you’ve got absolutely no way to determine
the condition of the victims when Alexander Cullen put his hand on that
wall.</p>
<p><strong>174 omitted 174</strong>: &amp; &amp; 175 175</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Eddie…</p>
<p><strong>barzoon</strong>: Saw you go in.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>barzoon</strong>: Congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: It’s not over yet.</p>
<p><strong>barzoon</strong>: I’m not talking about the trial.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>barzoon</strong>: How the fuck does your name get on the
firm’s charter?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>barzoon</strong>: Looks like it’s been there for years. Now
you’re a partner? When did that happen? I am still the managing director
of this firm. You want my job? Take me head on. Backdoor me one more
time and I’ll take your partnership papers and stuff ’em down your
throat.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I don’t know what you’re talking about, but I
sure as hell don’t like your tone of voice.</p>
<p><strong>barzoon</strong>: Bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: You got a problem with documents, I suggest
you put together one of your late-night shredding sessions.</p>
<p><strong>barzoon</strong>: You think you’re tough enough to run this
firm? Fine. You tell Milton next time Weaver calls maybe I pick up the
phone.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Was he drunk?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I doubt it. He was going running. What the
hell was he talking about?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Eddie’s gotten himself into trouble again.
And he wants me to save him. And I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Why does he think I’m after his job?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Do you have any experience with
manic-depression?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Not directly, no.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: You do now.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Yes, it’s me. Get Eddie Barzoon. Right away.
He may be out running, so page him if you have to. It’s an emergency.
Looks like you could use a drink.</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: Eddie Barzoon. I’ve nursed him through two
divorces, a cocaine rehab, and a pregnant receptionist. God’s creature,
right?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: I’ll tell you, Kevin, because I know you’re
into theology. When you’ve seen – when you’ve represented – when you’ve
dealt with as many people as I have over the years, finally you say to
yourself, ‘God must’ve been awfully bored.’</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Choice. The opportunity to fuck up. Talk
about entertainment value.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: You take a look at Eddie Barzoon you gotta
wonder if maybe God overplayed his hand. Maybe he made the game a little
too interesting…</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Gimme your watch.</p>
<p><strong>barzoon</strong>: You want the watch, old man? Come and get
it.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: You take a look at Eddie Barzoon you gotta
wonder if maybe God overplayed his hand. Maybe he made the game a little
too interesting.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I’m gonna, I’m gonna go downstairs now. Put
this stuff away. Ice cream’s already melting.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: You testified that the defendant called you
at four-thirty to ask you to come to his office gym for the purposes of
sex.</p>
<p><strong>melissa</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Mr. Cullen, though, he’s not just your lover,
is he? He’s the boss.</p>
<p><strong>melissa</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: So two hours go by before you act on his
request?</p>
<p><strong>melissa</strong>: Yes, I went up at six-ten. I knew it was
six-ten, they had weather coming on the news. I remember –</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Okay. Stop. This prosecutor is no fool. He’s
gonna change tempo, attitude, tone of voice – he’s gonna come out with
questions you never thought of, just to screw you up. So what do we
do?</p>
<p><strong>melissa</strong>: Yes and no answers. Stay calm.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Exactly. Is it your testimony, Ms. Block,
that between the hours of six-ten and nine-forty you were engaged in
sexual congress with the defendant?</p>
<p><strong>melissa</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: At any point during this three hour marathon,
Ms. Block, did you lose sight of the defendant?</p>
<p><strong>melissa</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Did he use the bathroom?</p>
<p><strong>melissa</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Is he circumcised? You understand the
question?</p>
<p><strong>melissa</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: So is he cut or not?</p>
<p><strong>melissa</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Which is it?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: You’ve been polishing his knob three times a
week for six months and you don’t know whether or not he’s got
foreskin?</p>
<p><strong>melissa</strong>: I’ve had it up to here with this fucking
game. Why don’t you take your questions and shove ’em up your ass.</p>
<p><strong>christabella</strong>: Oh, Kevin –</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: What’s happened?</p>
<p><strong>christabella</strong>: Eddie Barzoon…</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: What about him?</p>
<p><strong>christabella</strong>: He’s dead. He was killed.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>heath</strong>: Last night in the park. He was running if you
can believe it.</p>
<p><strong>christabella</strong>: What is wrong with people?</p>
<p><strong>heath</strong>: At least they got the scumbags who did
it.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>lawyer #1</strong>: Two old, homeless crazies.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: Kevin… Kevin, I’m sorry, but you’re due in
court in thirty minutes.</p>
<p><strong>melissa</strong>: Are we through here, or what?</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: I’ll bring Melissa down in the car, but you
better get going.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: I want you to put Eddie aside. Let me worry
about it. You gotta deal with Cullen now. Marshal your strength.
Prioritize. Conserve your energy.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I can’t put her on the stand.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: What choice do we have?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I know she’s lying.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Because she didn’t answer you fast enough?
Did she lie to you? No. She said nothing. The fact is, you’ll never
know.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: He killed those people.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: You really believe that?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Cullen set me up. Melissa, the whole thing, I
know it.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Look, you gotta go with your gut.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: That’s your advice?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: I’ll back you either way. Hey, you think I
haven’t lost before? We talked about this, Kevin. Pressure. Take a big
whiff.</p>
<p><strong>judge poe</strong>: Mr. Lomax, you may call your next
witness.</p>
<p><strong>judge poe</strong>: Counselor…</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I call Melissa Block.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: Kevin! Kevin, it’s for you –</p>
<p><strong>feeney</strong>: She didn’t look well, sir. Felix tried to
talk to her, but she –</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Honey… Mare. It’s me.</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: He let himself in. You need to know that.
The bath running, or something, I didn’t hear him. I swear to you.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: Then we talked. We talked for hours. I
haven’t talked to anyone, really talked to anyone in such a long time.
You have this whole life and all I have is me and he was so clear about
it all.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Who let himself in?</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: I came down here. I’ve just been sitting.
I’m afraid to pray. I let him stay. I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m sorry,
Kevin.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Did somebody hurt you?</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: Milton. He fucked me, Kevin. I let him
fuck me. I couldn’t stop him.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: What? When?</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: Today. This afternoon. All afternoon. God,
I’m so ashamed…</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Today? Today? Today. He was in court, Mare.
He was in court, in my presence all afternoon!</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: I’m not crazy. I’m not. I swear.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I don’t know, Mare. I don’t know how much
more of this I can take.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Sign there… And there… And one more… She’s
calm now so this might be a good time to say good night.</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: I know why this is happening.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: They want you to go to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: It’s the money, Kevin. Blood money. We
just drank it down. Both of us. We knew it. Winning those cases, taking
the money. We knew they were guilty. But you kept winning. Every
time.</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: I can’t look at myself in the mirror,
Kevin.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: What do they say?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: They don’t know. It’s bad. She’s falling
apart.</p>
<p><strong>christabella</strong>: Do you have room for one more?</p>
<p><strong>the priest</strong>: We are here today, to remember and pray
and exalt in the spirit of Edward Barzoon…</p>
<p><strong>the priest</strong>: … Father, husband, partner, friend,
colleague…</p>
<p><strong>the priest</strong>: … taken from us so suddenly…</p>
<p><strong>the priest</strong>: … to contemplate evil. How it robs – how
it steals everything of value from us…</p>
<p><strong>the priest</strong>: … farther from God’s purpose…</p>
<p><strong>the priest</strong>: … and the greater that distance, the
greater evil’s pleasure…</p>
<p><strong>weaver</strong>: Mr. Lomax?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: No comment. I’ll have something for you
later.</p>
<p><strong>weaver</strong>: I’m a friend of Eddie Barzoon.</p>
<p><strong>weaver</strong>: Remember me? Mitch Weaver. Justice
Department.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Staking out the funeral?</p>
<p><strong>weaver</strong>: Looking for you actually.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I’m in a bit of a hurry right now. I need to
talk to my wife.</p>
<p><strong>weaver</strong>: Just wanted to ask you – off the record – I
had a few questions about Eddie.</p>
<p><strong>weaver</strong>: Milton, Chadwick, Waters is a little more
than a law firm, but then I assume you knew that. Devada Holdings? I’m
sure you’ve heard of it. London, Kinshasa, Karachi – Arms brokering
mostly. You’ve got Munzer-Dietch, they’re in Berlin and Djakarta –
chemical weapons, toxic waste. Ivanaco Limited – Moscow – money
laundering for the Eastern Bloc. It goes on and on, Kevin.</p>
<p><strong>weaver</strong>: Milton is into everything. Barzoon was
coming in, Kevin. He was gonna testify.</p>
<p><strong>weaver</strong>: Desoto and Dibalista, in Panama, that’s a
firm that specializes in opening bank accounts for judges all over South
America. Huge drug cases. Murder. Everything.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: He’s a lawyer! What the fuck do you want?
Stay off my back.</p>
<p><strong>weaver</strong>: This is a first time, last time offer! I’m
learning about you, Kevin. I talked to some old friends down in Florida
this morning… The Gettys case. The eighth grade teacher? Found him this
morning. He had the body of a ten-year-old girl in the trunk of his
car.</p>
<p><strong>224 omitted 224</strong>: &amp; &amp; 225 225</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lomax</strong>: Kevin… honey…</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lomax</strong>: I came this morning. I been calling the
house and getting no answer and then I spoke to Pam and… I need to talk
to you.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: We got her on the first flight up this
morning.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lomax</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I just… I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lomax</strong>: Will you excuse us a moment?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lomax</strong>: I never should’ve left. I knew it. I’ll
never forgive myself.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I was gonna call you, I just…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lomax</strong>: What I did, Kevin, I thought it was for
the best. Loving you was always first for me.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: There’s nothing you could’ve done.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lomax</strong>: I could’ve told you the truth.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lomax</strong>: I’ve lied to you, Kevin.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lomax</strong>: Always. Baptist Endeavor Youth Crusade,
ninety-sixty-four. I was here. In New York. That night in the elevator,
you never let me answer.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lomax</strong>: We stayed a week. The Tremont Hotel,
it’s not there anymore, I went by and it’s gone – they had a restaurant
downstairs and we ate there almost every meal –</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Wait. Stop.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lomax</strong>: Your father was a waiter in that
restaurant.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Oh, this is great, Ma… this is just perfect
–</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lomax</strong>: – honey, listen to me –</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: – Now? You do this now? – Because, I mean,
your timing – it’s superb – you wait thirty years? – you fly up here –
you pick today? –</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lomax</strong>: – Kevin, honey, wait –</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: – obviously I’m not under enough pressure – I
don’t have enough on my mind, I need this little –</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lomax</strong>: Listen to me.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Why are you doing this now?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lomax</strong>: Because I’m afraid!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lomax</strong>: Kevin. Kevin! ‘Behold I send you out as
sheep amidst the wolves.’</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: Don’t you look beautiful now. Here. Have a look
and see.</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: It’s all right, dear. Look…</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: No. Please…</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: Go on. Take a look. See how beautiful you
are?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lomax</strong>: What’s going on?</p>

doctor in here!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lomax</strong>: – please – somebody – help her! – What
are you all doing? Somebody! –</p>

<p><strong>mrs. lomax</strong>: I could’ve packed that up for you.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lomax</strong>: I wish you’da let me help you.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Finish the story. Nineteen-sixty-four. You’re
in New York. There’s a waiter in a restaurant. Finish the story.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lomax</strong>: He talked to me. Nobody’d ever really
talked to me before. Sixteen years old, a thousand miles away from home,
somebody takes an interest… Working so hard, putting himself through
school, I’d never met anybody like that. Knew the Bible, every word,
just knew it by heart. Every meal, there he was, at my ear and I just… I
didn’t want that week to ever end. But it did. He came to say goodbye,
it was late, and I started to cry and he said not to worry, ‘Behold, I
send you out as sheep amidst the wolves.’ And that just stopped me cold
because we’d spent that whole day at Bible study reading Matthew Ten and
there was just no way for him to know about that, so I was… I took it as
a sign. I let him in. And then everything was different. He was cruel.
He was so cruel and I was so ashamed, I thought I’d die…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lomax</strong>: I promised right there if God would let
me back into His grace I would never leave again. I prayed there was a
reason this terrible thing had happened. There had to be a reason. And
there was. It was you. You were my blessing. You were reason enough to
endure anything. How much I love you.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I want to hear you say it.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lomax</strong>: His face – that night – I knew it was
him and the same time I was confused – and you were so proud you’d come
to New York and done all this on your own, I didn’t have the heart to
tell you –</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Say it.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lomax</strong>: – you wondered yourself – the apartment,
the money, all this attention, everything out of nowhere… Milton. He’s
your father. Somehow he found us. Tracked you down.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lomax</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: He’s always been there. I know that now.
Watching. Waiting. He’s been playing us like a game. Jerking us around.
Destroying Mary Ann…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lomax</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lomax</strong>: No… let it alone! Stay with me. Forget
about him! We can leave here. We can go home! We don’t ever have to see
him again!</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I can’t do that. You go home. Pray for Mary
Ann.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lomax</strong>: Kevin, please… Honey! I love you!</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: There you are… Look at you… you’re terrified.
Not to worry. He’ll take that fear away. You don’t ever have to be
frightened again. Go on, he’s waiting…</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: You’re right about one thing… I have been
watching. Couldn’t help myself. Watching, waiting, holding my breath.
But I’m no puppeteer, Kevin…</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: … I don’t make things happen. Doesn’t work
like that. Free will – it’s like butterfly wings – one touch and it
never gets off the ground. I only set the stage. You pull your own
strings.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: What did you do to Mary Ann?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: A gun? In here?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: What did you do to my wife?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: On a scale of one to ten, ten being the most
depraved acts of sexual theater, one being an average Friday night
run-through at the Lomax household, I’d say… Six.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Whoa… Got me! Damn! That’s my boy. Step on
up! Stay angry! Keep hold to that great fury! Hang on tight, Kevin,
because it’s the final fig leaf.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Never lost a case. Why? Why? Because you’re
so fucking good? Yes. But why?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Because you’re my father.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Well, I’m a little more than that. Awful hot
in that courtroom, wasn’t it? ‘What’s the game plan, Kevin?’ ‘It was a
nice run, Kevin. Had to close out someday.’</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: I have so many names.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Satan.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Call me Dad.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Mary Ann, Barzoon, Weaver…</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Come on. You’re not listening. Blaming me
for Mary Ann? I hope you’re kidding. You could’ve saved her any time you
liked. She only wanted love. But you knew it wouldn’t really work out,
didn’t you? Mary Ann in New York? Face it, you started looking to
better- deal her the minute you got here.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: That’s a lie.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Hey, it’s not that you didn’t care for her,
it’s just you were a little bit more involved with someone else.
Yourself.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: What the hell do you know about love?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Bio-chemically no different than eating
large quantities of chocolate. Don’t be such a fucking chump. There’s
only one real sickness in all of creation and that is self- delusion. I
told you to take care of your wife – that the world would understand.
And you made a choice. ‘You know what scares me, John? I leave the case,
she gets better and I hate her for it…’ Remember?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: You set me up. It’s entrapment.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Who told you to pull out the stops for
Mr. Gettys? And Moyez – the direction you took – Snake handlers, Popes
and swamis all feeding at the same trough – whose ideas were those? And
then Cullen – knowing he’s guilty – seeing those pictures – putting that
lying bitch on the stand… What did I say, Kevin? Maybe it was time to
lose, right? You didn’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: That’s my job. That’s what I do!</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Exactly! Vanity is definitely my favorite
sin. Self love. It’s so basic. What a drug. Cheap, all-natural, and
right at your fingertips. Pride. That’s where you’re strongest. And
believe me, I understand. Work for someone else? – Hey, I couldn’t hack
it. ‘Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven.’</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: What do you want from me?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: What do I want? I want you to be
yourself!</p>
<p><strong>251 omitted 251</strong>: &amp; &amp; 252 252</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: I’ve had many children, Kevin. So many
disappointments. Neurotic, indecisive wannabes. Over-eager, ham-handed
butchers. Strung-out, priapic losers. And then there’s you. Your mother,
I’ll tell you, she outstripped my wildest fantasy. That church she
dragged you to? Every day? What training. What a challenge! It’s awesome
what you’ve done. How far you’ve come. Both of you… You and your
sister.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Half-sister to be exact.</p>
<p><strong>christabella</strong>: Surprise.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: What do you think, Kevin? What a scene,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>christabella</strong>: Don’t let him scare you.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Wait till you meet her mother.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: It is a test, isn’t it? The whole game, you
sitting there, keeping score.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: No. That’s the other guy. I don’t judge
anybody. As far as I’m concerned, everyone’s a winner.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: God’s your prankster, my boy. Think of it.
He gives man instincts. He gives you this extraordinary gift and then, I
swear to you – for his own amusement – his own private, cosmic gag reel
– he sets the rules in opposition. It’s the goof of all time. Look but
don’t touch. Touch but don’t taste. Taste but don’t swallow. And while
you’re jumping from one foot to the other he’s laughing his sick fucking
ass off! He’s a tight-ass. He’s a sadist. He’s an absentee landlord!
Worship that? Never.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: I’m here, on the ground, my nose in it since
the whole damn thing began. Why? Because I worship man himself. And it’s
my time now. Our time.</p>
<p><strong>christabella</strong>: Anybody want a drink? I’m having a
drink.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: This is some pitch. You must need me pretty
bad. What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Eddie was right. Your name is on the
partnership charter. I want you to take over the firm. You and your
sister.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Is that it?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: No. She’s ovulating. Right now.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Your vanity is justified, Kevin, you’re the
seed to a new future. Your son will sit at the head of all tables. You
hold a special place in the history of all things.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: You want a child.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: I want a family.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: The Antichrist.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Whatever…</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: But I have to volunteer.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Free will. It’s a bitch. I need a family. I
command an ever larger presence on the board. I’m busy and I need some
help. There’s a plan here. I’ve been conserving my energy. Synergy.
Prioritize. It’s the millennium, Kevin. Title fight. Round twenty. I’m
ready to work.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: So what are you offering?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Are we negotiating?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Always.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: What are you offering?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Everything. Anything. All of it! What am I
offering? I’m offering bliss. Instant bliss. Bliss by remote control.
Bliss on tap. That first line of cocaine. That walk into a strange
girl’s bedroom. The jury coming back in thirty- eight minutes. Freedom.
Revolution! Viva la causa!</p>
<p><strong>257 omitted 257</strong>: thru thru 259 259</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: You’re right, aren’t you? About me. I mean, I
made all the choices, didn’t I? Gettys. Cullen. Mary Ann. I did kill
her, didn’t I?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Don’t be too hard on yourself.</p>
<p><strong>christabella</strong>: It’s done. Forget it. It’s all for us
now.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: God, she’s just fucking stunning, isn’t
she?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: You’re right. I wanted to fuck her from the
minute we met.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Like that’s wrong. Like there’s anything
wrong with that. That there could be laws preventing something so
natural. That’s our ticket in. Did you know there were more students in
law school right now than lawyers walking the Earth?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: We’re coming out, guns blazing. The two of
you – all of us – acquittal after acquittal until the stench of it
reaches so high into heaven it chokes the whole fucking lot of them!
What we cannot legislate we will buy. What we cannot buy we will
degrade. We will blow every fuse of enlightenment until it looks like a
vandalized, neon sign! And while God is busy at his peephole – as he
deigns us with his disapproval – as he lumbers around his empty kingdom
like some overfed colonial governor – as God sleeps late, we will win.
We’ve got a winner here, kids!</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: In the Bible you lose. You’re destined to
lose.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Consider the source.</p>
<p><strong>christabella</strong>: Stop talking. Both of you. Kevin,
please…</p>
<p><strong>christabella</strong>: Kevin, really, please…</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: She’s right, my son. It’s time to step up
and take what’s yours.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: You’re right. It’s time.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Nooooooo…!</p>
<p><strong>266 omitted 266</strong>: &amp; &amp; 267 267</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: It was a nice run. Kev. Had to close out
someday. Nobody wins ’em all.</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: Honey, what are you doing? Are you
okay?</p>
<p><strong>bailiff</strong>: All rise for the honorable Justice Garson
Deeds.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: You’re still under oath, young lady.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Your witness, Mr. Lomax.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Your Honor, I’m terribly sorry, but I can no
longer represent my client. I need to be replaced as counsel.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Kevin! – Hey! Listen, this story – this is
the one, pal – this is the one you dream about –</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: There is no story.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Bullshit. A lawyer with a crisis of
conscience? You gotta be kidding. It’s huge!</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: They’re gonna disbar me, Larry. You can cover
that.</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: Can they do that?</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Not when I get through with the story. You
gotta talk, Kevin. You gotta gimme an exclusive.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: This is wire service. This is ‘Sixty
Minutes’. This is a story that needs to be told. It’s you! You’re a
star!</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Call me tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: You got it. First thing.</p>
