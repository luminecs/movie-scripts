<h1 id="heavy-metal">heavy-metal</h1>
<p><strong>screenplay by</strong>: Dan Goldberg</p>
<p><strong>a wheatfield</strong>: A beautiful field of wheat glistens in
the morning sun. As the camera skims overtop, titles start to roll.
Ahead of us an odd-looking service van comes into view, sputtering along
a dirt road. Getting closer, we can see the driver, a thin, bookish man
with a neat mustache. This is AUSTIN GRIMALDI.</p>
<p><strong>the attic window</strong>: The curtains part ever so
slightly, and a pair of eyes peer down.</p>
<p><strong>the van</strong>: AUSTIN shuts the van’s rear doors, and
carries the two metal boxes into the house. The titles stop rolling as
we;</p>
<p><strong>inside the house</strong>: AUSTIN is reading a schematic
diagram as he sits in front of the exposed chassis of a complicated
futuristic electronic contraption, twice his size. There are strange
tools all over the floor.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Hmmmm ….</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Uh - oh ….</p>
<p><strong>space</strong>: With an explosion that rocks the universe, a
huge chunk rips out of the green planet and shoots off into space,
leaving thousands of glowing particles in its wake.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Not noticing the silent image on the
holograph, he quickly repairs the sparkling connection and returns to
his other adjustments.</p>
<p><strong>a forest</strong>: From the forest floor we see the green
planetoid fly overhead, dropping balls. We watch as it moves away and
disappears beyond a far-off mountain range. The forest rumbles as the
planetoid crashes in the distance.</p>
<p><strong>a green ball near her feet</strong>: An ominous note is
struck as the girl notices the glowing ball, and is drawn to it. Picking
the sphere up, she looks at it. Something inside her warns her of its
danger, but, unable to resist, she puts it in her basket and continues
on.</p>
<p><strong>the gates of kraan</strong>: Night falls over this futuristic
chromoid city as the beautiful girl passes through the glass gates and
heads home.</p>
<p><strong>the girl’s bedroom</strong>: The girl yawns and gets into bed
as the camera pans over to her basket in the corner. Through its side,
the green ball begins to glow brightly.</p>
<p><strong>the outlands</strong>: Flying quickly overtop futuristic
villages, the camera heads further and further out into the less
civilized sectors, where the rusting pipelines and crumbling utility
stations of a past civilization have been overgrown by scrub-bush and
weeds.</p>
<p><strong>the line of barbarians</strong>: At the front of the line,
the largest barbarian - obviously their leader - stops and points.</p>
<p><strong>the mountains</strong>: A strange, green, foamy liquid comes
pouring down the mountains toward the barbarians.</p>
<p><strong>the line of barbarians</strong>: The barbarians stand frozen
as the foam washes over them and keeps on going. One by one, their eyes
turn green and they start to change, becoming hairier, uglier, and
stronger.</p>
<p><strong>the gates of kraan</strong>: A frightened Kraanian councillor
spurs his horse forward through the beautiful glass gates, as in the
distance we hear the sound of ten thousand approaching footsteps.</p>
<p><strong>the barbarian leader</strong>: He is now wearing a strange
medallion around his neck as, wild- eyed, he screams to signal the
attack. The bloodthirsty horde charges down the hill behind him.</p>
<p><strong>the council chambers</strong>: At the far end of this huge
glass hall, the Kraanian Council sits around a marble table. From
outside, we hear the battle raging.</p>
<p><strong>councilman #3</strong>: They’re killing everyone. We must
escape!</p>
<p><strong>councilman #2</strong>: The city is burning!</p>
<p><strong>councilman #4</strong>: Even the mountains glow green and an
evil slime oozes down!</p>
<p><strong>councilman #1</strong>: Elder, we must arm ourselves! We must
fight!</p>
<p><strong>elder</strong>: Silence!</p>
<p><strong>elder</strong>: We are not a race of warriors. We are
statesmen, and scientists. From our very beginning it was ordained that
the warrior-race of Taarak the Defender would aid us in times of need.
This was the Pact!</p>
<p><strong>councilman #1</strong>: Taarak the Defender? His race is
dead! They cannot defend anyone!</p>
<p><strong>councilman #2</strong>: Some say that the race is not dead -
that one still lives.</p>
<p><strong>councilman #1</strong>: One? What good is one?</p>
<p><strong>elder</strong>: One of Taarak’s blood can do much.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Elder! They are at the walls!</p>
<p><strong>councilman #3</strong>: Well who is this last Defender? How
can he be summoned?</p>
<p><strong>elder</strong>: It is Taarna, of the blood of Taarak the
Defender - the last of the race. And must be summoned as my forefathers
summoned Taarak himself - from within!</p>
<p><strong>councilman #2</strong>: But will this Defender answer?</p>
<p><strong>elder</strong>: A Taarakian has no choice. They must answer.
It is in their blood.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: They are in the halls! They are coming!!</p>
<p><strong>elder</strong>: Bar the door. We will summon the Defender
together.</p>
<p><strong>elder</strong>: Taarna … Taarna …</p>
<p><strong>the door</strong>: As the boy begins to bar the door, it
bursts open, flinging him aside. Standing in the doorway, surrounded by
his men, is the BARBARIAN LEADER.</p>
<p><strong>the outlands</strong>: We look down over this uncivilized
wilderness with only decaying pipelines and the occasional jagged rock
structure breaking the barren uniformity of the land. As the Council’s
distant chanting fades out, all is quiet.</p>
<p><strong>taarna’s face</strong>: She is beautiful, with dark eyes and
wild red hair blowing behind her in the wind.</p>
<p><strong>humanoid</strong>: I owe you my life. Let me repay you …</p>
<p><strong>austin grimaldi</strong>: He is still sitting on the floor,
working on his machine. As the camera pulls closer, we see that AUSTIN
is reaching deep inside the machineworks, trying to solder a small
orange diode in place with an odd-style soldering iron. The connection
breaks, and the diode and some hot solder fall deeper into the machine
and start smoking and sputtering. As the smoke grows thicker, the
machine starts to buzz loudly.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Dammit!</p>
<p>****: Where the hell are we?</p>
<p><strong>the ground below</strong>: The sound of jungle night
creatures fills the air. We see palm trees silhouetted against the moon
bright sky. The scene is almost serene. The camera pans and suddenly the
nose of a large parked bomber fills the screen, and as the camera
continues panning, we pass a large red rising sun on the bomber’s
fuselage. The pan stops at the tail of the aircraft, and we see a
Japanese soldier - a guard.</p>
<p><strong>a gun emplacement</strong>: Japanese soldiers crank the
barrel of an anti-aircraft gun skyward. We begin to hear the sound of
approaching engines.</p>
<p><strong>closeup of a shell</strong>: It is thrust into a breech.</p>
<p><strong>the b-17 formation</strong>: As the bombers press on, the
camera moves in to the lead aircraft. In the moonlight we see her name,
“Pacific Pearl”.</p>
<p><strong>navigator</strong>: We’re there Stepek, right on target …
Rabual dead ahead!</p>
<p><strong>bombardier</strong>: Gee! Thanks for telling me, Holden. I
thought it was Cleveland.</p>
<p><strong>the ground</strong>: Ackack guns blast shells skyward. The
gun blasts light up the palm tree background, causing momentary
silhouettes.</p>
<p><strong>bombardier</strong>: For Christ sake, hold her steady!</p>
<p><strong>the bellygunner</strong>: He can be seen from outside the
plane as the shell flashes light up his turret.</p>
<p><strong>bellygunner</strong>: Quit yer bitching Stepek, just drop ’em
and let’s get outta here!</p>
<p><strong>bombardier</strong>: Keep your shirts on guys, tonight I’m
gonna hit something. Left two degrees … steady … steady …</p>
<p><strong>the bellygunner</strong>: The flak is severe, with electric
blue flashes lighting up the fuselage interior.</p>
<p><strong>bellygunner</strong>: Hey kid, how ya doing back there?</p>
<p><strong>the tailgunner</strong>: Tailgunner momentarily lit with a
shell burst, he’s scared shitless. He looks nervously back behind the
aircraft at the flak puffs behind the tail.</p>
<p><strong>tailgunner</strong>: Gulp, ah … I’m ah … okay … I think.</p>
<p>****: Button it up, we’re almost there.</p>
<p><strong>the bombardier</strong>: He is crouched over his bomb-sights,
concentrating.</p>
<p>****: C’mon Stepek, there’s the whole island of Rabaul down there,
you can’t miss!</p>
<p><strong>bombardier</strong>: Screw you …</p>
<p><strong>the pilot’s compartment</strong>: Suddenly a shell explodes
almost on the windshield and the pilot rears back with the blast. The
right windshield is shattered.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: We took a hit …</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Shit. Elkhorn just bought it.</p>
<p>****: We took one back here too. C’mon Stepek, blast ’em!</p>
<p><strong>bombardier</strong>: Steady … steady … bombs away! Let’s get
the hell outta here!</p>
<p><strong>the ground</strong>: We hear the shriek of descending bombs.
The explosions walk across the airfield, and in the light of the
explosions we see devastation. The last bomb hits a fuel dump, causing
an enormous ball of fire.</p>
<p>****: Yahoo! Bullseye!</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Nice shooting Stepek, how are the rest of you
guys?</p>
<p>****: Flight Engineer okay.</p>
<p>****: Radio okay.</p>
<p>****: Navigator check.</p>
<p>****: Belly okay.</p>
<p>****: Ah … tail okay …</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Bellson … Lewis?</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Kid, check the waist positions, see if
they’re okay.</p>
<p><strong>tailgunner</strong>: Yeah … will do, skipper.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Let’s go home.</p>
<p>****: Cheers and whoops.</p>
<p>****: Skipper, Bellson and Lewis are both dead.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Dammit!</p>
<p>****: Well kid, now you got a real bombing mission under your
belt.</p>
<p><strong>the bombardier</strong>: He removes his oxygen mask and takes
a long swig from a bottle.</p>
<p><strong>ext. - the “pacific pearl”</strong>: She rejoins the rest of
the group. The formation is not quite as tight as before. As the
formation flies along, puffs of cloud pass by, occasionally obscuring a
machine.</p>
<p><strong>low view of the “pacific pearl”</strong>: Under the “Pacific
Pearl’s” belly, we see the bellygunner suspended in his small glass pod.
A red glow brightens up as he drags on a cigar. The rest of the
formation are visible stretched to the side and behind as puffs of cloud
waft past. We begin to feel as if the weather might be changing.</p>
<p><strong>the nose of the “pacific pearl”</strong>: The BOMBARDIER is
relaxing inside as he swigs from the bottle and sings raucously. From
the front we look in on the pilot with the dead co-pilot sagging in his
seat next to him.</p>
<p>****: Sorry about Elkhorn, skip. What happened?</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: I dunno. The shell exploded and he collapsed.
I think he took it in the head.</p>
<p>****: Are ya sure he’s dead, Skipper?</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: He’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>bombardier</strong>: Oh I put my finger in a woodpecker’s
hole and the woodpecker said God bless my soul; take it out, take it
out, take it out, remove it …</p>
<p><strong>tailgunner</strong>: Hey Stepek, just shut up, okay?</p>
<p><strong>bombardier</strong>: Up yours kid, wassa matter, you don’t
like my voice?</p>
<p>****: Something’s wrong!</p>
<p><strong>the navigator</strong>: He is frantically tapping the
compass.</p>
<p>****: You got a problem, Holden?</p>
<p>****: Naw, the kid’s the one with the problem. He don’t like my
voice!</p>
<p>****: Button it up Stepek. What’s the problem, Holden?</p>
<p><strong>navigator</strong>: I must have a malfunction, my compass
says we’re heading north!</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: He looks at his compass.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Mine says east.</p>
<p>****: Hey, can you guys see the rest of the squadron?</p>
<p>****: Negative, there’s too much cloud.</p>
<p><strong>the cockpit</strong>: The dead co-pilot’s pale face is
momentarily electric blue, lit by the lightning flash. We pan past him
to the compass in the instrument panel. It is spinning madly.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: What the hell …</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Hey Holden, now my compass has gone crazy.
It’s spinning like a son of a bitch!</p>
<p>****: Mine too, we must have hit a magnetic field or something !!</p>
<p><strong>outside the plane</strong>: We see a dull glow coming from
all crew positions from the on-board lights. Suddenly a curtain of rain
lashes the machine.</p>
<p>****: Christ, now they’re all doing it!!</p>
<p><strong>the instrument panel</strong>: All the dials are going
haywire. Above the instrument panel we see the windshield is spattered
with rain.</p>
<p>****: You guys quit talking business? I’m trying to sing here! Oh I
put my finger in a woodpecker’s …</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Can it Stepek, we got real problems.</p>
<p><strong>outside the plane - near belly turret</strong>: The turret
swings as the gunner spots the glow.</p>
<p><strong>bellygunner</strong>: Jesus! Look at that!!</p>
<p>****: Look at what … look at what!!?</p>
<p><strong>bellygunner</strong>: It’s out there, just look at it …</p>
<p>****: For Christ sake, give us a position!</p>
<p><strong>bellygunner</strong>: It’s about four o’clock, just below …
Holy Shit, it’s coming right at us!</p>
<p><strong>pilot’s pov</strong>: He has to push the dead co-pilot back
to peer out the broken starboard window … the number three prop is bent
and windmilling wildly. It has a strange green luminescence about it …
the whole machine shakes.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Damn.</p>
<p><strong>outside the plane</strong>: The prop flies back and slices a
great gash in the aircraft’s skin, near the TAILGUNNER’S position.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: We lost the goddamned prop … Did it do any
damage? Kid, check the tail.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Come in kid … kid are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Travis; go check the back.</p>
<p>****: Will do, skipper.</p>
<p><strong>inside hatch</strong>: TRAVIS’ turret opens and TRAVIS pulls
himself up into the fuselage.</p>
<p><strong>the pilot</strong>: The gauges are now settled except for the
oil pressure to No. 2 engine. The pressure drops. The engine heat gauge
climbs rapidly. A red warning light begins to flash.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Goddamn it, now what?</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Gremlins! Jesus, I must be getting tired.</p>
<p><strong>the bellygunner</strong>: He looks in to the kid’s reargun
compartment. All that is left of him is a tattered skeleton.</p>
<p>****: Travis, what’s goin’ on back there?</p>
<p><strong>travis</strong>: His eyes are open but he is obviously dead.
Through his helmet headphone, we hear his name.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Holden, how far to base?</p>
<p>****: Skip, with everything screwed up here, I’d, I’d guess about two
hundred miles.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: For Christ’s sake, find us a place I can put
her down!</p>
<p><strong>navigator</strong>: It’s all ocean down there, skip!</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Mack, can you get us a radio fix?</p>
<p><strong>radio operator</strong>: Negative skip, too much
interference.</p>
<p><strong>the pilot</strong>: He is fighting the controls.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Shit! I’ve gotta put her down!</p>
<p><strong>bombardier</strong>: Hey Holden … ya old stuff shirt … ya
wanna snort?</p>
<p>****: For God sakes Stepek, shut up!</p>
<p><strong>bombardier</strong>: Oh my God, there’s … there’s … ahh …
keep away … keep away … … hey no … hey somebody …</p>
<p>****: Stepek, you stupid sonovabitch, will you lay off the booze,
you’ve got the D.T.’s …</p>
<p><strong>outside the aircraft</strong>: The lower half of STEPEK is
hanging in the slipstream, kicking madly. We see that his legs are
covered in wriggling creatures.</p>
<p><strong>stepek</strong>: He is losing his grip with one hand, but
still desperately clinging on to a bunch of cables with the other.
Suddenly an ugly pincer cuts the cables and STEPEK is gone … out into
the night.</p>
<p><strong>the plane</strong>: Suddenly the No. 2 engine begins to
backfire, blasting back large gobs of orange flame. The oil, heat and
manifold gauges are off the dial and red lights frantically flash.
Desperately the PILOT looks out of the window.</p>
<p><strong>the pilot</strong>: He is scared.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Holden, for God’s sake get up here on the
double.</p>
<p>****: What’s the problem, skip?</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Just get up here!</p>
<p><strong>navigator</strong>: What is it, skip?</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Hold ’em off. I’m taking her down.</p>
<p><strong>navigator</strong>: Okay you little bastards … shit …</p>
<p><strong>the radio operator</strong>: The flare shoots down the
fuselage and smashes into him. Wreathed in flames, he falls back into
the fuselage.</p>
<p><strong>outside the aircraft</strong>: Creatures swarm all over the
plane. The ball turret falls off. A wheel suddenly lowers, then falls
off. A flap flutters free and blows away. Oil streams back into the
slipstream and sections of the skin of the plane come away, revealing
the skeleton framework of the fuselage.</p>
<p><strong>the pilot</strong>: He is fighting the controls. Creatures
are now in the cockpit, plucking out the instruments. The PILOT reaches
to the throttle only to grab a creature that locks on to his gloved
hand. Flying the plane with his good hand, he strikes and pummels at the
attacking creatures with the other.</p>
<p><strong>outside the aircraft</strong>: It is now almost a flying
skeleton. For the first time, we see that it is heading for an island. A
figure detaches itself from the machine and plummets away.</p>
<p><strong>the pilot</strong>: He falls, terror-stricken, through space.
Finally his chute opens. A slimy creature still clings to his gloved
hand. He rips off the glove and throws it and the creature away.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Jesus H. Christ!</p>
<p><strong>the island</strong>: The approaching smoking plane bellies
onto the sea, bounces, then skims along the wave tops, careening up onto
the beach, where it twists around crazily before coming to a lopsided
stop. The machine faces us head-on and we see a glow coming from what’s
left of No. 3 engine. The camera zooms in rapidly to a green ball stuck
in engine No. 3.</p>
<p><strong>the pilot</strong>: He has landed, and is undoing his
parachute harness. He looks around incredulously. The island is a
junkyard - a veritable graveyard of aircrafts. There are many aircrafts,
both old wrecks and futuristic-looking ones lying everywhere. Skeletal
corpses are still left in some of the wrecks. The camera pans to the
remains of one machine. It is an old American Lockheed Electra. It
glints dull in the half light of dawn. Painted on its side are two
names; “Amelia Earhart” and “Fred Noonan”.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Got it.</p>
<p><strong>little girl</strong>: It’s broken again, isn’t it Daddy?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Yes dear. But Daddy’s fixing it.</p>
<p><strong>little girl</strong>: How come it’s always breaking?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: I don’t know, sweetheart. Mmmmhmm.</p>
<p><strong>little girl</strong>: When it’s fixed, will you make more
funny pictures for me?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Honey, why don’t you go play with your toys
and let Daddy finish his work, okay? Mmmm …</p>
<p><strong>little girl</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>the gates of kraan</strong>: The Council’s voices still
ringing in her head, TAARNA flies in over the demolished gates. Below
her, the once-beautiful city lies in ruins.</p>
<p><strong>outside the council building</strong>: TAARNA flies back out
through the shattered dome and surveys the city below. All is quiet and
dark, except for a green glow coming from a second-floor window.
Curious, she flies over, pulls up beside the window, and climbs in.</p>
<p><strong>girl’s bedroom</strong>: Entering, TAARNA sees the slimy
silk-like cocoon on the bed. The basket of fruit still sits on the
floor. From within the webbing, the green ball is glowing brightly.</p>
<p><strong>witch</strong>: Behold! The Sphere of Uluhtec! Look upon it,
Taarna. Look upon it with fear. For in its glow lies the end of heaven -
the beginning of hell. Take it Taarna. Feel death in your hands. For
death is upon you. And as you perish … so dies your race!</p>
<p><strong>witch</strong>: Take it !!</p>
<p><strong>space</strong>: The WITCH’S green ball zooms through space,
as Earth appears in the distance. Then another object comes into sight.
Getting closer we see that is is a modern winged rocketplane of no
determinable nationality, soaring high above Earth. The green meteorite
passes, briefly bathing the rocketplane in its glow.</p>
<p><strong>ext. the pentagon - aerial shot</strong>: From high above the
building we see a crowd of reporters and T.V. newsmen waiting on the
front steps.</p>
<p><strong>female reporter</strong>: Doctor Anrak, six more mutants were
sighted in Arizona this morning. Do you still say this has nothing to do
with the green radiation from space.</p>
<p><strong>t.v. newsman</strong>: Doctor, is it true that the President
himself pulled you off the Jupiter Six Project so that you could
investigate those mutations? Doctor, answer me that.</p>
<p><strong>int. pentagon - meeting room</strong>: Around a large table
sit the Joint Chiefs of Staff, members of the Cabinet, and a pretty
secretary wearing a tight skirt. An argument is in progress as the
expressionless DOCTOR ANRAK enters. The camera follows him as he sits
down next to one of the Generals.</p>
<p><strong>fat politician</strong>: … well what I wanna know is, what’s
the Army doing about this? Hell! My constiuents are turning green!
They’re growing arms on their backs. There’s something or someone up
there in space and the voters have a right to know about it!</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Senator, we have no proof that these
mutations are the result of interference from outer space. In fact,
Doctor Anrak has just come in, so let’s hear what he has to say …
Doctor?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: First of all, there is no cause for alarm.
As for the theories of interference by alien beings, it is my firm
opinion that we on Earth are the only intelligent, technically advanced
civilization present in the universe.</p>
<p><strong>outside the pentagon</strong>: An enormous round spaceship
the size of Pittsburg hovers overhead.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: … and whatever is causing these mutations is
not from outer space. it’s more likely just an isolated biological pheno
… pheno … ph … ph … ph …</p>
<p><strong>outside the pentagon</strong>: From the bottom of the huge
spacecraft, a metal tube emerges and starts to drill through the roof of
the Pentagon.</p>
<p><strong>the meeting room</strong>: The DOCTOR starts to shake
violently as he stares at the pretty secretary.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Pretty … pretty … p … p …</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Aaarrgghh!</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Eeeeeek!</p>
<p><strong>inside the spacecraft - control room</strong>: A metallic
robot holding a clipboard, is standing in front of a large glass
receiving jar, as DOCTOR ANRAK comes through the tube and lands in the
jar. As soon as the DOCTOR’S feet hit the bottom of the jar, the DOCTOR
breaks into a lot of small metallic parts.</p>
<p><strong>robot</strong>: Oh, nice job. How am I supposed to fix this
guy? He’s fucked.</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: I guess we turned it up a little too high.</p>
<p><strong>edsel</strong>: Sorry, man.</p>
<p><strong>robot</strong>: You’re sorry? What about me? I’ve gotta put
this asshole back together.</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: Where am I?</p>
<p><strong>robot</strong>: Hey, who’s the chick?</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: Well look at my clothes! Who’s gonna pay for
the dry cleaning? And where am I? I demand that you return me to my
office immediately.</p>
<p><strong>robot</strong>: Too late - molecular instability zone around
spacecraft. You cannot leave.</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: What?! Is he kidding?</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: Uh …</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: … oh yeah. Instability zone. You’re stuck
here.</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: But I have to be at my parents for dinner
tonight. And my gynecologist appointment is on Wednesday.</p>
<p><strong>robot</strong>: Not anymore. Would you, ah, like a drink?
You’ll feel better after a glass of fresh blo-aak.</p>
<p>****: Do you have any diet soda?</p>
<p><strong>edsel</strong>: Ah, typical robot. The first Earth-chick we
see in ten years, and he’s gotta make a play for her.</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: Hey, do we have any of that Plutonian Nyborg
left?</p>
<p><strong>edsel</strong>: Uh, yeah. Just one bag. Uh, it’s in the
transmitter compartment.</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: Uh, thanks man.</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: Oh great. Think this is enough?</p>
<p><strong>edsel</strong>: Uhh … nah. Go for broke.</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: Good thinking, man.</p>
<p><strong>zeke &amp; edsel</strong>: Nose dive!</p>
<p><strong>space - zeke and edsel’s p.o.v.</strong>: As the round
spaceship moves through space, a group of asteroids approach and whip
past. Up ahead, a red sun turns white and goes super-nova.</p>
<p>****: Oh, wow … good Nyborg!</p>
<p><strong>inside the spacecraft - robot’s bedroom</strong>: GLORIA
PEARLMAN and the ROBOT are lying in bed, naked. They have just finished
making love. She is smoking a cigarette.</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: That was incredible. I’ve never felt
anything like it.</p>
<p><strong>robot</strong>: Oh great. I have been programmed to be fully
proficient in sexual activities. Do you want to go steady?</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: Gee, I don’t know. I already have a
boyfriend.</p>
<p><strong>robot</strong>: Ah, what he does not know will not hurt
him.</p>
<p><strong>control console</strong>: ZEKE and EDSEL are sitting at the
controls, staring wide-eyed out into space. They are obviously stoned.
Suddenly a bell rings and the communicator screen lights up. A serious
officer’s face appears on it.</p>
<p><strong>officer on screen</strong>: Mothership calling starcruiser
Alpha … Mothership calling starcruiser Alpha …</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: Whaddyawant, man?</p>
<p><strong>officer on screen</strong>: Mothership calling Starcruiser
Alpha …</p>
<p><strong>edsel</strong>: You gotta use the microphone.</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: Oh yeah. Whaddyawant man?</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Now listen, idiot. Do I have to tell you
eight hundred times? You don’t call me “man”! You call me “Com-Op
Officer Blix”. Now is that perfectly clear?</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: Yeah, sure. Whaddyawant, man?</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: You are to return immediately to the Mother
Ship and pick up a humanoid civilian. Your orders are to escort him to
the Interplanetary Tribunal Courtroom so that he can testify at the
trial of Lincoln Sternn. And make it snappy!</p>
<p><strong>edsel</strong>: Wow! They finally got Sternn.</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: It’s about time. Hang on, man. Here we go.</p>
<p><strong>space</strong>: The round spaceship blasts forward at ten
times the speed of light.</p>
<p><strong>space - later</strong>: ZEKE and EDSEL’S round spacecraft
looks like an apple heading toward a freight train as it approaches the
enormous mother-ship.</p>
<p><strong>inside spacecraft - control console</strong>: An ashtray full
of roaches sits on the console. ZEKE is at the controls with a joint in
his mouth. He is swaying back and forth, eyes glazed. Beside him, EDSEL
watches the mothership getting closer.</p>
<p><strong>edsel</strong>: You okay to land this thing?</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: No problem, man.</p>
<p><strong>mothership’s landing area</strong>: Huge red arrows point the
way through the ten-mile wide landing area as the round spaceship glides
in.</p>
<p>****: I think you’re goin’ a little high, man.</p>
<p>****: It’s okay, man. If there’s one thing I know, it’s how to drive
when I’m stoned. It’s like, you know your perspective’s fucked, so you
just gotta let your hands work the controls as if you’re straight.</p>
<p>****: Oh, wow, good landing, man.</p>
<p>****: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>inside spacecraft - entrance hatch</strong>: ZEKE and EDSEL
press a button to open the hatch doors. As the door opens we see two
metallic Regolian guards waiting on the other side. Between them stands
a small, shabbily-dressed humanoid with a crooked jaw and cauliflower
ears. This is HANOVER FISTE.</p>
<p><strong>regolian guard</strong>: This man is to be delivered to the,
clik, Interplanetary Tribunal, Courtroom #3, clik, Galaxy versus Lincoln
Sternn. Thenk yew. Clik.</p>
<p><strong>fiste</strong>: Ah, hello.</p>
<p><strong>corridor in spaceship</strong>: ZEKE and EDSEL escort FISTE
down the corridor.</p>
<p><strong>edsel</strong>: Umm, you’re gonna testify at Sternn’s
trial?</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: They gotta give him at least, like, life.</p>
<p><strong>fiste</strong>: Lincoln Sternn is a kind and honourable man.
He will be freed.</p>
<p><strong>space - later</strong>: As the round spaceship journeys
through space it passes through a fantastic space-scape of disembodied
rock statues, and past a magnificent graffiti-covered robot chained to
an asteroid.</p>
<p>****: Y’know, I wish they’d clean this place up, man.</p>
<p>****: Yeah. It’s like pig city out here.</p>
<p>****: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>robot’s bedroom</strong>: GLORIA is getting dressed as the
ROBOT re-charges his energy- paks.</p>
<p><strong>robot</strong>: … but I don’t understand. We laugh together.
We care for each other. We have highly proficient sex. Why can’t we get
married?</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: Look, we’re different, okay? Let’s leave it
at that.</p>
<p><strong>control room</strong>: The hatch opens, and GLORIA and the
ROBOT walk through, still talking.</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: … but mixed marriages just don’t work. What
if you get tired of me and run off with a vibrator or something?</p>
<p><strong>control console</strong>: ZEKE and EDSEL are sitting at the
controls, driving carefully. FISTE, carrying the green ball, comes up
and sits down beside them.</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: There it is, man. I’m gonna hang a louie
here.</p>
<p><strong>edsel</strong>: Yeah, well it won’t be long now. Are you sure
you’re gonna testify for Sternn.</p>
<p><strong>outside the spaceship</strong>: An enormous, brightly-lit,
multi-level space station/courthouse floats into view, completely
filling the screen. ZEKE and EDSEL’S round spaceship is just a speck as
it enters the frame, approaching the mammoth structure.</p>
<p><strong>space-station landing dock</strong>: The ship locks into the
dock, and the exit hatch opens. GLORIA and the ROBOT come through first,
ahead of ZEKE, EDSEL, and FISTE.</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: … alright, alright. I’ll marry you - but on
one condition … I want a Jewish wedding.</p>
<p><strong>robot</strong>: A Jewish wedding!?!!! But this is space. 95%
of the population are robots.</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: Well, find me a robot-rabbi!</p>
<p><strong>robot</strong>: Okay, okay!</p>
<p><strong>edsel</strong>: I give them six months, man.</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: He doesn’t even look Jewish!</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: Are you Captain Lincoln F. Sternn?</p>
<p><strong>sternn</strong>: I am.</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: Lincoln Sternn - you stand here accused
of twelve counts of murder in the first degree … fourteen counts of
armed theft of Federation property …</p>
<p><strong>the gallery</strong>: The hostile humanoid and alien faces
all stare at STERNN with hateful, accusing eyes.</p>
<p>****: … twenty-two counts of piracy in high space … eighteen counts
of fraud …</p>
<p><strong>sternn’s lawyer</strong>: Mopping his brow, he looks
nervously over to STERNN.</p>
<p>****: … thirty-seven counts of rape, and one moving violation. How do
you plead?</p>
<p><strong>captain sternn</strong>: Smiling to himself, he nods, then
gets serious.</p>
<p><strong>sternn</strong>: Not guilty!</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: Not guilty?!? Are you nuts?!?</p>
<p><strong>sternn</strong>: It’s okay, Charlie. I got an angle.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Call the first witness!</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: But the Prosecutor’s gotcha cold! Yer as
guilty as a cat in a goldfish bowl.</p>
<p><strong>the courtroom doors</strong>: ZEKE and EDSEL enter with
FISTE, and push their way to the front.</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: The Prosecution calls Hanover Fiste.</p>
<p><strong>guard #1</strong>: Calling Hanover Fiste!</p>
<p><strong>guard #2</strong>: Calling Hanover Fiste!</p>
<p><strong>guard #3</strong>: Calling Hanover Fiste!</p>
<p><strong>guard #4</strong>: Hanover Fiste!</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: Lissen Sternn … change the plea to guilty.
Throw yerself on the mercy of the court.</p>
<p><strong>sternn</strong>: I told you, Charlie. I got an angle.</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: But the most we can hope for is to get ya
buried in secrecy so yer grave don’t get violated! Plead guilty!</p>
<p><strong>sternn</strong>: Shut up, Charlie. I got an angle.</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: What angle?</p>
<p><strong>sternn</strong>: Him!</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: State your name for the record.</p>
<p><strong>fiste</strong>: I am Hanover Fiste.</p>
<p><strong>sternn</strong>: I promised him thirty-five thousand zuleks
to testify on my behalf.</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: You know the defendant, Captain
Sternn?</p>
<p><strong>fiste</strong>: Yes, I know Captain Sternn. And never did
there live a kinder, more generous man. He is an overflowing cup, filled
with the very cream of human goodness …</p>
<p><strong>sternn</strong>: See?</p>
<p><strong>fiste</strong>: … in all the time I’ve known him, he’s never
done anything immoral … unless maybe the Pre-Schooler’s Prostitute ring
…</p>
<p><strong>sternn and his lawyer</strong>: They look at each other,
shocked.</p>
<p><strong>sternn &amp; lawyer</strong>: Huh?!?</p>
<p><strong>fiste</strong>: … and he’s ah, never done anything illegal …
… unless you count all the times he sold dope disguised as a nun!! He’s
always been a good, law-abiding citizen … Awww, gimme a break!! … of the
Federation, and, and … Shut Up! Shut Up! Shut Up! … a community-concious
individual, ah, ah …</p>
<p><strong>sternn!!!</strong>: He’s nothin’ but a low-down,
double-dealin’, back-stabbin’, larcenous, perverted worm!!</p>
<p><strong>fiste</strong>: Hangin’s too good for him!!</p>
<p><strong>fiste</strong>: Burnin’s too good for him!!</p>
<p><strong>sternn</strong>: Hanover …</p>
<p><strong>fiste</strong>: He should be torn into little bitsy pieces
and buried alive!!!</p>
<p><strong>sternn</strong>: Hanover …</p>
<p><strong>fiste</strong>: I’ll kill him!</p>
<p><strong>sternn</strong>: H-h-hey, Hanover … n-now take it easy,
Hanover, I’m sure we can talk this ov …</p>
<p><strong>sternn</strong>: Running down a hallway, STERNN passes a
group of Regolian cops, who raise their weapons in an attempt to block
the rampaging FISTE.</p>
<p><strong>regolian #1</strong>: Halt, clik, in the name of the
Federation, clik. Where is your corridor pass? Unco-operative humanoid,
clik, blast him.</p>
<p><strong>regolian #1</strong>: You are now in violation of Code
103-N-17, clik, paragraph A-64 … unauthorized consumption of Federation
property. Please come quietly, clik, … thenk yew.</p>
<p><strong>sternn</strong>: He races through a metallic hallway, and
ducks into a boiler room, then down a long dark tunnel. At the end of
the tunnel, STERNN comes to a dead-end, and stops to rest.</p>
<p><strong>sternn</strong>: Oh, this looks good.</p>
<p><strong>sternn</strong>: Oh, duck under here …</p>
<p><strong>fiste</strong>: I’ll get you!!</p>
<p><strong>sternn</strong>: I think I’ll turn here! Come on feet, don’t
fail me now!</p>
<p><strong>fiste</strong>: Sternn!!!</p>
<p><strong>sternn</strong>: Uh oh … Ah, gasp, ah whew, lost him!</p>
<p><strong>sternn</strong>: Okay, Hanover, you’ve had this coming!</p>
<p><strong>sternn</strong>: Let’s see, thirty-three, thirty- four,
thirty-five thousand zuleks. Thanks Hanover.</p>
<p><strong>fiste</strong>: S’nothin, boss.</p>
<p><strong>sternn</strong>: And Hanover …</p>
<p><strong>fiste</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>sternn</strong>: Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>the outlands</strong>: All is quiet across this vast expanse
of rusted pipes and barren desert. The silence is broken by a whistling
sound which gets louder and louder. Then, thud!</p>
<p><strong>taarna</strong>: She swoops down and flies through a maze of
rusting pipes and cables which look like the ramnants of an ancient
power station. Then she steers her bird through a hidden opening in the
rotting floor, and enters a magnificent secret hideaway cut deep into
the rock.</p>
<p><strong>inside taarna’s hideaway</strong>: Landing her bird on a
circular slab of gleaming marble, TAARNA dismounts and walks over to a
shimmering pool. Here she disrobes, and picking up a small gold pitcher,
she pours an ancient oil over herself. It shines and sparkles as it
touches her skin. Then she steps into the water, where her body seems to
sparkle even brighter.</p>
<p>****: To defend - this is the Pact. but when life loses its value,
and it taken for nought, then the Pact is … to avenge!!</p>
<p><strong>the sky</strong>: From over our heads, TAARNA comes soaring
past, her armour gleaming in the rays of the setting sun. Below her, she
sees a metallic holiday-town filled with barbarian soldiers. Drunken
blue men fight in the streets, strange animals run around loose, and
dead or drunken bodies lie in the gutters.</p>
<p><strong>inside the barroom</strong>: Barbarian honky-tonk music fills
the crowded room, as various barbarian soldiers sit drinking and
fondling the bar-girls who are dressed in cheap, flashy metal
outfits.</p>
<p><strong>the barroom door</strong>: TAARNA walks in through the
swinging silver and plexiglass doors, past the three soldiers kicking
their victim. She sits down at the bar.</p>
<p><strong>barbarian #1</strong>: Hey, look. A new one. Where you from,
baby?</p>
<p><strong>barbarian #2</strong>: Doesn’t talk much, does she ?</p>
<p><strong>barbarian #3</strong>: She doesn’t have to talk for what I
want to do with her.</p>
<p><strong>taarna’s hand</strong>: It slowly moves down to her sword,
and unclips the safety strap.</p>
<p><strong>barbarian #3</strong>: C’mon baby, let’s see what’s under
there.</p>
<p><strong>barbarian #1</strong>: Yeah, let’s have a look.</p>
<p><strong>barbarian #2</strong>: Heey, she’s tough.</p>
<p><strong>barbarian #3</strong>: Maybe she wants to fight?</p>
<p><strong>barbarian #1</strong>: … or maybe she wants to take us all
on?</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Beyond the oasis.</p>
<p><strong>the bartender</strong>: His eyes start to turn green. The
camera gets closer and closer to his glowing eyes, until the green glow
turns into the image of a ball, lying in the ground, in AUSTIN’S
holograph.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: AUSTIN is crouched over the machine turning
several knobs, trying to make the ball move. Nothing happens.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Hmmm … must be jammed.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Where’d it go?</p>
<p><strong>the hands</strong>: As the hands cradle the green ball, the
camera pulls back to reveal a skinny, unco-ordinated boy wearing thick
eyeglasses, carrying the sphere across his backyard. This is DAN.</p>
<p>****: It all started when I found the green meteorite. I read in
Farraday’s “Life of the Planets” that smaller ones like this are
supposed to burn up when they enter the atmosphere, but for some reason
this one didn’t …</p>
<p><strong>t.v. antenna on roof - stormy night</strong>: As the
narration continues, we follow two red wires down from the T.V. antenna,
along the roof, and into DAN’S attic window. The wires run through a
bucket of water and are hooked up to some electronic parts on DAN’S
desk.</p>
<p>****: … so I brought it up to my room, stuck it in my rock collection
and forgot about it. I was experimenting with natural electricity …</p>
<p>****: … and with the storm warnings up, I figured maybe tonight I’d
hit the jackpot. All I needed was a little juice.</p>
<p><strong>the storm</strong>: Crackling from the sky, a bolt of
lightning strikes the television antenna and surges along the wires into
the attic.</p>
<p><strong>dan’s attic room</strong>: The lightning flashes into DAN’S
apparatus, lighting it up brightly.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: It works!</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Oh Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>the transformation</strong>: We float in darkness for a
moment as black shapeless images zoom past.</p>
<p>****: I felt like I was nothing - just atoms floating in the darkness
…</p>
<p>****: Then, a body started to re-form around me. Only it wasn’t my
body - this one had muscles.</p>
<p>****: It was a great body, but I wasn’t too crazy about the face.</p>
<p><strong>den</strong>: Hmmm … no hair.</p>
<p><strong>the neverwhere pyramid</strong>: DEN, strong, masculine and
hairless, materializes cradled in the hand of a huge stone idol. He is
naked and unconscious Above him, the glowing green ball is held in the
idol’s other hand.</p>
<p><strong>priests</strong>: Uluhtec, Ulutec …</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: By the powers of the glowing Loc-Nar placed
in your idol’s hand, I demand you come forth, Uluhtec!</p>
<p><strong>the idol’s hands</strong>: The green ball, , glows brightly
as DEN opens his eyes, looks down and notices his enormous genitals.</p>
<p><strong>den</strong>: Hmmm … big!</p>
<p>****: There was no way I was gonna walk around this place with my
dork hangin’ out!</p>
<p>****: Wow! This looked like something right out of the Ten
Commandments.</p>
<p><strong>edge of raging pool</strong>: The QUEEN is kneeling before
the seething water.</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: Grant me your strength in return for a living
mortal sacrifice! It has been ordained. Come forth Uluhtec! I demand
it!</p>
<p><strong>the idol’s water</strong>: Seeing the girl struggle in the
water, DEN’S eyes grow wide.</p>
<p>****: What’d they do that for?</p>
<p><strong>under water</strong>: Reaching her, DEN grabs the girl’s
bound ankles, hooks them over his head and drags her through a decayed
hole in the underwater wall. Inside a stone tunnel, they are swept along
by the current.</p>
<p>****: Normally, I’d be dead by now. I kept thinking I was going to
run out of air, but my new body worked great. I just hoped her body was
working as good as mine.</p>
<p><strong>ext. field of lilies - day</strong>: DEN and the girl are
washed out into a pond at the center of a beautiful field of lilies. He
pulls her out of the water, unconscious. As he unties her, she begins to
stir.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p>****: She had the most beautiful eyes. I wanted to make some
conversation but I found my new self asking the same old stupid
questions.</p>
<p><strong>den</strong>: Are you from around here?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Well, you may not believe this, but I’m from
another world - from a place called Earth.</p>
<p><strong>den</strong>: Earth? I too am from Earth. How did you get
here?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: My name is Katherine Wells, and I’m from the
British colony of Gibraltar. Time makes no diff- erence here, but there
it was the summer of 1892. It was evening - I’d gone for a walk on the
cliffs when suddenly a sphere fell from the sky. Following its glow, I
came to a shining gate made out of light. Unable to resist, I stepped
through it and awoke in this world. There I was thin and weakly, fit
only to stay indoors. But here, somehow I am stronger, more alive, …
more fully a woman.</p>
<p>****: You’re not kidding.</p>
<p><strong>den</strong>: I, too seem better equipped on this world. My
arms are more powerful. Even my fingers seem to hold great strength.</p>
<p><strong>katherine</strong>: You saved my life. I have no reward to
give you, but if any part of me pleases your senses - I would give it
willingly.</p>
<p>****: Wow! This was great! There was no way I’d get a chick like this
back on Earth. I mean, look at her!!</p>
<p>****: There was only one problem …</p>
<p><strong>katherine.</strong>: The camera then pulls back to reveal the
entwined couple, completely surrounded by a horde of grim, bestial
warriors.</p>
<p>****: I don’t know who these jerks were, but they sure picked a bad
time to show up …</p>
<p><strong>ard’s throne room</strong>: The beast-Captain keeps his
machine gun trained on DEN as the soldiers lead him into the cavernous
room.</p>
<p>****: They split us up and took me to this weird castle-type place. I
wanted to find out where they’d taken Katherine, but none of these guys
seemed to speak English.</p>
<p><strong>ard</strong>: They tell me you are Den of Earth, the one who
dared to steal the female sacrifice from the Queen.</p>
<p>****: This guy was a shrimp so I figured I’d play it tough.</p>
<p><strong>den</strong>: Where is the girl?</p>
<p><strong>ard</strong>: I am Ard - supreme leader of the revolution and
the next ruler of the world.</p>
<p><strong>den</strong>: The girl!!</p>
<p><strong>ard</strong>: Well, aren’t we fierce? If you are truly as
tough as you seem, then you will serve me well. But first, a test.
Guards! Castrate him!</p>
<p>****: Uh oh.</p>
<p>****: Boy! I was pretty good at this stuff.</p>
<p><strong>ard</strong>: Excellent. You are worthy to serve me.</p>
<p><strong>den</strong>: Give me the girl or die.</p>
<p><strong>ard</strong>: Well, if I have a choice, I’ll take death.</p>
<p><strong>den</strong>: So be it.</p>
<p><strong>ard</strong>: Ha ha ha! You’ll have to do better than
that.</p>
<p>****: I could see why they made this guy their leader.</p>
<p><strong>ard</strong>: … but if you’re really interested in the girl;
I’ve had her encased in glass.</p>
<p><strong>den</strong>: She’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>ard</strong>: Actually no. She’s sleeping, but only I can
awaken her.</p>
<p><strong>den</strong>: What do you want of me?</p>
<p><strong>ard</strong>: I want you to steal the sacred Loc-Nar.</p>
<p><strong>den</strong>: What is this Loc-Nar?</p>
<p><strong>ard</strong>: The Queen’s glowing sphere, you fool. The
sacrifice to Uluhtec can only be performed by the possessor of the
sacret Loc-Nar. Norl!</p>
<p><strong>ard</strong>: This is Norl, my bravest warrior. You will go
with him to the Queen’s castle and steal the Loc-Nar. Then I will give
you the girl.</p>
<p><strong>den</strong>: And if I refuse?</p>
<p><strong>ard</strong>: If you refuse, you die, she dies, everybody
dies.</p>
<p>****: Sounded reasonable to me.</p>
<p><strong>river banks near the queen’s castle</strong>: In the
moonlight, DEN and NORL lead a squad of beast-warriors, armed with
automatic weapons, along the river towards the Queen’s castle.</p>
<p><strong>norl</strong>: Ssh. Guard post ahead. We must go
underground.</p>
<p>****: This guy Norl seemed to know what he was doing. And, for a
gorilla, his English wasn’t half bad.</p>
<p><strong>underground tunnel</strong>: The group, carrying torches,
moves along the dark tunnel. They pass a bubble-window with shark-faced
eels swimming on the other side.</p>
<p><strong>norl</strong>: We’re underneath the castle moat.</p>
<p><strong>den</strong>: What are they saying?</p>
<p><strong>norl</strong>: They talk of the savage beast who prowls these
catacombs with a fierce hunger and sharp teeth … six inches long.</p>
<p><strong>norl</strong>: Sorry … … sixteen inches long.</p>
<p><strong>doorway in catacombs</strong>: DEN, NORL, and the remaining
warriors arrive at a door in the rock wall.</p>
<p><strong>norl</strong>: Now we separate. You and Korg take this door
into the Queen’s quarters. The rest of us will move through the walls
and enter her chamber from the other side. Whoever gets the Loc-Nar
first will return it to Ard. Good luck, Den.</p>
<p><strong>dark room</strong>: DEN and KORG silently enter. Across the
dark room, the glow of the green ball casts a pale light.</p>
<p><strong>korg</strong>: Loc-Nar.</p>
<p>****: Wow! It was just like the ball I dug up in my back yard.</p>
<p>****: As I saw the Loc-Nar’s glow I had this real funny feeling. All
by themselves, my hands reached forward to touch it. But the Loc-Nar
moved out of the way. Instead, my hands felt something else - warm
flesh. Then the lights came on.</p>
<p>****: Talk about embarassing!</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: Kill them.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Can I slit his throat, your Majesty?</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: Yes, slit his throat.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Thank you, your Majesty.</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: Stop! I have, ah, something better in
mind.</p>
<p><strong>guard #1</strong>: Jeez, not again.</p>
<p><strong>guard #2</strong>: This always happens.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Look, she’s the Queen. She can do whatever
she wants.</p>
<p><strong>guard #2</strong>: Yeah, sure.</p>
<p><strong>guard #1</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>the queen’s boudoir</strong>: The QUEEN stands before DEN,
hands on her hips and a funny look in her eye.</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: If you please me, I may let you live.</p>
<p>****: Uh oh.</p>
<p><strong>den</strong>: What must I do?</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: Satisfy my appetites.</p>
<p>****: Wow! Eighteen years of nuthin’ and now, twice in one day. What
a place!</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: Come with me.</p>
<p><strong>den</strong>: Mmmm.</p>
<p><strong>the queen’s bed</strong>: DEN and the QUEEN are lying
undressed on the enormous bed. The QUEEN has a very contented look on
her face. DEN looks exhausted. As the Neverwhere moon rises outside the
chamber window, the QUEEN slowly runs her hand over DEN’S bulging
muscles.</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: The rising moon climaxes our love, Den. Is is
a sign, a new beginning.</p>
<p><strong>den</strong>: Yes, a sign.</p>
<p>****: I had no idea what she was talking about.</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: Neverwhere is a troubled land, but together
we could calm it. We could rule side by side. Your strength has brought
great peace to my restless body. It could bring great peace to all the
troubled people of this land.</p>
<p>****: I knew I was good, but I didn’t know I was that good.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Your Majesty! The Loc-Nar is missing -
stolen!</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: Fiend! You make love to me while your
accomplices steal the magic sphere! Guards! Take him!</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: Hold him still! I will kill him myself!</p>
<p>****: Boy, was she pissed off!</p>
<p><strong>the castle wall</strong>: DEN falls down, down into the
swirling waters of the castle moat.</p>
<p><strong>the queen</strong>: She is livid.</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: Prepare the flying lizards. I want his
head!</p>
<p><strong>outside the castle</strong>: Pulling himself out of the moat,
DEN knocks a guard off his leopard/horse and rides off.</p>
<p><strong>the neverwhere pyramid</strong>: ARD is kneeling at the edge
of the sacrificial pool. Beside him sits a long glass case wrapped in
chains. Through the chains we see KATHERINE trapped inside - fully
conscious and terrified. Ard’s bestial warriors stand all around
carrying torches and spears.</p>
<p><strong>ard</strong>: By the power of the magic Loc-Nar placed in
your idol’s hands, I command you - come forth Uluhtec!</p>
<p><strong>the neverwhere desert</strong>: DEN is racing across the
barren desert on his leopard/horse. Visible in the distance is the
outline of the huge, truncated pyramid where he first saved
KATHERINE.</p>
<p><strong>den</strong>: Katherine!</p>
<p><strong>another part of the neverwhere desert</strong>: The QUEEN,
riding a flying lizard, leads her army in pursuit of DEN.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: There he is, your Majesty!</p>
<p><strong>queen’s p.o.v.</strong>: Up ahead, silhouetted in the
moonlight, she sees DEN, riding up the steps of the pyramid. The camera
pans to the green glow atop the torch-lit pyramid.</p>
<p>****: The Loc-Nar!</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: Faster! To the pyramid!</p>
<p><strong>the neverwhere pyramid</strong>: ARD is incanting to the
raging water while two hooded monks stand beside him, holding the
struggling KATHERINE out over the pool.</p>
<p><strong>ard</strong>: Here is your sacrifice, Uluhtec. Now, give me
your power! Throw her in.</p>
<p><strong>den</strong>: Katherine!</p>
<p><strong>katherine</strong>: Den!</p>
<p><strong>ard</strong>: No! You’ll ruin everything!</p>
<p><strong>ard</strong>: Kill them! Kill them both!</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: The Loc-Nar is mine!</p>
<p><strong>ard</strong>: Stupid bitch! Get away from me!</p>
<p><strong>den</strong>: Holding KATHERINE in one arm, DEN smashes a
nearby soldier and grabs the beast’s spear. With the battle raging all
around him, DEN looks up at the sky.</p>
<p><strong>the sky</strong>: Lightning crackles, illuminating the night
with electricity.</p>
<p><strong>den</strong>: DEN reaches down, picks up the long chain that
was wrapped around the glass case and attaches one end to his spear. He
kicks the other end into the raging water, then heaves the spear with
all his might into the head of the stone idol.</p>
<p><strong>katherine</strong>: Where did they go?</p>
<p><strong>den</strong>: They are gone. That is all that matters.</p>
<p>****: They probably went back to Earth. Boy, will Mom be
surprised.</p>
<p><strong>katherine</strong>: The Loc-Nar … you could have the power of
Uluhtec. You could be ruler over all these people.</p>
<p><strong>den</strong>: Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>den’s flying lizard</strong>: KATHERINE clings to DEN as they
fly.</p>
<p><strong>katherine</strong>: Oh, but Den, with the Loc-Nar you could
have returned to Earth.</p>
<p><strong>den</strong>: I like it better here.</p>
<p>****: On Earth, I’m nobody. But here, I am DEN.</p>
<p><strong>the neverwhere pyramid</strong>: The camera pans down the
stone statue to the glowing sphere, which lies abandoned on the ground.
The soldiers are gone. As we watch, time begins to accelerate and the
Neverwhere Pyramid ages and crumbles all around the green ball. The
earth heaves and shifts, and dense vegetarian grows up through the
cracks in the ground.</p>
<p><strong>people</strong>: The people appears to be a band of
aboriginal workmen, carrying futuristic laser-shovels over their
shoulders. They are led by a goateed archaeologist with an elaborate
metal detector. As he walks, his detector starts bleeping. He points to
a spot on the ground, and the natives start digging with their laser-
shovels.</p>
<p><strong>worker</strong>: Kuma! Kuma! Kuma!</p>
<p><strong>new york - aerial shot - day</strong>: The camera comes down
from high above the city. The general shape and outline of New York
looks familiar, but as we get closer we sense that something is
different. Fires are burning in various locations below us, and
intermittent gunshots become audible as the narration begins.</p>
<p>****: Yeah, New York, big deal. Scum-centre of the world.</p>
<p>****: … and now they’re talking about letting in low-lifes from other
planets, too.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: You free?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yeah. Get in.</p>
<p>****: My name’s Harry Canyon. I drive a cab.</p>
<p><strong>outside cab</strong>: The young man climbs into the back seat
and closes the door. Harry’s yellow Checker cab pulls out into traffic.
The vehicle looks pretty normal except for some vaguely futuristic
chrome panels cut into the sides, and thicker, deeper bumpers.</p>
<p><strong>inside cab</strong>: Harry slides open the plexiglass shields
separating him from his passenger.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Where to, pal?</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: The U.N. Building.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: The U.N. Building. What a joke. Used to be a
nice place until they turned it into low rent housing. Now it’s a dump.
I wouldn’t live there if you paid me.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Okay sucker, hand over your cash,
now!</p>
<p>****: This city is really going to the dogs.</p>
<p>****: Stupid asshole. Nobody touches me unless I want ’em to.</p>
<p><strong>ext. metropolitian museum - night</strong>: The camera is
close-up on the illustrated banner over the main entrance. The banner
reads; “Treasures of the Loc-Nar - Coming July 8th”.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Father!</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Run!</p>
<p><strong>rudnick</strong>: He’s dead. Get the girl!</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Help me, please!!</p>
<p>****: Normally my rule is “Don’t get involved”, but something about
this dame got to me.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: The Loc-Nar … they wanted it … but my father
wouldn’t tell them … now I’m the only one …</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Relax sister. There’s a cop station up here.
You can …</p>
<p>****: Just what I needed … guess I’m a sucker for a pretty face.</p>
<p><strong>police station</strong>: The police station is an all-metal
building with no windows. A plaque on thr front reads “N.Y. POLICE -
52nd DIVISION”.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Police. Whaddya want?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I wanna report a murder.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: So what else is new?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You gonna let me in or what?</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: Okay, this guy’s clean - next.</p>
<p><strong>desk sergeant</strong>: Before you go any further pal, I
gotta tell you, it’s cash up front. A thousand bucks a day for a full
investigation. Another thousand if the assailant is caught. Got it?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yeah thanks …</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: … for nuthin’!</p>
<p><strong>desk sergeant</strong>: You think you can do better? Join one
of the vigilante groups. There’s a list of ’em outside.</p>
<p><strong>ext. police station</strong>: HARRY, carrying the GIRL, comes
out of the police station, as a patrol car screeches to a halt in front
of him. Two cops emerge, dragging a green alien with four arms.</p>
<p><strong>green alien</strong>: I tell you I’m an American citizen. I
just lost my papers.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Goddamn illegal aliens.</p>
<p>****: So here I was, stuck with this beautiful girl. I knew she was
gonna be nuthin’ but trouble …</p>
<p>****: … but I didn’t feel right just leaving her for the sickos. I
dunno, maybe I’m gettin’ sentimental or something …</p>
<p><strong>int. harry’s apartment</strong>: This futuristic bachelor pad
is constructed entirely of brightly coloured molden plastic. Bowling
trophies sit on a shelf underneath a neon “Buweiser” clock. The place is
a mess.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Where am I?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: My place …</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: They’d have killed me if it wasn’t for
you.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What’d they want to snuff you for?</p>
