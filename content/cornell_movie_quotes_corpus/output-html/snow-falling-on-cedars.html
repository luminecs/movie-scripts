<h1 id="snow-falling-on-cedars">snow-falling-on-cedars</h1>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: It was the first murder trial on the island
in thirty-one years.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Our only newspaper was the San Piedro
Review, a four-page weekly that I operated alone.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: What, I wondered, could the Seattle boys
know of the hearts of these people…</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Neighbors, sitting in judgement. On their
neighbor.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Kabuo Miaymoto sat with the rigid grace of
a Samurai warrior. As if detached from his own trial.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Did he know how dangerous his demeanor
could be? With this jury.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Hatsue Miyamoto had been without her
husband for 77 days.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: He was in jail. When his baby son learned
to walk.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Earlier, I noticed her in the corridor.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: Go away, Ishmael.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Please don’t be like th…</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: …four inch gash, skull crushed, and your
thought was, what…?</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: That he…fell? Hit his head on the gunnel
going over?</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: Well, Carl was six-four, went 235. He was a
grizzly bear and an able seaman…</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: For him to just…go over. Crush his skull like
that on the way in…</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: He was a mountain, all right. Anchored the
line for us little fellers.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Chambers. Y’see the geese?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Picture’d be nice. In your pa’s paper.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Lucky I got the camera in my helmet.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Careful, Chambers. That was almost a joke.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: And you weren’t there, when the coroner
examined the wound.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: Nossir. I’d gone to tell the wid… to tell
Mrs. Heine.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: Hey there, men. Is your mother home
a-tall?</p>
<p><strong>susan marie</strong>: Sheriff Moran, hullo.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: You go on and play, now.</p>
<p><strong>susan marie</strong>: What can I do for you, Sheriff, Carl’s
not home y…</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: That’s…</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: It’s why I’m here. I’m afraid I have
some…very bad news to tell you, the…worst…kind of news.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: Carl died last night. In a fishing accident.
In White Sand Bay.</p>
<p><strong>susan marie</strong>: No, Carl’s fine, h…</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: We found him, Mrs. Heine. Tangled in his
net.</p>
<p><strong>susan marie</strong>: I told him this could happen.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: So, no…immediate suspicion, no…general talk
of enmity between the two.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: These are fishermen, Alvin. They don’t talk
at all to each other and less to me. Specially gossip.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: A gill-netter works through black nights
with only himself to talk to. And learns to be silent. They were lonely
men and products of geography.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: …men who, on occasion, realized that they
wished to speak, but couldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: Figure you’da heard by now.</p>
<p><strong>gjovaag</strong>: You go fishing, it happens.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: I did. Boy.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Three kids. What’s she going to do?</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Excuse me, Gjovaag.</p>
<p><strong>gjovaag</strong>: I don’t need to excuse nothin’. Fuck you
anyhow, Chambers.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Like the Sheriff, I did not work the sea,
and could never merit trust. Or respect.</p>
<p><strong>marty johansson</strong>: Sheriff’s been askin’ which boats
followed Carl out last night…</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: So who talked to him? Out there.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: All right, look, if you see these boys…</p>
<p><strong>gjovaag</strong>: Never saw you so hard-ass, Art. Ain’t this
just an accident?</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: Course it is, but a man’s dead, William. I
got to write my report.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: I’m not gonna see some article about an
investigation, am I?</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: No, I wanna be off the damn record, that’s
what I want.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: I mean, if there is a killer, why would you
want him all alerted?</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Let’s say…someday I need some cooperation
from you on this thing. Do I get it?</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: No sign of a struggle, you say.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: Well, the coffee cup was layin’ right in the
middle of the floor, like I said. And with a fella so neat as Carl, that
did seem peculiar.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: As peculiar as a struggle between a 235 pound
man, and an assailant strong enough to subdue him…that leaves only a
single overturned cup in its wake?</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: Objection, asking the witness to
speculate.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: My gosh, Alvin, was I supposed to object every
time you did that?</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: If I did that Your Honor, I’d be dead.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Any more homely loveable tricks, and you’ll
be worse than that. Proceed, gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: There’s an objection, Your H…</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: And it’s overruled, answer the question. If
you can recall it.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: Maybe the assailant straightened the cabin.
And forgot the cup.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Right. In the middle. Of the floor.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: I think you testified all the lights were on.
Cabin, mast, net lights, picking lights…</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: Yessir, there’d been real heavy fog.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: And yet you started the engine right up. With
all those lights drawing all night, the batteries had that much charge.
Did that strike you odd?</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: Didn’t think about it at the time. So no, it
didn’t strike me odd.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Does it now?</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: A little. Yes. You have to wonder.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: You have to wonder.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: You found three batteries, you say. A D-6 and
D-8 in the well. And a spare D-8 on the cabin floor. Correct?</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: It is.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Now I did some measuring down at the
chandlery. A D-6 is one inch wider than a D-8. It would be too large for
the deceased’s well.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: He’s done some on-the-spot refit- ting. You
could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the D-6.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: But he had a spare D-6, you said. Right there.
Why not use that?</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: It was dead. We had it tested. Maybe the D-6
was the spare and he had to use it.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Maybe he carried a spare that was too large to
fit. So he’d have to bang out the flange to squeeze it in?</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Sheriff, how many batteries and what size did
you find on defendant’s boat?</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: Two D-6’s. That’s the kind his well was
fitted for.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: No spare.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: So the defendant went out fishing for the
night with no spare battery, hmmn?</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: Apparently.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: I’m curious. The D-6 that was refitted into
the deceased’s well. Was it exactly the same brand and model as
defendant’s?</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: I believe so.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Now you’ve testified that the deceased was a
heavy man, and hard to bring out of the net.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Is it possible his head struck the transom, or
the stern gunnel, or the net roller, as you were bringing him in?</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: You don’t. Think so.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: He was heavy, but we were real careful. But I
don’t remember him hitting anything, anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: You don’t. Remember.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Operating this winch you’d rarely operated
before, doing this awkward job of bringing in a drowned man of 235
pounds…is it possible. Possible that he struck his head after death.
Possible?</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: Possible. But not darn likely.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: …so when the sheriff returned, you showed him
the injury to the deceased’s head.</p>
<p><strong>whaley</strong>: He said, ‘Could it be somebody hit him?’ And
I said, ‘You want to play Sherlock Holmes, here?’</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: Did you say more?</p>
<p><strong>whaley</strong>: I said that if I was playing Sherlock
Holmes…I’d maybe look for a… Japanese person. With a bloody gun- butt. A
right-handed fella, to be precise.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: And why. Is that?</p>
<p><strong>whaley</strong>: Well, I was a doctor in the Jap theater, in
the war. I saw those kendo wounds, many times. Looked exactly like this
one.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: Could you tell me what ‘kendo’ is?</p>
<p><strong>whaley</strong>: Japanese stick-fighting. They’re trained as
kids, y’know. To kill with sticks.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: No further questions.</p>
<p><strong>zenhichi</strong>: Hips, stomach, cut. Stomach muscles
tighten as stroke advances…</p>
<p><strong>zenhichi</strong>: Elbow soft, or there is no follow-
through. You cut your bokken off from the power of your body, unl…</p>
<p><strong>zenhichi</strong>: Hips sink more. Less weight on the heels,
so tha…</p>
<p><strong>zenhichi</strong>: Elbow soft. A little better.</p>
<p><strong>zenhichi</strong>: You can be good with the bokken. If you
begin to concentrate.</p>
<p><strong>zenhichi</strong>: You must choose now, Kabuo. At eight
years. If you want this.</p>
<p><strong>zenhichi</strong>: Then speak quietly. So you may be
heard.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: So this…foam you found in the lungs. How does
it get there?</p>
<p><strong>whaley</strong>: As I testified. It occurs when water, mucus
and air are mixed by respiration. I believe I said that.</p>
<p><strong>whaley</strong>: Of course not. The foam means that he went
in breathing.</p>
<p><strong>whaley</strong>: That’s why the autopsy report identifies
drowning as the cause of death.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Meaning that he wasn’t murdered first, say on
the deck of the boat, and then thrown overboard.</p>
<p><strong>whaley</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Your report says death by drowning, which
means he went into the water alive and breathing. And the report is
accurate…?</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Of course, it is. Now as to the head injury.
You say made by an object narrow and flat. That is your inference,
correct?</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: In your motorcycle example. Those injuries are
produced by the head being propelled against an object. Rather than the
reverse, yes?</p>
<p><strong>whaley</strong>: Obviously.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Can you tell whether an object moved against
the head, or the other way around? Or would both look the same.</p>
<p><strong>whaley</strong>: The same.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: So if his head struck something narrow and
flat, the gunnel of a boat, a net roller, a fairlead, could that
have…</p>
<p><strong>whaley</strong>: If the head was moving fast enough, but I
don’t see how it could be.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Is it possible?</p>
<p><strong>whaley</strong>: Sure, anything’s poss…</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Is it fair to say that you do not know for
certain which it was.</p>
<p><strong>whaley</strong>: I already said that, b…</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: And that you can’t say for certain whether the
head injury was sustained before or after death?</p>
<p><strong>whaley</strong>: For certain, no.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: But you are certain that he died by
drowning.</p>
<p><strong>whaley</strong>: For the third time, yes.</p>
<p><strong>whaley</strong>: Can I say something, here?</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Yes, you can tell me about the minor cut you
found on the deceased’s right hand. The report says ‘recent origin’. How
recent? As much as 24 hours before death?</p>
<p><strong>whaley</strong>: Absolutely not. Probably one or two hours.
Four at the most.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Are you absol…</p>
<p><strong>whaley</strong>: Yes, I’m sure.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Thank you, Horace. No more questions.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: We’ll take our luncheon recess. Reconvene
at…2 o’clock sharp.</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: How are the kids?</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: They need their father.</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: Well. Just a few more days.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: I look terrible. Don’t sit so straight like
Tojo’s soldier. The jury will be afraid of you.</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: Okay, I’ll hide under the table from now on.
That make you happy?</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: I’m not going until you smile.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: They’ll hear everything.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: Ishmael. See the yellow one?</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: Have you ever done this?</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: Never. You’re my only.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: …so right.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Course, we grew up together.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Her mom had this Mrs. Shigemura come on
Wednesdays. Teach her how to be Japanese.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Dances, calligraphy. Doing her hair. How to
sit without moving…</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: She would tell me stories of this woman and
her lessons. As if complaining, or at least ex- plaining her world…</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: But I always fantasized. The lessons were
for me.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. shigemura</strong>: No. You must never look at a man
directly. This is part of grace.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: I don’t think the boys on this island. Are
impressed. By grace.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. shigemura</strong>: Hakujin know nothing of life,
Hatsue.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. shigemura</strong>: This is why they fear death. Because
life here is separate from Being.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. shigemura</strong>: It is why they have no soul.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. shigemura</strong>: Life embraces death, includes it.
This truth brings tranquility. You must see yourself…</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: …as a leaf. On a great tree.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. shigemura</strong>: The pin. Could be better placed.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: My lessons came from my father. They were
different. Or seemed so, at the time.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: He operated the Review alone, with an
integrity and passion for principle that made him a figure of respect.
If slightly larger than life.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: He never spoke of wanting me to succeed
him. And, in truth, it was the last job on earth I thought I’d ever
want.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: When I was five, he casually mentioned that
if his sleeve got caught in the press, he’d be instantly popped open
like a child’s balloon, and splattered across the walls.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Even his bones would disappear, to be
discovered later on the floor, as strips of white confetti.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Which, of course, made me certain that life
would have no meaning until I could run that teakettle.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: He was, for better or worse, the only God
in my life. I guess it’s our nature to resent those we know we can never
measure up to…</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: …which keeps us from accepting the warmth.
The way we should.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Every summer, after harvest, the Strawberry
Festival was Dad’s favor- ite story to cover. Good news was his
preference. Making him an oddity among journalists.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Highlight was crowning the Strawberry
Princess. Always a Japanese girl, sort of an unwitting virgin sacrifice
to the concept of racial harmony.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Senior Year. It was Hatsue.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: She winked at me. In public. Which was
unusual.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: I had kissed her once, when we were ten.
Looking at fish through a glass-bottomed box. It was just an impulse,
and no big deal.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: He’s still got a good grip. We need to dig
more.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: At school, she kept mostly to the Japanese
kids, and sort of ignored me. As if all of our times alone together…in
the hollow cedar, everywhere…were a secret.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: I told myself that was good. That it made
our friendship special. And didn’t mean she was ashamed of it.
Necessarily.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: Easy. Slow is best.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: I thought about her. Sometimes, all the
time. I knew I was unhappy. But I knew if I told her…</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: It might be a mistake. I could never
correct.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Do you know what I mean, Hatsue? I’ve
always liked you.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: I knew in my heart that we would love each
other forever.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: The way she kissed me. She knew it,
too.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: She avoided me for a week.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: So this way, I could see her
without…bothering anyone.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: I was certain everything would work
out.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: And frightened.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: By two weeks, I knew I had made the
defining mistake of my life.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: I’d ruined everything.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: You followed me, huh?</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Sorry. It sort of…happened, I just…I
followed you. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: I’m all wet.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: I’m sorry I kissed you on the beach.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Let’s just forget about it. Forget it
happened.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: Don’t be sorry. I’m not sorry about it.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Me neither.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: Do you think this is wrong?</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: The best part was that there was a ‘this’.
To debate the wrongness of.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Your friends would. Your dad would kill me
with a machete.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: We’re Japanese, not Mexican, Ishmael. He’ll
slice you up with a ceremonial sword.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: My mom. Would be the problem.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Why? We’re only talking.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: I can’t hear you.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: We kissed for half an hour, that first
time. And I knew there would never be another day like it.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: No matter how long I lived.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: …you were acquainted with the defendant and
his family.</p>
<p><strong>etta</strong>: Him and his folks and two brothers and two
sisters worked our land. Lived in a picker’s cabin at first.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: So the defendant knew the deceased, your son,
even then.</p>
<p><strong>etta</strong>: They fished t’gether. Went to school. Carl
Junior treated him like a white person. Like any friend.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: But the dispute began. With the father,
yes?</p>
<p><strong>etta</strong>: Don’t sell, Carl. You’ll regret it.</p>
<p><strong>carl sr.</strong>: Only seven acres, and the worst seven, at
that. They’re decent folks. They got five hunnerd to put down now.</p>
<p><strong>etta</strong>: Don’t go wavin’ new church clothes at me.
We’re not such paupers as sell to Japs, are we? For what, a pouch of
fancy pipe tobacco?</p>
<p><strong>carl sr.</strong>: They work hard, live clean, don’t spend
nothin’. Even kind to the Indjuns. People is people, comes down to
it.</p>
<p><strong>etta</strong>: You wear the pants, doncha? Go ahead, sell our
land to a Jap and see what comes of it.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: But back in ’34, Japanese-born could not own
land. So…?</p>
<p><strong>etta</strong>: Carl held it for ’em. Called it a lease. They
make payments every June and December…</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: Why? If they could never take title.</p>
<p><strong>etta</strong>: Their kids was born here. So when the oldest,
that one there, was twenty…last payment gets made, and he could own
it.</p>
<p><strong>etta</strong>: But they missed their last two payments. So
that was that.</p>
<p><strong>etta</strong>: March 1942, orders came down. Japs had eight
days before the Army was gonna cart ’em off.</p>
<p><strong>zenhichi</strong>: We must leave everything. If you like, you
can work our fields, sell berries, keep the money. Otherwise, they just
rot.</p>
<p><strong>etta</strong>: Japs are shrewd. Offer berries he can’t use.
Soften us up about those two payments still to come.</p>
<p><strong>zenhichi</strong>: Today, I have $120 toward next paym…</p>
<p><strong>carl sr.</strong>: Absolutely not, Zenhichi. I’m not gonna
take your savings at a time like this.</p>
<p><strong>zenhichi</strong>: Please, you take. Then, I send more from
where I’m going. If not enough, you still have seven acres strawber…</p>
<p><strong>etta</strong>: Thought you was givin’ us those.</p>
<p><strong>etta</strong>: Didn’t you come in here givin’ them away? Now
you want $130, after our labor and fertilizer. Is that what you come
here hopin’ on?</p>
<p><strong>etta</strong>: I spit on him, and he’s pretending it didn’t
happen that way. How could anyone trust people like that?</p>
<p><strong>etta</strong>: You want more coffee?</p>
<p><strong>zenhichi</strong>: No, thank you. Take money, please.</p>
<p><strong>carl sr.</strong>: Etta’s been rude to you, and I apologize
for that. You keep this money, and those payments will work out fine.
Somewhere down the road.</p>
<p><strong>carl jr.</strong>: Look at this!</p>
<p><strong>carl jr.</strong>: Kabuo loaned it to me. Til he gets
back.</p>
<p><strong>carl jr.</strong>: It’s great for sea-run cutthroat. The
ferrules are smooth, silk wrapped.</p>
<p><strong>etta</strong>: Take that back. And do it now.</p>
<p><strong>carl jr.</strong>: I told Kabuo I’d take ca…</p>
<p><strong>etta</strong>: Those Japs owe us. I don’t want nothin’
confusing that.</p>
<p><strong>etta</strong>: I said now, boy. Supper’s in forty
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>carl sr.</strong>: We ain’t right together.</p>
<p><strong>carl sr.</strong>: You and me. We just ain’t right.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: You said neither of the last two payments
were made. But your husband told defendant’s father that he could pay
them…what, ‘down the road’.</p>
<p><strong>etta</strong>: Road ended October 1944, when my husband
passed away.</p>
<p><strong>etta</strong>: I sold all the land to our neighbor, Ole
Jurgensen. Got a fair price, this time. And…</p>
<p><strong>etta</strong>: Sent all their equity back to those Japs down
in California. Which I didn’t have to do. Specially since my boy was out
in the Pacific, gettin’ shot at by Japs at the time.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: Now defendant’s father had also died by that
point. Where was the defendant? When you sent his family their
equity.</p>
<p><strong>etta</strong>: In the war. Europe, I believe. They could
hardly send him to the Pacific, could they?</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: And when he came home. Did he write you about
this? Or phone, perhaps.</p>
<p><strong>etta</strong>: Just showed up at my door, big as life and
twice as mean. Wanted to talk to my son.</p>
<p><strong>etta</strong>: He’s over the ocean, fighting the Japs.
They’re just about licked.</p>
<p><strong>etta</strong>: When Mr. Heine passed away, I couldn’t farm
the place myself, could I? You’re gonna have to talk to Ole abou…</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: I just did. He didn’t know we were one
payment away. You didn’t tell him Mr. Heine promised my fath…</p>
<p><strong>etta</strong>: I was s’posed to tell him there’s some illegal
contract muddling things up? You folks didn’t make your pay- ments. In
America, bank comes in and repossesses your land. I didn’t do anything
wrong.</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: Nothing illegal. Wrong is a different
mat…</p>
<p><strong>etta</strong>: Get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: You sold our land out from under us,
Mrs. Heine. You took advantage of the fact that we were gone. You…</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: What do you mean by ‘dirty looks’?</p>
<p><strong>etta</strong>: Well. Every time I see him in town or
somewhere, he’s starin’ at me with these narrow eyes. Givin’ me his mean
face.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: When your son came back from the war, what
did he say about all this?</p>
<p><strong>etta</strong>: That he’d keep an eye on Miyamoto. Watch out
for him.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: Did he see some danger from defen…</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Objection. Asking witness to speculate about
deceased’s state of mind.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: All right. What did your son say to that
effect?</p>
<p><strong>etta</strong>: He said he wished Kabuo would forget about his
seven acres, and stop lookin’ at us cross-eyed.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: Your witness.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Just three questions. The Miyamoto family
bought your seven acres for $4500?</p>
<p><strong>etta</strong>: Tried to. Defaulted on their payments.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Second question. What did Ole Jurgensen pay
you per acre?</p>
<p><strong>etta</strong>: A thousand.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: So that makes what would have been $4500 into
$7000, doesn’t it? If you sent the equity back, you had a profit of
$2500.</p>
<p><strong>etta</strong>: Is that your third question?</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: It is.</p>
<p><strong>etta</strong>: You done your math right.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: You, too. No further questions.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: Were those his exact words?</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: Robbed. He was angry.</p>
<p><strong>ole</strong>: Oh, yeh. He said someday he would get his land
back.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: Mr. Jurgensen. Did he offer to buy the seven
acres from you?</p>
<p><strong>ole</strong>: Oh, yeh. But this is nine year ago, I had my
healt, I wasn’t wantin’ to sell.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: And then your stroke came this summer. And
you put your property on the market, I believe you said September 7.
Which, remember, is eight days before Carl Heine died. And who comes
Spetember 7, wanting to buy?</p>
<p><strong>ole</strong>: Carl Heine came.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: But Carl was a fisherman. And successful at
it.</p>
<p><strong>ole</strong>: He said he didn’t want that life no more. He’d
been saving to buy a farm. He was sorry I got sick. But pretty excited
to get back his father’s place.</p>
<p><strong>ole</strong>: Liesel and me. Was happy for him.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: And later, that same day. Only eight days
before Carl Heine died. Did another prospective buyer appear?</p>
<p><strong>liesel</strong>: I’m sorry to tell you, we took his earnest
money, he shook Ole’s hand. Come November, he’ll sell his boat, and take
over the farm.</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: But your sign…</p>
<p><strong>ole</strong>: We din’t have no time to take it down. He just
come ten o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: It’s my fault. I should have come
earlier.</p>
<p><strong>ole</strong>: If you want t’buy them seven acres. Carl
Heine’s the only fella can sell ’em.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: I apologize for keeping you folks from your
families in a storm like this. I do hope you’ll be reasonably
comfortable in the hotel tonight. And one more thing…</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: This Court takes judicial notice of the fact
that tomorrow is the 13th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Which has no relationship to this trial.
Which is why I mention it.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: 10 o’clock tomorrow, folks. Stay warm.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Know where it is?</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: It’s in my other hand.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Your mother went to the bathroom. She said
I could show them a trick.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: Thank you for your help. Let’s go find
obaasan.</p>
<p><strong>abel</strong>: This is from Nels, I can’t see the harm. Don’t
tell Art, okay?</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: This here is Nels Gudmundsson, he’s your
attorney.</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: What makes you think I play?</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Your daddy played. I asked, down at the
Japanese Community Center. You smoke cigars?</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: I’m not sure. I better check down at the
Center.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: White or black?</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: You mean, do I like to take the offensive? Or
hang back and wait.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Nice. When two fellas understand each
other.</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: You must think I like losing.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: I think you like learning.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Me, too. That’s why I come.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Bet there’s a few things you could teach me.
Kendo, for one.</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: Sure. I could take a fishing gaff and split
your head open. Right above your left ear.</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: You wouldn’t even see it move.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: You’re wonderin’…how come I never ask. If you
did it.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Now, you’ve told me you killed four men. In
Germany. So I know you are the kind of man who can kill. When there’s a
reason.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: You feel guilty. That you took their lives.
That’s in your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Prosecutor thinks. What was your reason? To
kill Carl Heine.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Well, there is the land itself. Raise your
children where you were raised. Sleep with your wife at night, ‘stead of
bein’ alone on the sea.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: There’s fairness and honor. You were cheated
by that old bitch. Boy, she is something.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: And prejudice, like you say. Your people
locked in a concentration camp. You go off to fight for our country’s
freedom. Come back to this.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: But Mr. Hooks has missed the one reason. One
reason. You coulda done it.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: I read you Etta Heine’s deposition. So I could
watch your mind. Like I do when you move your rook, or when I move
mine.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: And you weren’t thinking about her. Or about
land. Or about you.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: No, someone cheats you, you can rise above
that. You’re a family man. You put them ahead of you, hmmn?</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Wasn’t you she dishonored.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Your father was a strong and tireless man.
Honest to a fault. Kind, and humble as well…</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Now this jury is gonna be lookin’ at the
evidence with one eye. And at you with the oth…</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: Mr. Gudmundsson, we know what that jury is
looking at.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Your father needs you. To return to your
family.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: So every time you think about showing that
jury strength. Or honor or composure. Or dignity.</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: I should show them an American?</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Show them an innocent man.</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: Shame you couldn’t play chess with my dad,
sir. He’d kick your ass.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: I gave her all of my soul to love. I knew
someday we would live in France. Italy. Somewhere. Far from the things
that upset her.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: I can just feel my spirits soar.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Well, I don’t do it for just anybody.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: There can’t be any wrong in this, Ha…</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: I lie to my parents every day. And every
night.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Well. Since I never told your folks, I
guess I’m lying to ’em, too. But you don’t hear me complaining about
it.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: I’m in awe. Of your strength.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: …not just Pearl, they’re attackin’ all over
the Pacific, the whole fleet’s destroyed. The FBI’s in Seattle right
now…</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: …arresting Jap traitors, the spies and
everything. There’ll be a blackout tonight, so keep your radios off. So
the Japs don’t pick up no signals. You get the message?</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Hey, Mr. Lamberson, over here!</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: I have a radio, too. Don’t you want to be
sure I got the message?</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Just checking.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: It was a special edition, an extra. My
father wrote, ‘These people are our neighbors, they have sent their sons
to the United States Army…’</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: ‘They are no more an enemy than our fellow
islanders of German or Italian descent.’</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: I guess courage never inspires the young.
Until the danger of it bites their butt.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: My father can’t get our money from the bank.
We have a few dol…</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: It’ll be over soon. I can get you
money.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: It’s not going to get better, okay?</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: They arrested Mr. Shirazaki, because his
farm is near a navy transmitter. And his family can’t leave their
house.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: It’s just Pearl Harbor. People are a little
crazy, right n…</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: Look at my face. It’s the face of the people
who did that. My father hardly speaks English. We’re in bad trouble, you
have to see that.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Maybe we can fix your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Don’t let this hurt us, okay? Whatever
happens.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: It won’t. You’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>fujiko</strong>: Everyone on the island has these things.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: You folks have been real polite, and we’ll be
outta your hair in just a second…</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: That’s very nice. From the old country, it
appears. Very high class.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: These are real nice things. They’ll take
special care of ’em.</p>
<p><strong>hisao</strong>: The flute is precious. The kimono, the music.
Must you take th…</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: …oh yeh, any old country stuff, we have to
take.</p>
<p><strong>fujiko</strong>: This is only my daughter’s scrapbook. For
her memories.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Strawberry Princess, huh? You musta been
flattered by that. Looks just like y…</p>
<p><strong>hisao</strong>: You must believe. This for tree stumps. For
clearing land.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Maybe. Maybe. But this is still bad,
y’see.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: It’s illegal contraband, you were s’posed to
turn this stuff in. We, uh…</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: We gotta arrest you. Have to take you to
Seattle.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Naw, you don’t need those. Mister
Eee-ma-da-san here is a class act, a real gentleman.</p>
<p><strong>fujiko</strong>: Please, reconsider. He has done no bad
th…</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Well, nobody knows that yet, do they? So,
best for an honest man to clear his name for godd and all.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Only a few questions in Seattle, okay? Few
questions, few answers, the whole thing is over.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Simple as that.</p>
<p><strong>fujiko</strong>: Why do I read you this distres- sing letter?
From your father. From this hakujin…work camp, it is called. In
Montana.</p>
<p><strong>fujiko</strong>: Because you need to know the darkness. In
the hearts of the hakuj…</p>
<p><strong>fujiko</strong>: The whites are enslaved by their egos,
Hatsue. Each believes his aloneness is everything. We seek union wi…</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: …the ones seeking union with the Greater
Life bombed Pearl Harbor. They are not humble. I am not part of them,
I’m part of here.</p>
<p><strong>fujiko</strong>: I see it in your eagerness to leave here.
And walk the woods. In the afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>fujiko</strong>: If you lose your true self, Hatsue. True
self…</p>
<p><strong>fujiko</strong>: There is no way back.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: See, you bring it on yourself. 23 ladies
honored by the PTA, you single out three names. And they’re all
Japanese. That isn’t journalism.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Because journalism. Is just the facts.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Which facts? You can’t print them all.
Journalism is balance. Finding the facts folks need to know.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Hence. The letters.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: ‘Seems like you’re favoring the Japs, Art.
Writin’ all about their patriotism and loyalty with nothin’ ‘bout the
treachery.’</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: ‘Your newspaper is an insult to all white
Americans. Please cancel my subscription and send refund.’</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: The calls are better. ‘Jap lovers get their
balls cut off and stuffed down their…’ Missed the rest. Hanging up will
do that.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: We lost the Price-Rite ads. And Lottie
Opsvig’s shop, and Larsen’s Lumberyard and the Anacortes Cafe. And 30
percent of our subscribers.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Integrity is expensive stuff, huh?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Valuable things. Sometimes are.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: But. I’ve got the answer.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Print four pages. Instead of eight.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: You’re like me. You’ve learned to be
devious.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: It’s not devious, it’s what we have to do.
You’re leaving tomorrow…</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: You write to my house, and put Kenny
Yamashita’s name on the return address. It’s no big deal.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: You smell like cedar.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: So do you. It’s your smell I’ll miss as much
as anything.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Let’s get married, okay?</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: I want to marry you. Is that okay?</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: When something that means your whole life.
Is the last time ever…</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: God should tell you. Or it’s not fair.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: No. No. It isn’t right.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: It felt right to me. It felt like getting
married.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: I’ll write you.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: On Monday, March 30, 1942, the United
States Army graciously transported the Imada women to the docks.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Lifelong neighbors came to watch. Curiosity
masked as kindness…</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: …with some exceptions.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: You think we’re far enough away now?</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: Mom, whatever this is, they don’t keep war
secrets this carefully.</p>
<p><strong>fujiko</strong>: Secrets are hard to keep.</p>
<p><strong>fujiko</strong>: This letter. Was opened. By mistake.</p>
<p><strong>fujiko</strong>: The neighborhood boy. Who taught you to
swim?</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: You shouldn’t have opened that. It was
mi…</p>
<p><strong>fujiko</strong>: How can I ever hope. For your
forgiveness.</p>
<p><strong>fujiko</strong>: I have written this letter to the boy’s
parents…</p>
<p><strong>fujiko</strong>: Attraction is no crime, certainly among
children. The dishonor lies in the concealment. From your families.</p>
<p><strong>fujiko</strong>: I know that you know this. I know you have
suffered. Even if the hakujin could not.</p>
<p><strong>fujiko</strong>: There will be no further letters. No contact
of any k…</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: One more letter. I will write it. You may
read it, and send it for me.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: I deceived more than you. I deceived this
sweet boy. And myself. It was never love.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: I will work hard. To earn your
forgiveness.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: I can never hope for his.</p>
<p><strong>sumiko</strong>: These boys are buildings us a mansion!</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: I’m Kabuo Miyamoto, Mrs. Imada.</p>
<p><strong>fujiko</strong>: We are in your debt, Miyamoto-san. How are
your parents, your family…?</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: My father is sick with the camp food. The
rest of us are fine. Don’t speak of dept, please, we just want to
help.</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: Hi, Hatsue, remember me?</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: I was a senior when you were a junior. But
I’ve seen you around.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: Nice to see you.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Her letter reached me on the North Island
of New Zealand. So I had a month to think it over…</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: I wrote her four times. ‘I hate you with
all my heart. I hate you, Hatsue, I’ll hate you always!’</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: I never sent the letters. I wanted to kill
as many Japs as possible.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Eric Bledsoe was bleeding to death. Thirty
yards away.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: I knew nothing could save him. Hell, I
didn’t have so much as a band-aid. I also knew I was a coward. For not
giving up my life to try.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: You pussies are the kinda chickenshits
deserve to have your balls chewed off real slow when this is over!</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Any man who won’t follow me over this wall
is a cornhole-fucker with a half-inch hard-on wh…</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: I wanted to live. And I didn’t know
why.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Some colonel came down the beach. Any man
who didn’t go over the wall at 2100 would be court-martialed, disgraced
and imprisoned…</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: The captain who followed said shot on
sight.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: My arm was dealt with by a pharmacist’s
mate, whose surgical career was four hours old.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: He used a handsaw.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: I dream of it, now and then. The way my
fingers curled. Against the wall.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: …fucking goddam Jap bitch!</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: It was all I could think of to say.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: There was nothing more to say. For a long
while.</p>
<p><strong>zenhichi</strong>: Your great-grandfather was a samurai, a
magnificent soldier.</p>
<p><strong>zenhichi</strong>: He killed himself. On the battlefield. At
Kumamoto.</p>
<p><strong>zenhichi</strong>: He went to battle with a sword. Against
rifles, mind you. Knowing what honor required.</p>
<p><strong>zenhichi</strong>: He was angry. To the point of being crazy,
yes. But he knew what honor. Required.</p>
<p><strong>zenhichi</strong>: Honor can require loyalty. Revenge.
Death.</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: These are safe, father. The hakujin will
never f…</p>
<p><strong>zenhichi</strong>: Only scale. In which our worth. Is
weighed.</p>
<p><strong>zenhichi</strong>: Every life ends. And if it ends
dishonored. It is as if…</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: Well, this one here comes off Miyamoto’s
boat. Matches all his others, worn equal and so on. But this one
here…</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: …comes off third cleat from the stern, port
side. And it’s brand new. Unlike the rest.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: And the next one…?</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: From Carl Heine’s boat. All his were like
this one, three-strand manila, new condition, braided in loops. Not
bowlined like Miyamoto’s.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: And the last…?</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: Found on Carl’s boat, too. Starboard side,
second cleat from the stern. But it doesn’t match Carl’s lines. It
matches Miyamoto’s. perfect.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: So if defendant had tied up to deceased’s
boat. With that last one. Would those cleats have lined up?</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: You bet. And if Miyamoto there had been in a
hurry to cast off, he coulda left this line behind on Carl’s boat.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: And replaced it later with the new one.
That’s your inference?</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: Pretty darn clear.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: And when you visited defendant on his boat.
The evening after Carl Heine’s death. Did it seem pretty darn clear to
him?</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: Cut your engine, we’re coming aboard.</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: What for, Sheriff?</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: We have a warrant. To search your boat.</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: Well, what are you looking f…</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: Sheriff, if somebody killed Carl, it sure as
hell wasn’t me.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: Then let’s get this over with, so you can get
to fishin’. Now, cut yor engine.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: You always run with the well open?</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: I was checking the cables.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: D-6s, huh?</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: We’ll come back, let’s take a look at the
stern.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: See you replaced a mooring line, lately. This
one’s new.</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: Naw, I had that around for a while.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: Sure you did. Help me with this hold cover,
willya?</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: There’s nothin’ to see. I need to get out
there fi…</p>
<p><strong>abel</strong>: Art. Looka this.</p>
<p><strong>abel</strong>: There’s blood on it.</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: Fish blood, I gaff fish with that.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: You gaff with the hook end. Blood’s on the
butt. Where your hand goes.</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: Sure. Blood gets all over your hand, Sheriff,
ask any fisherman.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: Gonna have this tested. Now you go home,
okay? Wait til you hear from me.</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: Sheriff, I can’t afford not to fish toni…</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: Look, no way I’m lettin’ you out there. In a
half hour you could be in Canada.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: I’m sorry, son. But you’re under arrest.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Now your testimony was interrupted yesterday,
when that power line set fire to your mother-in-law’s farmhouse…</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: How is your mother-in-law?</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: She’s alright, Nels, thanks for asking.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: And her farmhouse…?</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: The damage was considerable. But she’s
insured. Thanks, again.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Well, just to put it back in our minds, could
you repeat what you told us. About the type of batteries you found. One
Carl’s boat.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: One D-6 and one D-8 in the well. And a dead
D-8 on the deck.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Which you inferred was replaced by the D-6,
which must have been a spare.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: What else could it be?</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Even though a D-6 is too big, and the flange
had to be banged out to squeeze it in. Which makes it a peculiar choice.
For a spare.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: You said that. That was your testimony.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: No further questions.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: So the blood on the gaff was not fish blood at
all. It was human, yes? Type B positive.</p>
<p><strong>dr. whitman</strong>: Carl Heine’s type.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: But you can’t say with any certainty that the
blood was his.</p>
<p><strong>dr. whitman</strong>: No, but as I say, the type is rare. Ten
percent of Caucasian males.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: And the blood could not have belonged to
defendant. Seeing that his type is O negative.</p>
<p><strong>dr. whitman</strong>: That’s obvious.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: You scraped the dried blood from the butt of
the gaff. Where a fella’s hand goes. And what did you see under your
microscope, besides the B positive blood and the wood scrapings…?</p>
<p><strong>dr. whitman</strong>: Bits of blood and wood. What else would
there be?</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: No bits of bone, no particles of scalp, no
strands of hair?</p>
<p><strong>dr. whitman</strong>: None.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Well, if the blood got onto the gaff by
crushing a man’s skull…</p>
<p><strong>dr. whitman</strong>: I’m a hemotologist, sir, I was asked
only t…</p>
<p><strong>dr. whitman</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: You don’t.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: The coroner testified that Carl Heine had a
cut. A fresh cut. Probably one or two hours old.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: On the palm. Of his right hand.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: With no bone or scalp or hair present. Would
it be more probable that the blood came from crushing a man’s skull…</p>
<p><strong>dr. whitman</strong>: I’m a hemotologist, not a
detective.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: …or from the cut on his hand. Which is more
probable?</p>
<p><strong>dr. whitman</strong>: It is not my function. To weigh those
probabilities.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: You’re right.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: …that’s the jury’s job.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: Now this regiment you were training, the
442nd, this was all Nisei boys…</p>
<p><strong>maples</strong>: They were Japanese-American boys, yes
sir.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: And you were generally experienced in
training men for hand-to-hand combat.</p>
<p><strong>maples</strong>: It was my specialty, sir, I trained several
thousand over the years.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: So. Wide cross-section of men to evaluate.
And the day that the defendant volunteered for this… demonstration. Did
you find him eager?</p>
<p><strong>maples</strong>: More than eager. He was out to make a
point.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: And what point. Was that.</p>
<p><strong>maples</strong>: Anyone.</p>
<p><strong>maples</strong>: You don’t salute me, you don’t call me
‘sir’, soldier, I’m an enlisted man.</p>
<p><strong>maples</strong>: And nobody bows in this man’s Army, you’re
in America, son. Not Japan.</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: I’m sorry, sir, force of habit.</p>
<p><strong>maples</strong>: No more ‘sir’. That’s the last of that.</p>
<p><strong>maples</strong>: The exercise is avoiding thrusts. Now, first
y…</p>
<p><strong>maples</strong>: Are you ready for some simulated combat,
soldier?</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: For combat. Sergeant.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: Well, what then, sergeant?</p>
<p><strong>maples</strong>: What else? I had the boy teach me kendo.
Including…the importance of the bow.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: And your evaluation of the defendant? Could
he kill a much larger man with a fishing gaff? So quickly, there would
be no sign of struggle?</p>
<p><strong>maples</strong>: Oh, in a heartbeat.</p>
<p><strong>maples</strong>: Able and willing. Like few men I’ve ever
seen.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: So the plan was for your husband to fish
through the prime season. Then, in November, sell the boat. And you
would move onto the farm.</p>
<p><strong>susan marie</strong>: That was his plan, yes.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Whatever she said, she was Hooks’ star
witness. The jury, especially the men, would not betray this fine lady
with a not guilty verdict. How could they face her?</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: Can you think back for me to the morning of
September 8? The day after your husband purchased the farm. One week
before his death. Can you recall that morning?</p>
<p><strong>susan marie</strong>: I can.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: What could I tell him? There’s my mother to
think about. You know what she’d say?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I said I’d think it over, talk with you.</p>
<p><strong>susan marie</strong>: Did he go away angry?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: He kept talkin’ about those seven acres
belonged to his father, and how honorable and decent his father was. His
meaning was pretty clear. And I didn’t much like it.</p>
<p><strong>susan marie</strong>: You had a scrap.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I couldn’t…talk to him. Look, Kabuo’s a Jap.
And I don’t hate Japs, but I don’t like ’em neither. It’s hard to
explain if you weren’t in the war, you know?</p>
<p><strong>susan marie</strong>: He’s not a Jap. You don’t mean that.
You and he were friends.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: We were kids.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: So your husband said he’s think it over.
Encouraged Mr. Miyamoto to believe he might sell to h…</p>
<p><strong>susan marie</strong>: I wouldn’t say encouraged.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Well, he didn’t say ‘no’, did he? Didn’t say
no hope existed.</p>
<p><strong>susan marie</strong>: Not in those words.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: So the defendant was encouraged to hope. Or
could have been.</p>
<p><strong>susan marie</strong>: I guess so.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: I guess you’d have to guess. Not having been
there with them. Having to guess whether your husband’s report was word
for word accurate.</p>
<p><strong>susan marie</strong>: Carl never lied.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Of course not. But it was emotional. A
friend’s plea set against his mother’s attitude.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Those ‘dirty looks’. Defendant ever aim one of
those at you?</p>
<p><strong>susan marie</strong>: He had no reason to.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Carl ever say he got one?</p>
<p><strong>susan marie</strong>: I can’t speak for him.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: You can speak for what he said. Just like you
did for Mr. Hooks…</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: Objection, badgering the wi…</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Sorry about that, Mrs. Heine. Shall I repeat
the ques…</p>
<p><strong>susan marie</strong>: Carl said he didn’t like Kabuo much
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: The question is more about the defendant’s
attitu…</p>
<p><strong>susan marie</strong>: That’s all he said.</p>
<p><strong>susan marie</strong>: And we can’t ask him anymore.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: My father had bought the DeSoto fifteen
years before. Driving it reminded me of him. Which I considered a
neutral fact…</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Actually, it was pleasant.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Snow made all the fields into one. The
notion that one man might kill another for a small patch, made no
sense.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: But I knew such things occurred. Having
been to war and all.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: May I give you folks a lift?</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: I didn’t look at her. I thought that would
be best.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: My father is grateful for your kindness. But
he will free his car, shortly.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Okay, I’ll help.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: I know it’s caused you trouble. But don’t
you think the snow is beautiful, coming down?</p>
<p><strong>hisao</strong>: Yes, very beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: This trial is unfair. You should write about
that in your newspaper.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: Just that. This trial is wrong, they are
calling a good man a killer. It is only about prejudice, and that is
unfair.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: We all expect the world to be fair. As if
we have some right t…</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: I don’t mean everyone. Just people who can
do things because they can arrest people or convict them. Or run a
newspaper.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Maybe I should write a column. What do you
think?</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: I think people. Should be fair.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: Will you write that?</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: I might just.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: I was part of her life again. I was a
person.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: You have the night watch? On the radio.</p>
<p><strong>levant</strong>: Since September. Last guys got
transferred.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: And you keep the records, or contribute to
’em.</p>
<p><strong>levant</strong>: Shorthard the radio transmis- sions, write
’em up, file ’em in a cabinet. Nobody ever looks. Just take up
space.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: All kinds of radio transmissions? Fisherman
in trouble, and such.</p>
<p><strong>levant</strong>: All kinds. Make yourself at home.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: I’d been back two months. It was the first
time I’d seen her.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: I couldn’t say anything. I just stood
there, hating her.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: I’m sorry about your arm. Kabuo and I. Are
very sor…</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: The Japs did it.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: They shot it off. At Tarawa.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: I’m sorry, I’m sorry I said that.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: I’m sorry about everything. All of it.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: September 16. At 1:42 A.M., the dead of
night. The S.S. West Corona, a Greek-owned freighter, was lost. In heavy
fog.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: They radioed to the lighthouse. They would
have to dogleg, bisecting Ship Channel Bank. And Seaman Philip
Milholland wrote that down. In his report.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Carl Heine drowned. In Ship Channel Bank.
And his watch stopped. At 1:47.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: A huge freighter plowing through. Throwing
a wake big enough to fling any man overboard.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: How long you have this detail?</p>
<p><strong>levant</strong>: Me and Smoltz came on dogwatch September
16.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: You mean, early morning the 16th?</p>
<p><strong>levant</strong>: No, night of the 16th, morning the 17th. We
replaced two guys named Miller and Milholland.</p>
<p><strong>levant</strong>: They got transferred that day. Out to Cape
Flattery.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Some seaman’s loast report. Stuffed in a
cabinet, good as lost forever. No one knows.</p>
<p><strong>levant</strong>: You get what you come for?</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Guess I’m not completely sure. What that
was.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: I left the grocery, and wrote a letter. I
apologizes from my heart. I should never have said that word to her. I
never would again.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: It sat in my desk for two weeks. Before I
threw it away.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: I knew her car. And sometimes when I’d see
it, I’d…drive that way. At a distance.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Can I talk to you?</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: I’m married, Ishmael. It isn’t right for us
to be alone. People will t…</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: There’s no one here, and I’ve got to talk
to you.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Don’t you owe me that?</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: I’m like a dying person.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: I don’t sleep. I tell myself this can’t go
on, but it goes on anyway.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: I did a terrible thing, Ishmael. I knew what
you felt. And what I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: And I never found the courage to tell
you.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: You’ll think this is crazy, but all I want
is to hold you. Just once. And smell your hair.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: You have to hear this, I can never touch
you, Ishmael. Not once, not ever. There’s no half- way. As much as I
know it hurts you, you have to let this go.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Look, I want to forget you, I do. I think
if you hold me, just this once, I can walk away and never speak to you
again.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Please? As one human being to another, just
because I’m miserable and don’t know where to turn. I need to be in your
arms. If it’s just for thirty seconds.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: I hurt for you. Whether you’ll ever believe
that or not.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: I feel sick sometimes, with the guilt of
what I’ve done to you. And I can’t make it right.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: To hold you would be wrong and deceitful.
You’re going to have to live without holding me, that is the truth of
the way things are.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: Things end. They do. Get on with your
life.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: Get on with your life.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: I drove from the lighthouse to my mother’s
place. I brought her some groceries.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Your father thought that heavy snow was God’s
kindness. Despite the hardship, it brought us beauty…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: …and reminded us. Of our place in things.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: You don’t believe in God anymore.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Agnostics don’t believe or disbelieve, Ma.
We just don’t pretend we know.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: We don’t know God, we feel Him. You felt Him
as a child. I remember.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: That’s a long time ago. What a child
feels…that’s different.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Spend the night, will you? Don’t go back out
into all that snow.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: I felt Milholland’s report in my pocket.
And wondered why I wasn’t telling her. Telling someone. What I’d
found.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: You’ve been busy with that trial, I suppose.
Such a travesty…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: They only arrested that poor soul because
he’s Japanese.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Seattle boys think he’s guilty. They say
the evidence is rock solid.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: They’re not his neighbor, like you are. He is
a husband, a father, he risked his life for their country. The same as
you.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Those aren’t the facts that matter.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Well, folks are pretty cold. And folks who
believe in nothing else…they’re cold, too.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I’ve tried to understand your unhappiness,
all these years. Having gone to war, losing your arm…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: But other boys came back. And pushed on. They
found girls, and married, had babies…</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Someday I’ll get lucky, too.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Your father fought at Belleau Wood, it took
him years to get over it. Nightmares, tears, b…</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: …but he found you.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: It isn’t the war, Ishmael. All those years
growing up. You never had a real girl of your own.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: And I know you have it in you to love. I know
that much. I wish I knew more.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: I’ll stay tonight. Thanks for asking.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: I came back from the war to this room. I
stayed a few months. Until my father passed.</p>
<p><strong>nagaishi</strong>: The Japanese people of the island are
saddened by this loss. Your father was a man of great fairness and
compassion for others…</p>
<p><strong>nagaishi</strong>: A friend to us. And to all people.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>nagaishi</strong>: We know you will follow in his footsteps.
And honor his legacy.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: I thought it then. And often since. A
balance, he’s said. Finding the facts. That folks needed to know.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: Dear Ishmael. These things are very
difficult to say. I can’t think of anything more painful than writing
this letter.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: I don’t love you, Ishmael. There is no more
honest way to say it.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: Whenever we were together, I knew it. I
loved you and I didn’t love you at the same moment.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: The last time. At the cedar tree. I knew we
could never be right together. And that soon I would have to tell
you.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: This is the last time I will write to you. I
am not yours anymore.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: I wish you the very best. Your heart is
large and you are gentle and kind. I know you will do great things in
the world.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: I must say good-bye to you now. Our lives
will move on. The best we can.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Milholland’s report was like her letter.
Something no one else. Would ever read.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Thing about having only one hand. It’s hard
to tear pages up. And I wasn’t carrying a match.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: So I thought of my father. The man who
would have taken this report to Judge Fielding.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: But every reporter. Chooses his own
balance. FInds the facts that matter.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: After all, the freighter was only a theory.
It proved nothing at all. There were other facts. That mattered.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Tomorrow I would write a column. About
prejudice. And she would be grateful. For my large…and gentle…heart.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Her husband would be judged. And she would
be alone.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Alone. The past looks different.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: Hopeful. Is the word I would use.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: But Carl didn’t say yes.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: He didn’t say no. That was Kabuo’s point.
Given how Carl’s mother felt, Carl was still willing to consider selling
to us. It was a good sign.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Well, in the week that followed, the week
before Carl’s death… did your husband pursue him?</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: No. Kabuo did not wish to beg, he respected
Carl’s right to reflect. He was sure Carl would do the honorable
thing.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: The night of the 15th, Kabuo helped Carl at
sea. With his dead battery.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: Right there, on the boat, they agreed. $8400
for the seven acres, $800 down. They shook on it. Kabuo was so excited
when he came home.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: And when did you first learn. That Carl had
drowned?</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: One o’clock, that afternoon, from a clerk at
Petersen’s.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: Your husband came home agitated, after his
encounter with the deceased?</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: I said ‘excited’. Not agitated, he was
excited in the sense of being overjoyed.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: You were…overjoyed yourself, to hear the
news?</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: Happy for him. And relieved.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: So, then, you…and your husband… must have
called friends, relatives, to tell them the amazing news. Yes?</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: Really? Didn’t call your mother, your
sisters, about starting a new life. Your husband never tells his
brothers that the family honor is vindicated.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: We hear how Carl…passed away. Only a few
hours later.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: Your husband returned at, what, seven
o’clock?</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: Closer to eight.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: So, five hours. Plenty of time for a call. He
was ‘excited’, you say. In the sense of being ‘overjoyed’.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: We are…cautious people. You would say
conservative. There would be time for celebrating with others when a
paper was signed.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: You thought the deceased might… break his
promise?</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: Of course not. We’re just not quick to run
and boast. In case something went wrong.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: And then, something did. Carl Heine was found
dead. With his head crushed.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: Yes, and then, what was there to call about?
Everything was up in the air.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: Up in the air? Was that your reaction?</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: I would suggest that more happened than a
land sale evaporating. A man died, Mrs. Miyamoto. A husband and father
of small children had his skull bashed in!</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: I see. Well, did you come forward to tell
Sheriff Moran what you knew? The encounter in the fog, the…dead battery,
was it?</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: We discussed that. And decided not to.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: Because the facts could be misconstrued as
murder.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: But if truth was on your side, whatever were
you worried about?</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: Trials aren’t only about truth, Mr. Hooks.
Even though they should be. They’re about what people believe is
true.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: So you hid the truth. Deliberately.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: We were afraid. Silence seemed better. To
come forward seemed like a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: Well, it seems to me…</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: Doesn’t it seem to you, Mrs. Miyamoto, that
your mistake was in being deceitful? Concealing information during the
course of a sheriff’s investigation.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: It seems human. To me.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: I suppose that you mean this excuses
concealing the truth. Then why ahouls any of us believe you now?</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: Question withdrawn, you may step down.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: You’re implying th…</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: I said. No further questions.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: That’s enough, Mrs. Miyamoto, not another
word. Step down, please.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Thirty years fishing alone. Ever had an
occasion to board another man’s boat except in an emergency? Maybe to
socialize or some such?</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Now, Mister Gi…</p>
<p><strong>gillanders</strong>: Unwritten rule of the sea. We don’t
bother each other, stick to ourselves. Ask anybody.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Now if you wanted to kill a man. Think you’d
try boarding against his will, and hitting him with a fishing gaff?</p>
<p><strong>gillanders</strong>: It’s a joke. Maneuver up to Carl’s boat?
Tie your lines fast? Come aboard? All against Carl’s will? It’s the
stupidest suggestion I ever heard of.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: I’m sorry about that. It wasn’t mine in the
first place.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: So the fishing gaff method wouldn’t make
sense?</p>
<p><strong>gillanders</strong>: Couldn’t get on the boat. I’d just shoot
the feller. Then tie up, throw him inta th’ drink. And skip bein’ the
first gill-netter in history to make a successful forced boarding.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Now the sheriff believed that the D-6 battery
in Carl’s well was Carl’s own spare. Even though it was too large f…</p>
<p><strong>gillanders</strong>: No sense to have any at all., even the
right size. It’s like having an extra battery in the trunk of your car.
Nobody does.</p>
<p><strong>gillanders</strong>: Boat has two batteries. Lose one you run
off the other til morning. Carl musta lost both, so Miyamoto there gave
him one a his.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Course, if Carl lost both batteries, dead in
the water, his radio wouldn’t work. So how would he signal for help?</p>
<p><strong>gillanders</strong>: Compressed air horn, most likely. Hope
to God some man hears you in that fog.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: All right, what if the defendant heard? So
Carl let him aboard, to help. And then the fishing gaff?</p>
<p><strong>gillanders</strong>: You mean Miyamoto followed him out
there, and sucker-punched him?</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Well, what if?</p>
<p><strong>gillanders</strong>: Now, how is Miyamoto gonna know in
advance? That Carl loses two batteries. Must happen once ever’ 20 years
or so.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Thank you, Mr. Gillanders. Thank you for
coming down, in this cold weather.</p>
<p><strong>gillanders</strong>: Well, it does seem mighty warm in here.
Specially for Mr. Hooks.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: What if the defendant follows Carl. And
pretends his own batteries are dead? Would Carl tie up and help?</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: Is the word you’re groping for…‘yes’,
perha…</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Alvin!</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: Rephrase. Do you agree that he might tie up
to the defendant’s bo…</p>
<p><strong>gillanders</strong>: So why’s the D-6 in Carl’s well?</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: Who’s to say? Maybe it was just a spare,
after all. Or maybe the defendant left it, as a potential alibi. In case
somebody saw him in Ship Channel Bank. In case we put two and two
together, knowing of the hostility. Between the families.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: My question is. Could Carl have tied up to
help the defendant?</p>
<p><strong>gillanders</strong>: It coulda happened. And if I start to
say it’s doubtful, you’d probl’y say ‘no further questions’, right?</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: Right about that. And right that it ‘coulda
happened’.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: Thanks for your help. Hope the witness box
wasn’t too warm for your comfort.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: But the toughest scenario. Is the one Hooks
will never raise.</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: And what’s that?</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: That you came upon Carl by accident. Like you
said. Gave him the battery. Like you said. Asked him about the seven
acres. Like you said.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Only. He said no.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: And something…happened. That you’d never
planned. Because you’re not a cold-blooded killer.</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: I’m more a hot-blooded killer, huh? Like a
soldier. Like a samurai.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: You won’t hear that from Hooks. Because the
charge is first-degree murder, which requires premeditation. He can’t
change the charge.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: So if the jury thinks you did kill. but only
in the heat of anger. They have to acquit.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: And you couldn’t. Be. Re-tried.</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: You want me to say that.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: I want you. To tell the truth.</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: You think that is the truth.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: I told your wife. Trials aren’t always so much
about actual truth. As about what folks believe is true. That’s sad. And
it’s real.</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: And what do you believe?</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: A question first. Why do you want to know?</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: I believe you are a good man. Who belongs with
his family.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: And I believe. You didn’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: My batteries are drawed down, both of ’em.
ALternator belts were loose.</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: No sweat. We’ll pull one a mine, get ya
started.</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: You lashed up a lantern? ’Gainst a fog like
this?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Lantern and a air horn. That’s all I got,
without my juice.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Don’t know how long it’s take to get a
charge…</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: Keep it tonight. We’ll catch fish. I’ll see
ya back on the docks…</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Seven acres. I’m wonderin’ what you’d pay for
’em. Just curious, is all.</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: What are you sellin’ ’em for? Why don’t we
start there.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Did I say I was selling? But if I was, I’d
have to figure you want ’em real bad. Oughta charge a sall fortune,
maybe…</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Then again. Maybe you’d want your battery
back.</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: The battery’s in, that’s done with. Besides,
you’d do the same for m…</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: …might do the same. I have to warn you ’bout
that, chief. I’m not screwed together like I used to be.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Hell, I’m sorry, okay? About the whole damn
mess. If I’d a been around, my mother wouldn’t a pulled it off that
way.</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: I killed men who looked just like you,
pig-fed German bastards. And their blood don’t wash off so easy.</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: So don’t talk to me about Japs, you big Nazi
son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I am a bastard. I’m a big Hun Nazi son of a
bitch. And I still got your bamboo fishing rod.</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: Oh, yeh?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Hid it from my mom. Caught a mess a sea runs.
Damn thing’s still in my closet.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: $1200 an acre, that’s what I paid Ole, won’t
take a dime less. You got no choice on that.</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: Didn’t say I was buyin’ did I? What you want
down? Just bein’ curious, is all.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: A thousand down. We’ll sign papers
t’morrow.</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: Eight hundred. And it’s a deal.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: For the life of me, sir, I cannot imagine why
you kept this story from the sheriff.</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: As my wife testified, we were considering
it.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: Actually, she said you had decided. Decided
not not come forward.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: Except even when Sheriff Moran arrested you.
You said nothing about seeing Carl.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: At that point, you were already under
suspicion. The battery story explained things. If the story was true…and
not simply something you thought up later…</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: Why. Didn’t you. Tell it?</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: Sheriff said right off, I was under
suspicion. I didn’t have a lawyer…</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: But even after you had an attorney. You still
claimed to know nothing. Claimed not to have seen Carl. Am I
correct?</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: Yes. Initially.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: Well, ‘initially’ is an interesting word,
sir. You’d been arrested, you had a lawyer, and you still claimed
ignorance!</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: I should have told everything right away. I
know that now, and I regret it.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: Should have told ‘everything’. Meaning, you
should have told the truth.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: Nothing to say?</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: My apologies. Do you regret not telling the
truth?</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: I have told the truth.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: You mean, this morning. The new story, the
battery story. That one is the truth? That’s a question, sir.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: I see. Now what happened the day Carl Heine
was found? Before your arrest.</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: I slept til one-thirty, when my wife woke me
up with the news. We talked for a few hours. I left at six and went
straight to my boat.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: Didn’t go anywhere else? No errands, no
purchases? Just straight to the boat. That’s the truth.</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: Well, the sheriff found two batteries in your
well. If you left one with Carl Heine, how is that possible?</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: I had a spare battery in my shed. I brought
it down, and put it in just before the sheriff showed up.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: Conveniently, in your shed. Only you didn’t
mention that a moment ago. Why does this battery story change every time
a new question is raised?</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: You asked if I went straight to the boat. I
did. With the battery.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: You’re a hard man to trust, sir. You sit
before us, with no expression, keeping a poker f…</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Objection!</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: You know better than that, Mr. Hooks. Either
ask questions that count for something, or sit down and be done with
it.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Shame on you.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: I apologize to the court, for letting my
feelings get the better of me.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: No other questions. We’ll go to
summation.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: …believing that Etta Heine’s son would never
sell him the land. Land that in his mind, filtered through ancient rules
of behavior handed down from his ancestors’ culture, belonged to his
family by right…</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: His only choice to get the land would be to
eliminate Carl Heine. So that Ole Jurgensen would need a new buyer.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: In his mind. Seen through codes of revenge
difficult for us to fathom, this was also the only way to avenge what he
felt to be the grievous dishonor brought to his father, his family…</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: …to a thousand years of ancestry, in a
foreign land we still find an enigma. Despite our recent bitter
experience with its ways.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: Thus believing cold-blooded murder to be
justified…he trailed Carl Heine… could hear his engine in the fog…and
sounded his own horn, claiming distress.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: As Carl pulled alongside: ‘Please, Carl,’ the
defendant must have said. ‘I am sorry for what has come between us, but
adrift here in the fog, I plead for your help!’</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: And so this good man tied his boat fast,
while his enemy leaps aboard, striking the treacherous blow he was
trained to strike by his father’s hand.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: The feud over these seven acres had festered
for eight years. He argued with Carl about buying the land one week
before Carl was killed. Carl’s skull was crushed, and his blood is on a
murder weapon with which the defendant is a deadly expert!</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: And after a series of lies. The defendant at
last admits he was there. Alone on the boat. In the fog. Carl Heine’s
blood on his fishing gaff.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: My lord. My lord.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: Look clearly at the defendant. See the truth
self-evident in him. And in the facts of this case.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: Look into his eyes, ladies and gentlemen,
consider his face. And ask yourself what your duty is as citizens of
this community.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: …not a single witness has testified to
anything that could suggest pre- meditated murder. Not in the days
before Carl Heine’s death…or at any time…has anyone described a
murderous rage toward the deceased.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Etta Heine had cheated his family. He had
asked his childhood friend Carl to sell him the land. And Carl was
considering it.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: There is no evidence of anger at Carl, much
less rage, much less murderous rage. No reason for premeditation and no
evidence of it. Anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: And yet the state is required to prove these
things. Beyond. A reasonable. Doubt.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Can you seriously think there is no reasonable
doubt? Why is Kabuo’s D-6 battery in Carl’s well, if Carl was helping
him?</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Why isn’t the blood on the gaff more
consistent with Carl’s hand wound than a skull fracture? Given the
absence of bone or brain tissue.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: What Mr. Hooks asks you to believe is that no
proof is needed. Against a man who bombed Pearl Harbor.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Look at his face, the prosecutor said.
Presuming that you will see an enemy there. Treacherous by nature, by a
thousand years of something or other.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: An argument I find as despicable as it is
dishonest and twisted and insulting to us all. Mr. Miyamoto is a
much-decorated hero of the United States Army. For God’s sake.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: If someone said you should convict Carl Heine.
Or his lovely widow. Of murder. Without proof. Because their ancestry is
the same as Hitler’s. You would spit in his eye.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: And every decent American. Would applaud
you.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Now Kabuo Miyamoto did one thing wrong. He was
afraid to trust us, at first. Afraid that he would be crucified by
prejudice. As Mr. Hooks is urging you to do.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Well, we sent him. And his wife. And thousands
of Americans to concentration camps. They lost homes, belongings,
everything. We did that, folks. Can we now be unforgiving about his
uncertainty? His mistrust?</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: You may think this is a small trial. In a
small place. Well, it isn’t.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Every once in awhile. Somewhere in the world.
Humanity goes on trial. And integrity. And decency. Every once in
awhile, common folks get called on to give the report card for the human
race.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Now here in America. We relish those chances.
Give us that one, we say. That’s why we built this country in the first
place.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Be Americans. Make your children proud.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: I’m awful sorry, Ma’am, but you know I c…</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: What are you afraid of, Sheriff?</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: Am I going to slip him a weapon for a mad
escape? Perhaps a kendo staff hidden in my dress?</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: There’s rules.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: Well, please break them, then. I won’t keep
you a moment.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: I love you. And tomorrow, when I make our
bed. I’m setting out your pillow.</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: Only if you ask me nice.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: Did you write that column?</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: I did. But the jury won’t s…</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: It’s not for the. They only get to convict
him.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: It’s the judge who decides. If he’ll
hang.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: You don’t think he did this.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: I know he didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: Come to supper, tonight. My mother would be
proud to have you with us.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Tell your mom. I want a rain check.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: You have a visitor, son.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: You said three minutes.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Won’t take two.</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: Please, sit down…</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: She told me you’re writing a column. We’re
very grateful.</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: She. Said you two go way back…</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: That’s nice.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: You said there was a lantern in his hand.
When you found him in the fog.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: And another one. Lashed to the mast?</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Two. Lanterns.</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: If I did the math right.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: It’s the sheriff’s math. I’m wondering
about.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: Blackmail. That’s all it is.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: I call it keeping your promise. We said if
I ever needed some cooperation from you…</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: You threatened me, Chambers, pure and simple.
And what idiot’s gonna believe some cock and bull story that I made a
deal to keep stuff outta your paper? Not that anybody reads your
paper.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Same idiots who’ll believe you cracked this
case. When I tell ’em you did.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: See, no lantern.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: Never shoulda given you that inventory in the
first place.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: It’s public record. If the public cares
enough to read it.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: You said there was a coffee c…</p>
<p><strong>abel</strong>: It’s the only thing I moved, I swear. It was
right there.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: You wanna see that in the papers? Don’t ever
touch something at a cri…</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: One lantern. Like the inventory says. Sorry
to disappoint you.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Actually. I was hoping you got it right.
What’s that, up there?</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: Nothin’. Bits of string.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Pieces of twine aren’t nothing.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: Here now, what are you fixin’ to do?</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Have a look. At nothing.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: You can’t go up there, touch things…</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: You gonna climb that with one arm?</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: You’re right. I better use two.</p>
<p><strong>abel</strong>: There’s lots of ’em, Art, look.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: A dozen or more, all figure eights. All cut
clean through on an angle.</p>
<p><strong>abel</strong>: And look at that streak of rust, across the
mast.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: It’s on the twine, too. But it’s not r…</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: Don’t prove there was two lanterns. Coulda
been the one in the cabin.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: There’s a stretch of ground between
guessin’ and provin’, Sheriff. I’ll give you that.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: What do you think you’re lookin’ at now?</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Not what I’m looking at. It’s what I’m
looking for.</p>
<p><strong>alexander van ness</strong>: Well. I guess it comes down to a
feeling, don’t it? If I feel uncertain, I feel a doubt. Isn’t that
it?</p>
<p><strong>harold jensen</strong>: Alex, nobody ain’t ever sure about
nothin’. It’s unreasonable to be so stubborn that you think you’re
smarter than eleven folks who all agree!</p>
<p><strong>edith twardzik</strong>: The man sat there and admitted he
lied, Mr. Van Ness. Now why isn’t that enough for you?</p>
<p><strong>alexander van ness</strong>: We’re not tryin’ him for lying.
Lots of us told lies, one time or another. Prob’ly none of us murdered
anybody.</p>
<p><strong>harold jensen</strong>: But what drives a man to lie? Means
he’s hiding somethin’.</p>
<p><strong>alexander van ness</strong>: Not necessarily that he killed
Carl. I’m not sayin’ you’re wrong, just that I have my doubts.</p>
<p><strong>burke latham</strong>: Look, if you changed chairs right now,
cos you doubted that maybe a chunk of the moon was gonna fall through
the roof, that wouldn’t be a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p><strong>alexander van ness</strong>: I think it does. Miyamoto was on
Carl’s boat, or vice-versa. Not much doubt about th…</p>
<p><strong>alexander van ness</strong>: There’s a chance it came from
his hand.</p>
<p><strong>burke latham</strong>: There’s a chance of everything. But
you add a chance from here and a chance from there, the world ain’t made
a coincidences only.</p>
<p><strong>edith twardzik</strong>: Look, if he gave Carl a battery like
he said, he’d only a had one left. Not two.</p>
<p><strong>alexander van ness</strong>: He explained that. He replaced
it.</p>
<p><strong>roger porter</strong>: Alex, stop arguin’ just to argue. You
can see what really happened, same as us. Isn’t that what we’re supposed
to do is tell the actual truth? My God, Carl died, here.</p>
<p><strong>alexander van ness</strong>: So I don’t care Carl died,
unless I’m ready to reach for the hangman’s rope? You oughta stop tryin’
to bully me into hurrying.</p>
<p><strong>burke latham</strong>: Been six hours. You sayin’ there’s a
way to go slower?</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Well. It’s imaginative…</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: …I’ll give you that.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: It’s the way it happened, I know it is.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: No, you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: That report. About the freighter? You didn’t
find that tonight, did you?</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: You went right to the cell. Then to the boat.
Then here. How long did you know about the freighter?</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: This tastes horrible, hmmn?</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: You’re wondering why I held it.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: I’m wondering how the judge is gonna like my
waking up his old bones. in the middle of the night.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Your daddy. Was quite a feller.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Yes, he was.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: He’s looking down. And he’s not thinking ’bout
the man you were yesterday. He’s proud of the man you are tonight.
That’s what counts.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: To my father. Everything counts.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: What if I told you he once said to me…don’t
matter the road we take. Just so we get there.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Doesn’t make me wrong.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: All right, let’s say that twine had been there
to lash a lantern. That it had come from the shuttle of twine found in
the deceased’s pocket.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Now to re-open a trial that had gone to
jury…new evidence should be pretty important.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Tell us why that lantern would be so
significant.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Well. It shows the prosecutor was wrong. It
was Carl’s boat that was dead in the water. Or he’d never have put up
the lantern.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Now you believe there were two lanterns when
defendant arrived. One in Carl’s hand. The second lashed to the
mast.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: That’s what Mr. Miyamoto reported, and he’d
have no reason to lie. He couldn’t know that it would help his case.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Well, why does it?</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Because the second lantern, the one on the
mast. Was never found. So we have to ask…</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: …where did it go?</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Maybe it went. Where Carl went. Over the
side.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: Objection! Speculation.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Your Honor, all of this is speculation.
Including Mr. Hooks’ dramaturgy about the defendant issuing a false
distress call.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: Tht was summation, Your H…</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: So how does this fit with what you told us at
the start? The freighter that plowed through Ship Channel Bank…</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: That’s when he fell.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Fell.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Miyamoto gave him the battery, and left.
Carl’s boat was running, he goes back to fishing. But at some point, he
thinks of the lantern…</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Still lashed to the mast.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: He figures a perfectly good lantern could
get banged around up there. So he climbs up. To cut it down.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Just as the freighter comes through? Isn’t
that quite a coincidence?</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Coincidences happen. You run a yellow light
just as a car comes out of nowhere. Split-second tragedy happens every
day. Or maybe…</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Maybe…?</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Maybe Carl picks up something about the
freighter on his radio, which is now working. Same report Milholland
heard. And that makes him get the lantern fast. Before the freighter’s
wake can bang it around.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: But you could be wrong. He could have climbed
up earlier.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Then where’s the lantern? And where’s the
knife?</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: The knife. What knife?</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Coroner found an empty knife sheath on
Carl’s belt. But they never found the knife.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: He climbs up. His hand wound still
bleeding. That’s the blood I found on the mast. And the twine.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: He cuts the lantern free, the freighter’s
wake hits, the boat rolls hard, his bloody hand slips. tracing blood
along the mast…</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: He falls. The lantern, the knife, go into
the water. Same as Carl.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: And inside the cabin, a coffee cup falls
off the counter.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: But there’s no one around. To pick it
up.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Still a coincidence. Timing and all.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: The freighter started through at 1:42. The
sea water seeped into Carl’s watch and stopped it. At 1:47.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Still and all. Carl was a strong swimmer, he
m…</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: He hit his head. On the way in.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: You think so?</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: The sheriff and the deputy and I inspected
the deck closely. We found a small fracture in the wood of the gunnel.
Just below the mast.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Well, anything coulda caused that.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Anything. That had a blond hair.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Request introduction of Exhibit 18. One single
blond hair. Which Sheriff Moran dug out of that fracture. Below the
mast. Of Carl Heine’s boat.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: We will call Sheriff Moran, who will confirm
this. And Coroner Whaley to testify that the damage to the gunnel is of
a size and nature not inconsistent with the deceased’s skull
fracture…</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: But for now. Your witness…</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: I have to start reading your paper more
closely. You’re quite a storyteller.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: Everything had to happen just right. For your
little story to fly. I mean, a blond hair could be on that gunnel for a
lot of reasons.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: I’m sorry, was there a question in
there?</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: Well, the freighter. The twine. The blood.
The knife. The cup. The watch. The second battery. The phantom lantern.
The fishing gaff. The cracked gunnel. The skull wound. The blond hair.
That’s eleven things…</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Twelve.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: I stand corrected, sir. And you have a neat
explanation for every one of them.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: And since you confess this is all pure
guesswork. What is your expertise, sir, are you a detective of
sorts?</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: My expertise. Is that I’m a journalist.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: And journalism. Is balance. Finding the
facts folks need to know.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Then putting them together. So truth is
revealed.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: But isn’t the truth that there are several
other ways to explain each of these twelve pieces.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Oh, yes.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: But no other way. To explain them all.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: And since they all happened. This is the
only explanation that’s the truth.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: Your line of work. You must meet a lot of men
play fast and loose with the truth.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Like you couldn’t believe.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: Well, the defendant is a liar. He’s confessed
that much. And his explanation is…he was afraid.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: Afraid that the good folks of this jury.
Would be too stupid to understand. Too prejudiced to be fair.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: You buy that?</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: Greedy.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: He didn’t want to lose any more.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: He’d lost a lot in the war, you see. I had
sent him away. To a concentration camp. But a nice one. Far less brutal
than the Nazis. Because I’m a civilized person.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: I asked you a question, you’re writing a
tract, h…</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: That’s how journalists. Answer
questions.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: May I answer the question, Your Honor?
Anout the defendant’s motivation to lie?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: I wouldn’t miss it for the world, son. Now,
you say you sent the defendant to Manzanar?</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: I didn’t say. I did it alone.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: So there he was. His father lost his health
there, finally died. They lost more than Etta Heine’s seven acres. They
lost their liberty, their dignity. Their ideals about this country.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: They lost their trust in us. We had treated
them worse than animals. How would we now see tham. As human beings?</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: This man lost a lot in the war. He didn’t
want now to lose his babies. Or the woman who loves him.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: And my expertise in this, sir. Is that I
lost a lot in the war myself.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: And the fact that I am the only witness.
Who placed his right hand upon the Holy Bible. Is the least of it, sir.
I assure you of that.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: Well, sir. I hate to spoil the soliloquy, I
truly do. But the fact is…you are not on trial here. Nor is Judge
Fielding, or myself. Nor the good people of this jury. For events that
took place twelve years ago.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: And I wouldn’t blame these good people if
they were a mite resent- ful. At a tactic that insults their
intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: That’s curious. I was appealing to their
intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>hooks</strong>: Were you, sir? Can you prove one word of all
your fancy story?</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: No, sir, I can’t. Not beyond a reasonable
doubt.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: It’s fortunate that the man who needs to
prove his fancy story. Beyond a reasonable doubt. Is someone else.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: I’m sorry, Mr. Hooks. I apologize for my
tone. This is not a contest. Between you and me.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: For it is not. As Mr. Gudmundsson so wisely
put it. A small trial. In a small place.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: I lost more in that war than anyone will
ever know. So did a lot of folks. And what we got back in return…</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: …was a country. Where a man was innocent.
Until we proved him guilty.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Whether we all got cheated. We’re about to
find out.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: All things considered…</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: …you were adequate.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: I could make a few quibbles, but I am loathe
to hurt your feelings.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Cigarette?</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: I’ll take two. One for later.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: I’ve always thought so.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: If I whistle. Those boys’ll see you, and come
runnin’. You’re the story today.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: You ever been strangled by a single
hand?</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Naw, I’ve seen what that can do to a pack of
cigarettes.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Better take three…</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Maybe they’ll keep us waiting.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Prejudice is like any obsession.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: There’s a reason why we can’t let go. Even
when we want to.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: A reason.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Hate or love. It works the same.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Your client’s wife ever mention? We go way
ba…</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: We don’t let go, you s…</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: It’s a rare thing. Takes a turning point.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: You gave this jury three chances. To turn.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: No other way to explain it all. That was one.
I caught some of ’em fluttering, waking up, on that.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Second. You sent him to Manzanar, and you
didn’t do it alone. I liked that one, they didn’t. No surprise.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Last. You gave your arm. To buy this woman
back her husband. Are they gonna cheat you out of that?</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Some let go, some don’t. Where did you?</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: She was an honest person. Doing the best
she could.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: The prosecutor, the judge, cut her off. She
was desperate. Her husband helpless…I was helpless…</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: You couldn’t let her. Be helpless.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: When this verdict is read. She may look for
your face.</p>
<p><strong>nels</strong>: Here’s what she needs to see: This is nothing.
We win it on appeal.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: It’ll be there.</p>
<p><strong>harold jensen</strong>: We have, Your Honor.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Will the bailiff please bring the verdict to
the bench.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Will the foreman please read the verdict
aloud.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: This is your verdict, so say you all?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: This Court thanks you for the good work you
have done under difficult circumstances…</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Go home, son. God bless.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #1</strong>: And how about the jury? You had
confidence they’d see justice done?</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: Oh, sure. These are our neighbors, you know.
They’ve got good hearts. We could see they were following the evidence
real close…</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: We’re just grateful to every one of them.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #2</strong>: And you ma’am? You felt the same as
your husband, I expect?</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: Honestly, no.</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: And Mr. Chambers did that.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #3</strong>: …can we get some background on your
handsome family? I understand you two were childhood sweethearts…</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: Well, no sir, not exactly. We met in the
Manzanar camp, you see, so I guess that was the most beautiful place
I’ve ever been.</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: No, her first love was another fella…</p>
<p><strong>kabuo</strong>: I was the lucky one.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #4</strong>: It all sounds very romantic, ma’am.
Falling in love under those circumstances…</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: He went off to the Army, right from
Manzanar. And that last night, we danced alone in the desert…</p>
<p><strong>hatsue</strong>: I told him. If you don’t come back alive,
I’ll kill you.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: God’s kindness, my father said. Despite the
hardship…it reminds us. Of our place in things.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: What the hell. Did he mean by that?</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Things fall on us, I suppose. From the
sky.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Wars. Freighters plowing through…</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: And we seem…helpless. Until we
understand.</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Accident rules every corner of the
universe…</p>
<p><strong>ishmael</strong>: Except the chambers. Of the human
heart.</p>
