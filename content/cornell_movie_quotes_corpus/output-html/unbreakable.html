<p><strong>saleswoman</strong>: This is Mr. Mathison. He’s a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>dr. mathison</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>saleswoman</strong>: An ambulance is on the way.</p>
<p><strong>dr. mathison</strong>: Is there a name yet?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Elijah.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Is he supposed to be crying like that?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Can I have him back?</p>
<p><strong>dr. mathison</strong>: What happened during the delivery?</p>
<p><strong>older saleswoman</strong>: Nothing. It was very quick. The
baby just wanted to come right out. There was no problems.</p>
<p><strong>dr. mathison</strong>: Did you drop him?</p>
<p><strong>dr. mathison</strong>: Did you drop this baby?</p>
<p><strong>older saleswoman</strong>: Jesus Christ, no.</p>
<p><strong>dr. mathison</strong>: Please inform the ambulance we have a
situation…</p>
<p><strong>dr. mathison</strong>: I’ve never seen this… It appears your
infant sustained some fractures while in your uterus. His arms and legs
are broken.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Someone left these. You want one?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You like sports?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: It’s my field. I represent athletes. I’m an
agent.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What a coincidence? I’m a male synchronized
swimmer and I’m looking for representation.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: But I’m afraid of water, so that’s been
holding my career back a little bit.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You represent someone in Philadelphia?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: I’m meeting a player from Temple University.
He’s a cornerback. You like football?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Not really.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: This kid is six foot two, two hundred and
forty pounds. He runs the fifty in under six seconds. He’s going to be a
God.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’m David Dunne.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Kelly.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: How long are you staying in Philly?</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I think you got the wrong idea.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: I’m going to find another seat.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: You okay, Virginia?</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: I’ll put something on the t.v. Maybe we’ll
find some almost naked guys to inspire you.</p>
<p><strong>man in scrubs</strong>: How are you feeling?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>man in scrubs</strong>: You are in the emergency room of the
University of Pennsylvania Hospital. You were in a serious accident.
How’s your vision?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>man in scrubs</strong>: Where were you sitting on the
train?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Against a window.</p>
<p><strong>man in scrubs</strong>: In the passenger car?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Yes. Where are the rest of the
passengers?</p>
<p><strong>man in scrubs</strong>: Was your family traveling with
you?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>man in scrubs</strong>: Did you get up from your seat?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>man in scrubs</strong>: You’re certain you were in the
passenger car?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Yes… Why are you looking at me like that?</p>
<p><strong>man in scrubs</strong>: Your train derailed… Some kind of
malfunction… It took a curve way to fast. A second train collided with
yours after it derailed. The debris is spread over one mile. It’s
unbelievable they said. They only found two people alive so far… You and
him.</p>
<p><strong>man in scrubs</strong>: The man’s skull was cracked open and
most of his left side was crushed.</p>
<p><strong>man in scrubs</strong>: And to answer your question, there
are two reasons why I’m looking at you like this.</p>
<p><strong>man in scrubs</strong>: One, because it seems, in a few
minutes, you will officially be the only survivor of this train wreck.
And two, because you don’t have a scratch on you. You didn’t break one
bone.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: I told you!</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: They thought everybody on the train
died.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: I told them they were wrong.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: Mom even cried.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: A lot.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Not a lot.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: Let’s go home.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I don’t think I got the job in New York.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’m still going to New York. Just not this
second.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: I don’t want to drag this out too long for
Jeremy.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: How about in the meantime, you don’t sleep in
the guestroom anymore? You sleep in our room. I’ll sleep down here.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: It stopped being our room a long time ago.
You should go up and get some rest.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Jeremy, why don’t you go sleep with your
mom?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I think it’s be better if I was alone.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: How about your room then? If you get scared
like before, you can come back in here?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: We’ll play the water pistol game next.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Elijah…</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: I won’t get hurt momma! I’m safe!</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Sarah Elaston, social worker at Broad and
Locust Community Center. We pray for your soul. Kevin Elliott, business
man, father of six. We pray for your soul. Glen Stevens, researcher in
the area of Leukemia at Drexel University. We pray for your soul.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: …Jennifer Pennyman, third grade teacher at
Jefferson Elementary. We pray for your soul.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I used to play football in college. In my
first year as quarterback, we went on this winning streak. It just went
on and on. It didn’t matter who we played… I’d always win. You get
superstitious when something like that happens. You give things meaning.
Like you wear the same color socks each game or you listen to the same
B.B. King song before you leave the apartment. I wouldn’t even untie the
shoelaces on my cleats. I’d just slip them on and off so nothing would
change… I gave things meaning that had no meaning. I’m here to make sure
I’m not making shoelaces into something they’re not again. I was the
only person to survive that accident. The only one… It feels like it
means something.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Are you a religious man, David?</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Good. Because I’m going to talk to you as a
man. Not as a man of the cloth.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: It was luck.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Luck… Random… Without meaning.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Three years ago, my cousin died on a plane
that crashed on take off at Philadelphia International airport. Do you
remember that crash?</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: I prayed and prayed and finally found some
meaning in the event. It gave me peace… And then not quite a year later,
an entire family from my parish burned to death in a hotel fire
downtown… Again I prayed. Again I found meaning. Just two days ago, my
nephew rode with you on that train back from New York. He was traveling
alone for the first time.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: I’m sorry if I can’t react to your survival
with the appropriate ‘It was the hand of God. It was a miracle.’ kind of
answer… I’m fresh out of those right now.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: My twelve year old nephew’s neck was broken
in four places… What’s your point? You were chosen? I don’t think
so.</p>
<p><strong>ancient secretary</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Is Noel in?</p>
<p><strong>ancient secretary</strong>: No sir he is not. I read about
you in the paper.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>ancient secretary</strong>: I was in an accident once too. A
horse almost trampled me to death.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p><strong>ancient secretary</strong>: I had to put him down.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: That’s a sad story. Do you think you could
ask Noel something for me?</p>
<p><strong>ancient secretary</strong>: Proceed.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Ask if he can check how many sick days I’ve
taken since I’ve worked here?</p>
<p><strong>ancient secretary</strong>: Is that the entire message?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You know what I think about to calm down? I
think about those big fat, hundred and twenty pound turtles that live in
the islands. Those suckers never get angry, never get in fights and live
longer than all of us and all they do all is sit on the beach and hump
other turtles. Why don’t we take a second and think about the
turtles?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Yeah Jerry why don’t you think about the fat
ass turtles… Like your fat ass son on the field jeopardizing the rest of
our chances at a fucking championship.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Hey Noel.</p>
<p><strong>noel</strong>: Forty dollars.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>noel</strong>: You’re getting a forty dollar raise per week…
that’s it.</p>
<p><strong>noel</strong>: I checked. You were right. You’ve never taken
a sick day. Five years, no sick days. I get it. You want a raise. You
made your point.</p>
<p><strong>noel</strong>: All right fifty dollars and that’s the god
damn limit. Are we done here?</p>
<p><strong>elijah’s mother</strong>: No more sitting in this room. I’ve
let it go on long enough.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: I’m not going out anymore. I’m not getting
hurt again. This was the last time. I told you.</p>
<p><strong>elijah’s mother</strong>: You can’t do anything about that.
You might fall between that chair and this television. If that’s what
God has planned for you, that’s what’s going to happen. You can’t hide
from it in your room.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: They call me Mr. Glass at school. Cause I
break like glass.</p>
<p><strong>elijah’s mother</strong>: …You make this decision now to be
afraid… And you’ll never turn back your whole life. You’ll always be
afraid.</p>
<p><strong>elijah’s mother</strong>: …I got a present for you.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>elijah’s mother</strong>: Forget why. Do you want it or
not?</p>
<p><strong>elijah’s mother</strong>: Well, go get it then.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: Where is it?</p>
<p><strong>elijah’s mother</strong>: On a bench, across the street.</p>
<p><strong>elijah’s mother</strong>: You calling me a liar?</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: Someone’s gonna take it.</p>
<p><strong>elijah’s mother</strong>: Then you better get out there
soon.</p>
<p><strong>elijah’s mother</strong>: I bought a whole bunch. They’ll be
one of these waiting for you, every time you want to come out here.</p>
<p><strong>elijah’s mother</strong>: They said this one has a surprise
ending.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: This is from Fritz Champion’s own library. This
is before the first issue of the comic book hit the stands in 1968.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: It’s a classic depiction of good versus
evil. Notice the square jaw of Slayer - common in most comic book
heroes. And the slightly disproportionate size of Jaguaro’s body to his
head. This again is common, but only in villains… The thing to notice
about this piece… The thing that makes it very, very special… is its
realistic depiction of its figures. When the characters eventually made
it into the magazine they were exaggerated… as always happens. This is
vintage.</p>
<p><strong>business man</strong>: Wrap it up.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: You’ve made a considerably wise
decision.</p>
<p><strong>business man</strong>: My kid’s gonna go berserk.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: Once again please?</p>
<p><strong>business man</strong>: My son Jeb. It’s a gift for him.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: How old is Jeb?</p>
<p><strong>business man</strong>: Four.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: No, no, no, no no… You need to go now.</p>
<p><strong>business man</strong>: What did I say?</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: Do you see any Telletubbies around here?… Do
you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed
on it?… Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression sitting
outside in a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put a quarter in
it?… No?… Well that’s what you see at a toy store? Any you must think
this is a toy store, cause you’re in here shopping for an infant named
Jeb. One of us has made a gross error and wasted the other person’s
valuable time…</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: This is an art gallery my friend. This is
piece of art…</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: This is one of seventeen original drawings
by Fritz Champion remaining in the world. It’s value will triple every
year… This piece is to be treasured. To be cherished… To be coveted by
every single one of your banker friends that think they’re better than
you.</p>
<p><strong>business man</strong>: What if I kept it?</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: I’m listening.</p>
<p><strong>business man</strong>: I’ll keep it in my office room.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: What about Jeb?</p>
<p><strong>business man</strong>: I have a lock on the door.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: Will it be near a window?</p>
<p><strong>businessman</strong>: No direct sunlight will fall on it.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: Come back in three days. I’ll think about
it.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: We’re by appointment only.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I received a card from your store.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: Congratulations, you have a mailbox… The
sale isn’t for two weeks.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: This one was under the windshield of my
car.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: You’ve never been sick?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I don’t know for sure. …I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: Well if this ain’t a riddle worthy of the
Riddler?</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: So let’s get some of the usual questions out
of the way. Why am I using a cane? Raise your hand if you were thinking
that.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: I fractured my leg. It’s the fifth time I’ve
done that particular bone. It didn’t really heal well this time.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: Raise your hand is you’re wondering who the
hell breaks the same bone five times?</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: I have something called Osteogenesis
Imperfecta. It’s a genetic disorder. I don’t make this particular type
of protein very well and it makes my bones very low in density, very
easy to break. I’ve had fifty-four breaks in my life. I have the tamest
version of the disorder… Type one. There are type two, type three, and
type four. Type four’s don’t make it very long… That ends our lecture on
the medical anomaly known as Elijah Price.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: How certain are you that you haven’t been
sick in your life?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Seventy-five percent.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: Seventy-five percent? That’s not nearly good
enough for me. I’m extremely skeptical.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Skeptical about what?</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: Your answer to my question. It’s one thing
to have never been injured in your life, but to state that you’ve never
taken ill, well that’s a whole new level.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: Dad’s been injured.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: What’s he talking about?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: In college. A car accident.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: Was it serious?</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: He couldn’t play football anymore.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: I assumed because of the train.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You assumed wrong.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: It’s over. You can go now.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I think you skipped a couple steps.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You forgot the “Now I’m going to tell you
what the hell is going on” step. See usually that comes before the,
“It’s over” Step. And it always, always comes before the “You can go”
Step. What is over?</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: The life of an idea that has lived too long
in my head.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: There are probably only four or five
individuals in the world who can claim more knowledge of comics than
myself. I’ve spent a third of my life in a hospital bed with nothing
else to do but read. I have studied the form intimately. I have seen the
patterns in them… The references to social and cultural events and the
atmosphere that surrounded them. I’ve come to believe that comics are
our last link to the ancient way of passing on history.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: The Egyptians drew pictures on walls about
battles, and events. Countries all around the world still pass on
knowledge through pictorial forms. I believe that comics, just at their
core now… have a truth. They are depicting what someone, somewhere felt
or experienced. Then of course that core got chewed up in the commercial
machine and gets jazzed up, made titillating - cartooned for the sale
rack.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: This city has had its share of disasters.
Well publicized ones. It was around the time of that plane crash, when
it first entered my head. And there it stayed, as I waited and watched
the news over the years… And then one day I see a news report on a train
accident and its sole survivor who was miraculously unharmed. And just
like that, an idea blossoms into the flower of possible reality.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What was your idea Elijah?</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: You thought my dad was a real-</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Jeremy don’t take another sip of that
drink.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Throw it in the trashcan near the door and
wait for me outside. Do it now please.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: At the church… You were following me weren’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: Technically no. I gambled that you would
attend the church service. I just waited for you.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What’s this about? This is obviously some
scam. Is this where you tell me one of those pictures is like an
investment?</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: You’ve misunderstood.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I see guys like you all the time in my work.
You find someone you think is emotionally vulnerable and you tell them a
fantastic story, utterly convincing… and somewhere in there, you slip it
in… ‘I just need your credit card number’,‘I just need a small down
payment.’</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Did you know that this morning was the first
morning I can remember, that I didn’t open my eyes and feel that
sadness… Do you know what I’m talking about? That little bit of sadness?
I thought the person that wrote that note had an answer for me. For why
I survived that train. For why my life feels so out of balance… But I
guess that’s what you were counting on.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’m going to leave now. Good luck with your
sale.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: What type of job do you have David?</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: You mentioned you’ve met ‘guys like me’ in
your work. What type of job would that be?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I work at the stadium as a security
guard.</p>
<p><strong>walkie</strong>: Dunne, it’s Jenkins, we got a guy at gate
17C with a bogus ticket. Says he knows you. He won’t tell me his
name.</p>
<p><strong>walkie</strong>: He’s got the most beautiful eyes… The hell
kind of question is that? He’s a guy.</p>
<p><strong>walkie</strong>: Consider him packed. I didn’t like his
attitude… Struttin around with a cane and shit.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: They said I couldn’t get in with my
ticket.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It’s for last week’s game.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: I’ve come to understand that… An ill advised
purchase in the parking lot.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: Not money. But I appreciate your healthy
cynicism in the manner. It will be wise for both of us to proceed with
greatest caution.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: We’re not proceeding anywhere together.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: We’ve already begun.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: One more time. What is it you want?</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: Why is it, do you think, that of all the
professions in the world… you chose protection?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Are you for real?</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: You could have poured coffee in Starbucks,
you could have learned to install track lighting in office buildings,
you could have told people their horoscopes on the internet… You could
have been one of ten thousand things… but in the end, you chose to
protect people. You made that decision… and I find that very, very
interesting. Now all I need is your credit card number.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: That last part was a joke.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I got this job because my college coach
called the guy who manages the stadium. There’s no hidden meaning to
it.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: They need me at the gate.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Did you really want to see the game? I can
get you in.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It gets heaviest ten minutes before
kickoff.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Why don’t we pat down?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Just give me a minute.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: Is there a problem?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: That guy in green. Sometimes people carry
weapons in here. Then they drink too much. They’re team isn’t doing so
well, bad things happen… We do random pat downs of the crowd to
discourage people from carrying. If he’s carrying, he’ll step out of
line.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I got you a seat in the seven hundred level.
It’s nose-bleed territory, but at least you won’t get spit on.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: How did you know that man you bumped was
carrying a weapon?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Probably the army jacket. Those guys carry
hunting knives and stuff for show.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: You thought he was carrying a knife?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I thought he was carrying something.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: But not a knife?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I got this picture of a silver handled gun
tucked in his pants. Like on t.v.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: You have good instincts when it comes to
things like that?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: Telling when people have done something
wrong?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: Have you ever tried to develop it?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I don’t know what you’re asking?</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: You’re skill.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Listen. I got to be on the sidelines during
the game… You can get to your seat by taking the stairwell at-</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: Characters in comic books are often
attributed special powers. X-ray vision, things of that sort.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Okay, I don’t want to play this game
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: It’s an exaggeration of the truth. Maybe
it’s based on something as simple as instinct. Like being able to touch
someone and tell whether they’ve done something wrong… Or the level of
what they’ve done wrong.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: The guy might not have been carrying
anything.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: Or he might have been carrying a silver
handled gun tucked in his pants.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I have to go now.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: One last question.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Quick.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: The car accident you were in… Was there
anyone else involved?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Yes. My wife Megan. She was in the car with
me.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Have a good life Elijah and try to buy your
tickets at an authorized sales location.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: Was it sold out?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You know how mad your mom would be if she
knew you were playing football?</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: Are you going to tell?</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: You want yo play the last downs? We got a
big guy like you. You can play on opposite sides.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: He’s Potter’s cousin. He’s the starting
corner back for Temple University.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: He going pro in the draft. They say he can
run the fifty-</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: In under six seconds. I’ve heard.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’m going to go in.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: Just play one set of downs. I told them you
were great.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Why’d you do that?</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: Just one-</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Jeremy. I’m going in. I have to do some
things.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: What things?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’m going to work out.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: I’ll help you.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: There’s nothing to do.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Why don’t you rest now? I’ll take it from
here. You’ve been a big help.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: You think you could beat up Mike Tyson? I
mean before he started wiggin out and eating people’s ears?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: What if you worked out everyday for six
months? You think you could beat him then?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: What if you only ate foods that were good
for you and you worked out everyday for a year?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: How much did you put on there?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You put too much. That’s two hundred and
fifty pounds.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: How much can you lift?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: That’s the most I’ve ever lifted. That could
have been dangerous Jeremy. Why don’t you go upstairs and let me finish
up?</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: I’ll take it off. I’ll help you right.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: You think you could have beaten up Bruce
Lee?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: I mean if you knew karate?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: No Jeremy.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: What if he wasn’t aloud to kick and you were
really mad at him?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: How much did you take off?</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: I lied.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You added?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Why don’t you move back a bit? Just to be
safe.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: More?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You should never try anything like this. You
know that right?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What do you do if something happens?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: How many did you put on that time?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: There’s no more left?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What else can we use?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Yeah, hello.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Megan?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Yeah? Megan where are you calling from?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I remember you.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Yeah it might be nice.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: …When you work with clients on machines, do
they sometimes just jump up a level or two? Do something they didn’t
know they were capable of?</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Not often, but it is possible. Most people
get scared when they see the shadow of their limits. They don’t know how
long the shadow really is. They don’t know how far away the real limits
are standing… They stop out of fear.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: This is kind of strange isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: We’re not even acting like ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Like that. Your mouth’s dirty. You tapped
your napkin to your lips. You only do that when you’re with someone you
don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What do I do when I’m around someone I
know?</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: You use your sleeve.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: I thought it was you.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Hi. This is Claire. Her son is in Jeremy’s
class. Claire and I worked on the school food drive together.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I’m very happy about this. Megan mentioned
to me she was considering dating again.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: David.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: David?</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: This is my husband.</p>
<p><strong>dyed hair girl</strong>: He ate about six of those chocolate
covered doughnut holes with his milk. He said he only had three, but I
know he had six.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>dyed hair girl</strong>: My parents sleep in separate
beds.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>dyed hair girl</strong>: By the way, Jeremy went to sleep in
his room tonight.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: His room?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Jeremy.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: They call me Mr. Glass.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: Kids.</p>
<p><strong>janis</strong>: Your ten o’clock is here. The hospital
discharged him this morning.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Elijah right?</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: We’re going to prevent any substantial
atrophy of your good leg with this. It works the quadriceps.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: How long have you been married?</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Twelve years.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: How did you get together?</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: A car accident.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: Now you’re going to have to tell me
more.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: …See my husband was a big football star in
college and we were in an accident together. Our car flipped on an icy
road. We were both injured. He couldn’t play football anymore. If that
hadn’t happened, we wouldn’t have been together.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: How so?</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Football wasn’t the kind of life I wanted…
For ten years I’d be by the phone waiting for a call telling me he broke
his neck in a practice game. And if it wasn’t that call, it would be a
call telling me he blew out his knee or suffered his third concussion.
I’ve seen way too much of it in my job… I can barely take it when my
clients are in pain. I don’t hate the game. I admire the amount of skill
it involved and, like everyone else, I was in awe of how he could play
it, but I couldn’t give him my heart and then have something happen to
him. And it always does with that game. It’s not a thing many people
would understand.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: You and my mother would have a special
connection.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Any way, fate stepped in and took football
out of the equation.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: …And everyone lived happily ever after.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Sort of.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: What part of David’s body was injured?</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Who said my husband’s name is David?</p>
<p><strong>stocky woman</strong>: Choose.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: There have been three major disasters in
this city over the last four years. I’ve followed each one of them… A
Seven-three-seven crashes on take off. One hundred and seventy-two die.
No survivors… A hotel fire downtown. Two hundred and eleven die. No
survivors… And am Amtrak train derails seven and half miles outside of
the city. One hundred and thirty one die. One survivor. He is unharmed.
I’ve spoken with your husband about his survival. I suggested a rather
unbelievable explanation. Since then, I’ve come to believe, that my
explanation, however unbelievable, is in fact, true.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: And what was that explanation?</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: It’s a mediocre time Mrs. Dunne. People are
starting to lose hope. It’s hard for many to believe that extraordinary
things live inside themselves as well as others… I hope you can keep an
open mind?</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: I own a comic book museum. It’s called the
Limited Edition.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: I believe comic books are based loosely on
reality - I believe there are real life equivalents of the heroes in
those books that walk the earth - I believe your husband is one of those
individuals.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: I’m glad you brought up fate Mrs. Dunne. I’m
becoming a strong believer in it… See, David refuses to speak with me
any longer… And when I saw your name on my insurance list of approved
physical therapists… It was like fate had intervened… We were meant to
speak to each other.</p>
<p><strong>gray eyed man</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: We’ve had some problems with drug selling in
this stadium. Would you mind if I checked the pockets of your
sweatshirt?</p>
<p><strong>gray eyed man</strong>: Why don’t you go take care of your
business?</p>
<p><strong>gray eyed man</strong>: And dude, no one carries their
merchandise on them any more. They got messengers for that shit now.
That’s what they tell me.</p>
<p><strong>thermometer boy</strong>: Is that your dad?</p>
<p><strong>thermometer boy</strong>: I bet my dad can beat up you
dad.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: …No, he insisted we only call you. Though it
took us a while to track down your number. It’s not on file here.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Megan handles that type of stuff.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: What stuff is that?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Jeremy’s stuff.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: So do I need to put any smelly ointments on
him or anything?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: It’s more emotional damage. It wasn’t very
serious physically.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Nothing like when I sent you to the
hospital.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: My office was on the other side of the
building back then. You don’t remember me do you?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: I had red hair.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: I think you were a little younger than Jeremy
when it happened. Did you know we changed the conduct rules of the pool
because of you?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: The kids still talk about it like some ghost
story…“Did you know there was a kid that almost drowned in the pool? He
got pneumonia and almost died.”</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: We let them tell it… It helps keep them
safe.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Are you still phobic of water?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Yes I am.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You are like me. We both can get hurt. I’m
just an ordinary man. I’m not what you think I am.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: Why do you keep saying that?</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: He’s just laying in bed. He’s pretty upset.
He won’t talk.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: He’s dealing with a lot of things. I think he
needs to find answers himself.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: It’s weird to hear you tell me about Jeremy.
A good weird.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Would you like to try going-</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: -out again.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: But if we see another mother from Jeremy’s
school, me name is Juan. I always wanted to be a Juan.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Oh. Elijah Price came to visit me at the
center today.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: He didn’t do anything. He just told me his
theory… It’s sad when patients get like that. They loose reality.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: -Jeremy did you load that gun?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: -Elijah was wrong.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: -Sometimes when people are sick or hurt for a
long time, like Elijah, they’re mind gets hurt too.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: -They start to think things that aren’t true.
He hold me what he thought about your father. It isn’t true.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: -You know the story about the kid who almost
drowned in the pool?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: -That was me they were talking about. I
almost died. That was me.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: -I’m not. I just didn’t connect it.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: -Jeremy, your father was injured in college -
you know that. You know all about that.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: -Don’t do it. He’ll die Jeremy.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: -Jeremy listen to what-</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: -Don’t be scared.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: -Jeremy if you pull that trigger I’m going to
leave! I’m going to go to New York.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You’re right… If you shoot me, that bullet is
going to bounce off me and I won’t get hurt… but then I’m going to go
upstairs and pack. And then leave to New York.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: Joined a rugby league. Turned out to be a
bad idea. Come here I want to show you something.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: Look at this. I just noticed this today.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: This is from the Sentryman series. A color
version of this was actually used in the second issue.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: Look at this eyes. What do you see?</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: It’s fear. He was scared. They were being
honest in the beginning you see. They let him be human. They turned him
into a garden variety hero later… Then he was brave all the time.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: I followed the guy in the army jacket.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: He had a silver handled gun tucked in the
back of his pants. Were you really injured in that car accident in
college?</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: Because I think you faked it. I think you
took the opportunity to end your career - no questions asked. And I
think you did it, of all things, for a women… Not only do you have the
physical traits of a hero, down somewhere in there, you have the moral
code of one too. You were ready to sacrifice everything for what’s
right. Where can you find that these days? Only thing you didn’t realize
is that you were giving up a part of yourself when you gave up football.
The physical part. And you need that part desperately to feel balance
again… You can have it back now. This was all just make believe before.
What if there was someone the opposite of me? What if?… I now believe
you are the genuine article Mr. David Dunne. The kind of person we knew
existed, from our history.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: It’s time for someone like you. Bad is
winning. I can feel it.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: That’s not what I witnessed David.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Stop messing with my life Elijah. My son
almost shot me last night. He wanted to prove you were right.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: I never said you couldn’t be killed. I never
said that.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You have a problem, Elijah. My wife is right.
Somewhere along the line one of your bones broke and your mind just
broke with it.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: Are you finished?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: No. And I have been sick. I spent a week in a
hospital when I was a boy recovering from pneumonia and almost
drowning.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Two skinny eight year old kids were playing
around the pool. They were dunking me. I swallowed water. They didn’t
know it and they almost killed me. Heroes don’t get killed like that.
Normal people do.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I don’t want to see you again okay. Now I’m
finished.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: The sitter’s here.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: We can do this another time if you want? I’m
fine with anything.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: But I put cologne on.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Is that what that smell is?</p>
<p><strong>ponytail man</strong>: Hey man it’s twenty after. It’s time
to close. I gotta head.</p>
<p><strong>ponytail man</strong>: You better not be jacking off to the
Japanese comics. I swear to God.</p>
<p><strong>ponytail man</strong>: Listen man, I didn’t know you were in-
Just choose something all right?</p>
<p><strong>ponytail man</strong>: Hello. You understand English?</p>
<p><strong>ponytail man</strong>: Look man, I’m just gonna wheel you
out. You can think about things outside on the sidewalk. I gotta get
some chicken in me, you know what I’m saying?</p>
<p><strong>ponytail man</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>ponytail man</strong>: Dude, I don’t care if you are in a
wheelchair. If you do that again, I’m calling Five-O.</p>
<p><strong>ponytail man</strong>: That’s it crackerjack! You’re going to
sit your ass in jail now.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: How much is this one?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: …I think rust.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Rust?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: As a color, not as rust. You know, a rust
colored paint or wood?</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: I didn’t know that. Mine’s still brown.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: My turn. What’s your favorite song?</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Soft and Wet, by the Artist Formerly Known as
Prince.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: We’re supposed to be honest.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Soft and Wet. That’s very interesting.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: My turn. When was the first time the thought
popped into your head that we might not make it?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: That’s not the game.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: It’s a second date. There aren’t any
rules.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’m not sure.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Think carefully?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What about the game?</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: It’s finished. I won.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Maybe it wasn’t a specific moment, maybe
it-</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I had a nightmare one night and I didn’t wake
you up so you could tell me it was okay. I think that was the first
time. Does that count?</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Do you knowingly keep Jeremy and me at a
distance?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I don’t know Megan.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: It’s like you resent us David. Resent the
life you have.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: You know even if it meant we couldn’t be
together, I would never have wished that injury on you? What you could
so physically was a gift. I would never have wished it to go away.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: You know that right?</p>
<p><strong>dyed hair girl</strong>: You got two calls. One came through
while I was on the line - I wasn’t talking too long. There was an
emergency with my sister. She tried to do her own perm and now she looks
like-</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Who called through?</p>
<p><strong>dyed hair girl</strong>: Someone from New York.</p>
<p><strong>dyed hair girl</strong>: About a security job at a museum.
They want to hire you. I didn’t know you guys were moving to New York.
Thanks for telling me.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: We’re not moving.</p>
<p><strong>dyed hair girl</strong>: Oh. I let the answering machine pick
up the other call.</p>
<p><strong>dyed hair girl</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Look let’s be honest here. We’re just at the
beginning. I don’t expect you or I to change the course of where our
lives were headed because of two dates. If you do go to New York, we can
still develop this. We’ll just be forced to take it slow. And in the
end, that’s definitely better. This is our second time around David. I
don’t expect us to get carried away. I guess congratulations is the
right thing to say.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: The point of all this is, we now know
something we didn’t… You have a weakness… Water. It’s your krpytonite.
You hearing me David? Call me back… I got rugby practice in an hour.</p>
<p><strong>machine</strong>: Message erased.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Megan…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Megan?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Me too.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Is she all right?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I think her leg is fractured.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Are you injured?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Hold on. I got a C.B. in the truck.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>david’s voice</strong>: Elijah?</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: David?</p>
<p><strong>david’s voice</strong>: What am I supposed to do?</p>
<p><strong>slicked hair man</strong>: Go back to Africa!</p>
<p><strong>teenager</strong>: What’s your name? I think you drank too
much.</p>
<p><strong>glassy eyed man</strong>: Can I come in?</p>
<p><strong>man in house</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>glassy eyed man</strong>: I like your house. Can I come
in?</p>
<p><strong>man in house</strong>: What is this? No you can’t come
in.</p>
<p><strong>glassy eyed man</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>man in house</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You need to leave now.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: …See the villain’s eyes. They’re larger than
the other characters’. They insinuate a slightly skewed perspective of
how they see the world. Just off normal.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: He doesn’t look very threatening.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: That’s what I said to my son. He said,
there’s always two kinds. The soldier villain who fights the hero with
his hands, and then there’s the real threat. The brilliant and evil arch
enemy who fights the hero with his mind.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Are you Elijah’s mother?</p>
<p><strong>elijah’s mother</strong>: I am. I’m helping him with the
sale.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m David
Dunne.</p>
<p><strong>elijah’s mother</strong>: He’s spoken of you. He says you’re
becoming friends.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: We are.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: He’s doing well today.</p>
<p><strong>elijah’s mother</strong>: I’m very proud of him. He’s been
through a lot in his life. A lot of ups and downs, a lot of bad spells.
A couple I’d thought had broken him… I mean emotionally. They were bad…
But he made it. Yes he did.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: He’s kind of a miracle.</p>
<p><strong>elijah’s mother</strong>: Yes he is.</p>
<p><strong>elijah’s mother</strong>: I’ll tell him you’re here.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: Did you see this?</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: When I saw it this morning. I felt a part of
the world again.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: A plane just crashed.</p>
<p><strong>elderly man</strong>: I’ve worked here twenty-five years. I
know all its secrets.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: Secrets?</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: Passengers aren’t allowed in there.</p>
