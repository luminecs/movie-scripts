<p><strong>early draft</strong>: February 28, 2003</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Sir. Sir, may I have a ticket to Montreal
please?</p>
<p><strong>cashier</strong>: Pardon?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I need a ticket to Montreal.</p>
<p><strong>cashier</strong>: Montreal?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Yes, sir. Please.</p>
<p><strong>cashier</strong>: Forty-three dollars.</p>
<p><strong>int. bus - day</strong>: A half dozen PASSENGERS. Martin
steps aboard, takes a seat. DAN SOULSBY, Martin’s age, sits next to him,
offers a hand. Martin shakes.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Dan Soulsby.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Martin. Nice to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Where you heading to?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Away from here.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Pisswater.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: At least it’s cold pisswater. Here’s to getting
away.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: That was bad. It’s gonna take all day to get
another bus here.</p>
<p><strong>what martin sees</strong>: A car rental place.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: Martin fingers the envelope of cash
in his pocket.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: You have a license?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Had one. They took it away.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I got one. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>int. rental car - moving - night</strong>: Dan drives.
JOURNEY ON the RADIO. Martin checks out Dan’s guitar. Dan shows Martin
his teeth.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: See that? They’re all fake.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: You take a hockey puck in the face?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: A fist. My stepdad socked me. I flew across the
room and dented the sheetrock in the kitchen. My mom saw everything and
still took his side.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: You got cracked good.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I hate that guy. Two hundred pounds of
worthless grease.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Why’d he hit you?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I wrecked his sixty-five Mustang and his boat
in the same week. His babies. I totaled them.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I would have popped you too.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: It was worth it. But I didn’t deserve the tour
in hell.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Don’t ever go to military school if you can
help it. It sucks. I jumped the wall two days ago.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: You going back?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I’m done with that racket. I’m going to Seattle
and playing music.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I know some chords.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Think you can learn drums?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I’m the next Billy Squire. Krokus will be
opening for me one day.</p>
<p><strong>ext. highway - day</strong>: The middle of nowhere. Martin
flips a coin. Heads.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>the grill of the pickup</strong>: WHAM! It plasters Dan. He
goes over the hood, SHATTERS the front WINDSHIELD. Bounces off, spins
like a rag doll into a ditch. The pickup has lost control, it rolls.
Several times, a heaving mass of steel. CRASH! The TRUCK folds itself
around a husky tree. No survivors, that’s clear.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: He can’t believe what he has just done. He
takes in the carnage, tugs at his ear.</p>
<p><strong>superimpose: present day</strong>: ESTABLISHING the
river-bound city. Beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>ext. ferry pier - day</strong>: The signs in French. Crowded
with PASSENGERS waiting to board. As more PASSENGERS pour off the
just-docked ship. A WOMAN runs through the crowd. Terror etched in her
face. She knocks aside several PEOPLE. Runs toward a row of restaurants.
Even in her turmoil, she is patrician, elegant.</p>
<p><strong>ext. pier-side cafe - day</strong>: Two BEAT COPS eat at an
outdoor table. Laid back. The WOMAN approaches them, frantic.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: I just saw my dead son get off the ferry.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Listen to me; he’s been dead eighteen years.
He just walked right past me.</p>
<p><strong>int. montreal pd office - day</strong>: An INSPECTOR pours
the Woman tea. She has calmed down. He takes his pen, looking at her
statement.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: You need to open that grave. It can’t be my
son in there.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: I lost my mother two years ago. Every day
I think I see her. Driving to work in the car next to me. At mass.
Shopping, I see her, but this is someone else’s mother. You see?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Inspector, I’m saddened by your loss and
touched by loyalty. But let’s focus on the matter at hand. He walked
right past me. We made eye contact. I know he recognized me. It was my
son. A mother knows these things. I will sign anything, I will swear
before a judge. And thank you, I do have all my faculties and friends
who can vouch for my character.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: Did you talk to this man, he is a man
now?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Yes. Of course he’s a man. He’d be
thirty-two. And no, I did not speak with him. I ran. Inspector, my son
was very, very disturbed. He had serious emotional problems. I assure
you he was. Is. Is a dangerous person.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: Madame. The police department cannot
resolve your problem. You need to get permits from the coroner and
health and safety department. You pay for an exhumation. You have
someone qualified examine the remains. If it is the wrong body, the
Forensic Examiner will confirm there is a problem and call us. Then we
open an investigation. No, Quebec City police will investigate. He is
buried there, no?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: No. Inspector. He is not.</p>
<p><strong>worker</strong>: Someone call the cops.</p>
<p><strong>int. task force room - night</strong>: INSPECTOR LAVAL and
INSPECTOR REYNAUD, rock solid French Canadians, pin photographs of the
body we just saw on the wall. Laval steps back. Takes in the
display.</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: Think she will like this?</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: We are lucky the FBI is sending
her. She is the Michael Jordan of criminal profiling. The Guy Le Fleuer
of profiling. She will save our ass.</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: Inspector Laval. Have the airline
check again. Look around baggage claim. She was on the flight but they
can’t find her.</p>
<p><strong>inspector reynaud</strong>: Oui?</p>
<p><strong>inspector reynaud</strong>: I know where she is.</p>
<p><strong>darkness</strong>: We hear BREATHING and the SOFT RUSH of a
RIVER. Soft, rhythmic. Then FOOTSTEPS. Two eyes open, reflect moonlight.
The FOOTSTEPS drawing closer. CLICK! A FLASHLIGHT turns on.
REVEALING:</p>
<p><strong>ext. forest construction site - night</strong>: GRACE
VANDERHOLT lies in the grave where the body was discovered. It has been
excavated by criminologists, the soil sifted, the grass and brush
removed. Grace sits up. Grace holds out her FBI creds, shielding her
eyes from the bright light.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: It’s okay, I’m supposed to be here.</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: Agent Vanderholt, we requested your
help. I’m Inspector Laval, this is Inspector Reynaud.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Hi. Look, I’m not ready to talk to you guys
yet. I need a little more time here.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Would you mind trading one liners somewhere
else? I need to hear the natural sounds. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><strong>on grace</strong>: She steps out of the grave. Sits by it.
Writes some notes. Everything glistens in the moonlight, alive. Grace
takes it in for a beat. Then: HOWLING, the lonely song of a distant
WOLF. Grace rises, crosses to the river, to a big gravel bar. Used as a
campsite complete with a large fire pit. Grace sits by the fire pit.
More HOWLING, CLOSER this time. Grace looks down river, SEES the glowing
eyes of a TIMBER WOLF staring from a clump of trees. The animal stares a
beat, then runs off. Grace has the chills. Grace walks quietly toward
the trees. Grace just a few feet away. RUSTLING. She cautiously moves
aside a sapling.</p>
<p><strong>ext. riverbank - grace’s flashlight - night</strong>: A
TIMBER WOLF nestled amidst the trees gnaws on something; a HUMAN
HEAD.</p>
<p><strong>ext. riverbank - night</strong>: Grace stands there alone,
the wolf is long gone. She stoops, pushes aside brush. She finds a
hollow under some roots. Grace CLICKS on her FLASHLIGHT.</p>
<p><strong>what she sees</strong>: A human skull stares up from the
hollow. Picked clean, weathered.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Don’t shoot, I’m on your team.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Call who you have to call. I found his
head.</p>
<p><strong>int. autopsy room - day</strong>: Gloved hands carefully
remove the skull from a box. The MEDICAL EXAMINER places the skull on an
exam table and begins cleaning it. Grace walks around the headless body.
The wetsuit has been removed, the body has been autopsied. Headless,
skeletal hands, the legs are surprisingly well-preserved. DIRECTOR
GILLET is tall, heavy, smoking a cigar. He’s a cop’s cop and all-around
nice guy.</p>
<p><strong>director gillet</strong>: I can’t tell you how excited we are
to have you here.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You only have one victim. Usually there’s two
or three by the time I get called in.</p>
<p><strong>director gillet</strong>: This case made page one of the
Globe. The tabloids say there is a headhunter on the loose.</p>
<p><strong>director gillet</strong>: The Mayor wants closure. That’s his
vacation house they were building. I get calls from supervisors I didn’t
know I had.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You clear the Mayor?</p>
<p><strong>director gillet</strong>: We cleared the Mayor. He read the
article on you in Newsweek and insisted we fly you up. The papers say
two campers had a drunken fight and the loser lost his head.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>director gillet</strong>: I don’t solve crimes anymore, I
balance budgets.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: This was not a heat of the moment killing.
And the victim was buried complete with head. The grave was five-foot
ten. The victim’s height. With square corners. Dug with a shovel the
killer had the foresight to bring.</p>
<p><strong>director gillet</strong>: Thirty-five detectives searched the
area Saturday. My investigators think you’re a witch.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I’ve been called worse.</p>
<p><strong>director gillet</strong>: Jeez. Look at that, looks like he
got ice-picked.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: No. A large canine did that. Probably an old
or sick timber wolf that couldn’t hunt. It dug up the body and chewed
off the head. It felt safe in the trees, away from the riverbank, away
from the other wolves.</p>
<p><strong>medical examiner</strong>: I’d say you’re right. Postmortem
scavenger damage to C-1.</p>
<p><strong>medical examiner</strong>: The victim was afraid of dentists.
Bad teeth.</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: This was a meter from the skull. At
soil level.</p>
<p><strong>medical examiner</strong>: Look at this.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Bingo. That’s your murder weapon.</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: It might be trash a camper
left.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: No. Look at it, braided parachute cord, two
pieces of broom stick. You approach the victim from behind, loop it
around his head and hold on for all your might. The more the victim
struggles, the quicker he passes out. And now you have convenient
handles to drag around two hundred pounds of dead kayaker.</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: That is a theory.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: That’s exactly what it is. A theory. That
evidence supports. When the suspect is in custody you can ask him
yourself what happened and you won’t need me. Inspector.</p>
<p><strong>director gillet</strong>: Laval and Reynaud are my stars.
Very smart, very persistent investigators. On the street; they’re
magnificent.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I can see that Director. You’re lucky to have
them.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Go ahead, Director, say what you have to
say.</p>
<p><strong>director gillet</strong>: You’re the expert. If you have any
suggestions on how to proceed…</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Sure. A forensic anthropologist can draw the
victim’s face based on the skull. I know someone at Quantico who can do
it by tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>director gillet</strong>: We have people.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Call ’em. Then show the results to everybody
around who was selling outdoor goods two years ago. You have his
initials; MRC, inside the wetsuit. The long hair is distinctive, someone
may recognize him. It’s a semi-long shot.</p>
<p><strong>director gillet</strong>: No, that’s bread and butter
detective work. Thank you. We should get upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>int. task force room - day</strong>: Photos, maps, newspaper
articles cover the walls. Twenty-four Hour News ON a TV. Six DETECTIVES
man the phones. ROOKIES fetch reports, pour coffee.</p>
<p><strong>int. conference room - day</strong>: The long table is
crowded. Inspectors Laval and Reynaud. Three more POLICE OFFICIALS. A
pair of CITY COUNCILMEN. Grace sits next to Gillet.</p>
<p><strong>councilman #1</strong>: You found the skull. Incredible.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I had a case once where wild dogs had removed
remains.</p>
<p><strong>councilman #2</strong>: So I can tell my people there isn’t a
headhunter running around the wilds of Quebec?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: No headhunters, sir. However, a killer is out
there.</p>
<p><strong>councilman #1</strong>: Director Gillet. Do you have the
victim identified?</p>
<p><strong>director gillet</strong>: No name yet, sir. We have someone
from the University recreating his face from the skull.</p>
<p><strong>councilman #1</strong>: Why, after two years, has nobody
reported him missing?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: He wasn’t missed. He had no family, or moved
often. He had the musculature of a serious outdoorsman. He spent a lot
of time in his kayak.</p>
<p><strong>councilman #1</strong>: The big question is who killed
him.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Always is, sir. I can give you a rough
profile; white male, thirty to thirty-four. Has some college but no
degree. Neat in appearance. At least six feet tall. Very intelligent.
Charming when necessary. He uses murder as a tool, probably in
furtherance of a criminal endeavor. He’s killed before and will again
unless caught.</p>
<p><strong>councilman #1</strong>: We really appreciate the FBI sending
you. When can we expect your report?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: A couple days, sir.</p>
<p><strong>int. task force room - day</strong>: Grace writes notes on a
yellow pad. Inspectors Laval and Reynaud cross, Laval shows her an
artist’s sketch of the victim.</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: Say hello to a dead man.</p>
<p><strong>insert sketch</strong>: The victim has a deep stare, rugged
features, long hair.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Shame. Good-looking guy.</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: This is more than we had. Thank
you.</p>
<p><strong>int. hotel room - night</strong>: A very nice bed and
breakfast. Grace enters and finds her luggage waiting. She loves the
room. Antiques, art. Grace finds a bottle of wine and a note from
Gillet. She smiles. Grace checks the mini fridge; bingo. Cracks a
Moosehead. Her CELL RINGS.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Vanderholt?</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: We named the victim; Curtis Kohler.
The forensic dentist just verified the ID.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: With a C?</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: No. K-O-H-L-E-R. The initials are
for the Montreal River Company. Kohler worked there as a guide three
years ago. The owner remembers him because he stole the wetsuit.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Can you do a full records search? Criminal,
credit, commercial history. Transcripts. Everything.</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: Yes, of course.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You’re an awesome investigator, Inspector.
Run his name on every database you can. I’ll see you in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>int. task force room - day</strong>: Grace, Reynaud and Laval
look through a haystack of computer printouts for needles of
information. Grace stretches. Grabs a donut from a box. Offers the box
to Laval.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Fruit of the Gods. You know you want one.</p>
<p><strong>inspector reynaud</strong>: Let’s take her down the street. I
will not eat one of those hockey pucks.</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: Let’s go down the street. Very good
food. We are inviting you. Please.</p>
<p><strong>int. bistro - day</strong>: Locals only. The Inspector’s
favorite spot, they are like family here. Grace, Laval and Reynaud at a
table in back. Covered with reports and plates. Grace stops reading.
Tosses aside a printout.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Mr. Kohler has been dead two years. No doubt
about that. Right?</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: Very solid time of death. Two years
ago.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: So before he died he got his paychecks, paid
his taxes. Patronized sporting goods stores. And had long spending gaps
where he was enjoying the great outdoors. That pattern continues a year
after his death. He gets some paychecks. Rents an apartment. Buys a
three thousand dollar kayak. Pays his taxes. Dead and buried and still
paying his taxes. Then everything stops. Last Visa charge was to
Travelocity for a plane ticket to Mexico city.</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: Dead men don’t pay their bills.
It’s identity theft.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: This isn’t someone renting limos and fancy
dinners on someone else’s credit. Lifestyle and habits don’t change.</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: Computer error?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Too many independent systems.</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: We work organized crime sometimes,
maybe a hit man wanted to lay low. He assumed the life of a civilian
until things cooled off.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You really think a gangster is going to break
his stride and become a long hair groovy river guide? Inspector, this
guy’s whole life has been stolen. Someone killed him and became him.
Down to profession and taste in clothing.</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: You are a heavy sleeper.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You’re everywhere. What’s up, Laval?</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: A man was killed tonight. Attacked
from behind. Asphyxiated with a nylon cord with handles. And there’s a
witness. Or a suspect. We’re not sure yet. We should go.</p>
<p><strong>night</strong>: Cop cars everywhere. Crime scene tape. The
Coroner’s van. A couple NEWS CAMERAMEN. Grace crossing with Laval.
Reynaud places a HANDCUFFED MAN in workout gear in the back of a cop
car.</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: That’s him. He says he saw the
killer.</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: Meet Mr. Todd Ford.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: He’s still warm.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Want to get those?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Where is it?</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: There. Under his car.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Holy shit. Has Le Directeur been
notified?</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: I’m letting the poor man sleep a
couple more minutes. Twenty-four hour gym is there, next door. He has a
membership card in his wallet. That’s his car. Car keys.</p>
<p><strong>int. inspector’s offices - night</strong>: Director Gillet
sips bad coffee in a rumpled suit and T- shirt. Looking through a
two-way mirror. Grace, Reynaud are with him.</p>
<p><strong>director gillet</strong>: Is that our killer?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Maybe. So far he checks out as an art dealer
from Winnipeg.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: I walk out of the gym. Walk to my car. I’m
unlocking it and I hear a scuffle, a fight. Over by this car I see this
guy getting choked from behind and I shouted.</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: What did you shout?</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: ‘Stop.’ I ran towards them. Then the person
doing the choking lets go and pointed a gun at me and ran. I’m so
stupid. I could of been shot. I called the police gave him CPR until the
paramedics came.</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: You touched him?</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Of course. I was giving him CPR.</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: You removed the Garrote?</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: The thing around his neck? Yes. I took it
off, it was choking him.</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: Did you see where the attacker
went?</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Away from me.</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: What kind of gun did he have?</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: The kind that puts really big holes in
people.</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: Was it black? Was it silver?</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Black.</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: Okay, see? I am getting
information. He had a large black handgun.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Listen to me. I can draw a picture of his
face. I saw him.</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: You want to draw a picture?</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: A sketch. I can sketch him. I’m very
good.</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: How could you see his face in the
dark?</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: I did not do this. I saw two guys fighting
and should of ran the other way but I didn’t. You need to find the
person who killed this man. You need to find the guy who did this.</p>
<p><strong>int. inspector’s offices - night</strong>: Grace doesn’t like
the turn.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You need to confirm he’s a suspect or clear
him and kick-start a manhunt based on Costa’s ID. If he is a legit
witness, he’ll get heated up and start forgetting details. I think
there’s a way to clear him without pissing him off. May I?</p>
<p><strong>director gillet</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Inspector. I need a moment with you.</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: I was getting into his mind.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I have a shortcut. Can you get any of his
school transcripts?</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: Sure. It’s all on-line.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Call the Winnipeg Police and have them fax or
e-mail his driver’s license photo.</p>
<p><strong>int. interrogation room - night</strong>: John Costa smiles
at Grace as she enters. Sets her bag on the floor. The case file on the
desk.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: I hope you guys are playing bad cop smart
cop.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Sorry. I’m the dumb one. Agent Vanderholt.
Call me Grace.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Thank you. He had these real intense
eyes.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Hold on. Before you do that, I need some
personal information from you. Can you write down the name of the
elementary school you attended? And your elementary school teachers, as
many as you can remember.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Are you kidding me? Lady, I saw someone get
killed tonight and you’re asking me about grade school?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I apologize, I know it’s random, but it’s the
best way you can help me.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: I don’t remember any of that.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Please, Mr. Costa. You’d be surprised.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: I attended two. Holy Trinity and Mother of
Good Counsel. I remember Sister Bernard. And. I don’t know, Father
Jeffrey. Mr. Johansen. Oh, and Mrs. Sebastien, she had a glass eye.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: May I?</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Omigod. That’s it, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: That’s what?</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: The thing around his neck.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: I told the other guy, I’ll tell you. I did
not do this. Grace. I saw who did this and I can show you what he looks
like and you can go catch him.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Go ahead and draw the face of the man you
saw.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: We’ll get an artist to help you.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: I can draw him, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>int. inspector’s offices - night</strong>: Grace emerges from
the interrogation room. Reynaud hands her a printout of Costa’s school
records. Grace checking Costa’s list against his transcripts.</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: You left a file in there.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I know. See if he tries to peek in it. The
real killer couldn’t resist. He’ll want to know what we know.</p>
<p><strong>int. interrogation room - night</strong>: Costa draws with
skilled hands, delicate but strong. The file is ignored.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Can you remember any of your grade school
teachers? He remembered three.</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: Here’s his provincial driver’s
license photo. He’s checking out.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Have a nurse take a DNA sample. Just to make
sure his DNA isn’t in the victim’s car or anything weird.</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: We’ll run the tests.</p>
<p><strong>int. interrogation room - night</strong>: Costa has finished
the sketch. He holds it up to the mirror, for those he assumes are
watching. REFLECTED in the two-way mirror is COSTA’S SKETCH. Cold
piercing eyes, chiseled features. The door opens, expecting Grace, Costa
is disappointed to see a tough-looking PARAMEDIC unwrapping a cotton
swab.</p>
<p><strong>paramedic</strong>: Please open your mouth.</p>
<p><strong>int. patrol car - moving - day</strong>: THE SKETCH is taped
to the dashboard, now labeled: UNKNOWN ASSAILANT. The cops cruise the
business district, eyeballing the arriving OFFICE WORKERS.</p>
<p><strong>ext. coffee stand - day</strong>: GRACE slams an espresso
shot as she reads the Globe.</p>
<p><strong>medical examiner</strong>: Fell out of his T-shirt when I
removed the clothing. It doesn’t fit the victim.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: WVSS. 1995. What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>medical examiner</strong>: West Vancouver Secondary School
Class of ’95.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: CWE? Whose initials? Not the victim’s.</p>
<p><strong>medical examiner</strong>: No. I called the school and had
someone find them in a yearbook. Here’s the original owner’s name. But
it could have been through a dozen pawn shops since then.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Doctor, can I take you back to Quantico with
me?</p>
<p><strong>medical examiner</strong>: Sorry. I must remain where the
hockey is good.</p>
<p><strong>ext. medical examiner’s offices - day</strong>: Reynaud and
Grace crossing through the parking lot.</p>
<p><strong>inspector reynaud</strong>: This is Special Unit Fourteen. I
want a complete name search. Clark William. Surname is Edwards.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Inspector Reynaud. Can we swing by the crime
scene before we head back?</p>
<p><strong>ext. parking lot crime scene - day</strong>: Tape still up.
The 24 Hour gym is closed for the day. Grace looking around. Laval
studies a shrine of candles on the sidewalk. Grace sneaks up on him. She
gets real close. Laval watches the candles burn.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Inspector.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: C’mere a second, please.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Borrow your keys? Stand there like you’re
going to choke me.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Keys drop straight down, how’d they end up
over there under that car?</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: They were kicked. During the
struggle.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Okay. Kick them as hard as you can that
way.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Not even halfway.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I had this case. This young hundred-pound
woman was abducted from a parking lot. She kicked off a mirror, broke a
window, dented her door. She struggled. This guy? Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: Everything you are saying, you are
saying one thing, do we trust Costa?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Good question. Do we trust Costa?</p>
<p><strong>inspector reynaud</strong>: Get in.</p>
<p><strong>int. unmarked car - moving - day</strong>: Grace and Laval
get in, Reynaud guns it. Grace belts in.</p>
<p><strong>inspector reynaud</strong>: I found a current address here in
Montreal.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You guys have an extra weapon? I didn’t want
to cross the border armed.</p>
<p><strong>inspector reynaud</strong>: The glove box.</p>
<p><strong>super</strong>: I never met him. We conducted our business by
phone.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I smell smoke. Back where I’m from anyone can
kick a door if there’s a fire. It’s the ‘citizen’s arrest’ of search
warrants.</p>
<p><strong>int. apartment - day</strong>: It’s dark, drawn shades. A
small studio. Reynaud and Grace move tactically with drawn guns. Grace
enters the kitchen. Light smoke. Reynaud approaches the futon, a
person-sized shape under the blankets. Reynaud whips aside the blanket.
Just pillows. Grace checks under the sink. Reynaud checks the bathroom
and shower. A coffee pot smokes, SIZZLING sludge on the bottom. Grace
checks around the fridge, now satisfied no one lurks in there.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Clear.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Ugh. Got a lung full.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Looks like this guy ran out in the middle of
breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>what grace sees</strong>: The apartment window has a perfect
view of the gym parking lot where the killing occurred.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: Reynaud sees that and also
REACTS.</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: We should get out of here. Don’t
touch anything.</p>
<p><strong>int. apartment - day</strong>: Grace watches a CRIMINALIST
bag a comb from the medicine cabinet. A couple hairs entwined in its
teeth. In the kitchen another CRIMINALIST dusts for prints. Reynaud
taking pictures with a large still camera. Laval KNOCKS on the walls.
Laval moves a picture frame. A photograph falls out. Laval picks it up
with surgical gloves.</p>
<p><strong>insert photo</strong>: A dead ringer for Costa’s sketch,
carousing in a Thai bar. Laval shows Grace.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Resembles the man Costa sketched. Have you
released him? You don’t want your star witness steaming in a holding
cell.</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: He went home twenty minutes ago.
Agent Grace, where do you think Monsieur Edwards is?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I bet Monsieur Edwards is in a deep grave
with square corners like Messieurs Kohler and Ford. Which looks like all
the victims. Maybe he’s subconsciously killing himself.</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: We’ll take that with us. Put a
number and seal on that case.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Ever see a Hermit crab?</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: It’s a crab that lives in the shells of dead
sea snails.</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: Yes, yes. They have one big claw
and curl up tight.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: When they outgrow an old shell, they search
for a new empty shell, crawl up to it and quickly switch.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: They live in these beautiful shells because
they have these soft ugly bodies. They couldn’t survive without the
shells. Neither can the guy we’re after.</p>
<p><strong>int. conference room - close on a tv screen - day</strong>:
Surprisingly clear video shot with a long night-vision lens. TODD FORD
exits the 24 Hour Gym, gets in his car.</p>
<p><strong>widen to:</strong>: The Director, Grace, Reynaud and Laval
watch the video on the TV. Director Gillet turns it off. He is not in a
good mood and that has Laval and Reynaud on edge.</p>
<p><strong>director gillet</strong>: We could have had him this
morning.</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: Director, please. We are getting
close. The hairs recovered from the apartment match the hairs recovered
at the crime scene on Ford’s body. We found hours of video like that of
the victim. He has been following him, filming him for weeks. He tapped
his phone and has recordings of Ford’s calls. Even a CD with copies of
Mr. Ford’s E-mail folders.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: With that much detail, you could become
anyone.</p>
<p><strong>director gillet</strong>: So he hunts people and wears their
lives as a kind of trophy.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: More like a kind of camouflage.</p>
<p><strong>director gillet</strong>: What’s his real name?</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: We know what he looks like, we have
his fingerprints, we know what he had for breakfast. But his name eludes
us still.</p>
<p><strong>director gillet</strong>: Find it, Laval. Find him.</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>int. hallway - day</strong>: Director Gillet and Grace walk
down the hall.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: They’re working really hard.</p>
<p><strong>director gillet</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Someone died last night because the asshole
we’re after isn’t in custody. It’s happened to me before and I’m sure it
will happen again. It’s a pretty miserable feeling.</p>
<p><strong>director gillet</strong>: I haven’t felt it in a long time.
Dinner?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Thank you. I promised the boys I’d hang out
tonight. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>int. bistro - night</strong>: Grace, Reynaud and Laval have
mussels and beer. Laval watches the GUITARIST, a little melancholy.</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: I’m fair and I keep my promises. My
informants trust me. I have eyes on the trains, on the buses. If they
see him, they will tell me.</p>
<p><strong>inspector reynaud</strong>: Maybe they will tell you. Why do
you trust junkies?</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: I trust their fear of this.</p>
<p><strong>inspector reynaud</strong>: Don’t say that in front of
her.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: It’s okay. I was a street cop in Philadelphia
for three years before I joined the FBI.</p>
<p><strong>inspector reynaud</strong>: Very nice. You like to play
games.</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: Mr. Ford worked as a cruise-ship
musician. He would walk around and play his guitar on the decks at
night.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Life is pretty cold sometimes. Man’s just
trying to spread a little music and gets murdered.</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: He targeted Mr. Ford the night
before he was supposed to get on a plane and meet a ship in Aruba.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Only the new improved Mr. Ford was going to
meet he ship.</p>
<p><strong>inspector reynaud</strong>: Think he has a plan B?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I doubt it. He’s been so meticulous and
effective in the past, I bet he’s never needed one. We can assume he has
all sorts of fake IDs and passports. Disguises. But that’s not enough
for him, he has to be someone else. He gets off impersonating people.
And he knows his current persona is compromised.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: You’re always thinking. Save
something for tomorrow. We have three boxes of evidence to go
through.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Pretty cavalier attitude for a man who just
got his ass chewed by his boss.</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: My papa dropped dead of a heart
attack in front of a drill press at work. Not me.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I’m dropping by Costa’s, I still have a
couple questions. I can’t turn it off.</p>
<p><strong>ext. art gallery street - night</strong>: A warm night,
people are out. TEENS, COUPLES. Some OLD MEN argue politics. Grace
approaches the gallery, keeping a low profile as she finds an angle to
look inside.</p>
<p><strong>int. art gallery - grace’s pov - night</strong>: John Costa
shares some Merlot with a statuesque ELEGANT WOMAN. She’s laughing,
flirting. Costa is making her laugh.</p>
<p><strong>int. art gallery - night</strong>: Grace enters. Costa sees
her, REACTS, genuinely glad to see her. And that throws Grace a beat.
She really likes his smile.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Mr. Costa.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: You caught me.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Toussant Jean Bernard. I met him in Haiti
last year. Very troubled life. Outlived all his children. And he had
ten. He lost his wife to cancer and went blind. Passed away last
year.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Overpriced folk art. Is it the work of a soul
that has suffered? Sure. Are his explorations as an artist
groundbreaking? No.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Ouch. And I was going to send you two and
charge them to your Amex.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I couldn’t afford it.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: What about Daddy’s Amex? I’ve sold quite a
bit of art to poor little rich girls like you.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Try the wine.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I’m partial to beer. And I don’t have long. I
came by to thank you for your help. And I apologize if you were
detained. You did the right thing. Trying to save him.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Why, thank you. Agent Vanderholt. I’m having
a show Friday. You should come by and meet some good people.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Who knows. Where’d you learn CPR?</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Medical school. Before I dropped out. I had a
moment of clarity: in anatomy class I realized I’d rather draw bodies
than cut them up. And when I realized I couldn’t make art, I decided to
sell it.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Some journey.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: It’s taken me all over the world.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: About Monday again, did you see Mr. Ford
fighting back?</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: At first I thought I was interrupting
something, you know?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: No, I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: I thought they were hugging. Then the gun
came out when he saw me.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I guess that’s it. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: If you remember any details or need anything.
Anything related to the case, please call me.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Okay. Think about Friday. Please, Grace?</p>
<p><strong>int. hotel room - night</strong>: Grace has turned the
romantic little room into a cave of paperwork. Notes and photos cover
the walls. Grace reads a phone bill taped to a lamp. Circles a number
that keeps reappearing.</p>
<p><strong>int. task force room - day</strong>: The place is gearing up
for a new day. Grace crosses to where Laval and Reynaud struggle awake
with coffee and the morning paper. Grace takes a seat, grabs the sports
section. A YOUNG DETECTIVE eats a grapefruit.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Morning. Can you run this name? She got
twenty hang-up calls from Edward’s phone.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: What happened to that beautiful thumbprint on
the orange juice glass, you get an ID?</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: No hits. He’s never been
fingerprinted.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Shit. Any activity on Edward’s accounts?</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: Nothing. I think he became Edwards
a year ago. He was a software engineer. Did everything by the internet,
he never met anyone face to face.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Why a year ago.</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: Edwards went on a river trip.
Kohler was a guide.</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: Those are E-mails between Kohler
and Edwards discussing the trip one year ago.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You connected Edwards and Kohler? Somebody
was working all night.</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: I couldn’t sleep.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Our suspect kills Kohler on the river, lives
his life a year, kills Edwards and assumes his ID for a year. Then he
stalks Ford, kills him but is interrupted by Costa. Think he’s pissed at
Costa?</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>young detective</strong>: Agent Vanderholt, a report came
back on the name.</p>
<p><strong>int. unmarked car - moving - day</strong>: Laval drives fast
through a neat, modest neighborhood. Grace marveling at the police
report.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: She must have sounded like a total
fruitcake.</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: This is it.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Let me go and be non-threatening.</p>
<p><strong>int. asher house - day</strong>: KNOCKING on the front door.
The WOMAN from the ferry answers the door. Her name is REBECCA ASHER.
She opens the door, smiles warmly at Grace.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. asher</strong>: Hi, please come in. Thank you for
coming.</p>
<p><strong>int. asher house - living room - day</strong>: Classy decor.
Grace sips Earl Grey. Admires the impressive antiques.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. asher</strong>: I’m glad they finally sent someone,
those hang-up calls have me terrified. They started right after I saw
him. I looked him directly in the eye. There was a moment of mutual
recognition.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Do you think it’s Martin calling and hanging
up?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. asher</strong>: It couldn’t sound crazier, but who
else?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Were you ever asked to identify his body?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. asher</strong>: The body? Yes, they showed me some
remains that had been hit by a pickup truck. The upper body was crushed.
There was no face. I got physically ill.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. asher</strong>: You’re not Canadian, are you?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: No. I’m with the FBI.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. asher</strong>: There was three. About two weeks ago. I
began turning off my telephone when I go to bed.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You have some very nice things,
Mrs. Asher.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. asher</strong>: Thank you. Some of them have been in my
family for several generations. Please call me Rebecca.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Is that Martin?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. asher</strong>: No. That’s Reese. Martin’s older
brother. He drowned in a terrible accident.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I’m so sorry, Rebecca. How did he drown?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. asher</strong>: The San Michel River. Martin fell out of
their raft and Reese jumped in to save him.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. asher</strong>: There was a lot of snowmelt that year.
Martin reached the bank. Reese didn’t. It was their fourteenth
birthday.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Their fourteenth birthday?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. asher</strong>: They were twins. Identical twins.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You said Reese was older.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. asher</strong>: By three minutes. They were very
different boys.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: To lose one son so young, then to lose the
other two years later; to think you’ve lost him. That must have been
devastating.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. asher</strong>: Reese was very charismatic and outgoing.
Martin was introverted. He never thrived like Reese. He was a very
disturbed young man. Reese was Martin’s world. Martin never recovered
his equilibrium after we lost him. He changed. Martin began to
intimidate me. He could be very menacing. He began imitating Reese at
school and that lead to fights with other students. At sixteen he stole
some jewelry that was very precious to me and ran away. A few days later
the Thunder Bay police called and said my son had been killed changing a
tire.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: The police want you to sign this so they can
exhume the body in Martin’s grave and verify identity.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. asher</strong>: I’ll sign it. I already know somebody
else’s son is in that casket.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. asher</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>int. bathroom - day</strong>: Grace pokes her head in, looks
around. Nothing of note.</p>
<p><strong>int. mrs. asher’s bedroom - day</strong>: The door opens and
Grace peers in. Flowing silk, throw pillows, like a Sultan’s tent.
Interesting.</p>
<p><strong>int. the boys’ room - day</strong>: Grace opens the door.
Bingo. More LAUGHTER O.S. A bed, still made. Old toys. Sports equipment.
An “R” on the headboard. On the other side; shadows on the wall where
pictures used to hang. Indents in the carpet. Where a bed used to be.
Grace’s brow furrows. Martin has been erased.</p>
<p><strong>int. hallway - day</strong>: GROWLING. Grace turns. Sees a
diminutive DOBERMAN SNARLING at her. The miniature hound guards a door.
A door with several locks. Grace takes a step toward it. The tiny dog
bares its fangs. Grace reaches for a deadbolt. The little DOG GROWLING.
One deadbolt is open. CLICK. Grace opens the other one.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. asher</strong>: The bathroom is there.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I know. I was snooping.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. asher</strong>: My friends call it the shrine. It can be
difficult to let go.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. asher</strong>: He’s killing people, isn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: That doesn’t surprise you?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. asher</strong>: No. It doesn’t.</p>
<p><strong>int. unmarked car - moving - day</strong>: Grace gets in.
Laval shaving with an electrical razor. Laval pulls out.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: That lady is definitely a queen without a
country. I should have curtsied. Hygiene on the road. Very
efficient.</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: Merde!</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: She signed. Start digging.</p>
<p><strong>ext. graveyard - day</strong>: A back hoe rips a bucket of
earth from amidst the graves. A couple UNIFORMS watch.</p>
<p><strong>medical examiner</strong>: Hmm. Could be worse after getting
run over by a pickup and twenty years in the ground.</p>
<p><strong>int. autopsy room - day</strong>: The body has been moved to
the exam table. Covered with mold the corpse seems to be upholstered
with baby blue velvet. The Medical Examiner checks the scale.</p>
<p><strong>medical examiner</strong>: Bodies get mixed up all the time.
Police found the wallet, called the mother and nothing was cross-
checked. This was his head.</p>
<p><strong>medical examiner</strong>: Get that to Doctor Shivani and
make sure someone signs for it. She’ll rebuild his jaw line and check it
against Martin Asher’s dental X-rays.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: How soon, sir?</p>
<p><strong>medical examiner</strong>: This is a priority case, this
afternoon maybe.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Vanderholt.</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: Am I interrupting something?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Yes. What?</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: The X-rays don’t match.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Find the real Martin Asher. He’s your killer.
You better get his mother someplace safe.</p>
<p><strong>ext. posh hotel lobby - night</strong>: An UNMARKED parked
with Laval and Grace inside. They watch:</p>
<p><strong>int. posh hotel lobby - grace’s pov - night</strong>: MRS.
ASHER checking in.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: How’d she finagle a room there?</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: She’s a very slick woman.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: She didn’t have one picture of Martin. Not
one. Even cut him out of the old yearbooks. And she had a basement door
like a vault. She’s hiding something. In the basement of her house. What
is it, ten minutes away from here? Her house.</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: If she’s under our protection and
something happens to her house, her belongings, the department could be
liable. There could be a lawsuit.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You’re right. We should make sure her front
door is locked.</p>
<p><strong>int. asher house - night</strong>: The front door opens.
Revealing Grace, and Laval as he pockets a lockpick gun.</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: I’ll stay outside. Kill him if he’s
in there.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Yeah, I’ll get ’em.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Let’s be friends.</p>
<p><strong>int. martin’s cell - night</strong>: Grace moves aside
cobwebs with her big flashlight. The room is tiny. Exposed joists
overhead. Grace sits on the cold concrete. A sleeping bag rolled in the
corner. One wall is just chicken wire. Her flashlight beam stabs at the
yawning darkness beneath the house. There is a public school desk chair
combo. The name MARTIN neatly carved into it, then scratched out. A
broken light bulb overhead, its wires running to a corner of the house.
Grace cautiously unrolls the sleeping bag. A pair of socks, underwear,
T-shirt neatly folded inside. She rolls it back up. Finds a large jar,
picks it up. Very old feces inside, a makeshift toilet. She sets it
down. Grace pulls the door shut. And turns off her flashlight. Pitch
black. So quiet. She sits there, in the musty little cage. Listening to
her BREATHING, to her HEART BEAT. So lonely, so frightening. A tear
rolls down her cheek. She SNIFFLES, wipes away the tear. A beat. Grace
hears SCRATCHING. She clicks on her light.</p>
<p><strong>grace’s flashback - int. martin’s cell - night</strong>:
YOUNG MARTIN ASHER IS HUDDLED in the corner, shivering, CRYING and
WHIMPERING. Martin looks AT us with haunted eyes.</p>
<p><strong>int. martin’s cell - night</strong>: Grace REACTS, nothing is
there. Chuckles for scaring herself. Grace feels the chicken wire. MORE
SCRATCHING. Grace freezes. Listening carefully. Mice? SOMETHING moves
closer.</p>
<p><strong>int. unmarked car - moving - night</strong>: Laval driving
back to Montreal. Grace is shaken.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I think I just shaved ten years off my
life.</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: Ah, you do feel fear.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Yes. Rabies scares me. Only rabies. Nothing
else.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Vanderholt.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Grace. Someone broke into my office. Minutes
ago.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: At the art gallery?</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Yes. My office here.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Are they still there?</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Did you call the police?</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: You told me to call you if anything
happened.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: We’ll be right there. I’m sending a car.
Don’t touch anything.</p>
<p><strong>ext. art gallery - night</strong>: Two POLICE CRUISERS
SCREECH to a stop outside.</p>
<p><strong>int. art gallery office - night</strong>: Wooden painting
crates everywhere. A table saw for making frames. Costa is distressed.
Grace looking at a message typed onto his computer screen.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: I do all my calls to Europe and shipping
stuff at night. My address book was on the screen when I went out for
coffee. I came back and this was on the screen.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: How long were you gone?</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Ten minutes. Maybe. When I returned, that was
on the screen.</p>
<p><strong>frers on rue chaucer. cu @ the bar 1:30 a.m.</strong>:
Reynaud takes a picture of the screen. Laval checking the door’s lock.
Finds no marks. Gives Costa a look.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Is this about the strangling? Is that guy
after me?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Please relax, Mr. Costa. We don’t know if
there’s a connection yet.</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: Is anything missing.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: No. Everything’s here. Shit. He took my
organizer and my business checkbook.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: How do we know Costa didn’t stage this? For
attention or something.</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: He’s happy to see you. But the
alarm was jumpered. Do you think Costa knows how to jumper an alarm?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: We should take the computer.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Don’t take the computer. That’s my brain.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: I’m not making this up. Believe me.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Should I believe you?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Or should I believe this.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Believe what you want.</p>
<p><strong>ext. alley - atm video - night</strong>: Being fast
forwarded. COSTA exits his office. Locks the door. He walks TOWARD
CAMERA and EXITS FRAME. A MAN’S SILHOUETTE in the alley. Crossing
towards the office door. An ATM CUSTOMER blocks the shot. The ATM
customer moves on.</p>
<p><strong>int. task force room - night</strong>: Costa, Grace, Laval
and Reynaud. Costa stands there looking at Asher’s image on the video
monitor.</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: Is that the man you saw choking
Mr. Ford?</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: I must of walked right past him.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Mr. Costa, is that the man you saw kill
Mr. Ford in the parking lot?</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Yes. That’s him. That is the man I saw murder
Todd Ford in the parking lot outside my gym. No doubt. Now will you go
catch him, please?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Thank you. I just needed you to say it.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Who is this guy? He’s like a Ninja. Sneaking
into my office. How dangerous is he? Does he want to kill me?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: John, no harm will come to you. Listen to me.
No harm will come to you. I promise. Anyone who wants to hurt you will
have to get through these two for starters.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: How many people have you killed?</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: You will be safe, my friend.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: We want you to be there tonight.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: No. I’m not meeting him. Absolutely not. You
ever go fishing? The bait always dies.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: He won’t get within fifty feet of you. The
second we see him, the cuffs go on.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Grace, no.</p>
<p><strong>int. stakeout van - night</strong>: Costa gives Grace a look
as Reynaud tapes a microphone to the BODY ARMOR he is wearing.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: What if he shoots me in the head?</p>
<p><strong>inspector reynaud</strong>: I will take the bullet for you
like the Secret Service. Okay, friend?</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: You’re good. You could move a lot of art if
you wanted to.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: And inspire some too, I’m sure.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Don’t worry. You’re doing fine.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Could you look any more like a cop?</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Could I have some water? I’m cooking in this
thing.</p>
<p><strong>various angles</strong>: A half-dozen UNDERCOVERS are mixed
in with the CLUBGOERS. CAMERA FINDS Reynaud sitting at the bar near
Costa, gives Costa a reassuring nod through the crowd.</p>
<p><strong>int. unmarked car - night</strong>: Parked outside the club.
Grace and Laval watch Costa via the TV built into the dash.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Costa fits Asher’s choice of victims. Travels
the World looking for art. Single. No kids or anything. Asher’s here
somewhere. Watching. With all the patience in the world.</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: I wish I had his patience. He
should be a cop. His mother should be punished. Like the owner of pit
bulls that attack kids.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You got kids?</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: Three.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Don’t keep them in a cage.</p>
<p><strong>int. les frers - night</strong>: Costa looks miserable.
Overheating, anxiously nursing his water. He looks around. Then REACTS.
A note sits on the bar top. Right in front of him. Costa looks around.
Only sees strange faces. Costa carefully unfolds the note. It reads:
“MEET ME IN</p>
<p><strong>int. hallway - night</strong>: Costa walks down a narrow
hallway. Paint peeling. MUSIC MUTED. Red light bulbs hanging from the
ceiling. Approaching the men’s room, Costa looks over his shoulder. No
one is watching.</p>
<p><strong>int. men’s room - continuous action</strong>: Costa
cautiously pushes open the door. Stepping inside. Dingy tiles. DRIPPING
FAUCET. Several stalls. The room seems empty. Costa swallows, bends
down. Checks under the stalls. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing… Then.
Something. At the far stall. A pair of men’s shoes. Black. Polished.
Facing the stall door. Waiting… Costa freezes. Backs away as… The stall
door slowly swings open. HINGES CREAK. A foot, a trouser cuff. A leg
stepping out…</p>
<p><strong>black man</strong>: Go outside.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>black man</strong>: We’re calling it off.</p>
<p><strong>ext. alley outside club - night</strong>: Costa bursts from
the fire exit, fed up. He rips off the wire, he struggles out of the
body armor. Grace and Laval watching.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: I have a life. I can’t play superhero for
you. I don’t handle stress very well. I have an art show to open
tomorrow and I don’t know what I’m putting on the walls yet.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I know you have a life. So did the people who
have lost theirs. Someone else might die if you do not help us. Every
time someone dies it affects forty, fifty lives.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Grace, I’ve been cooperating. I even drew you
a picture. You can’t put your responsibility on me. You have a badge,
not me.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: If somebody else dies, and you know you could
have done more to stop it, you’re going to feel like shit for a very
long time, Mr. Costa.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: I want to help you guys but I don’t have time
to hang out and listen to bad techno.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: It’s okay to be scared.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Scared? I’m off-the-charts terrified. There’s
a pissed-off serial killer after me. I mean, what did I do to him?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You saw him and that’s enough. Don’t stop
living your life. You’ll be protected by armed officers twenty-four
seven.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Until he’s caught?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I can’t promise you that.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: I have a lot of work to do.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: A car is watching the gallery. You’ll be
okay.</p>
<p><strong>int. director gillet’s office - day</strong>: Director Gillet
leans against a wall, smoking a pipe. Grace, Laval, Reynaud sit on the
tired couches.</p>
<p><strong>director gillet</strong>: So who was in Asher’s grave?</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: Dan Soulsby. He went missing from
the Alberta Military Institute two days before the accident.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I’m sure Soulsby’s death was a homicide,
Asher saw the opportunity and took it. He became Soulsby and bummed
around Seattle for a couple years.</p>
<p><strong>director gillet</strong>: Why is Asher after Costa? Why isn’t
he in Mexico getting a new face?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Costa saw him. Costa caught him in the act,
caught him being Martin Asher. Seen first by his mother, then by Costa.
For the first time he’s failed at taking a life, and since we found the
apartment, he can’t be Edwards. To be seen, to be recognized, is a
horrifying thing to Asher. He has no identity and wants it that way.</p>
<p><strong>director gillet</strong>: Where is the real Mr. Edwards?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Likely dead and buried south of the border
somewhere. South of the American border somewhere. Visa records put
Asher, using Kohler’s ID and Edwards at a Mexican surf resort. Edwards’
last charge was sixteen hundred dollars at a ‘no questions asked’
facelift clinic in Guadalajara.</p>
<p><strong>director gillet</strong>: Have you contacted the clinic?</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: Yes. They are also ‘no questions
answered.’ Mr. Kohler suddenly paid off his credit card bills, thanks to
money from Edwards.</p>
<p><strong>director gillet</strong>: Keep’s the collection agencies off
the trail. How do we flush Mr. Asher?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: He’s focused on Costa. Who fits the profile
of Asher’s victims. He went on Costa’s computer and E- mailed copies of
Costa’s files to an E-mail account in Denmark. Constant threat of
discovery, Asher will become more disorganized.</p>
<p><strong>director gillet</strong>: Okay. My office will arrange a
press conference. I will tell a room full of correspondents we have a
suspect who is dead and murder victims who are alive. And I’ll sound
like a madman.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: It does sound crazy. That’s what the press
likes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>int. police building lobby - news video - day</strong>:
Director Gillet stands tall before a podium. Blinded by lights. A
bouquet of microphones in his face. Beside him is a haunting
poster-sized portrait of Martin Asher.</p>
<p><strong>director gillet</strong>: Mr. Asher, we know who you really
are. We will find you and we will arrest you. You can hide no
longer.</p>
<p><strong>ext. art gallery - day</strong>: Posters advertise
SUMMERFEST. CITY WORKERS put up barricades and porto-potties.</p>
<p><strong>int. art gallery - day</strong>: Two CARPENTERS uncrate and
hang paintings.</p>
<p><strong>carpenter</strong>: Mr. Costa, some men in that car have been
watching this place all morning.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: They’re protecting the art. Go ahead and hang
those. Be very careful.</p>
<p><strong>carpenter</strong>: Yessir.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Security is going to be very solid
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Is he going to show up tonight? What do I do,
offer him a drink?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: He won’t show. But we want to be here in case
he does. Four plainclothes officers will form a perimeter watching the
four corners.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: A perimeter, excellent.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Yes. And four plainclothes officers will be
in here. Mingling.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Mingling? I don’t need four bruisers crashing
through my clientele.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: The officers will be very discreet. We won’t
interfere with your thing.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: With my thing. Will you be mingling?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Sure. If you feel safer.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Much safer.</p>
<p><strong>ext. art gallery - night</strong>: Summerfest, a street
festival, is just warming up. It could be Mardi Gras, plastic cups and
glowsticks.</p>
<p><strong>int. art gallery - night</strong>: A cutting edge club feel.
A DJ spins a captivating mellow mix. The gallery is filled PATRONS ABUZZ
with chit-chat. Inspector Laval and Reynaud study the patrons.</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: This painting costs more than my
house.</p>
<p><strong>find grace</strong>: She’s stunning and shy about it. She
examines a painting. A gentle hand touches her back. She turns. It’s
Costa. He hands her a highball.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: You look a little anxious.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: This isn’t me.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: It’s all you.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I’m trying to get into the show, but I mean.
What is this? It looks like somebody napalmed the Garden of Eden.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Mangos. Ripe mangos hanging on a branch.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Oh. Okay. Why the borders? Almost every
painting has one. Was he in prison or something?</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Most people don’t notice. This is from his
prison series. He could see a mango grove through his cell window. He
made some of the pigments himself. From flowers. From his own blood.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: What was his crime?</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: He attacked his neighbor with a machete.
There was a woman involved.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Always is.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: He had a lot of lovers, didn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Dozens. He was a consumer of life’s
pleasures.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Now he’s dead and you get rich?</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: His children formed a corporation, I take ten
percent. I’m not a buccaneer, Grace.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I don’t think I’ve ever met anyone quite like
you.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: You’re very sensitive for…</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: An FBI agent?</p>
<p><strong>elegant woman</strong>: John, it’s amazing tonight. I want to
cry, I’m so touched.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Mr. Costa, I would like to discuss an
arrangement for the series.</p>
<p><strong>elegant woman</strong>: Just a sec, John.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: She’s not writing the checks.</p>
<p><strong>older man</strong>: John, it’s incredible what you’ve put
together. The thing we were talking about the other day, well I’d like
to proceed. Hell, I’m sick of making two percent in the market.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Dick, they’re yours.</p>
<p><strong>int. art gallery - night</strong>: A few minutes later Costa
finds Grace at the turntables looking through the DJ’s records.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Don’t you miss wax?</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: You helped me close the biggest sale of the
night.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: What’s my cut?</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Let me know when you do. Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>int. art gallery - bathroom - night</strong>: Costa takes a
leak. He’s in a good mood.</p>
<p><strong>someone behind him</strong>: Costa looks in the mirror and
REACTS. MARTIN ASHER stares at him from the mirror. No doubt who it is.
Asher is wound tight, not at all happy.</p>
<p><strong>asher</strong>: Put your hands on the wall.</p>
<p><strong>asher</strong>: Feel that?</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Please be cool with that. I don’t wanna get
hurt.</p>
<p><strong>asher</strong>: I should blow your spine out. My face is
everywhere. I have to hide in the shadows like a fucking animal because
of you.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Yessir. I apologize for everything you think
I may have done.</p>
<p><strong>asher</strong>: We’re moved past sorry. You ruined
everything. John, soon to be dead, Costa.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Stop it!</p>
<p><strong>int. art gallery - night</strong>: Reynaud stands near the
bathroom. He heard that. He approaches the door, tests the knob.</p>
<p><strong>int. art gallery - night</strong>: Asher bursts from the
bathroom, running right over Reynaud, who draws his pistol. Grace pulls
a pistol, Laval too. Asher running through the patrons. Grace takes a
knee and aims. She doesn’t have a clear shot. Asher aims his gun
straight ahead as he runs. People hit the deck.</p>
<p><strong>asher</strong>: Out of my way!</p>
<p><strong>ext. art gallery - night</strong>: Chaos. Summerfest is in
full swing. A swirling, boiling CROWD of shiny faces. Asher dives into
their midst. Grace plunges in after him. Inspector Laval follows.</p>
<p><strong>int. art gallery - bathroom - night</strong>: Costa is
stunned, Reynaud checks him for bullet holes.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: I’m okay.</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: Jean, he ran into the damn
crowd.</p>
<p><strong>ext. festival street - night</strong>: Asher and his pursuers
leave a wake of disturbed REVELERS that Reynaud follows. Asher running.
Careening, rolling, bouncing off PEOPLE. He has the tireless power of a
soccer player.</p>
<p><strong>inspector laval</strong>: We’re heading East. Form a line at
Seychelles.</p>
<p><strong>ext. intersection - day</strong>: Police RADIOS busy with
CHATTER. UNIFORMS clear a path for two PATROL CARS. SIRENS WHOOP as they
coast in, TAP bumpers, blocking the intersection. POLICE OFFICERS form a
formidable skirmish line. SHOUTING for REVELERS to move aside.</p>
<p><strong>ext. festival street - night</strong>: Asher running. Gun in
his pocket. Elbowing his way through the crowd. Asher REACTS. He sees
the gauntlet of UNIFORMS and PATROL CARS blocking the intersection
ahead. Asher shoves his hand in his pocket…</p>
<p><strong>boom! boom-boom! pop-pop-pop!</strong>: Thunderous GUNFIRE.
Grace hits the deck. The Uniforms hit the deck. The CROWD SCREAMS, CLAPS
and WHISTLES. It’s not gunfire…</p>
<p><strong>tilt up.</strong>: FIREWORKS unfold in the night sky like
giant flowers of fire. Rivers of sparks. Grace recovers her feet with
palpable relief, she thought she was dead for a second. Grace looking
around for Asher. Laval reaches her.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Shit. You see him?</p>
<p><strong>a shrill scream o.s.</strong>: From an apartment building.
Grace runs into the building. Laval follows her.</p>
<p><strong>int. apartment - hallway - night</strong>: Grace and Laval
running. More SCREAMING O.S. They run upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>int. upset woman’s apartment - night</strong>: The SLIDING
GLASS DOOR to the balcony has been shattered. Below and beyond is a long
rooftop. Madly lit by a swirl of bright lights. A huge outdoor dance
floor throbs with energy in a park along the St. Lawrence River.</p>
<p><strong>grace sees –</strong>: ASHER jump from the far end of the
roof.</p>
<p><strong>ext. rooftop - night</strong>: Laval will go no further.
Grace gets a running start, jumps from the apartment window, tucks and
rolls. On her feet again, Grace sprints along the roof. FIREWORKS BOOM
and POP overhead. THUMPING TECHNO. Grace reaches the edge of the roof.
REACTS. Reynaud has caught up with her.</p>
<p><strong>ext. river park - grace’s pov - night</strong>: Asher has
vanished into a vast sea of DANCERS, adorned with strobing and glowing
jewelry. The BEAT dominates all sound.</p>
<p><strong>find grace –</strong>: She and Reynaud scan the moving bodies
for Asher. Grace GLIMPSES the back of Asher’s head. Grace and Reynaud
tear through the crowd like bulls, working together, a bonding moment.
Asher is an arm’s length ahead of Grace. She reaches out, her fingers
snag the cloth of his shirt. Asher turns…</p>
<p><strong>it’s not asher.</strong>: Grace shoves him aside and moves
on. She SEES a disturbance up ahead. Grace shoulders her way through the
crowd. Grace and Reynaud converge on the disturbance. They cleave
through ONLOOKERS to reveal…</p>
<p><strong>a fight</strong>: Two drunk COLLEGE JOCKS slug it out. Grace
looks around; no Asher. Angry, frustrated, Grace grabs one of the Jocks,
hurls him to the ground. Six UNIFORMS swarm in and arrest the two Jocks.
Reynaud throws up his arms in frustration. He looks at Grace, they know
they’ve been beaten.</p>
<p><strong>ext. river park - crane shot - night</strong>: PULL BACK to
reveal Grace and Reynaud surrounded by an ocean of bodies in motion.</p>
<p><strong>camera finds a dancer.</strong>: Some dude with his shirt off
grinds on three HOTTIES.</p>
<p><strong>asher’s eyes</strong>: Dangerous and cold. They track Grace
as she moves through the crowd. Asher grabs one of the hotties, begins
making out with her. Grace searching the crowd. Scanning faces. Grace
passes within feet of Asher. Asher smirks. Now another hottie wants a
kiss. Asher complies.</p>
<p><strong>int. art gallery - night</strong>: It’s late. Costa has a
beer, his nose bandaged. INSPECTORS finish up questioning PATRONS. Grace
enters, crosses to Costa. She’s tense, wound tight.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Need a ride home?</p>
<p><strong>int. unmarked car - moving - late night</strong>: Grace
drives. Costa in the passenger seat.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: The night started out great. Everything
gelled. Everyone was happy. You helped land a big fish and the feeding
frenzy started. Six figure pieces were flying off the wall. He said he
was going to blow out my spine. I was thinking surgery. Six months in
bed. Exercise pools. Never walking again.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: He was in my bathroom and none of you could
stop him. I need to leave town.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: That might be a good idea. Until then I’ll
check under your bed for monsters.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: I would appreciate that very much. Can I
profile you? I read your book.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Please, don’t.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Thirty-something, single white female. Best
schools best grades. Discovers adrenaline policing the inner city.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: John, stop it. Please. Let’s shift the
conversation from me and my business onto something inbounds.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Okay. Are you going to my funeral when Martin
Asher cuts my throat?</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: You let him get away.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: No excuses. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: I meant you in the general sense. Can you
catch him?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: We got his name. We catch everyone sooner or
later.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Sooner, please.</p>
<p><strong>int. costa’s apartment - night</strong>: Spacious, lofty.
Costa and Grace enter.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Careful.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: I’m sorry. It’s a sty. Must be a profiling
mother lode.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I’m done profiling you. I got you figured
out.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: A failed healer, a failed artist.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Is that how you see yourself?</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: No. That’s you. I did it last night.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: This is how you see me?</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: No. It’s how I think you see yourself.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: And how do you see me?</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: That would be out of bounds.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I don’t know. John, games are fun. But head
games are dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Then keep your head out of it.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: The Justice minister is going to relocate you
to another city until Mr. Asher is in custody.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: I don’t know what your deal is. One second
you’re so there, then all I get is the badge.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I apologize if you’ve been getting the wrong
signal.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Yeah. Relocate where?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Another province. They want you on a flight
tomorrow morning.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: This monster comes into my life and I have to
leave?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: My people are in place.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Thank you, Sergeant.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: This is surreal. What do I pack?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: What you need. Movers can get the rest.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: I need tomorrow morning to finish up my
business here.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I’ll let them know.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: I thought you were going to check under my
bed.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: No monsters.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I probably won’t see you again until the
trial. If there is a trial.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Goodbye, then.</p>
<p><strong>new angle</strong>: Reynaud and Grace have just pulled to the
curb a half block away.</p>
<p><strong>int. unmarked #2 - day</strong>: Reynaud behind the wheel,
turns to Grace.</p>
<p><strong>inspector reynaud</strong>: You spent a lot of time with
Costa.</p>
<p><strong>inspector reynaud</strong>: I like him. He’s a good guy.</p>
<p><strong>ext. costa’s apartment - day</strong>: Laval RINGING the
bell. A white PLUMBER’S VAN pulls up behind Laval’s unmarked. A PLUMBER
gets out. Coveralls, clipboard. Crosses to another apartment. Costa
opens the door. With two packed bags. Laval takes one. Costa takes one
last look at his home. Locks the door. Laval watches the plumber
KNOCKING a couple doors down. Costa and Laval cross to unmarked #1. The
plumber approaches them. Costa looking at him,</p>
<p><strong>reacts.</strong>: The plumber is MARTIN ASHER. A gun in his
hand. Laval drops Costa’s bag, reaches for his holster… POP-POP-POP!
Asher drops Laval with three to the face.</p>
<p><strong>asher</strong>: You’re driving.</p>
<p><strong>int. unmarked #2 - moving - day</strong>: Reynaud GUNS
IT.</p>
<p><strong>int. unmarked #1 - day</strong>: Costa behind the wheel.
Asher in the passenger seat.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: You just shot a cop.</p>
<p><strong>asher</strong>: Let’s go. Go!</p>
<p><strong>ext. costa’s apartment - day</strong>: SCREECH! Reynaud
slides to a stop. Leaps from the still-moving car and checks his friend
Laval. Who is no more. Grace wants to get Asher.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You staying or going?</p>
<p><strong>inspector reynaud</strong>: I’m not leaving.</p>
<p><strong>int. unmarked #1 - moving - day</strong>: Costa driving.
Scared to death. Asher has the gun in his lap aimed at Costa’s face.
Asher looks exhausted. Hounded. Asher notes the police radio.</p>
<p><strong>asher</strong>: Jesus, he was a cop. He’s dead because of
you, because you made the choice. The choice to fuck with me. That,
John, was a very bad choice.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Which way? Left, right?</p>
<p><strong>asher</strong>: Left.</p>
<p><strong>asher</strong>: You’re dead, John Costa. You fucked with the
wrong man, shitsmear.</p>
<p><strong>asher</strong>: Faster, asshole.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: I’m flooring it.</p>
<p><strong>asher</strong>: Shut up. Faster.</p>
<p><strong>asher</strong>: Give me your wallet. Give it over. Right
now.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Are you going to kill me?</p>
<p><strong>asher</strong>: You’re goddamn right I am. I’ve been dreaming
about it, John.</p>
<p><strong>int. unmarked #2 - moving - day</strong>: Grace FLOORING IT.
Sails onto the highway.</p>
<p><strong>int. unmarked #1 - moving - day</strong>: Costa gets stuck
behind a slow-moving truck.</p>
<p><strong>asher</strong>: Pass the truck, John. Before I blow your head
off!</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: God help me.</p>
<p><strong>an oncoming truck</strong>: A head-on imminent. The Buick
swerves onto the shoulder. Just missing them.</p>
<p><strong>int. unmarked #2 - moving - day</strong>: Grace watches
Costa’s unmarked SCRAPE past the truck. A side mirror is knocked off.
The oncoming Buick swerves back onto the asphalt. Overcompensates, now
heading right for Grace… Grace REACTS, swerves. BAM! The cars hit. Grace
gets a face full of airbag.</p>
<p><strong>ext. two lane highway - day</strong>: Grace’s car spins off
the road. Stops in a ditch. A beat. The Buick’s hulk blocking the road.
Grace exits the unmarked. Dazed but unhurt. She crosses to the Buick.
Three HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS are in the car.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Is everyone okay?</p>
<p><strong>girl #1</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>girl #2</strong>: I think so.</p>
<p><strong>girl #3</strong>: Omigod, I have to call my mom.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: They’re okay. Let’s go. He just shot a
cop.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Let’s go. Bad guy’s that way.</p>
<p><strong>int. unmarked #1 - moving - day</strong>: Costa is driving
towards the mountains. Driving through the pine forest.</p>
<p><strong>asher</strong>: There. Turn there.</p>
<p><strong>asher</strong>: Careful.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Okay. Sorry. Sorry. You don’t want to do
this.</p>
<p><strong>asher</strong>: Yes I do. John, do you have any idea how many
people I have killed? It’s always been business. This time is
personal.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Please be cool. C’mon, we don’t even know
each other.</p>
<p><strong>asher</strong>: Shut up. Art Man. You are stupid or crazy or
both. Will you drive faster? I’ll shoot you in the thigh. Will that get
your attention.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Don’t, man. I got money. You want money, I’ll
give you money. I got paintings. What do you want? Talk to me,
Martin.</p>
<p><strong>asher</strong>: I am not Martin. There is no Martin.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Of course. No Martin. What do you want?
What’s my life worth to you?</p>
<p><strong>asher</strong>: Nothing. And everything. This is deeper than
money. Shut up. Talk is done. Talk is over. Understand that. You are
over. Just shut the fuck up.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Okay, please, Martin. Martin. Be cool.</p>
<p><strong>asher</strong>: Who the fuck is Martin?</p>
<p><strong>int. police car - moving - day</strong>: The Cop GUNS it into
the mountains. A fork in the road.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Which way do I turn?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Which way’s the river? Go to the river.</p>
<p><strong>ext. forest crash site - day</strong>: Oil smoke and steam
pour from the unmarked #1. Costa is alive, cut bad. He looks at
Asher.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Rot in hell, Martin Asher.</p>
<p><strong>int. unmarked #1 - costa’s pov - day</strong>: Asher’s head
is stuck through the windshield, his throat cut bad by glass. He’s
alive. Asher panic-sucks deep breaths.</p>
<p><strong>ext. forest crash site - day</strong>: Costa undoes his
safety belt. Grabs the door handle. The door pops open. Costa pulls
himself from the wreck. Flames spread under the car.</p>
<p><strong>ext./int. unmarked #2 - moving - day</strong>: They race
along a mountain road with a view of the St. Lawrence River below. They
can see far up the road, no sign of the unmarked #1. Grace looks behind
them, reacts.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Turn around.</p>
<p><strong>ext. forest crash site - day</strong>: Costa lays by the
road. Motionless, he may be hurt bad.</p>
<p><strong>unmarked #1</strong>: is now Martin Asher’s funeral pyre.
Flames engulf everything. Even the glass is melting.</p>
<p><strong>boom! a tire explodes.</strong>: Costa stirs, crawls on his
hands and knees, into the road away from the wreck. POP-POP-POP!
AMMUNITION in the unmarked EXPLODES from the heat. A police car arrives.
SCREECHES to a stop alongside Costa. Grace leaps from the passenger
side. She grabs Costa, helps him into the back. POP-POP-POP! More AMMO
COOKING</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>int. police car - moving - day</strong>: The Cop backs up
fast. BOOM! Another tire. Now the tree has caught fire. Grace examines
Costa, running her hands over Costa’s battered body.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Nothing broken?</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: I think my hand is broken.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Don’t move, okay.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: This hurt?</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: God yes. Stop that.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You’re going to the hospital. You’ll be
fine.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Is he dead?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Very dead.</p>
<p><strong>ext. forest crash site - day</strong>: Crime scene tape.
POLICEMEN form a perimeter. The fire is out. A Fire Truck pumps water
for a three-man HOSE TEAM cooling the hot metal. A plume of steam rises
up the scorched tree trunk. The car is nothing more than blackened sheet
metal. Asher has been reduced to a charred torso.</p>
<p><strong>int. hospital - day</strong>: Reynaud sits by himself, his
head between his knees. Mourning Laval, dead on a nearby gurney.
Director Gillet crosses to him. Lays a comforting hand on Reynaud’s
shoulder. Reynaud sees who it is, stands crisply, wipes his tears,
embarrassed.</p>
<p><strong>inspector reynaud</strong>: I am sorry, sir.</p>
<p><strong>director gillet</strong>: Please, Jean. I called your wife.
I’m having someone take you home to her. There is nothing left to do
here.</p>
<p><strong>director gillet</strong>: I’m ordering you home.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You’re really good with people.</p>
<p><strong>director gillet</strong>: How’s Mr. Costa?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: He got off light. With a broken wrist and
fifty stitches. Lucky man.</p>
<p><strong>director gillet</strong>: My luck has run out. Until today I
have never had to bury a friend.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I’m sorry, Director.</p>
<p><strong>director gillet</strong>: Thankfully it’s over. We have our
man. Asher’s DNA matched the hairs recovered on Ford’s body and in the
apartment.</p>
<p><strong>int. hospital - exam room - day</strong>: Costa’s scalp is
being stitched shut. Costa’s wrist is in a splint. She watches the
DOCTOR sew flesh for a beat. A KNOCK. Grace enters. Grace smiles warmly
at Costa.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Hey. Ouch, Doc. That’s not rawhide.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: I’ll inject more anesthetic.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: I’m okay. Thank you for rescuing me.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Anytime. Do you know where he was taking
you?</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: To my grave. He was going to kill me.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: It’s over. Let me take you out tonight. Let’s
have some fun. I owe you that.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: What’s fun for you? You want to go to the
shooting range or the morgue?</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: It’s going to take a couple days to depose
you and get a full statement. I thought you might enjoy a break before
you have to…</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: I know a place. You drive.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: I’m happy to be alive but it’s like this door
has been opened. I don’t think I was naive. But everything is different
now.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You’ll fold this experience into your life
and be stronger for it.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: How do you deal with it? All the misery and
pain and violence.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I can stop monsters, John. And because I can,
I have to.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: So is it a calling or a curse?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Neither. It’s just my job.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: When I was in med school I saw a guy on a
Harley get T-boned by a Daihatsu. He was screaming in pain and needed
help and I knew what to do, I had all my certs, but I saw all this blood
and froze. I failed the big test. Bye-bye, med school. Hello, graphic
design.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Roy Wilson.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: The man on the Harley.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: So you knew about that. No wonder you knew
what to say to keep me cooperating.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You’re a sharp one, John Costa.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: You threw me in a tiger cage like a piece of
meat.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: That’s right. You were the cheese in the
trap. We stopped a monster. That’s what matters.</p>
<p><strong>int. hotel room - night</strong>: Grace is in manic cleaning
mode. She pulls papers off the walls. Shoves a pile of clothing in the
closet. Sweeps coffee cups into a wastebasket. She opens the door for
Costa. He enters. The room is still a mess, but it feels safe, cozy.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I’m sorry. I’m a pig.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: I don’t trust anyone who’s too organized.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Want a beer?</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Which is it, are you a runner or chaser?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: What’s that mean?</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: People like you –</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: People like me?</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Yeah, people like you. Hardcore. Gung-ho
people like you. And you know what I mean. People like you are either
runners or chasers.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You are a trip, John Costa.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Okay. I guess I’m running and chasing.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: I’m sorry. I didn’t know.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Growing up I quit speaking after that. I
didn’t say a word for three years. When you’re not in the conversation,
you get forgotten real quick. So I’d watch people. Study them. The mouth
can say anything, but the body doesn’t lie. The tilt of the head, the
way the hands move.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: How’d you get your voice back?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: The day my Uncle died. The truth exploded out
of me like a vision. My Uncle and Father had been arguing, there was a
gunshot and my father was dead.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: You are very intense, you know that?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I remember my Uncle telling me not to say
anything. And I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I made myself forget why. The day he died my
voice and my memory came back. I screamed for an hour. Very primal. I
haven’t shut up since.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Why did your Uncle do it?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Land. Great-grandpa owned half of
Pennsylvania. My Uncle wanted control and sold it all. All that’s left
is an old farmhouse and a horse pasture. My father’s murderer got away
with it because I couldn’t open my mouth.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: That’s a hell of a lot of responsibility for
you to put on the shoulders of an eight-year-old girl.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Something good game out of it. The dead can’t
speak. Now I’m their voice.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Martin Asher is dead, right?</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Can we please forget about him?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: That’s the point. He’s dead, so there won’t
be a trial where you or I would have to admit under oath that we did
anything inappropriate.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: We haven’t done anything.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: In college we tried to make my friend’s
German Shepherd take a bong hit.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: How mean. Serves you right.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Let them watch.</p>
<p><strong>int. bathroom - day</strong>: Grace enters, groggy. Turns on
the sink. Flips on the light. Grace reacts, stumbles back. She’s covered
with blood. Grace panics, feels herself for wounds.</p>
<p><strong>int. hotel room - day</strong>: Grace shakes Costa. Tears
well in her eyes.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: John. John.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Mmmmm. Morning.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: My stitches must have ripped.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I thought you were scared of blood?</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: You better take a shower.</p>
<p><strong>int. autopsy room - night</strong>: Mrs. Asher looking at
Martin Asher’s remains. The charred torso, blackened thighbones.
Mrs. Asher reaches for Asher’s red swollen face.</p>
<p><strong>medical examiner</strong>: Please don’t touch the
remains.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. asher</strong>: Nineteen years ago I stood in this same
room and your predecessor showed me a washtub full of blood and guts and
told me it was my son. I will touch anything I want, Doctor. I’m not
going through this a third time.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. asher</strong>: It’s not him. That’s not my blood. You
people are incredible.</p>
<p><strong>medical examiner</strong>: I’ll swab your cheek and test your
DNA against the body. Will that do it?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. asher</strong>: Good idea, Doctor. He’s smarter than all
of you, do you know that?</p>
<p><strong>int. exam room - day</strong>: The Doctor staples Costa’s
scalp.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Is that going to hold? I’m not coming
back.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: That was my boss. I’m going back to Quantico
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Washington, DC has some of the best art in
the world. Georgetown would be a great place to open a gallery.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Staple his mouth too, Doc.</p>
<p><strong>int. hospital - hallway - day</strong>: Grace leans against a
wall.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Vanderholt.</p>
<p><strong>medical examiner</strong>: Grace. I ran Mrs. Asher’s DNA
against the suspect down here. No way it’s her son.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Not her son? You’re sure?</p>
<p><strong>medical examiner</strong>: Lab ran the test twice.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: That’s weird. Was he adopted, switched at
birth?</p>
<p><strong>medical examiner</strong>: Listen for a minute. There was a
match. John Costa is Mrs. Asher’s biological son.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: So John Costa is really Martin Asher?</p>
<p><strong>medical examiner</strong>: Dear God, I wish I was joking.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Are you Martin?</p>
<p><strong>costa</strong>: Grace, I’m John. Okay? I’m John.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Holy shit.</p>
<p><strong>int. hospital - costa’s pov - day</strong>: Grace’s purse
sits on a chair in the exam room. Her pistol visible.</p>
<p><strong>int. hospital - hallway - day</strong>: Costa takes the gun
from her purse, pockets it, along with her FBI credentials and car keys.
Costa backs away from Grace. Costa’s physicality transforms from hip art
dealer to something much more menacing. The monster Martin Asher. Grace
looks him dead in the eye, more angry than scared.</p>
<p><strong>asher</strong>: She screwed it up, didn’t she?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>asher</strong>: I should have cut her throat when I saw her
on the ferry. That’s the least she deserves. Please don’t do anything,
Grace. It would hurt me so much if I had to hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Good idea. Don’t hurt me.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>ext. hospital - day</strong>: Asher gets into Grace’s
unmarked. And drives away. Grace exits the building, watches him go.
Grace has no way to follow. Then… She sees a COP talking to a cute NURSE
by his patrol car.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Police emergency. We need to pursue him. He’s
a murder suspect.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Director Gillet, there’s an emergency, can
you please tell this officer to cooperate with me?</p>
<p><strong>ext. nice hotel - day</strong>: A patrol car stops in front.
Grace leaps out and runs into the building. An Unmarked pulls up.
Reynaud jumps out and enters the building.</p>
<p><strong>int. hotel room - grace’s pov - day</strong>: A MAID changes
the sheets. Mrs. Asher is gone.</p>
<p><strong>int. asher house - day</strong>: Mrs. Asher answers a KNOCK
at her door. Mrs. Asher</p>
<p><strong>asher</strong>: Hello, Mother.</p>
<p><strong>ext. highway - day</strong>: SIRENS SCREAMING, flashing
lights as six police cars zip by at 90.</p>
<p><strong>int. unmarked - day</strong>: Grace over the shock and harder
than steel. Reynaud drives fast. Grace on her cell.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: No answer. She turns her phone off.</p>
<p><strong>int. asher house - living room - day</strong>: Mrs. Asher
sits on her couch. Asher stands. The teeny Doberman walks into the room,
sniffs Asher.</p>
<p><strong>asher</strong>: What happened to Rex? He was a real dog,
right, Mom?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. asher</strong>: Don’t show me that, Martin. I had Rex
put down after you ran away. Martin, sit.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. asher</strong>: How dare you defy me. You will sit down
on that couch and you will do it now. Martin.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. asher</strong>: Martin, you have severe emotional
problems. I know you’re in a lot of pain. There’s hope and help, Martin.
Look at me, Martin. I love you very much.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I know now that what you did to me was not
love.</p>
<p><strong>int. asher house - living room - day</strong>: Asher sitting
on the couch. Then stands.</p>
<p><strong>asher</strong>: I’ll stand if I want to stand. I can do
anything I want to do. And I’ve done some great things, Mother. I’m not
a scared little boy you can push around anymore.</p>
<p><strong>new angle</strong>: Mrs. Asher’s head neatly adorns a silver
platter.</p>
<p><strong>int. police car - moving - day</strong>: Grace holds on as
Reynaud slaloms around a corner in Asher’s neighborhood.</p>
<p><strong>inspector reynaud</strong>: I hope the son of a bitch doesn’t
shoot me with the gun you gave him. What else did you give Asher?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Shut up and focus. That kind of shit helps no
one right now.</p>
<p><strong>ext. asher house - day</strong>: Reynaud’s car SLIDES to a
stop. Police cars take position around the block, forming a perimeter
around the house. Grace and Reynaud exit the car. Grace has a shotgun.
Four UNIFORMS, also with shotguns, join them. The ad hoc entry team runs
up the steps, onto the porch.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Get right, I got left.</p>
<p><strong>int. asher house - day</strong>: Grace, Reynaud and the four
Uniforms enter. Weapons sweep for targets and clear sectors. Grace
moving down the hallway. Slowly, breathing hard.</p>
<p><strong>int. asher house - living room - day</strong>: Grace enters,
approaching the couch. SOMEONE is there. Grace sidesteps quickly, raises
the shotgun.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Don’t move!</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Omigod.</p>
<p><strong>inspector reynaud</strong>: He’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>angle on grace</strong>: watching this. Reynaud crosses to
her. SLAPS her.</p>
<p><strong>inspector reynaud</strong>: My best friend died protecting a
serial killer so you could get laid. Very nice.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: That’s none of your business.</p>
<p><strong>inspector reynaud</strong>: No? It’s my case.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Back off, Reynaud. Asher fooled you too.</p>
<p><strong>inspector reynaud</strong>: At least I didn’t fuck him.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Touch me again and I will kick your ass.</p>
<p><strong>inspector reynaud</strong>: I am taking you to the
Director.</p>
<p><strong>int. director’s gillet’s office - day</strong>: Gillet sits
at her desk across from Grace. His eyes are harder than normal.</p>
<p><strong>director gillet</strong>: They’re on their way from the
airport.</p>
<p><strong>director gillet</strong>: Your old life is over. There is no
going back.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>director gillet</strong>: You’re still young. Whatever
happens, be strong. Where is he, Grace? How do we find him?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Director, I’m the last person you should be
discussing the case with at this point.</p>
<p><strong>director gillet</strong>: Grace. You know his mind, and his
heart. Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Not here. This city no longer has the psychic
gravity to hold him here. Try Mexico, getting a facelift.</p>
<p><strong>director gillet</strong>: We ID’d the remains in the morgue.
The real ID.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Richard Hart.</p>
<p><strong>flashback - int. hart’s apartment - day</strong>: Hart rolls
painting canvases into a tight cylinder. Inserts it into a fancy lamp. A
hypodermic stands by to reward his work.</p>
<p><strong>director gillet</strong>: He was an addict. And a thief. An
art thief. He hits galleries in Europe and North America. Traveled back
and forth smuggling and selling stolen canvasses.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Let me guess, Costa was selling stolen art
for Hart and never gave him the money. Now Hart is just another one of
Asher’s victims.</p>
<p><strong>director gillet</strong>: Costa owed him eight thousand.
Those are E-mails off Hart’s computer.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Go to hell. I won’t pay you a dime. I’m not
scared of you.</p>
<p><strong>flashback - int. internet cafe - night</strong>: Richard Hart
checks his E-mail and nearly has a heart attack.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Come and get me. I will never pay you,
dumbass. Asher taunted Hart into a confrontation. Jesus. It was right
there in my face. I was interpreting behavior from two different
suspects.</p>
<p><strong>director gillet</strong>: He had us all fooled, Grace. All of
us. If Asher can do that, what else can he do?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Anything he wants.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Ah, the undertakers have arrived for my
career.</p>
<p><strong>int. fbi conference room - day</strong>: Grace is on the
spot. Her LAWYER by her side. Facing a panel of seven SENIOR AGENTS.
Microphones, water pitchers.</p>
<p><strong>senior agent</strong>: Have your rights been explained to you
and has an indication to that effect been made in your employee
record?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Yessir.</p>
<p><strong>int. fbi conference room - night</strong>: Grace is
exhausted, but holding up well. The questions don’t stop.</p>
<p><strong>senior agent</strong>: Agent Vanderholt. Why would Asher kill
Ford, if nobody knew he was Costa. If he wasn’t going to use Ford’s
identity?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: He needed a murder he could link not only
Richard Hart to but also to his past victims.</p>
<p><strong>flashback - int. hart’s apartment - day</strong>: Upscale
Euro-hip. Hart SLAMS down the phone. Shoves a gun in his belt and
exits.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Hart’s behavior was consistent with a
disorganized drug addict following the rules of the criminal road by
attempting to kill a debtor who won’t pay. He had no idea he was being
manipulated by a serial killer.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Asher wasn’t becoming disorganized and
decomposing into madness, he was evolving.</p>
<p><strong>ext. parking lot - night</strong>: Asher, his face obscured
with a sweatshirt hood, pulls Todd Ford from the trunk.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: The Ford murder was staged and I missed it.
Asher drove Ford’s car there with Ford unconscious in the car. Ether
maybe, GHB. Something that disappears. Asher works out, heads to the
parking lot. Pulls Ford out of the trunk. And strangles him. He left a
couple of Hart’s hairs on the body.</p>
<p><strong>int. interrogation room - night</strong>: Asher drawing the
sketch of who we now know was Hart. Is that a sly grin Asher has?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: He draws a nice portrait of Mr. Hart and he’s
now inside the heart of Montreal PD’s investigation.</p>
<p><strong>int. asher’s apartment - day</strong>: In the bathroom,
Asher, wearing surgical gloves, places Hart’s comb in the medicine
cabinet. Puts Hart’s trash in the wastebasket.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Evidence at the Ford crime scene led to an
apartment with more of Hart’s DNA. And evidence linking Hart to Asher’s
crimes. Hart never set food in that apartment. Asher staged
everything.</p>
<p><strong>ext. festival street - night</strong>: Grace chasing
Hart.</p>
<p><strong>senior agent</strong>: Mr. Hart, not Asher, murdered the
Montreal Inspector, correct?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Yes. Hart thought Costa was systematically
destroying his life. Hart’s violent explosion was inevitable.</p>
<p><strong>senior agent</strong>: How could Asher plan on Hart snapping
like that?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: He couldn’t. My guess is Asher intended to
kill Hart and make it look like suicide. The authorities would find the
body and close the Martin Asher file.</p>
<p><strong>int. fbi conference room - the next day</strong>: Things are
wrapping up.</p>
<p><strong>senior agent</strong>: This ethics panel has no choice but to
recommend terminating you for misconduct. Do you wish to make a
statement?</p>
<p><strong>senior agent</strong>: Please speak up for the record.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: No. I have nothing to say.</p>
<p><strong>ext. quantico parking lot - day</strong>: Grace heaves the
box into the back of her Audi. A GSA police car stands by. DICK COLTON,
her ex-boss intercepts her before she gets in.</p>
<p><strong>colton</strong>: Grace. This is a bitter loss to the
unit.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You’ll manage.</p>
<p><strong>colton</strong>: Want some good news? RCMP closed their
investigation and the Minister isn’t indicting you. This could have been
a real train wreck for you, Grace.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: It wasn’t?</p>
<p><strong>colton</strong>: No one has any clue where Asher is. That son
of a bitch might fixate on you. Please watch your back, Grace.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I’ll dig a hole and hide in it.</p>
<p><strong>colton</strong>: Don’t fade away, Grace. You’re still my
friend, okay?</p>
<p><strong>ext. rural highway - day</strong>: Grace has the top down.
The WIND snatching papers from her box. Grace doesn’t care.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>asher</strong>: I’m sorry. I’m sorry you lost your job.</p>
<p><strong>asher</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>asher</strong>: I miss you.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Why don’t you come and see me. I miss you,
too. I’m at the Gainesville Virginia. The Motel 6 off Highway 29. Stop
by.</p>
<p><strong>int. economy motel - day</strong>: The rising sun reveals
Grace has not moved. She is now realizing Asher isn’t going to show.
Grace drops the .45 and begins to cry.</p>
<p><strong>ext. medical clinic - day</strong>: Grace exits the clinic
reading a test result. She freezes in her tracks, returns inside.</p>
<p><strong>int. warehouse store - day</strong>: Grace shopping. She has
a quarter ton bag of dog food. Gallons of spaghetti sauce. Stocking
up.</p>
<p><strong>int. post office - night</strong>: Ten minutes later Grace
checks her P.O. Box. Finds some baby catalogs. A local PREGNANT WOMAN
enters.</p>
<p><strong>pregnant woman</strong>: Wow, you know the question?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Six months.</p>
<p><strong>wider to reveal:</strong>: Grace is very pregnant.</p>
<p><strong>pregnant woman</strong>: That’s it?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Twins.</p>
<p><strong>pregnant woman</strong>: Good luck, sweetheart. Get yourself
home, it’s miserable out.</p>
<p><strong>ext. old private road - night</strong>: Old and falling
apart. Overgrown with branches. The wind picking up. Grace’s truck
slowly navigating the ice. The only vehicle around.</p>
<p><strong>int. grace’s truck - moving - night</strong>: The
accumulating ice is beautiful but deadly. Grace drives with extreme
caution, picking through the ice in low gear. She drives around a fallen
tree branch.</p>
<p><strong>radio announcer</strong>: The State Police have said to stay
off the road unless it’s an absolute emergency. Several of their
cruisers have already been damaged. There is ice everywhere. On the way
in tonight I saw the snowplow slipping and sliding. Everybody, stay
where you are. This is only the beginning.</p>
<p><strong>wham!</strong>: Her WINDSHIELD SHATTERS. Grace REACTS. A tree
branch overburdened with ice has fallen on her truck. The truck slides
across the ice. Grace fights to regain control, to keep it out of the
ditch. Grace stops. Gets out. Pulls the branch off the hood.</p>
<p><strong>ext. old farmhouse - night</strong>: The last remnant of the
once-proud Vanderholt holdings. Grace pulls open a large garage door.
Assaulted by rain and sleet. She slips on the ice. Regains her feet,
finishes opening the door. She gets back in her truck and parks it
inside the garage.</p>
<p><strong>int. old farmhouse - day</strong>: Restored. Filled with
family heirlooms. Another family that has decayed from glory. Grace
enters. Dripping wet. She turns OFF the ALARM. Then hangs up her heavy
jacket. Bone tired. Grace crosses to the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>int. old farmhouse - kitchen - night</strong>: Grace takes a
Glock from her pocket and sets it on the counter. She pours water into a
kettle.</p>
<p><strong>asher</strong>: Hi, Grace.</p>
<p><strong>asher</strong>: Knock it off. You’re not going anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>asher</strong>: I’m not going to hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You’re so full of shit your eyes turned
brown.</p>
<p><strong>asher</strong>: They’re contacts. You’re glowing.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: How the fuck did you find me?</p>
<p><strong>asher</strong>: You told me everything I had to know.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Get it over with. Just get it over with.</p>
<p><strong>asher</strong>: Ever since I met you, you’re all I can think
about. I had a way of life. And I can’t go back to because of you. I
want you in my life, Grace. Please listen to me, Grace. I have a
proposal.</p>
<p><strong>asher</strong>: You become her. I become him. We are married,
see?</p>
<p><strong>asher</strong>: We have the babies. We raise them. However
you want. I just want to be with you.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: What happens if I don’t want to assume this
woman’s identity and raise my babies with a serial killer?</p>
<p><strong>asher</strong>: Grace, don’t be morbid. If anyone can deal
with this, you can. I know you felt what I felt. It’s real.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Answer my question.</p>
<p><strong>asher</strong>: I’ll shoot you in the head and burn this
place down.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You’ll do what you have to do. I can respect
that. How do you know it’s still real? Maybe it’s gone. What we
felt.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: God, I missed you so much.</p>
<p><strong>asher</strong>: I searched everything.</p>
<p><strong>asher</strong>: Damn you!</p>
<p><strong>asher</strong>: Keep fucking running, Grace, you’re only
going to die tired!</p>
<p><strong>on grace</strong>: Running. Batting away ice-covered
branches. Drenched with sleet. Hypothermic conditions.</p>
<p><strong>ext. old private road - night</strong>: Grace emerges from
the woods. Running along the icy road. She slips and falls. Cuts her
hand on the ice. Grace stands, and keeps running, her hand bleeding, the
knife getting slippery.</p>
<p><strong>on asher</strong>: Gaining on her. Grace slips again,
scrabbling on the ice, trying to keep moving. A slow motion nightmare.
Here comes Asher. No mercy. He aims the gun at her face…</p>
<p><strong>asher</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Better you than me, asshole.</p>
