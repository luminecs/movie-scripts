<p><strong>moving quickly through the party to an open office
door.</strong>: Arriving just in time for the door to SLAM in our
face.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: I’m working, Stewart.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: Come on, take a break. I’ve got Kahlua…</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Cassidy Daley. Talk to me.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: It’s Jimmy. Tell me you love me.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Depends on what you got.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I’ve got a confirmed place and time.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: I love you! So, when? Where?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You think I’m gonna say this shit over the
phone? I could get killed. Just meet me at the usual place. Oh, and
Cass? This one’s gonna cost an extra hundred.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: Where ya going?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Hooters. I go there for the hot wings.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: Please. Nobody goes there for the hot
wings. You got a tip.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: You got a hundred bucks on you?</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: Now are you gonna let me in on it?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Sorry. No can do. I have to protect my
source.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: You know what? We need to talk about our
relationship.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: We don’t have a relationship. We made out 3
years ago in the copy room. I was drunk. I was broken- hearted. I would
have made out with the xerox machine.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: Yes, but you made out with me.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: I have to go.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: I want in on that story!</p>
<p><strong>windshield explodes. a man holding a tire iron</strong>:
reaches through the broken window, AND DRAGS JIMMY OUT OF THE CAR…</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Hey, Jimmy, I…</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Jimmy?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Let go of me, I’m a reporter, I’m warning
you…</p>
<p><strong>close on- a newspaper column with cass’ photo</strong>:
windswept hair, head tilted coyly, smile that says “I’m on top of the
world. Beneath the photo, the byline:”CASSIDY DALEY”.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Milo!</p>
<p><strong>crystal</strong>: What did I say about the fires?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: You said “please set fires in my bar”. Wait,
no, that’s not right. “Please don’t set fires in my bar”. Ok, jeez, you
try to get in the holiday spirit…</p>
<p><strong>crystal</strong>: Shouldn’t you be working?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: That’s the beauty of my job, Crystal. Tracking
down idiots is something you can do pretty much anywhere. See, there’s
one…</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: And there’s another one…</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: And there’s…</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I don’t believe it. That idiot. Save my
seat.</p>
<p><strong>rack to</strong>: half a block away, A DARK SEDAN IDLES AT
THE CURB.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: There you are, you dipshit.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Yeah, you. Rudolph. Come here, you fucking
ding-dong.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: We have to stop meeting this way.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Not now, Dwight.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: You owe my boss money.</p>
<p>****: Hey, I owe everybody money.</p>
<p><strong>stumbling around, santa unconscious in the gutter,
kids</strong>: SCREAMING, PARENTS PANICKING. Meanwhile, MILO IS GAINING
ON RUDOLPH, who picks up one of the packages and throws it. IT CRACKS
MILO IN THE HEAD. Just what Milo has been waiting for:</p>
<p>****: I am so happy you did that.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: That man is killing Rudolph!</p>
<p><strong>gelman</strong>: Release the reindeer!</p>
<p><strong>gelman</strong>: Hands behind your head, asshole!</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Take it easy, skippy, I’m just doing my
job.</p>
<p><strong>gelman</strong>: Bounty hunter. Figures. Why don’t you get a
real job?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: So I can be like you patrol boys and sit
around all day with my thumb up my ass?</p>
<p><strong>gelman</strong>: What did you just say?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Milo Boyd. I shoulda known.</p>
<p><strong>gelman</strong>: Sarg, you know this asshole?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Yeah. I know this asshole. Guy used to be one
of us.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Look, Milo, I know this is a tough time of
year for you…</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: This isn’t a tough time of year for me. It’s
Christmas. Who doesn’t love Christmas?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: …and I try to be sensitive to your
situation…</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: What situation? Being a man who works his own
hours and has his freedom and lives the high life?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: …because I realize you’re unhappy.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Unhappy? Are you kidding me, Bob? Look at me:
I’m the happiest man alive.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: That sign is pretty hard to see.</p>
<p><strong>rudolph</strong>: Take me to jail. Please?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Ok, I got one for ya: why doesn’t Santa have
any children? Cause he only comes once a year and when he does, it’s
down a chimney.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: So. Have you talked to her lately?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Talked to who?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Katie Couric, motherfucker, who do you
think?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I haven’t talked to her in three years, why
would I talk to her now?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Well, for one thing, so you can stop taking
out your rage on innocent bystanders.</p>
<p><strong>rudolph</strong>: Talk to her, man. For real.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Do what you want. But this kind of shit will
eat a hole in your intestines, you don’t deal with it.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Hey, why don’t you come by the precinct
tomorrow for our Xmas bash?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I’m not invited. I’m not a cop anymore,
remember?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Fuck that, I’m inviting you.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I don’t know, Bob. I’m sorta busy.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: That’s what I’m worried about. Just…take it
easy, Ok?</p>
<p><strong>rudolph</strong>: You should go to that party, man.
Seriously. You need it.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Do I look like I need advice from a grown man
in antlers?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Milo. Hey. Princess…</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: You’re drooling on my sofa.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: You do have an apartment, don’t you? With a bed
of some kind?</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Heard you shut down 5th Street yesterday. Gave
every kid in the county the gift of nightmares.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Hey, I’m a giving kind of guy. Anyway, what do
you care? I brought your guy in, right?</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: You gonna give me a hand, or just stand there
killing your liver?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Is that a trick question?</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: So I told her, fine, I’d handle Xmas this year.
I mean, what’s to handle? You buy a tree, some gifts, cook a ham, hang
some lights. An idiot could do it.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Well, we’ll soon find out.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: You have plans for the holiday?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: The usual.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Gonna drink some cheap whiskey and put your
fist through a wall?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Jealous?</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Then forget it.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Forget what?</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: I’ve got an open bond, but your thing sounds
like more fun. I’ll give it to Doug instead.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Whoa. Hold up, Heidi. What the fuck. I want
the job, I’m in the hole.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: You’re always in the hole.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: What’s your point?</p>
<p>****: The truth is, I’m not sure you’re the right person for this
job. It could be a total disaster. On the other hand, when one friend
sees another friend stagnating in his own filth, he has to do something,
right?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Hey. I just woke up. I was gonna shower.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Ok. But remember: you asked for it.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Are we done yet?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Is this a joke? Because if it is, I’m gonna
have to kill you.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: It’s not a joke.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: She got arrested? And then she jumped
bail?</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Apparently the whole thing started with some
reckless driving, and ended with her assaulting a police officer.</p>
<p>****: She bit him.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Yeah. That sounds like her. But here’s my
question: why the hell did you post her bail?</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Hey, I know she dumped you…</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Whoa. She did not “dump me”.</p>
<p>****: Ok, whatever, I…</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: No, not “whatever”. I dumped her.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: The point is, I’m aware you guys have issues,
but I’m running a business here. A person needs bail, I don’t have time
to check with you first.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Well, had you checked with me first, you
wouldn’t be out of a bond right now.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: I’m not out of a bond if you go pick her up.
It’s five grand to bring her back by 9am, Xmas day.</p>
<p>****: You’re telling me it’s five grand to go pick up my ex-wife and
bring her to jail. On Xmas.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: You’re a good listener.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: I take it you’re interested.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I love you! You’re the best friend a guy could
ever have!</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Ok, take it easy…</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: Sid, you got a DUI on line one. What’s going
on?</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: Ok. Can I have my gum back?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Right. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: You know what this is, don’t you? Karma!
Payback! You know how they say “What goes around comes around”? Turns
out it’s true!</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: I can’t believe you guys broke up over a stupid
article.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: We didn’t break up over a stupid article. We
broke up because she is a cheating, manipulative liar.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Are you sure you can handle this?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Why wouldn’t I be able to handle this?</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Let’s face it: you’re not exactly rational
around her. I mean, if I was a cop working a case and some reporter came
snooping around, I’d say “no comment”. Not “no comment, but care for a
cocktail”? And then a month later, running off to some love shack called
“Caveman’s Cabin” and tying the knot? Who does that?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: That’s not even close to what happened. For
one thing, it was called “Cupid’s Cabin”. And for another, that was
before I knew how conniving she was. Now I know. So all I have to do is
track her down, cuff her up, and bring her in. And I’ve got, what, two
days? Shit, man. Easy as pie.</p>
<p><strong>lorraine</strong>: You tell him I know where he lives. I know
where his bimbo wife takes her yoga classes, I know where his idiot son
shoplifts after school, so he can pay me my money or…</p>
<p><strong>lorraine</strong>: What the hell happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Milo Boyd. Fucker head-butted me.</p>
<p><strong>lorraine</strong>: Yeah? Did you get the money?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Luck be a lady…</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Toooo….NIIIIIGHT!</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I told you this day would come.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Jimmy?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: You better run, you crazy bitch.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Yeah. He took the job. But if this thing goes
bad, I’m blaming you.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Nice dog. Very compact.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Candygram.</p>
<p><strong>photos of cass with various public figures</strong>: the home
of a successful and dedicated journalist.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Whoops.</p>
<p><strong>now there are footprints criss-crossing the floor, running
up</strong>: OVER THE COUCH, ETC. Looks like Milo had a little field day
here. He is taking a closer look at the shelves: no photos of a
boyfriend, family, pets: IT’S ALL WORK.</p>
<p><strong>“local reporter wins award for breaking up 13th street
drug</strong>: RING”. There’s a photo of CASS SHAKING HANDS WITH THE
AN</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: `Allo, love.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Whoops.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: …so, I heard a noise in here and became
concerned…</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Wrong. Try again.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: Ok, the truth is she asked me to pick up
her dry-cleaning…</p>
<p>****: Ok, Ok, look, she’s working a big story that was supposed to be
mine, and I want it back.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: You sleeping with her, Stu?</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: You mean, like, at this moment?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Yeah, that’s what I mean. Are you sleeping
with her at this very moment?</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: We have a history, yes.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: A “history”, huh? Good luck with that.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Here, kitty kitty…</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Aahh!</p>
<p><strong>landlady</strong>: You’re not Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Oh. No. I’m looking for him.</p>
<p><strong>landlady</strong>: Under the sofa?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Maybe you can help. I’m his girlfriend.</p>
<p>****: You’re LaKeesha?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Yes. That’s my name. LaKeesha.</p>
<p><strong>landlady</strong>: Maybe I should call the cops.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Wait! Ok, look: Jimmy’s in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>landlady</strong>: What kind of trouble? Money trouble? Drug
trouble? Sex- change trouble?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Something like that. All I know is, he’s
missing.</p>
<p><strong>landlady</strong>: I’ve had a lousy week, too. My cousin
Linda fell off a cruise ship.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Oh. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>landlady</strong>: Hey. A grown woman outta know how to
swim.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: I hear ya. Anyway. Mind if I take a quick look
around?</p>
<p><strong>landlady</strong>: Jimmy’s behind on his rent. I bet his
girlfriend would want to take care of that.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: I bet she would.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: The thing is, Stu, she’ll make you think she’s
interested in you, when really all she’s interested in is the case
you’re working on, because she wants to launch her big hot- shot
career.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: Wait a second: you’re Milo. She talks about
you all the time.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: Oh yeah, dude. She hates you.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Oh, she hates me?</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: Yeah. She says you’re the most selfish,
immature, stubborn…</p>
<p>****: I’m selfish? I’m immature? You know what? Forget it. I’m not
even gonna dignify this with…whatever.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: Hey, man, I’m on your team.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: No you’re not, Geraldo. I don’t allow
reporters on my team.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: And for the record: I’m the one who hates her.
Just so that’s clear.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: That figures. Run home to mommy.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Well, nice meeting ya, Stu.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: Wait, where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I’m going to pick up your girlfriend. But
don’t worry, if she ever gets out of jail, I’m sure you’ll be very happy
together.</p>
<p><strong>landlady</strong>: Time’s up. Find anything?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Nope. Not a thing.</p>
<p><strong>landlady</strong>: Oh, well. Don’t worry, hon. He probably
just went away for the holidays.</p>
<p>****: Ok, ok, I told one person about the Xmas Eve job, but she
doesn’t even have all the details, I swear!</p>
<p><strong>mahler</strong>: Gimme a name.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: …and this loser she’s dating looks like he
buys his clothes from Kmart.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Why do you care?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I don’t. I just think it’s funny.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Hilarious. Listen to me: you guys made a
terrible couple.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I know that. You don’t have to tell me
that.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Relationships aren’t about competition, they’re
about compromise.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: You mean like when your wife wants to do one
thing, and you want to do another, and you compromise by doing what she
wants?</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Exactly. Now just get her here. Cause I can’t
afford to lose this bond.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: No worries. In fact, I already know where she
is and I’m gonna go pick her up right now.</p>

wheel.</strong>: Stewart pulls into traffic, FOLLOWING THE CADILLAC.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Milo Boyd. Ex-cop, current bounty hunter…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: …lives in Jersey City, drives a 68 Caddy. Been
in the hole on and off with us the past 3 years. We checked his place,
his hangouts, no luck.</p>
<p><strong>lorraine</strong>: This is no good. We let this guy slide,
suddenly everybody thinks, hey, it’s the holidays! All debts are
cancelled! Get the word out, I want this guy brought here so he can pay
what he owes us, Dwight can break something of his, and we can all enjoy
our Xmas.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: That’s my space, you asshole!</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Happy to see you, too.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: How dare you…after what you did to my
baby…</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Ok. What say we do this inside?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: What happened to the pirate show?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: I got sick of it. Now I’m a female
impersonator.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: But…you are female.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: That’s why I’m so good at it. Help me with
this.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Where is she, Lois? I need to talk to her.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Oh, Milo, where did it all go wrong? Do you
have any idea what it means to waste a woman’s child- bearing years?
It’s criminal. Every month her eggs are jumping out of her ovaries like
sailors abandoning a sinking ship. I mean, I know you were mad about
that article…</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I wasn’t mad about that article. In fact: what
article?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Listen to me, Milo: Cassidy may be a strong
independent woman on the outside, but on the inside she’s just a girl
who wants to be protected and loved by her man. What happened between
the two of you devastated her.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Devastated her right to the top.</p>
<p>****: She has done well, hasn’t she?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: She got to tour the White House?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Tell me where she is, Lois.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Oh, who knows. She was running around like a
chicken with its head cut off, said she was on the biggest story of her
career. Said she was going somewhere to think.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: Dammit.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: No one with that name? What about a casino?
Nothing? Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Jimmy?</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: No, who’s Jimmy?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Look, Stewart, I’m busy.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: Ok. Where are you, by the way? I mean,
exactly.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: I’m in Miami, if you must know. I’m on the
beach building a sand castle and drinking from a coconut…</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Hello, Cass.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Hello, Milo.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Fancy meeting you here.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Yeah. Fancy that.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: How are you?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Fine. You?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Swell. Nice day.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Bright.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Brisk.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Crisp.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Invigorating.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: “Building a sand castle, drinking from a
coconut”. Man, once a liar, always a liar.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: You know what? I don’t have time for this, I’m
working.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Working? Hey, me too.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Congratulations. Move your leg.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: What I do is, I track down criminals. People
who jumped bail. Idiots who decided to go on the run after biting police
officers. I find them, and I take them to jail.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Now, hold on just a second, Milo…</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Tell you what: I’ll give you more than a
second. I’ll give you 10. For old times sake.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: 10…9…8…</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Strike one.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Strike two.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Strike three. Get in.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: I’m not going to jail, Milo.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I beg to differ.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Oh please. Like you’re gonna shoot me.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Nope. I’m gonna shoot a cab driver.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Chicken shits.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Ok, look: let’s talk about this.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Ok.</p>
<p>****: Listen, Milo, I’m not sure we should…</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Hey, wait a minute!</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Bastard.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Great. Perfect timing.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Cassidy Daley.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: It’s me. Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Shit, Jimmy, I thought you were dead.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Don’t be silly. Listen: you didn’t happen to
go to my place and find that envelope I left, did you?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: I did, but I don’t really get it, what’s
“Sparrow”?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: It doesn’t matter. Did you tell anyone else
about this story?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Are you kidding? You think I want to share a
story like this?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Ok. Good. Cause the truth is, there is no
story. I made the whole thing up. So you should just drop it…</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Uh-uh, no way are you backing out on me now,
Jimmy. This story is way too good…</p>
<p>****: Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: I’m at the Atlantic City Boardwalk. Actually,
I’m in the trunk of my ex- husband’s car. Long story. More importantly,
where are you?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I’m…</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Jimmy? Hello?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Deck the halls with boughs of holly, fa la la
la laaaa…</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: Sid’s Bail Bonds.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Guess who’s in my trunk?</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: Is that some sort of perverted innuendo? Who
is this?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Aw, come on, Teresa, you know it’s me. Put Sid
on.</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: Sid’s busy shopping. He thinks he can handle
Xmas.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Ok, just tell him I got her and I’ll be back
in 2 hours. I want a bonus for bringing her in so quick.</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: Yeah? I want a bonus for getting through the
holidays without stabbing anyone with a fork.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Don’t be such a pessimist. You still have
time.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Gotta go. I got another call.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Tina’s Thai massage! Where every ending is a
happy one!</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: You’re disgusting. Let me out of the
trunk.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Hmm. Nope. By the way, your boyfriend
Stewart’s been following me. Unfortunately, I had to ditch him at the
track.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Why is Stewart..? And wait: who said he’s my
boyfriend?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Aw, don’t be embarrassed. These things happen.
You were drunk when you guys hooked up, right?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: You know what, Milo? I shouldn’t have run from
you like that. I was…I don’t know. You caught me off-guard. The truth
is, I’m kind of in some trouble and I could really use your help.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Bad news for you, then. I wouldn’t help you if
you were the very last baby sea turtle in the world, dragging its tiny
weak body across the burning hot sand while sea gulls circled overhead.
I’d just pull up a chair, sip a pina colada, and let nature take its
course.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Hey, I used to be a sucker, but no more. You
can cry til the cows come home, for all I care.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Holy shit! Hey, um, Cass? Cassidy?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: It’s Ok, hang on, I’m coming…</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: You know something, Milo? You’re one of the
most gullible…</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Ow ow ow…</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Son of a…</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: NOOOO! Uncle, uncle, uncle!</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Dirty fighter.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Me? I’m the dirty fighter?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Should we…I don’t know…hug, or something?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Sure. What the hell.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Hey. I had to try, right?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Get in the car.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Your windshield’s cracked.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Thanks, Captain Obvious.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: And you look like shit, Milo. What have you
been doing, sleeping on the floor?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I enjoy sleeping on the floor. Matter of fact,
I love sleeping on the floor. I love everything about my life. Great
job, good friends, hot girlfriend…</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: You have a girlfriend?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Yes I do.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Really? What’s her name?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Teresa. Rocking hot body. Likes to cook pasta
for me and perform strip- teases.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Wow. Is she missing a chromosome?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Oh, she has all her chromosomes, believe you
me.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Well, my life is great, too.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I can tell. You and Stewart make a great
couple, by the way. You and me made a terrible couple. But you two? Like
peas in a pod.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: You know what I like about Stewart?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I can’t imagine.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: He’s not you.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Not even on his best day.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Or his worst.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I’ll bet he has a lot of those.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Still betting, huh?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: You can’t win if you don’t play.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Or, in your case, even if you do.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I win all the time.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Really? I hadn’t noticed.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: You know what? Seeing as how I’m about to come
into five grand…</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I think I’ll do a little betting right
now.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Don’t you have to take me back?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Please. I have two days. A monkey could get
you back in two days.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Aren’t you afraid I’ll get away?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: Damn, I’m good!</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Merry Xmas, Mr Boyd!</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: What a nice surprise! Let’s hope your luck is
better today.</p>
<p>****: Sure, if there’s such a thing as better than great, which is
how my luck has been lately. Great.</p>
<p>****: Oh. Yes sir. Of course. My mistake.</p>
<p><strong>lorraine</strong>: The idiot just showed up at Bally’s.</p>
<p>****: I’m on it.</p>
<p><strong>lorraine</strong>: Uh-uh. Not you. RAY.</p>
<p><strong>lorraine</strong>: Go get this asshole.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Prepare to observe the master.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Ok, how about this:</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: If I give you all the cash in my wallet, will
you let me go?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Hmm. Lemme see…</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Nope. Guess not.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Hit me.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: I’d really like to.</p>
<p><strong>dealer</strong>: Dealer wins.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Nice going, master.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: And for the couple over here?</p>
<p>****: We’re not a couple.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Why would you think we were a couple?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: We used to be together. Back when I was young
and foolish.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: And I was confused.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: And I was slumming.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: And I was drunk.</p>
<p>****: Great story. I have to get back to work now.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Wait. Champagne! I’m celebrating.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Look, Milo, the truth is…my Mom is in the
hospital.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Oh? Old Lois not feeling up to par?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: She might be really sick. That’s why I had to
jump bail.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Taking care of her, huh? Putting aside your
career for a loved one? Golly, that’s so you.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: You’ve already been to see her.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Impressive. No wonder you got all those
awards. So lemme guess: the real reason you jumped bail is cause you’re
on a story.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Stewart. Stewart told you.</p>
<p>****: I would have figured it out on my own, trust me.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: I wouldn’t trust you if you were the last man
alive.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: You think about that much? Me being the last
man alive? Am I naked in this fantasy?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Ok, you’re right. I’m on a story. A very
important story. It just so happens that I’m possibly about to uncover a
whole ring of dirty cops.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Please. Isn’t the whole “dirty cop” thing kind
of old? Maybe you should do a story about something people are
interested in. Like internet porn. Or lesbians.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: I’m serious, Milo. This is gonna be big. And
here’s what I’m willing to do : I’m willing to credit you in the
article.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Oh, sure, like you credited me in the 13th
Street Article?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Why on earth would I have credited you? I
worked my ass off for that story.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: That’s one way of putting it.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: What’s that supposed to mean?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Forget it. I don’t want to be in your article.
In fact, I would rather eat a bowl of broken glass than have my name in
any way associated with one of your lousy articles…</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Fine. Forget I mentioned it.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I already have.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: I mean, you’re not a cop anymore, right? What
do you care if people were murdered?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Please. Nobody was murdered.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Just my source.</p>
<p>****: Oh yeah? How? Bullet to the back of the head?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Dumped in a reservoir?</p>
<p>****: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Car accident?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Ok, ok, maybe he wasn’t murdered yet. But I
wouldn’t be surprised if…</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Maybe this whole thing sounds like no big deal
to you…</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: You know what it sounds like? It sounds like
you’re going to jail.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Milo, listen, you have to believe me, come on,
you know me…</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Exactly! I do know you. Which means I know you
are a deceptive, cold- hearted bitch who is going to jail where she
belongs.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Champagne. So. What are we
celebrating?</p>
<p>****: I have to use the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Alrightee, then. Cheers.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Can I have some privacy, please?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I’m gonna have to frisk you.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Get it over with, then.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: You gain a little weight?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: You lose a little hair?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Yeah. Right. I’m hiding a weapon in my
breasts.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Make it quick.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: Shit, man, you startled me. Can I help
you?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Night-night.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: You almost done in there?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: “Put open end in direct contact with skin.
Press button…”</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Hello? Ok, that’s long enough, I’m coming
in…</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Sorry…</p>
<p><strong>rack to- several yards away, the person she bumped into
is</strong>: STARING AFTER HER. IT’S MAHLER. Mahler compares her to the
newspaper photo he is holding. Yup: THAT’S HER.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Need a lift?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: He says we made a terrible couple. Which is
true. I know that. I’m the one who thought that first. I’m the one who
came up with that. The fact is, I don’t want to be with someone who
can’t admit he was wrong.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: So you’re available.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Available for what?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: I have a waterbed in my trailer.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: I hope you don’t think you’re telling me
something that interests me.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: You know what I want for Xmas?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: You better run.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Hey, it’s locked!</p>
<p>****: I know.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Open the door, you son of a bitch!</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Uh-oh…</p>
<p><strong>lorraine</strong>: Ray’s got something to show you.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Merry Xmas.</p>
<p><strong>lorraine</strong>: Pick something and break it.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: Whoa, wait just a minute…</p>
<p><strong>lorraine</strong>: Feel better?</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: You know, I do feel better. Who is this guy,
anyway?</p>
<p><strong>lorraine</strong>: Milo Boyd.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: That’s not Milo Boyd.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: He was in Milo Boyd’s Cadillac.</p>
<p><strong>lorraine</strong>: Both of you go this time, and make sure
you get the right guy. I don’t have time for this shit.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: What about me?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Clever. Wow. You were gonna use all that stuff
on me?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: A guy can dream, can’t he?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Ok, look, Milo, let’s just clear the air, Ok?
So maybe it was a mistake, thinking we could be involved while working
on the same case…</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Hey, I know it was a mistake. Don’t think
you’re telling me something I don’t know, cause you’re not.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Ok. Fine. But can we just put aside our
differences for two seconds? Because back at the casino, I think I saw
someone following me.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Sure that wasn’t me?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: I don’t think so. This guy was lacking your
trademark smell of booze and KFC.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Ha ha.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Anywho. If these dirty cops have my source
hostage somewhere…</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: What’s so funny?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: You think dirty cops are trying to kill you?
Look, I know you think you’re hot shit and everything, but I’m pretty
sure the only one around here who might want to kill you is me.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Oh no.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Behind us. It’s him. The guy I saw back at the
casino.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Yeah? He doesn’t look like a cop to me.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Speed up!</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Would you just calm down for a second and…</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Jesus christ…</p>
<p><strong>milo grips the wheel as the car starts to drag and
lose</strong>: GROUND. Cass is hunched over in the passenger seat,
excited and frightened at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: I told you they were trying to kill me!</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Yeah, well, no one’s killing you until I get
you to jail.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: You’re still taking me to jail? But it’s the
cops who are after me.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: First of all: that guy was not a cop. Second
of all, we just left him unconscious in a ditch. You’ll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: But…this is important! This is my job!</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: And this… is my job.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Milo, you don’t understand what’s going
on!</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I’ll lay it out for you: some loser with a
minor sheet calls you up and says, hey, I’ve got a big story for you,
you interested? It’ll only cost you a couple hundred bucks, and I’ll tip
you onto some criminal activity, it’s your chance to expose some bad
guys and write the story of your life. Then the moron gets himself
caught, he’s probably in cold storage somewhere, and now you think the
bad guys are after you. See? I get it. I just don’t care.</p>
<p>****: If only I knew exactly when and where this deal was going down.
Course, if I can’t figure out that part, then you definitely can’t
figure out that part, because we both know I’m much smarter than
you.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Please. My brain can dance circles around your
brain.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: I don’t even know what that means.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Case closed.</p>
<p>****: Fine. Guess we’ll never know.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: “Atlantic City. Xmas Eve. Sparrow.” What’s
“Sparrow”?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: I knew you couldn’t figure it out.</p>
<p>****: It’s a business.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Casino.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Stripper?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: I don’t think so. What kind of strip bars have
you been going to, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Oh, well, forget it, I knew you couldn’t do
it.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Please. I could crack that story and still get
you to jail on time.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Oh yeah?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Wanna bet?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: You’re on.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I have to make a call.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Hey. Aren’t you going to uncuff me?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Why? You going somewhere?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Um…no.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Then you don’t need to be uncuffed.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Asshole.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: So there’s just gonna be a little delay…</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: I don’t get it. Why are you helping her?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: But that’s the beauty of it, Sid, I’m not
helping her, she only thinks I’m helping her.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Yeah? If you’re not helping her, what are you
doing?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: What is he up to?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I’ll tell you what I’m doing: I’m gonna crack
this case first, and I’m gonna take all the credit. Who knows, maybe
I’ll even get my job back….</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: You are so full of shit. You don’t want your
job back. You just want to prove you’re smarter than she is.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I am smarter than she is. I would have cracked
that 13th Street case way before she did if she hadn’t…</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: …cheated, right, I know, you’ve told me a
million times. Did it ever occur to you that a normal couple wouldn’t
compete the way you guys do in the first place?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: This from the man currently trying to prove to
his wife he can handle Xmas.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: I can handle Xmas!</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Just..trust me, Ok?</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Do I have a choice?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: So. Atlantic City. Xmas Eve…</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: …so what exactly are these dirty cops supposed
to be doing?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Stealing evidence from property rooms. Then
destroying it, for the right price.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Nothing. It’s just…it’s a good idea. If it
weren’t, you know. Wrong. So. Your plan is to catch them red-handed
before they can destroy the evidence, then write an expose for the paper
and win yourself another big award.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Something like that.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Only, you don’t know what Sparrow is. Could be
a nickname. Or the place where the evidence is stashed. Or a code word
of some kind. But the guy who knows has gone missing, and you think the
dirty cops got a hold of him.</p>
<p>****: When Jimmy called earlier, someone else was there. And they
disconnected the call.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: So we find your source, we find the dirty
cops. Gimme your phone.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Milo! Merry Xmas!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Here’s one: why did the snowman pull down his
pants? Cause he heard the snowblower was coming!</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Funny. Listen, Bob, I need a favor.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Anything.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I need an address to go with a phone number.
But I need it ASAP. Kinda got a guy on my tail…</p>
<p><strong>tow truck driver</strong>: The garage is closed for the
night. Guess you’ll have to wait til tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>mahler</strong>: Guess not.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Pretty proud of yourself, ey?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Hey. You’re a reporter. Great. But I used to
be a cop. Let’s face it: I’m naturally gonna be one step ahead of
you.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: You weren’t last time.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: I said you’re doing a great job.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Ok, here’s what I think we should do: I’ll go
up first, Jimmy knows me, so if anything’s wrong I’m sure he’ll give me
a sign…</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Excellent plan. Oh, except you’re staying in
the car.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: But…it’s my story!</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Asshole.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: You Ok? My bad.</p>
<p><strong>drunk guy</strong>: Watch where you’re going. Prick.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Merry Xmas to you, too!</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Room service.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: What the…?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: What the hell are you doing?</p>
<p>****: It’s my story, I don’t break stories by staying in the car!</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Yeah, well, you’re paying for that.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Oh, ok. Here’s a nickle.</p>
<p><strong>milo’s pov- the cleaning cart being slowly wheeled down
the</strong>: HALL BY THE MAID. The maid stops by a room and enters.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Perfect. Play along.</p>
<p>****: Godammit. Son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: This is like the third card they’ve given
me…</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Take it easy, honey…</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Don’t tell me to take it easy, now we have to
go all the way downstairs again…</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: What’s the name?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Davenport. Room 2505.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: You’re an angel.</p>
<p>****: Wait a second: where’s my gun?</p>
<p>****: I don’t know. Where is your gun?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: I don’t have one.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Then you’ve answered your own question.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Come on, give me something. You’ve got, like,
a million weapons in the jacket.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Hey. These are not toys. You can’t just give
them to someone and have them know how to use them.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: I seem to remember doing just fine with your
taser gun.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Oh, god, is that blood?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Hey. Columbo. Wait by the door.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: I’m just trying to…</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: This could be a crime scene. There are clues
all over this room that only a trained eye can find. And as I seem to
recall, you were the one who was unable to figure this out by
herself.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: He is unbelievable.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Who are you talking to, your imaginary friend
Leslie?</p>
<p>****: Hey. Lots of kids have imaginary friends, despite what my
mother believes.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Whatever. You wait by the door. And I’ll
handle this.</p>
<p>****: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: So you’re saying you don’t want my help.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I’m saying I don’t need your help.</p>
<p>****: Ok.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p>****: What was what?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Did you find something?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: How could I find anything? I’m not the
detective.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Lemme see your purse…</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Hotel security! Stay where you are!</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Ok, Ok, no problem. You’re probably gonna want
this.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Take it easy. I’m just gonna unload it.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: You’re gonna have to jump.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Ok, so some guy you’re looking for has
disappeared. You want me to put out an all-points on him?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: The thing is, Bob: Cass thinks dirty cops
might be involved.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Whoa, whoa, whoa. You’re with Cassidy? Shit,
Milo, you know when you’re around her your brain turns to mush.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Yeah, well, that doesn’t change the fact that
someone took a couple shots at us.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You get a plate number?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Happened too quick. But it was a dark 4-door
Chevy, blue or grey, New Jersey plates, and the car was wrecked, I know
that.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Ok. Lemme look into it. See what I can find.
Just hold tight, Ok?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Ok. But we’re kinda on a clock here.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Milo, don’t fuck around with this. If there
are dirty cops in the house, we all have a problem. So do me a favor:
get off the strip, find somewhere to lie low and wait for my call.</p>
<p><strong>from security of milo and cass in the casino parking
lot.</strong>: Dwight snatches the photo from Ray.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Yeah, that’s him.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Who’s the chick?</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Who gives a fuck? Anyway, they can’t be
far.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Ok. Kill me now.</p>
<p><strong>the sign next to them</strong>: “WELCOME TO CUPID’S CABIN”.
Yup. The place Milo and Cass ran off to and got married 3 years ago.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I’m sorry, it’s the only place I know off the
strip.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: I’m not going in. What if they remember
us?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: They won’t remember us. Why would they
remember us? Just…try to act normal.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Can I help you? Wait, it can’t be…</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Edmund, come quick!</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: Be still my beating heart.</p>
<p>****: Looks like they remember us.</p>
<p>****: Ya think?</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: What a lovely surprise. It’s been, what, 3
years?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Has it?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: I don’t really remember…</p>
<p>****: And you came back! To celebrate your anniversary!</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Oh, no. No, no…</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: What an honor for us!</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Actually, we’re not…</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: You know what? In light of this special
special occasion: it’s on the house!</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Honey? Can I talk to you?</p>
<p>****: You have any money?</p>
<p>****: No, as you recall, I gave you all my money at the blackjack
table… You blew all the money!</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Hey! I would have won it back if someone
hadn’t tasered me in the bathroom!</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: So. Use a credit card.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Mine’s max’d. Lemme have yours.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Mine’s max’d too. What, I like to shop.</p>
<p><strong>milo/cass</strong>: It’s our third anniversary!</p>
<p><strong>dawn/edmund</strong>: Congratulations!</p>
<p><strong>milo/cass</strong>: Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: To begin: a little aphrodisiac!</p>
<p>****: Wow.</p>
<p>****: Great.</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: So tell me: how have you managed to keep the
romance alive all this time?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Well, I’ll tell you, Edmund. The secret to our
success is that the little woman here knows her place. She cleans for
me, cooks for me, and every night when I come home she gets down on her
knees and massages my feet.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Yes, Edmund, it’s true. I massage his feet to
help him feel like a man. It’s important, especially when your husband
has such a teeny tiny…</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: How is everything? Is it like that magical
night 3 years ago?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Yup. You betcha.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: This calls for a toast!</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: May I have your attention please? Edmund and I
would like to share with you the most romantic moment we have ever seen.
It was three years ago today, in this very restaurant, when this lovely
young man here, right in the middle of the meal, threw down his napkin,
got down on one knee, and said marry me, right now, right this second, I
want to go to sleep tonight knowing you’re my wife!</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: And she said yes, with tears in her eyes and
a tremble in her hand, let’s get married, and they ran out to the all
night chapel and came back an hour later, man and wife!</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Can I get a whiskey?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Make that two.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: After we broke up, I was so mad at you, I told
everyone I know you have herpes.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: I told everyone you flunked out of 3rd
grade.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I told everyone you have a moustache.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: I told everyone you like to wear my
panties.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Wow. This would be really awkward if we still
had feelings for each other. Which we don’t…</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: That’s right. Luckily, we’re different people
now. We don’t feel the way we used to.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Right. We’ve moved on.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: We have no feelings about each other
whatsoever.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Just two people who used to know each
other.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Two casual acquaintances.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Feels good, doesn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Feels fantastic.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: A platonic relationship. Working together.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Helping each other.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Trusting each other.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Well. Mind if I shower?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Ladies first.</p>
<p>****: Hey. It’s me.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Sheryl?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: No, not Sheryl. Cass. Your daughter.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Jesus Christ, where the hell are ya, Niagara
Falls?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: No. You’re not gonna believe this, but: I’m at
Cupid’s Cabin with Milo.</p>
<p>****: Oh my god…</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Mom…</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: I always knew you two would…</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Mom. We’re not back together.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Why the hell not?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: I mean, I just don’t get it, you’re in this
romantic place, you have a perfect opportunity to win him back…</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Why should I have to win him back? He should
have to win me back! And who says I want him back, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: I have never understood this competitive streak
of yours…</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Look, the reason I called: I remember you
worked at this one place where they had these bright green matches with,
like, this silhouette of a horse on them?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: That was a long time ago! And all I did was
serve drinks…</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: I just need to know the name of the place.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Charley’s. And Ok, I admit, maybe I did a
little dancing, but how often do you make 200 an hour in tips?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: I gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: I want grandkids!</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Sneaky bitch.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Sneaky bastard.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Good shower?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: The best.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: You know what’s great? Trusting each
other.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I agree.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Time for bed!</p>
<p><strong>music kicks in</strong>: “Silent Night”.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Um…</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Are you trying to seduce me?</p>
<p>****: Yes. Yes I am.</p>
<p>****: I didn’t know you were still so attracted to me. I mean, I
remember how you used to like to greet me at the door in nothing but
a…</p>
<p>****: Yes, it’s true, I’m still attracted to you.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Really? Wow. That’s great news. You know what
would be really sexy right now?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: If we both just went to sleep?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: No. If you talked dirty to me.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Ok. Sewage. Mold. Rotting carcass…</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: No, I mean, tell me about your attraction to
me.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Um…I can’t stop thinking about you.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Really? What part of me?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Just…all of you.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Be specific.</p>
<p>****: My great hair? My chest? Or…something lower like…</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: My gun?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I knew I couldn’t trust you!</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: I knew I couldn’t trust you!</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: When were you gonna tell me about the matches
you found back there in the hotel room?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: When were you gonna tell me you have no
intention of helping me with my story?</p>
<p>****: You’re right. I’m not helping you. This is my story now. This
time I get to come out on top! Karma, babe. K-a-r-m-a. Karma….</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Oh my god, would you get over it already! So I
cracked the case before you did, it was 3 years ago, it happened, stop
being such a baby and move on!</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Oh I’m moving on. You know how I’m moving on?
By cracking this case before you, then taking you in so you can spend
this Xmas in jail, all alone.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: So this is your place, huh? Nice. Cozy.
Probably more fun to sit where you can actually see the dancers,
but…</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Oh. Hey, listen, no need for that, I swear
I’ll be as quiet as a mouse.</p>
<p><strong>mahler</strong>: I know you will.</p>
<p><strong>rack to milo, several paces away, on the phone with
teresa,</strong>: keeping one eye on Cass:</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I’m just curious.</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: No, I do not keep my ex’s photo in my
wallet.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: What’s the problem now?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: No problem…</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: She keeps their wedding photo in her wallet.
He wants to know what that means.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: It means she’s madly in love with you.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: No, you idiot, it means she hasn’t cleaned out
her wallet in 3 years. I’m pretty sure I’m still carrying around a
condom from 1987. Son of a bitch, Jeremy, don’t eat things you find on
the floor.</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: I think it means she loves him.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Really? Cause it did make me wonder…</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Why do you care? Listen to me: you hate this
girl, remember? You drank yourself out of a job over this girl.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I quit my job.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: You were fired.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I quit by getting myself fired.</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: Are you sleeping with her?</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Teresa, get off the line. I knew I should have
sent Doug. Milo, do me a favor. Don’t call me again until you get her to
jail.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: What was that about?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Nothing. I had her add mayo to your burger. I
remember you like that.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Oh. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Ok, look: I know you’re probably upset that
you’re not gonna get the story. But a person can’t win every time,
right?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Depends on the person.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Whadya mean?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Well, if the person you’re referring to is
you, I agree: you can’t win every time.</p>
<p>****: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: This burger…</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: One day stuff like that is gonna kill ya. Who
knows? Maybe even today.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: My tug…is thwelling… I tink dere might be
sesame…</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Yeah, I had her add that with the mayo. Is
that bad? Oh wait, you’re violently allergic to sesame. Whoops. My
bad.</p>
<p><strong>milo’s face is turning bright red. he gasps for air.
he</strong>: SLOWLY SLIDES OFF HIS CHAIR ONTO THE FLOOR. Cass calmly
reaches across the table, taking his keys and unhandcuffing herself.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: You know what that is? “Karma”. Oh, and, I’ll
get the story. Watch me.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: 911? Yeah, there’s a guy here about to go into
anaphylactic shock. Better hurry.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Yeah, “Charley’s”. On the boardwalk? Great.
Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>emt</strong>: Relax. That was an adrenaline shot.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I don’t believe it. She tried to kill me.</p>
<p><strong>emt</strong>: No one tried to kill you, buddy. You just need
to be more careful about what you eat.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Thanks. Great tip.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Know where this place is?</p>
<p><strong>emt</strong>: Sure. Charley’s, on the boardwalk. And just
FYI: when they say “don’t touch” the dancers, they mean with with any
part of your body, not just your hands.</p>
<p>****: Thanks for the ride, by the way.</p>
<p>****: Jimmy?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Untie me, quick, that psychopath is gonna be
back here any second…</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: So what the hell is “Sparrow”?</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: I have a better question…</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Where the fuck is Milo?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You know what? I think I’ll get a real job.
Work at Kinko’s. Or Burger King. That doesn’t sound so bad anymore…</p>
<p>****: Hey. Who the fuck are you?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Nobody.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Right. So what the fuck are you doing in this
car?</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Run, you jackass.</p>
<p>****: What do you want, you crazy bitch?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: What kind of asshole runs up a gambling debt
with a bunch of Neanderthals…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: That’s not what I told you to say.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: As you can see: we have your girlfriend.</p>
<p>****: And I’m not his girlfriend.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Oh, she’s my girlfriend alright. But fair is
fair: you guys can keep her.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I think he hung up.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: He what?</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Gimme that.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Hello, Lucky’s Libations!</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Look, Milo, I don’t think you understand:
we’re gonna hurt her.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Oh, I understand, alright, and I don’t blame
ya. I want to hurt her all the time.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Milo, listen, they’re not kidding, Ok?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Ok. Fine. Say you were wrong.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: For what? For poisoning me with sesame and
almost killing me!</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Ok. Maybe that was not the best…</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Say you were wrong.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: I could have found a more mature…</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Say you were wrong.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: I was possibly out of line…</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Say you were wrong.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Ok, ok, I was wrong!</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Ok. Now. Admit that the only reason you were
able to crack that case three years ago was because you looked through
my files.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I think I’ll hang up now…</p>
<p>****: Ok, Ok. I looked through your files. Are you happy?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Thrilled. Now tell them I’ll be there in 20
minutes. Meanwhile, stop shifting in your seat like that and just tell
them you have to use the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Don’t look around. Just do it.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: You boys mind if I use the ladies room?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: You know what my mistake was? I never should
have let you out of the trunk. I’m fine, by the way. The doctor said I
may have been technically dead for a few seconds, but I’m fine now.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: So that’s what you really think? That I stole
information from you?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: It’s not what I think, it’s what I know. How
else did you beat me?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Did it ever occur to you that I just might be
good at my job?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: That’s what I thought. You know what, Milo?
You’re an even bigger asshole than I previously suspected, and you
deserve everything that’s happened to you. And everything that’s about
to happen to you.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: You wouldn’t…</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Wow. You always carry this much gear?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Only during the holidays.</p>
<p><strong>mahler</strong>: Remember me?</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: What the fuck?</p>
<p><strong>dancer</strong>: Lapdance?</p>
<p><strong>dancer</strong>: Maybe I should come back later…</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Get off the car, Milo.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Get off the car, you psychopath.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Oh, I am a psychopath, and you know why? Cause
you made me that way. And if I’m going crazy, I’m taking you with
me.</p>
<p><strong>bystander</strong>: It was an old Cadillac, this crazy girl
driving, and the guy was like, on the roof…</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What the fuck are you doing? I thought I told
you to lie low.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I was lying low…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Yeah? Then how is it that a statewide
all-points was just put out on the two of you?</p>
<p>****: It’s a long story.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Ok, look, you guys better come to me, I’ll
protect you til we figure this out. Can you get to Pier 19?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Get in.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: So, these guys have a bunch of stolen evidence
stashed somewhere in Atlantic City…</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: And we think they’re ditching it tonight.</p>
<p>****: You know, if I was them, I’d store the evidence on a boat,
drive the boat about 30 miles out, and blow the whole thing up.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Hey, man. I got mouths to feed.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Aw. That’s what all the dirty cops say.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You’ve always been such a stubborn asshole,
Milo. You just don’t listen. All you had to do was stay where I told you
and none of this would have happen. Now the two of you are gonna have to
go down with the boat.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Ok. Guess that’s it. Gotta go. You know what?
You guys make a great couple.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: What’s so funny?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: My mom was worried I wouldn’t have plans for
Xmas Eve.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Hey, are you crying?</p>
<p>****: No. I’m not…</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Ok, just don’t…</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: I’m not crying.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I know you’re not.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: I just… I can’t believe I going to die by
being blown up and sinking to the bottom of the ocean with someone who
thinks I’m a total liar.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: We’re not gonna die.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Oh yeah? What’s the plan?</p>
<p>****: Well…</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Ok. Here’s what we do. We’re going to
synchronize our efforts in order to cross the room and manipulate the
bomb out of the room and into the water in order to diffuse the
explosive impact.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: You mean we’re going to throw the bomb out the
window?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Uh, yeah. Or we can just wait to get blown
up.</p>
<p>****: I’m with you. Go, team, go.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: That’s the spirit. Ok, first we’re going
sideways: to the left…</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Ok. My left this time…</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Now we’re gonna work our way over to the
bomb.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: And I don’t think you’re a total liar, but in
my own defense, I was one of the top detectives in my division, I had
been working that case for months, and then you just waltzed in and
solved it.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: I didn’t just “waltz in”. You know I had been
working it for months, too. Isn’t it possible that we’re both good at
our jobs, and I just happened to come out ahead?</p>
<p>****: Oh. Well, I… Look, I was confused, I had never been in love
before!</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Well, neither had I!</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Ow…</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Shit..</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Dammit…</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Milo?</p>
<p>****: I’m Ok. Ok, we need to turn to the right, and wait for the next
wave.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: My right.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: So. You were in love with me?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Of course I was in love with you, why do you
think I married you?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Oh. My. God. You think I married you so I
could get info on the case? Who am I, Mata Hari?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: She’s a spy, Milo.</p>
<p>****: I know that. Everybody knows that. Mata Hari the spy.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Well. It might be a little late for this.
But…nice job on the article.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: You know, if I had something sharp right now,
I would stab you.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: No, really, I mean, it was well- written
and…</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Can you just get us out of here, please?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Umph…</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Ughh…</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Son of a…</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Ow…</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Can you see the bomb?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Uh, yeah. I can see the bomb. Now we get
up.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Did you throw it?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Not exactly.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Well, what are you waiting for?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I’m waiting for a pig to fly in here and grab
it.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Milo…</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Ok, Ok. Um, on 3, I need you to jump.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: You know: “jump, jump, jump around, jump.”</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Are you serious?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: No. I’m fucking with you. For fun. Just for my
own personal enjoyment…</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Ok, Ok.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Ok: 1, 2, 3…</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Think the water defused it?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Lemme ask you this? Has anything gone our way
yet?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Nice job.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Hey. You, too.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Now lets find something to cut these ropes
off…</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Think we can catch that cop?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Trust me: we can definitely catch that
cop.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Hey, Bobby. I got one for ya…</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: What’s the difference between a snowman and a
snowwoman? The spark plug.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Merry Xmas. I got you this.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: You shouldn’t have.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Hey. I’ve still got three hours to get you to
jail. Looks like I’m gonna win that bet after all.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: You have got to be kidding me.</p>
<p>****: I’m not going without a fight.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Yeah. I’m getting that.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: 9am. See? Easy as pie. Go on, say it.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: I’d like to turn myself in. Though I didn’t do
anything wrong…</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Stop talking.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: …and I was unjustly arrested…</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: See ya.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Oh. Ok.</p>
<p><strong>gelman</strong>: Hey. It’s that jerk-off bounty hunter.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Ah, what the hell.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Oh my god, what happened?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Hey. I couldn’t let you spend Xmas alone.
Besides, I didn’t really have any plans other than drinking some cheap
whiskey and putting my fist through a wall.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: I’m touched that you would give that up for
me.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Hey. It’s the kind of guy I am.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Well, you were right.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Of course I was right. I knew they’d get back
together if they were just stuck together long enough. And thank god.
Better she drives him crazy than me.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: I hear ya.</p>
<p>****: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I love you more.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Well, I doubt you love me more.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I’m just saying I love you a lot.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Right. I know. I love you a lot, too. Let’s
just say you love me and leave it at that.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Fine. I love you.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Fine. Cause I love you more.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Oh yeah? Wanna bet?</p>
