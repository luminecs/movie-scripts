<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Oh, God, no! The hair’s wrong. This is a bad
sign. We really need to get a make-up person?!</p>
<p><strong>ally</strong>: Not in the budget. And not to</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: A hair net? I’m not wearing a hair net. I
just did the hair.</p>
<p><strong>ally</strong>: Health code. In the kitchen or around the
cookie, you gotta have it.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: You guy’s should tell me this before hand,
this is like a huge waste of…moose.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Remind me to swing by an elementary school
after this and serve lunch.</p>
<p><strong>ally</strong>: You’re a thing of beauty. In three, two, one.
. .</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: For three decades the Kowolski Family Bakery
has been a mainstay in downtown Buffalo. Known for their sinfully rich,
cream filled, deep fried polski pierogis. And the occasional sugar
induced coma that follows. Today, in honor of their 30 year anniversary,
Momma Kowolski and her sons Gustov and Vol, decided to do something, a
little bit different. Tell me guys, how did this idea come about?</p>
<p><strong>gustov</strong>: Well, Vol said to me, ‘Gustov, why don’t we
make the biggest chocolate chip cookie in Buffalo?’ And I said, ‘Yeah,
sure.’</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Wow. Fascinating.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: The previous Buffalo cookie record was 3
feet, 17 inches baked by Gladys Pelsnick. But this behemoth cookie
clearly proving that Gustov and Vol have much more free time.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: As we witness the ceremonial toasting with
milk it makes one pause and think. What are we really looking at
here?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Is it just a big cookie or does this cookie
represent the pride of Buffalo? Our dedicated and hard working citizens
the key ingredient, with a few nuts thrown in. And finally, the love of
our families which provides the warm chewy center making our beloved
Buffalo the sweetest place to live.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: And that’s the way the cookie crumbles. I’m
Bruce Nolan, Eyewitness News.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: So, what do you think?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: It’s good.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: It sucks. It’s a story about a cookie. People
with eating disorders will be riveted, Dear Bruce, love the bakery
piece. I can’t wait to vomit so I can make room for more cookies.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I thought it was funny. I love the hair net.
How’d you get it to do that?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: What? I’m cutting that. They made me wear
that stupid thing. I don’t even look like myself. The hair is one of the
most important parts of an on camera persona. Right out of the gate, I
lost the hair advantage.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Oh, my gosh, look at this one. My sister is
so drunk.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Grace. Try to stay focused here. I need your
help.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Aren’t you taking this a little too
seriously?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: It’s sweeps Grace. It is serious. There’s an
anchor job open. This is important. This is our future!</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I’m never going to get anchor doing these
kind of assignments. I want my work to matter.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: It does matter. You’re funny. You make people
smile. Come on, take a break, help me put this album together.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Alright.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Oh look at this. It’s the first day we moved
in together.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Yeah, so full of hopes and dreams.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Oh, here’s me at my sister’s wedding. I
caught the bouquet.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: You look pretty intense, hun.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Well, I was thinking about you.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: So, you’re attracted to me in some way, is
that what you’re trying to say?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You have no idea.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I was saving myself for the wedding night,
but if you keep this up, I may lose my resolve.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Well, that’s the way the cookie crumbles.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Hey, that’s a good line, but you need more
resonance. From the diaphragm. That’s the way the cookie crumbles.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Oh, say it again.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: That’s the way the cookie crumbles.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Oh, I just love on-air personalities.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Well then, let me take these clothes off and
slip into my hair net.</p>
<p><strong>news clip</strong>: I’m Ed Bradley, I’m Merely Safer, an d I
’ m –</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: …Bruce Nolan. And this is Sixty Minutes.</p>
<p><strong>bruce’s alarm clock - it rings</strong>: We are in. . .</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Sweety, time to get up…</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: No, I’m having a great dream.</p>
<p><strong>sportscaster</strong>: …and the Sabers lost another close one
last night. Four to three to the Toronto Maple Leafs.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Of course they lost, they’re my team.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: “And that’s the way the cookie crumbles.” You
know, I think there might be something to that cookie line. Everything
great anchor has his own signature sign-off. “And that’s the way the
cookie crumbles.”</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Oh no! Grace, the dog!</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I’m in the shower!</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Ah!</p>
<p><strong>int. apartment staircase</strong>: Bruce runs along carrying
the peeing Sam with extended arms dodges a man ascending the stares, who
gets sprinkled.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Whoops, sorry.</p>
<p><strong>ext. apartment - continuous</strong>: Bruce makes it outside,
sets Sam down on the grass. Sam looks up innocently at Bruce,
finished.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Oh, you’re all done, huh? B-e-a-utiful.</p>
<p><strong>ext. small wonders day care - morning</strong>: Bruce pulls
up in his Ford Tauras to a cluster of cars unloading kids. A 2003
MERCEDES SRL passes by.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Wow, nice car, huh?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Yeah, if you want to rub your success in
people’s faces.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: What’s with the hubbub?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: We’re having a blood drive.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Creepy. Needles, yech…</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Oh, that’s a nice response.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I mean, it’s just s o . . .</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Helpful and life saving?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: C’mon, that’s your…blood. It’s in your body
and I don’t think it’s supposed to come out. Besides, they stockpile
that stuff. They have an endless supply frozen in a warehouse somewhere
then tell everyone there’s a shortage.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: They do not. Now stop it. I’m giving. I have
a very rare blood type, AB positive.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Well, I’m IB positive. IB positive they aint
touchin’ me with no needle.</p>
<p><strong>o. . .</strong>: h</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Prayer beads. The kids made ’em. Keep you
safe.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Well, I hope they work, cause it’s going take
a miracle to get me to work on time.</p>
<p><strong>ext. highway - day</strong>: Bruce is stuck in bumper to
bumper traffic. He stares at the prayer beads with a “thanks alot”
look.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: This is just my luck.</p>
<p><strong>bruce.</strong>: The meeting’s starting, perfect… Screw
it.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Catch you later, lemmings 1 It’s kill or be
killed, only the strong survive, no guts, no glory1</p>
<p><strong>sfx: siren</strong>: Bruce pulls over, fumes.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>ext. parking lot - day</strong>: Bruce screeches into a
space, races out of the car, bumping over a trash can, goes back to pick
it up, sees a HOMELESS MAN who sits peacefully next to a paint bucket
and sign boards. The various “warnings” change daily. Today’s SIGN
reads:</p>
<p><strong>r ewe blind?</strong>: Bruce looks at the sign quizzically
for a beat, then continues on.</p>
<p><strong>int. newsroom - day</strong>: Bruce rushes through the
newsroom, rounds a corner and runs right into BOBBY, the endlessly
yammering PASTRY CART GUY.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Bruce the goose! Morning, Buddy. Don’t even
move, I got somethin’ special today. My mom made it just for you.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Well, that’s- Bobby, I gotta go- I’m
late…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You like Quiche?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You know, contrary to popular belief the
quiche was actually invented by the Mayans, then stolen by the French.
They shoulda said, “Hey, that quiche ain’t yours, it’s Mayan!”</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Bobby, I can’t, I–</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Just taste it, taste it…</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Mmm, delicious, I really gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: That’s a buck seventy-five.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Can you get Kelly- Ahh…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Oh, two o’clock, two o’clock, two-o- five,
two-ten…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Way out of our league, huh?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You know, I saw them editing your cookie
piece.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: They must have gotten high or something,
cause they was orderin’ everything, I had. Hey, how long have you been
interested in pastry? ’Cause I’ve got an aunt who makes baklava twenty
layers deep.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Bobby.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Maybe you could do a story on her!</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Keep the change.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I’ll give her a call, we’ll talk about it
later!</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Is something killing your kids? Find out
tonight at eleven.</p>
<p><strong>in the room</strong>: The morning meeting is well in
progress. Leading the group is the station manager and Bruce’s boss,
JACK KELLER, 50’s, a constant furrow in his brow. Also in the room:
Bruce’s fellow field reporter and rival EVAN BAXTER, 30’ s , a walking
statement. Impeccable posture, perfect speech, perfect everything and he
knows it. FRED DONOHUE, the ever jovial sports reporter; always tanned,
vain weatherman, DALLAS COLEMAN and segment producer Ally Loman.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Okay, promos are approved, let’s–</p>
<p><strong>ally</strong>: Ah, isn’t that last one a little misleading? I
mean, the story’s about flu shots. Do we have to scare people to
death?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: No, just into watching. Or I could change it
to: “Slow news day, come yawn with us. At eleven.”</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Sniffles at eleven is nice.</p>
<p><strong>dallas</strong>: Attack of the killer sniffles?</p>
<p><strong>ally</strong>: The tanning booth is starting to zap your
brain, you know that?</p>
<p><strong>dallas</strong>: I don’t use a tanning booth.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Come on. You’re turning orange.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: He looks Florida ripe to me. .</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I would have swore I already said this, but
promos are approved. Now can we move on?</p>
<p><strong>ally</strong>: Jack, shouldn’t the promos be focusing on
Pete’s retirement. This is his last week.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Yeah, yeah. Any word on the open anchor
position, Jack?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Evan, you’11 know something when I know
something.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Sorry, Jack. It wasn’t my fault. The traffic
was – You guys already played the spots?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Nice story, Bruce, but we’re going with Evan’s
piece on the sex scandal at the mayor’s office for sweeps.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: And that’s the way the cookie crumbles.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: I’m just messin’ with you, Bruce. See you’ve
got to remember that the news room is like a cookie…</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: That’s great Evan.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Okay, knock it off… Bruce we’re holding your
story in reserve. Now, can we get back to the board so we have something
to air today?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Jack, Jack, hey. Can I talk to you for a
second?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Sure, Bruce. What do you need?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Sweeps.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Don’t worry about it. I called my aunt, we’re
on.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Look, Jack. Hear me out, I’m getting
desperate man, I am pushing forty and what have I got to show for it?
The point is, I’ve hit some kind of a ceiling here. Some kind of
anti-Bruce barrierI And Evan is just lovin’ it, by the way. He gets the
good stories, he gets on sweeps. Maybe I have to be more like Evan.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You don’t want to be like Evan. Evan’s an
asshole.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I can be an asshole.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No, Bruce. You can’t.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Are you going to pick that up?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Yeah, I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: It’s just- this anchor position looming, it’s
gotten me nuts…</p>
<p><strong>jack bruce</strong>: Hi, Susan. Hi, Susan.</p>
<p><strong>susan ortega</strong>: Hi, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Look, Bruce. You’re a good reporter. You make
people laugh. God knows today we can use it.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Alright, tell you what. It’s the 23rd
anniversary of the Maid of the Mist. I want you at Niagara Falls in an
hour.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Maid of the Mist. That’s always live.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Evan gets the live feeds.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well now you and Evan get the live feeds.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I’m going live. In sweeps.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yes, but watch yourself, Bruce. I’ve seen your
outtakes.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Yes 1 You will not regret this, Jack. I will
not forget you when I go national.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Martin, are you eating the glitter again?</p>
<p><strong>on martin - an adorable hispanic boy</strong>: He shakes his
head “no.”</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Martin. Open your mouth. Abra su boca.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Oh, you’re not huh? Well, then you’ve got a
bad case of Liberace.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Mommy1</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: They didn’t teach you Spanish in nursing
school, did they?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Well, it seemed like they were speaking a
foreign language sometimes, but no. Problemo?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Martin has decided to explore new food
groups. Martin, this is for art. Like this.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Is it so wrong to tie them up?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: D eb – Ma rt i n!</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Okay, go rinse your mouth with water. Lave su
boca. Go. I swear that kid is going to poop an ornament.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: You’re good with them, you know. You should
have some of your own.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Don’t start…</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Free milk cow.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Debbie, don’t call me that.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: If the moo fits.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Saved by the bell. Grab that for me, will
you?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Small Wonders Day Care.</p>
<p><strong>ext. niagara falls - day</strong>: Bruce is on his cell
phone, while the NEWS CREW races around, setting up for the report. The
FALLS ROAR behind him and the Mate of the Mist sightseeing boat is in
the b.g.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Grace?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: No, it’s Debbie. The sister who’s life
you’re not wasting.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Sorry, honey. My sister seems to think she’s
my mother. Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Oh, A little place called the winners circle.
I’m at the Falls doing a “live” report.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Live? That’s greatI</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Yep, it’s happenin’, hun. I got sweeps and
I’m live. You know what that means?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Oh, my gosh.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: This is happening for us, Grace. What we’ve
always talked about. Jack practically came out and told me.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Wait, what do you mean practically?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Well, he didn’t spell it out, but this is
exactly what happened to Susan Ortega right before she was bumped up to
the desk.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I just want to make sure we’re not getting
too ahead of ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I totally agree, but in the mean time you
should start thinking about what coast you want to live on.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Oh, they’re calling me, I gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Good luck, honey. I love you.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Moooo.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Stop it.</p>
<p><strong>ally</strong>: They want you close to the falls.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: What for? I’ll get soaked.</p>
<p><strong>ally</strong>: That’s the point. They want you to hold up
this.</p>
<p><strong>ally</strong>: Part of the condition of us getting the
exclusive.</p>
<p><strong>’ ’ bruce</strong>: Lovely. Glad I wore my tap shoes.</p>
<p><strong>ally</strong>: Remember, this is their 23rd anniversary.
Capacity is 59. They cater to tourists, honeymooners. . .</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: And people who are insanely ’ thirsty, I get
it.</p>
<p><strong>ally</strong>: And you’ll be interviewing Irene
Dansfeild…</p>
<p><strong>ally</strong>: …She rode on the maiden voyage with her late
husband. Okay, 90 seconds.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: 90 seconds, going live. Think anchor, think
dignity, Ignore umbrella. Just have fun.</p>
<p><strong>pete fineman</strong>: …but because of the fast response by
our local fire fighters, the toxic chemicals were cleaned up without
incident. Susan.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Bruce Nolan is standing by at Niagara Falls
with a report on the Maid of the Mist sightseeing boat, but before we go
live to Bruce, we have an announcement to make. As everyone knows, after
33 years, our beloved Pete Fineman is retiring.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Pete’s shoes are virtually impossible to
fill, but the show must go on. And we could think of no one better than
our very own Evan Baxter.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Congratulations, Evan. Looks like we’ll be
sitting side by side from now on.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Thanks, Susan. I ’ m thrilled and honored.
Like you said, no one can replace the great Pete Fineman, but I’ll do my
best. I have to say I am so proud to be a part of our local community.
Of Buffalo. I think a great city is a lot like a great recipe really.
Put in some hard working citizens, add some care givers, maybe a few
nuts…</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: All sprinkled with the strength and love of
our good families, that ultimately creates a sweet place to live. Thank
you.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Wow. That was amazing. And now let’s go live
to wacky Bruce Nolan out at Niagara Falls.</p>
<p><strong>ext. niagara falls - continuous</strong>: Bruce stands like a
deer in headlights, drenched, holding the ridiculous umbrella. Ally sig
nals Bruce he’s on. He stares into camera, numb.</p>
<p><strong>int. small wonder day care - same time</strong>: The kids are

<p><strong>jack</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: We’ve got a Walt Disney.</p>
<p><strong>console operator</strong>: Frozen solid.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: He may not have audio. Check his feed, have
Susan cover.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: We may be having a bit of technical
difficulty…</p>
<p><strong>console operator</strong>: Feed’s good, Jack.</p>

<p><strong>grace</strong>: Thank you, God.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Thank God.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: First off, “I want to add another
congratulations to Evan Baxter. It’s good to see what someone with real
talent can accomplish when great opportunities are given to him instead
of me. Anyway, I’m here, I believe with Katherine Hepburn’s mom. Tell
me, why did you toss the blue”heart of the ocean” jewel over the railing
of Titanic?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Did you feel guilty at all letting Leonardo
Decaprio freeze, while you were safe floating on the big door? Do you
think he would have survived if you had taken turns, or were you too
afraid to freeze your big fat ass off?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Did I just hear..?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Well, I guess that’s the way life works,
isn’t it? Some people are drenched, freezing to death, on a stupid boat,
with a stupid umbrella… while others who aren’t fit to kiss my willy,
are sitting in a nice, comfy news room, sucking up all the glory111</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: This isn’t happening. This isn’t
happening…</p>
<p><strong>ext. niagara falls - continuous</strong>: Bruce takes off
walking, the camera follows.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Now, lets speak to the owner. Come on in
here, Bill.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Bill, you.’ve been running the Maid of the
Mist for 23 years. Tell me, why do you think I didn’t get the anchor
job?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Hey, man, I don’t want any–</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Do you think it’s my hair? Maybe my teeth
aren’t white enough? Or like the great falls, is the bedrock of my life
slowly erroding underneath me. Erroding. Erroooding. Errodiiiing…</p>
<p><strong>int. news room - day</strong>: All work has stopped. Stunned

at the building.</p>
<p><strong>ext. parking lot - day</strong>: Bruce carries his box to his
car, when he HEARS A NOISE. A street GANG is hassling the HOMELESS SIGN
GUY. Pushing him around, breaking and painting over his signs.
Instinctively, Bruce walks over.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Hey, come on guys. What are you doin’? Just
leave him alone.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Yeah, you’d better keep walkin’.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: B-e-a-utiful.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Get a clue, buddy.</p>
<p><strong>int. bruce and grace’s apartment - night</strong>: Bruce is
pacing, holding an ICE PACK to his swollen lip.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Thank God you’re alright.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: God, yeah. Let’s thank God. Thanks for
everything, Lord. I am so honored that my horrible demise is a part of
your loving and mysterious plan.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Bruce, don’t talk like that.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Oh, don’t worry, he’s not listening. If he is
he doesn’t care. Have you seen the news lately? We got gangs, we got
drugs, we got corruption. What kind of God lets that happen? Every time
we cure a disease he comes up with a new one! Yeah, is this the lab?
Yeah, it’s God. They’ve just come up with a treatment for syphilis down
there. I think it’s time to release the tainted monkey. Oh, and there’s
a guy in Ohio who’s praying for strength and wisdom, blind him and cut
off his legs.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: So God is torturing us?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Think about it, Grace. God is all- powerful .
He could fix everything in five minutes if he wanted to.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Oh, Perfect! But you’re aim isn’t so good,
I’m over herel</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Bruce, please. This isn’t his fault.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Of course not. It’s part of the mysterious
plan.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Honey, you’re mad right now. It’s
understandable. And what Evan did was slimy and wrong. But your job
doesn’t matter to me. You matter to me. You could’ve really been hurt.
I’m just glad you’re okay.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Okay? News flash: I’m not okayi And I’m not
okay with the fact that you think everything is okay. I’m not okay with
a mediocre job. I’m not okay with a mediocre apartment. I’m not okay
with a mediocre LIFE!</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Is that what you have, Bruce? A mediocre
life? Well, I’m sorry for being a piece in your mediocre puzzle.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Terrific. I’m drowning and you throw me a
brick!</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Perfect! I’ll have the worst day of my life
with a side order of guilt, please. I– I don’t need this.</p>
<p><strong>int. car - night</strong>: It’s RAINING now. Bruce drives,
going nowhere in particular. His frustration is turning to
desperation.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Okay, God. You want me to talk to you? Then
talk back. Tell me what’s going on? What should I do? Give me a
sign…</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I’m right here. Speak to me.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: All I need is some guidance. Please send me a
signal.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Oh well, I guess you don’t care.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Okay, we’ll do it your way. Lord, I need a
miracle. Please help me.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Come on, where’d you go? Ah ha! AHHH!</p>
<p><strong>ext. street - lake eerie - continuous</strong>: Bruce
stumbles out, surveys his demolished car, then looks at the beads in his
hands. He begins to laugh maniacally. He spots the lake, starts running
toward it like a madman, HEAVES THE PRAYER BEADS INTO THE LAKE. He looks
heavenward, challenging the Infinite.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Okay, if that’s the way you want it. The
gloves are off, pal! Let me see a little wrath! Smite me oh mighty
smiteri What, no pestilence no boils? Come on, you got me on the ropes,
don’t you want to finish me off?! You’re the one who should be fired!
The only one around here not doing his job is YOU! What are we, you’re
little pet project? A hobby you tinker with now and again? Answer me.
ANSWER ME!!!</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Sorry, don’t know you, wouldn’t call you if I
did.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Well, hello again 772-5623, don’t hold your
breath.</p>

<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Oh, no.</p>
<p><strong>ext. stair well - continuous</strong>: Bruce runs down the
stairs carrying the trickling, Sam.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: What’s the point?</p>
<p><strong>computerized voice</strong>: Denied that promotion at work?
Is life unfair? Everywhere you turn is there someone less talented than
you reaping all the benefits ? Is your name Bruce? Then do we have the
job for you. We’re located at 77256 23rd Street…</p>
<p><strong>computerized voice</strong>: So come on down, or we’ll just
keep beepin’ ya.</p>
<p><strong>ext. warehouse - day</strong>: An old building on the
outskirts of town. A faded sign painted on the wall reads, OMNI
PRESENTS. Bruce’s demolished car enters frame. He studies the area and
building suspiciously. Bruce cautiously moves towards the structure and
then, STEPS IN A PUDDLE. He SINKS UP TO HIS KNEE.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Perfect.</p>
<p><strong>int. omni presents - day</strong>: Bruce enters and checks
the BUILDING DIRECTORY. It reads:</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You’re looking for room 7.</p>
<p><strong>janitor</strong>: Want me to even those up for you?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: How would I get to room 7?</p>
<p><strong>janitor</strong>: That’d be on the seventh floor. Stairs are
right over there.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: What about the elevator?</p>
<p><strong>janitor</strong>: Out of order.</p>
<p><strong>janitor</strong>: You mind giving me a hand with this
floor?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: What? Yeah, I mind.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Excuse me. Hello. I’m, ah, looking for
whoever runs this joint…</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Be right with y.a, just fixin’ a light. Tell me
if it’s working?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Yep, seems to be. Kinda bright, though.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Yeah, it is for most people. They spend their
lives in the dark…</p>
<p><strong>janitor</strong>: . . . thinkin’ they can hide from me.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Oh, the elevator’s broken, huh?</p>
<p><strong>janitor</strong>: Yeah, but I’ll get around to it.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: You installed a clapper?</p>
<p><strong>janitor</strong>: Nope. Catchy jingle, though.</p>
<p><strong>off. the clapper.</strong>: You can’t get it out of your
head.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>janitor</strong>: Okay, but the boss’11 be right out.</p>
<p><strong>janitor</strong>: You must be Bruce. I’ve been expecting
you.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Oh, this is hilarious. So you’re the boss and
the electrician and the janitor.</p>
<p><strong>janitor</strong>: Nothin’ wrong with rollin’ up your sleeves,
son. People underestimate the benefits of good ’ol manual labor. There’s
freedom in it. Happiest people in the world stink like hell at the end
of the day.</p>
<p><strong>janitor</strong>: Your father knew that. He was a damn good
welder.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: How do you know my father? And how did you
get my pager number?</p>
<p><strong>janitor</strong>: Oh, I know a lot about you Bruce. Pretty
much everything there is to know. Everything you’ve ever said, done or
thought about doin’, is right there in that file cabinet.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Wow, a whole drawer. Just for me? Mind if I
take a look?</p>
<p><strong>janitor</strong>: It’s your life.</p>
<p><strong>full length of the room –</strong>: The Janitor casually
pulls a file.</p>
<p><strong>janitor</strong>: Now this last entry was a little
disturbing.</p>
<p><strong>janitor</strong>: Thanks for everything, Lord.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>janitor</strong>: I’m the creator of the heavens and the
earth. I’m the alpha &amp; omega. The first and the last.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Sorry, it’s not ringing a bell.</p>
<p><strong>janitor/god</strong>: I’m God, Bruce.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Oh, you’re God. Well that explains
everything1 That’s how you know everything about me. That’s how you got
up to the seventh floor so quickly. Well, it’s really nice to meet you.
Thanks for the Grand Canyon and, ah, good luck with the apocalypse.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Okay, I don’t know how you’re doing that, but
I really gotta go. This place is obviously rigged in some way. We’re on
some freaky hidden camera show. …for which I will not sign a release, by
the way! But you know what, I’d be a little more impressed if you didn’t
use the cheesy file cabinet illusion.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Okay. That’s good. That’s a good one.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Okay, God. How many fingers am I holding
out?</p>
<p><strong>god</strong>: Three.</p>
<p><strong>god</strong>: Two.</p>
<p><strong>god</strong>: Four. Nine. Six. Eight. One…</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Okay, how about now.</p>
<p><strong>god</strong>: Seven.</p>
<p><strong>.bruce</strong>: AH HAl</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: AAAHHHl</p>
<p><strong>god</strong>: You’ve been doing a lot of complaining about
me, Bruce. And quite frankly, I’m tired of it…</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: You stay away from me! I don’t know what your
doing. But whatever you’re doing is probably actionable!</p>
<p><strong>god</strong>: Well, that’s not very neighborly. I brought you
here to offer you a job.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Job? Wh at job?</p>
<p><strong>god</strong>: My job. You think you can do it better, so
here’s your chance. When you leave this building you will be endowed
with all my powers.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Sure, whatever you say, Pal.</p>
<p><strong>god</strong>: All the power of God.</p>
<p><strong>ext. omni presents - day</strong>: Bruce barrels out of the
building –</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Okay, that did not happen.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I’m having a breakdown. That’s what it is.
Just a normal, everyday psychotic episode, brought on by tumor or brain
lesion…</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Come on, startI</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Well, that was lucky.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Okay, just relax here. I did not meet God and
I do not have his powers. If that was God, then I’m Mario Andretti.</p>
<p><strong>paul newman</strong>: Hey Mario, did you get that box of
dressing I sent you?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Si, dovete venire sopra per il pranzo un
certo tempo.</p>
<p>****: Yes, you must come over for dinner some</p>
<p><strong>pit crew</strong>: Vete l Ve tel</p>
<p><strong>int. diner - day</strong>: Bruce quickly walks to a back
corner booth. The only other patron is an OLD MAN seated at the
counter.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: It isn’t real, it isn’t real, it isn’t
real…</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Oh hi, ah, coffee please.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: We’ve got a special on soup today.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: No, that’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: It’s tomato.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Alright, okay.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Excuse me I need a spoooo…</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: That’s alright, I found one.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: I lie to my sister.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: And I’m sleeping with my best friend’s
husband. I know he’s just using me but.. I’m just so tired of being
alone. I don’t know why I’m telling you all this. Just seems like you’d
understand.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Take care of that whenever you’re
ready.</p>
<p><strong>parts his red soup.</strong>: A little cockroach scurries
across the table, climbs up the edge of the bowl and walks through to
the other side.</p>
<p><strong>god</strong>: Havin’ fun?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: You- He- Thy…</p>
<p><strong>god</strong>: Let’s take a walk.</p>
<p><strong>god</strong>: Most people want to kill these guys. I’m quite
fond of em’. Very streamlined design. Like little armored tanks. Y’know,
they can hold their breath for forty minutes and their cells divide only
once per molting cycle creating a cytoskeleton with cell adhesion that…
Oh, this is a bit over your head, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>god</strong>: Okay, let me explain the rules.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Rules ?</p>
<p><strong>god</strong>: Yeah, you left in such a rush I didn’t get a
chance to explain.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Well the two extra fingers freaked me out a
little bit.</p>
<p><strong>god</strong>: I figured that would get your attention.. I did
the same thing to Ghandi, he couldn’t eat for three weeks. Now, here’s
the deal. You have all my power. Use it any way you choose. There are
only two rules. You can’t tell anyone you’re God. Believe me you don’t
want that kind of attention. And you can’t mess with free will.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Uh huh. Can I-ask why?</p>
<p><strong>god</strong>: Yes you can. That’s the beauty it.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: This is amazing.</p>
<p><strong>god</strong>: Oh, speaking of amazing…</p>
<p><strong>god</strong>: Since you’re finished with these, I think I’ll
hang to ’em. Might come in handy someday.</p>
<p><strong>god</strong>: I’ll be seein’ ya.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>god</strong>: I’m taking a vacation.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: God can’t take a vacation. Can he? Can
you?</p>
<p><strong>god</strong>: Ever hear of the Dark Ages? Besides, I’m
covered. You can fix everything in five minutes if you want to,
right?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: …Right.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Gosh, this girl is so talented and all they
ever talk about is her hair.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Yeah, she should marry somebody famous, take
the focus off.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: We would have heard it ring.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I know. It’s just that he usually calls
during the day.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: He just needs to blow off some steam, he’ll
be fine.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I hope so. I’ve never seen him that mad. An d
I lashed back–</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Wow, you lashed? You never lash. I’m
impressed.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I feel bad for him. He’s wanted anchor for so
long.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Well, I’ve been praying to win the lottery
for fifteen years, but it’s not going to happen. You know, it’s not all
about money.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: That’ll be four hundred and twenty- seven,
eighty.-</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Zoe.</p>
<p><strong>guy in line</strong>: Come on, lady.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Hey, everybody back-off i</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Listen, I better get back. I want to be there
for him.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: You’re a saint, Grace.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: What can I say, I love him. And if I know
Bruce, he’s out there wandering around with the weight of the world on
his shoulders.</p>
<p><strong>ext. city streets - dusk</strong>: Bruce struts down the
street the embodiment of confidence. He turns shooting a finger at a
fire hydrant, it BLASTS WATER. KIDS run off their front steps, start
playing. A PRETTY GIRL IN A DRESS, comes’ walking toward him. As she
passes he BLOWS A LITTLE AIR OUT OF THE CORNER OF HIS MOUTH and turns to
watch her SKIRT FLY UP.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: And he saw that it was good.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: B-e-a-utifull</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Hey guys, remember me?</p>
<p><strong>hood #1</strong>: Oh look, it’s the hero.</p>
<p><strong>hood #2</strong>: Hungry for another can of whoop- ass?</p>
<p><strong>hood #3</strong>: Your stereo sounds great in my car,
man.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Look, I don’t want to fight you guys. So as
soon as you apologize, I’ll be on my way.</p>
<p><strong>hood #1</strong>: Oh, yeah. I’ll apologize… The day a monkey
climbs out of my butt.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: What a coincidence. That’s today.</p>
<p><strong>big guy</strong>: Did that come out of your butt, man?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Now I’m going to have to teach the rest of
you guys a lesson.</p>
<p><strong>hood #2</strong>: Yeah, you and whose army?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Just me… and me…</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: And me, and me, and me, me, me, me, me and me
and me.</p>
<p><strong>hood #2</strong>: Let’s get out of here, manl</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Okay guys, Kum Ba Yal</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I’ll take it from here.</p>
<p><strong>locusts.</strong>: Bruce exits the alley, the monkey at his
side. He looks down to the monkey.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Back home for you, little one.</p>
<p><strong>hood #1</strong>: NoI NOOOOO1</p>
<p><strong>on bruce</strong>: He belches and one last locust flies out.
He reacts to the unpleasant aftertaste and walks off.</p>
<p><strong>my will be done i</strong>: Bruce poses in dramatic god-like
form, lightning crashes behind him. He is an awesome god.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Well, at least I have someone to drink
with.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: What if God was one of us. . . Just a slob
like one of us… Just a stranger on a bus… Trying to make his way. .
.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: …home.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Oh, my God.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: You can call me Bruce.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Where have you been? You’re so…happy.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Who wouldn’t be on a night like this? For
you.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: These are amazing. What are they?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: It’s a totally new breed. A cross pollination
between tulips and Daisies. I call them Todayzees.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Todayzees? Okay…</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Bruce, is there something you’re not telling
me?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Nothing of this world. Why?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: What do you mean, why? Last night you weren’t
exactly happy with life.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Last night, I was only human.</p>
<p><strong>int. living room - continuous</strong>: Bruce breezes
through, casually instructs the stereo as he passes.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: CD 4, Track 7.</p>
<p><strong>ext. balcony - continuous</strong>: Bruce opens the doors,
steps onto the balcony. He surveys the cloudy sky, reaches up with his
hand and ERASES THE</p>
<p><strong>clouds, like on a chalkboard.</strong>: Still not completely
satisfied he reaches up toward the moon and makes a LASSOING MOTION,
THEN BEGINS TO PULL.</p>
<p><strong>outer space - behind the moon</strong>: Earth far off in the
distance - And with a THUNDEROUS RUMBLE the MOON starts MOVING CLOSER TO
EARTH.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: Bruce adds a finishing touch by
adding several stars with points of his finger. Grace joins Bruce on the
balcony and is taken aback by the perfectly orchestrated sky.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Wow, it really cleared up. I’ve never seen
the moon that big.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: We shouldn’t waste it.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I’11 be out in a minute.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Don’t rush yourself. Sometimes anticipation
can heighten the pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: It’s a funny thing about, pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: It can be extremely pleasurable.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Oh, oh. Oh my…</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Standing at the door with both arms extended
toward the bathroom like an WARLOCK CASTING A SPELL. Suddenly the light
hits him from the open bathroom door and he quickly strikes a casual
pose. Grace stands in the open doorway, panting like an animal. She
dives on Bruce, attacking him.</p>
<p><strong>morning reporter</strong>: In international news, Japanese
relief workers are staging a desperate effort to rescue hundreds of
people stranded by a freak tidal wave that hit Kitamoto City…</p>

More on this, as it develops. . .</p>
<p><strong>int. bedroom - morning</strong>: Bruce lies blissfully
asleep. Big smile, life is good. Then, we hear WHISPERING - Like distant
voices MURMURING all at once. Bruce wakes with a start. He looks around
puzzled, sticks his finger in his ear checking his hearing as the voices
fade away.</p>
<p><strong>angle - sam</strong>: Circling, getting ready to go on the
carpet. Bruce casually warns.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Sam. Uh uh uh.</p>
<p><strong>two hind legs, holding his snausage with his front
paws</strong>: AND STARTS TO GO. He looks proudly back at Bruce.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Good boy.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Good morning. Cooked you grilled cheese.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Oo, my favey.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Last night was just…</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Heavenly?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Mmm hmm.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: It’s funny, but when I woke up this morning,
It felt like my boobs were bigger.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Do they look bigger to you?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Huh? Ah, no, they, ah, look the same to
me.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: They’re definitely bigger. They feel huge to
me.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: You got me. Probably just a hormonal thing.
Well, enjoy your breakfast, I’ve gotta run.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: To get my job back.</p>
<p><strong>ext. bruce’s apartment - day</strong>: Bruce heads for his
severely beat-up junker car whistling “What if God were One of Us.”</p>
<p><strong>close on - bruce</strong>: He gets in, fastens his seat belt,
as two teenagers cruise by on skateboards, stop outside Bruce’s
window.</p>
<p><strong>teenager</strong>: Wow, nice car man.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Well, it gets me from A to B.</p>
<p><strong>master - street</strong>: Reveal Bruce’s car is now a brand
new MERCEDES 2003 VISION SLR. He starts and revs THE POWERFUL NEW ENGINE
and peels out.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: And the last shall be first.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I certainly wouldn’t want to be a fugitive on
the run with Hank, Buffalo’s number one police dog, on the job. This is
Phil Sidleman reporting from The Police Canine Training center. And cut

<p><strong>dan rather</strong>: The body of Jimmy Hoffa was uncovered in
a field today outside of a canine training center in Buffalo New York.
Local Buffalo freelance field reporter Bruce Nolan was the first on the
scene…</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Since the disapearence of Teamster president
Jimmy Hoffa in the nineteen sixties, his whereabouts have remained one
of this country’s great unsolved mysteries. That is until just moments
ago, when during a routine training session, a police dog named Hank
sniffed his way right into the history books. As you can see behind us,
the body is being carefully exhumed and will be transported to a
hospital facility where DNA testing will confirm the identity. That, of
course, only a formality as in a bizarre twist, the body was found
buried with a birth certificate and complete set of dental records. Sort
of a two-in-one for Hank today, as moments later, he busted a local news
camera crew with four kilo’s of marijuana.</p>

<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Prayers? Those are prayers? Why can’t I
understand them?</p>
<p><strong>god</strong>: You aren’t listening, son. Let’s see, you’ve

<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Okay, so maybe I’ve righted a couple of the
wrongs in my own life. I was going to get around to others. I can do
both. I can help the world.</p>
<p><strong>god</strong>: The world? That wasn’t the world, Bruce. That
was just Buffalo, between Commonwealth and 57th. Didn’t want to start
you out with more than you can handle. Now how you doing otherwise?

RAIN.</p>
