<h1 id="what-about-bob">what-about-bob</h1>
<p><strong>doctor 1</strong>: I’ve had the same nightmare three nights
running.</p>
<p><strong>doctor 2</strong>: Come on, David, we’re on a vacation.</p>
<p><strong>feinberg</strong>: I’m leaving my office for summer vacation,
when suddenly my patients rush up looking insane.</p>
<p><strong>feinberg</strong>: “Don’t leave us!” they scream. Then they
beat me and bite me and kill me…!</p>
<p><strong>feinberg</strong>: It’s the worst nightmare I’ve had since
residency. Night after night… it’s terrifying!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: At least your nightmare is only a dream. What
about what happened to Leo Marvin?</p>
<p><strong>a young doctor</strong>: Who’s Leo Marvin?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You never heard of the famous Dr. Marvin?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: That used to be his vacation house.</p>
<p><strong>feinberg</strong>: There’s nothing there.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Grab a strong drink and some Dramamine. I’ll
tell you a story that will send you into Rorschach.</p>
<p><strong>another wife</strong>: Who’s Leo Marvin?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Well, I really can’t tell you about Leo Marvin
unless I first tell you about Bob.</p>
<p><strong>another wife</strong>: Who’s Bob?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I feel good. I feel great. I feel wonderful! I
feel good. I feel great. I feel wonderful! I –</p>
<p><strong>a wife</strong>: But who’s Leo Marvin? I know I’ve heard the
name.</p>
<p><strong>doctor 4</strong>: Was he the guy who specialized in
necrophiliacs?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: No! If you must.</p>
<p>****: Of course I want to publicize the book, Hugo and it’s a
wonderful opportunity, but its my vacation. The Today Show went to
Dr. Ruth’s vacation house, why can’t CBS Morning come to Lake
Winnipesaukee?… Would you work on it?… Thank you Hugo. I appreciate
it.</p>
<p>****: Dr. Marvin, there’s a Dr. Carswell Fensterwald calling. He says
you went to school together.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Fensterwald. Carswell Fensterwald. It sounds
familiar but… They sure come out of the woodwork when you get famous,
Clair. Put him through.</p>
<p>****: Leo?</p>
<p>****: Carswell?</p>
<p><strong>fensterwald</strong>: Long time no see, huh? You have a big
book out. Things are clicking, huh?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: That’s the way I planned it.</p>
<p><strong>fensterwald</strong>: Listen, Leo, I’m closing my practice.
Most of my patients are on the West Side but I have one case I’d like to
refer you.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Carswell, thanks but –</p>
<p><strong>fensterwald</strong>: I know, you’re incredibly busy.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Swamped. I’ve raised my rate. I might even
cut my sessions to forty minutes…</p>
<p><strong>fensterwald</strong>: Leo, I know you don’t like flattery but
if anybody I know is going to win a Nobel Prize, it’s you. You gotta be
thinking about your next book so I know you’ll find this case
particularly interesting.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: What sort of case is it, Carswell?</p>
<p><strong>fensterwald</strong>: Actually, Leo, I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Carswell, if this is a dysfunctional –</p>
<p><strong>fensterwald</strong>: No no, nothing like that. He keeps his
appointments. Pays on time. See him once. If he’s not the most complex
and – persistent – case you’ve ever seen, drop him. His name’s Bob
Wiley. He needs someone brilliant.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Okay. I’ll work him in for an interview.
Say, Carswell, how come you’re quitting the business?</p>
<p><strong>fensterwald</strong>: We’re a dying breed, Leo. Good
luck.</p>
<p><strong>fensterwald</strong>: I feel good. I feel great. I feel
wonderful!</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Carswell Fensterwald…?</p>
<p>****: Claire, if I get a call from a Bob Wiley, schedule him for a
short interview after vacation.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: He’s already called, Dr. Marvin. Twice.
He’s coming in this afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: That’s one kind of persistence. Carswell
Fensterwald…?</p>
<p><strong>feinberg</strong>: Leo Marvin. Now I remember. An incredible
asshole.</p>
<p><strong>doctor 2</strong>: Had that stupid best seller, what was the
name of it?</p>
<p><strong>feinberg</strong>: Watching grass grow was more exciting than
Leo Marvin.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: All that changed.</p>
<p><strong>doctor 2</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: That’s what I’m trying to tell you lummoxes:
Bob.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I feel good. I feel great. I feel wonderful! I
feel good, I feel great! I feel –</p>
<p>****: Hello, Claire, Bob again. Are you sure Dr. Marvin doesn’t have
an earlier cancellation?… Sorry. See you at two, sharp.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Morning, Gil.</p>
<p>****: Overton.</p>
<p>****: This is Bob Wiley calling… Mrs. Patricia Lions please.</p>
<p>****: Lions.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Mrs. Lions, I’m Bob Wiley. I represent the
Manhattan Dental Hygiene Association. I can offer you a forty percent
discount on our toothpicks plus a very attractive selection of toothpick
holders if…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lions</strong>: Mr. Wiley –</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Bob.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lions</strong>: Bob, this is an elementary school.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Elementary school? I thought you were Overton
Cafeteria?</p>
<p>****: No, we’re a school and we don’t need toothpicks.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I don’t know. A young tooth is a terrible thing
to waste. I should know. When I was that age nobody gave a hoot about my
teeth and now they’re terrible! Have you checked out flavored floss?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lions</strong>: Flavored floss?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: All you have to do is dream pink gums, Patsy,
and we can make them happen. Give me your address and I’ll send you our
flossing catalogue.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I feel good, I feel great, I feel
wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Son of a bitch, dirty bastard, I’ll get
you!</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: Help you?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I’m going to see Dr. Leo Marvin.</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: Second elevator. 46th floor.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Elevator. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I feel good, I feel great, I feel
wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Hi… I’m… Bob…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Dr. Marvin. Bob Wiley. Thank you for working me
in.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Your family? Wait, let me guess. I’m good at
this. Harriet, Kenny, Gretchen, Rita. Wait wait, I know I’m close.
Susan, Steven, Andrea, Rita. Wait –</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: My wife, Fay. My son, Sigmund. My daughter,
Anna. My sister, Lily.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Lily… I was close! What a wonderful family!</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Do I call you Dr. Marvin or Leo?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Whichever you prefer. Have a seat.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Call me Bob.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I guess I’m on, huh? Well, the simplest way to
put it is, I have problems. I worry er, about diseases. I have trouble
with toothbrushes. And I, er, I have problems moving.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Talk about moving.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: As long as I’m in my apartment, I’m okay. I
have a phone job – selling dental supplies – and that’s fine. But when I
have to go out, I get…, weird.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Talk about weird.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I get dizzy spells. Nausea. Cold sweats. Hot
sweats. Fever blisters. Difficulty swallowing. Difficulty breathing.
Blurred vision. Involuntary trembling. Dead hands. Weak ankles.
Twitching. Fainting spells. Numb lips. Do you think that’s normal?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: That depends.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: You do go out, you know.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I do?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: You came here.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You’re right!</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: What are you afraid of?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Well. What if I break my neck and become
paraplegic? What if my heart stops beating, or I can’t find a bathroom
and my bladder explodes? You ever heard of Tourette’s Syndrome. You
know, where you involuntarily shout profanity?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: That’s exceptionally rare.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I have a neighbor who got it. Yells “oh shit!”
in church. “Douche bag!” at customers at his job. Pretty funny,
actually, unless you’re the one with the disease. Then it’s sad. OH SHIT
EATING SON OF A BITCH! Just kidding.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Why are you doing this?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Sometimes, if I fake it, I know I don’t have
it. Like, when I think my heart is gonna stop. I fake it so I know it’s
not happening.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: If I can’t make it happen, I know it’s not
happening. I know it’s all in my mind.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Get away from me with that knife! See?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Are you married?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Divorced, actually.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Want to talk about it?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: The world is divided into two types of people:
those who like Neil Diamond and those who don’t. My ex-wife loves
him.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Um.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Dr. Marvin, do you think you can help me?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: There’s a saying, Bob, that the best
psychiatrist in the world is right inside of you. I can help you,
provided you’re willing to help yourself.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Are you kidding, I’ll do anything!</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: There’s a ground breaking book that just
came out, Bob. Not everything in it applies to you but when you see the
title, I think you’ll see that it can help.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Baby Steps.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: It means setting small, reasonable goals for
yourself. One day at a time, one tiny step at a time – do- able,
accomplishable goals.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Baby steps.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: When you leave this office, don’t think
about everything you have to do to get out of the building, just deal
with getting out of the room. When you reach the hall, just deal with
the hall. And so forth. Baby steps.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Baby step… through the office.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Baby step… out the door.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: It works!</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: All I have to do is take one small step at a
time and I can do anything!</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Exactly. But don’t expect everything all at
once. Even a baby occasionally falls and hits his head.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Baby step around the office. Baby step around
the office! Fay, Sigmund, Anna, Lily: Hi fam! He’s a genius!</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: This will give you plenty to digest while
I’m on vacation.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Vacation?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Certainly my secretary told you. As of this
afternoon, I’m on vacation with my family until Labor Day.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: That’s a whole month! What if I need you? What
if I need to talk?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Dr. Harmon, my associate will be happy to
talk.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: We have years ahead of us, Bob. A month will
seem like a baby second.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Can I call you in the Hamptons if I need
you?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Dr. Harmon is quite skilled.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I hear Maine is great this time of year.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I’ll be with you the whole month. Try your
baby steps.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Let’s see… Baby step through the office. Baby
step out the door.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: That’s perfect. Keep going…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Baby steps to the hall. Baby…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: It’s the Catskills, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Bob…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Sorry. Baby steps. Baby steps…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You flying or driving?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Bob. I’ll be back.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Baby steps, he’ll be back. Baby steps, he’ll be
back…</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: July 31, Bob Wiley, introductory interview.
Multi-phobic personality characterized by an extreme need for family
connections. Bill $150 for the session and $29.95 for the book.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Bob…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: It’s your publicist. He says CBS will come
to Winnipesaukee.</p>
<p>****: I knew they’d come to me! Hugo, not to change the subject but
has a psychiatrist ever won the Nobel Prize?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Baby step to the elevator. Baby step to the
elevator.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Baby step to the elevator. Baby step to the
elevator.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Hurry hurry hurry. Hurry hurry hurry. Hurry
hurry hurry.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Honey there isn’t time.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: You’re only encouraging them, Fay.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Hurry hurry hurry. Hurry hurry hurry…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Daddy, would you cut it out?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: See?</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Honey, I told you there was no rush.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Okay, how does this sound? Tomorrow: we’ll
go shopping and clean up the house.</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: Ooo, sounds great.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Wednesday we’ll re-arrange the furniture and
spruce up the lawn.</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: More, I gotta have more.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Thursday…</p>
<p><strong>fay, anna, siggy</strong>: The interview with Maria
Shriver.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I’m having some art brought up from the
city. The cottage should look spectacular.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: I’m sure whatever you do will look wonderful,
honey.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: After the interview we’ll take a celebration
sail around lake, then Friday – my birthday – we’ll have wonderful meal
at Digby’s.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Siggy, are you going to spend all summer
driving us crazy with that?</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: It’s not driving me crazy.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Me either.</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: You gonna do that all summer?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Yeah, dad, huh?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Anna you’re masking hostility.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Daddy, put those away!</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Anna. Examine your behavior.</p>
<p><strong>airport loudspeaker</strong>: Dr. Leo Marvin, pick up the
white courtesy phone. Dr. Leo Marvin, please answer the white courtesy
phone.</p>
<p>****: I’m sorry, Bob. No one’s answering the page.</p>
<p>****: Thanks for trying.</p>
<p><strong>vendor</strong>: Can I help you, bub?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Bob.</p>
<p><strong>vendor</strong>: Would you like a hot dog, Bob?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I sure would…</p>
<p><strong>vendor</strong>: Mustard?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I sure would.</p>
<p><strong>vendor</strong>: Sauerkraut.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I’d love it.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: But I can’t. I really want to but I can’t. It’s
bird intestine and beef brain.</p>
<p><strong>vendor</strong>: Hit the road, bub.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Bob.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Hi, mom.</p>
<p><strong>helene</strong>: Bob, you didn’t walk up again?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I found this great psychiatrist who abandoned
me.</p>
<p><strong>helene</strong>: Did you come here for money?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Mom, that’s a terrible thing to ask.</p>
<p><strong>helene</strong>: How do you like my latest?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: It’s lovely mom.</p>
<p><strong>helene</strong>: Bobby, please!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Mom, I’m sorry! All I wanted to do was talk.
I’ll go.</p>
<p><strong>helene</strong>: Oh my poor baby. How did you get so screwed
up?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Oh, mom.</p>
<p><strong>helene</strong>: You’re the only thing I care about. Always
will be.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Oh mom.</p>
<p><strong>helene</strong>: I’m here for you, Bob. Anytime.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I love you, mom.</p>
<p><strong>helene</strong>: Go home, sweetie. I need to work.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Baby step across the street. Baby step across
the street…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I feel good, I feel great, I feel
wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>becky</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Whoa!… You’re really getting big.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What a bruiser. Hi little Bobby!</p>
<p><strong>becky</strong>: Bob, he’s not little Bobby. Feel the
heartbeat?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Oh, Becky, let’s get married again.</p>
<p><strong>becky</strong>: Bob. You know I’m married to some one else
now.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: But I want a baby. A family! I want to burp him
and change him and… love him! Why couldn’t it have been with me?</p>
<p><strong>becky</strong>: Bob, honey, we’ve been over this. You as a
father? Think about it.</p>
<p><strong>becky</strong>: You know I actually have considered naming
him “Bob”.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Really?!</p>
<p><strong>becky</strong>: Yeah. But it’s still going to be “Neil”.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>ozzie</strong>: We’re a family. We’ll always be a family. I
don’t care what they say about you at school, we’ve got each other and
don’t you ever forget it.</p>
<p>****: Mid-Manhattan Exchange.</p>
<p>****: This is Bob Wiley. I’m a patient of Dr. Marvin’s. I need to
talk to him. Urgently.</p>
<p><strong>bessie</strong>: I’m sorry Mr. Wiley –</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Bob.</p>
<p><strong>bessie</strong>: – Bob, but Dr. Marvin is out of town and
Dr. Harmon is taking his calls.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I don’t want Harmon, I need Marvin!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Look, there seems to be some confusion. You
see, Dr. Marvin, uh, Leo, wanted me to call him but I lost his
number.</p>
<p><strong>bessie</strong>: Bob. I can’t give out that number.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: But you could call him and ask him to call
me.</p>
<p><strong>bessie</strong>: It’s awfully late.</p>
<p><strong>bessie</strong>: Stay on the line, Bob. What’s your number in
case we get disconnected?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>bessie</strong>: Dr. Marvin, this is Bessie at your exchange.
I’m sorry to disturb you but I have a Bob Wiley on the line who says
you’ll want to talk to him.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: You know better than this, Bessie.
Dr. Harmon is covering for me.</p>
<p><strong>bessie</strong>: I told him that, Doctor, but he insists on
talking to you. He says it’s an emergency.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Put him through.</p>
<p><strong>bessie</strong>: Go ahead, Bob.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Bob, I thought I made it clear to you that
I’m on vacation.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I know, but I’m a mess. Worse than usual.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Bob, if this is an emergency, go to the
emergency room. If not, call Dr. Harmon and I’m sure he can help
you.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I’d feel better if I just knew where you were.
It’s Martha’s Vineyard right?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Bob.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Couldn’t we just talk?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: In my office, after Labor Day.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Fire Island?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Good night, Bob.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Hi, this is Bob. Leo and I got cut off.</p>
<p><strong>bessie</strong>: I’m sorry, Bob, but Dr. Marvin just called
and instructed me not to put you through.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bessie</strong>: Mid-Manhattan exchange.</p>
<p>****: Hello, this is Lily Marvin, Dr. Leo Marvin’s sister. I have to
talk to my brother right away.</p>
<p><strong>bessie</strong>: I’m not allowed to give out that number.
Don’t you have it?</p>
<p>****: He went on vacation and forgot to give it to me. Look, honey,
it’s urgent. I’m at: 790-8864.</p>
<p><strong>bessie</strong>: Stay on the line, Miss Marvin.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Thanks. You were fantastic.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Lily? What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Dr. Marvin, please don’t be angry. It’s Bob. I
know I shouldn’t call this way but –</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Bob, listen to me. The doctor-patient
relationship is based on trust. When you call me against my wishes or
pretend to be my sister, I can’t trust you any more.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I know but–</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Call Dr. Harmon, or go to the emergency
room, but don’t call me here again.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Oh that wasn’t smart! Oh that wasn’t smart…</p>
<p>****: Who is it?</p>
<p>****: Detective Roberts. Homicide.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p>****: I have some questions about a Bob Wiley.</p>
<p><strong>bessie</strong>: That was that sicko who kept calling
Dr. Marvin. What about him?</p>
<p><strong>bob as detective roberts</strong>: He’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>bessie</strong>: Oh my god. What happened?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Suicide. We think. Forty stories. Free fall.
Splat.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Now our records show that Bob made several
calls to this number just before he died. Did either of you know Bob
personally?</p>
<p><strong>bessie</strong>: Bob called here trying to reach his
psychiatrist.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: That’s interesting. What happened?</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: I put him through once. After that,
Dr. Marvin didn’t want to talk to him again.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Uh HUH.</p>
<p><strong>bessie</strong>: Wait a minute. Dr. Marvin couldn’t have had
anything to do with Bob’s death.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Oh? Why not?</p>
<p><strong>bessie</strong>: Dr. Marvin’s on vacation.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Ah.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Out of state. Lake Winnipesaukee.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Michigan?</p>
<p><strong>bessie</strong>: New Hampshire.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>bessie</strong>: We’re not supposed to give out the number
but I can call him and…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: That’s okay. I’m sure we can find him if we
need him.</p>
<p><strong>bessie</strong>: God, I feel terrible. What if I was the last
person he talked to before he died?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I frankly wouldn’t let it bother me. This guy
had “sky diver” written all over him if you know what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: That’d better not be who I think it is.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Hello… What?… That’s okay. Thanks for
calling, Bessie.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: That was my service. That patient – the one
who called earlier – committed suicide.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Oh Leo, how horrible.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Oh well. Let’s not let it ruin our
vacation.</p>
<p><strong>bus employee</strong>: This is the last bus to Winnipesaukee,
Bob.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: How many tunnels does it pass through again?
How many bridges?</p>
<p><strong>bus employee</strong>: If you keep your eyes closed, you
won’t see any of them. You ready?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Baby steps, board the bus. Baby steps, board
the bus.</p>
<p><strong>bus employee</strong>: You think you could do it today, Bob.
We have a baby schedule to keep.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Baby step, board today. Baby step, board
today.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Baby step, down the aisle. Baby step, down the
aisle.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Hi. I’m Bob.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Ah!! Would you knock me out, please?! Hit me in
the face, whatever you have to do, just knock me out!</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Honey, let’s go to the store.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Hugo said to expect eleven. Are you sure we
have enough?</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: We could feed the entire network, honey.
Relax.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: By the way, did you call Ted Fein?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Why? He’s a salami with eyes.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I thought he was cute.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: How would you know a boy is cute? Are you
coming out of the closet?</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Anna. Be nice.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: She’s just testing us, Fay. But don’t get
psycho-sexual with me young lady.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Me? When you want me to call some guy cause
his father’s your publicist?</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: Yeah, dad. Don’t be a psychosexual pimp.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Siggy, don’t talk that way to your father.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: They’re both testing us, Fay. Don’t buy into
it.</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: Yeah, mom. It’s not meant for you, it’s meant
for dad. Testing. 1, 2, 3. Testing.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Dr. Marvin! Dr. Leo Marvin!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Dr. Marvin! Dr. Leo Marvin!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Dr. Leo Marvin. Dr. Leo Marvin.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Leo, is somebody calling you?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I didn’t hear anything.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Leo Marvin. Dr. Leo Marvin!</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Over there.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Oh my god… I don’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Dr. Marvin. It’s you!!</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Everybody get in the car.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Do you know that man, Leo?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Dr. Marvin! It’s me, Bob!</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Get in the car.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Hi! This is Gil. It must be fate that I found
you so quickly!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Is this a bad time?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: What are you doing here? I thought you
were…, dead.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Oh no, they told you? I fibbed a little but…
Don’t be mad. Oh…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: The fam.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I think you know, Bob, that your behavior is
entirely inappropriate. We talked about trust. We talked about my needs.
I want you to get on a bus and go back to New York.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You’re angry.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I don’t get angry.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You’re upset.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I don’t get upset.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Then can’t we just talk?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I don’t see patients on vacation, Bob. Ever.
How many ways can I make that clear?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: But you can’t just send me away! I’ve read your
book, I’ve been doing what you told me, but I’ve completely relapsed! A
little time would mean so much. Please.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Bob, I’m driving away now and I don’t want
you to bother me again. You came for my advice, correct?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Then take my advice and go back to New
York.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: But I can’t go anywhere! I’m all locked up!</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: You got yourself here.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Barely!</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Getting back will therapeutic.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Please just talk to me. Just a little talk.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: You’re testing my patience, Bob.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: A teeny tiny talk. An itty bitty talk…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Pretty please… Pretty please with sugar…</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Get up. Come on, get up.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Say you will. Please, say you will.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Bob, it’s two o’clock. Go to the bus
station, buy a ticket home, then wait in that restaurant.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You’ll meet me?!</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I’ll call you. In two hours.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Oh my god, you’re the greatest!</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: But you must buy your ticket and give your
word that you’ll go home. This is all about trust again, Bob. We must
have trust.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I trust. I absolutely trust. I’ll go buy my
ticket. Right now!</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I’ll call you at four.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You couldn’t possibly make it three thirty,
could you?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Bob…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Four it is. Four o’clock exactly. Thank you,
Dr. M.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Leo, you look disturbed.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Who was that poor man?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Nobody.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: He’s cute.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Baby step to four o’clock. Baby step to four
o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I feel good, I feel great, I feel four
o’clock!</p>
<p><strong>elderly woman</strong>: Sonny, your fishy’s losing air.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>elderly man</strong>: Your guppy.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Oh. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>mr. guttman</strong>: Is there something we can help you
with?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Can you make it four o’clock? Dr. Marvin’s
supposed to call me then but I’m going crazy.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. guttman</strong>: Not Dr. Leo Marvin?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Do you know him?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. guttman</strong>: He bought our dream house. We worked a
lifetime, saved up for a down payment, then he swooped down with his
fancy schmancy lawyers and grabbed it out from under us.</p>
<p><strong>mr. guttman</strong>: Stay as far away from him as
possible.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. guttman</strong>: Like the plague.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: No problem. I’m his patient but he doesn’t want
me near him.</p>
<p><strong>mr. guttman</strong>: We’ll show you where he lives.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Take off your robe. Everything you wear is
black. I wish you’d get off this death fixation.</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: How do you know it’s a death fixation? Maybe
I’m in mourning for my lost childhood.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: What do you mean by that?</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: What do you mean by asking?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Come on, get on the board and let’s see your
approach.</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: My approach is to be suave and debonair and
sophisticated.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Come on, Siggy. 1, 2, 3 spring. Like we
learned last time. 1, 2, 3, spring.</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: 1, 2, 3 spring. 1, 2, 3 summer. 1, 2, 3 fall.
Time to go dad.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Cut it out, Siggy. Left foot…</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: This is no fun.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Why didn’t you dive?</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: With all the horror that’s going on in the
world, what difference does it make?</p>
<p>****: Of course I’m excited Ellie. The last person they interviewed
on vacation was Dr Ruth.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: He didn’t dive.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: He’s a little afraid of it, dear. Have
patience.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: It’s not like I’m making him jump out of an
airplane. When I was growing up, I thought diving was fun.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I thought you were born grown up.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: You’re masking hostility, Anna Marvin. Turn
that down.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: It’s full of Freudian symbols, dad. It’s
educational.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: What the…? What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I’m sorry. Don’t be mad. The Guttmans brought
me.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Thank you Mr. and Mrs. G.!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. guttman</strong>: Your welcome, Bobby, Hello,
Dr. Marvin!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. guttman</strong>: Burn in hell, Dr. Marvin!</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: We agreed that I would call you. Your coming
here is unbelievably inappropriate.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Hi. I’m Anna.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I saw your picture. I’m Bob.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Hi. I’m Bob.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: I’m Fay.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Oh, Mrs. M. You’re even prettier than your
picture.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Why thank you.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Bob, I think you and I have some things to
talk about.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You do? You finally think so too?!</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Would you excuse us, dear?</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Bob, may I take your fish?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Anna.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Nice to meet you, Bob.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You too.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Great place. No wonder the Guttmans wanted it.
I really feel bad about barging in like this.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Forget it. I understand.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You do?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Of course I do. Your problems don’t go away
just because I go on vacation. They’ve been with you a long time after
all.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Ever since I can remember.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: On the other hand, you’re making strides.
You got here.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I baby stepped. I owe it to you.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Bob, take a look around you. What does
everything you see have in common?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Er… I don’t know… It’s all owned by you, that’s
obvious. Humm… Everything’s from a garage sale!</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Vacation, Bob. Everything you see is part of
a vacation. Every year, for one month, I bring my family to this house
on vacation. Nice, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: It’s wonderful. The lake. The trees. The little
town.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Do you know what the point of a vacation is?
Do you understand the meaning of the word?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: You forget about your troubles. You give up
your worries. You drink from the wellspring of relaxation that enriches
your soul. Now I can’t, at this time, give you the kind of therapeutic
attention that you need to solve all your problems. Know why?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Er, because you’re on vacation?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Excellent. But what I can do – and only I
can do this because you trust me don’t you Bob?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Why else would I be here?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Exactly. What I can do is this.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Get on your bus and go back to New York.
Every time a problem comes up, follow this prescription.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I don’t need pills. I have plenty of pills.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: It’s not pills. Read it.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: It says: “A vacation from my problems.”</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I’m giving you permission to take a
vacation, Bob. Not a vacation from your work. Not a vacation from your
daily life. But a vacation from…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: My problems.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Every time you feel a problem coming on,
take that out and follow it to the letter. Doctors orders.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Doctors orders.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I’m glad you came. I’ll see you in my office
next month.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: That’s it?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: You came here for relief, Bob. Read your
prescription.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: This is… INCREDIBLE! This is ASTOUNDING!! For
the first time since Menningers I feel free! I knew coming up here was
the right thing to do!</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: It feels right because you’re here and
because you’re leaving.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You’ve given me a great gift, doctor. The gift
of life. You’re a great man.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: If you have any questions, call
Dr. Harmon.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Have a great vacation!</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: You too.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: A vacation from my problems. You bet I
will!</p>
<p>****: Yes?</p>
<p>****: It’s Bob. I forgot Gil.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: My fish.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Oh. Right.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You must be Sigmund.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Siggy, this is Bob. He’s just leaving.</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Hi. This is Gil. My fish.</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: Cool. Did you get him out of the lake?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: No. He’s a city fish.</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: Cool.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Your father is the most incredible psychiatrist
in the world! You better appreciate him.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Have a great vacation, fam.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: You too, Bob.</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: Nice to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Vacation from my problems. Take a vacation from
my problems. A baby stepping, lazy stepping vacation from my
problems.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: It’s too close to the wall.</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: Who cares?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I care, and you should too. Our house is
going on national television tomorrow. You want your friends to think
you live in a dump?</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: My friends would respect me for it.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: You know, there’s nothing wrong with
neatness. People joke but it’s actually a sign of a creative
intelligence. Right, Fay?</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: In isolated cases, sure.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: What is that supposed to mean?</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: The room looks wonderful, dear.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Seriously, what do you mean by that?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You’re incredibly creative, daddy.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I’ll get it. It’s probably the van with my
art.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Good morning! I’ll bet you’re surprised to see
me!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: When I walked out of here last night I said to
myself, “Dr. Marvin’s absolutely right. Take a vacation from your
problems. Blow em off. Just say ‘no’.” So I did!</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: But… You’re back.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: No I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: You’re not?!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Of course not. I’m taking a vacation. This
isn’t an appointment, I’m dropping by. I told the Guttmans what you said
and they found me a cottage nearby.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Yeah, the town is packed but I guess if you
know the right people… Anyway, I know we can’t work but let’s get the
friendship thing going.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I’m a little anxious about being here by myself
but I don’t want to barge in. I’ll call. Give my best to the fam and see
ya around, okay?</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Who was that, Leo?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Nobody.</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: Again?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I almost forgot, here’s your newspaper. See
ya.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Wasn’t that Bob?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You guys up for going out to breakfast?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Eating in. I admire that.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: That was Bob! I thought you said he left
town?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I did. I said exactly that.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: And I don’t want you letting him in this
house.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Daddy, you’re hurting me!</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: What’s your problem?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I don’t have a problem.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Honey, who is that man?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Nobody, Fay. Nothing to get excited about. A
work related problem just went away. It’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I’ve never seen him like this.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: If you want to know, I think your father is
nervous about going on national television tomorrow. Freud himself would
be anxious so let’s be supportive, okay?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: He should go punch some pillows.</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: Or get shock treatment.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Remember that he’s under pressure.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Flap jacks!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Vacation from my problems. Take a vacation from
my problems. There’s nothing to fear, there’s nobody here. Nothing to
fear</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Where are you off to?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Sailing.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: With Teddy Fein?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: No. George Stark. The boy from the plane.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: It’s a quarter mile to the marina. Why do
you need the car?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I’m picking everybody up.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Stay out of the sun! Remember what’s
happening to the ozone layer.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Bob!</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Hi! Where you going?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Just to… town. Buy some…, Kleenex.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Want a ride?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I don’t think your dad would like you picking
me up.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: He wouldn’t like a lot of things. Hop in.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: He seemed pretty upset this morning.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: He’s nervous about the interview.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Interview?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Maria Shriver’s coming tomorrow to talk about
his book.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Wow… so that’s the problem! And I thought he
was upset about me!</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Well he’s always uptight, even when it doesn’t
show.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: He is?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Sure. Imagine growing up with a dad who sees
every stage of growing up as a Freudian passage. Did you ever have
crayons?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Fat or skinny?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Er, skinny, I think.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Uh oh.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Dad saw crayons as phallic symbols. When I
asked for skinny crayons, it was a personal assault on his manhood.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What’d he do, buy a Porsche?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I wish! He just kept psychoanalyzing
everything. My dolls were alter egos. Boys who wanted to kiss me were
Oedipally fixated adolescents looking to displace their mothers on their
aboriginal family totems.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Sounds like my friends to a tee. You seem to be
doing okay now.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Hardly. I analyze everything to death. Every
time a guy smiles at me, I ask myself is he really smiling or is he just
orally fixated? When I smile back, I wonder, am I really attracted or
just smiling out of some residual Cro-Magnon instinct? If I ever
actually have sex, I’m not sure I’ll know the difference between an
orgasm and an anxiety attack!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I have the same problem.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: The kinds of urges other girls act on
impulsively, I analyze until either the urge goes away or –</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Or what?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: The boy goes away.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Well. It sounds like your dad never learned to
leave his work at the office.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Lot of good it does me!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You’ll make some man very happy someday.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: What are you doing today?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Buying Kleenex.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Wanna come sailing?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Well, I… I, er…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: That’s okay. You don’t have to.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Actually, it’s not that I don’t want to go.
It’s just that I’ve never been on a boat and I’m not sure I can handle
it.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: There’s nothing to it. George Stark’s doing
the sailing.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Just thinking about gives me hives.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You’re right, this is great! I never actually
thought I could do this. I never thought this could be me!</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: This is child abuse! If you drop me, I’ll
prosecute!</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I am not going to let go until you’re ready,
okay? Trust me and put your hands out like I showed you.</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: I’m not ready! Do you hear? I’m not
ready!!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Hey Doctor M, look at me! I’m sailing!</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: Murderer! Child molester…</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Siggy, it was an accident!</p>
<p><strong>the guttmans</strong>: Hitler!</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Anna!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Did you see me out there?! I’m getting better
all the time.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I want to see Anna alone.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I thought I told you to stay away from Bob
Wiley.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: No. You just said I couldn’t let him in the
house.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Daddy, where are we going?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Home.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: What about the car? I left it at the pier.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Leave it. It’s been a while since I’ve had a
walk with my daughter.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Daddy, not here!</p>
<p><strong>marvin puppet</strong>: Anna, I know you think you’re old
enough to know what’s best for you and I know you’re at the age where
you don’t want to listen to your father. But as your father, who’s
always loved you, I’m asking you not to see Bob Wiley.</p>
<p><strong>anna puppet</strong>: I don’t understand the problem! Bob’s a
nice guy!</p>
<p><strong>marvin puppet</strong>: Bob Wiley is a patient. He followed
me here from New York which is bizarre. But even if it weren’t bizarre,
my daughter seeing a patient that I’m treating is entirely
inappropriate.</p>
<p><strong>anna puppet</strong>: Bob said you’re not treating him
here.</p>
<p><strong>marvin puppet</strong>: He’s right there!</p>
<p><strong>anna puppet</strong>: So if you’re not treating him while
he’s here, then he’s not a patient while he’s here, is he? And I have
the right to see him!</p>
<p><strong>marvin puppet</strong>: Anna, you’re acting out!</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Bob’s a perfectly nice guy! He’s intense and
sensitive and he listens which is more than I can say about you.
Bob!</p>
<p><strong>marvin puppet</strong>: Anna, come back!</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Why don’t you come in and talk about it?</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Just because your father dropped you in the
water doesn’t mean you can’t trust me.</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: You sleep with him. You’re his spy.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Leo, you’ve upset Siggy.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Leo…?</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: That’s right, go to him! You always do.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Hey, Siggy.</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: Oh. Hi, Bob. You scared me.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Sorry. Didn’t mean to sneak up on you.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Dad’s at it again. I can tell. Another
vacation that’s not a vacation, right?</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: What’s with him and diving? Maria Shriver’s
not gonna watch me dive!</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Leo, Siggy is really upset.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Leo…</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Fay, I’m a failure.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Our daughter, our only daughter, has fallen
for a brilliant manipulator twice her age.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Leo, for god’s sake talk sense.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Anna and Bob!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Face a fear and it goes away.</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: Okay. I’m facing it, now what do I do?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Hit it. Fast. While it isn’t looking.</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: My mind says “yes yes” but my body says “no
no”. It’s hopeless.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: If I’m not hopeless, nothing’s hopeless…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Let’s try something I saw in a pirate
movie.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: For God’s sake, I’m even a failure in my own
book! Can you believe it? In Chapter 2, I wrote that a healthy
adolescent girl can never have a sublimated father complex and my
daughter has one.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: It’s a brief flirtation, honey. Anna’s
perfectly healthy.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Then you’re saying the book’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Better that than Anna.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Fay, my god!</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Leo, what? Leo, what is it?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I’m going on national television tomorrow –
to promote a fraud!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Don’t think about boiling oil!</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Or searing acid!</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: I’m not!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Our Father, we commit this soul to the sea.</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I’m doomed!</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: No you’re not.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I’ll be a laughing stock!</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: No you won’t. You’ve blow this way out of
proportion, Leo, and you have to get control. Now try your
breathing.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Okay. I’m being ridiculous. You’re
right.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: It’s a brilliant book… Our daughter’s fine…
I’m great.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Fay, do you remember a Carswell
Fensterwald?</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: My God, Leo, look at this.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: The name is so familiar but –</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Leo, Siggy’s diving!</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I’ll put a stop to this!</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Leo!</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Enough. Let go of him! That’s enough!</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Leo!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Dr. M., watch this!</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: Watch, dad!</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Stop diving this instant!</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Dad!</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: Ow! You bastard!</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Leo! Look at what you’re doing! Leo, look at
yourself!</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: What are you staring at? I had every right
to buy this house!</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Where’s Bob? Where’s Bob?!</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Listen, everybody, I’m not wrong often, but
when I am, I admit it. I’m sorry. I mean it. How can I make it up?</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: Knocking Bob in the water was awful. What if
he hadn’t known how to swim?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: But he did. I’m not saying I was right, but
Bob can do a lot of things no one thought he could do.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Look, I said I was wrong now I’d like to
forget it. I’d like you all to accept my apology.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: What about Bob?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: What about Bob?!</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Don’t you think you should apologize to
him?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I will not apologize to Bob.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Because I won’t.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Honey, why are you so hostile towards the poor
man?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Because he’s a patient, Fay! Don’t you get
it?</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: He’s not a patient, he’s a person.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: And a nice one.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: I think we should invite him for dinner.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Dinner?!</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Dinner.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Really?!</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: The poor fellow’s devastated.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I don’t want Bob for dinner, Fay.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Leo…</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I don’t want Bob for dinner, Fay. I want to
think about my interview.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Do it, mom. Invite him. You’d be making family
history. It’d be the first major thing you’ve done on your own since
I’ve known you!</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Right is right, Leo Marvin.</p>
<p><strong>sigmund</strong>: Testing 1, 2, 3. Testing. For the next few
seconds we will be conducting a test of the emergency broadcast
system:</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Get away. Get away!</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: Ring around the moon. Rain coming soon.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Gee, is that true?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: It’s superstitious nonsense.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: That looks scrumptious.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Did I do something?</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: No, Bob. It’s fine. Eat up. Leo.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Mmmm. Mmmmm. This sure is good. Mmmm. Mmmmm.
Mmmmm.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Would you please stop that?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Oh. Sorry, Leo. Would you pass the salt?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: And don’t call me Leo.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I’m sorry. You said in your office that I could
call you Leo.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: That was in my office. In my home you will
call me Dr. Marvin.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: He’s nervous about the interview tomorrow.
Don’t take it personally.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Hey, that’s right, I heard about your upcoming
debut. Congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Your book’s going to do a lot of people a lot
of good, Le– Dr. Marvin. I’m walking proof of that.</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: Dad?</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Sweetheart?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Don’t panic! I know what to do!</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: Dad, you okay?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Daddy?!</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Honey?!</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Leo, are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I said…, get him off me!</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: Bob, you saved him!</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Incredible! Wonderful!</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Thank you!</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: Told you so.</p>
<p>****: “I’m singing in the rain, Just singing in the rain, What a
glorious feeling,</p>
<p>****: I’m happy again!</p>
<p>****: “I walk though the kitchen With a bowl full of chicken I’m
singing, I’m singing In the rain.”</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Look, tomorrow morning is very important and
I’d like to call it a night. I don’t want to be rude but I think it’s
time for Bob to sing his way home.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Honey, you don’t expect Bob to walk back in
this do you?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Did I say that? I’ll drive him.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: The car’s still in town, daddy.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You said to leave it, remember? We walked
home.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: The rain’s bound to let up. Bob can go
then.</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: What if it starts up again while Bob’s on the
way?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: He can borrow my slicker.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Leo.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Shsh.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Leo…</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Quiet. It’s letting up.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Leo, we can’t make the poor fellow sit here all
night. Let’s let him stay over.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Stay over? Honey, Maria Shriver’s coming in
the morning. Maria Shriver! You want some guy sleeping on our couch when
Maria Shriver gets here?</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: There’s an extra bed in Siggy’s room. Bob,
would you like to spend the night?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Well I… Do you have a dacron pillow?</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: That’s a great idea!</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Fay!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Are you sure I’m not imposing?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Of course you are – !</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: – aren’t. Anna, find an extra set of sheets.
Siggy, get one of your father’s robes for Bob.</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: Did you find a toothbrush?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Yeah. Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: You care which bed?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I’d prefer facing southeast.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Have you seen my new toothbrush?</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: It should be in the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Well it should be but it’s not!</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Just because you’re nervous about tomorrow, Leo
Marvin, doesn’t give you the right to get snippy. If you can’t handle
the pressure, postpone the interview.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Fay, it’s not the interview – I mean I am
nervous about it – but that’s not what’s bugging me. It’s… him.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Him who? Bob?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: No, Siggy. Yes, Bob! Who else?</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Leo, quiet. He’ll hear you.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Why shouldn’t he hear me? Don’t you get it,
he’s a sick person. A multiphobic mess! He faked suicide…</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Isn’t that a cry for help?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: …Followed me up here from New York, wormed
his way into my house. For all I know, he’s a mass murderer!</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Oh come on, Leo, he’s a sweet guy. Perfectly
harmless.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: You don’t know that! Everything he’s done
violates the patient-doctor relationship. Now he’s in there with our
son!</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: Bob?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: How come you go to dad? Are you really sick
or just maladjusted?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Sick. You ever had a bee buzz your face that
wouldn’t go away?</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: Sure. Once or twice.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: When I was twelve, I had one buzz me for three
weeks.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Whoa. You got some heavy stuff here. Denial of
Death, Fear and Trembling, Sickness Unto Death.</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: Those are dad’s.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: He lets you read this stuff?</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: He hid them but I found them.</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: Bob?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: Are you afraid of death?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Sure. Are you kidding?</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: What do you do about it? I mean, how do you
cope?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Well… The way I figure it, if it weren’t called
“death”, it wouldn’t be so bad. I mean what if it were called
“dink”?</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: Dink?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Then it would be fine. We’d say “Grandma
dinked.” “The garbage man dinked.”</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: My turtle just dinked.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Exactly. Then we wouldn’t worry anymore.</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: Hey, you’re right!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: ’Course we’d still have to worry about
Barrett’s Esophagus and Black Water Fever and Tourette’s Syndrome.</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: What’s Tourette’s syndrome?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: What is going on in here?!</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: Sorry, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I asked you a question!</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: Tourette’s Dad. You know, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Yeah, Dad… Leo… Dr. Marvin.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: It’s kids being kids, Leo.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I don’t want to hear another peep out of
this room. I’m trying to get some sleep around here! Tomorrow is the
most important day of my career! CBS is coming here. Maria Shriver is
coming here. Millions will be watching. And buying!</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: I’m sorry, Dad. We’ll stop.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: We got carried away. We won’t do it again.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I want you out by six thirty. Understand.
Maria Shriver comes at seven, I want you out by six thirty.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Sure. Would you like something for sleep?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I’ve got Valium if you need it.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I don’t need Valium.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Halcyon? Seconal?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I need peace and quiet!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I’ll be quiet.</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: And I’ll be peace.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: It’s my fault, Mrs. M., we should have been
quieter.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: We just have to get him through Maria Shriver.
Sleep tight. Don’t let the bed bugs bite.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Bed bugs!</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: It’s just an expression.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Oh right. ’Night.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Mrs. M!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Would you mind leaving it cracked?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Six o’clock, rise and shine!</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Rise and shine. Six o’clock. Rise and shine,
rise and shine.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Bob… Bob!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Baby stepping down the stairs. Baby stepping
down the stairs!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Hello! Is this a beautiful day or what?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Leave.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I had the most incredible dream last night, I
–</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Go.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Is this something you want me to work out on my
own?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Now!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Well. You’ve been right about everything so
far. God, therapy is a fascinating process. ’Bye Mrs. M. Thank you for
everything. ’Bye Anna. See you later.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: ’Bye Bob. See you later today, maybe.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Don’t be a stranger.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You know me. I won’t. So long, ass wipe of the
universe!</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: ’Bye dog pissing barf brain!</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Siggy! Bob!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Later, fart smelling douche bag! Maria
Shriver’s here.</p>
<p><strong>maria shriver</strong>: Dr. Marvin, Maria Shriver.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: I hope we’re not too early. May we come
in?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Sure. I thought by the fireplace…</p>
<p><strong>crew member</strong>: It’s a fireplace shot, fellows.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: I’m the Director, Howie Katrell. This is
Lenny Burns, our Producer.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: This is even nicer than the pictures.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Is this your family?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Oh, sorry. This is my wife, er, Fay. My
daughter Anna, and my son…</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: I’m Siggy, dad. How’s Arnold? Can you get me
his autograph?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Sigmund…</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: I think I can swing it.</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: Really? Wow!</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Hi. I’m Maria.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I’m Bob.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Bob’s a patient. He was just –</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Wow. A Baby Stepper in action. Neat idea.
Howie, Dr. Marvin’s gonna have a patient on with him.</p>
<p><strong>howie</strong>: Fine. Let’s can the fireplace shot and –</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Now wait just a minute!</p>
<p><strong>howie</strong>: That’s okay. We can still use the fireplace.
Phil, what say we set up over there and…</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Ms. Shriver, –</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: You know the more I think about this, Doctor,
the more I love it. I mean who better to testify to the effectiveness of
your book than one of your patients. I think it’s a two parter,
Lenny.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: I do to. Great idea, Dr. Marvin.
Terrific.</p>
<p><strong>howie</strong>: Live feed in ten.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Knock em dead, honey.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Howie, I don’t like that there.</p>
<p><strong>howie</strong>: Five – four – three –</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Can I use the bathroom?</p>
<p>****: Good Morning. We’re live in the beautiful Lake Winnipesaukee
summer home of Dr. Leo M. Marvin, author of the newest sensation in
therapy, Baby Steps. Also with us is Dr. Marvin’s patient, Bob Wiley.
Good morning, Dr. Marvin. Bob.</p>
<p>****: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: False alarm. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Dr. Marvin, it takes a remarkable amount of
confidence in your methods to bring on a patient with you. What in
particular about Bob’s prior condition would you like to share with
us?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Nothing? Nothing in particular you think we
should know?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Hum… Well… Let me try you, Bob.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Have you been a patient of Dr. Marvin’s for a
long time?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Long time? I wouldn’t call it a long time.
What? Three or four days?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Days?!</p>
<p>****: Well… you see… I was…, he was… I was…, following his case
through…, another psychiatrist… He thought I was, er, the perfect doctor
for the case. Because of my book.</p>
<p>****: Ah.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Why you sly dogs, he was right! I want to say
that if more wisdom, or more empathy, or more pure intelligence exists
than exits in this man, I want to know about it. Do you know that he
actually had me sleep here last night? In his jamies, using his
toothbrush!</p>
<p>****: That’s a very unusual technique.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Well –</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I’ll say and I’ve been to them all. Doctors who
made you beat pillows.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Doctors who make you scream.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: But this doctor has something simple. Baby
Steps.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Baby step across the room. Baby step across the
room…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Are you getting the book?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Let me tell you what I used to be like before I
met Dr M.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Eleven years ago I was not the man you see
today. Eleven years ago…</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Bob, that stuff about yourself was
refreshingly honest. Could we talk to you again in a few months to
update your progress?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Sure. As long as my doctor gives
permission.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Thank you for your hospitality,
Mrs. Marvin.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Anytime!</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I’m… ruined!</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Ruined?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: My career… Everything I’ve worked for…,
over!</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: But daddy…</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Get out.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Is it something, I said?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Is this aversion therapy?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: My god, Leo, what’s got into you?</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: Dad, you’re over reacting. What about
Bob?</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: Yeah, what about Bob?</p>
<p><strong>another doctor</strong>: What about Bob?</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: Dad…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Daddy, look at your behavior. What are you
doing?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: What am I doing? What am I doing?!</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Wednesday… Afternoon…</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I’m going sailing!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: The fam is hurt. I’ve hurt them. I didn’t mean
to. Certainly they realize that. I’ve hurt the fam. Hurt the fam. I’ve
hurt the fam.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Hi fam! Bye fam!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I hurt the fam.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I could apologize. But then I’d have to go back
and I’m not sure they want me. I hurt the fam. That much I know. Hurt
the fam.</p>
<p><strong>vendor</strong>: Hot dog, bub?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: This has to be some kind of test. I know I hurt
them but they have to know I didn’t mean it. If it’s a test… I ate a hot
dog.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I mean it’s summer time right, what could
their audience be, five million? Most of them hardly pay attention
anyway, right? The point is, the book got on. It couldn’t hurt sales,
that much could it?</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Of course not.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I mean… It’s a disaster, Fay!</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Honey…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Hey, look. Isn’t that Bob?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Dr. M! Dr. M., I’ve had a breakthrough! I ate a
hot dog! I’m driving a boat! Thanks to you!</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: It is Bob! It’s Bob!</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Oh no.</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: Hey, Bob!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I’m really making progress now! I feel like a
whole new world is opening up!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: My childhood memories are rushing over me like
a flood!</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Coming about!</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Daddy, what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Go away!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Daddy, he’s trying to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: Dad…</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Go away, do you hear me!!</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Leo, the boom!</p>
<p><strong>anna, fay, siggy</strong>: Daddy! Leo! Dad!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I never had a father, really. Dad left one
morning and never came back. My earliest memory is mom with a suitcase.
Do you think that’s significant?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I’d like to do some free association about my
infancy: A beachball. A dog. A frog. A log. Poodle, noodle, doodle…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Will do!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Wherever we’re going, Fay wants us home by
seven.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: No problem.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: It’s a combustible relationship, isn’t it? Is
it just you and me or is it you and everybody? So what’s the big
surprise?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Intensive psychotherapy.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Really?!</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Isn’t that what you came here for?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Yeah! But what brought this on now?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: You’re ready.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Wow. This is exciting.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Leo Marvin to see Dr. Tomsky.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Where are we?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Therapy land, Bob. A twentieth century theme
park of the mind.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: The lines look short today.</p>
<p><strong>dr. tomsky</strong>: Hello, Leo. Long time no see! Is this
our friend?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Bob Wiley, this is your new pal,
Dr. Tomsky.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: New pal? What’s wrong with my old pal?</p>
<p><strong>big attendant 1</strong>: Let us show you to your room.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Hey! Don’t touch me! I have seizures! Dr. M!
Dr. M!!</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I really appreciate your helping me out on
this, Kenneth.</p>
<p><strong>tomsky</strong>: I can only hold him for twenty four hours,
Leo. Without staff corroboration.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I’m not worried in the least, Kenneth. I’m
sure your entire staff will corroborate. With intensive treatment he
should be out in about – fifty years.</p>
<p><strong>marvin and tape</strong>: “I’ll be what I am, solitary
man.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Dad, you okay?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: “Okay, Anna Mae, Leo Marvin’s okay Leo
Marvin, he’s okay!”</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: Where’s Bob?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Yeah, dad, where’s Bob?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Can’t a man enjoy himself on vacation?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Dad – ?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Bob sends his regrets but he had to take a
trip.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: What kind of trip? I thought you were working
with him.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I was.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Then why’d he go on a trip?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Why does a man climb a mountain, Anna?
Because it’s there.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: He didn’t even say good-bye?</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: He just left?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: It’s not like Bob not to say good- bye.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: That’s why he left, you see. He just wasn’t
himself. He’ll write.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Dad, if you did something to Bob…</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Anna, what do you take me for? Everything’s
fine.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Leo, a Dr. Tomsky says it’s urgent.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Leo, where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Out.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Just like that? Be home by seven, okay?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Something’s rotten in Winnipesaukee.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Wait, I’ve another one. Who knows the
difference between Freud and Moses?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Well if you don’t know, I’m going to another
clinic!</p>
<p><strong>tomsky</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: So a psychiatrist and a psychologist go into a
bar and order Bloody Marys…</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Kenneth, you have been duped by a textbook
narcissist. A brilliant neuropath!</p>
<p><strong>tomsky</strong>: Brilliant enough to dupe my entire staff? I
doubt that.</p>
<p><strong>tomsky</strong>: I’m giving you back his admitting forms,
Leo, to save you any embarrassment.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Embarrassment?!</p>
<p><strong>tomsky</strong>: It’s perfectly natural for a patient to bond
with his analyst. It’s a normal part of therapy. If you want to be rid
of him, simply take him back where you got him and go home.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: That’s easy for you to say! He’s human crazy
glue! If it were that simple do you think I’d be here?</p>
<p><strong>tomsky</strong>: You should have never let him sleep in your
pajamas, Leo. His problems don’t go away just because you want them
too.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Whose side are you on?!</p>
<p><strong>tomsky</strong>: Relax, Leo.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I’m relaxed!</p>
<p><strong>tomsky</strong>: Take a vacation.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I’m on vacation!!</p>
<p><strong>tomsky</strong>: Are you sure? Maybe you should check in here
for a few days and get a handle on things?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Intensive psychotherapy? – boy, you weren’t
kidding, were you? I mean even Dr. T. didn’t think I needed that. Look I
have an idea – how are your afternoons? I mean since we’re here together
with nothing else to do, what say we work from two to four, something
like that?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Get out! Get out of my car, get out of my
life, don’t ever come back!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Are you saying you’d prefer mornings?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What is this, isolation therapy?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You’re the doctor.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: No! You won’t catch me!! NO!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Need any help?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Remember: be home by seven.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: First he ruins my life, now he ruins my
tire!</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: God! Damn! Son of a bitching! Bob!</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Shit piss crap! Son of a bitching douche bag
asshole!</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: What about Bob?! Think about Bob! What about
Bob? What about Bob? WHAT</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I’m home!</p>
<p><strong>party guests</strong>: Surprise! “Happy Birthday to you,
Happy Birthday to you! Happy Birthd…</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: Dad, what happened?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Leo, look at yourself!</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Just a little car trouble, hon. I’m
fine.</p>
<p><strong>party guest 1</strong>: Happy Birthday, Leo.</p>
<p><strong>party guest 2</strong>: Some night to have car trouble. You
almost missed your own surprise party!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Happy Birthday, Dr. M!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I couldn’t miss your birthday!</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I want you dead! Dead, you hear me,
dead!</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: I’ve never seen him like this, Phil. He’s got
this delusion about Bob Wiley being the cause of all his problems and I
don’t know what to do.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: He’s under a lot of stress, Fay. His book, his
interview which frankly didn’t go so well, his birthday. That’s a lot to
bite off all at once. I’ll give him a sedative and he’ll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: You really think so?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You feeling better?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I’m fine. It’s your dad I’m worried about. How
is he?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Upstairs. Resting. I can’t understand why he’d
attack you like that.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I can’t either. But one thing I’ve learned
about psychiatrists: they’re brilliant manipulators. I trust your dad
completely. I’m sure everything he’s done has been to help me. How come
you aren’t making a move on George Stark?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Bob, we’ve talked about this.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: No, you’ve talked about it and I’ve listened.
In my opinion, George Stark’s smile is not Oedipal regression and it’s
not confused libido. It’s one good looking guy drooling over you, Anna
Marvin.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Bob…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Go ask if you can put your tongue in his mouth.
I hear it works every time.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Hi. Fay said to introduce myself. I’m Lily,
Leo’s neurotic sister.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: A pleasure. I’m neurotic too.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Really, what a coincidence. Am I disturbing
you?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Only in a good way. Sit down.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: It must be nice having an analyst in the
family.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: I don’t know, ask Leo. I’m an analyst too.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You’re kidding?!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: That should give you some interesting ideas
for your next book. You might even wake up feeling happy.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I doubt it. Phil, do you remember a
classmate named Fensterwald?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Carswell Fensterwald? Sure. Who could
forget?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I’ve forgotten and I don’t know why. Did
anything unusual happen with him?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You’re joking.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Do I act like a man who’s joking?!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Relax, Leo. I just can’t believe you’d block
something like that out. Carswell was at Harvard with us. You turned him
in for cheating.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: What…?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Don’t you remember? You brought action against
him for stealing your psychoanalysis notes and they booted him. The only
place that would take him after that was University of Guadalajara.</p>
<p><strong>tomksy</strong>: Leo, is there something about Carswell
that’s disturbing you? Leo…?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Thanks, Phil. Enjoy the party.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Baby steps, make a plan.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Can I help you, doctor?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I want to buy a gun.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: I’ve got Winchesters. Colts. What do you plan
on hunting?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Er. An animal. This tall. Hundred and
seventy pounds. Bermuda shorts.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Take a look at this baby. It’ll shoot through
anything but it also leaves a clean wound.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Your wife was in with that Bob fellow. Sure is
a nice guy.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: What do you have that leaves a messy
wound?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: I’ll need you driver’s license, social
security number, and you can pick them up on Friday… the 18th.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: The eighteenth?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: There’s a two week waiting period in this
state.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I can’t wait two weeks! I need these
now!</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Dr. Marvin, it’s the law.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: What about explosives? Any waiting period
there?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: “Bob fell in to a Burning ring of fire. He
went down down down And the flames went higher. And it burned burned
burned, That ring of fire. The ring of fire.”</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: “Dear Mr. and Mrs. G., If I’m not here, I’m
at the Marvins. Would you feed Gil? Thanks. Bob. P.S. Your denture
adhesives arrived so I put them in your mailbox. Enjoy. Bob.”</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Well if you hear from him, Donna, please call…
Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Nobody’s seen him.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: I’m going looking for him.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Me too.</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: Me too.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Me too.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Shouldn’t somebody stay here in case he comes
back?</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: I’ll stay.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I’ll stay.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: We’ll leave him a note.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Bob, I’m not defending Leo’s recent behavior in
any way, so please don’t take this personally. However irrational the
reasons, Leo is so upset with you that I think it would be best if you
weren’t around when he comes back.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: Yeah, mom. Why?</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Because I say so, Siggy. Please don’t think
it’s the way I want it. It’s just that Leo’s not himself.</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: It’s not Bob’s fault.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Listen to your mom, Siggy. All of you get out
of here, okay? I’ll straighten up before I go and when Dr. M. comes
home, everything will be exactly the way he likes it.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Bob you’re such a dear. Take good care, all
right?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You give George a chance okay?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Give me leather, ass wiping bastard head.</p>
<p><strong>siggy</strong>: Green puking piss-ant.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Bye, fam.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I guess this is good-bye, fam.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Get up and don’t make a sound!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Dr. M.! Everybody’s looking for you.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I said shut up!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Okay. You’re the doc.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Where we going hiking?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Into the woods.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Is this is a new form of therapy?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Yeah, Bob, it’s death therapy. It’s a
guaranteed cure.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Death therapy. I like it.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: This is pretty imaginative, Dr. M. Will this be
in your new book?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: If it is, I’ll dedicate it to you, how’s
that?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Great. Ow. That hurts. Ow.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What is this now, pain therapy?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Exactly. Now yell and scream and suffer!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Ow! Ahh! Ow! That really hurts.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Say hello to Freud for me.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Dr. M, this hurts!</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Love hurts.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Music to die by, Bob!</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I guess it was suicide, Fay. He tried it
once, remember. Just goes to show, you never can tell.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I’m worried about getting gangrene, Dr. M! I
think I get the point!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: At least I think I get the point. Maybe I’m not
supposed to sit here. Maybe I’m supposed to undo these outer knots…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: So that my inner knots…, these strong…,
restricting…, inner knots…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Will come undone too.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Ahh!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Death therapy cured me!</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Yes! I used to be so afraid of everything, it
was like dying a thousand deaths a day. Now, that you showed me I have
only one death to be afraid of, I’m not afraid of anything anymore!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Don’t be so modest!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Dr. M.?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Dr. M., I’m really cured!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Did somebody leave the gas on?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Why won’t you go away! I disgraced myself on
national television! No one will buy my book! My family’s going to hate
me!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Dr. M., your family loves you.</p>
<p><strong>the guttmans</strong>: Burn. Burn! Burn!!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Dr. M. you have the crown jewels of England all
around you. You have a wife with a generous heart. You have great kids
and an incredible sister.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Stay away from my sister!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Dr. M, you have a fam!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You know, I’m beginning to think you’re an
ingrate.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: People are miserable all over the world and
you’re killing yourself? You should be ashamed.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Don’t talk that way to me!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Maybe I was wrong about you.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Do you hear me?!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Maybe you’re not so good after all.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I’ll kill you!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: And they took him away.</p>
<p><strong>doctor 1</strong>: My god, it was insanity. Bob drove Marvin
to complete insanity!</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Leo was taken to the Tomsky Institute for a
few days for observation. He lost his medical license, of course. A
doctor can’t try to kill one of his patients and expect to get away with
it.</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: Well thank god for that. I mean…, you know… I
mean… Then what happened?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Leo was returned to his family.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Bob and the family rented a lakeside cottage
where they could help Leo recuperate.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I understand. Sure.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Tough business.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I’m going over here. I’ll be right over
here.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Okay, I’m with Siggy.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Phone.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Phone.</p>
<p>****: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>voice on phone</strong>: May I speak to Bob, please?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Bob’s… unavailable right now. Can… I take a
message?</p>
<p><strong>voice on phone</strong>: I’m Mr. Jameson with the Tucson
school district. Bob contacted us about buying some toothbrushes but
we’re going to have to cancel the order.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Tucson canceling order… Any message why?</p>
<p><strong>jameson</strong>: It’s not a priority right now.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Not priority… right now. Why?</p>
<p>****: Well… money’s tight and…</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Sure. Though, you know there is another way
to look at it.</p>
<p>****: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Well… if you gave a new toothbrush and
taught dental hygiene to every student at your school… In the long run
you’d save them thousands of dollars. I mean look at the cost of dental
bills. I bet I could have put my kids through college with what I’ve
spent on fillings.</p>
<p><strong>jameson</strong>: That’s an interesting point.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: It is, isn’t it? Maybe you should try the
toothbrushes. You might do a lot for education by saving teeth.</p>
<p><strong>jameson</strong>: Huh. I never thought of that. I tell you
what. Tell Bob we’ll take the order and see how it goes.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Fay.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Fay!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Leo Marvin now makes toothbrushes.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: The irony, of course, is that Bob brought the
family closer than they’d ever been before. Harvey Green saw Leo last
month and said he never looked happier.</p>
<p><strong>feinberg</strong>: My god. The poor bastard.</p>
<p><strong>another doctor</strong>: And you thought you had
nightmares.</p>
<p><strong>feinberg</strong>: Unbelievable…</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: What happened to Bob?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Bob married Lily and had triplets. He went
back to school, got a degree in marriage-family-counseling, and now has
a big practice on Park and 75th.</p>
<p><strong>son</strong>: Douche bag.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Bastard head!</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Son of a bitch!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Try ass wipe of the universe.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Ass wipe of the universe!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Excellent.</p>
<p><strong>doctor 2</strong>: Wait a minute. You’re not telling me that
Bob Wiley is Dr. Robert S. Wiley, the psychologist?!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: That’s exactly what I’m telling you.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Hey Bob! Hello, BOB!!</p>
<p><strong>feinberg</strong>: Wrote that huge best seller? What’s it
called?</p>
<p><strong>feinberg</strong>: Vacation Therapy!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Exactly. Sold 2 million copies.</p>
<p><strong>doctor 2</strong>: I don’t believe it!</p>
<p><strong>doctor 1</strong>: Pinch me!</p>
<p><strong>feinberg</strong>: I’ll never take another vacation as long
as I live!</p>
