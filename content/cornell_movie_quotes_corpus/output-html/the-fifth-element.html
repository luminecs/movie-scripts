<p><strong>professor</strong>: “..when the three planets are in
eclipse..”</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: “..the black hole like a door is open…
Evil comes … sowing terror and chaos…” See? The snake, Billy. The
Ultimate Evil … make sure you get the snake!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: And when is this door opening snake act
supposed to occur?</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: ..if this is the five..and this the
thousand..</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Every five thousand years..</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: So I have some time..</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: Omar. Standing at the entrance to the
chamber with the water bag, entranced by the sight. A skeletal hand
falls on his shoulder. Omar turns to an ancient PRIEST in a rough milled
black cannock.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: I will take it to them my son.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Go with God.. be safe from Evil..</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: The Professor is back to translating,
Billy to sketching.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: “..then arrange the elements of life
against the Terror just so..”</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: “..Water..fire..earth..air..four elements
around the fifth..”</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: Aziz falling asleep. The mirror falls, the
light fails.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Aziz! Light!</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Lord forgive me.. they already know too,
much..</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: “..in which all the history of the
Universe resides ..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from
Evil..”</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Amen..</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Father.. it in the most extraordinary
thing.. the greatest find in history..can you imagine the
implications.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Only too well… here you must be
parched..</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: I mean look.. it is like a battle
plan..</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Here the Good.. Here the Evil..</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Here..</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: A weapon against evil. Amazing! I am
going to be famous.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Then let us toast to your fame! Here
Billy..</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Drink!</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: To fame.. salud..</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: We cannot toast with water.. Billy ! In
my sack.. the Grappa!</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: “..this perfect person.. this perfect
being..” I do not understand this.. perfect?</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Where is that boy? Billy!</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: And this divine Light they talk about..
what is Divine light?</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Aziz light!</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Better.. this is the most unbelievable
thing I have ever seen..</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: …Uh, yes?</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Master… He was about to discover everything,
but I had the situation under control.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Who are you? Are you Germans? Sprechen
Sie Deutsch?</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: What did I do wrong?</p>
<p><strong>kommander</strong>: Servant, you and the thousand guards
before you… You have done your work well, but we have to recover the
elements. War will soon engulf your planet. We must keep them safe.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Unbelievable!!!</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: The Fifth Element…</p>
<p><strong>kommander</strong>: Take them and put them in a safe
place.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Will the elements be gone now forever from
this place?</p>
<p><strong>kommander</strong>: When mankind comes to its senses. We will
return.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Knowing mankind as I do, that could take
centuries!</p>
<p><strong>kommander</strong>: Time is of no importance, only life is
important.</p>
<p><strong>kommander</strong>: When EVIL returns so shall we.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: We will be ready, Lord.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Stop.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: No!!! Don’t!!!</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Hurry, Kommander! The wall’s closing!!!</p>
<p><strong>kommander</strong>: A mission is a mission, Savoia. You’ll
learn that.</p>
<p><strong>kommander</strong>: My apologies to General Kroi – and my
wife..</p>
<p><strong>staedert</strong>: Don’t you have anything? Not even a
temperature?</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: The thermo-analyzers have jammed. One of
them reads over a million degrees, the other’s at minus 5000… Never seen
anything like it.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: It’s taking shape.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: What the hell can it be?</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: Hook-up with the president in one
minute, General.</p>
<p><strong>staedert</strong>: …Send out a probe.</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: On air in 30 seconds.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: President on line sir..</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Staedert, do you read me?</p>
<p><strong>staedert</strong>: I can hear you, Mr. President, but I can’t
see you .</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Is that better?</p>
<p><strong>staedert</strong>: Perfect, Mr. President.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: I have to address the Supreme Council in
10 minutes. Just the facts, General.</p>
<p><strong>staedert</strong>: There are no results from the chemical and
molecular analysis as of yet, all the calibers are overshot..we’re
hoping a thermo nucleatic imaging..</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: What you are saying is you don’t know
what this..thing..is.</p>
<p><strong>staedert</strong>: Not yet Sir..The only thing we know is it
just keeps getting bigger!</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Options.</p>
<p><strong>staedert</strong>: Wait or act.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Recommendations.</p>
<p><strong>staedert</strong>: My philosophy Mr. President is shoot first
ask questions later. I don’t like uninvited guests.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Gentlemen?</p>
<p><strong>head chemists</strong>: I think it would be foolish to shoot
at an organism that seems alive, without first taking the time to study
it more! Besides, it has shown no signs of hostility.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: No… it’s just getting bigger.</p>
<p><strong>head chemists</strong>: So do people, but that’s no reason to
shoot them.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: The security of the Federated Territories
is and remains number one priority. I suppose General Staedert’s
“philosophy” is acceptable to you?</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: All right, then! Staedert?</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Mr. President?</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: …Yes?</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Cornelius, Vito Cornelius. 50th level
parish. I have a different theory to offer you, Mr. President.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: I’m listening.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Imagine for a moment that this. thing is
not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be,
because it is the antithesis of all we are. Because it is evil.. TOTAL
EVIL.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: One more reason to shoot first eh?</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Evil begets evil, Mr. President. Shooting
would only make it stronger.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: The probe will attain its objective in
five seconds.</p>
<p><strong>staedert</strong>: Mr. President, we’re at crisis point.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Your theory is interesting Father but I
don’t think we have time to go into it right now!</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Time is of no importance, Mr. President.
Only life is important.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: That’s exactly what we are going to try
and do: Protect the lives of some 200 billion of our fellow citizens!
General? You may fire when ready.</p>
<p><strong>staedert</strong>: ..Up front loading of a 120 ZZR missile.
Marker lights on the objective.</p>
<p><strong>scientist</strong>: Its structure has just solidified on the
surface, as if the object felt something. If that’s the case, we are
undoubtedly dealing with an intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: The most terrible intelligence
imaginable, Mr. President.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: …The ship is in combat formation. The
missile is loaded, General.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Staedert? Give me a minute… I have a
doubt.</p>
<p><strong>staedert</strong>: I don’t, Mr. President.</p>
<p><strong>staedert</strong>: Load a series of 740 missiles. Maximum
shield protection.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Yes, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Staedert? What’s going on? Did you
destroy it?</p>
<p><strong>staedert</strong>: I’m about to, Mr. President.</p>
<p><strong>scientist</strong>: The planet’s diameter has greatly
increased and it’s moving toward the ship.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Staedert? Get out of there immediately! I
don’t want an incident, do you hear me, Staedert?</p>
<p><strong>staedert</strong>: …What do we have that’s bigger than
240?</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Nothing, General.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Staedert, get out of there! That’s an
order!</p>
<p><strong>staedert</strong>: … Good God!</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: I’m coming.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>finger</strong>: Hey bud! Finger here.</p>
<p><strong>finger</strong>: I love you too Major, but you haven’t called
me that since basic training.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: I was talking to the cat.</p>
<p><strong>finger</strong>: Oh, yeah, I forgot.You still prefer your cat
to the real thing.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: At least, the cat comes back.</p>
<p><strong>finger</strong>: You still pining for that two timing bitch.
Forget her. There are a million women out there.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: I don’t want a million - I just want one. A
perfect one.</p>
<p><strong>finger</strong>: Don’t exist bud.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: I just found a picture of you.</p>
<p><strong>finger</strong>: How do I look?</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Like shit.</p>
<p><strong>finger</strong>: Must be an old picture.. Listen, you gotta
bring me your hack for the 6 month overhaul. A.S.A.P.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: I don’t need one.</p>
<p><strong>finger</strong>: You forgetting who sat next to you for a
thousand missions. I know how you drive.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Finger! I’m driving a cab now, not a space
fighter!!</p>
<p><strong>finger</strong>: How many points you got left on your
license?</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Uh… at least fifty.</p>
<p><strong>finger</strong>: In your dreams! See you tonight!</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Cheers!</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: We have forty-eight hours, the time it
needs to adapt itself to our living conditions.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: And then?</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: And then it will be too late. The goal of
evil is to wipe out life! All forms of life. For all eternity…Life
upsets it.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Is there anything that can stop it?</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Yes..thank God..</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: The Mondoshawans don’t belong to the
Federated Territories, but they are peaceful… in their possession are
the four elements of life. These elements when they are gathered around
a fifth: The Supreme Being, ultimate warrior, created to protect
life……</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: ..will produce what the ancients called
the light of creation, the light of total goodness which is the only
thing that can defeat EVIL.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: But what happens if instead of this…
Ultimate Warrior… it is EVIL who stands here?</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: White turns to black. Light to Dark. Life
to Death. For all eternity.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Sir, we have a Mondoshawan spaceship at the
frontier requesting permission to enter our territory.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: I guess I should make a decision..</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: They are the only ones who can help..</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Sir..the Mondoshawan do not belong to the
federation. We do not know their intention.. I must recommend a full
trinuclear assault..</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Did you see that..thing..swallow our
battleship like a gum drop? You can’t even tell me what it is! I ask you
for options you give me bullshit. Give them permission to enter our
territories with my warmest regards.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Thank you, Mr. President.</p>
<p><strong>first officer</strong>: Two non-identified ships
approaching.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Must be the welcoming committee.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: We’ve been hit! General alert!!!</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: We’re losing control! We have to land
fast!</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Send out a distress signal!!! Activate the
emergency landing procedure!</p>
<p><strong>first officer</strong>: Impact in less than ten seconds!</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Time is of no importance…</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Don’t watch it all day, it’ll rot your mind.
Bye sweetie..</p>
<p><strong>mugger</strong>: The cash man!</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Been here long?</p>
<p><strong>mugger</strong>: Don’t fuck with me man or I’ll blow you into
tomorrow!</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Isn’t that a Z140? Alleviated titanium.
Neuro charged assault model?</p>
<p><strong>mugger</strong>: Uh..</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: You know you could hurt someone with this
puppy..good thing it’s not loaded..</p>
<p><strong>mugger</strong>: It’s not?</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: You gotta push the little yellow button…</p>
<p><strong>mugger</strong>: Thanks..</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: You’re welcome..</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: ..you know these things are VERY illegal..
you could get in a shit load of trouble.. I better hang onto it for
you..</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Please enter your license..</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Welcome on board Mr. Dallas..</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: How you doing this morning? Sleep OK? I
didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Fuel level 6.03..Propulsion 2x4…</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: I had the worst goddamn nightmare.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You have nine points left on your
license..</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Thanks for reminding me..</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Have a nice day..</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Right..</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: We are lost!</p>
<p><strong>general munro</strong>: Mr. President, the attack was
launched by two unregistered warships.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Close all borders and declare a state of
general alert.</p>
<p><strong>general munro</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Try to contact these Mondoshawans. We owe
them an explanation.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: What are we going to do?</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: This is government business now. You
ought to go home and get some rest, Father.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: I promise to keep you informed.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: …Has the rescue team found any
survivors?</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: This is all that survived?</p>
<p><strong>mactilburgh</strong>: Actually only one cell survived..</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: Have you identified it?</p>
<p><strong>mactilburgh</strong>: It’s not that easy..we’ve never
encountered anything like it before..you see normal human beings have 40
DNA memo groums..which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate
itself..This one has 200,000.</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: Talk English Doc.</p>
<p><strong>mactilburgh</strong>: This cell is like a huge library. It
has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside. Almost like it
was…engineered.</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: Sounds like a freak of nature to me.</p>
<p><strong>mactilburgh</strong>: Yes… I can’t wait to meet him.</p>
<p><strong>mactilburgh</strong>: The compositional elements of his DNA
chain are the same as ours, there are simply more of them tightly
packed. His knowledge is probably limitless..</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?</p>
<p><strong>mactilburgh</strong>: We put it through the cellular hygiene
detector. The cell is for lack of a better word… perfect.</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: OK, go ahead! But Mr. Perfect better be
polite… otherwise I turn him into cat food.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Three seconds to ultra-violet
protection.</p>
<p><strong>mactilburgh</strong>: …This is the crucial phase, The
reconstruction of pigment. Cells are bombarded with slightly greasy
solar atoms which forces the body cells to react, to protect themselves.
That means growing skin. Clever, eh?</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: Wonderful!</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: … End of reconstruction, beginning of
reanimation .</p>
<p><strong>mactilburgh</strong>: Activate life support system.</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: Life support system activated.</p>
<p><strong>mactilburgh</strong>: Remove the shield.</p>
<p><strong>mactilburgh</strong>: I told you … perfect!</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: …I’d, uh , like to get a few pictures for the
archives before she wakes up.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Ouacra cocha o dayodomo binay ouacra mo cocha
ferji akba ligounai makta keratapla. Tokemata tokemata! Seno
santonoi-aypa! Minoi ay Cheba! Givomana seno!</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: What’s she saying?</p>
<p><strong>mactilburgh</strong>: Activate the phonic detector.</p>
<p><strong>mactilburgh</strong>: And give her a light sedative… and
something to wear!</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: This thing solid?</p>
<p><strong>mactilburgh</strong>: An elephant couldn’t crack it.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Teno akta chataman assin-omekta!</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: You’re gonna have to learn to communicate
better than that angel if you want out.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Get me a chair or a stepladder The rest of
you go through the main ventilation!</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Go on follow her!</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: …No way.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: This in the police. Your status is illegal.
Please put up your hands and follow our instructions!</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Christ! She dove off!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You have just had an accident. Seven points
have been temporarily removed…</p>
<p><strong>voice / korben</strong>: You have one point left on your
license. Have a good day.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Akina delutan, nou-shan.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: …’Scuse me?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: You have an unauthorized passenger in your
vehicle. We are going to arrest her. Please leave your hands on the
wheel. Thank you for your cooperation.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Sorry, Hon, but I only got one point left on
my license and I gotta get to the garage!</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Please… HELP…</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Don’t put me in this position… I can’t… I’m
late as it is…</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Finger’s gonna kill me.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Your license has been revoked. Would you
please….</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: I hate when people cry… I got no
defense…</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Daya deo dono Dato. Dalutan!</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: It there’s one thing I don’t need advice on,
it’s how to drive.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Shit! Attention all-patrol cars!</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: We’ll wait till things quiet down a bit. You
mind?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: …Priest…</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: You’re not that bad… Come on we’ll get you
to a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Vito… Cor… Ni-lious… Priest…</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Vito Cornelius?</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Excuse me, I’m looking for a priest.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Weddings are one floor down.

cousins..</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Perfect…</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: It’s a miracle!!!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What is?</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: I can’t wear these clothes! This calls
for dignity! I have to dress the part!</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Eto Akta Gamat!</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: I’m sorry, it’s just that… I was told to
wake you up gently, so I figured…</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: You’re right, I was wrong! I shouldn’t have
kissed you… especially since we haven’t been introduced and… Here, it’s
a bit late, but… my name is Korben, Korben Dallas. Keep it, you never
know, maybe… you’ll need a cab one day. I’ll be happy to open the door
this time!.</p>

on her gloves!</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: They all like this in your family,
father?</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: She’s an exception..</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Thank you so much for your help Mr…?</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Dallas. Korben Dallas.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Yes. That’s fine! Thank you very much. A
thousand times over!</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: I might call to check up on her, you know…
to see if she’s better?</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: She’s fine, really..don’t you worry..
just needs some rest..she’s had a very long trip.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: I know. I was there when she arrived.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Excuse me! Just one thing! She said
something to me a while ago and… I don’t really get it… Akta Gamat?</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: It means, “Never without my
permission”.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: That’s what I thought.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: …Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Evening…</p>
<p><strong>neighbor</strong>: Fuck you!</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: …Thanks… You, too.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Oh god. I forgot your food … I’m really
sorry! How about a nice Thai nosh to apologize? How does that sound,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>finger</strong>: Hey bud…I’m waiting all day here.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Finger..man..I’m sorry..listen..I was on the
way over but I had a fare fall into my lap.. y’know one of those big
fares you just can’t resist..</p>
<p><strong>finger</strong>: So, just how big was this fare?</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: 5’7”, green eyes… long legs… great skin…
perfect..</p>
<p><strong>finger</strong>: Uh huh..and I don’t suppose you got the name
of this..perfect fare..</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Leeloo..</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What’s she doing?</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Learning our history! The last 5000 years
that she missed! She’s been out of circulation a while, you know.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: What’re you laughing about?</p>
<p><strong>leeloo</strong>: Napoleon… small.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Uh father, I know she’s been through a lot…
but the sacred stones..we don’t have much time..</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Yes. Of course..</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Leeloo..I’m sorry to interrupt you
but..</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: The case..with the stones… Where is
it?</p>
<p><strong>leeloo</strong>: San Agamat chay bet… envolet!</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: The case was stolen?</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Who in gods name would do such a
thing?</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: A pair of feet limping heavily. A MAN
comes alongside them.</p>
<p><strong>right arm</strong>: Excuse me sir, the council is worried
about the economy heating up. They wondered if it would be possible to
fire 500…</p>
<p><strong>zorg</strong>: Fire 1000.</p>
<p><strong>right arm</strong>: But… 500 is all they need, sir.</p>
<p><strong>right arm</strong>: 1000! Fine, sir! Sorry to have disturbed
you.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: There was this guy with a limp who came a
month ago..said he was an art dealer … Asking all these questions about
the Sacred Stones..at the time I didn’t think anything of it.. What was
his name? I’m so bad with names…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I didn’t know your size.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: They really made her…</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Perfect.</p>
<p><strong>leeloo</strong>: Domo danko!</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Leeloo? The Stones… We must get them
back.</p>
<p><strong>leeloo</strong>: Ikset-kiba. Me imanetaba oum dalat!</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: You know exactly where they are!</p>
<p><strong>zorg</strong>: Aknot? Is that you?</p>
<p><strong>zorg</strong>: …What an ugly face! Doesn’t suit you at all!
Take it off…</p>
<p><strong>zorg</strong>: That’s better! Never be ashamed of who you
are… You’re warriors… be proud…</p>
<p><strong>zorg</strong>: So what if the Federal Army crushed your
entire race and scattered your people to the wind… Your time for revenge
is at hand… Voila… the ZF1.</p>
<p><strong>zorg</strong>: …It’s light… the handle’s adjustable for easy
carrying… good for righties and lefties.</p>
<p><strong>zorg</strong>: … Breaks down into four parts, undetectable by
X-rays.. It’s the ideal weapon for quick, discreet interventions. A word
on fire power: Titanium recharger. 3000 round clip with bursts of 3 to
300. With the replay button, another Zorg innovation, it’s even easier…
one shot.</p>
<p><strong>zorg</strong>: … and replay sends every following shot to the
same location…</p>
<p><strong>zorg</strong>: I recharge, but the enemy has launched a
cowardly sneak attack from behind, the automirror takes care of that.
Gives me the time to turn around and finish the job. 300 round bursts,
then there are the Zorg oldies…</p>
<p><strong>zorg</strong>: …Rocket launcher. The always efficient flame
thrower… My favorite. Our famous net launcher, the arrow launcher, with
exploding or poisonous gas heads - very practical. And for the grand
finale, the all-new ice-cube system!</p>
<p><strong>zorg</strong>: …Four full crates, delivered right on time!
What about you, my dear Aknot, did you bring me what I asked you
for?</p>
<p><strong>zorg</strong>: …Magnificent.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: What do you mean empty?</p>
<p><strong>zorg</strong>: Alright..I’ve got an open mind here.. anyone
care to explain?</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: She says that the Guardians never really
had much faith in humans. They were afraid of being attacked. The stones
were given to someone they could trust who took another route. She’s
supposed to contact this person in a little less than twelve hours from
now in a hotel. She’s looking for the address!</p>
<p><strong>leeloo</strong>: Dot!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Planet Fhloston, in the Angel
constellation</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: …We’re saved!</p>
<p><strong>zorg</strong>: I’m fucked!</p>
<p><strong>aknot</strong>: You asked for a case. We brought you a
case.</p>
<p><strong>zorg</strong>: A case with four stones in it. Not one! Not
two or three! But four!!! Four stones!!! What the fuck am I supposed to
do with an EMPTY case?!!</p>
<p><strong>aknot</strong>: …We are warriors, not merchants!</p>
<p><strong>zorg</strong>: But you can still count. Look… my fingers.</p>
<p><strong>zorg</strong>: …Four stones, four crates… Zero stones…</p>
<p><strong>zero crates!!!</strong>: Put everything back, we’re outta
here.</p>
<p><strong>aknot</strong>: We risked our lives. I believe a little
compensation is in order.</p>
<p><strong>zorg</strong>: So, you are a merchant, after all. Leave them
one crate. For the cause!</p>
<p><strong>zorg</strong>: I don’t like warriors! They’re too
narrow-minded, no sublety. Worse, they fight for hopeless causes..for
honor! Honor has killed millions of people but hasn’t saved a single
one. You know what – do I like though, I like killer. A real dyed in the
wool killer. Cold-blooded. Clean. Methodical. Thorough. A killer, when
he picked up the ZF1, would’ve immediately asked about the little red
button on the bottom of the gun.</p>
<p><strong>zorg</strong>: Bring the priest.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: So you forgive me?</p>
<p><strong>thai</strong>: Not going to open?</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: I’ve never gotten a message that wasn’t bad
news.</p>
<p><strong>thai</strong>: How someone strong like you scared from a
message? Is good news I sure!</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: The last two messages I got? The first one
was from my wife telling me she was leaving! And the second was from my
lawyer telling me he was leaving too… with my wife.</p>
<p><strong>thai</strong>: You right that is bad.. but mathematically
luck must change! Grandfather say: “It never rain every day.” This is
good news guarantee.. I bet you lunch!</p>
<p><strong>thai</strong>: …You’re fired. Oh!</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: At least I won lunch.</p>
<p><strong>thai</strong>: Good philosophy..see good in bad.. I like..I
prepare number one dessert.. special for you and pussy..</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I got it! Everything here we need to know
about Fhloston Paradise Hotel… and a detailed blueprint of the entire
hotel!</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Good work, my son. Now all we need is a
way to get there.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: I’ll get it. Finish your work my son.</p>
<p><strong>right arm</strong>: Father Cornelius?</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: My son?</p>
<p><strong>right arm</strong>: Mr. Zorg would like a word with you.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Mr. Who?</p>
<p><strong>zorg</strong>: Zorg. Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg… nice to see
you again</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: I remember you now..the so called art
dealer.</p>
<p><strong>zorg</strong>: I’m glad you got your memory back, Father…
Because you’re going to need it… Where are the stones?</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: …Why on earth do the stones interest
you?</p>
<p><strong>zorg</strong>: Personally, they are of no interest to me, I’d
rather sell weapons..but I have a customer… so tell me…</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Even it I did know where the stones were
I would never tell somebody like you.</p>
<p><strong>zorg</strong>: Why? What’s wrong with me?</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: …I’m a priest! I’m here to serve life,
All you want to do is destroy it.</p>
<p><strong>zorg</strong>: Ah, Father… You are so wrong. Let me
explain…</p>
<p><strong>zorg</strong>: …would you like a drink?</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: No thank you.</p>
<p><strong>zorg</strong>: Follow me.. Life, which you so nobly serve,
comes from destruction. Look at this empty glass.</p>
<p><strong>zorg</strong>: Here it is… peaceful… serene… but if it
is…</p>
<p><strong>zorg</strong>: Destroyed…</p>
<p><strong>zorg</strong>: …Look at all these little things… so busy all
of a sudden. Notice how each one is useful. What a lovely ballet, so
full of form and color. So full of..life!</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: They are robots!</p>
<p><strong>zorg</strong>: Yes but… by that simple gesture of
destruction. I gave work to at least fifty people today. The engineers,
the technicians, the mechanics. Fifty people who will be able to feed
their children so they can grow up big and strong. Children who will
have children of their own, adding to the great cycle of life!</p>
<p><strong>zorg</strong>: Father, by creating a little destruction, I
am, in fact, encouraging life! So, in reality, you and I are in the same
business!</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Destroying a glass is one thing..killing
people with the weapons you produce is quite another.</p>
<p><strong>zorg</strong>: Let me reassure you Father..I will never kill
more people in my entire life than religion has killed in the last 2000
years.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Where’s the robot to pat your back?</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Can I give you a hand?</p>
<p><strong>zorg</strong>: You saved my life… So, I’m going to spare
yours. Throw him out!</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: You are a monster, Zorg!</p>
<p><strong>zorg</strong>: I know…</p>
<p><strong>zorg</strong>: …Torture whoever you want, the president if
you have to but I want those Stones. You have an hour.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: It’s gobbling up all the communication
satellites in the galaxy!</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Why the hell is it eating up all those
satellites like that?</p>
<p><strong>head scientist</strong>: …We’re working on it, Mr. President.
We’re working on it.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: It should only choke on them.</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: I managed to contact the Mondoshawan. They
deplore the incident, but accept our apologies.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: And the Stones? Did you find them in the
wreckage?</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: The-Stones weren’t aboard the ship.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: …What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: The Mondoshawan never fully trusted the human
race..they felt we’re too unpredictable.. so they gave up the Stones to
somebody they do trust. Her name is Plavalaguna. She’s a Diva and she’s
going to sing at the charity ball on Fhloston Paradise in a few hours.
She has the Stones with her.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Excellent!</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: I want your best man on this!</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: Don’t worry, Sir. I have the perfect one.</p>
<p><strong>thai</strong>: Stewed jellyfish cake.. my speciality..</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Saved by the bell.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: …Hello?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: You’re the nastiest dirtbag I know in this
stinking City!</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Hi Ma…</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: I’ve been playing twice a week for 20 years,
20 years I’ve been eating those shitty croquettes.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: You wouldn’t even eat one to help your poor
mother, and you win the big prize? Know something? The whole thing makes
me sick!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Are you listening to me, you ingrate!</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Yes ma..</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Go on… This is gonna take a while!</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Other than that… You all right?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: …And now you’re making fun of me? I’m
warning you! If you don’t take me after all these years of sacrifice,
I’ll never forgive you!!</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: I’m coming!. Ma, what’re you talking
about?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: I get it! You want to make me beg, is that
it?</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: All I want is an explanation! I just got in,
I lost my job. I smashed my cab. I got mugged, but other than that
everything’s peachy, Ma, thanks for asking!! Now settle down and explain
to me calmly..</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: You just won a trip, you dolt! Ten days in
Fhloston Paradise for two!</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Ma. If I’d won, I’d know about it. Someone
would have notified me.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: They’ve been blaring out your name on the
radio for the last hour, blockhead!</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Ma.. it’s the door. I’ll call you back.</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: Major Dallas, if our calculations are correct
you still have 57 hours owed to the Federal Army on your enlistment
which is more than you will need for a mission of the utmost
importance.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: What mission?</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: To save the world.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Where have I heard this song before?</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: You’re to leave immediately for Fhloston
Paradise. Retrieve four Stones from the Diva Plavalaguna. And bring them
back with the utmost discretion as possible. Any questions’?</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Just one… why me?</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: Three reasons… One: As part of The Elite
Special Forces Unit of the Federated Army you are an expert in the use
of all weapons and spacecraft needed for this mission.</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: Two: Of all the members of your unit you were
the most highly decorated.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: And the third one?</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: You’re the only one left alive…</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: Don’t you open your messages?</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: I’ve had enough good news for today</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: You have won the annual Gemini contest and a
trip to Fhloston Paradise. For two. Congratulations. Here are your
tickets.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: You rigged the contest?</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: Major Iceborg will accompany you… as your
wife…</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: You couldn’t come up with something a little
more discreet?</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: Old tricks are the best tricks eh?</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: I’m not going.</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: One reason… I want to stay the only one left
alive.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: …Scuse me.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: …Shit!</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: It’s my wife.</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: I thought you were divorced.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: I mean my future.. my ex.. My future ex.. if
she sees you here I’m finished. She hates you guys. It’s what killed us
in the first place. Please…</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: …Sorry, General, but we’ve got no choice!
It’ll only take a minute! Let me set up another meeting and I’ll be
back.</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: Three of us will never fit in there!</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Oh, yes you will…</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: …Coming!</p>
<p><strong>leeloo</strong>: Apipoulai!</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: I suppose that means “Hi” ?</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: I’m sorry to have to resort to such
methods, but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the
tickets to Fhloston.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Is that the usual way priests go on
vacation?</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: We’re not going on vacation..we’re on a
mission..</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: What kind of mission?</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: We have to save the world.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Good luck..</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Father, I was in the Army for awhile and
every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only
thing that changed was I lost a lot of friends. So thanks for the
offer.. but no thanks.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: I’m sorry..</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: This is a police control action..</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: This is not an exercise. This is a police
control.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Oh my god oh my god..</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Leeloo, hide in here and don’t move!</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Trying to save your ass so you can save the
world.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: …Spread your legs and place your hands in the
yellow circles, please.</p>
<p><strong>cop 1</strong>: Put your hands in the yellow circles,
please.</p>
<p><strong>cop 1</strong>: Sir? Are you a human?</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: No, I’m a meat popsicle.</p>
<p><strong>cop 3</strong>: I found him!</p>
<p><strong>cop 1</strong>: Sir, this is a control. Please put your hands
in the yellow circles.</p>
<p><strong>neighbor</strong>: Fuck you!!</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Wrong answer.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: OK, we got the guy under wraps.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: It was not easy, but we bagged him!. Thanks for
the tip!</p>
<p><strong>right arm</strong>: Glad to help.</p>
<p><strong>right arm</strong>: They just arrested the guy for Uranium
smuggling. Everything’s going as planned.</p>
<p><strong>right arm</strong>: All I have to do now is to go to the
airport and take his place. I should be in Fhloston in less than four
hours.</p>
<p><strong>zorg</strong>: Don’t come back without the Stones.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: I’m really sorry.. there wasn’t time.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Here let me wrap you up.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: ..It’s funny. I’ve met you twice today and
you’ve ended up in my arms both times.</p>
<p><strong>leeloo</strong>: Valo massa… Chacha hamas.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Uh..you’re welcome.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Coffee! That’s what you need! A nice, hot
cup of coffee!</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: With some honey! You’ll see, honey’s
great!…</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: A hot cup of coffee… with honey…</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: I’ve got this great honey somewhere. You
know about honey? There used to be these little animals who made it with
antenna…</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: ..and these other animals who ate it.. one
were bees the other were bears..</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: I forget which ate it and which made it
but..</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Here it is!</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Taste this…</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: It… melts in your mouth, doesn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: You hear that?</p>
<p><strong>leeloo</strong>: Cornelius..</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Oh god!</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: I’m really sorry.. let me help you..</p>
<p><strong>leeloo</strong>: Achta ge lumitai de matala..</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>leeloo</strong>: Vano da, mechteba?! Soun domo kala chon
hammas!</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: No, I’m not proud of myself… But we don’t
have the luxury of choice.</p>
<p><strong>akanit</strong>: Korben Dallas! We got him.</p>
<p><strong>aknot</strong>: Perfect… Take command, Akanit. Go to Fhloston
and get the Stones… If Zorg really wants them… He’ll have to negotiate.
Revenge is at hand.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Jesus!… Some priest!</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Have you pulled yourself together?</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: …Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: I’ll take the mission.</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: Illegal gathering in Zone 4.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Leeloo, be careful.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Did you get them?</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Excellent… Leeloo Dallas.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: And Korben David Dallas.</p>
<p><strong>leeloo</strong>: Akta dedero ansila do mektet.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: I can’t pretend to be your husband…
David’s in great shape.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: He’ll protect you. Go on… See the Diva…
get the Stones… See you at the temple… God be with you.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: Korben comes rushing into the airport.
Walking quickly, he scopes the hall looking for Leeloo. A POLICE PATROL
bearing down on the STRIKERS jostles him. The cops open fire. The
strikers dive into the garbage and disappear.</p>
<p><strong>check-in attendant</strong>: Congratulations on winning the
contest.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Hey! I really thought I was going to miss my
flight! Thanks, kid! You put the luggage on the conveyor belt?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Uh… yeah.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Great! Now beat it!</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Excuse me. I was so afraid I’d miss the
flight that I sent the kid here to pick up my boarding card.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: …My cousin David…</p>
<p><strong>check-in attendant</strong>: Your wife?</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Uh, yes… Newlyweds. You know how it is… Love
at first sight. You meet, something goes tilt,. you get married, you
hardly know each other. Right, darling?</p>
<p><strong>leeloo</strong>: Dinoine chagantakat!</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Took the words right out of my mouth. Go on…
I’ll be right with you. It’s our honeymoon. We’re going to use the trip
to get to know each other better.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: I feel so guilty sending her to do the
dirty work. I know she was made to be strong but she’s also so fragile…

<p><strong>stewardess</strong>: You are so lucky… Loc Rhod is the
coolest DJ in the universe.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Listen… I don’t want to be interviewed. I’d
prefer to remain anonymous.</p>
<p><strong>stewardess</strong>: Forget anonymous. You’ll be doing Loc
Rhod’s live show every day from 5 to 7!</p>

on fire right here from 5 to 7! You’ll know everything there is to know
about the D-man. His dreams, his desires, his most intimate of
intimates. And from what I’m looking at intimate is the stud muffin’s
middle name. So tell me my main man… you nervous in the service?</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Uh… not really.</p>
<p><strong>loc rhod</strong>: Freeze those knees, my chickadees, ’cause

<p><strong>loc rhod</strong>: Korben sweetheart do me a favor I know
this is probably the biggest thing that ever happened to you in your
inconsequential life. But I’ve got a show to do here and it’s got to
pop. So tomorrow, when we’re on air, give me a hand… Try to make believe
you have more than a one word vocabulary. OK pal?</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: I didn’t come here to play Dumbo on the
radio. So tomorrow between 5 and 7 give yourself a hand, that clear
pal?</p>
<p><strong>loc rhod</strong>: Crystal.</p>
<p><strong>check-in attendant</strong>: …Mr. Dallas… Korben Dallas?</p>
<p><strong>right arm</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>check-in attendant</strong>: The problem is I only have one
Korben Dallas on my list… and he’s already checked in.</p>
<p><strong>right arm</strong>: That’s impossible! He’s in j… I mean,
there must be some mistake. I have my ticket! I’m the real Korben

<p><strong>check-in attendant</strong>: I’m sorry, sir, boarding is
finished.</p>
<p><strong>right arm</strong>: I want to see your boss! Get rid of this
fucking window! Somebody’s made a mistake, goddamnit!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: This is not an exercise. This is a police
control. Put your hands in the nearest yellow circles…</p>
<p><strong>right arm</strong>: Sorry, my fault… Just a little
overexcited… that’s all… I’m calm now.</p>
<p><strong>leeloo</strong>: Apipoulai!</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Not hard to find you…just follow the
Chaos…</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Leeloo, listen to me… these tickets… they’re
not mine… I mean they are, but not for vacation like everyone thinks…
I’m on an operation… and if I didn’t come get you, you’d be in a
shitload of trouble… I’d love to be on vacation with you… but now…. now
I’ve got to work… And Leeloo… I would love to work in peace.</p>
<p><strong>leeloo</strong>: Love…</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Yes! But “love” isn’t the operative word
here, PEACE is!</p>
<p><strong>leeloo</strong>: Peace… and love…</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Sometimes you can’t learn everything from a
screen..sometimes it’s better to ask someone who has experience..</p>
<p><strong>leeloo</strong>: What is… Make Love?</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Know what? On that subject maybe you’d be
better off asking the screen.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: …to make your flight as short and agreeable
as possible, our flight attendants are switching on the timing sleeper
which will regulate your sleep during the trip…</p>
<p><strong>leeloo</strong>: OK! Finished!</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Finished what?</p>
<p><strong>leeloo</strong>: Learning language.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Which one?</p>
<p><strong>leeloo</strong>: All 900.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: You learned 900 languages in five
minutes?!</p>
<p><strong>leeloo</strong>: Yes! Now it’s your turn! I learned your
language, you have to learn mine!</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: I know how to say “Hello”. Teach me how to
say “Good-bye”, that’s all I need.</p>
<p><strong>leeloo</strong>: Apipoussan!</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Apipoussan?</p>
<p><strong>leeloo</strong>: Good! Do you know how we say “make
love”?</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Uh…</p>

He took my place.</p>

<p><strong>technician</strong>: All right! We’re finally getting
something!</p>
<p><strong>head scientist</strong>: The thing is sending out radio
wavelengths!</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: What the hell does it want with radio
waves?</p>
<p><strong>head scientist</strong>: …Probably wants to make a call!</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Mr. Shadow on the line.</p>
<p><strong>zorg</strong>: Yes… Zorg here.</p>
<p><strong>shadow</strong>: Am I disturbing you?</p>
<p><strong>zorg</strong>: No… not at all. Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>shadow</strong>: …Not far, now.</p>
<p><strong>zorg</strong>: Really? Maybe I can get you on my screen and
see you at last!</p>
<p><strong>shadow</strong>: Do you have the picture now Mr. Zorg?</p>
<p><strong>zorg</strong>: Got it.</p>
<p><strong>shadow</strong>: How’s our deal coming along?</p>
<p><strong>zorg</strong>: Fine, just fine! I’ll have the 4 pieces you
asked for any time now. But it wasn’t easy. My costs have tripled.</p>
<p><strong>shadow</strong>: Money is of no importance… I want the
Stones!</p>
<p><strong>zorg</strong>: The Stones will be here. I’ll see to it
personally!</p>
<p><strong>shadow</strong>: …I can’t wait to be among you.</p>
<p><strong>stewardess</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen, we have begun our

<p><strong>korben</strong>: Pardon me. Excuse me. I’m trying to reach my
wife.. Sorry!</p>
<p><strong>hostess</strong>: Welcome to Paradise.</p>
<p><strong>host</strong>: If you don’t have the code you can’t open
it!</p>
<p><strong>loc rhod</strong>: My main man! Please don’t leave me here
alone. My head’s killing me and my adoring fans are gonna tear me apart!
Get me outta here!</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: I’ll take you to the bar, after that, you’re
on your own.</p>
<p><strong>loc rhod</strong>: Oh, yes! Do that! You treat me right, man.
Tell me all about yourself, your roots, your personal life, your
childhood dreams…</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: I don’t think this is a good time…</p>
<p><strong>loc rhod</strong>: …You got brothers and sisters? What about
your dad? Tell me about your dad! What was he like? Physically? Big, I
suppose?</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Yeah, very big, a giant.</p>
<p><strong>loc rhod</strong>: I didn’t have a dad… never saw him… never
even heard him. 50 billion people listen to me every day… and he doesn’t
hear me…</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: For the concert it says formal attire… I
didn’t bring…</p>
<p><strong>hostess</strong>: Here’s some champagne. I’ll drop by after
the concert to open it.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: You little sleaze bag!</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: …Ma???</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Don’t you ever ask me for another thing in

<p><strong>korben</strong>: …Ma!!!</p>
<p><strong>fog</strong>: The Diva’s ship is coming in.</p>
<p><strong>chief of police</strong>: I want maximum security.</p>
<p><strong>fog</strong>: Yes. Sir!</p>
<p><strong>chief of police</strong>: OK, let’s hear it.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Where was I?</p>
<p><strong>chief of police</strong>: …You open the door. There’s a cabby
with a girl in his arms.</p>
<p><strong>chief of police</strong>: What happened? A bomb go off in
your face?</p>
<p><strong>beat-up cop</strong>: Yeah… A 5 foot 7 inch bomb… with green
eyes.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: And the smile of an angel?</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: May I speak to you alone.</p>
<p><strong>diva’s assistant</strong>: Please forgive this little
incident. She wants you to know that she senses great powers in you… in
the service of a noble cause… She will give you what you have come to
get, but she wants to sing first… One last time…</p>
<p><strong>diva’s assistant</strong>: Miss.</p>
<p><strong>fog</strong>: Hello, I’m head of security. Everything is in
order. You can…</p>
<p><strong>fog</strong>: …make yourselves at home safely. If you need
anything…give it a knock!</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Listen, Ma! I’ve only got a few days
vacation and I’ll be damned if I’m gonna spend them on the phone.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: …Hang on, it’s the door. No! I told you I
didn’t bring anybody! I’m all alone… as usual!</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: …I’ll call you back.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Here we go again…</p>
<p><strong>leeloo</strong>: You know women normally change five times
more than men.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: You get that off the screen?</p>
<p><strong>leeloo</strong>: Yes… you know there’s a lot of differences
between men women.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: You noticed..</p>
<p><strong>leeloo</strong>: OK, you can turn around!</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Where you going?</p>
<p><strong>leeloo</strong>: I’m going to see the Diva sing. What’s the
matter?… Do I look bad?</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: No, not at all! I mean, just the opposite,
you’re… you’re beautiful!</p>
<p><strong>leeloo</strong>: Do you know how this works?</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: I have an idea.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: I told you I need to work in peace.
Remember? I need to concentrate.</p>
<p><strong>leeloo</strong>: And you can’t concentrate with me
around?.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: It’s difficult.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Army issue. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>leeloo</strong>: You’re nothing but a… a…</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: The words you’re looking for weren’t in the
dictionary you studied. I won’t be long.</p>
<p><strong>loc rhod</strong>: Hey Stud we gotta…</p>
<p><strong>loc rhod</strong>: Korben my man what’s happening here? Who’s
the chick? What’s the gig? We free forming here? Getting funky with the
monkey? Can I get in on this?</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: No..to all of the above.</p>
<p><strong>loc rhod</strong>: We have just walked into what is probably
the most beautiful concert hall in the universe. Totally awesome!
Magnificent paintings on the ceiling. I don’t know who painted them, but
he must have busted his balls! I see a row of former ministers, more
sinister than minister! A few generals practicing how to sleep. And
there’s Baby Ray, star of stage and screen, drowning in a sea of
nymphets. He’s not gonna get much out of this concert, he’s
stone-deaf!</p>
<p><strong>baby ray</strong>: …to who?</p>
<p><strong>loc rhod</strong>: …And over there is Roy Von Bacon, the king
of laserball and the best paid player in the League. …And over there is
the Emperor Kodar Japhet whose daughter Aachen is still at the bar. “I
love to sing, too, but in the shower”, she recently confessed to me. She
will no doubt prove to be as generous tonight as she always is.</p>
<p><strong>akanit</strong>: It’s showtime!</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Yeah!?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Flowers for the Diva.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: She’s allergic to flowers!!!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: There’s champagne as well…</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: …My God!</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Commander, I have a ship with a main
malfunction. He requests permission to dock for repairs.</p>
<p><strong>commander</strong>: Did you check out his registration
number?</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Everything’s in order.</p>
<p><strong>commander</strong>: Put him in the docking garage and inform
the police.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Permission granted. Dock 575. You have an
hour. Will that be enough time’?</p>
<p><strong>zorg</strong>: More than enough.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Mangalores! The Diva’s suite! They want
the Sacred Stones! They must be stopped. We must stop them!. I’m going
to free you but you must promise to help me!</p>
<p><strong>mangalore</strong>: I have it.</p>
<p><strong>leeloo</strong>: Apipoulai!</p>
<p><strong>mangalore</strong>: They were waiting for us! It was an
ambush!</p>
<p><strong>akanit</strong>: If it’s war they want it’s war they’ll get!
Enact the Final Plan!</p>
<p><strong>zorg</strong>: My compliments, little lady! …And thanks for
doing all the dirty work! I couldn’t have done it any better myself!
…Now hand over the Stones!</p>
<p><strong>zorg</strong>: Nice knowing you.</p>
<p><strong>zorg</strong>: You can run but you can’t hide…</p>
<p><strong>akanit</strong>: Nobody move! We’re taking over this
ship!</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: I told you…</p>
<p><strong>mangalore 1</strong>: Everyone down!</p>
<p><strong>loc rhod</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen, I think we’re being…
attacked. The place is crawling with warriors.</p>
<p><strong>zorg</strong>: You want something done, do it yourself!</p>
<p><strong>loc rhod</strong>: They’re hideous. They’ve got a crest on
the head, the eyes of a toad and fingers all over their hands. Totally
hideous!</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: …Mangalores!</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Send a battalion out immediately!</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: I was sent by the government to help
you.</p>
<p><strong>diva</strong>: Don’t worry. This is my fate… How was the
concert?</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: I’ve never heard anything so beautiful in my
life.</p>
<p><strong>diva</strong>: You’re a good man… She was right to have
chosen you…</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>diva</strong>: The Fifth Element… The Supreme Being… Your
wife…</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Leeloo… is… she’s…</p>
<p><strong>diva</strong>: Yes, and more than that… You must give her the
Stones, she’s the only one who knows how to use them.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: …So Cornelius was telling the truth!</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Of course I was telling you the truth!…
If you had listened to me in the first place, we wouldn’t be in this
predicament now!</p>
<p><strong>diva</strong>: She needs you. She needs your help and your
love. She’s more fragile than she seems…</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: …Yeah, so am I.</p>
<p><strong>diva</strong>: She was taught to love the life of others… but
not her own. You have to teach her to love if you want her to truly
live!</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: I’ll help her, I promise, but I think you
should tell me where the Stones are!</p>
<p><strong>diva</strong>: Do you love her?</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: I… I don’t know! We hardly know each other…
it takes time!</p>
<p><strong>diva</strong>: I don’t have time… I need to know.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman
I loved her … I never saw her again.</p>
<p><strong>diva</strong>: I would like to have died in peace…</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: You tell me to save the world then you go
off and leave me in the shit!</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Come on! You’re not gonna die in peace!
You’re not going to die at all! You hear me? Where are the Stones?</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: I’m sorry, but… the Stones…</p>
<p><strong>diva</strong>: They are… with me…</p>
<p><strong>mangalore 2</strong>: Stay calm and nobody will get hurt!
Hands on your head and into the hall!</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: …The Stones are with me?</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: …In me?</p>
<p><strong>loc rhod</strong>: Don’t you think we’d better be going?</p>
<p><strong>mangalore</strong>: Hey, you! With the others!</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: That’s it… I’ve had… all day people have
been sticking guns in my face…</p>
<p><strong>loc rhod</strong>: Korben man… These dudes are going to waste
us if we don’t do what they say.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: You don’t do what I say… I’ll waste you
myself. Got it?</p>
<p><strong>loc rhod</strong>: Got it…</p>
<p><strong>akanit</strong>: What’s the situation in the hall?</p>
<p><strong>mugger</strong>: There’s no more resistance. Everything’s
under control.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Everybody down!</p>
<p><strong>loc rhod</strong>: This is amazing! Korben, Korben Dallas,
the winner of the Gemini Croquette contest just killed three warriors
like he was swatting flies…</p>
<p><strong>loc rhod</strong>: It’s Roy von Bacon, the Lions center
forward joining in the battle…</p>
<p><strong>princess aachen</strong>: All this is terribly exciting,
hmmm?</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Toss me the balls!</p>
<p><strong>baby ray</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: The balls for Christ’s sake!</p>
<p><strong>emperor japhet</strong>: He wants the balls! You deaf or
something?</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: How far is he from here?</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: I’d say about thirty yards to the left.</p>
<p><strong>loc rhod</strong>: …And our man Korben has literally knocked
out the opposition with an amazing 90 foot pitch.</p>
<p><strong>fog</strong>: Thanks for your help.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Leeloo???</p>
<p><strong>leeloo</strong>: Kor… ban…</p>
<p><strong>cop 1</strong>: Hey, who are you?</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: The winner of the Gemini Croquette
contest.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Seven to the left. Five to the right.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: What’s he doing?</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Six to the left. One to the right.</p>
<p><strong>loc rhod</strong>: He’s on vacation.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: We got to find the leader. Mangalores don’t
fight without a leader.</p>
<p><strong>akanit</strong>: One more shot and we start killing hostages,
got that?</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Found him…</p>
<p><strong>akanit</strong>: Send someone to negotiate!</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Mind if I go? I’m an excellent
negotiator.</p>
<p><strong>cop 1</strong>: Uh… Sure, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>cop 1</strong>: We’re sending someone in who’s authorized to
negotiate.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Anyone else want to negotiate?</p>
<p><strong>cop 2</strong>: Where’d he learn to negotiate like that?</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: From us!</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: You’re probably very angry with me and I
quite understand. But I want you to know I’m fighting for a noble
cause.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Yeah, I know… to save the world… but right
now all I want to do is save Leeloo.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Leeloo’s in trouble?</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: When is she not in trouble?</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Uh.. Have you tried the Diva’s suite?</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: More trouble?</p>
<p><strong>zorg</strong>: Nothing I can’t fix myself.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Leeloo?</p>
<p><strong>leeloo</strong>: Korben…</p>
<p><strong>loc rhod</strong>: Korben man… what the hell is this?</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: A molecular bomb.</p>
<p><strong>loc rhod</strong>: And, uh, what’re these numbers clicking
by?</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Probably the time remaining before it
explodes.</p>
<p><strong>loc rhod</strong>: You’re just saying that to scare me!
Right? If it was a bomb, an alarm would’ve gone off. There’s bomb
detectors in all these hotels!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: This is a Type A alert. For security reasons
the hotel must be evacuated. Please proceed calmly to the lifeboats
located in the main hallways.</p>
<p><strong>loc rhod</strong>: Maybe we oughta be going, what do you
think?</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Not without Leeloo.</p>
<p><strong>loc rhod</strong>: Like D-Man, I hate to bother you but uh,
like, we’re down to 2 minutes here…</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: It’s the latest model.. I’ve never seen one
before… it works off a magnetic coded card… Let’s see if I can rig it
up.</p>
<p><strong>loc rhod</strong>: Hey! What are you doing? The bomb!</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Don’t worry, I’m here now!</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Just relax. I’ve got the Stones.
Everything’s going to be fine.</p>
<p><strong>loc rhod</strong>: Like Korben, can I have 30 seconds of your

<p><strong>korben</strong>: I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>zorg</strong>: Allow me…</p>
<p><strong>zorg</strong>: Just for the fun of it.</p>
<p><strong>zorg</strong>: Well, what do we have here? Is this Korben
Dallas? The famous winner of the Gemini Croquette contest? Or is this
Korben Dallas from Special Section sent by old Lindberg himself.</p>
<p><strong>zorg</strong>: …In any event, whoever you are, I was glad to
meet you.</p>
<p><strong>zorg</strong>: …A 3000 round clip! I didn’t fire off 3000
rounds… did I?</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Don’t you know how to count. It’s not all
that hard. Watch!</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: One! That’s for trying to kill me!</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Two! That’s for firing me! Three! That’s for
pushing around a priest! And the rest is for what you did to my
wife!</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: We’re outta here!</p>
<p><strong>loc rhod</strong>: Are you nuts, Father? That hurts! I can’t
feel my teeth.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Doesn’t matter all you need are your
legs.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Two minutes to complete evacuation…</p>
<p><strong>zorg</strong>: I didn’t fire three thousand rounds…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: One minute to total evacuation…</p>
<p><strong>loc rhod</strong>: You know how to fly this thing?</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: It’s like a cab isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: 30 seconds…</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Anyone know how to release the lines on this
crate?</p>
<p><strong>zorg</strong>: Maximum Protection.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: 6… 5…</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Found it?</p>
<p><strong>loc rhod</strong>: I don’t even know what I’m looking
for!</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Fuck it! Hold tight!</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Solid little jobs, aren’t they?</p>
<p><strong>loc rhod</strong>: Dear listeners, your favorite DJ is alive
and kicking. It’s seven o’clock and time for the news. Tune in tomorrow
for another adventure.</p>
<p><strong>vocoder</strong>: Beep. End of transmission.</p>
<p><strong>loc rhod</strong>: The best show I ever did!</p>
<p><strong>zorg</strong>: How’s that? Can you hear me better now?</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So,
how was the concert?</p>
<p><strong>zorg</strong>: Who gives a shit! I didn’t come here to listen
to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries
on my phone are almost gone.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Yes, Sir!</p>
<p><strong>zorg</strong>: Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately.
Someone stole mine.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Right away, Sir. I’ll send you a new one
to the hotel.</p>
<p><strong>zorg</strong>: I’m not at the hotel!</p>
<p><strong>zorg</strong>: Hello?…</p>
<p><strong>beeper</strong>: Battery dead.</p>
<p><strong>zorg</strong>: Stay calm…. stay calm…</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: Major Dallas has the Five Elements on board.
The priest is guiding them directly to the temple.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Thank God! We’ve been saved!</p>
<p><strong>scientist</strong>: Mr. President.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Yes? Now, what?</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: What do you mean, “its advancing”?!</p>
<p><strong>commander</strong>: It’s not only advancing, but it’s moving
at incredible speed! We’re having trouble following it.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: …And… Do you have any idea where it’s
heading?</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Apipoulai..</p>
<p><strong>leeloo</strong>: I’m so very sad.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Why? We did pretty well, wouldn’t you
say?</p>
<p><strong>leeloo</strong>: Five hundred wars… Arms… Drugs… Money…
Everything you create is used to destroy…</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: I told you not to read all that crap!</p>
<p><strong>leeloo</strong>: Protect life… Until death.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: There’s a General on the phone… His
name’s Mambo, I think.</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: Munro here. President Lindberg wants to talk
to you. Hold the line.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Major, first off, I want to thank you, in
my name and in the name of the Federation…</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: For the praiseworthy courage you have
shown us! I’d like to congratulate General Munro for his choice. He
found the ideal man for such a…</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: So now what’s the problem?</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: There’s a ball of fire 1,200 miles in
diameter heading straight for the earth. And we have no idea how to stop
it! …That’s the problem.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: How much time before the collision?</p>
<p><strong>scientist</strong>: If its speed remains constant… in an hour
and 57 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: I’ll call you back in two hours.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You’re all safe. Thanks be to God!</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Later, David! Later! There’s not a minute
to lose!</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Excuse me, Father, but… could we pray
later?</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: They just landed in the desert.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: How much time is left?</p>
<p><strong>scientist</strong>: About nine minutes.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Uh, this one… must be water!</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Don’t tell me you don’t know how all this
works?</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Theoretically, yes! The four Stones form
the beam and the Fifth Element is supposed to stand in the middle there,
but… I don’t have the reference book. I’ve never seen the Stones
work!</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Match the symbols!</p>
<p><strong>loc rhod</strong>: What is this some kinda game? Like
chess?</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: No. It’s much simpler. If we don’t figure
out where these Stones go in five minutes, we’re all dead! Think you got
it?</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: There’s no light! You told me there were
supposed to be four beams of light.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Yes, of course, but… The Stones are shut!
They have to be open for it to work.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: And you don’t know how they open, is that
what you are saying?</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: That’s what I’m saying.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Leeloo? The Stones! We have to open them!
How does it work?</p>
<p><strong>leeloo</strong>: The wind blows… the fire burns…</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: I know all that, Leeloo! I’m talking about
the Stones.</p>
<p><strong>leeloo</strong>: …The rain falls…</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: The rain falls… the wind blows?</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Try and figure out how this fucking thing
opens, instead of staring at me like that!</p>
<p><strong>loc rhod</strong>: I’m looking, I’m looking.</p>
<p><strong>scientist</strong>: …Three minutes.</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: We’ve lost contact with them.</p>
<p><strong>loc rhod</strong>: …we’ll never make it.</p>
<p><strong>loc rhod</strong>: It… it moved! Korben! Korben!</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: What did you say? What did you do?</p>
<p><strong>loc rhod</strong>: Nothing! Swear to God, I didn’t do
nothing!</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Look, you did something that set it off. Try
to remember. Concentrate. Tell me exactly what you did!!</p>
<p><strong>loc rhod</strong>: I was like this… With my hands here and… I
said, “We’ll never make it!” That’s all!</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Is that all?</p>
<p><strong>loc rhod</strong>: Yeah… then I sighed… like this.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: The wind! The wind blows…</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Quickly, everyone on a Stone! Water for
water! Fire for fire! Earth for earth!</p>
<p><strong>loc rhod</strong>: I don’t have a light. I stopped smoking
last week! If we’d come a bit sooner…</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Don’t breathe.</p>
<p><strong>scientist</strong>: Two more minutes.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: It’s up to you now, Angel!</p>
<p><strong>leeloo</strong>: I’m so tired…</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: You can sleep tomorrow… come on…</p>
<p><strong>leeloo</strong>: I want to sleep… forever…</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Leeloo! Listen to me! I’ll take you on a
vacation afterwards! A real vacation, this time, for as long as you
want. Come on! You can do it!</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Come on Leeloo! Come on!</p>
<p><strong>scientist</strong>: It’ll be entering the atmosphere in one
minute.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Leeloo! If you don’t get on with the program
we’re all gonna die! And that’s not on my agenda for today.</p>
<p><strong>leeloo</strong>: What’s the use of saving lives… when you see
what you do with them!</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: You’re right but there are lots of good
things… beautiful things…</p>
<p><strong>leeloo</strong>: …Like love…</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>leeloo</strong>: But I don’t know love… I’m like a machine
programmed to save other people’s lives but never to have one of my
own.</p>
<p><strong>leeloo</strong>: I have thousands of memories but none of
them are mine… There is no need for me other than this. I’m immortal but
I have no life.</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Yes, you do! I need you. More than you can
imagine! Stand up straight!</p>
<p><strong>leeloo</strong>: Why?… Why would you need me?</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Because…</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Tell her, for God’s sake!</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: Because…</p>
<p><strong>leeloo</strong>: Tell me…</p>
<p><strong>korben</strong>: I love you…</p>
<p><strong>leeloo</strong>: Now you’re allowed to kiss me.</p>
<p><strong>scientist</strong>: The planet seems to have stopped at… 62
miles from impact.</p>
<p><strong>loc rhod</strong>: This guy is a killer with the babes. I
knew it from the moment I laid eyes on him.</p>
<p><strong>munro</strong>: Mr. President, let me introduce you to
Professor Mactilburgh, who runs the center.</p>
<p><strong>mactilburgh</strong>: It’s an honor to receive you.
Mr. President.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Yes.. Well? Where are our two heroes?</p>
<p><strong>mactilburgh</strong>: They were so tired from their ordeal
that we put them in the reactor this morning..</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: I have 19 more meetings after this one
Professor..</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Of course.. Let me see if they’re
revived.</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: We go live in one minute, Mr. President.</p>
<p><strong>mactilburgh</strong>: I.. uh.. they need five more minutes,
Mr. President.</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: No ma’am… I tried… No ma’am…</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: Some woman… claims she’s Korben’s mother…</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Give it here…</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Mrs. Dallas, this in the President. On
behalf of the entire Federation, I would like to thank…</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Don’t pull that crap with me, Finger… I’d
recognize that trash can voice of yours in a dark alley during a rain
storm. You tell that worthless no account son of mine he should plotz
for the way he’s ignored his mother… when I think of all I sacrificed
for him…</p>
