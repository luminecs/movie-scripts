<p><strong>evan</strong>: If anyone finds this, then I guess my plan
didn’t work and I’m already dead…</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: But if I can just go back to the beginning of
all this, I still might be able to save her.</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: Okay, okay… what now?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: We’re gonna be late again.</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: When did you ever care about getting to
school on time?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: We’re putting up pictures for Parent’s
Night.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Righty-tighty, lefty-lucy.</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: Thanks. Don’t worry Evan, you’ll have plenty
of time.</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: Darn it!</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Um… can dad come this time?</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: You know the answer to that.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Can’t he come out for one day?</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: We’ve been over this a hundred times. It’s
too dangerous for him.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: But Lenny said that his dad’s coming… and
Tommy and Kayleigh’s dad…</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: Here, Ev… Finish this up for me.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: All the dads are gonna be there.</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: I get the point, kiddo. But I’m not so bad,
am I?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: Good. Because I’ve been waiting to see your
art projects all week and I’d feel terrible if all you thought about was
your father not being there.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Done. Try it.</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: You’re amazing, kiddo.</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: Okay have a great day I love you I’ll pick
you up later gotta go…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. boswell</strong>: Mrs. Treborn! I need to speak with
you!</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: I’m sorry, but can it wait til tonight? I’m
already late for work –</p>
<p><strong>mrs. boswell</strong>: I think you really need to see
this.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. boswell</strong>: I was going to show this to the
principal, but I wanted to talk to you first.</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. boswell</strong>: Yesterday I had all the children draw
pictures of what they wanted to be when they grew up. Most of them made
drawings of what their parents did, but this…</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: I don’t understand… Evan did this?</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: Thank you for showing it to me first. I’ll…
I’ll take care of it. Can I have the picture?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. boswell</strong>: Of course. There is one more thing,
Mrs. Treborn. And I feel bad for mentioning it…</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. boswell</strong>: When I asked Evan about his drawing,
well, he didn’t remember doing it.</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: I have to go.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: You put the mommy too far away. Mrs. Boswell
has macaroni and glue if you wanna fix it.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You’re such a retard!</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: Mommy lives far away but she comes and
visits.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: If I’m retarded, why didn’t my mommy move
away from me?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Hey, what’d you do that for?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Fat little baby, crying for mommy.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Come on, Lenny. It’s not that bad. You can
still see your mom a little.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Can… can… Can I have this?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Sure. I was gonna make a new one, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>dr. redfield</strong>: And you say he doesn’t remember any of
it?</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: Not according to his teacher. It just got me
thinking about Jason and what if Evan’s inherited his father’s
condition?</p>
<p><strong>dr. redfield</strong>: Hold it, hold it, Andrea. Let’s not
jump to conclusions. I’ll run some preliminary tests, see what we can
rule out.</p>
<p><strong>dr. redfield</strong>: Tell you what, bring Evan here tonight
and we’ll run a CAT-scan series.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: I don’t like this place, Mom. It’s creepy.
Please can we go? I promise I won’t make any more bad pictures!</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: You’ll be fine. Dr. Redfield just wants to
give you some tests. You’ll like him.</p>
<p><strong>dr. redfield</strong>: Hello, Evan. It’s very nice to meet
you. He’s as handsome as his father.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: You know my father?</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: That’s why I wanted you to come here, Evan.
Dr. Redfield already has a background in memory loss.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: My father has a bad memory, too?</p>
<p><strong>dr. redfield</strong>: Uh, tell you what, Evan. If it’s okay
with your mother, I’d like to run some tests. Nothing scary.</p>
<p><strong>dr. redfield</strong>: Okay, it might be a little scary…</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: Just tell me that Evan doesn’t have Jason’s
illness…</p>
<p><strong>dr. redfield</strong>: Look, Andrea, I’m sure he’ll test
negative for brain disorders. But there’s something else you can try to
monitor his memory.</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: Anything.</p>
<p><strong>dr. redfield</strong>: A journal. Just have him write down
everything he does.</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: Why? What for?</p>
<p><strong>dr. redfield</strong>: It could be extremely useful to jog
his memory. See if he remembers anything new the next day. And I’ll have
the test results back in a few days.</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: Thanks, George. I really appreciate you
watching him, he won’t be any trouble at all.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: These’ll bring you luck, Crockett.</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: Great. I’ll see you soon.</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: Evan?</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: Evan? What are you doing with that
knife?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: Honey. What were you doing with that?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: I… I don’t remember.</p>
<p><strong>mr. miller</strong>: Hey, Andrea. Hello little man.</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: Thanks a lot George. Here’s my work number
in case there are any problems.</p>
<p><strong>mr. miller</strong>: Whaddaya kidding? We’re going to have a
great time today, right Evan?</p>
<p><strong>mr. miller</strong>: You waiting for an invitation? The kids
are inside.</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: Evan, guess what? Dad got a new video
camera and we’re all gonna be in a movie.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I don’t think Evan gets to be in it –</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: Quit it, Tommy. Evan gets to be Robin
Hood. I’m gonna be Maid Marian, and you’re the Sheriff of
Nottingham!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I thought I was the bad guy!</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: You are, silly. He’s a bad sheriff.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: We’re really gonna be in a movie!?</p>
<p><strong>mr. miller</strong>: That’s right, Evan, and you get to be
the star.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I thought I was the star.</p>
<p><strong>mr. miller</strong>: Shut up, moron. Now get in your costume,
Evan. And you have to promise, your bestest super-duper promise, that
this will be our little secret. Think you can do that?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Where am I? What happened? Where did we all
go?</p>
<p><strong>mr. miller</strong>: Calm down, kid. Stand still.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: I was just somewhere else – how did I get
here?</p>
<p><strong>mr. miller</strong>: Quit acting like some retard or I’ll
call your mother and tell her what a naughty little shit you’ve
been.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Kayleigh? What happened?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: What’s wrong with me?</p>
<p><strong>dr. redfield</strong>: Well, the good news is that the
results are negative. I’ve found no evidence in the way of lesions,
hemorrhaging, tumors…</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: And the bad news?</p>
<p><strong>dr. redfield</strong>: Unfortunately, we’ve got nothing to
work with. It’s harder playing detective now.</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: But you must have something to go on?</p>
<p><strong>dr. redfield</strong>: If I had to guess, I’d say the
blackouts are stress related.</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: But he’s seven. What kind of stress can he
have?</p>
<p><strong>dr. redfield</strong>: Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he’s got
severe coping problems about not having a father. Did you say the last
blackout occurred when he was with his friend’s dad.</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: Come on, I doubt the answer’s that
simple.</p>
<p><strong>dr. redfield</strong>: You’d be surprised how often they
are.</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: Well, he has been pushing me to meet his
father, but I’ve been putting it off.</p>
<p><strong>dr. redfield</strong>: It’s worth a shot. I can arrange a
controlled meeting. A careful dose of sedatives for Jason, some
security, you and I monitoring. Evan comes in for a quick visit and with
any luck, no more missing father complex.</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: How soon?…</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Dad lives here?</p>
<p><strong>dr. redfield</strong>: Not in this wing, actually. No.</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: Now your father may seem sleepy to you, but
that’s just because of his medicine, okay?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: It’s okay. I won’t bite. You’ve seen pictures
of me, right?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Uh-huh. Mom says I have your eyes and your
–</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I… love… you.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: He has to die! You don’t understand! It’s the
only way to stop it!</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: I’m sorry, Evan. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Ashes to ashes… dust to dust.</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: You’re better off anyway.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Tommy, I’m bored shitless over here. What’s up
already?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Hold your horses, man. It’s here somewhere. I
saw it when I was a kid.</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: We should go soon. If Dad catches us
smoking down here, we’re dead.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: So let’s go. This place creeps me out.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I knew it had something to do with the
army.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Let’s blow the shit out of something!</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Guys, slow up, would you?</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: Evan, did I tell you? My mother said I
might be able to visit her this summer in Orlando with her new
family.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: What did I say about mentioning that
bitch?</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: Where the hell are you taking us anyway?
Just blow something up already.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Just blow something up? Are you nuts? There’s
an art to mass destruction. Would you just paint the Mona Lisa?
No. Besides, we’re here already.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Here you go, buddy.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: What? No frigging way, man. I’m not touching
that thing.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: The hell you aren’t. Anyone of us does it,
you’ll puss out and narc for sure.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Ain’t gonna work this time, buddy. Look how
small that fuse is! I’ll get killed.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Not necessarily.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: That should buy you ten minutes at least.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Gee, thanks friend.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Oh, for Christ’s sake, just do it, Lenny.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: You got balls, man.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Hurry! Let’s go! Get him up, Evan! Come
on!</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: What happened?? Where are we?!</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: Oh God… what did we do?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Shit, Lenny. What’s happened to you! We’ve
gotta get help!</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: What is it? What happened?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: We were just building a fort in the woods
when Lenny freaked out. One minute he was fine, then he just froze up.
Right guys?</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: What happened, Evan? The truth.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: I don’t know… I don’t remember.</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: Something must’ve happened! What set him
off?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: I… I blacked out.</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: Don’t try to use your blackouts to get out
of this one!</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: You’re not making this up, are you?</p>
<p><strong>dr. redfield</strong>: With every breath you exhale, you can
feel all of the tension draining from your body like water through a
faucet. Nine, ten, and you’re completely asleep. Relaxed.</p>
<p><strong>dr. redfield</strong>: Now I want you to go back to the time
you were in the woods with Lenny. Think of it like a movie. You can
pause, rewind, or slow down any details you wish. Understand?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>dr. redfield</strong>: Where are you now?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: I’m standing next to Kayleigh, my hands are
over her ears.</p>
<p><strong>dr. redfield</strong>: Are you hurting her?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: No, protecting her.</p>
<p><strong>dr. redfield</strong>: Okay. Then go a little forward in
time. What do you see now?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: I see a car.</p>
<p><strong>dr. redfield</strong>: Yes, tell me about the car.</p>
<p><strong>dr. redfield</strong>: Go on. Nothing can hurt you. Remember,
this is only a movie. You’re completely safe.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: I can’t… the car vanishes and all of a sudden
I’m on the ground in the woods.</p>
<p><strong>dr. redfield</strong>: The car doesn’t vanish Evan. The movie
in your head has broken, that’s all. But now I’ve re-spliced it and I
want you to tell me about the car.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: It’s coming… argh! I can’t!</p>
<p><strong>dr. redfield</strong>: Fight it Evan. Hurry. It’s coming!</p>
<p><strong>dr. redfield</strong>: Okay, Evan. Listen to my voice! On the
count of ten, you’re going to wake up. Feeling refreshed and remembering
everything we talked about.</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: What’s happening to him?? Make it stop!</p>
<p><strong>dr. redfield</strong>: One. You’re feeling more awake now.
Two, your eyes no longer feel heavy.</p>
<p><strong>dr. redfield</strong>: Five. Six. Refreshed and awake! Seven,
eight. Come on, Evan, wake up, dammit!</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: Evan wake up, oh please wake up!</p>
<p><strong>dr. redfield</strong>: Nine, ten. And you’re awake! Open your
eyes, dammit!</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: What happened? Did it work?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Wipe that sad-assed look off your face before
you get us all busted. You see the way Evan’s mom was looking at
you?</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Would someone just tell me already what the
hell happened in the mailbox?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Don’t ever bring that shit up again. Not
ever. Not to me, not to Kayleigh, or even Lenny. The stupid fuck if he
ever learns to talk again. Understand?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Ever. She don’t want to talk about it,
anyway. Do you Kayleigh?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: There it is. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>anchor</strong>: …was the grizzly aftermath of what police
officials of upstate New York are calling a horrible act of vandalism
gone awry.</p>
<p><strong>anchor</strong>: The powerful explosion is believed to have
been caused by a small quantity of dynamite.</p>
<p><strong>anchor</strong>: Police thus far have no leads as to the
suspects…</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Holy shit! Look at that fat fuck! You’d have
to wipe his ass with a forklift!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Shut up, faggot. No one’s talking to you!</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: I’m sorry Kayleigh. This was a bad idea.</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: You really don’t remember anything that
happened?</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: You’re so lucky.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: It’s going to be okay. Lenny’ll be fine.
You’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: Ouch.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: It’s not your fault. Mrs. Kagan called dad
and blamed us for what happened to Lenny.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Damn. Your dad did this?</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: I deserve a lot worse.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: What are you talking about? What you deserve
is a better brother and father. All they do is make you feel like
shit.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: You really have no clue how beautiful you are,
do you?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: What the fuck are you doing??</p>
<p><strong>teen punk</strong>: Buying popcorn, what the fuck are you
doing?</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: So how was the movie?</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: Any exploding mailboxes?</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: We’re moving.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: I can’t believe Tommy’s still pissed at me. He
knows I’m moving away, right?</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: He’s been acting real strange lately. He
won’t even look me in the eyes anymore.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Duck, here they come.</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: Did your mom say if Lenny was… okay?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: He must be. They’re letting him go, right?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Welcome home, Lenny!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. kagan</strong>: I think your little homecoming’s in bad
taste.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Sorry?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. kagan</strong>: Lenny’s been through a hell of an ordeal
no thanks to you.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Welcome home. Thought you might like some
fresh air for a change.</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: Hi, Lenny.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Is Tommy with you guys?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: It’s cool.</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: So what did you do in there?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: It was awful. You can’t sleep ’cause
everyone’s screaming all night long. I never want to go back.</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: Do you see that?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Crockett!!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Look what you made me do!</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: What’s wrong with you?!</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Kayleigh! Wake up!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Why don’t you fucking kiss her, Prince
Charming!</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: How long was I out?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Kayleigh?! Are you okay? Where’s Crockett?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. kagan</strong>: Do you know what you are? A monster.</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>professor carter</strong>: Time! Please place your blue books
on my desk before you leave.</p>
<p><strong>professor carter</strong>: How’d you do, Evan?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: I’m not sure. I might have gotten some stories
mixed up. Did Pavlov condition his dogs to lick his nuts?</p>
<p><strong>professor carter</strong>: Typical psych major. A complete
wise ass. And how’s your project coming? Still planning to change the
way we humble scientists view memory assimilation?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Hey, I got no choice.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Whoa. Smells like patchouli and… ass.</p>
<p><strong>thumper</strong>: Cricket, meet my well-mannered roommate,
Evan.</p>
<p><strong>cricket</strong>: Yeah, you’re the one who fucked up the
bell-curve on my Anthropology final. Later, Thumper.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Nice to meet you, too.</p>
<p><strong>thumper</strong>: Here, bro. Found your T-shirt.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Get dressed, Thumper, you’re taking me out for
my birthday.</p>
<p><strong>thumper</strong>: I thought you were a December baby.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: This is bigger. Seven years to the day. No
blackouts.</p>
<p><strong>thumper</strong>: Let’s do this.</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: So… which one of you has a pet worm?</p>
<p><strong>thumper</strong>: Worms, plural.</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: That’s so gross.</p>
<p><strong>thumper</strong>: Talk to him about it, he’s got the
fetish.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Actually, they’re for a psych project. A study
on memory.</p>
<p><strong>heidi</strong>: Shit, better explain before all the
excitement gives me a heart attack.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: It’s an experiment with flatworms and a maze.
You take a flatworm and run it through the maze until he’s memorized it.
Then you put a new flatworm in the maze. He’s clueless. Banging into
walls, getting lost, whatever.</p>
<p><strong>thumper</strong>: Like Ozzy.</p>
<p><strong>spencer</strong>: Ten bucks says he eats it off the
floor.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: You chop up the smart flatworm and feed it to
the dumb one and presto, the dumb one suddenly knows the maze inside and
out.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Just by absorbing the first worm into its
cellular structure, it gets all of the worm’s memories.</p>
<p><strong>thumper</strong>: That’s probably why Hannibal Lecter’s so
smart.</p>
<p><strong>heidi</strong>: So what’s the point?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Maybe if I can figure out how the memories of
a simple worm function, it’ll help me understand the complexities of the
human brain.</p>
<p><strong>heidi</strong>: So are you planning on becoming a doctor or
something?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: No, I just don’t want to lose my mind.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: I think that’s your game.</p>
<p><strong>heidi</strong>: Smells like sex in here.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Thumper had a busy afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>heidi</strong>: You’re kidding. He’s so… big.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Charisma and eyeliner go a long way, I guess.
Wanna beer?</p>
<p><strong>heidi</strong>: Most guys tuck their porn under here, but all
you have are… comp books.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Yeah. I’ve been keeping journals since I was
seven.</p>
<p><strong>heidi</strong>: Wow… read something.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: No way, I’d be too embarrassed.</p>
<p><strong>heidi</strong>: Then keep drinking, worm-boy. You’re too
uptight.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Freeze! No “worm-boy”. No “Mr. Worm,” and no
“Worm-Master-General!” Once you get a nickname like that you can’t shake
it. And I don’t want everyone thinking I’ve got tapeworms coming out of
my ass or something, okay?</p>
<p><strong>heidi</strong>: Deal. Now read me something.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: For courage.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: It’s like my mind refused to believe what it
was seeing. Hearing Crockett make those awful screams… Just writing
about it gives me the shivers.</p>
<p><strong>heidi</strong>: Come on, go on…</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: It was like Tommy was possessed or something.
There was a hate in his eyes that I couldn’t really call human.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: What the hell is going on?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: I can’t undo the rope!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Drop it or I’ll slit your mother’s throat in
her sleep.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: I got him, Lenny. Help Crockett!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Listen to me good, Evan. There’s a million
other sisters in the world. You didn’t have to fuck with mine.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Oh my God! No! No!</p>
<p><strong>heidi</strong>: Wake up, idiot. It was just a dream.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: It didn’t feel like a dream.</p>
<p><strong>heidi</strong>: Maybe because they never do. So Don Juan, you
pass out on all your dates?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. kagan</strong>: I’ve got a surprise for you, Lenny.
You’ll never guess who’s here.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Hey, uh, it’s me. Evan.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: What’s that you’re working on? A model?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Well, you look busy, so maybe I should make
this quick. I’d totally understand if you didn’t want to get into this
right now, but that day at the junkyard, could you help me remember what
happened? Any details?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: I couldn’t cut the rope.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Yeah, good, what else do you remember?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Drop it or I’ll slit your mother’s throat in
her sleep.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Jesus Christ. It really happened.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: What if I can get back all my lost memories
with my journals.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Make one peep and I swear it’ll be your last,
motherfucker.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Well, thanks for seeing me, man. I shouldn’t
have waited so long.</p>
<p><strong>thumper</strong>: You really think he wanted to kill you?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: All I know is that I might be able to unblock
some of my repressed memories.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: The last thing I remember before the blackout
was holding my hands over Kayleigh’s ears… I think I was more focused on
her hands on mine than the mailbox across the street…</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Maybe it went out. Should someone check
it?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Yeah, you do that, Lenny.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Make one peep and I swear it’ll be your last,
motherfucker.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. halpern</strong>: How’s my sweet girl? Awww, you need a
change, don’t you honey?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. halpern</strong>: You want to open the door, honey?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: C’mon! Run!!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Lenny? Come on!</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: Oh my God oh my God…</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: What the hell?</p>
<p><strong>thumper</strong>: Christ, man. You wanna clean that up before
I lose my appetite here?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Yes, hello, uh, Mrs. Kagan, this is Evan
Treborn. I know. I’m sorry about that. But I really need to speak with
him.</p>
<p><strong>professor carter</strong>: Whoa! Didn’t mean to scare you,
Evan. Just wanted to know how the flatworms project was coming.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Oh, fine I guess. It’s been kind of crazy
lately with my mom coming up, so I haven’t…</p>
<p><strong>professor carter</strong>: I know, I know. Who can think of
worms when your libido’s in full swing, right?</p>
<p><strong>professor carter</strong>: Just don’t drop the ball,
okay?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: I won’t let you down, Professor Carter.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Please, mom. People will talk.</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: I can’t help it. I’m just so proud of you.
You’ve got the highest grades in all of your classes.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Did Da – Jason — get good grades?</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: Please. He got straight A’s without ever
touching a book. That was the one area where his memory never failed
him.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Ma? Did he ever say that he figured out a way
to recall a lost memory years after he blacked it out for the first
time?</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: Why do you ask?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: No, it’s just weird with him being such a
brain and all, I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff
he’d forgotten.</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: When he was around your age… almost exactly
your age. He said he figured out a trick to remember the past.</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: I couldn’t tell if they were real memories
or just phantoms. You know, he might only have thought he actually
remembered them…</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Sure…</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: And then, just before it got so bad that he
had to be committed, he said that he could…</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: What? What could he do?</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: Forget it. It’s nothing. He was far too sick
by then.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: I never wanted to be in the movie anyway and
it was cold so I wanted to wear my clothes but Mr. Miller took his shirt
off –</p>
<p><strong>thumper</strong>: What the fuck are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Shhh! I need quiet for this.</p>
<p><strong>thumper</strong>: Are you stupid or what?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>thumper</strong>: Shucks, I dunno. But maybe there’s a reason
why you’ve repressed the one day when some old lecher had you in your
tighty whities, dammit!</p>
<p><strong>thumper</strong>: Yeah, man. I’d think twice about this. You
could wake up a lot more fucked up than you are now.</p>
<p><strong>boss</strong>: Can we get through one goddamned day without
you breaking something?</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: God, Evan! I never thought I’d see you
again. How’ve you been?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Oh, comme si, comme ca, you know…</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: No, Evan. I don’t know. It’s been a long
time. Fill me in.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: I’m going to State now. Things are going okay.
I guess. Mom’s good…</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Not since we were kids.</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: I’ve stopped a hundred times.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: So how’s Tommy?</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: They kept him in juvy for a few years. Now
he works over at Dale’s Autobody.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: You still live with your dad?</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: No. I emancipated myself when I was
fifteen.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Wow. That must’ve taken some courage.</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: Not if you remember my dad.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Couldn’t you have moved in with your mom?</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: She had a new family. Not enough space for
me. Said I should have moved in with her when we were kids. But…
whatever.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Actually, Kayleigh, the reason I came back to
town was to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: Me? Are you kidding? Why?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Remember when I was a kid I had all these
blackouts?</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Well, lately some of the memories have begun
to come back and I’d kinda like to talk to you about one of them in
particular. It’d be a big help.</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: Well, sure. I’ll try to remember.
Shoot.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: When we were kids. Your dad was making a
movie. Robin Hood or something?</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: What do you want to know, Evan?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: It’s just… did he… what happened in the
basement?</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: It was a long time ago.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: I know, but…</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: Is that why you came all the way back? To
ask a lot of stupid questions about Robin Hood?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: No, but I think something really bad might’ve
happened to us.</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: Is there a point to any of this?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Whatever happened, it wasn’t our fault. You
know we couldn’t have stopped it.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Look, Kayleigh. This may sound like bullshit
coming from a guy who hasn’t spoken to you in seven years…</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: But you were seven years old and there’s
nothing you could’ve done to deserve…</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: Just shut up, Evan. You’re wasting your
breath.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: You can’t hate yourself just because your
dad’s a twisted freak.</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: Who are you trying to convince, Evan?! You
come all the way out here to stir up my shit just because you had a bad
memory!? You want me to cry on your shoulder and tell you that
everything’s all better now? Well fuck you, Evan! Nothing’s gonna be all
better! Okay?! Nothing ever gets better!</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: If I was so wonderful, Evan, why didn’t
you ever call me? Why’d you leave me here to rot?!</p>
<p><strong>thumper</strong>: Some dude left a message for you.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: You can smell it all the way in the
bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>answering machine</strong>: Hi, Evan, this is Professor
Carter. Just wondered why you didn’t hand in your essay this afternoon.
I was a bit concerned. Call me to schedule a make-up.</p>
<p><strong>answering machine</strong>: What did you say to my sister
motherfucker?! Last night she cried on the phone for over an hour to me.
She said you came and saw her last night.</p>
<p><strong>answering machine</strong>: She… she fucking killed herself
tonight. She’s dead. And so are you.</p>
<p><strong>thumper</strong>: Whoa, bad news, bro. I don’t think this is
gonna come out.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: It’s been said that a person’s life is little
more than the sum of his experiences. If that’s true, then I’m not sure
I know who I am anymore. I definitely never knew Kayleigh.</p>
<p><strong>mr. miller</strong>: Shut up moron. Now get in your costume
Evan.</p>
<p><strong>mr. miller</strong>: I’ve got an idea. Let’s go downstairs,
it’ll look more like a dungeon down there.</p>
<p><strong>mr. miller</strong>: What did I say about keeping that door
closed, stupid?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: But I wanna see!</p>
<p><strong>mr. miller</strong>: You’re gonna see my fist in about two
seconds unless you do what I tell you.</p>
<p><strong>mr. miller</strong>: Now in this part of the story, Robin
Hood just married Maid Marian and they have to kiss and stuff like
grown-ups do.</p>
<p><strong>mr. miller</strong>: So take your clothes off Kayleigh.</p>
<p><strong>mr. miller</strong>: Come on, like when you take a bath.
Don’t make a deal out of it. You too, Evan.</p>
<p><strong>mr. miller</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>mr. miller</strong>: It’s time for you to stand where the
hell I told you.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Wrong answer, fuckbag. This is the very moment
of your reckoning. In the next thirty seconds you’re going to open one
of two doors. The first door will forever traumatize your own flesh and
blood.</p>
<p><strong>mr. miller</strong>: What’s happened to – How are you doing
that?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: It’ll change your daughter from a beautiful
child into an empty shell whose only concept of trust was betrayed by
her own sick pedophile father. Ultimately, it’ll lead to her suicide.
Nice work, daddy.</p>
<p><strong>mr. miller</strong>: Who – who are you?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Let’s just say you’re being closely watched,
George. Your other option is to get your porn off the rack and treat
Kayleigh like… oh, let’s say like how a loving father treats his
daughter. Sound okay to you, Papa?</p>
<p><strong>mr. miller</strong>: …yes.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Listen close then, fuckbag. You screw up again
and I swear I’ll flat out castrate you.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: One last thing.</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: Don’t you ever touch me again.</p>
<p><strong>mr. miller</strong>: I – I won’t.</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: I’m cold. And I’m putting on my
clothes.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: What you need to do is discipline your son
Tommy, because the kid’s one sadistic pup.</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: Honey, are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: Oh my God, Evan. You’re bleeding! Look at
you!</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Jesus, Kayleigh, you’re… Incredible.</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: Mmmm… You give good compliment. Clean up
and come back to bed.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Where… where are my clothes?</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: Those are your clothes, silly.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: This is too amazing! Un-fucking-real!</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: I wish I could get so excited about a
nose bleed.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Whoops. Sorry. My bad.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Hey, you were with those assholes who threw
popcorn at Thumper.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: And your name is… Gwen!</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Seriously, Evan. Lay off the blow.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Hey, uh, don’t go freaking out on me over
this, but do you remember when your dad first got his video camera?</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: Well I remember he had one… but he, like,
put it away after the first day. Why would that freak me out?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: I dunno. Just being weird.</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: Such a goofus. See you tonight.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Come on, Mom, be there!</p>
<p><strong>answering machine</strong>: Andrea, Evan, And Chuck, Aren’t
home right now. You know what to do.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Hi, Mom and, uh, Chuck. Just calling to say hi
and well, call me.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Thumper! What time is it, man?</p>
<p><strong>thumper</strong>: Whasamatter? Lost your Rolex?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>thumper</strong>: Fuck off, frat boy.</p>
<p><strong>professor carter</strong>: Remember, everyone! Only two weeks
until your science projects are due.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: I still owe you an essay from last week. Is
there any way I could get an extension?</p>
<p><strong>professor carter</strong>: And you are…?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Evan Treborn.</p>
<p><strong>professor carter</strong>: The answer’s ‘no’, Mr. Treborn.
Now take a seat. The exam’s about to begin.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Leave me alone, asshole. I didn’t lay a hand
on you, okay?</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: Evan, you’re hysterical. You study for
this?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: We’ll find out soon enough.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: Me neither.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: You’re kidding. Are these the answers?!</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: Damn, Evan, on the D.L.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Thanks. Wow. Hey, I want to do something
really special for Kayleigh tomorrow. If I said I needed some help from
you and the brothers…</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: I’d say blow me. Get the pledges to do
it.</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: Oh my God, that was good. Where’d you
learn all those new tricks?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: So it didn’t feel… weird?</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: Yeah, if you call multiple orgasms
weird.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Yellow.</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: Fuck ’em.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: What do you think it is about us that makes us
so perfect? Like, looking back, whatever gave you the nerve to sneak out
and visit me after I moved away?</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: As if my dad could’ve stopped me from
seeing you. What’s he gonna do to me?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: You think we’ll always be together?</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: That is the plan, right? Hell or high
water?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Just making sure.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Order, order. So all you rushes know what
you’ve got to do for me?</p>
<p><strong>theta chi pledge</strong>: Pledges, Sir Brother Evan,
Sir.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Pledges, rushees, same difference. Now this is
a one-time deal. You do all this for me and I’ll never give you shit
again. Promise.</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: I don’t understand, where are you taking
me?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: You’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: I don’t know what to say. It’s
beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Go on. Sit down.</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: Why are you doing all this for me?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Simple math. When I woke up this morning and
saw your smile… I knew that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with
you.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: We been lookin’ all over for you, man.</p>
<p><strong>senior brother</strong>: Someone trashed your car.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Did you see who did this? You see anyone?</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: Probably them Pika fuckers.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: How could he get away with this? Right in
front of the goddamn frat house!</p>
<p><strong>senior brother</strong>: Frat house? Hey man, would you call
your “country” a “cunt”?</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: Don’t. He’s probably watching.</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: It’s my fault. I should have told you he
was released a few weeks ago.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Might’a been nice. Like this is gonna do any
good. Maybe one of the frat guys has a gun.</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: Please, Evan. Don’t even joke. He wouldn’t
hurt you. He’s just trying to scare you away from me.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Yeah, right. Tell that to Crockett.</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: It’s not his fault, Evan. You knew how bad
he had it when we were kids.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Don’t give me this Oprah-book club bad
upbringing shit, because you turned out fine.</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: My father never laid a hand on me. It’s
like the prick saved it all up for Tommy.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Fine, then. We’ll let campus security deal
with him.</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: It’s just… you’ve been acting kinda
strange, you know?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Like how?</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: I don’t know. You seem… different. You
make weird jokes. Your accents changed. You don’t even walk the
same.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: I walk differently?</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: I can’t put my finger on it, but
everything’s a bit off. Even the dinner tonight. It was beautiful,
but…</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: I know I’ve been actin strange lately. It’s
just that… I don’t want anything to happen to us.</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: Wait. Something’s not right. Isn’t that
your jacket?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: Tommy.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Leave us alone you sick fuck!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Get this “us” shit. As if I was gonna lay a
hand on my own sister. You’ve done nicely for yourself, Evan. Nice
friends, nice life, not to mention you’re fucking my sister. Not a bad
piece of ass if I say so myself.</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: Shut up, Tommy!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Aw, hey now, that was a compliment.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: What the hell are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: It wasn’t enough that the whole world loves
you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn’t think
I was a piece of shit.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: No one thinks you’re a piece of shit,
Tommy.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Right, Evan. I believe you just said “sick
fuck.”</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: Evan, stop! You’re gonna kill him!</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: He’s a fucking maniac!</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: He ruined Lenny’s life –</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: He killed Crockett – Murdered that woman and
her baby! And he’s trying to kill me, Kayleigh! He’s trying to fucking
kill me!</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: First time?</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Best not bitch up. Wind up someone’s luggage
that way.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Can you protect me?</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Jesus himself couldn’t make me take on the
Brotherhood. When they come, just put your mind in another place, man.
Be somewhere else.</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: …I spoke to your new lawyer about the
appeal. He’s sure he can get you off on self-defense, so if you’re
patient.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: How long will I be in here?</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: I don’t know. These things take time.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: How’s Kayleigh doing? She all right?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: What about my journals, Mom? Did you bring the
ones I asked for?</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: I found these. The others are still in
storage.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Damn it, Mom. I told you I need them all!</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: Fine. You’ll get them, Evan. But I think
it’s far more important to focus on your case right now.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Sure, Mom. You’re right. Just try to tell
Kayleigh I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: I’m not gonna lose you, kiddo. Promise me
you’ll hang on, Ev.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Shit on my dick or blood on my knife.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Let go! They’re mine!</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Motherfucker!</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: We’ll be comin’ for you tonight, sister.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Today I found my grandfather’s death
certificate. He died in a nut house, just like my father. Mom denies it,
but she thinks I’m gonna end up the same way…</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: You’re religious Carlos, you believe that bit
about “the Lord works in mysterious ways?”</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Straight up.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Because I think he sent me to your cell on
purpose. For you to help me.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Shit. I knew you were crazy.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: I ain’t bullshitting. Jesus speaks to me in my
dreams.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Pack of smokes says I can prove it to you.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: So when I’m out, I need you to watch my face
and hands closely.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: You need to see the prison shrink, man.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Anything today?</p>
<p><strong>convict</strong>: Yep. Just not for you.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Just tell me if anything weird happens.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Weirder than this?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Marks, scars, I dunno. Anything could happen I
guess.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. boswell</strong>: No monkey business, Evan. Sit still
and finish your drawing.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. boswell</strong>: That’s great everyone! Just imagine
anything you want to be. There are no limits.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Oh, Mrs. Boswelllllllll?</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Oh sweet Jesus. It’s true. It’s a miracle! A
miracle!</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Your hands. The stigmata!</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: What did you see? What did it look like?</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Signs of the Lord. They just appeared out of
nowhere. I thought you were loco!</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: So you believe me?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: I want to make a deal.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Look. I’m new to all this but I think I get
how things work. You gotta join a gang or else end up dead meat.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Well it sure ain’t gonna fucking be with no
niggers or spics. So how do we do this? You gotta work your way up, and
I’m the new guy. So… should I… I mean, do I suck your dicks right
now?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Is your blood pure?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: I ain’t no fucking kike if that’s what you
mean.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Let’s see what you got. And watch the fucking
teeth or you’ll be leaving without ’em.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Carlos!</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: We took the woods behind the junkyard just to
make sure we wouldn’t bump into Tommy. We hadn’t seen the smoke yet.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Rot in hell you fucking animals.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Wait. Before we –</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: We need something to cut open the sack!</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: I want you to take this, Lenny. Today’s your
day of atonement. I know how guilty you feel about that woman and her
baby –</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: Evan. Stop it. It’s not the time.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Now’s the only time! Today you get a chance to
redeem yourself. Start over with a clean slate. Tabula rasa –</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: You’re acting crazy!</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Please. If you’ve ever trusted me before,
trust me on this one.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Cut the rope.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Listen to me good, Evan…</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: I’ll do whatever you want. You don’t want me
to ever see Kayleigh again, fine. Just let Crockett go. Besides, you
kill him now and they’ll stick you in juvy for sure. And I know you’d
never leave your sister alone with your father.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Oh fuck, Lenny, no!</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Christ. Help me.</p>
<p><strong>thumper</strong>: Someone call 9-1-1!</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Okay, doc. What’s the damage? How much time
have I got?</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: Cute, Evan.</p>
<p><strong>dr. redfield</strong>: It’s a little complicated. I haven’t
seen results exactly like these before.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Are you sure? Not even with my father?</p>
<p><strong>dr. redfield</strong>: Actually, these tests weren’t
available twenty years ago.</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: So what did you find.</p>
<p><strong>dr. redfield</strong>: This is where we’re finding most of
the hemorrhaging. The outer lining of the cerebral cortex.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Lemme guess. Would that be where the memories
are stored?</p>
<p><strong>dr. redfield</strong>: I’ve never seen anything like this.
I’ve compared these to the ones taken last year, and there’s evidence of
severe hemorrhaging and massive neural reconstruction.</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: What does that mean for Evan?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: He’s saying it’s like forty years worth of new
memories have been jammed in my brain since last year. Overload city.
’Sat about the gist of it, doc?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Mind if I wait in the car? The lighting here
bugs my eyes.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Well, it’s nice seeing you again. But you
know, people to see, things to read…</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Is there anything you need? Anything I can get
you?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: What about the models, man? Bet I can get you
a shitload of models up in here.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Okay, Lenny. Just wanted to say “hi”.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: You knew the whole time, didn’t you? When you
put the blade in my hand, you knew something big was going to happen.
Didn’t you?!</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Y… yes. I guess I did.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Then you should be where I am. You should be
where I am.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Today I get to meet my father. His name is
Jason and he is crazy…</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Are you okay? You looked like you were
somewhere else for a second there.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Look, Jason, I need some fast answers if I’m
ever gonna fix what I’ve done.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I was praying this curse would have ended
with me.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: But it didn’t. And now I need info to make
things right again and you’re the only one who can give it to me.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: There is no “right”. When you change who
people are, you destroy who they were.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Who’s to say you can’t make things better?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: You can’t play God, son. It must end with me.
Just by being here, you may be killing your mother.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Bullshit. I’ll send you a postcard when I’ve
made everything perfect again.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Just get out, didja?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Nothing. Just that my brother did a stint
in the pen and he used to eat like that.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: I come from a big family.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Meant no offense.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: None taken. Hey, uh, does Kayleigh Miller
still work here?</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Sorry. Never heard of her.</p>
<p><strong>mr. miller</strong>: Just shut the hell up already! Can’t a
man get a little goddman peace in his own home! Oh, for Christ’s sake,
now what?</p>
<p><strong>mr. miller</strong>: Don’t suppose you’re here to sell
cookies?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Good guess, fuckbag. Remember me now? We had a
great chat once when I was seven.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: One question, fuckbag. Where can I find your
daughter?</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: Oh, I thought you were my eight o’clock.
Make it fast, I’m expecting someone.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Nice to see you, too. Can I come in?</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: If I knew you were coming I’d have cleaned
the stains off the sheets.</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: I just needed to see… a friendly face.</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: Well, time is money, Evan. So you…</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: Well, I guess I can spare ten minutes for
an old friend, right?</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: So how’s tricks? Sorry, occupational
humor.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: I get it. You can drop it now.</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: Oh, I’m sorry. Does my line of work make
you uncomfortable, precious?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: No. Just that you need to hurt me with it.
I’ve been where you’ve been.</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: Ha! Where’s that?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: The bottom. When you’re just a piece of meat
waiting for the next attack.</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: What’s happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: You wouldn’t believe me. I mean, people always
say, “You wouldn’t believe me”, but in this case, it’s not even worth
trying.</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: I’ve seen some sickening shit. I don’t
blink twice anymore, especially in your case.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Why’s that?</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: Because you’re… different.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Different? How?</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: Let me ask you a question. Just a little
one that’s been gnawing at me for years.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: On the bridge. How did you know that Tommy
had your dog? That was no fucking hunch.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Do you remember when I was a kid and I had
those blackouts?</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: You’re right, Evan, I don’t believe
you.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: I never thought you would. That’s why I’ve
never bothered to tell a soul until now, and why I never will again.</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: I’m the only person you’ve told? That’s a
great line. Does that make other girls swoon? Do they actually eat up
this bullshit?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: I couldn’t give a shit if you believe me or
not, and frankly I’m too tired to prove it to you.</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: Oh? There’s proof now?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Shit. I dunno. How would I know about the twin
moles on your inner thigh?</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: Anyone with fifty bucks could tell you
that.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Then forget that. How about… you prefer the
smell of a skunk to flowers, you hate cilantro because for reasons
unknown to you, it reminds you of your step-sister.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Oh! And when you orgasm, your toes go numb.
I’m sure your clientele aren’t privy to that one.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: I just thought you should know.</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: Know what?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: That I didn’t leave you there to rot.</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: There’s one major hole in your story.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Which is?</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: There is no fuckin’ way on this planet or
any other that I was in some fuckin’ sorority.</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: Sure you don’t want your wallet?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Don’t think I’ll need it where I’m going.</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: Off to change everyone’s life again, is
that it? Maybe this time you’ll pop up in some mansion while I wind up
in Tijuana doing the donkey act.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: I’m over it. Whenever I try to help anyone it
all turns to shit.</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: Well, don’t give up now, Slick. You’ve
already done so much for me. Hell, why don’t you go back in time and
save Mrs. Halpern and her baby. Then maybe Lenny wouldn’t freak out and
ruin my family.</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: Oh, here’s one! Go back when I’m seven and
fuck me in front of Daddy’s handicam, you know, straighten me out a
bit…</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Get out. Both of you.</p>
<p><strong>thumper</strong>: Sorry, dude. Just figured it’d be okay with
you bein’ sick and all.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: I’m not saying it again.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Lord give me the strength and guidance I need
to set things right.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Lady, stay back! Don’t go near the
mailbox!</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: I mean it, woman! Get the hell back!</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: There’s a bomb in the mailbox. Get away!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I’ll save you lady!</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: I thought I told you two to beat it.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: What? Hey, sorry, man. We wake you up?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: No, it’s cool. Really cool.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Where are we going?</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: We have to get you to Sunnyvale. You’re
having one of your famous hemorrhages.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Stop! Take me back!</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Sorry, tough guy, no can do. Your mother
would kill me.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Take me back, Lenny! You owe me that much.</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: What are you geeks looking at? Must be
nice to be so goddamned perfect, huh? Fucking losers.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: ’Sup, Sheila! We missed you at the party!
Don’t even think I’m giving you my lab notes either! Think I like
getting up for “eight thirty’s”?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Hey, there’s Tommy.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I did what you said, man! We’re pooling our
student funds with Hillel House and we’re going to have an Awareness
Dance.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Oh goody, nothing like spinning my chair
around to a techno mix of Hava Nagila til I puke.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Uh, we should be getting to class now.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Forget it. What’s the point of Psych now?
Tomorrow I could wake up as some dirt farmer in Bangladesh.</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: Let’s go for a stroll.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: So Tommy’s really into this Jesus kick,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: You know how spiritual he’s gotten ever
since he saved Mrs. Halpern and Katie.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: He saved Mrs. Halpern? Please, the twisted
fuck.</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: Is something the matter?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Yeah, I think I gotta get these fixed or
something.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Kayleigh? Do you ever think about “us?” I
mean, wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of
us?</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: Sure, Evan, why not? You were the first
person I really ever cared about.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: I was?</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: That’s why when I was little I never went
to live with my mother.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: I don’t get it.</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: When my folks split, they gave me and
Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. I couldn’t stand my dad, but
I knew if I moved to my mom’s I’d never see you again.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: I never knew that. So then you still sometimes
think of us… together?</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: It’s crossed my mind from time to
time.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: And…?</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: Well a lot of things cross my mind. I’ve
always been a fast thinker, Ev. I can play out the movie of our entire
lives in under a second. Boom – we fall in love – get married – two
kids, your keen analytical insight matched to my generous nature – kids
grow old as do we, relatively stable relationships, matching burial
plots, the whole bit. It took a lot longer to spit out than to
imagine.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Then you think it might have worked out?</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: Why not? But that’s not how things wound
up. I’m with Lenny, Lenny’s your friend. And there it ends.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Would it make any difference if I told you
that no one could possibly love anyone as much as I love you?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You forgot to put the toaster on the
edge.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: But you, Kayleigh and Lenny like toast. And
that’s really all that matters now.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I’ll get you changed. Visiting hours are
almost up.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: What, did mom get transferred again?</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: Looking. Good. Kiddo.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Lung cancer?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Sorry, Mrs. T. He’s been out of sorts
lately.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Right… You started chain smoking after I blew
myself up.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: There must be a way to fix this.</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: Fix?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: I just need the entry about the blockbuster.
Wait, shit, no arms. I never even got the chance to write it.</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: Is Evan… different?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: He’s just going through some tough times.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Mom. Don’t cry. I can change this.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I think I’ll go check out the chapel.</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: You’re. Acting. Like your father.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Come on, Mom. Just ’cause Dad was my age when
he started going crazy doesn’t mean that I’m nuts.</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: How. Did you. Know that?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: You told me that on Parents’ Weekend.
Remember? Wait, that wasn’t me. Or you.</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: Just. Like. Jason.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Don’t worry. I’m gonna get you out of
here.</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: Stop him. Stop him. Stop him…</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Are you sure you even packed it?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: My mom packed for me. I think she sent
everything I ever owned. So we’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Is this it?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: What do you need it for? I don’t get you
lately.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Duly noted. Now I’m gonna ask you for one last
favor.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Shhh. I need to concentrate on the blockbuster
if I’m gonna destroy it.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Destroy it?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: If I hadn’t blown my arms off, Mom never
woulda started smoking in the first place. Now shhhh.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Yes. Now how do I destroy the blockbuster?</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: Evan? What are you doing with that
knife?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Well, that didn’t work…</p>
<p><strong>mr. miller</strong>: Now in this part of the story, Robin
Hood just married Maid Marian and they have to kiss and stuff like
grown-ups do.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Wait! I need my belt!</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Loo loo, skip to my loo. Loo loo, skip to my
loo.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Loo, loo, skip to my loo.</p>
<p><strong>mr. miller</strong>: Hey kid, don’t bother with the belt.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Back off, fuckbag!</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Amazing. That word never fails to make an
impression with you…</p>
<p><strong>mr. miller</strong>: Easy does it, Evan! Don’t be a bad boy
or I’ll tell mommy you were naughty.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: And I’ll tell the Child Protective Services
about your kiddie porn endeavors. One step closer and I’ll shove this up
your ass!</p>
<p><strong>mr. miller</strong>: That’s dangerous! You could blow your
hands off!</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Been there, done that.</p>
<p><strong>mr. miller/tommy/evan</strong>: Kayleigh! NOOOOOooooo!</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Oh God, Kayleigh…</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Kayleigh… no! You can’t die again! I won’t let
this happen. I won’t!</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Where are they?!</p>
<p><strong>dr. redfield</strong>: Hey, Evan. What’s the big rush? We
don’t meet for another hour.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Where are my goddamn books?</p>
<p><strong>dr. redfield</strong>: Books?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: My journals! Where are they?</p>
<p><strong>dr. redfield</strong>: It kills me to have to go through this
again. There are no journals. There never were. It’s part of this
fantasy world your mind created to cope with the guilt of killing…</p>
<p><strong>dr. redfield</strong>: Think Evan. You’ve invented a disease
that doesn’t exist. Alternate universes with colleges, prisons,
paraplegia…</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: But I… I need those books.</p>
<p><strong>dr. redfield</strong>: You remind me of your father. He
always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Photos?</p>
<p><strong>dr. redfield</strong>: Jesus, no.</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: No dances, just tell me.</p>
<p><strong>dr. redfield</strong>: The hemorrhaging… the neural damage is
irreparable. I’m frankly surprised he still has use of his motor
functions.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Hey, Mom, didja remember to bring those goofy
old home movies we used to make?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: If anyone finds this, then I guess my plan
didn’t work and I’m already dead.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: But I – I can just go back to the beginning of
all this, I might be able to save her.</p>
<p><strong>dr. redfield</strong>: He’s not in his room. Search the
grounds.</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: Go on, Evan. Introduce yourself.</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh</strong>: When my folks split, they gave me and
Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. I couldn’t stand my dad, but
I knew if I lived with my mom, I’d never see you again…</p>
<p><strong>andrea</strong>: He’s not usually this shy.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: I hate you. If you ever come near me again,
I’ll kill you and your whole family.</p>
<p><strong>kayleigh’s mother</strong>: What did you say to her? What
happened?!</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: You alright? Should I call the doctor?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: I’ll think I’ll be alright this time. I really
do.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: You sure about this?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Yeah, Ma. I’m running a little late for lunch.
One of my patients had a breakdown. Anyway, order some soup in the
meantime. See ya soon.</p>
