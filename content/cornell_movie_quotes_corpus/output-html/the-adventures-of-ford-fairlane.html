<p><strong>vomit</strong>: Wha-<u>at</u>!… No, no, I can’t do it
tomorrow. I’m taping a Rock Against Drugs spot. It’s important to
me…</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Five minutes, Mister Vomit.</p>
<p><strong>vomit</strong>: Thanks, man… Don’t worry, Johnny, I have it
with me now. I’ll just put it in a little protection program. He can’t
stop us, man, no way.</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: Peek-a-boo!</p>
<p><strong>vomit</strong>: Now, Zuzu, didn’t I tell you to lay off the
coolers?</p>
<p><strong>crowd of thousands</strong>: Vomit! Vomit! Vomit!</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: So I had this dream, right. You guys were
doing that song, ‘I Love You More Than My Own Death,’ right, when all of
a sudden these penguins come on stage and tell the audience that I used
to wet my bed. And that I enjoyed it. It was so real … How ’bout a kiss,
Bobby?</p>
<p><strong>vomit</strong>: Sure. Babe.</p>
<p><strong>grendel</strong>: Vomit. Vomit. Vomit.</p>
<p><strong>grendel</strong>: Nice of you to drop by, Mister Vomit.</p>
<p><strong>vomit</strong>: Please don’t spank me, Mister Grendel.</p>
<p><strong>vomit</strong>: Drown in hell, you deaf motherfucker!</p>
<p><strong>grendel</strong>: Sticks and stones…</p>
<p><strong>vomit</strong>: But I thought you couldn’t hear?</p>
<p><strong>grendel</strong>: Oh Robert , you’re so predictable, I don’t
have to.</p>
<p><strong>vomit</strong>: Let’s do it, man.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Welcome, sluts and perverts, I give you,
Black Vomit!</p>
<p><strong>vomit</strong>: Hello, L.A.</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: You people are disgusting. Don’t you
remember the Roman empire?</p>
<p><strong>man in hat</strong>: So who the hell is this Ford Fairlane
fuck?</p>
<p><strong>jaime</strong>: Guy’s a rock star who don’t play a note of
music. Carries a gun instead of a guitar… Am I right, Larry?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Wasn’t always a detective though, Jaime.
Started out doing every shit job in the biz; chauffeur, roadie,
publicist, Phil Spector’s bodyguard…</p>
<p><strong>man in hat</strong>: If I wanted a biography, I’d eat a
librarian. What does he look like?</p>
<p><strong>jaime and larry</strong>: Like that…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Hey, Spike, I was sorry to hear about your
cat. Those U.P.S. trucks are pretty wicked.</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: Thanks, man.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: If you need somebody to talk to…</p>
<p><strong>club gal</strong>: You son-of-a-bitch!</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Whoa. Another satisfied customer.</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: Ford, I gotta ask you to put that out,
dude. Nobody smokes anymore.</p>
<p><strong>twin sister</strong>: What goes for my sister, goes double
for me. Don’t you remember the Jacuzzi, Laurel Canyon, the Guns and
Roses video wrap party.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Yeah, yeah… but you weren’t identical.</p>
<p><strong>twin sister</strong>: You said you’d call us…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Let me give you my number, it’s 555-6023.</p>
<p><strong>twin sister</strong>: Thanks! Wait. 555’s not a real number.
They only use it in the movies…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: What in the fuck do you think this is? Real
life?</p>
<p><strong>man in hat</strong>: That’s Fairlane! He doesn’t look so
tough.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Yeah, well, just don’t call him
Mr. Rock-N-Roll Detective…</p>
<p><strong>drunken boy #1</strong>: Ford Fairlane, Mr. Rock-N-Roll
Detective!</p>
<p><strong>drunken boy #2</strong>: Let us buy you a drink, dudeski.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: You two loony guys, what are your names? Neal
and Bob? Or is that what you do? Tell me, are you driving home
tonight?</p>
<p><strong>drunken boy #1</strong>: Uh, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Go-o-o-d… Don!</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: So many assholes, so few bullets.</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: Damn, Ford, you’re the most cynical man in the
industry and that’s not easy.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I’m not cynical. Can I help it that life is a
disease and everyone’s a victim. So you’re producing exclusively for
Grendel Records now. Hope you’re taking Julian for a bundle.</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: Man, ever since old Jack Grendel died, Julian
has got me into one yummy gig after the other. Not only am I producing,
he’s got me in some lovely-bullshit-money-money executive position. What
are you looking at…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Some redhead’s been harassing that all-girl
group, the Ovaries. Hanging out at their concerts saying he wants to
rape and kill them and not in that order. Cops won’t do anything until
he actually does something.</p>
<p><strong>melodi</strong>: You’re that guy, the private eye.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: You’re a poet and didn’t know it.</p>
<p><strong>melodi</strong>: Do you really know everybody in the
industry?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Only on a first name basis.</p>
<p><strong>melodi</strong>: That’s cute. You’re funny.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: That’s funny, you’re cute.</p>
<p><strong>melodi</strong>: You heard that Bobby Vomit O.D.’d, right? Do
you suspect foul play and stuff?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I’ll tell you when somebody pays me to give a
shit and stuff.</p>
<p><strong>melodi</strong>: My name’s Melodi, as in ‘a pretty girl is
like a.’ Whatever you’re doing tomorrow… cancel.</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: You gotta shave before you leave the house in a
dress like that and I don’t mean your legs. Why didn’t you jump on her?
What’s happening to you?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I guess I’m not interested in any club who’ll
have my member as a member. Later, Don…</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: You better have that vodka milkshake done.
Here comes Mr. Rock-N-Roll Detec – Hi, Ford.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Not thick enough, but better. You’re
definitely getting better, Harry. Hey, if it isn’t Mutt… and Mutt. Who’s
your friend?</p>
<p><strong>jaime</strong>: Just some guy named Sam…</p>
<p><strong>man with hat</strong>: Yeah, I’m just some guy named Sam,
asswipe.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Reminds me of that song by the all- girl
group, the Ovaries, ‘Some Guys Eat Reindeer.’ What. A. Tune! But what’s
that lead singer’s name. I’m drawing a fucking blank here…</p>
<p><strong>man with hat</strong>: It’s Stuh – Sta – Sta – Stac –</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Shall we da-ance?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: So finally got a tip that paid off. Why can’t
you sleazebags who harass women take ‘no’ for an answer? I mean, hey,
it’s never happened to me personally…</p>
<p><strong>sam the sleazebag</strong>: Last… Dance… Mr. Rock-N-Roll
Detective.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>sam the sleazebag</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: You’re ten seconds away from the most
embarrassing moment in your life.</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: Come on Ford, this shit’s getting old.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Clint Eastwood… I fucked him.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Jesus, Jazz, I’m coming. So I’m late. I go to
work when you go to bed.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Fairlane, you gonna find out who killed the
lead singer of Black Vomit?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Tell me, Dr. Watson, what makes you think he’s
not just another piece of shit overdose.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Gut feeling.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I’ll give you a gut feeling, you little… Hey…
<u>hey</u>! Get that stick out of your mouth. These things are killers,
man. Don’t you go to school, listen to Smokey the Bear and all that…</p>
<p><strong>sam the sleazebag</strong>: You sick fuck!</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Bone appetit.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: When you going to let me work with you? Why
you always fucking with me?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Why am I what? Excuse me? I catch you saying
the F-word again. I’ll kill you. That’s a fucking promise. Now get the
fuck out of here.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: I got something serious to dis-cuss.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Well what is it? I’m not Kreskin.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>sam the sleazebag</strong>: You can’t prove shit…</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: Good morning she said as the clock struck
five. I sent the Ovaries down for food. They’ve been waiting for
hours…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Your tip paid off. Jazz, this is Sam the
Sleazebag. Sam the Sleazebag, this is Jazz, my secretary.</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: Assistant. And don’t call me Jazz.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: All your friends call you Jazz.</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>jzaa</strong>: Hey, IN X S paid today. Their ‘payment’ is
around here somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: They paid? I love Australia! What a band!
Let’s throw a Foster’s on the barbie and call up me mates… Cash or
check?</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: You wish.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Cash or check, Jazz? Don’t do this to me.</p>
<p><strong>ovary one</strong>: Hey, Ford, little late.</p>
<p><strong>ovary two</strong>: That’s him! That’s the bastard. He
flashed us at the Ampitheatre.</p>
<p><strong>sam the sleazebag</strong>: I love you. You sluts have no
proof!</p>
<p><strong>ovary three</strong>: I think I could identify it. It looked
like a dick. Only smaller.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: We could gab about evidence and restraining
orders all day, but I think castration is really the way to go. May get
a wee messy…</p>
<p><strong>ovaries &amp; sam the sleazebag</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: It’s a new by-law for pathetic jerks who
harass women.</p>
<p><strong>ovary four</strong>: Do we get to keep it?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Of course. Every girl should have one.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Next time, it’ll be your burrito.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I doubt he’ll be hassling you anymore, but
hey, I’ll save the hedgeclippers anyway.</p>
<p><strong>ovary one</strong>: Great job, Ford. Take this. As payment.
It’s solid gold and it’ll make sure you’re not late for your other
clients.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: No really. Money is fine.</p>
<p><strong>ovary two</strong>: Great gift idea, Stace.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: But…</p>
<p><strong>ovaries</strong>: ’Bye, Ford…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I do it for love.</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: ‘Bye Ford…’ Hey, let me cheer you up. I found
the IN X S payment.</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: G’day, they say it’s worth three grand…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Fucking Australians! I hate that country,
continent, what is it? Don’t we do nuclear testing there?</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: Let’s just declare war on the hellhole. Before
they make <u>Crocodile Dundee</u> three.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Rock stars! I’m going out of my mind. All I
get are perks. I don’t make money, I make gifts. How am I supposed to
pay taxes with bathtub compact disc players and autographed drumsticks.
I want cash. Moulah. Wampum. Dead Presidents. Andrew Jackson. Gerald
Ford.</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: You’re saying you need money.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Car insurance costs money. Cavities cost
money. Doritos cost money. I’m gonna eat that damn bear… come here!</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: Quit crying. I think we’ve got a case if we
can make it through the cavalcade of bimbos, here…</p>
<p><strong>squeaky bimbo</strong>: Hi, this is Vikki, you know, Vikki. I
figured you probably washed off my phone number before you had a…</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: Bim-bo.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Cut the play by play.</p>
<p><strong>obnoxious d.j.</strong>: This Chevy Nova? Chevy Nova, there?
Huh? Huh? Johnny Crunch, K.O.D.S. , you schmuck? You know the guy who
had sex with your prom date <u>before</u> the prom and needless to say
before he became the hottest D.J. in the West. I gotta case for you,
man. Come down to the station about six.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Johnny Pinzolo calling himself Johnny Crunch.
Knock me out. We grew up together in Brooklyn. Came out here to be rock
stars… Of course, he’s lying about the prom date thing, at least I hope
he is, I took his sister.</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: You’re friends with the most obnoxious asshole
on the airwaves. The King of the Shock Jocks. I’m, I’m shocked.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I love you, too, baby. He wants to meet at
six. What time is it now?</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: Six. Take it, you need it.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: K-O-D-S is going to make me rich!</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: That’s for me… Radio contests, really Ford,
how tacky…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Ah – ha… You know, you should think about
dating Earthmen again.</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: So what about this watch?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Keep it. It’s your paycheck this month.</p>
<p><strong>johny</strong>: Ye-e-e-a-a-ah!</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Nothing like a tender ballad sung by a girl
pretending to be a virgin. I’m sorry, young girls should not be out
making records; they should be in, setting records making out. Naked. On
my coffee table. Are you offended? Well, slurp this…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I’m here to see Johnny.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Lucky you. Arnie… Mr. Crunch has a lot
of fans who hate his guts.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Oh, Arnie, sometimes when we touch, the
honesty’s too much.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: And don’t forget, if we call and you answer
the phone ‘K-O-D-S is going to make me rich,’ you could win a cool
million. Sexually transmittable disease jokes are coming up next hour so
go get your mom. Better yet, I’ll get her…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I don’t believe it. Getting paid to be the
asshole you always were.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Fucking amazing, huh? Chevy Nova, you
Bensonhurst shit! Still in La-la land. Look at us, two rock ‘n’ roll
dicks. Unfortunately, only one of us is a detective.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Nice getting all those phone calls from you
after you hit it big, you Redhook bastard.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I don’t remember any Arbor Day cards from
Mr. Rock ‘n’ Roll Detective.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Friendship’s a lot different out here. A wrong
number is a relationship. But then this isn’t a social call.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: How nice.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: It’s my daughter, man. I know I never told
you about her, but God, I love that girl. She calls herself Zuzu Petals
and she’s been swallowed up by the gorgeous hell that is L.A. A fucking
groupie partying with the pros. You have to get my baby back, she’s my
pride and –</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: ’Bye, Johnny…</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: Dead air, Johnny…</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Will you people leave me alone! I’m
contemplating my life and you just won’t stop listening! Here’s five in
a row played at the wrong speed.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: So…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I don’t take cases with foundations in
bullshit. They are very hard to walk around in.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Just find her, man. She’s my daughter, she’s
my sister, she’s my mother, she’s some little brat I stood in line with
at Taco Bell last week. Do whatever you want with my words. And my
money.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I am told it is difficult to pay the phone
bill with gold chains and V.C.R.s. There’s four thousand here.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Zuzu Petals. Sounds like a drug. A lethal
one.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I hope you solve the case and I know you
will, because you’re the best. Ford, guys like you don’t grow on
trees.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Here’s to you…</p>
<p><strong>ford and johnny</strong>: … sucking my dick.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: No dessert until you’ve finished dinner.</p>
<p><strong>feeble woman</strong>: Johnny, why can’t you play different
kinds of music?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I think the real question here, ma’am, is
‘Are you wearing panties?’ A-a-a-h!</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Why did I take it? Because he’s my friend. But
I never liked the bastard. Why did I say yes? Four thousand reasons.
Right, buddy?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: There are 5,000 private investigators in L.A.
It made sense to specialize. Why did I pick the music industry? Why not
fishermen? Fishermen get up, fish, sell the fish, then go to bed so they
can get up and fish. How hard can the cases be: ‘Ford, somebody switched
the lures in my fucking tackle box.’ ‘Ford, my bait’s been
sabotaged.’</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Well, it’s time to sign off. I know I get on
the radio and say a lot of harsh things but I want you to know, deep
down, I hate you, each and every one of you, so until tomorrow, burn
in…</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Oh, my god, somebody just shot my engineer!
Oh, hey, they’re doing something with my mike! Hey, I’m being
electrocuted! And it hurts!</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Call the police! Johnny’s being
electrocuted!</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Oh, please. He’s just doing one of his
little jokes…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Look at the lights…</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Oh-fucking-shit-my-Christ-I’m-
<u>dying</u>!</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Hey, he can’t say ‘oh-fucking-
shit-my-Christ-I’m-dying’ over the air!</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Well, I hope this guy signed your
yearbook because it looks like your friendship, and your case, is
closed.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I think I’m going to cry.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Crying’s good, Ford. Crying’s good.</p>
<p><strong>detective and ford</strong>: Hoh shit.</p>
<p><strong>lt. amos</strong>: How’d Mr. Rock ‘n’ Roll Detective boogie
his way in here? Anybody…</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: He discovered the body, Lt. Amos,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Nice tie, Lt. Anus, sir.</p>
<p><strong>lt. amos</strong>: You think you’re so hot just because you
can get into any club. You think you’re so hot, just because you have
sex with great- looking women. You think you’re so hot just because you
broke the Ensenada tape piracy ring…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: You gotta admit those are all pretty great
reasons…</p>
<p><strong>lt. amos</strong>: Get the fuck out of here, honey… What do
we got?</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: This guy was hated by everyone. He
offended every race, religion, and sexual preference imaginable. He even
said the Lakers suck. So basically we’re looking at everyone from the
Glendale Skinheads to Magic Johnson.</p>
<p><strong>lt. amos</strong>: What are you running from?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Why shucks, Lt. Anus, you told me to get the
fuck out of here…</p>
<p><strong>lt. amos</strong>: If you’re hiding something… oh, oh, I’ll
have so much fun.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Why do you hate me? It’s gotta be more than Me
Private You, You Cop.</p>
<p><strong>lt. amos</strong>: Two words. Disco Express.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Disco Ex – man, that group sucked like a
squid, they had some shitty single they wanted me to plug, back in my
publicist days…</p>
<p><strong>lt. amos</strong>: ‘Booty Time.’</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Yeah, and that lead singer, Jesus, that white
Van McCoy wanna-be with the six-inch platform shoes. He looked…</p>
<p><strong>lt. amos</strong>: Like me.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I was about to say he looked like shit, but
hey, sure, he looked like you.</p>
<p><strong>lt. amos</strong>: ‘It’s booty time, it’s booty time, across
the U.S.A. It’s booty time…’</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: You were the lead sing – Lieutenant, I didn’t
think anyone could cheer me up tonight… Thanks. Really.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Ouch.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Hey, you, get off my cloud. I’m talking to my
friend. 1962 Fender Stratocaster with original humbucking pick-ups,
maple neck, strung upside down for a left- handed motherfucking genius…
Jimi Hendrix.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Who cares? I got a case.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Twelve pack?</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: This ain’t no social call. One hundred
bucks. To find my father.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Did he just say what I think he said?</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: I’ve got a clue. Look at my ring. Before my
old lady ran off to Baja, she told me my dad had this same ring.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Holy Colonel Mustard. Gosh, you didn’t mention
the big clue… Kid, I can’t take your money.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: You need it.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I don’t need it that bad.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I don’t believe it. I took the money.</p>
<p><strong>colleen</strong>: Ford Fairlane, I’m Colleen Sutton and I
need your help. I have a problem and it pertains to the music industry.
What is it they call you? Mr. Rock and…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Don’t say it. Orange juice?</p>
<p><strong>colleen</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Sorry about the glass. And the house. And the
breath.</p>
<p><strong>colleen</strong>: Mr. Fairlane, I’m very rich. The kind of
rich that warps minds. Nothing offends me. When I was eleven, I walked
in on my father and the Shetland pony he had given me for my tenth
birthday. Does that excite you?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I don’t know, I never met your father.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Oh, that! Don’t take it personally. He always
wakes up before I do. Down boy! Roseanne Barr naked!</p>
<p><strong>colleen</strong>: Who’s your decorator?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Some fag. Charged me up the ass.</p>
<p><strong>colleen</strong>: Fag? Ass? I’m sorry, is that a joke?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Poor taste. I know. Listen, I respect
homosexuals. When I was young, my maid was a homosexual. My maid was a
homosexual.</p>
<p><strong>colleen</strong>: I don’t have a sense of humor, either.
Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Now that we’ve broken the ice…</p>
<p><strong>colleen</strong>: I need you to find my little sister. She
goes by the name Zuzu…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Zuzu Petals. You want me to rescue her from
the gorgeous hell that is L.A.</p>
<p><strong>colleen</strong>: But how did you know? Here, take this
picture…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: No thanks. I carry my own.</p>
<p><strong>colleen</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Let’s see, you’re her worried sister.
Yesterday I met her worried father who incidentally was about five years
younger than you. In fact, I capped off the evening by watching him get
electrocuted. They talk about cases like this in the private eye
handbook… something about a ten-foot pole.</p>
<p><strong>colleen</strong>: Five thousand should be enough to assuage
any qualms you have about my family tree.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Yeah, but of course for now, I only get a
twenty.</p>
<p><strong>colleen</strong>: Actually, you may take it all now.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Oh… I have some questions.</p>
<p><strong>colleen</strong>: I have no answers. Thanks for the stain.
Find the girl. In the envelope are tickets to the Dorothy Chandler.
We’ll chat again, then.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Ah, the Dorothy Chandler. I was just there
with my good friend Art Mooney the other night…</p>
<p><strong>colleen</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Nuthin’.</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: K-O-D-S is going to make me rich… Uh, Ford,
aren’t we frisky this morning. It’s only four o’clock. I guess the early
bird gets wormed…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Quiet. Tell me you tapped in the police
computer and found out lots of good stuff about Art Mooney…</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: I found a lot of Art Mooneys. None with a
police record, though. Not even Synchronicity. Have you checked out
Johnny Pinzolo/Crunch’s houseboat yet?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Tonight after I see Don. Some Beverly
Hillbilly just hired me to find you-know-fucking-who. Name’s Colleen
Sutton.</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: Spooky. I’ll process her.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Cool. Jazz, meet me at the Dorothy Chandler
Pavilion tonight. I’ll have a ticket for you at the door. Some concert.
Could be interesting. Dress nice.</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: I haven’t seen her around, and as for who would
want to kill Johnny Crunch, line forms to the left. You’d find less
people on our planet who wanted him alive.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Great pipes.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I’ve heard cars fuck with more harmony.</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: Tell me about it. Name’s Kyle Troy. Can’t we
bring up the bass.</p>
<p><strong>mixer</strong>: It’s up as far as it can go. Any more tricks
and we’re not going to be able to hear his voice at all.</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: Don’t tempt me.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: How could Grendel Records sign such a
wick-prick? I guess Julian Grendel really is deaf as a fucking doorknob.
I hear Ray Charles is going to head up the video division.</p>
<p><strong>grendel</strong>: Actually that’s rather an intriguing
idea…</p>
<p><strong>grendel</strong>: Good to meet you, Mr. Fairlane. Your mouth
makes quite a reflection. I’m Julian Grendel.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Boing. You’re one hell of a lip reader.</p>
<p><strong>grendel</strong>: Why thank you. It’s a Christmas present.
That was my sense of humor, everyone. I wish you would fake a laugh.
It’s easy with a deaf person.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I knew your father. He was quite…</p>
<p><strong>grendel</strong>: An asshole? A swine? A ballistic turd? Pick
one. I never knew what a blessing my accident was until he died and I
had to take over the company. You see the music is irrelevant in this
industry. I’m going to have to ship this ‘wick-prick’ platinum just so
teenage girls can have a compact disc cover to get wet with.</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: Julian’s happy as long as he doesn’t see glass
shatter.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I never thought I’d be jealous of your
handicap… Sorry to hear about Bobby Vomit.</p>
<p><strong>grendel</strong>: Terrible thing, but good career move. His
record sales have gone way up. I’ll just have to create a new Black
Vomit.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I was just discussing this whole Vomit thing
with my friend Art Mooney. Do you know him?</p>
<p><strong>everyone</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: What’s that asshole smiling about? That was
fantastic, man. Let’s just try it one more time. Well, sorry, Ford, I
couldn’t help you. Uh, Ford.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Guys, guys, please.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Yo, what’s the hassle?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: You’re killing rock and raping roll. Keith
Richard’s rolling in his grave and the poor bastard ain’t even dead yet.
<u>You’re</u> <u>tearing me apart</u>! Rock ‘n’ roll is, is…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I got a ’65 Cadillac. Spare time on the
back…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Charge cord to Goldblatts. But I ain’t got
you.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I got women to the right of me… I got women to
the left of me… I got chicks all around me… But I ain’t got you.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I gotta a pocket full of crumpled bills, I
gotta stomach full of different pills, I got Fanny Fox and Wilba Mills,
But I ain’t got you.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: But I ain’t got you…</p>
<p><strong>band</strong>: But I ain’t got you…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: No, I ain’t got you…</p>
<p><strong>band</strong>: No, I ain’t got you…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I said, I ain’t got you…</p>
<p><strong>band</strong>: I said, I ain’t got you…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I ain’t – got – you.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Now, that’s entertainment.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Have a copy of that sent to me, will ya?</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: Right away!</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: You guys part of a band?</p>
<p><strong>punk gunslinger</strong>: … Sure. Our name is Pain.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I wonder which boat’s Johnny’s?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: The love boat is making another run…</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Where’s my Queen Collie? I need some
<u>order</u>!</p>
<p><strong>colleen</strong>: Queen Collie is here.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: This is why I have cable.</p>
<p><strong>smiley</strong>: How’s it going?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: You’re ten seconds away from the most
embarrass –</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Marco…</p>
<p><strong>smiley</strong>: Polo.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Whatever you’re getting paid, I can give you
twenty, maybe thirty bucks more.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Had enough?</p>
<p><strong>smiley</strong>: Feel my thumb? I keep it there forty seconds
more and a welt develops cutting off the oxygen to your brain. I leave.
Twenty- one minutes later, you’re dead. The slowest, most painful
minutes a person can experience.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I guess you never saw ‘A Very Brady
Christmas.’</p>
<p><strong>smiley</strong>: Case closed, okay? Thirty seconds.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Fine!</p>
<p><strong>smiley</strong>: What’s fine?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I’m off it!</p>
<p><strong>smiley</strong>: Off what? Twenty seconds…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: The case!</p>
<p><strong>smiley</strong>: Oh. One more thing. This is personal. I want
you to tell me you’re a big sissy.</p>
<p><strong>colleen</strong>: My God, Mr. Fairlane, you look like the
Fall of Saigon.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Colleen and Johnny, sitting in a tree,
k-i-s-s-i-n-g…</p>
<p><strong>colleen</strong>: Uh, let’s go sit down.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Excuse me…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Hey, Jazz, I told you to dress ‘nice’ not
<u>nice</u>. What, did you think this was a date?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Sorry, Jazz. After this, I’ll throw a burger
down your throat, okay?</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: You’re a fucking gentleman. What do you want
from me?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: This Colleen Sutton woman I’m with. If she
flees me to go powder her whatever, I need you to keep tabs…</p>
<p><strong>colleen</strong>: Ford, they’re starting.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: You going to be okay?</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: Go on, ‘they’re stahting.’</p>
<p><strong>colleen</strong>: So you know about Johnny Crunch and
myself.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I’m sorry, that’s gotta be a pair of tube
socks he has down there.</p>
<p><strong>ballet patron</strong>: Shh.</p>
<p><strong>colleen</strong>: You want off the case, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Ouch… Of course I want off the case. Some
monster from Woodstock tried and succeeded in killing me tonight. The
fact I’m alive’s a technicality.</p>
<p><strong>colleen</strong>: So you…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Listen, Queen Collie, I have a code. I never,
ever, drop a case. Besides, I, uh, used all your money to pay my bills,
so I kinda owe you.</p>
<p><strong>colleen</strong>: Nonsense. After what you’ve been through,
it sounds like I owe you.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: They did one of these about my ex- wife. It’s
called ‘The Nutcracker.’ ‘The Nut-crack-er’… I don’t need money. I need
some questions answered.</p>
<p><strong>colleen</strong>: I’ll do my best.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Question one: Can I have some money? Kidding.
Why didn’t you tell me about you and Johnny? You two were into something
even more dangerous than sex, weren’t you? Who? What? Where? How?
Now.</p>
<p><strong>colleen</strong>: Jonathan was such a beautiful man. No one
knew him like I did… Excuse me. I can’t do this now. I’ll call you
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Thanks for the information. Appreciate it.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: That guy gets an erection, he gives himself a
black eye. I mean, you can see him coming around a corner and still have
time to comb your hair.</p>
<p><strong>ballet patron</strong>: Will you please be <u>quiet</u>.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: He’ll be telling that joke tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>snooty non-smoker</strong>: Can you read… ‘smoker’?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Can you whistle ‘Man in the Mirror’ out your
ass… ‘snapperhead’?</p>
<p><strong>snooty non-smoker</strong>: Hey, don’t be a pottymouth. I
just don’t want cancer.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: You know, you’re right, sir, and I’m sorry. I
thought I lived in a country where you were free to do any stupid thing
you wanted; drive to work naked, make love to a V.C.R., but hey, you
reminded me I live in a hell where any sperm like you can stab me in the
heart with these things called opinions, just because you have them.</p>
<p><strong>snooty non-smoker</strong>: It’s okay. It’s okay, guy. Smoke
all you want. Here, have one of mine…</p>
<p><strong>grendel</strong>: Well, hello, Ford.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Mmmmmmm. Mmmm, mmm.</p>
<p><strong>grendel</strong>: I must say you’re an island of reality in
an ocean of diarrhea.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: And it’s good to see you, Julian. This is my
assistant, Jazz.</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: Mmmmmmm. Mmmm, mmm.</p>
<p><strong>grendel</strong>: So what did you think of the ballet? Was it
like a warm Ice Capades?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Yeah, I did, you condescending fuck, but I
miss Snoopy coming out at the end. Isn’t your enjoyment impaired?</p>
<p><strong>grendel</strong>: Don’t worry I can run every ballet note for
note in my brain…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: What, were you one of those brilliant child
prahdigies who was writing baroque operas while the other kids were
fingerpainting Mr. Greenjeans…</p>
<p><strong>grendel</strong>: Something like that… Let’s talk business. I
think someone is trying to rip my company off. I’ve tried the <u>Yellow
Pages</u>, now I think it’s your turn…</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: If you’ll excuse us.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Jazz, we’re talking here.</p>
<p><strong>grendel</strong>: Go on, another time, another place.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Why did you interrupt? Maxwell seemed like he
wanted to hire me.</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: Shut up, goodies from the ice queen.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: How’d you get this from her?</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: You don’t want to know, believe me. But don’t
worry, I washed my hands…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: A fucking C.D. Wow, this case is closed. So,
she’s got bad taste in music and in men… Did I tell you she and Johnny
were lovers and that they were into something and he got killed for
it?</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: No, as a matter of fact you didn’t. What about
the girl, Zuzu Petals, how does she fit in? I mean, she is what this
case is about.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I wish I knew. You did good work…</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: Make eye contact when you say that.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I’m sorry, that dress. What do you say we…</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: Celebrate? Like we celebrated after solving
the White Bluesman murders? Forget it, man.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Oh… Hey, how about that hors d’oeuvre,
tonight?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Why didn’t I pick fishermen?</p>
<p><strong>kurt loder</strong>: Police are now saying Bobby Vomit was
not the victim of an overdose as first suspected, but was actually
poisoned. Police have no suspects yet and have asked all Black Vomit
fans <u>not</u> to show up at the funeral which, by the way, will be
held at the Hollywood Cemetery at midnight. In homage, here’s the last
video of Bobby Vomit.</p>
<p><strong>sleazy guy</strong>: That’s one hundred. Each.</p>
<p><strong>sleazy guy</strong>: Got those Vomit invites here…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Scalping to a funeral, you’re a pretty sleazy
guy.</p>
<p><strong>sleazy guy</strong>: Thanks. You interested. It’s festival
seating, so…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>sleazy guy</strong>: Three hundred.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: You gave it to the girls for one.</p>
<p><strong>sleazy guy</strong>: Hey, they blew me.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Oh. Three hundred coming right up.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Geez, am I the only one who paid full price
here?</p>
<p><strong>girl in veil</strong>: He was so good…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Yeah, he was one of the greats. Hey, you
haven’t seen this girl, have you?</p>
<p><strong>girl in veil</strong>: Is this a trick question?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Zuzu Petals! Zuzu Petals! Yes! Who killed
Bobby Vomit? Who killed Johnny Crunch? Why do people want you so goddamn
bad?</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: I don’t know. I’m so scared. Help me.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: A simple ‘please’ would suffice…</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: Fluck you!</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Fluck me?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: K-O-D-S is going to make me rich!</p>
<p><strong>smiley</strong>: How’s it going? Radio station contest. Ford,
I mean really…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: If you hurt her, I’ll kill you! Maybe not
personally, but I’ll think of something…</p>
<p><strong>mortician one</strong>: Some days it’s great to be alive.</p>
<p><strong>mortician two</strong>: Hey, he took Lydia!</p>
<p><strong>mortician one</strong>: So what, we’ve had our fun.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Now it’s getting interesting, Smileyhead.</p>
<p><strong>smiley</strong>: Normally, I’d be up for a bullshit car
chase, but I got to get up early tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>smiley</strong>: Ford, where did you go? Don’t be such a
baby…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: You were saying, snapperhead? I’ll bet you’re
not smiling now!</p>
<p><strong>smiley</strong>: Oh, but I am. Dianetics, Ford. You should
try it.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Say cheese…</p>
<p><strong>smiley</strong>: Thanks, but I have my own.</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: My hero…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Fuck you, man! I can’t talk… Mom! What are you
calling for? No, no, I don’t always answer the phone like that. It’s
business!</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Have I met any nice girls? Ma, Ma, get some
sleep. I gotta another call… Sorry, it was my mom…</p>
<p><strong>smiley</strong>: Your mom is special. I look forward to
raping her at your funeral.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: You are one sick…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Damn baby, I hope you filled out some organ
donor cards…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Zuzu Petals, I’m Ford Fairlane! I’m the good
guy, he’s the bad guy!</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: This is so amazing! A car chase! Let’s get on
some car chase music! Ra-a-w-wk!</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: It’s red, Ford.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Give me your gum and grab the wheel.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: Peachy.</p>
<p><strong>voluptuous woman</strong>: Boy, you morticians really know
how to party…</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: Nyah, nyah, nyah-nyah, nyah.</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: That was one of the ten most provocative
experiences of my life!</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Let’s get serious…</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: Why are all these people after me?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Uh… wha? You’re supposed to answer those
questions, not ask ’em. I take it a woman named Colleen Sutton is not
your big sister and that the late D.J. Johnny Crunch ain’t your
daddy?</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: I’m so sure! I’m an only child and my parents
are Bill and Shirley Petals of South Bend, Indiana. They run a hardware
store and…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: You hung out with Bobby Vomit. Who would want
him dead?</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: I dunno. He was to sound what Cezanne was to
image or at least I thought so. Ever since he died, I’ve been chased…
<u>Omigod</u>!</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: What? Jesus, tell me!</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: It’s Spunk Lewis, the lead singer for Dead
Ribbit! Mr. Bus Driver, stop!</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: Spunk, come back…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: How is it you can look at that HairHead and
see God, when all I see is a lucky asshole from Reseda.</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: Because I know rock-n-roll.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: You know rock-n-roll? Darlin’, I’ve been in
the music industry for as long as you’ve lived. I’ve seen things you
can’t even have nightmares about… but then I guess I’m just not equipped
to know the industry the way you do…</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: Come again? B.FL.D., I have sex with rock
stars; it’s not like I’m doing something that I don’t enjoy with them,
like shuffleboard. Don’t worry about me, I practice safe sex and next
summer, I’m going to U.C.L.A.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Zuzu Petals, you’re not bad. In fact, I was
discussing this whole rock-n-roll thing with my pal Art Mooney the other
day. You know him?</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: No. Who’s Art Mooney?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: He’s the lamest clue I’ve ever had in my life.
Here’s our stop…</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: Why don’t I despise you?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: What did you… Hey, where’s your spex?</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: Contacts.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I like.</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: He saved my life! Isn’t he the coolest man in
the world?</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: Says a lot about the world… Zuzu Petals… Case
closed?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I don’t know, what was the case?</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: Ms. Sutton hired you to find the girl.
Period.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Then I guess her case is closed. Mine isn’t. I
want to know why everybody wants Zuzu. Why people are killing and dying
for her.</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: Yeah, it’s weird. Bobby and Johnny were such
good friends…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Friends? You didn’t tell me that.</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: You didn’t ask. Have you ever thought about
mousse?</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: K-O-D-S is going to make me rich… Uh…</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: She’s just a bundle of energy, a real
treasure…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Yeah, let’s bury her.</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: Hello… It’s Colleen. With answers. She wants
to meet. Down. Way down-town. Late.</p>
<p><strong>colleen</strong>: I ask you to find a girl and instead you
steal a C.D. from me. Ford. You suck.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I’ll buy you a new one. I found her.</p>
<p><strong>colleen</strong>: Zuzu Petals! Did she have it?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Have what?</p>
<p><strong>colleen</strong>: Did she tell you anything?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Lots of things. Her favorite yogurt. The ten
drummers she would take to a desert island…</p>
<p><strong>colleen</strong>: Drink your cappucino, you’re giving me a
headache…</p>
<p><strong>colleen</strong>: If feels like it’s going to explode.</p>
<p><strong>colleen</strong>: Damnit… you were right last night. Jonathan
and I were into more than sex. Along with Bobby Vomit, right after old
Jack Grendel died, we took part in a scheme to rip off Grendel records…
I didn’t want you involved…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: But I am…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: What cheap shit… hey, waiter!</p>
<p><strong>colleen</strong>: We invested in these factories. In
Vancouver.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Hold that thought. Are we being shot at?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I finally got you to laugh.</p>
<p><strong>colleen</strong>: That was close…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: What did these Vancouver factories do?</p>
<p><strong>colleen</strong>: I haven’t told you the important part!</p>
<p><strong>colleen</strong>: Art Mo-o-o-ney!</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Thanks, I needed that.</p>
<p><strong>smiley</strong>: You assholes owe me a Big Gulp.</p>
<p><strong>lt. amos</strong>: Have a problem, call Ford Fairlane. He
won’t solve your case, but who cares, you’ll be dead in a couple days
anyway. Let’s face it. After today, the California Raisins aren’t gonna
hire you.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: That’s okay. I’m quitting the music detective
business to become a cop killer. Pay’s the same, but it’ll be much more
fun.</p>
<p><strong>lt. amos</strong>: God, I wish I could prove you killed
everybody. Unfortunately, I know who the real killer is.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>lt. amos</strong>: It’s some psycho killer groupie. I got an
anonymous letter that says she killed Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and
now, this society dame.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Once I got an anonymous letter saying that the
world would be destroyed by a giant purple raindrop. I didn’t even buy a
fucking umbrella… You were in too many discos during the seventies. The
Village People rotted your brain.</p>
<p><strong>lt. amos</strong>: That’s the difference between a great
investigator like me and a piece of Spam like you. You look at this
picture and all you see is beauty. I see the beast.</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: Yeah, on a car phone! No, he’s not a
guitarist… he’s better… He’s a rock-n-roll detec –</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Lieutenant Anus has discovered the
cold-blooded killer behind everything.</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: Ah, an obvious choice.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Let’s get her out of here, before she starts a
shoot-out. Drop us at my place.</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: Why are you depressed? You get in all the
clubs, you never pay cover…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Stop. We still got serious detective stuff to
do, but we’ve been up all night so we should hit the sack for…</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: What a perv…</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: Let’s watch some ‘M.T.V.’</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: People still watch that?</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: Who cares about people?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Zuzu!</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Zuzu, wake up…</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: Hah fluck, great video, huh?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: Okay? I just blew up. I feel orgasmic.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Puh-leeze…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: My axe!</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: Ford, do you got something cooking in the
microwave?</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: Wait, my purse!</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Wait, my purse?</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: Maybe it was just a pot pie.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: I tried to stop them, man.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: I’m sorry…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Shut up, you dummy. Who did this to you?</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: These two guys in long cowboy coats and
real nice suits. I think Armani. They were going through your stuff with
screwdrivers and shit… I did what you would have done.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Run to the nearest phone and call the
police.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Fuck that, I mean, the heck with that. I
kicked their ass! Well, I tried. There were two of them you know…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Jesus, how could you be so stupid? Come on,
we’re going to a hospital.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: I tried to help you…!</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: And hey, I appreciate it…</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Where’s my father? Have you even
looked?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Yeah, uh, I got some pretty good leads…</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Liar! You don’t care! About anything.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Well, at least the guys at the garage brought
my baby back.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Why the music industry? Ford Fairlane,
detective of the fishermen.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Ah! Mo-ther-fu –</p>
<p><strong>melodi</strong>: Hi, private eye guy!</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Hey, the poet…</p>
<p><strong>melodi</strong>: Oh wow, hiding out from cold blooded
killers. The sisters are going to die…</p>
<p><strong>melodi</strong>: Hey, troops, here’s that rock ‘n’ roll
detective I told you about.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Hebedeebuh. Hebedeebuh. Maybe I did die in the
explosion.</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: I know the feeling. This must be hell. Can you
believe, a flucking sorority… I’m gonna vomit Day-Glo.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Ye-ah. Sure.</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: Don’t forget, Jazz, bonewad.</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: Hello, Ford…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: What are you doing at the office? You wouldn’t
believe what I’ve gone through tonight… I’m calling from the Mega Beta
Pogo Sorority.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Mmmh! My house was blown up, my car was blown
up, and my koala bear isn’t in too great a shape, either. ‘That’s too
bad.’ All you can say is ‘That’s too bad.’</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: Yes, Ford, that’s all I can say.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: So, then Springsteen says to Madonna, ‘Hey, I
only eat lime Jell-O…’</p>
<p><strong>sorority sister one</strong>: Does Van Halen sleep in the
nude?</p>
<p><strong>sorority sister two</strong>: Does Debbie Gibson sleep with
Van Halen?</p>
<p><strong>sorority sister three</strong>: Is Sting really an
asshole?</p>
<p><strong>weird sorority sister</strong>: If Axl Rose was reincarnated
as a black woman would he be Jodie Whatley or Aretha…</p>
<p><strong>melodi</strong>: Sisters, sisters, give Ford a break. What do
you say we induct him as an honorary member…</p>
<p><strong>sisters</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>heavy metal gunslinger</strong>: I got an address for the
sorority.</p>
<p><strong>punk gunslinger</strong>: It’s a tough business…</p>
<p><strong>heavy metal gunslinger</strong>: If you ever have a son, I
hope his dog dies…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Everybody, blow!</p>
<p><strong>unpoor frat boy driver</strong>: Du-udes, they executed my
Midget!</p>
<p><strong>punk gunslinger</strong>: It’s cut-our-losses time, dude.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: All work and no play makes Ford a dull
boy.</p>
<p><strong>sorority sister one</strong>: Water balloon fight!</p>
<p><strong>melodi</strong>: Sisters, don’t get your robes wet.</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: Why do we have to have an office on the second
floor?</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: I came to warn you…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Oh, Jazz, those bastards… call an ambulance!
Get that music off!</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: Sure, I have a much more appropriate C.D.
Bobby sneaked it into my purse the day he died. It was so romantic…</p>
<p><strong>melodi</strong>: This isn’t music!</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: It is to us! It’s computerised.</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: I believe the last time we came across one of
these, was at the ballet. What were your words… ‘A fucking C.D. This
case is closed.’</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I’ve always said the one reason I’m the best
detective in the industry is that I’m the only one… but hey, I never
throw away a clue…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Sisters, the sorority computer…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Aha, just what I suspected!</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: You’re not funny.</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: This is boring, guys.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Zuzu, be quiet. Put in Colleen’s disc. Number
two.</p>
<p><strong>all girls</strong>: Bor-ring.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: Hmmm, the first disc was putting out an
incomprehensible stream of high bits. This one is putting out low bits.
The data is in some fucked binary system. The two discs need to
interface simultaneously with a third decryptor disc. Comprendo?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Su-ure. Two people hired me to find Zuzu in
order to get hold of one of those discs and Colleen threw a tizz when we
took hers. Obviously, all this binary disc shit is pretty mighty. But
it’s not necessary. People are dead. One was a friend. The same people
were involved in a scam to rip off Grendel Records. Bottom line’s Julian
Grendel is doing a little revenge number…</p>
<p><strong>sorority sister #1</strong>: You’re making quite a jump…</p>
<p><strong>sorority sister #2</strong>: Do you have any proof?</p>
<p><strong>sorority sister #3</strong>: You can’t just go up to Julian
Grendel and say…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Jazz, get to a hospital. Zuzu and I are going
to feel things out with Mr. Grendel. If I don’t call in an hour… hell, I
don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Uh, nice piano. Probably get a lot of
complaints from the neighbors – heh… It’s another time, Julian, another
place. If I told you Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and Colleen Sutton were
the ones you were complaining about, the ones who tried to rip you off,
what would your reaction be?</p>
<p><strong>grendel</strong>: Shock.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: And if I told you that you already knew all
that shit, and that you had them killed, what would you do then?</p>
<p><strong>grendel</strong>: Golly, I’d probably faint.</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: Uh-oh.</p>
<p><strong>smiley</strong>: Bro, they still can’t get that spot out.</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: Ford, you were right!</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Ye-ah.</p>
<p><strong>grendel</strong>: Actually you’re a bit off in the motivation
department… I mean, revenge is so… Bronson. Wait, where’s the third
C.D.? How could you come here without proof? It’s a three piece set
here! A computer disc from Colleen, Bobby’s computer disc, and Johnny’s
computer disc. Together they make, oh fucking forget it!</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Yeah, yeah, I know the third one unscrambles
the high bits and the low bits. Shit, just start torturing me, man. I
didn’t even know Johnny had a disc and I can’t deal with any ‘Don’t play
games with me, Mr. Fairlane’ bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>grendel</strong>: Don’t play games… ugh. Did you say you
don’t have the third… ugh. I’m not going to torture <u>you</u>,
Ford.</p>
<p><strong>grendel</strong>: Not her, Ford. I’m afraid sometimes a pussy
is just a pussy, but a 1962 Fender Stratocaster with an original
Humbucking Pick-ups, maple neck, strung upside down for a left-handed
genius – Jimi Hendrix, is something else entirely.</p>
<p><strong>punk gunslinger</strong>: Hey, that’s the sound your koala
bear made when we hung it.</p>
<p><strong>grendel</strong>: It doesn’t have to be like this?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Oh God, please, <u>don’t</u>!</p>
<p><strong>grendel</strong>: Don’t you think this guitar would look a
lot neater with Ford’s name on it?</p>
<p><strong>gunslingers</strong>: Ooooooh, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>grendel</strong>: It’s 7:30. You really should get a
watch.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Ah, I didn’t say seven <u>P</u>.M., now did
I?</p>
<p><strong>grendel</strong>: Ford. Ford. Ford. It’s too bad it had to
end like this. We could have been friends. We’re so much alike. We both
know ‘Rock-N-Roll’ is all bullshit. That life is a disease and
everyone’s a victim. Hell, we even smoke the same brand of
cigarettes.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I just gave up smoking. A last drink?</p>
<p><strong>grendel</strong>: I’m running a little late. You see, I’m
having a party at <u>THE</u> Club to introduce the new lead singer for
Black Vomit. Everyone in the industry will be there, including our
friend, Don Cleveland.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: What about Don?</p>
<p><strong>grendel</strong>: Before Black Vomit starts its set, Don will
have his head blown off. The papers next week will reveal that he was
partners with Bobby, Johnny, and Collie in ‘the Grendel Records scam.’
He killed them to pay off a debt to ‘the mob’ or something lame like
that. And then the mob iced him. It’s all more tasteful than it
sounds.</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: I can’t believe you guys hung a koala
bear…</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: That is. So. Graphic. I mean I’m still in
shock here. You know I had a dream about a priest hanging a koala bear
during my first communion…</p>
<p><strong>grendel</strong>: Is she saying what I think she’s…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I’m afraid so, you want her?</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: But you know, that was just a dream. Doesn’t
really count.</p>
<p><strong>ford &amp; grendel</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Julian, you’re evil incarnate. And you know,
while I’m a little angry that you’re going to kill me and all, I gotta
salute your toughness. Life threw you lemons, and gall darnit, you made
lemonade. Julian Grendel, guys like you don’t grow on trees. Here’s to
you… sucking my dick.</p>
<p><strong>smiley</strong>: Take a free hit, bro. Come on…</p>
<p><strong>grendel</strong>: Sure…</p>
<p><strong>grendel</strong>: Kill them. Not quickly.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: If you ask me that question one more…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: When I say ‘no,’ run for the door.</p>
<p><strong>grendel</strong>: Oh, wait. One sec. Open the window.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>grendel</strong>: Ciao.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Don’t hurt me?</p>
<p><strong>heavy metal gunslinger</strong>: Now we’re talking…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Now!</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Move it!</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: Nice left you got there, jerk.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Sorry, it was dark, now come on.</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: This way…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: No, wait…</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: Suck a dick, I left my purse…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: As Clark Gable said to Ava Gardner in Mogambo:
‘Fuck the purse, we’re gonna die-e-e.’</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: Reality-reality-reality – Outrageous building,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Ye-ah.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: And you say I never take you anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>smiley</strong>: Let’s rock.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Pretty smooth, huh?</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: Smooth. I know this is dangerous and
everything but it’s kind of fun. Ever see “Batman,” you know when Batman
and Robin are climbing up the side of the building and somebody sticks
their head outside the window and says… I forget what they said but it’s
pretty funny.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Why have you come to my planet?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Around!</p>
<p><strong>ford/zuzu</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p><strong>heavy metal gunslinger</strong>: He-lp.</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: Oops.</p>
<p><strong>tour guide</strong>: The building is a symbol for the music
industry, a business where anything can happen and usually…</p>
<p><strong>tour guide</strong>: … does.</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: Ick.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I won’t ask why you would want to help someone
trying to kill you, but hey, good job. Shall we?</p>
<p><strong>smiley</strong>: How’s it going?</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: Oh, <u>Fo-ord</u>!</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: Fluck this.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I want you to say that you’re the biggest
sissy in the whole wide world.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Okay. ’B-y-e!</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Hey. God. You’re an asshole.</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: Let go of the belt! What are you doing? You
got mad at me for trying to save the other guy.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I can’t kill this kid’s father…</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: Who do you think you are, Ford? The tooth
fairy. Kill! Kill! Kill!</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: This is fucking unbelievable. Zuzu, it’s a
long story, you see…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: ‘Excuse me, while I kiss the sky.’ Whoooo! Oh,
God, buddy, I’m sorry for calling you an asshole. You’re number one,
man! Hey, Zuzu, look I found my guitar.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Sorry, Jimi.</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: Thanks. I know how much that thang meant to
you.</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: Hello, Mr. Tongue! What a perv.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: You wish. Come on, let’s get outta here.</p>
<p><strong>amiable male tourist</strong>: Excuse me, could you give us
directions to the Mann Chinese Theatre?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Go back to Michigan, asswipe.</p>
<p><strong>amiable male tourist</strong>: But we’re from Wisconsin…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: What’s the fucking difference?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: There’s that question…</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: How’d it go?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Your timing swallows the massive one. Grendel
just tried to kill us, he’s about to frame and kiss Don, and we can’t do
shit. Don’t even ask about those discs. Goddamn that Art Mooney with a
star by his name! It’s tied to Johnny’s C.D., I know.</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: Johnny’s C.D.?</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: Maybe Art Mooney’s the name of like a
constellation…</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: And maybe the stars correlate with a map in
the Thomas Guide… sounds pretty decaf, doesn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Ladies, life’s not that complicated.</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: Oh how sweet, your friend’s got his own
star.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: ArtArtArtArtMooneyMooneyMooney Mooney.</p>
<p><strong>jaime</strong>: This is the best party ever thrown here…</p>
<p><strong>grendel</strong>: It’s going to be a night to remember…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: What an interface!</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: Seems to be information about a factory in
Vancouver.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Yeah, Colleen mentioned it. What do they
make?</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: C.D.s. The music kind. From the Grendel
label.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Without Grendel knowing about it. B-I-N-G-O
and Bingo was his name-O. Counterfeit C.D.s. Tape piracy has graduated
to disc piracy, the sound quality’s better, and so’s the money.</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: But the funny thing is, take a look at these
Swiss bank account numbers. We got Bobby, Johnny, Colleen… and Julian
Grendel.</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: I wish you could hear the buzz this party is
making…</p>
<p><strong>grendel</strong>: I can feel it, man… Can I talk to you in
private…</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: Grendel was in charge of the ripping off of
the company.</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: It started after Old Jack Grendel died, the
others were just investors.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: After their initial investment in the factory,
Grendel didn’t need them. Told them to fuck off. They tried to get these
C.D.s together in order to have proof of Grendel’s involvement, so they
could keep him in line. Now’s the fun part…</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: I can’t believe I lost an eye for a bunch of
phony C.D.s</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: Oh God, the door’s locked. We’re going to have
to crawl down!</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: Psyche.</p>
<p><strong>grendel</strong>: What can I say, Don, it’s business. Dump
the body in, let’s say, Chinatown.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Hey, Don, how’s the high blood pressure.</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: Could somebody tell me what’s going on? <u>Like
slo-owly</u>…</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: You-see-it-all-starts-with-this-
factory-in-Vancouver-and there’s these-C.D.s…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I’ll mail you a letter, come on!</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: Let’s see, you threw me through a plate glass
window and I hit you with my Volkswagen. I think we’re in for a fair
fight.</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: Maybe not…</p>
<p><strong>grendel</strong>: They make jokes about the music industry.
They say it’s cutthroat, they say it’s cynical, well we know the truth!
There’s a lot of love in this room tonight, but, but…</p>
<p><strong>grendel</strong>: But I’ve talked long enough. Now, the
moment you’ve been waiting for. I’d like you to meet the new singer for
Black Vomit… Kyle Troy!</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Read. My. Lips. You’re. Going. Down.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I used to be just like you, abusing women to
hide my emotional insecurities. I realize now that a little insecurity
is good for a man.</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: Sam the Sleazebag to the rescue!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You’re ten seconds away from the most
embarrassing moment of your life.</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: Please say you won’t move! I don’t want to
shoot you, actually I wouldn’t mind, but please, say you won’t move.</p>
<p><strong>punk gunslinger</strong>: Die, whore!</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: I guess that’s a no…</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: Come on, Sam, vodka milkshakes are on me.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: You’d said something about proof…</p>
<p><strong>grendel</strong>: Oh please, Ford, I’ll do any –</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: And may I suggest for dessert, the five copies
I made…</p>
<p><strong>grendel</strong>: Fuck me…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Maybe later, but first I want like to know why
you’d steal from your own company…</p>
<p><strong>grendel</strong>: When I was young, I read <u>Billboard</u>
and I could not believe how much Grendel Records and how little of it my
idiot father Old Jack Grendel got.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Yeah, it’s pretty amazing how much cash you
gotta give to the actual artists who create the music. Those ingrates
really take a bite. But seriously, when Pops died, you got Vomit,
Crunch, and Sutton to help finance a C.D. Cleans operation. You got
greedy and they tried to get the three discs together to threaten you,
but…</p>
<p><strong>grendel</strong>: What is this, are you holding a microphone
behind my head?</p>
<p><strong>grendel</strong>: I should kill more music people! When I was
sixteen, I wrote an opera, the greatest piece of music ever created in
the 20th Century outside the <u>Dirty Dancing</u> soundtrack. It was
called ‘Paco the Shoeshine Boy.’ When I showed it to my father, he said
it ‘wasn’t happening.’ That ‘no playlists worth his while would touch
it’!</p>
<p><strong>grendel</strong>: Let’s face it, making money is the only art
form open to innovation. Whoever says they’re in the business because
they like music is a lying pathetic piece of shit or total idiot like
Kyle Troy…</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: Is this guy flucked up or what? I think he’s
going to blow!</p>
<p><strong>grendel</strong>: The day my father turned down ‘Paco’ I
dedicated my life to taking over this fucking industry and making it so
disgusting, so sleazy, and so corrupt that it would have to
self-destruct! I even pissed in the punchbowl tonight…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Man, Julian, that accident took away more than
your hearing.</p>
<p><strong>grendel</strong>: Accident? Accident! You naive pussball,
when I realized my life of music could only be a life of music industry.
I <u>cut my fucking</u> <u>ears off</u> so I’d only hear <u>my</u>
music. Here, look.</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: Hoh graphic! I’m going to dream of ears for a
year! Ugh!</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Just be thankful he wasn’t dissatisfied with
his sex life.</p>
<p><strong>grendel</strong>: You little bitch…</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: ‘Feelings, whoa oh, feelings…’</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Jazz!</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: Ford!</p>
<p><strong>grendel</strong>: I’m still the king!</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Julian, you’re fired.</p>
<p><strong>jaime</strong>: Is this for real, Larry?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: No way, Jaime. He’s wearing this gooey stuff
on his body that the flames can’t affect. Bobby Vomit opened his act
this way.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Now that… I have no idea…</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: Thanks for the promotion, man.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: No prob…</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: Look who I found. It’s Damion Flemm! He’s
taking me on tour to Japan!</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: So, Zuzu. Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: Yeah, Ford. I’m okay.</p>
<p><strong>lt. amos</strong>: You do realize that tonight is disco
appreciation night at the Coconut Teazer…</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: I’m sorry, sir, but we got a report that
Fairlane and the psycho- killer-groupie are here.</p>
<p><strong>lt. amos</strong>: There they are! Hey!</p>
<p><strong>lt. amos</strong>: I should’ve known you two were in this
together…</p>
<p><strong>lt. amos</strong>: Sorry, sexual favors won’t help…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Happy listening…</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’ve learned my lesson, Ford. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>ovary two</strong>: Isn’t he the best? Why don’t you come out
with us?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Can’t. Have you seen my assistant, Jazz?</p>
<p><strong>ovary one</strong>: She took off. Said something about you
being a real asshole.</p>
<p><strong>smiley</strong>: How’s it going?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: You gotta be kidding! This is
unfuckingbelievable! I have to start the evening crawling down Capital
Records, I shoulda chose suicide then, but oh no, the night was young!
Next up, my guitar! The second most important thing I own and now it’s
toothpicks for the homeless on Hollywood Boulevard! Then, then, after I
burned up your brother, Jazz… I should say as a fucking footnote I’ve
usually treated women like shit – used corsages, the wet spot, you know
giving out Domino’s Pizza’s phone number and saying it’s mine… Tonight
was different. I felt respect. I felt love. Then Jazz left me… and
<u>now</u> I get to die!</p>
<p><strong>smiley</strong>: The point?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Let me go out like a man.</p>
<p><strong>smiley</strong>: Anyway you want it, asshole.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Thanks for working. Thanks for being a hu-uge
bonehead. ‘Let me go out like a man’ – Ha!</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: So, did you find my dad?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Well, I got some good news and some bad
news.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Yeah, go on…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Good news is that yeah, I found him. The bad
