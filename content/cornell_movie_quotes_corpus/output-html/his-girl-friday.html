<p><strong>1st operator</strong>: This is the Morning Post… The City
Room? Just a moment, I’ll connect you.</p>
<p><strong>2nd operator</strong>: Morning Post… Sports Department? Just
a moment –</p>
<p><strong>office boy</strong>: What’s a seven-letter word for –?</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Don’t ask me! If I knew any seven- letter
words, I’d be something better than a reporter!</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Hey! Down! Down!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Hello, Skinny. Remember me?</p>
<p><strong>office boy</strong>: Hildy Johnson!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Hello, Maisie.</p>
<p><strong>maisie</strong>: Hello – Hildy! You coming back?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: No, just visiting. Tell me, is the lord of
the universe in today?</p>
<p><strong>maisie</strong>: He is – and in a very bad humor. I think
somebody stole one of his crown jewels. Shall I announce you?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: No, never mind – I’ll blow my own
trumpet.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: I won’t be more than ten minutes, I promise
you.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Even ten minutes is a long time to be away
from you.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: What did you say, Bruce?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I said – uh – I said even ten minutes – is a
long time – to be away from you.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Don’t be embarrassed, Bruce. I heard it, but
I just wanted to hear it again. I can stand being spoiled a little. The
gentleman I’m going to have a chat with did very little spoiling.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I’d like to spoil him just once. Sure you
don’t want me to go in with you?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: My job, Bruce. I started it – and I’ll finish
it.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I suppose you’re right – but if it gets
rough, remember I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: I’ll come a-running, pardner.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Thanks, Bruce.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Hello, Beatrice. How’s “Advice to the
Lovelorn”?</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: Hildy! I’ll be a monkey’s uncle! What are
you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Point of information – what does a girl say
on meeting her divorced husband? OR:</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: My advice is duck and cross with your
right.</p>
<p><strong>louie</strong>: A little more round the chin, Boss.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Why, I’m surprised, Mr. Burns. That’s no way
to talk to your wife – even if she’s no longer your wife.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Hello, Hildy!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Hello, Walter. Hi, Louie – how’s the
slotmachine king?</p>
<p><strong>louie</strong>: Oh, I ain’t doing that any more. I’m retired.
I’m one of you fellas now – a newspaper man.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Editorials?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Get going, Louie. I got company.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: Walter!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: I’m busy, Duffy.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: Well, you’re not too busy to know that the
Governor hasn’t signed that reprieve!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: And that means Earl Williams dies tomorrow
morning and makes a sucker out of us!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: You’re crazy. Where’s Mac?</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: He’s on my phone. He just called me.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: They can’t do that to me!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Give me that call on Duffy’s wire! Hello –
Mac? Burns. Where’s the Governor? – What do you mean, you can’t locate
him? Mac, you know what this means. We’re the only paper in town
defending Earl Williams and if he hangs tomorrow we’re washed up! Find
the Governor and when you find him tell him we want that reprieve!… Tell
him I elected him and I can have him impeached! Sure, you can do it, Mac
– I know you can. I always said you were the greatest reporter in the
country and now you can prove it. Get going! Attaboy!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: The greatest reporter in the country! First I
gotta tell him what news to get! Gotta tell him how to get it – then I
gotta write it for him afterward! Now if you were a decent City Editor
–</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: Don’t blame me. I’m City Editor in name only.
You do all the hiring around here.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Yeah! Well, I do the firing, too. Remember
that, Duffy, and Keep a civil tongue in your head.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: I don’t like to interfere with business, but
would you boys pardon us while we have a little heart-to- heart
talk?</p>
<p><strong>duffy and louie</strong>: Well – But I gotta –</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Scram, you guys.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: You won’t miss anything. You’ll probably be
able to hear him just as well outside as here.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Mind if I sit down?</p>
<p><strong>burns’ voice</strong>: I said scram!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: May I have a cigarette, please?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Thanks. A match?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: How long is it?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: How long is what?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: You know what. How long since we’ve seen each
other?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Let’s see. I was in Reno six weeks – then
Bermuda… Oh, about four months, I guess. Seems like yesterday to me.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Maybe it was yesterday. Been seeing me in
your dreams?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: No – Mama doesn’t dream about you any more,
Walter. You wouldn’t know the old girl now.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Oh, yes I would. I’d know you any time –</p>
<p><strong>burns and hildy</strong>: – any place, anywhere –</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: You’re repeating yourself! That’s the speech
you made the night you proposed. “– any time – any place –
anywhere!”</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: I notice you still remember it.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: I’ll always remember it. If I hadn’t
remembered it, I wouldn’t have divorced you.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: You know, Hildy, I sort of wish you hadn’t
done it.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Done what?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Divorced me. It sort of makes a fellow lose
faith in himself. It almost gives him a feeling he wasn’t wanted.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Holy mackerel! Look, Walter, that’s what
divorces are for.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Nonsense. You’ve got the old-fashioned idea
that divorces are something that last forever – till ‘death us do part’.
Why, a divorce doesn’t mean anything today. It’s only a few words
mumbled over you by a judge. We’ve got something between us nothing can
change.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: I suppose that’s true in a way. I am fond of
you, Walter. I often wish you weren’t such a stinker.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Now, that’s a nice thing to say.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Well, why did you promise me you wouldn’t
fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Well, I meant to let you go – but, you know,
you never miss the water till the well runs dry.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: A fellow your age, hiring an airplane to
write: ’Hildy: Don’t be hasty – remember my dimple. Walter.! It held
things up twenty minutes while the Judge ran out to watch it.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Well, I don’t want to brag, but I’ve still
got the dimple – and in the same place – I just acted like any husband
who doesn’t want to see his home broken up.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: What home?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: What home? Don’t you remember the home I
promised you?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Oh, yes – we were to have it right after our
honeymoon – honeymoon!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Was it my fault? Did I know that coal mine
was going to have another cave-in? I meant to be with you on our
honeymoon, Hildy – honest I did.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: All I know is that instead of two weeks in
Atlantic City with my bridegroom, I spent two weeks in a coal mine with
John Kruptzky – age sixty-three – getting food and air out of a tube!
You don’t deny that. Do you?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Deny it! I’m proud of it! We beat the whole
country on that story.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Well, suppose we did? That isn’t what I got
married for. What’s the good of – Look, Walter, I came up here to tell
you that you’ll have to stop phoning me a dozen times a day – sending
twenty telegrams – all the rest of it, because I’m –</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Let’s not fight, Hildy. Tell you what. You
come back to work on the paper and if we find we can’t get along in a
friendly way, we’ll get married again.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: What?!!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: I haven’t any hard feelings.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Walter, you’re wonderful in a loathesome sort
of way. Now, would you mind keeping quiet long enough for me to tell you
what I came up here for?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Sure, come on. We’ll have some lunch and you
can tell me everything.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: I have a lunch date. I just want –</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: You can break it, can’t you?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: No, I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Sure you can. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Don’t tell me what to do! We’re divorced –
I’m a free woman. You’re not my husband and you’re not my boss! And
what’s more, you’re not going to be my boss.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: What do you mean by that?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Just what I said. That’s what I –</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: You mean you’re not coming back to work
here?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: That’s the first time you’ve been right
today. That’s what I –</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: You’ve had a better offer, eh?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: You bet I’ve got a better offer.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Well, go on and take it. Work for somebody
else! That’s the gratitude I get for –</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: I know, Walter, but I –</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: What were you when you came here five years
ago? A little college girl from a School of Journalism! I took a little
doll-faced mugg –</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: You wouldn’t have taken me if I hadn’t been
doll-faced!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Why should I? I thought it would be a novelty
to have a face around here a man could look at without shuddering.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Listen, Walter –</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: I made a great reporter out of you, Hildy,
but you won’t be half as good on any other paper, and you know it. You
need me and I need you – and the paper needs both of us.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Well, the paper’ll have to learn to do
without me. And so will you. It just didn’t work out, Walter.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: It would have worked if you’d been satisfied
with just being editor and reporter. But no! You had to marry me and
spoil everything.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: I wasn’t satisfied! I suppose I proposed to
you!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Well, you practically did! Making goo-goo
eyes at me for two years till I broke down. And I still claim I was
tight the night I proposed. If you’d been a gentleman you’d have
forgotten all about it. But not you!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: You – you –</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: You’re losing your eye. You used to be able
to pitch better than that. Hello… Yeah… What? Sweeney? Well, what can I
do for you?</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: What’s the matter with you? Are you drunk?
This is Duffy, not Sweeney!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Sweeney! You can’t do that to me! Not today,
of all days! Jumping Jehosophat! Oh, no, Sweeney… Well, I suppose so…
All right. If you have to, you have to. How do you like that? Everything
happens to me – with 365 days in the year – this has to be the day.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Sweeney.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Dead?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Not yet. Might just as well be. The only man
on the paper who can write – and his wife picks this morning to have a
baby!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Sweeney? Well, after all, he didn’t do it on
purpose, did he?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: I don’t care whether he did or not. He’s
supposed to be covering the Earl Williams case and there he is – waiting
at the hospital! Is there no sense of honor left in this country?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Well, haven’t you got anybody else?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: There’s nobody else on the paper who can
write! This’ll break me, unless – Hildy!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: You’ve got to help me, Hildy.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Keep away –</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: It’ll bring us together again, Hildy – just
the way we used to be.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: That’s what I’m afraid of. “Any time – any
place – anywhere!”</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Don’t mock, Hildy, this is bigger than
anything that’s happened to us. Don’t do it for me! Do it for the
paper.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Get away, Svengali.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: If you won’t do it for love, how about money?
Forget the other offer and I’ll raise you twenty-five bucks a week.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Listen, you bumble-headed baboon –</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: All right – thirty-five, and not a cent
more!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Please! Will you just –</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Great grief! What’s that other paper going to
give you?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: I’m not working for any other paper!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Oh! In that case, the raise is off and you go
back to your old salary and like it. Trying to blackjack –</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Look at this!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Do you see this? Do you know what an
engagement ring is?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: I tried to tell you right away but you
started reminiscing. I’m getting married, Walter, and also getting as
far away from the newspaper business as I can get! I’m through.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Get married all you want to, Hildy, but you
can’t quit the newspaper business.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: You can’t sell me that, Walter.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Who says I can’t? You’re a newspaper man.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: That’s why I’m quitting. I want to go some
place where I can be a woman.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: I know you, Hildy, and I know what it would
mean. It would kill you.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: A journalist! Peeking through keyholes –
running after fire engines – waking people up in the middle of the night
to ask them if they think Hitler’s going to start a war – stealing
pictures off old ladies of their daughters that got chased by apemen! I
know all about reporters – a lot of daffy buttinskies going around
without a nickel in their pockets, and for what? So a million hired
girls and motormen’s wives will know what’s going on! No, Walter, I’m
through.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Where’d you meet this man?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Bermuda.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Bermuda… Rich, eh?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Not what you’d call rich. Makes about five
thousand a year.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: What’s his line?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: He’s in the insurance business.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: The insurance business?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: It’s a good, honest business, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Oh sure, it’s honest. But somehow, I can’t
picture you with a guy who sells policies.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Well, I can, and I love it! He forgets the
office when he’s with me. He doesn’t treat me like an errand-boy – he
treats me like a woman.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: He does, does he? How did I treat you – like
a water buffalo?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: I don’t know about water buffaloes, but I
know about him. He’s kind and sweet and considerate. He wants a home –
and children.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Say, sounds more like a guy I ought to marry.
What’s his name?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Well, I’ll give you a hint. By tomorrow
they’ll be calling me Mrs. Bruce Baldwin.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Tomorrow? Tomorrow… as quick as that?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: The quicker the better. Well – I finally got
out what I came in to tell you. So long, Walter, and better luck next
time.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: I wish you everything I couldn’t give you,
Hildy.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Thanks…</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Too bad I couldn’t see this guy first. I’m
pretty particular about whom my wife marries.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Well, he’s waiting in the anteroom for me
now.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Say, could I meet him?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Oh, better not, Walter. Wouldn’t do any
good.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: You’re not afraid, are you?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Afraid? I should say not!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: All right then, come on and let’s see this
paragon. Is he as good as you say?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Better.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Then what does he want with you?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Now you got me.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Nothing personal. I was just asking.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: After all –</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: You wouldn’t believe this, Walter, but Bruce
holds the door open for me.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: No kidding?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: And he takes his hat off when he’s with a
lady.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: And when he walks with a lady, he waits for
her!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Oh, I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Have Duffy call me in the restaurant in
twenty minutes.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Allow me.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: I can see right away my wife picked out the
right husband for herself.</p>
<p><strong>messenger</strong>: There must be some mistake. I’m already
married.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Already married! Hildy, why didn’t you tell
me?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Congratulations again, Mr. Baldwin!</p>
<p><strong>messenger</strong>: But my name –</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Mr. Burns!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Yeah? You’ll have to excuse me – I’m busy
with Mr. Bruce Baldwin here. Just leave your card with the boy.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: I’m very sorry, but I’m busy! Look – –
there’s the boy. Take your card and leave it with him.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Mr. Burns –</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: I’ve just told you I was busy with Mr. Bruce
Baldwin!</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I’m Bruce Baldwin!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: You’re Bruce Baldwin?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Then who are you?</p>
<p><strong>messenger</strong>: My name’s Pete Davis.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Pete Davis! Well, Mr. Davis, this is no
concern of yours and after this I’ll thank you to keep out of my
affairs!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: hand but grabs the umbrella and begins
shaking the handle</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: the umbrella, calling Burns’ attention to it,
and offers his</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Oh, I thought there was something funny… You
see, Bruce, you don’t mind if I call you Bruce, do you? After all, we’re
practically related –</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: by this time, and you can’t quite blame</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: You see, my wife – I mean, your wife – that
is, I mean Hildy – had led me to expect that she was marrying a much
older man.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: But I see, she didn’t mean old in years. You
always carry an umbrella, Bruce?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Well, er – it looked a little cloudy this
morning.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: That’s right. – Rubbers, too, I hope? A man
ought to be prepared for any emergency.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Attaboy! Come on, Bruce.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Where are we going?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Where are we going? I’m going to buy you two
lunch – didn’t Hildy tell you?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: No – she didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Just wanted to surprise you, I guess. Down!
After you, Bruce! Come on, Hildy, my treat!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: I suppose I can’t call this off without
creating a scene – but remember, it’s your last fling.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: How do you like that? Here I am being nice to
you and your sweet-heart and that’s the thanks I get!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Oh – after you, Hildy!</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Don’t tell me it’s you, Hildy!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Nobody else.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: How’s everything, Gus?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: I can’t complain.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Well, I can. I’m hungry. Roast beef sandwich
– rare. And some coffee.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Shall I put a little rum in the coffee? It’s a
nasty day.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Good idea. How about you, Hildy?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Oh – I’ll take the same, I guess. And
coffee.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Little rum in yours, too?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: I guess so.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: No – just coffee, Gus.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Just coffee. And you, sir?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Oh, I’ll take the same, I guess. And a glass
of milk.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Milk?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Milk.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: And don’t put any rum in it, Gus.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Well, so you’re getting married tomorrow, eh?
How does it feel, Bruce?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Feels awful good. Yes, sir – we’re taking the
four o’clock train to Albany and tomorrow we’ll be married.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Taking the train today – and being married
tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Oh, it isn’t like that.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: It will be perfectly all right, Walter.
Mother is coming with us on the train.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Mother? But your mother –</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: No. My mother.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Oh. Your mother – well, of course, that
relieves my mind.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Isn’t it sweet of Walter – still wanting to
protect me?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: I know I wasn’t a good husband, Hildy, but
you can always count on me.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I don’t think she’ll need you very much – I
aim to do most of the protecting myself.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Well, I’ll tell you one thing, old man, she
never looked at me the way she’s looking at you.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: I might have, Walter, but you were never
there.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Anyway, I’m glad you two are going to be
happy and have all the things I couldn’t give her. You know, Hildy is
about the best reporter in the country – and that goes regardless of
sex. But all she really ever wanted was a home.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Well, I’ll try to give her one.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: I know you will, Bruce. Are you going to live
with your mother?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Just for the first year.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: That’ll be nice. A home with mother. A real
honeymoon. In Albany, too. Ow!</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Mighty nice little town, Albany. They’ve got
the State Capitol there, you know.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Yes, I know… Hildy, will you ever forget the
night you brought the Governor back to your hotel room and found me
taking a bath? She didn’t even know I was in town…</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Well, here we are.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: How’s business, Bruce?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Well, Albany’s a mighty good insurance town.
Most people there take it out pretty early in life.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: I don’t blame them.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Oh, I’m sorry, Gus! My foot must have
slipped.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: That’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: I sometimes wish I’d taken out insurance –
but, of course, now it doesn’t matter. Still, I suppose it would have
been the smart thing to do.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Well, I honestly feel that way. I figure I’m
in one line of business that really helps people. Of course, we don’t
help you much when you’re alive – but afterward – that’s what
counts.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: I see what you mean.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Gus, this –</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Good coffee, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: You’ve forgotten my milk.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Oh. The milk. Yes.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Here’s luck to the bride and bridegroom.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: to respond with –</p>
<p><strong>bus boy</strong>: They want you on the phone, Mr. Burns.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: They would!</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: You know, Hildy, he’s not a bad fellow.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: You’re so nice, Bruce, you think everybody
else is.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Oh, he’s not the man for you. I can see that.
But I sort of like him. Got a lot of charm.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: He comes by it naturally. His grandfather was
a snake.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: If anybody had told me I’d be sitting at
lunch with him – but he swept me right off my feet.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: That’s what he did to me. Swept me right off
my feet – and left me lying on the floor.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Get this – get Sweeney off that yarn and out
of town on a two weeks’ vacation – and right away… All right, Duffy,
keep your shirt on. Hildy’s coming back… No. She doesn’t know it yet.
But she’ll be there. I promise you, Duffy. And tell Louie to stick
around.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Your milk, sir.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: And I brought you another cup of coffee,
Hildy.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Thanks, Gus.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Too hot?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: No. It’s strong. But I like it that way.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Say, what’s happened to Burns? He looks sunk,
doesn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: He certainly – hic – does!</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Anything the matter?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Just Sweeney again. One of my best
reporters.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: What now?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: His wife had twins and he went out to
celebrate and got as drunk as a lord. They can’t even find him. I tell
you, drink is the ruin of this nation.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: You said it.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: So – Sweeney gets twins – and Earl Williams
gets hanged tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Just what is the lowdown on Williams?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: It’s simple. A poor little dope who lost his
job went berserk and shot a cop who was coming after him to quiet him
down.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: If he’s nuts, why doesn’t the State just put
him away?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Because it happened to be a colored
policeman.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: The colored vote happens to be very important
to the Mayor of this town.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Especially with an election coming up in a
few days.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Are you sure Williams is not all there?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: All you’ve got to do is talk to him. But the
Mayor would hang his own grandmother to be re-elected.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: But couldn’t you show the man wasn’t
responsible?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: expression on his</p>
<p><strong>hildy’s voice</strong>: You could run an interview that would
prove it. Remember the interview I wrote with Jimmy Wellman? That saved
his life.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Yes, you could do it, Hildy. You could save
that poor devil’s life. You could – but – – you’re going away. I
forgot.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: How long would the interview take?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Oh – an hour for the interview. Another hour
to write it.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: We could take the six o’clock train, Hildy.
If it would save a man’s life.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: No, Bruce, dear. Don’t you see? This is a
trick to get your sympathy. No, Walter, I’ve been waiting for something
like this – but I wasn’t sure when you’d spring it. If you want to save
Earl Williams’ life, you can interview him yourself. You’re still a good
reporter. Bruce and I will be on that four o’clock train – and thanks
just the same.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: I’m an editor. I know what ought to be
written, but I can’t write it the way you could. It needs a woman’s
heart –</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Why, Walter, you’re getting poetic!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: You see what I had to put up with? She never
trusted me! You argue with her – otherwise you’re going on a honeymoon
with blood on your hands!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: How can you have any happiness after that?
All through the years you’ll remember that a man went to the gallows
because you were too selfish to wait two hours! I tell you, Earl
Williams’ face will come between you on the train tonight – and at the
preacher’s tomorrow – and all the rest of your lives!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: What a performance! Bravo! Don’t let him fool
you, Bruce – it’s only an act!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: What do you mean, only an act? Haven’t you
got any feeling?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Well, it’s either an act on your part or a
miracle on Sweeney’s.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: I happen to know Sweeney was married only
three months ago. If he’s got twins this morning, I claim it was done
with mirrors.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: All right, Hildy, I’m licked. But I’ll make
you and Bruce a business proposition.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: We’re not interested.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Maybe you’ll be. You’re a smart young man.
You let Hildy do this story for me and you can write out a $100,000.00
insurance policy for me. What do you say?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I don’t use my wife for business purposes,
Mr. Burns!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Wait a minute, Bruce. What’s commission on a
$100,000.00 policy?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Well, at his age, twenty payment life, a
little over a thousand dollars.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: And what’s the matter with a thousand
dollars?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: But –</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: According to the budget, we laid out that’s
more than our food bill for a whole year. Listen, Bruce, I don’t want
Walter Burns to use me, but I’m perfectly willing to use him. How long
will it take to get him examined?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I could get a company doctor in twenty
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Now you’re talking!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: You keep out of this. Bruce, suppose you
examine Mr. Burns in his office. I’ll get my bag and go over to the
Press Room in the Criminal Courts Building. You phone me as soon as
Mr. Burns has given you his check. Then I’ll go get the interview and
you phone Mother that we’re taking the six o’clock train. And no tricks,
Walter!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: What tricks would I pull?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Oh, nothing! Of course, you might cancel the
check. Yes! Wait a minute! What would be his first payment on that
policy?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: About twenty-five hundred dollars.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Better make that a certified check,
Walter.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: What do you think I am – a crook?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Yes — and that’s putting it mildly! No
certified check – no story – Get me?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: All right. The check will be certified. Want
my fingerprints?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: No thanks, I’ve still got those. Well, I’ll
step into some working clothes and hop over to the Press Room for the
background on this yarn. It’ll be kind of fun to see the boys again,
too. Remember, Bruce, it must be certified.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: All right, dear.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Wait a minute, Bruce. Have you got that
money?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: The five hundred? Sure.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: On second thought, would you let me have it?
I’ll get the tickets.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: But –</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Believe me, Bruce, I know what I’m doing.
He’d get you in a crap game –</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: But I don’t gamble, Hilda!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: I know a lot of men who didn’t do anything
till they met Walter Burns. Please, dear.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: All right. One – two – three – four – five.
Five hundred. Be careful, honey.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: I’ll be careful, darling. You be, please.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: So long, husbands.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I never knew Hildy to be so determined
before.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: You haven’t seen anything yet.</p>
<p><strong>endicott</strong>: Criminal Courts Press Room… This is
Endicott… No, nothing new on the Williams case yet boss. Well, you bet
I’m here plugging away every minute. Up a dime.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: By me.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Droparoo.</p>
<p><strong>mccue</strong>: I’ll call.</p>
<p><strong>endicott</strong>: Three sixes. Is that any good?</p>
<p><strong>hildy’s voice</strong>: It sure looks good from here.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: One at a time, boys.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: No, I’m not back for good. I’m just covering
the Earl Williams story for Mr. Sweeney who had a sudden attack of
something but will be all right by tomorrow. No, I haven’t made up with
Walter Burns – far from it! As a matter of fact, I’m leaving tonight for
Albany and I’ll be married tomorrow morning. The lucky man is Mr. Bruce
Baldwin, a gentleman in the insurance business – and when I say
gentleman, I mean gentleman! Are there any other questions?</p>
<p><strong>endicott</strong>: Well, that about covers everything.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Good. Now I want to ask you fellows a couple
of questions. Did Earl Williams know what he was doing when he fired
that gun?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: If you ask us, no. If you ask the state
alienists, the answer is yes.</p>
<p><strong>mccue</strong>: It’s a simple story. Earl Williams works for
the E.J. McClosky Manufacturing Company as a bookkeeper for fourteen
years. He starts in at twenty dollars a week and gradually works his way
up to twenty-two fifty. A year ago the McClosky Company goes out of
business and Williams loses his job. Take it away, Fred Wilson!</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Well – Williams goes a little balmy and
begins making speeches on a plan he’s got to save the world. Only he
makes his speeches, usually, on a very busy street and neglects to get a
license for it. Well, the cops let him alone as much as they can because
he’s harmless and they’re kinda sorry for him. But one day he decides to
hold a meeting right in the middle of a Veteran’s Parade and the cops
chase him. He gets scared and goes into hiding. Come in, Dave
Schwartz.</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: His Honor, the Mayor, now comes out with a
statement that Earl Williams is a dangerous character in the employ of
two or three foreign governments and the police are going to get him
dead or alive. Somebody sends out a tip that this guy is hiding in Molly
Malloy’s joint. And this colored policeman, Daniels, goes over to pick
Williams up. Williams has read the papers, thinks the cop is going to
kill him and shoots first. That is all.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Thanks, boys. That’s all I want to know.</p>
<p><strong>endicott</strong>: Say, that’s old Prissy Bensinger’s
desk.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: I know, I just want to give him a thrill.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: All right, boys, now that everything is
settled, deal me in.</p>
<p><strong>insert</strong>: CLOCK - Hands pointing to 2:45 PM.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Hello, this is Hildy Johnson. Get me Walter
Burns. Hello, Walter. How’s the old double- crosser?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Hello, my fine-feathered friend. Thought I
might be hearing from you. What have you got to report?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Going all right, eh?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Doctor, will you please keep quiet a minute?
How do you expect me to get any work done?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: How do you expect me to get anywhere if
you’re going to keep on that phone? If you’ll just give me two minutes
more –</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Well, they haven’t finished with me yet but
I’m hoping to get my shirt back. Oh, no. I’m in the pink of condition.
They found two new dimples.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: How about that check? All right, Mr. Burns,
but remember, no checkee – no story. Well, as soon as they decide
whether you live or not will you have that new man of mine call me up?
Yes, sir. All right, boys. Up a dime.</p>
<p><strong>endicott’s voice</strong>: Right back at you.</p>
<p><strong>mccue</strong>: You fight it cut.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: And up a dime.</p>
<p><strong>endicott</strong>: I call. What you got?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Three bullets! Any good?</p>
<p><strong>endicott</strong>: Beats king up.</p>
<p><strong>mccue</strong>: What are you going to do with all that money,
Hildy?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Yeah – you can’t spend it in Albany.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Oh, I’ll think of something.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Hello, Harvard! Got anything new on the
hanging?</p>
<p><strong>bensinger</strong>: Why don’t you fellows get your own
news?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Can’t you say ‘hello’ to a fellow?</p>
<p><strong>bensinger</strong>: Hildy!</p>
<p><strong>bensinger</strong>: Are you back?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: No, just a farewell appearance, batting for
Sweeney. I’m going into business for myself.</p>
<p><strong>bensinger</strong>: What doing?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: I’m getting married tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>bensinger</strong>: Well, congratulations! Good luck!</p>
<p><strong>endicott</strong>: Why don’t you use him for a bridesmaid,
Hildy?</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: Come on, Hildy, your deal.</p>
<p><strong>bensinger</strong>: Say, who put these stockings in my
desk?</p>
<p><strong>bensinger</strong>: disgust and picks up</p>
<p><strong>endicott</strong>: Why can’t they hang that guy at a
reasonable hour, so we can get some sleep?</p>
<p><strong>bensinger</strong>: Jake, new lead on the hanging. This new
alienist from New York – Dr. Max J. Egelhoffer – is going to interview
Williams in about half an hour – in the Sheriff’s office.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: That must be the tenth alienist they’ve had
on Williams. Even if he wasn’t crazy before, he would be after ten of
those babies got through psychoanalyzing him. Gimme the desk.</p>
<p><strong>endicott</strong>: This Egelhoffer’s pretty good.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Yeah? What did he ever do for his
country?</p>
<p><strong>endicott</strong>: Don’t you remember? He’s the guy went to
Washington to interview the Brain Trust, and gave out a statement that
they were all sane. It created a sensation!</p>
<p><strong>bensinger</strong>: Here’s the situation on the eve of the
hanging:</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: This is Murphy. More slop on the
hanging.</p>
<p><strong>bensinger</strong>: A double guard’s been thrown around the
jail, municipal buildings, railroad terminals, and elevated stations to
prepare for the expected general uprising of radicals at the hour of
execution.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Ready? The Sheriff’s just put two hundred
more relatives on the payroll to protect the city against the Red Army –
which is leaving Moscow in a couple of minutes. Up a dime.</p>
<p><strong>bensinger</strong>: The Sheriff has just received four more
letters threatening his life, but he says nothing can interfere with his
duty.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: And to prove to the voters that the Red
Menace is on the level, the Sheriff has written himself four more
letters, threatening his life. I know he wrote ’em on account of the
misspellings.</p>
<p><strong>endicott</strong>: Trouble is, when the Red Menace shows up
the Sheriff will still be crying ‘Wolf!’</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: What have you got, Hildy?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Kings and sixes.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: That’s good.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: ‘Kings and sixes The pot affixes’… Poetry. I
learned that at my grandma’s knee.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: That’s why I keep losing. My grandma was a
modest woman – nobody ever saw her knees, not even my grandpop.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I don’t know. This makes me feel funny.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Why shouldn’t I make Hildy my beneficiary?
I’ve got nobody else to leave it to.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I feel I ought to take care of her.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Well, you’ll take care of her. After all, if
that doctor’s right, I’m going to live for a long time yet. Look, Bruce,
this is a debt of honor. I was a very bad husband: Hildy could have got
a lot of alimony if she’d wanted to, but she wouldn’t take any. She had
it coming to her, but she was too independent.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Well, I’m independent, too.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Figure it this way: I ought to be good for
twenty-five years. By that time, you’ll probably have made enough so
that the money won’t mean anything. But suppose you haven’t made good –
don’t you think Hildy’s entitled to a quiet old age without any
worries?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Well, of course, if you put it that way.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: And remember this, Bruce! I love her,
too.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I’m beginning to realize that.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: And the beauty of it is she’ll never have to
know ’till I’ve passed on. Maybe she’ll think kindly of me — after I’m
gone.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Gee, you almost make me feel like a heel –
coming between you.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: No, Bruce, you didn’t come between us. It was
all over for her before you came on the scene. For me – it’ll never be
over.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: Here’s that certified check, Walter. I drew
out my wife’s savings, and if this isn’t back by 5:30 I’m a ruined
man!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Don’t worry, Duffy, you’ll have it back by
five. Thanks, Duffy. Stick around.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Well, Bruce, here you are – certified and
everything.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Certified! I’m afraid Hildy’d feel ashamed to
think she hadn’t trusted you.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Well, she’ll know some day.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: That’s all I ask. Oh, wait a minute.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Don’t want to forget this, you know. Might
start to rain again.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Thanks. I’ll phone Hildy right away to get
that story.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Well, anyway, I know Hildy’s getting a good
man.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Thanks a lot.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Well, I got to get back. You can find your
way out, can’t you?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Oh, sure. Well, thanks for everything.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Don’t thank me. I should thank you. So
long.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: So long.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: I don’t know why you boys are so good to
me.</p>
<p><strong>mccue</strong>: Your poker’s improved a lot, Hildy. Lend me
two bucks, will you?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Nothing doing. I’m playing for keeps.</p>
<p><strong>bensinger</strong>: I wish they’d stop that practicing.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Well, anyhow, I won’t be covering stuff like
this any more.</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: What’s the matter? Getting yellow?</p>
<p><strong>mccue</strong>: For you, Hildy.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Hildy Johnson… Oh, hello, Bruce. Have you got
it? Is it certified?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Certified and everything. Got it right here
in my wallet… What? No, he’s not here – I’m in a phone booth.</p>
<p><strong>mccue</strong>: Certified, eh? Who is it – your milkman?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: But, Bruce, don’t keep it in your wallet!…
Well, you see – – there’s an old newspaper superstition that the first
big check you get you – you put in the lining of your hat. That brings
you good luck for ten years.</p>
<p><strong>mccue</strong>: Say, I’ve been a reporter twenty years and
never heard any hooey like that. Where’d you get it?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: I made it up just now, and who’s asking you?
I know it’s silly, honey, but do it for me, won’t you?… Yes, right
now.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: All right. Wait a minute.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: All right. I’ve done it. Now, are you
satisfied?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Fine. And here’s a kiss for you.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Now, darling, you go back to the hotel and
pack and you and Mother pick me up here about half-past five. Goodbye,
dear.</p>
<p><strong>cooley</strong>: Hello, Hildy! What are you doing around
here?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: I want to interview Earl Williams, Warden.
How about a little service?</p>
<p><strong>cooley</strong>: No more interviews. Besides, a doctor’s
coming over.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Say, isn’t this your twenty dollars?</p>
<p><strong>cooley</strong>: I think it is.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: I thought so. Come on, I’m in a hurry.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: This guy stole my watch.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Have you got his watch?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: He’s crazy. I haven’t any watch.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I saw him. He put it in his back pocket.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I haven’t got –</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Wait a minute.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Is this yours?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Yeah! That’s it!</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: What about it?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I never saw it before.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Come on!</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Beat it!</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: My hat!</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Get his hat, somebody.</p>
<p><strong>williams</strong>: I couldn’t plead insanity, because you see
I’m just as sane as anybody else.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: You didn’t mean to kill that policeman?</p>
<p><strong>williams</strong>: Of course not. I couldn’t kill anybody –
it’s against everything I’ve ever stood for. They know it was an
accident. They’re not hanging me for that – they’re hanging me for my
beliefs.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: What are your beliefs, Earl?</p>
<p><strong>williams</strong>: They’re very simple. I believe in the
Golden Rule. I’m not the first man to die for preaching it. But if they
would only listen to it – we could have a fine, decent world instead of
this mass of hate that makes man do such cruel things.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: How would you go about applying the Golden
Rule, Earl?</p>
<p><strong>williams</strong>: I’d do away with the profit system and
have production for use only. There’s enough food and clothing and
shelter for everybody if we’d use some sense.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: “Production for use only.” Well, maybe that’s
the answer.</p>
<p><strong>williams</strong>: It’s the only answer. Everything has a use
and if we let it be used for its purpose, we could solve all our
problems. Food was meant to be eaten, not stored away in restaurants
while poor people starved; clothing was meant to be worn, not piled up
in stores while people went naked. Doesn’t that make sense?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Yes, that makes a lot of sense, Earl.</p>
<p><strong>william’s voice</strong>: Just use things for what they were
meant, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Sure. What’s the purpose of a gun, Earl?</p>
<p><strong>williams</strong>: A gun? Why – to shoot, of course.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Is that how you came to shoot the
policeman?</p>
<p><strong>williams</strong>: Sure. You see, I’d never had a gun in my
hand before and I didn’t know what to do with it. Well, when I get
stuck, I know that there’s an answer for everything in production for
use. So it came to me in a flash: what’s a gun for? To shoot! So I shot.
Simple isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Very simple, Earl.</p>
<p><strong>williams</strong>: There’s nothing crazy about that, is
there?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: No, Earl, not at all. Who sent you the
flowers, Earl?</p>
<p><strong>williams</strong>: Miss Mollie Malloy. She’s a wonderful
person.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Isn’t that her picture?</p>
<p><strong>williams</strong>: Yes. Isn’t she beautiful?</p>
<p><strong>hildy’s voice</strong>: If you should be pardoned, are you
figuring on marrying Mollie?</p>
<p><strong>earl’s voice</strong>: Oh, no, she’s much too good for
me.</p>
<p><strong>hartman’s voice</strong>: How’d you get in here?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Same way you did. Through that gate.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: I gave strict orders that nobody was to
interview Williams without my permission.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: All right, then, I’ll just run the story that
Sheriff Hartman is afraid to let reporters interview his prisoner. Of
course, with election coming, that might do you a lot of harm, but just
as you say.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Now, wait a minute! I’m not afraid of
anything. What were you going to write about Williams?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Oh, nothing much. Just that the state had
proved he was sane – and he admits it himself. If you don’t want me to
run it –</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Oh, that’ll be all right, Hildy. Go ahead,
run it. And you can say I treated him well, too. ’Lo, Earl. How are you
feeling?</p>
<p><strong>williams</strong>: Fine, thanks, Sheriff.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: That’s good, Earl. Oh, they’ve got another
alienist to see you. He ought to be here any minute. Don’t go to sleep,
will you?</p>
<p><strong>williams</strong>: I won’t.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Hildy, how’d you like a couple of tickets
for the hanging?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Williams won’t</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: You ought to stay over. You always wrote a
good hanging story, Hildy.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: That’s awful kind of you, Sheriff. I’ve got
to get started on my interview. See you later.</p>
<p><strong>williams</strong>: Don’t forget about production for use.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: I won’t, Earl.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Well, a guy can win when Hildy ain’t
around.</p>
<p><strong>endicott</strong>: Who’s this guy she’s gonna marry?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Baldwin – his name is.</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: I give that marriage six months.</p>
<p><strong>mccue</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: Hildy won’t be able to stay away from a
paper any longer than that. Did you see her eyes light up when she came
in here? Like an old fire horse.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: She says she’s gonna write fiction.</p>
<p><strong>endicott</strong>: Well, if she’s gonna write fiction,
there’s nothing like being a reporter.</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: I’ll give ten to five that marriage won’t
last six months. Hildy’s a newspaper man. She’s got headlines in her
veins – the way we all have or we’d be out of these lousy jobs.</p>
<p><strong>mccue</strong>: Well, well – Miss Mollie Malloy.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Hello, Mollie.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: How’s tricks, Mollie?</p>
<p><strong>mollie</strong>: I’ve been lookin’ for you tramps.</p>
<p><strong>endicott</strong>: Kid, those were pretty roses you sent
Earl. What do you want done with them tomorrow morning?</p>
<p><strong>mollie</strong>: A lot of wise guys, ain’t you?</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: You’re breaking up the game, Mollie. What
do you want?</p>
<p><strong>mollie</strong>: I want to tell you what I think of you – all
of you.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Keep your shirt on.</p>
<p><strong>mollie</strong>: If you was worth breaking my fingers on, I’d
tear your face wide open.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: What are you sore about, sweetheart? Wasn’t
that a swell story we gave you?</p>
<p><strong>mollie</strong>: You crumbs have been making a fool out of me
long enough!</p>
<p><strong>bensinger</strong>: She oughtn’t be allowed in here!</p>
<p><strong>mollie</strong>: I never said I loved Earl Williams and was
willing to marry him on the gallows! You made that up! And about my
being his soul-mate and having a love-nest with him.</p>
<p><strong>endicott</strong>: You’ve been sucking around that cuckoo
ever since he’s been in the death- house. Everybody knows you’re his
sweetheart.</p>
<p><strong>mollie</strong>: That’s a lie! I met Mr. Williams just once
in my life when he was wandering around in the rain without his hat and
coat on, like a sick dog, the day before the shooting. I went up to him
like any human being would and I asked him what was the matter, and he
told me about being fired after working at the same place for fourteen
years, and I brought him up to my room because it was warm there.</p>
<p><strong>murphy’s voice</strong>: Aw, put it on a phonograph!</p>
<p><strong>mollie</strong>: Just because you want to fill your lying
paper with a lot of dirty scandal, you got to crucify him and make a
stooge out of me!</p>
<p><strong>endicott</strong>: Got a match?</p>
<p><strong>mollie</strong>: I tell you he just sat there talking to me –
all night. And never once laid a hand on me. In the morning he went
away, and I never saw him again till that day at the trial!</p>
<p><strong>mollie</strong>: Go on, laugh! I’d like to know some curses
bad enough for your greasy souls! Sure, I was his witness – the only one
he had. Yes – me – cheap little Mollie Malloy! I’m everything the
District Attorney said I was. And still I was the only one with guts
enough to stand up for him! I told the truth and the District Attorney
knows it! That’s why you’re persecutin’ me! Because Earl Williams
treated me decent and not like an animal – and I said so!</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Go into your dance! This is the Press Room.
We’re busy.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Why don’t you go and see your boy-
friend?</p>
<p><strong>endicott</strong>: But you’ll have to hurry up – he left a
call for seven A.M.</p>
<p><strong>mollie</strong>: It’s a wonder a bolt of lightning don’t come
down and strike you all dead!</p>
<p><strong>endicott</strong>: Don’t get hysterical, kid.</p>
<p><strong>mollie</strong>: Shame on you!</p>
<p><strong>mollie</strong>: A poor little fellow that never meant nobody
no harm! Sitting there alone this minute with the Angel of Death beside
him, and you cracking jokes!</p>
<p><strong>murphy’s voice</strong>: If you don’t shut up, we’ll give you
something to cry about!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Come on, Mollie. This is no place for
you.</p>
<p><strong>mollie</strong>: They’re not human!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: They’re newspaper men, Mollie. They can’t
help themselves. The Lord made them that way.</p>
<p><strong>mollie</strong>: Hildy leads her out</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: You guys wanna play some more poker?</p>
<p><strong>endicott</strong>: What’s the use? I can’t win a pot.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Who? Hildy Johnson? She just stepped out.
She’ll be back in a second. Who? Oh, Mr. Baldwin. Well, if you’ll hang
on a minute, she ought to be right in. All right.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Baldwin. The blushing bridegroom –
himself.</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: What’s he want?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Wants Hildy – and sounds very excited.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Gentlemen of the Press! Always picking on
somebody who can’t defend himself – the littler the better.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Phone for you, Hildy.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Oh, some insurance man. Are you in?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Give me that!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Hello! Hello! Bruce?… what?… Where are you?…
You’re where?… How did that happen?… I’ll be right over!</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Boy, did you see her go?</p>
<p><strong>endicott</strong>: Lioness Rushes to Defense of Cub.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: I told you Baldwin was in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>mccue</strong>: Probably went out without his hankie and
wants Mamma to wipe his nose.</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: I still give that marriage six months.</p>
<p><strong>bensinger</strong>: Hello, baby, get me the Sheriff’s offico,
will you… Hello, Sheriff Hartman?… This is Bensinger. How about that
favor? You know what: once and for all, will you hang this guy at five
A.M. instead of seven? It won’t hurt you and we can make the City
Edition.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Once and for all, I’m not going to hang
anybody except at the legal hour… What? Don’t threaten me, Bensinger!
I’m not afraid of any newspapers. Yeah?… Oh, shut up! And, operator, I
told you not to disturb me! I don’t care who calls – I don’t want to be
disturbed again till I tell you! How do you like that, Dr. Egelhoffer?
Want me to hang williams at their convenience!</p>
<p><strong>egelhoffer</strong>: The newspapers! Sheriff, they’re the
scum of modern civilization.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: You said it!</p>
<p><strong>egelhoffer</strong>: They’re always after me for
interviews.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Me, too.</p>
<p><strong>egelhoffer</strong>: Of course, I sort of promised them I
would give out a statement when I got through here. You don’t mind?</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Well, I don’t know if that’s ethical. You
see, all statements are supposed to come from me.</p>
<p><strong>egelhoffer</strong>: We’ll have to satisfy them. What would
you say to giving them a joint interview? I could give them some of the
psychological aspects of the case and you could give them the legal
aspects.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: A joint interview, eh? That might be all
right. We could have our pictures taken together, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>egelhoffer</strong>: Yes, shaking hands. I don’t take a very
good picture, though.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: It doesn’t matter. The publicity’s the main
thing.</p>
<p><strong>egelhoffer</strong>: Yes, I suppose so. It all helps.</p>
<p><strong>williams</strong>: Are you gentlemen all through with me?</p>
<p><strong>egelhoffer</strong>: Oh, I’m sorry. I forgot you were here.
No, Mr. Williams, we still have some questions for you. Sheriff, will
you kindly extinguish the lights?</p>
<p><strong>egelhoffer</strong>: You know you are to be executed,
Mr. Williams. Who do you feel is responsible for that?</p>
<p><strong>williams</strong>: The system. But I’m not afraid to die,
Doctor. I’m dying for what I believe.</p>
<p><strong>egelhoffer</strong>: I see. You realize, however, that you
committed a crime?</p>
<p><strong>williams</strong>: In a legal sense, yes. But not actually.
Actually, I’m innocent. I didn’t do anything.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I’m innocent. I didn’t do anything. I never
stole a watch in my life.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: I know you didn’t, Bruce.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Let him out of here, Lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: But, Hildy, I can’t. He’s accused of
stealing a watch. And they found the watch on him.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: And who accused him? Diamond Louis! One of
the worst crooks in town! Why don’t you arrest Louis instead of innocent
people that he frames?</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: Now, Hildy –</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Don’t Hildy me! Are you going to let him
out?</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: All right. You can’t. But tomorrow the Post
will run the story of that roulette game on 43rd Street that your
brother-in-law runs. And we’ll print that you get five hundred a month
for forgetting about it!</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: Now, Hildy, don’t be hasty! I can’t let
him out.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: You can let him out on bail, can’t you?</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: Five hundred dollars.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: You’ll take fifty and like it!</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: Well, all right. But I’m liable to get
into a jam.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: You’ll get into a worse one if you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I lost my wallet.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: The check, Bruce!</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: That’s right here. Gee, it was lucky your
telling me about that old newspaper superstition.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Yes, wasn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I can’t imagine who did it. I can’t think of
any enemies I have.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: I’m sure you haven’t any.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: For a minute, I thought maybe Walter Burns
was at the back of it. But then I realized he couldn’t have been.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Oh, no. How could you ever think of such a
thing?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Oh, I realized right away. He’s really a very
nice fellow, Hildy – I found that out.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Yes, he is… Look, Bruce, we’re taking that
next train – and when I say next train, this time I mean it!</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Did you finish the interview?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: The Criminal Courts Building.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: No – but I’m sure it’ll be all right with
Walter.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: But, gee, Hildy – he gave us that insurance
business – and you promised –</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Well, the story’s practically finished. I’ll
just go upstairs and send it over with a messenger.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: No, you stay here. I’m not taking any more
chances. I’ll be down in three minutes – and don’t you dare move!</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: “But the State has a production for use
plan, too. It has a gallows and at seven A.M., unless a miracle occurs,
that gallows will be used to separate the soul of Earl Williams from his
body. And out of Molly Malloy’s life will go the one kindly soul she
ever knew –” That’s as far as Hildy got. But, I ask you, can that girl
write an interview?</p>
<p><strong>bensinger</strong>: I don’t think it’s very ethical reading
other people’s stuff.</p>
<p><strong>endicott</strong>: Don’t give us that ethics stuff. You’ll be
the only one who’ll swipe any of it.</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: I still say anybody that writes like that
ain’t going to give it up permanently to sew sox for a guy in the
insurance business. Now I give that marriage three months and I’m laying
three to one. Any takers?</p>
<p><strong>hildy’s voice</strong>: I’ll take that bet.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: It’s getting so a girl can’t step out of the
room without being discussed by a bunch of old ladies. Hello, Post…
Mr. Walter Burns, please.</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: Well, Hildy, we were only saying that a
swell reporter like you wouldn’t give this up so easily.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: This is Hildy Johnson… Oh, I can give it up
all right. Without a single quiver. I’m going to live like a human being
– not like you rats. Oh, is that you, Walter dear? Oh, I didn’t mean
“dear.” That was just habit, I guess. Oh, be yourself, Walter. I’ve got
some news for you… Yes, I got the interview, but I’ve got some news
that’s more important.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Better get a pencil out and write it down.
All ready? Get this, you double-crossing chimpanzee, there ain’t gonna
be any interview and there ain’t gonna be any story… Huh? That certified
check of yours is leaving with me in twenty minutes. And if I ever see
you again, it’s going to be just too bad… Eh?… Oh, you don’t know what
I’m angry about, do you? If you come over I’ll be very glad to tell you
the story of Louie’s watch. I dare you to come over, you – you – skunk
in sheep’s clothing! And bring that bodyguard of yours, too – you’ll
need him.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: …And I just want you to listen to one more
thing.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Hear that? That’s the interview I wrote… Yes,
I know we made a bargain. I just said I’d write it – I didn’t say I
wouldn’t tear it up. Yes, it’s all in little pieces now, Walter, and I
hope to do the same for you some time!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: And that’s my farewell to the newspaper game.
I’m going to live a normal life and have a home.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: I’m going to be a woman, not a newsgetting
machine. I’m going to have babies and nurse them and love them and give
’em cod liver oil and worry about their new teeth – and the minute I
catch one of them even looking at a newspaper, I’m going to brain him!
Where’s my hat?</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: Hello, Mr. Burns. Yes, she’s still
here.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: I’ll take it. What’s the matter, Mr. Burns –
don’t you understand English? – Why, your language is shocking,
Mr. Burns – positively shocking! I don’t mind because I was married to
you and know what to expect, but suppose Central is listening in… Oh,
did you hear that, Central? We ought to report him, don’t you think?…
Oh, fooey on you!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Now where was that hat? Oh, yes.</p>
<p><strong>williams</strong>: I hope you’re pretty nearly through with
me, Doctor, I’m getting a little fatigued.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Yeah, you don’t want to tire him out,
Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>egelhoffer</strong>: Just one thing more. I’d like to reenact
the crime, Mr. Williams. May I have your gun, please, Sheriff?</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: I don’t know –</p>
<p><strong>egelhoffer</strong>: Come, come, Sheriff, lightning doesn’t
strike in the same place twice. Nothing’s going to happen.</p>
<p><strong>egelhoffer</strong>: Now, the Sheriff will be Mollie Malloy,
in whose room you were. You will be Earl Williams. And I will be the
policeman. Follow me, Mr. Williams?</p>
<p><strong>williams</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>egelhoffer</strong>: So – now I say to you: ‘Earl Williams,
you are under arrest!’ and you point your gun at me.</p>
<p><strong>williams</strong>: Well, it wasn’t exactly that way –</p>
<p><strong>egelhoffer</strong>: Point the gun at me!</p>
<p><strong>egelhoffer</strong>: Then what did you do?</p>
<p><strong>williams</strong>: Now can I go, please?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Hey, Sheriff! Open up! What happened?</p>
<p><strong>endicott</strong>: Goodbye, Yonson.</p>
<p><strong>mccue</strong>: So long, Hildy.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Send us a postcard, kid.</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: Who’ll keep the lamp in the window for
you.</p>
<p><strong>bensinger</strong>: Goodbye, Hildy.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Well, goodbye, you wage-slaves. When you’re
crawling up fire escapes, getting kicked out of front doors, and eating
Christmas dinners in one- armed joints, don’t forget your pal, Hildy
Johnson! And, remember, my husband sells insurance!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: “It takes a heap o’ livin’ to make a house a
home.”</p>
<p><strong>voices from courtyard</strong>: Get the riot guns! Spread
out, you fellows! Etc.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: There’s a jail-break!</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Cooley! What’s the matter What’s
happened?</p>
<p><strong>voices from yard</strong>: Watch the gate! He’s probably
trying the gate!</p>
<p><strong>endicott</strong>: Who got away? Who was it?</p>
<p><strong>voice outside</strong>: Earl… Williams!!!</p>
<p><strong>the reporters</strong>: Who? Who’d he say? Earl Williams! It
was Earl Williams! He got away! Etc.</p>
<p><strong>mccue</strong>: Holy —! Gimme that telephone! Hurry! Hurry
up! This is important!</p>
<p><strong>mccue</strong>: Look out!</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Look out where you’re aiming, will you?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Ahhh –</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Morning Post?… Get me Walter Burns – quick!
Hildy Johnson calling.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Walter?… Hildy. Earl Williams just escaped
from the County Jail. Yep… yep… yep… don’t worry! I’m on the job!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Cooley, I want to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>cooley</strong>: Hildy – I can’t. I’m busy – I – Let me up,
Hildy. Earl Williams has escaped –</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: There’s money in it, Cooley.</p>
<p><strong>cooley</strong>: I can’t Hildy. It means my job! It means
–</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: A lot of money. Four hundred and fifty
dollars –</p>
<p><strong>cooley</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Four hundred and fifty dollars. Is it a
deal?</p>
<p><strong>cooley</strong>: It’s a deal. Let me up.</p>
<p><strong>cooley</strong>: Let’s see the money.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: First we talk. How did Earl Williams get that
gun?</p>
<p><strong>cooley</strong>: Come on, and I’ll tell you.</p>
<p><strong>endicott</strong>: Endicott talking.</p>
<p><strong>endicott</strong>: No – nobody knows where he got the gun,
but I think Mollie Malloy smuggled it in to him. He ran up the
fire-escape, and went back in the infirmary window. Then he got out
through the skylight. He must have slid down the rain-pipe to the
street.</p>
<p><strong>murphy’s voice</strong>: Gimme the Desk.</p>
<p><strong>endicott</strong>: No, I tell you! Nobody knows where he got
it.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: The Crime Commission has offered a reward of
ten thousand dollars for Williams’ capture.</p>
<p><strong>endicott</strong>: Call you back.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: No clue yet as to Earl Williams’
whereabouts. Here’s a little feature though: There’s been an accident
about a tear bomb –</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Wilson talking.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Yeah – tear bomb. Criminals cry for it.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: If the Mayor wants me, he knows where I
am.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: This tear bomb went off unexpectedly in the
hands of Sheriff Hartman’s Bombing Squad.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: What went off?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Four of Mr. Hartman’s Deputy Sheriffs were
rushed to the hospital –</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: A fine fair-weather friend you are!</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: The names are Merwyn D. Mayor, who is the
Mayor’s brother-in-law –</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: After all I’ve done for you –</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Howard Shenken, the Sheriff’s uncle on his
mother’s side –</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Hello, Jim? Sidelights on Sheriff Hartman’s
manhunt.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: William Lungren, who is the Sheriff’s
landlord, and Lester Bartow who married the Sheriff’s niece. You
remember, the very homely dame. Call you back.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Mrs. William Tausig, age fifty-five, scrub
lady, while at work scrubbing the eighth floor of the Commerce Building,
was shot in the left leg by one of Sheriff Hartman’s deputies.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: There goes another scrub lady.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: I’ll go right after it.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Any dope yet on how he got out?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: From all I can get the Sheriff let him out
so’s he could vote for him.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: I’m very disappointed in you, Hildy
Johnson.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: How do you suppose Williams got that
gun?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Give me Walter Burns – quick –</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Walter, listen. I’ve got the inside story on
how Williams got the gun and escaped.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Exclusive? That’s great.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: It cost me four hundred and fifty bucks to
tear it out of Cooley.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Never mind that. What’s the story?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Never mind it? That’s not my money! That’s
Bruce’s money!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: You’ll get it. Now what’s the story? I’ll
have the paper send the money right down to you. I swear it on my
mother’s grave.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Wait a minute. Your mother’s alive.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: I meant on my grandmother’s grave. Don’t be
so technical, Hildy. What’s the story?!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Well, this expert Dr. Egelhoffer, from New
York, decides to make Williams re-enact the crime –</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Well, I’m coming to it. It seems the
Professor had to have a gun to re- enact the crime with – and who do you
suppose supplied it? Nobody else but that great thinker, Sheriff
Hartman!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: No kidding, Hildy. Say, this isn’t a rib?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: No, this is on the level, Walter. I’m not
good enough to make this one up. The Sheriff gave his gun to the
Professor, the Professor gave it to Earl, and Earl gave it right back to
the Professor – right in the stomach! Who? No, Egelhoffer wasn’t hurt
badly. They took him to the County Hospital where they’re afraid he’ll
recover.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: That’s great work, Hildy… Huh? Oh, will you
stop worrying about the money? I’ll see you get it in fifteen
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: It better be fifteen minutes, because Bruce
is waiting downstairs in a taxicab and that meter’s clicking away to
beat the band.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Hold on a minute.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: over receiver of</p>
<p><strong>blonde</strong>: I’ve never flopped on you, have I?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Then scram! You’ve got about two minutes.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Sorry to keep you waiting. How much was it
again? Four hundred and fifty dollars? Hang on a second.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: I need four hundred and fifty dollars in
counterfeit money. You know where I can get it?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: It’s awful funny – I happen to have some on
me.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: It’s coming right over. I’m sending it over
with Louis. Thanks for the story and good luck on your honeymoon.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Keep the thanks, but just see that the money
gets here!</p>
<p><strong>mccue</strong>: Hello, Hildy. I thought you were gone.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: I thought so, too.</p>
<p><strong>mccue</strong>: McCue speaking. Mrs. Phoebe DeWolfe,
eight-sixty-one and a half South State Street, colored, gave birth to a
pickaninny in a patrol wagon with Sheriff Hartman’s special Rifle Squad
acting as nurses. Well – Phoebe was walking along the street when all of
a sudden she began – that’s right. So the police coaxed her into the
patrol wagon and they started a race with the stork. When the pickaninny
was born the Rifle Squad examined him carefully to see if it was Earl
Williams who they knew was hiding somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>mccue</strong>: Did you get that, Hildy?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: No – what?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Hello – Bruce! I thought you were downstairs
in a – What? Arrested again! What for this time, Bruce? Mashing! Oh,
Bruce, can’t I leave you alone for three minutes even? Well, where are
you? The 27th Precinct? All right, I’ll be right over – I’ll be over in
twenty minutes, Bruce. If I ever see Walter Burns – Get me Walter Burns…
Hildy Johnson! Well, he was there just a minute ago! Have him call me
back!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: If Walter Burns calls, hold the wire for me,
will you? I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>mccue</strong>: Okay, Hildy. Well, we can’t get any official
statement –</p>
<p><strong>mccue</strong>: Oh, wait a minute – here’s the Mayor. Maybe
he’ll give us one.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Don’t pester me now, please. I got a lot on
my mind.</p>
<p><strong>mccue</strong>: His Honor won’t say anything.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Have you seen Sheriff Hartman?</p>
<p><strong>mccue</strong>: It’s hard to say, Your Honor. The place is so
full of cockroaches.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Say, Your Honor, what effect’s this
jail-break going to have on the colored voters?</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Not an iota. In what way can an unavoidable
misfortune of this sort influence the duty of every citizen, colored or
otherwise?</p>
<p><strong>endicott</strong>: Your Honor, is there a Red Menace or ain’t
there?</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Hartman, I’ve been looking for you!</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: So have we!</p>
<p><strong>endicott</strong>: What’s the dope, Sheriff?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Who engineered this getaway?</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Just a minute! We’ve got him located.</p>
<p><strong>endicott</strong>: Williams?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Where he used to live. You can catch the
Riot Squad – it’s just going out.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Pete, I want to talk to you!</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: I ain’t got time, Fred, honest. I’ll see
you after.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Did you actually give Williams that gun?</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: The professor asked me for it – I thought
it was for something scientific!</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Pete, I’ve got a mighty unpleasant task to
perf –</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: Hiya, Your Honor. Schwartz calling. How
about it, Your Honor? Any statement on the Red uprising tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: What Red uprising?</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: There’ll be no Red uprising!</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: Gimme rewrite – The Governor says the
situation calls for the militia.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: You can quote me as saying that anything the
Governor says is a tissue of lies.</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: Hello, Jake. Here’s a red-hot statement
from the Governor. He claims that the Mayor and the Sheriff have shown
themselves to be a couple of eight-year-olds playing with fire.</p>
<p><strong>schwartz’ voice</strong>: Quote him as follows: “It is a
lucky thing for the city that next Tuesday is Election Day, as the
citizens will thus be saved the expense of impeaching the Mayor and the
Sheriff.” That’s all – call you back.</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: Nice to have seen you, Mayor.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: We’ve got to go somewhere private, Pete. I’ve
got to talk to you straight from the shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Now, listen, Fred. Just give me a few hours
before you make any decisions. I’ll get results. I’m doing everything
humanly possible. I’ve just sworn in four hundred deputies.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Four hundred! Do you want to bankrupt this
administration?</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: I’m getting them for twelve dollars a
night.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Twelve dollars! – For those rheumatic uncles
of yours? Out shooting everybody they see for the fun of it?</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: If you’re talking about my brother- in-law,
he’s worked for the city fifteen years.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Pete, you’re through!</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: What do you mean – through?</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: I mean I’m scratching your name off the
ticket Tuesday and running Czernecki in your place. It’s nothing
personal. And, Pete – it’s the only way out. It’s a sacrifice we all
ought to be glad to make.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Fred!</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Now, Pete! Please don’t appeal to my
Sentimental side.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Fred, I don’t know what to say. A thing
like this almost destroys a man’s faith in human nature.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: I wish you wouldn’t talk like that, Pete.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Our families, Fred. I’ve always looked on
Bessie as my own sister.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: If there was any way out…</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: There is a way out. I’ve got Williams
surrounded, haven’t I? What more do you want? Hello… Yes… Hello! Four
hundred suppers! Nothing doing! This is a man-hunt – not a banquet!… The
twelve dollars includes everything!!</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: That gives you an idea of what I’m up
against!</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: We’re up against a lot more than that with
that nutty slogan you invented: ‘Reform the Reds With a Rope’.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Williams ain’t a Red, and you know it!</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Well, there’s a lot of Communistic
sympathizers around –</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: I know it! But they’ve got nothing to do with
this case! Do you realize there are two hundred thousand votes at stake
and unless we hang Earl Williams we’re going to lose ’em?</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: But we’re going to hang him, Fred. He can’t
get away.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: What do you mean he can’t get away?! He got
away, didn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Who’s out there?</p>
<p><strong>voice outside</strong>: Is Sheriff Hartman in there?</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Ah! For me!</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: I’m Sheriff Hartman. You want me?</p>
<p><strong>pinkus</strong>: You’re certainly a hard fellow to find,
Sheriff.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>pinkus</strong>: from his pocket and proffering it to</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: What’s from the Governor?</p>
<p><strong>pinkus</strong>: The reprieve for Earl Williams.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: For who?</p>
<p><strong>pinkus</strong>: Earl Williams. The reprieve.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: W-wait a minute.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: The Governor gave me his word of honor he
wouldn’t interfere. Two days ago!</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: And you fell for it, Pete. It frightens me
what I’d like to do to you. Who else knows about this?</p>
<p><strong>pinkus</strong>: They were all standing around when he wrote
it. It was after they got back from fishing.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Get the Governor on the phone!</p>
<p><strong>pinkus</strong>: You can’t get him on the phone. He’s out
duckshooting now.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Fishing! Duckshooting! How do you like that.
A guy does nothing more strenuous for forty years than play pinochle –
he gets elected Governor and right away he thinks he’s Tarzan!</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Read it! Insane, he says. He knows very
well that Williams ain’t insane!</p>
<p><strong>pinkus</strong>: Yeah. But I –</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Pure politics!</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: An attempt to ruin us!</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Dementia praecox Oh-h-h!</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: We got to think fast before those lying
reporters get hold of this. What’ll we tell ’em?</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Tell ’em the party is through in this State
on account of you.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Ah, Fred – Hello… this is Hartman –</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: And you can tell ’em as an afterthought that
I want your resignation now!</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Sssh. Wait, Fred. What?… Where?… Where?
Holy Moses!</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: They got him! Wait a minute – hold the
wire. They got Earl Williams surrounded – the Riot Squad has – in his
house.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Tell ’em to hold the wire.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: I did. Hold the wire.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Cover up that transmitter!</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Now, listen! You never arrived here with this
– reprieve. Get it?</p>
<p><strong>pinkus</strong>: Yes, I did, just now. Don’t you
remember?</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: How much do you make a week?</p>
<p><strong>pinkus</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: How much do you make a week? What’s your
salary?</p>
<p><strong>pinkus</strong>: Forty dollars.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: No – don’t out me off.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: How would you like to have a job for three
hundred and fifty dollars a month. That’s almost a hundred dollars a
week!</p>
<p><strong>pinkus</strong>: Who? Me?</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Who do you think!</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Now, listen. There’s a fine opening for a
fellow like you in the City Sealer’s office.</p>
<p><strong>pinkus</strong>: The what?</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: The City Sealer’s office!</p>
<p><strong>pinkus</strong>: You mean here in the city?</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Yes, yes!</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Well, wait a minute, will you? I’m in
conference.</p>
<p><strong>pinkus</strong>: No, I couldn’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>pinkus</strong>: I couldn’t work in the city. You see, I’ve
got my family in the country.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: But you could bring ’em in here! We’ll pay
all your expenses.</p>
<p><strong>pinkus</strong>: No, I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: For heaven’s sake, why not?</p>
<p><strong>pinkus</strong>: I got two kids going to school there, and if
I changed them from one town to another, they’d lose a grade.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: No, they wouldn’t – they’d gain one! And I
guarantee that they’ll graduate with highest honors!</p>
<p><strong>pinkus</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Hold your horses – will you, Olsen? Hurry
up, Fred!</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Now what do you say?</p>
<p><strong>pinkus</strong>: This puts me in a peculiar hole.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: No, it doesn’t. Now, remember: you never
delivered this. You got caught in the traffic, or something. Now, get
out of here and don’t let anybody see you.</p>
<p><strong>pinkus</strong>: But how do I know…?</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Come in and see me in my office tomorrow.
What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>pinkus</strong>: Pinkus.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: All right, Mr. Pinkus, all you’ve got to do
is lay low and keep your mouth shut. Here! Go to this address. It’s a
nice, homey little place, and they’ll take care of you for the night.
Just tell ’em Fred sent you. And here’s fifty dollars on account.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Will you wait, Olsen? I’ll tell you in a
minute!</p>
<p><strong>pinkus</strong>: You forgot to tell me what a City Sealer has
to do.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: I’ll explain it tomorrow!</p>
<p><strong>pinkus</strong>: Is it hard?</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: No! It’s easy – it’s very easy!</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Just one second –</p>
<p><strong>pinkus</strong>: That’s good, because my health ain’t what it
used to be.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: We’ll fix that, too.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Just – one – second!</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: All right. Tell ’em to shoot to kill.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Shoot to kill, I said.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: I don’t know, Fred. There’s that reprieve
if they ever find out.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Nobody reprieved that policeman he murdered.
Now, do as I tell you.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Hello, Olsen… Listen… Shoot to kill… That’s
the orders pass the word along… No! We dont want him! And listen, Olsen,
five- hundred bucks for the guy that does the job… Yes, I’ll be right
out there. Well, I hope that’s the right thing to do.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Now take that guilty look off your face, Pete
– and stop trembling like a horse.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: If we didn’t have election Tuesday I’d have
this on my conscience.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Will you try –</p>
<p><strong>louie’s voice</strong>: Hildy.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Louie!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Have you got my dough?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Oh, sure. The boss sent me over with it. Four
hundred dollars, wasn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Four hundred and fifty and I’ll cut your
throat if you try any tricks!</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: All right, all right. You can’t blame a guy
for tryin’, can you?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Come on with that money!</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: First you got to sign a receipt.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Where’s the money?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Keep your shirt on. I got it – right here.
One hundred – two hundred – three hundred – four hundred – and fifty.
Now sign.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Here!</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Thanks. So long, Hildy!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: So long, nothing! Where’s Bruce Baldwin’s
wallet?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: None of that innocent stuff, you
double-crossing hyena! You stuck Bruce Baldwin in jail this afternoon on
a phony charge that he swiped your watch, and you frisked his wallet!
Now, give me that wallet or I’ll stick you in jail and it won’t be on
any phony charge either! It’ll be for life!</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Now don’t get excited, Hildy! I don’t know
what you’re talking about – but is this Mr. Baldwin’s wallet?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: You know it is!</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I didn’t frisk him. He must have dropped it
in Burns’ office. I didn’t know whose it was.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: No – and you don’t know that your cheap boss
has had Mr. Baldwin arrested again – do you?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: What – already? Why, the dame left only a
minute before I did!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: 27th Precinct Station House?</p>
<p><strong>williams</strong>: Drop that phone –</p>
<p><strong>williams</strong>: by holding on to</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Put down that gun, Earl.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: You’re not going to shoot me, Earl. I’m your
friend, remember? I’ve got to write that story about your “Production
for Use”.</p>
<p><strong>williams</strong>: Yes – that’s right. Production for
use.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Earl, you don’t want to hurt your friends, do
you?</p>
<p><strong>williams</strong>: Don’t move!</p>
<p><strong>williams</strong>: Maybe you’re my friend and maybe you’re
not – but don’t come any nearer. You can’t trust anybody in this crazy
world. Say, I’ll bet I could shoot you from here.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Sure you could, Earl – but you wouldn’t want
to do that, would you? You wouldn’t want to kill anybody.</p>
<p><strong>williams</strong>: No, no, you’re right. I don’t want to kill
anybody. All I want to do is be let alone.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Earl, there’s just one thing I ought to clear
up for the interview.</p>
<p><strong>williams</strong>: What’s that? Only – you’re getting too
near. I don’t trust anybody.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: I don’t blame you, Earl. If I were in your
place I wouldn’t trust anybody, either.</p>
<p><strong>williams</strong>: Keep away!</p>
<p><strong>williams</strong>: I guess I used all the shells.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Earl, you must never do that again.</p>
<p><strong>williams</strong>: Oh, I’m awful tired. I couldn’t go through
another day like this.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Well, maybe you think I could!</p>
<p><strong>earl’s voice</strong>: I’m not afraid to die. I was tellin’
the fella that when he handed me the gun.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Don’t talk too loud.</p>
<p><strong>williams</strong>: Wakin’ me up in the middle of the night –
talkin’ to me about things they don’t understand. Callin’ me a
Bolshevik. I’m an anarchist. It’s got nothin’ to do with bombs. It’s the
philosophy that guarantees every man freedom. You see that, don’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Sure I do, Earl.</p>
<p><strong>williams</strong>: I wish they’d take me back and hang me. I
done my best.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Hello… Gimme Walter Burns – quick!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Hello – hel – Oh, hello, Bruce… Oh, Bruce,
please – I know I said I’d be down in fifteen minutes, but something
terrific’s happened! Hang on, Bruce – Walter?… Hildy. Come over here –
right away!… Wait! Bruce, just a second, Bruce – I’ll explain
everything. Walter! Get this: I’ve got Earl Williams… Yes! Here in the
Press Room… Honest! On the level. Hurry – I need you.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Bruce, this is the biggest thing that ever
happened… I just captured Earl Williams – you know – the murderer –</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Bruce, I’ll be down – Well, Bruce, the minute
I turn him over to the paper I’ll be right down. Bruce, don’t you –
Bruce, I can’t now – I can’t, don’t you realize?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Who’s there?</p>
<p><strong>mollie’s voice</strong>: It’s me, Mollie Malloy! Let me
in.</p>
<p><strong>mollie</strong>: Where are they gone? You know where they
are?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Wait a minute, Mollie.</p>
<p><strong>mollie</strong>: They got him surrounded some place – gonna
shoot him like a dog!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Mollie, they haven’t got him. You gotta help
me, Mollie! We’ve got to do something!</p>
<p><strong>mollie</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>mollie</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Quiet, Mollie!</p>
<p><strong>mollie</strong>: There’s somethin’ funny going on around
here.</p>
<p><strong>williams</strong>: Hello, Mollie.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Quiet, Mollie, quiet!</p>
<p><strong>williams</strong>: Don’t cry, Mollie, there’s nothing to cry
about.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: How’d you get here, Earl?</p>
<p><strong>williams</strong>: Down the drainpipe. I didn’t mean to shoot
him. You believe me, don’t you, Mollie?</p>
<p><strong>mollie</strong>: Of course I believe you.</p>
<p><strong>williams</strong>: I forgot to thank you for those roses.
They were beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>mollie</strong>: That’s all right, Mr. Williams… You’re a
woman. You got to help us. You got to get him out of here, some place
where I can take care of him.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Stop screaming, Mollie or we’re sunk. I’m
trying to think of something before those reporters get back.</p>
<p><strong>williams</strong>: Let ’em take me. It’s better that way.</p>
<p><strong>mollie</strong>: No – I’ll never let ’em!</p>
<p><strong>mollie</strong>: They’ll get him! They’ll get him!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Ssh!</p>
<p><strong>endicott</strong>: Who locked the door?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Just a second, Mike — Mollie, I got it!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Can you get in this desk?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: What’s going on in there?</p>
<p><strong>williams</strong>: What good’ll it do?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: We’ll get you out in ten minutes.</p>
<p><strong>endicott</strong>: Open up there, will you!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: All right – all right!</p>
<p><strong>mollie</strong>: Go on! Please!</p>
<p><strong>williams</strong>: They’ll find me anyhow.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: I’m coming! Keep dead quiet. Don’t even
breathe.</p>
<p><strong>mollie</strong>: I’ll be right here. I won’t leave you.</p>
<p><strong>endicott</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Mollie, drop down here! You’ve fainted!</p>
<p><strong>mollie</strong>: What’s the idea?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Never mind! Just play dead.</p>
<p><strong>mollie</strong>: Hey –</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Shut up, you!</p>
<p><strong>endicott</strong>: Kind of exclusive, ain’t you? We got calls
to make, you know.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Run down and get some smelling salts, will
you?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Smelling salts! What’s going on here?</p>
<p><strong>endicott</strong>: Mollie Malloy – what happened to her?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Came up here – had hysterics and passed out.
I’ve been trying to get her to come to.</p>
<p><strong>endicott</strong>: She looks as though she’s going to come
to.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Give me a hand with her, will you?</p>
<p><strong>endicott</strong>: Okay. Up you go, Mollie.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: City Desk.</p>
<p><strong>endicott</strong>: She’ll be all right. The Desk.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Well, they surrounded the house, all right,
only they forgot to tell Williams, and he wasn’t there.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: has been fastening</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Well – I was going, but Mollie fainted away
and I thought I ought to do what I could.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Some Hallowe’en goin’ on outside. The whole
police force standing on it’s ear.</p>
<p><strong>mccue</strong>: What a chase!</p>
<p><strong>endicott</strong>: No luck on Williams, yet – call you
back.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Okay, later.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Murphy talking.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Any news?</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: Yeah. I was never so tired in my life.</p>
<p><strong>mccue</strong>: Where? Harrison Street Station? All right,
connect me.</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: Schwartz calling… Out with Hartman’s
deputies. I’m in a drugstore. You can’t call me back because I’m going
right on with them.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Are you all right, now?</p>
<p><strong>mollie</strong>: Yeah, I’m feelin’ fine.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Sure, Mollie, you never looked better in
your life.</p>
<p><strong>mccue</strong>: Yeah, hold the line. Hey, this looks good. An
old lady just called the detective bureau and claims Williams is hiding
in her cellar. Well - we’ve looked every other place. Want to go out on
it?</p>
<p><strong>endicott</strong>: Aw, nuts with chasing around any more. I
spent a dollar-forty on taxis already.</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: I say we don’t go out any more. Let Earl
Williams come to us.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: A fine bunch of reporters. Biggest story in
two years and they’re too lazy to go after it.</p>
<p><strong>endicott</strong>: It’s easy for you to talk. You’re retired.
We’re still working.</p>
<p><strong>mccue</strong>: Okay. Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: What’s the matter with you boys? Afraid it
might rain? If you want to go, I’ll cover this end.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Say, Hildy, if I know you, you sound pretty
anxious to get rid of us. Are you trying to scoop us or something?</p>
<p><strong>endicott</strong>: Something smells around here. If you ask
me Mollie gave her the story on how Williams got that gun. Did you
smuggle that gun into Williams, Mollie?</p>
<p><strong>mollie</strong>: I didn’t do nothin’.</p>
<p><strong>mccue</strong>: Come clean, Mollie.</p>
<p><strong>endicott</strong>: Better let us in on it, Mollie.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Aw, why don’t you let her alone? She’s
ill!</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Oh, you two are pals now – I think you’re
right, Endicott. Mollie did give her some kind of story.</p>
<p><strong>endicott</strong>: I tell you, it’s a screwy set-up. We
better hold onto ’em both.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. baldwin</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Mother!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. baldwin</strong>: Don’t you mother me! Playing cat-and-
mouse with my poor boy! Keeping him looked up – making us miss two
trains – and supposed to be married tomorrow!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Mother, I can explain everything. I’ll go
with you in five minutes and –</p>
<p><strong>mrs. baldwin</strong>: You don’t have to go with me at all!
Just give me my son’s money and you can stay here forever as far as I’m
concerned. Stay with that murderer you caught!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. baldwin’s voice</strong>: Which one of these men is it?
They all look like murderers to me!</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Where does she get that stuff?</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: Shall we tell her what she looks like?</p>
<p><strong>endicott</strong>: Wait a minute! What murderer did you
catch, Hildy?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: I don’t know what she’s talking about. I
never said any such thing.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. baldwin</strong>: I’m quoting my son, and he has never
lied to me.</p>
<p><strong>reporters</strong>: I knew something stunk around here – Who
says she caught him –? What do you mean she caught a murderer –?
etc.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: But I never said anything like that!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. baldwin</strong>: Yes, you did!</p>
<p><strong>mollie</strong>: She never told her that!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: I said I was trying to catch one. You got it
balled up, Mother.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: What do you know about it? How do you know
she didn’t?</p>
<p><strong>mollie</strong>: Let go!</p>
<p><strong>endicott</strong>: Hold on to her, Jimmy – she’s in with
Hildy on this.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Who you holding out on? Come clean, or we’ll
make you wish you had –</p>
<p><strong>endicott</strong>: Hildy, are you gonna cross us for Walter
Burns after the way you told him off?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Give in, Hildy – you can’t get away with
it.</p>
<p><strong>mollie</strong>: Wait! You stool-pigeons! She don’t know
where Williams is. I’m the one that knows.</p>
<p><strong>endicott</strong>: What do you mean, you know?</p>
<p><strong>mollie</strong>: Go find out, you heels! You don’t think I’m
gonna tell!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Let her alone! She’s goofy!</p>
<p><strong>reporters</strong>: Look out! Close that door! etc., etc.</p>
<p><strong>mccue</strong>: You ain’t gettin’ out o’ here!</p>
<p><strong>endicott</strong>: Now, where is he?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Where you hidin’ him?</p>
<p><strong>mollie</strong>: I ain’t gonna squeal! I ain’t goin’ to!</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Come on, you! Before we slap you down.</p>
<p><strong>endicott</strong>: Do you want us to call the cops and have
them give you the boots?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Where is he, before we beat it out of
you?</p>
<p><strong>mollie</strong>: Don’t you come near me, you kidney foot!</p>
<p><strong>mollie</strong>: Let me alone or I’ll knock your heads
off!</p>
<p><strong>endicott</strong>: Put down that chair!</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: Get around – get on the side of her.</p>
<p><strong>mollie</strong>: No, you don’t! Keep away!</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Grab her!</p>
<p><strong>mollie</strong>: You’ll never get it out of me! I’ll never
tell! Never!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. baldwin</strong>: Take me out of here! Take me – Oh-h
–</p>
<p><strong>mccue</strong>: Get the cops, somebody.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Come on, fellas.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Gee! The poor kid… the poor kid.</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: Get a doctor! Take her to the infirmary! She
ain’t killed – she’s moving!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Walter! D-did you see – – that?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Yes. Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: She jumped out of the window.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: I know. Where is he, I said.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. baldwin</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>burns’ voice</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. baldwin</strong>: I won’t shut up! That girl killed
herself. Oh-h, you’re doing something wrong. What’s in that desk?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Louie, take this lady over to Polack Mike’s
and lock her up. See that she doesn’t take to anyone on the way.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. baldwin</strong>: What’s that – what’s that?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Wait a minute, Walter. You can’t do that!</p>
<p><strong>louie</strong>: as if to shake hands</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Tell ’em it’s a case of delirium tremens.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Now, let go of her, Louie. Listen, Walter,
this’ll get me in a terrible jam with my fianc�e and I don’t stand so
well with him now. Don’t worry, Mother, this is only temporary.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Where do you think you’re going?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Let go o’ me! I’ve got to get Bruce out of
jail! Oh, Walter, why did you have to do this to me?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Get Bruce out of jail! How can you worry
about a man who’s resting comfortably in a quiet police station while
this is going on? Hildy, this is war! You can’t desert now!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Oh, get off that trapeze! There’s your story!
Smear it all over the front page – Earl Williams caught by the Morning
Post! And take all the credit – I covered your story for you and I got
myself in a fine mess doing it – and now I’m getting out! I know I told
you that twice before today – but this time I mean it!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: You drooling idiot! What do you mean, you’re
getting out! There are three hundred and sixty-five days in the year one
can get married – but how many times have you got a murderer locked up
in a desk? – Once in a lifetime! Hildy, you’ve got the whole city by the
seat of the pants!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: I know, but –</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: You know! You’ve got the brain of a pancake!
That wasn’t just a story you covered – it was a revolution! Hildy! This
is the greatest yarn in journalism since Livingstone discovered Stanley
for the New York Herald!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Wait a minute – wasn’t it Stanley who
discovered Livingstone?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Don’t get technical at a time like this! Do
you realize what you’ve done? You’ve taken a city that’s been
graft-ridden for forty years under the same old gang and with this yarn
you’re kicking ’em out and giving us a chance to have the same kind of
government that New York’s having under La Guardia! We’ll make such
monkeys out of these ward-heelers next Tuesday that nobody’ll vote for
them – not even their wives!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: I’d like to think.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Well, think it then, because it’s true! We’ll
crucify that mob. We’re going to keep Williams under cover till morning
so the Post can break the story exclusive. Then we’ll let the Governor
in on the capture – share the glory with him.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: I get it!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: You’ve kicked over the whole City Hall like
an apple-cart. You’ve got the Mayor and Hartman backed against a wall.
You’ve put one administration out and another in. This isn’t a newspaper
story – it’s a career! And you stand there belly-aching about whether
you catch an eight o’clock train or a nine o’clock train! Still a
doll-faced mugg! That’s all you are.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Let me get at that typewriter and I’ll show
you how a doll-faced mugg can write!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Attagirl! Why, they’ll be naming streets
after you – Hildy Johnson Street! There’ll be statues of you in the
parks, Hildy. The radio’ll be after you – the movies! By tomorrow
morning I’ll betcha there’s a Hildy Johnson cigar! I can see the
billboards now. Light up with Hildy Johnson!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Whoa – wait a minute. We can’t leave Williams
here. One of the other fellows’ll –</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: We’re going to take him over to my private
office. Where’s our phone?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: That one – how you gonna take him? They’ll
see him.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Not if he’s inside the desk. We’ll carry the
desk over. Give me Duffy!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: You can’t take that desk out. It’s crawling
with cops outside.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: We’ll lower it out of the window with
pulleys. Quit stallin’.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Hildy!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Huh!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Get the lead out of your typewriter and start
pounding out a load, will you? Snap into it!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: How much do you want on it?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: All the words you’ve got.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Where’s some paper?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Hello…! Hello!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Can I call the Mayor a bird of prey – or is
that libelous?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Call him a love-child, if you want to.
Duffy!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: How about the time he had his house painted
by the Fire Department?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Give him the works. Hello, Duffy, get set!
We’ve got the biggest story in the world. Earl Williams caught by the
Morning Post – exclusive!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Fine! Now, listen, Duffy – I want you to tear
out the whole front page… That’s what I said – the whole front page!
Never mind the European war! We’ve got something a whole lot bigger than
that. Hildy Johnson’s writing the lead and I’ll phone it over to you as
soon as she’s finished. Oh, Duffy! Get hold of Butch O’Connor and tell
him I want him to come up here with half a dozen other wrestlers – right
away! Tell him we’ll run his picture on the sport page for two weeks
straight. What? I’ve got a desk I want moved. Never mind what desk!</p>
<p><strong>burns’ voice</strong>: “The Blackest cesspool in American
city life!” Hold on Duffy, I’ll see if she’s got any more.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Duffy – Duffy! Operator! Operator! Get me
Duffy back. Somebody cut us off!</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Hildy!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: What the devil do you want? Listen, Bruce,
you can’t come in here now! We’re busy! Where you been, Duffy? Stick
around! What? What Chinese earthquake? The deuce with it… what’s
that?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Hildy!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Hello, Bruce…</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: BRUCE!! How’d you get out?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Not through any help of yours, Hildy.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Bruce, I know, but I was in the biggest jam
–</p>
<p><strong>burns’ voice</strong>: Hildy!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: For Pete’s sake, Hildy, they’re waiting for
the rest of that story!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Okay, Walter.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I waited and waited and then I had an idea
and wired Albany to send me a hundred dollars so I could get out on
bail… I don’t know what they’ll think – they sent it to the police
station!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: We’ll explain the whole thing to them.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I know I got you into this, Hildy, but it
does seem to me that you can’t care much for me if you’re willing to let
me stay locked up for two hours.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Bruce, you know I’m mad about you and stop
talking like that. Walter!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Take the President’s speech and run it on the
funny page… What is it, Hildy?</p>
<p><strong>hildy’s voice</strong>: What was the name of the Mayor’s
first wife?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: You mean the one who drank so much?
Tillie!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Get back in there, you mock turtle!</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Did you say anything, Mister Burns?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: No – I was just talking to one of the guys at
the office.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Oh. I wonder what’s keeping mother? She was
supposed to come down and get you.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Oh, she was here.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Where’d she go?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Out some place.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Hildy! Where’s mother?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Oh – mother – she – I don’t know where she
went.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Did you give her the money?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: No, I was going to give it to her – but she
left hurriedly.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Then suppose you give me the money. Four
hundred and fifty dollars.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Oh, yes. Here it is.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Here it is, Bruce. One – two – three – four
hundred – and fifty dollars.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: And I’ll take that certified check, too. I’ve
decided I can handle things around here…</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Come on, Hildy, we’ve got to keep going!
Sorry, Bruce, but –</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Just a second, Walter. Here, Bruce, here’s
the check… And, oh, Bruce, here’s your wallet. I got it back.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: You got it back, eh? There’s something funny
going on around here.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Hildy!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: All right, Walter.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I’m taking the nine o’clock train, Hildy. And
you can meet us at the station.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: I’ll see she’s there, Bruce, I promise
you.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: If she’s not there, mother and I are leaving
anyhow!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: I know how you feel, Bruce, but you’ve got to
forgive her. She’s only a woman, after all.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Suppose she is – I have feelings, too! Do you
know where I’ve been for the last couple of hours? Locked up in a police
station and she didn’t move to do anything about it.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Ts! Ts! Ts!</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: And now I don’t know where my mother is. She
may be lost.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: I’ll find her, Bruce, if I have to put every
detective in the city on the job. Tell you what – go over to the Missing
Persons Bureau and describe your mother. What does she look like?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: She’s – well, she’s very motherly. That’s
about the best description I know.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: That’s the kind of stuff they want!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Oh, Bruce, let me see that money Hildy gave
you.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: The money? Why?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: There’s a lot of counterfeit big bills going
around.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Gee! Take a look, will you?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Oh, this is all right, Bruce. I just wanted
to be sure.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Say, I want to be sure, too!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Duffy. Good. Stick close.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Now the moon’s out!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Fine. Three taps is me. Don’t forget! You’re
sitting pretty, now. Got enough air?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Is that better? Now breathe deep!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Attaboy!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: That’s the stuff! Lam it into ’em, Hildy.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Hello! Duffy, ready? Here we go!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: “In the darkest hour of the city’s history
–”</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Listen, did you impress it on Butch that I
want him and his gang here right away? You did? Every minute counts. All
right. Duffy’s getting old!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Where’s Butch?</p>
<p><strong>burns’ voice</strong>: He’s on the way.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: He’d better hurry. The boys’ll be coming back
to phone.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Well, keep going! We want an extra out on the
streets before it’s too late!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Where’s Bruce?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Bruce? Oh – er – he went out to get the
tickets.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: What tickets?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Railroad tickets.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Is he coming back here?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Didn’t you hear him? Of course he’s coming
back here. Keep going, will you?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Duffy!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>bensinger</strong>: What’s the idea of locking this?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: That’s Bensinger. That’s his desk.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: What’s his name?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Bensinger – of the Tribune.</p>
<p><strong>bensinger</strong>: Open this door!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: I’ll handle him.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: The Tribune, eh? Watch me!</p>
<p><strong>bensinger</strong>: Ain’t you got any more sense than to – ?
Oh, h-hello, Mr. Burns. Why, quite an honor having you come over
here.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Hello, Bensinger.</p>
<p><strong>bensinger</strong>: Excuse me, I just want to –</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: desk, suddenly</p>
<p><strong>hildy’s voice</strong>: Yeh.</p>
<p><strong>bensinger</strong>: How do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: I was having a little chat about you just
this afternoon – with our Mister Duffy.</p>
<p><strong>bensinger</strong>: Nothing – ah – detrimental, I hope.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: I should say not! That was one swell story
you had in the paper this morning.</p>
<p><strong>bensinger</strong>: Oh, did you – care for the poem,
Mr. Burns?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: The poem?… The poem was great!</p>
<p><strong>bensinger</strong>: Remember the ending? ” – and all is well,
outside his cell, But in his heart he hears the hangman Calling and the
gallows falling And his white-haired mother’s tears…”</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Heartbreaking! How would you like to work for
me?</p>
<p><strong>bensinger</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: We need somebody like you. All we’ve got now
are a lot of low-brows. Like Johnson here.</p>
<p><strong>bensinger</strong>: Seriously, Mr. Burns?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Duffy! I’m sending Bensinger over to see you.
Mervyn, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>bensinger</strong>: No. Roy. Roy V.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: at his own</p>
<p><strong>bensinger</strong>: Seventy-five.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: I’ll give you a hundred and a by- line.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Let him have everything he wants. Now hustle
and write me a story from the point of view of the escaped man. He
hides, cowering… Afraid of every light, of every sound… hears footsteps…
his heart going like that… And all the time they’re closing in… Get the
sense of an animal at bay!</p>
<p><strong>bensinger</strong>: Sort of a Jack London style?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Exactly!</p>
<p><strong>bensinger</strong>: I got my rhyming dictionary in –</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: It doesn’t have to rhyme!</p>
<p><strong>bensinger</strong>: Gee, I’m terribly grateful, Mister Burns.
Do you suppose there might be an opening some time as foreign
correspondent? I parley a little French, you know.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: I’ll keep you in mind.</p>
<p><strong>bensinger</strong>: Au revoir, mon capitaine.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Bon jour!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Mademoiselle from Armontieres, parlay –</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Duffy! Got this!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: A rat from the Tribune is coming over to get
a job – Bensinger, the guy I told you about. Handle him with kid gloves.
Tell him to get busy writing poetry… No, we don’t want him. Stall him
along until the extra comes out. Then tell him his poetry stinks and
kick him downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Double-crossing swine!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: You said it! But this’ll teach him a lesson.
He won’t quit his paper without giving notice after this.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Tear into it, will you? Don’t sit there like
a frozen robin!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: I’m finished.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Finished!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Duffy! All right – here we go! And got it out
as soon as you can. I want this paper out on the streets in half an
hour! “So once more the Morning Post –”</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Bruce ought to be back by now. Walter, you’re
not trying anything again, are you?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Hildy, you think I could? After this story?
Here! You’re just nervous.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>louie’s voice</strong>: It’s me, Boss – Louie.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: It’s Louie!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Where’s Mrs. Baldwin?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: What did you do with her?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: You been in a fight?</p>
<p><strong>louie</strong>: Down Western Avenue. We were going sixty-five
miles an hour. You know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Take that mush out of your mouth!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Where’s the old lady?</p>
<p><strong>louie</strong>: I’m telling you!</p>
<p><strong>louie</strong>: We run smack into a police patrol. You know
what I mean? We broke it in half!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Oh-h-h… was she hurt?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Where is she? Tell me!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Louie!</p>
<p><strong>louie</strong>: I’m telling you. Can you imagine bumping into
a load of cops?! They come rollin’ out like oranges!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: What did you do with her?</p>
<p><strong>louie</strong>: Search me! When I come to I was running down
Thirty-fifth Street.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: – You were with her. You were in the cab,
weren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>louie</strong>: Was I? The driver got knocked cold.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Butter-fingers! I give you an old lady to
take somewhere, and you hand her over to the cops!</p>
<p><strong>louie</strong>: What do you mean, I handed her? The patrol
wagon was on the wrong side of the street.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Now everything’s fine. She’s probably
squawking her head off in some police station.</p>
<p><strong>louie</strong>: I don’t think she’s talking much… You know
what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Don’t tell me – was she killed?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Was she? Did you notice?</p>
<p><strong>louie</strong>: Say, me with a gun on my hip and a kidnapped
old lady on my hands, I should stick around asking questions from a lot
of cops! You know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Dead… dead! That’s the end!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: It’s Fate, Hildy. What will be, will be.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: What am I going to say to Bruce? What’ll I
tell him?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: If he really loves you, you won’t have to
tell him anything. Snap out of it! Would you rather have had the old
dame dragging the whole police force in here?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: I killed her. I’m responsible. Oh- h… what
can I do now? How can I ever face him? Oh, I hope he never comes
back!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Look at me, Hildy –</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: I’m looking at you – you murderer!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: If it was my own mother, I’d carry on! You
know I would. For the paper!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Louie, where’d it happen? I’m going out!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: You stay here. I’ll find out everything.</p>
<p><strong>louie</strong>: Western an’ Thirty-fourth.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Hello – hello…</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Gimme Western four-five-five-seven.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Who? Hello, Butch! Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Mission Hospital? Gimme the Receiving
Room.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: What are you doing there? Haven’t you even
started?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Hello – Eddie? Hildy Johnson. Was there an
old lady brought in from an auto smashup?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Oh, for – H. Sebastian – Butch! Listen, it’s
a matter of life and death! Listen!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Nobody? Morningside three-one-two-four.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: I can’t hear… You got who? Speak up! A what?…
You can’t stop for a dame now!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Is this the Community Hospital?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: I don’t care if you’ve been after her for six
years! Butch, our whole lives are at stake! Are you going to let a woman
come between us after all we’ve been through?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Hello, Max, Hildy Johnson. Was there an old
lady –?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Butch! I’d put my arm in fire for you – up to
here! Now, you can’t double-cross me!… She does? All right – put her on.
I’ll talk to her… Hello! Oh, hello, Madam… Now listen, you ten-cent
glamour girl, you can’t keep Butch away from his duty… What’s that? You
say that again and I’ll come over there and knock your eye out! Hello?
I’ll kill ’em! I’ll kill both of ’em! Duffy! Mousing around with some
big blonde Annie on my time! That’s co-operation! Duffy!!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Shut up, will you? You sure? Nobody?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Duffy!!!! Duffy!!!! Well, where is Duffy?
Diabetes! I ought to know better than to hire anybody with a disease.
Louie.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: It’s up to you.</p>
<p><strong>louie</strong>: Anything you want, Boss.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Beat it out and get hold of some guys.</p>
<p><strong>louie</strong>: Who do you want?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: door, followed by</p>
<p><strong>louie</strong>: You know me. The shirt off my back.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: You got plenty of money?</p>
<p><strong>louie</strong>: Sure, boss.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: I mean real money – not counterfeit!</p>
<p><strong>louie</strong>: I always have both.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: And don’t bump into anything.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Lafayette two-one-hundred.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: That dumb immigrant’ll flop on me. I know it.
Can you imagine Butch doing this to me – at a time like this?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: If Louie doesn’t come back in five minutes
we’ll get it out alone. There’s millions of ways. We can start a fire
and get the firemen to carry it out in the confusion.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Ring that number, will you?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Come here. See if we can move it.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Hello – hello! Is this the Lying – In
Hospital? Did you have an auto accident in the last –</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Will you come here?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Oh, I see. I beg your pardon.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: When I’m surrounded, with my back against the
wall, you’re not going to lay down on me, are you –</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Hildy, you just can’t leave me out on a limb
now. It – it wouldn’t be cricket!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: I don’t care what you say. I’m going to find
Bruce’s mother. Oh-h… I’m going out and find her!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Don’t open that!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Who says so? I’m going to the morgue – to
look –</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: There she is!</p>
<p><strong>mccue</strong>: Say, Hildy…</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Just a minute, Johnson!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Let go o’ me. What’s the idea?</p>
<p><strong>mccue</strong>: What’s your hurry?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: We want to see you.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Take your paws off me!</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Hold her, boys!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Who do you think you are, breaking in here
like this?</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: You can’t bluff me, Burns. I don’t care who
you are or what paper you’re editor of.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Let me go! Fellows, something’s happened to
my mother-in-law.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Hang onto her! Keep her in here!</p>
<p><strong>mccue</strong>: We know what you’re up to.</p>
<p><strong>endicott</strong>: Probably goin’ out to get Williams.</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: The door was locked.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: She and Mollie were talking.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: I don’t know anything, I tell you. There’s
been an accident.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Johnson, there’s something very peculiar
going on.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: You can send somebody with me if you don’t
believe me!</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: I wasn’t born yesterday. Now the boys tell
me you and this Mollie Malloy –</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Nobody’s trying to put anything over on you.
I’m getting out of here and you can’t stop me!</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: You’re not going anywhere. She’s got the
story sewed up, Pete. That’s why Burns is here.</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: We’re on to you, Hildy. Let us in on
it.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: If you’ve any accusations to make, Hartman,
make them in the proper manner. Otherwise, I’ll have to ask you to get
out.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: You’ll ask me to what?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Get out!</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Close that door. Don’t let anybody in or
out.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Come on, Pinky! Give ’em a little third
degree.</p>
<p><strong>endicott</strong>: Make them talk and you got Williams,
Pinky!</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Johnson, I’m going to the bottom of this.
What do you know about Williams? Are you going to talk or aren’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: What do I know about Williams?</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: All right, boys. Take her along. I got ways
of making her talk.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Look out, you –</p>
<p><strong>mccue</strong>: What’s the use of fighting, Hildy?</p>
<p><strong>deputies</strong>: Hey, she’s got a gun! Look out, she’s got
a gun!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: No, you don’t! Walter!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: What is it? Here!</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Gimme that.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Where’d you get this?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: I’ve got a right to carry a gun if I want
to.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Not this gun!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: I can explain that, Hartman. When Hildy told
me she wanted to interview Earl Williams I thought it might be dangerous
and I gave her a gun to defend herself.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Oh, you did! Well, that’s very, very
interesting. This happens to be the gun that Earl Williams shot his way
out with!</p>
<p><strong>reporters ad lib</strong>: What? What’s that? Etc…</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Are you trying to make me out a liar?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: It’s the last time I ever trust a woman,
Hildy.</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: Maybe Williams was gonna be her best
man.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: That’s pretty rotten, Hildy. Crossing your
own pals.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Where is Earl Williams? Where you got
him?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: You’re barking up the wrong tree,
Hartman.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: I’ll give you three minutes to tell me
where he is.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: He went over to the hospital to call on
Professor Egelhoffer.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: With a bag of marshmallows.</p>
<p><strong>reporters ad lib</strong>: Come on, Hildy. Where is he?… This
is a sweet trick, Hildy… I thought we were friends… Etc. Look here,
Pete! What about Mister Burns?… Ask the Master Mind! What’s he doing
over here?</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Speak up! What do you know about this.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: My dear Hartman!</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Can that! Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: The Morning Post is not obstructing justice
or hiding criminals. You ought to know that.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: No? Well – Johnson, you’re under arrest.
You, too, Burns.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Who’s under arrest? You pimple-headed,
square-toed spy – do you realize what you’re doing?</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: I’ll show you what I’m doing. Burns, you’re
guilty of obstructing justice and so is the Morning Post. I’m going to
see that the Post is fined ten thousand dollars for this.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: You’ll see nothing of the kind, Sheriff.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: We’ll just start by impounding the Post
property. Is that your desk?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Yes! What are you afraid of Hildy? I dare him
to move that desk out of here.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Oh, you do, eh? All right, boys. Confiscate
that desk.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Hartman, if you take this desk out of this
building, I’ll put you behind bars.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: You will, eh? Well, we’ll see about that.
All right, boys. Take it.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: I’m warning you – it’ll be a Federal offense.
And you’ll be an accessory!</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: We’ll take a chance on that, Burns. Go
ahead, boys.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. baldwin</strong>: You wait outside, Bruce.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: But, mother –</p>
<p><strong>mrs. baldwin</strong>: No! You’ll weaken when you see that
little Jezebel! I’m going to tell her what I think of her!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Mother!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. baldwin</strong>: That man there!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Mother! Oh, I’m so glad to see you! Are you
all right? Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: What’s the idea here?</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: This lady claims she was kidnapped.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. baldwin</strong>: They dragged me all the way down the
stairs –</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Just a minute. Did – did – – this man have
anything to do with it?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. baldwin</strong>: He was the one in charge of
everything! He told them to kidnap me!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Are you referring to me, Madam?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. baldwin</strong>: You know you did!</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: What about this, Burns? Kidnapping, eh?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Oh, trying to frame me, eh! I never saw this
woman before in my life!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. baldwin</strong>: Oh, what a thing to say! I was
standing right here - after the girl jumped out of the window.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Did you get the Mayor?</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: He’s coming over.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Now, Madam – be honest. If you were out
joy-riding, drunk, and got into some scrape, why don’t you admit it,
instead of accusing innocent people?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. baldwin</strong>: You ruffian! How dare you say a thing
like that?</p>
<p><strong>hilda</strong>: Please, Mother, he’s just crazy!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. baldwin</strong>: I’ll tell you something more. I’ll
tell you why they did it!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Come on, Sheriff. We’ve got to get bail.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. baldwin</strong>: I was in here – and they had some kind
of murderer in with them. They were hiding him!</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Hiding him? In here?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Hiding him where?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Mother!</p>
<p><strong>reporters</strong>: Where was he?… Where’d they have him?…
Etc.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Madam, you’re a cockeyed liar! And you know
it!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Come on, Sheriff, we’ve got to get bail.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>reporters ad lib</strong>: He’s in the desk! – For the love
of – He’s in there! Etc.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Aha! I thought so! Stand back,
everybody!</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: Look out, Sheriff. He may shoot!</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Get your guns out!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: He’s harmless.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Don’t take any chances. Shoot through the
desk.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: He can’t hurt anybody. You’ve got his
gun.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. baldwin</strong>: Oh, dear! Oh, dear!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: You grey-haired old Judas!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. baldwin</strong>: Let me out! Let me out of here!</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: You stand there!</p>
<p><strong>murphy’s voice</strong>: City Desk! Quick!</p>
<p><strong>schwartz’ voice</strong>: Gimme the Desk!</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: You there!</p>
<p><strong>endicott’s voice</strong>: City Desk! Hurry!</p>
<p><strong>mccue’s voice</strong>: Gimme Emil…</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: with his gun toward</p>
<p><strong>murphy’s voice</strong>: Look out where you’re pointing that
gun!</p>
<p><strong>wilson’s voice</strong>: Lemme have the Desk! Quick!</p>
<p><strong>murphy’s voice</strong>: Hold the wire! I’ve got a flash for
you!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Call Duffy!</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: No, you don’t!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Do you want to get us scooped?</p>
<p><strong>mccue’s voice</strong>: Emil? Hang on for a second.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Now then, everybody aim at the center. And
when I say three –</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: That’s murder!</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: All right! Carl! Frank! One of you get on
each side of the desk. Take hold of the cover.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Now then! We got you covered, Williams.
Don’t try to move. Now! Everybody quiet and ready for an emergency. I’m
going to count three.</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: Hold it! Something coming up.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: One!</p>
<p><strong>endicott</strong>: Hold the phone!</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: I’ll have it in a minute.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Two!</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Right away now!</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Everybody ready? All right. Now then, up
with it.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Got you, Williams!</p>
<p><strong>williams</strong>: Go on – shoot me!</p>
<p><strong>murphy’s voice</strong>: Earl Williams was just captured in
the Press Room of the Criminal Courts Building, hiding in a desk.</p>
<p><strong>officers ad lib</strong>: Grab him! That’s him! Don’t let him
shoot! Stick ’em up! – Etc.</p>
<p><strong>mccue</strong>: …Williams in a rolltop –</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: – nabbed Williams hiding –</p>
<p><strong>endicott’s voice</strong>: – found Williams’ hiding
place.</p>
<p><strong>schwartz’ voice</strong>: He offered no resistance.</p>
<p><strong>mccue</strong>: Williams put up a desperate struggle but the
police overpowered –</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: – tried to shoot it out with the cops but
his gun wouldn’t work, so –</p>
<p><strong>wilson’s voice</strong>: – trying to break through the cordon
of police –</p>
<p><strong>endicott</strong>: Williams was unconscious when they opened
the desk –</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Duffy! The Morning Post just turned Earl
Williams over to the Sheriff.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Duffy!</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Put the cuffs on those two!</p>
<p><strong>endicott</strong>: An anonymous note received by the Sheriff
led to Williams’ capture. More later.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: An old sweetheart of Williams’ doublecrossed
him. Call you back.</p>
<p><strong>reporters</strong>: Where’s that old lady? Hey, Madam!
Where’d she go? Where’s the old dame? Etc., etc. They run out after
Mrs. Baldwin, the Mayor entering just after they go. Burns and Hildy,
handcuffed together, stand near the Sheriff.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Hello, girlie – gimme Cooley. Quick!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Hartwell, you’re going to wish you’d never
been born!</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Fine work, Pete! You certainly delivered the
goods. I’m proud of you.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Look kind o’ natural, don’t they, Fred?</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: A sight for sore eyes!</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Aiding an escaped criminal! And a little
charge of kidnapping I’m looking into. But that’s the jail! There must
be somebody there!</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Well! Looks like about ten years apiece for
you birds!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Does it? You forget the power that always
watches over the Morning Post.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Your luck’s not with you now!</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Cooley?… I caught Williams single- handed –
we’re going to proceed with the hanging per schedule!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: You’re going to be in office for exactly two
days more and then we’re pulling your nose out of the feed bag.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Give me the District Attorney’s office.
I’ll tell you what you’ll be doing – making brooms in the State
penitentiary. Hello, D’Arrasty! This is Hartwell. Come over to my
office, will you? I’ve just arrested a couple of important birds and I
want to take their confessions.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Duffy! Get Liebowitz!</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: All the lawyers in the world aren’t going to
help you!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: This is the Morning Post you’re talking
to!</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: The power of the press, huh!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Bigger men than you have found out what the
power of the press is… President!… Yes – and Kings!</p>
<p><strong>pinkus</strong>: the reprieve over</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Get out of here!</p>
<p><strong>pinkus</strong>: You can’t bribe me!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Get out of here, you!</p>
<p><strong>pinkus</strong>: I won’t. Here’s your reprieve.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>pinkus</strong>: I don’t want to be City Sealer. I don’t like
seals anyhow. They smell.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Who is this man?</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Throw him out, Frank.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Who was bribing you?</p>
<p><strong>pinkus</strong>: They wouldn’t take it.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: You’re insane!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: What did I tell you? An unseen power! What’s
your name?</p>
<p><strong>pinkus</strong>: Silas F. Pinkus.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: You drunken idiot! Arrest him! The idea of
coming here with a cock-and- bull story like that!</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: It’s a frame-up! Some imposter!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Wait a minute! Let go there!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Murder, uh?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Hanging an innocent man to win an
election!</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: That’s a lie!!</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: I never saw him before!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: When did you deliver this first?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Who did you talk to?</p>
<p><strong>pinkus</strong>: They started right in bribing me!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Who’s ‘they’?</p>
<p><strong>pinkus</strong>: Them!</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: That’s absurd on the face of it, Mr. Burns!
He’s talking like a child.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Out of the mouths of babes.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: He’s insane or drunk or something. Why, if
this unfortunate man, Williams, has really been reprieved, I personally
am tickled to death. Aren’t you, Pete?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Go on, you’d kill your mother to get
elected!</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: That’s a horrible thing to say, Miss Johnson,
about anybody! Now, look here, Walter, you’re an intelligent man –</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Just a minute. All right, Mr. Pinkus. Let’s
have your story.</p>
<p><strong>pinkus</strong>: Well, I been married for ten years and –</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Skip all that.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Take those handcuffs off our friends, Pete.
That wasn’t at all necessary.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: I was just going to!</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Walter, I can’t tell you how badly I feel
about this. There was no excuse for Hartwell to fly off the handle.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: I was only doing my duty. Nothing personal
in it.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: You guys better quit politics and take in
washing.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Sheriff, this document is authentic! Earl
Williams has been reprieved, this Commonwealth has been spared the
painful necessity of shedding blood.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Save that for the Tribune.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: What did you say your name was – Pinkus?</p>
<p><strong>pinkus</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>pinkus</strong>: Here’s the picture of my wife.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: A very fine-looking women.</p>
<p><strong>pinkus</strong>: She’s good enough for me! And if I was to go
home and tell my wife –</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: I understand perfectly, Mr. Pinkus, and as
long as I am Mayor –</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Which ought to be about three hours more, I’d
say.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Just until we can get out a special edition
asking for your impeachment.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: And your arrest. You’ll each get about ten
years, I think.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Don’t make any hasty decisions, Mr. Burns,
you might run into a thumping big libel suit.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: You’re going to run into the Governor.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Now, my old friend the Governor and I
understand each other perfectly.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: And so do I!</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: So do you what, you hoodoo! And now,
Mr. Pinkus, if you’ll come with us, we’ll take you over to the Warden’s
office and deliver this reprieve.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Wait till those two future jailbirds read the
Morning Post tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: How was that for a tight squeeze?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Don’t tell me you were worried!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Worried! I was petrified. Weren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Uh-uh. As long as we were in there together
pitching – they couldn’t lick us. Well, it’s been a lot of fun.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: In a way.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: I mean – working together. Just like the old
days. The things we’ve been through, Hildy.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: We’ve certainly been in some swell jams.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Remember the time we broke into the D.A.’s
office, and copied Fifi Randell’s diary?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Yeah. What about the time we hid the missing
heiress in the sauerkraut factory? Six scoop interviews!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Yeah - but that time we stole Old Lady
Haggerty’s stomach off the Coroner’s physician. We proved she was
poisoned though, didn’t we?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: We sure did, but we had to go in hiding for a
week.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: In the Shoreland Hotel. And our only chaperon
was the poor old lady’s stomach.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Don’t remind me. That’s how we happened to
–</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Sorry, Hildy. I didn’t mean to be making love
to another man’s fiancee.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: That’s all right, Walter. It’s as much my
fault as yours.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Bruce is making the nine o’clock train. I
told him you’d be on it – unless you want to write this story
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Well, if it’s my last story, I’d like it to
be a good one. But – I guess I can’t, Walter.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Suit yourself, kid. This isn’t for me to
decide. Of course, you could make a later train and still be in Albany
tomorrow morning.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Yeah. I suppose I could. But, Walter –</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: He’s going to have you the rest of his life,
Hildy. Can’t you give me another hour?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: I don’t know what to do, Walter.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Flip a coin.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: All right. Heads I go – tails I stay to write
the story. Ready?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Ready.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Well – what is it?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: What’s the difference? I’m going to write
that story – and you know it!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Hildy!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Don’t touch me! I’m not doing it for you!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Then why are you doing it?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Because I’m a newspaper woman, Heaven help
me!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: The greatest yarn ever written by anybody. My
hat’s off to you, Hildy!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: And what a way to quit. While you’re still
champion! That’s the way to leave, Hildy!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Yeah. Only – only I’m not leaving,
Walter.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: What do you mean? Bruce’ll be waiting for you
in Albany.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: No, he won’t. I wired him that I wasn’t
coming.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Where’d you wire him?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: On the nine o’clock train. That’s the one he
took, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: It’s awfully clear now. Bruce needs a wife
who can give him a home – and affection – and peace. I couldn’t do that
for him, Walter. I’m what you made me – a cheap reporter who’d give up
her soul for a story!… Is that job still open?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Both jobs are open, Hildy. The paper – and
being Mrs. Walter Burns.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Thanks, Walter, but it’s no good. We tried
it.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Sure, it was good – it was wonderful! Only
you expected it to be like other marriages. It can’t be like other
marriages – we’re different! We’re a different world. Look at what we
went through today. I wouldn’t trade that for any honeymoon in the
world. I bet you wouldn’t, either.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: A fine honeymoon, with a murderer right in
the boudoir! And that other honeymoon in a coal mine!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: That’s what makes it romantic. Every other
married couple goes away on a honeymoon and for two weeks the bride
knows just where the groom is, and vice versa. But us – you never know
where I am and I’m not sure where you are. That’s Romance!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Well, maybe I’d like to know just once!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Hildy, if that’s what you want, all right.
We’ll even go to – how about Niagara Falls?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Niagara Falls! Walter, you don’t mean
that?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Sure I do. And I’ll tell you something else –
I’d like a baby.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Walter!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Sure, I can’t last forever. I want a son I
can train to take my place on this paper.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: What would you do if it was a daughter?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Well, if she looked like you – Say! My brains
and your looks – that mightn’t be such a bad combination.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: What’s the matter with my brains?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: What’s the good of arguing about something
that probably doesn’t exist? Look, Hildy, I’m proposing to you. What do
you say?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Well, I’d like to be lady-like and think it
over.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: I don’t want to rush you. Take a couple of
seconds.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Hello, Judge!</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: This is an outrage, Mr. Burns! Sending a
gunman to kidnap me!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Now, wait a minute, Judge. This isn’t a
kidnapping. You’ve got the legal power to perform a marriage ceremony,
haven’t you?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: What!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Now don’t argue, Hildy. How about it,
Judge?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Yes, but –</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Then go ahead. Come on, Hildy.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Nobody’s going to rush me into anything! You
keep away from me!</p>
<p><strong>louie</strong>: All right, Judge.</p>
<p><strong>1st reporter</strong>: I’ll be doggoned! A shotgun
marriage!</p>
<p><strong>2nd reporter</strong>: Don’t they usually keep the gun on the
man?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: ” – so long as you both do live?”</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: I will.</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: That’s what he said the last time. Don’t
believe him, Judge.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Hildy, from this time on no tricks, no
double-crossing – everything on the level!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: You’re not fooling anybody.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: “Hildegarde Johnson, will you have this man
as your wedded husband, to live together in the ordinances and estate of
Matrimony?”</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: What would you do with a gun in your
back?</p>
<p><strong>louie</strong>: Quiet!</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: “Will you love him, comfort him, honor and
keep him in sickness or in health; –</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: If I know where he is.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: ” – and, forsaking all others, keep thee only
unto him, so long as you both do live?”</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: I will – if he will.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Have you got a ring?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: How about Bruce’s?</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Walter, you can’t do that!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Sure, I can. Look at the policy I gave him!
“With this ring I thee wed and with all my worldly goods I thee endow:
And thereto I plight thee my troth.”</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Say, I’m surprised she got the ring
back!</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: ” – pronounce you Man and Wife.”</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Hildy, darling!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Yes – ‘Hildy, darling’. I’m just a fool.
That’s what I am. I know what it’s going to be like.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: It’ll be Heaven!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Sure, Heaven! You’ve probably thought up
another coal mine to send me down in – to get a new story for your
paper!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Walter!</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: Counterfeit money! That’s the money you sent
me, Walter! You – you –</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: But, Hildy, listen –</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: But, Hildy – I can explain –</p>
<p><strong>hildy</strong>: You – you!!</p>
<p><strong>louie</strong>: I think it’s going to work out all right this
time.</p>
