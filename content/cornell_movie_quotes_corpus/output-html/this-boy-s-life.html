<p><strong>this boy’s life</strong>: Written by</p>
<p><strong>1 ext. highway - day 1</strong>: It is 1957, and we are in
the deserts of Utah. TONY BENNETT sings “Rags to Riches” on the
SOUNDTRACK. Breath-taking scenery stretches out on either side of a
highway. The CAMERA MOVES to reveal a Nash Ambassador as it labors up a
hill. Twelve cars are caught behind the thirty-mile- per-hour pace. Two
cars decide to ignore safety and cross the solid yellow line to pass the
pokey car.</p>
<p><strong>2 int. nash ambassador - parallel time 2</strong>: Two people
are in the straining car – a woman and her son. The woman is CAROLINE
WOLFF. Somewhere in her 30s, she is a pretty woman who can look
beautiful if she works at it. She is bright and energetic and lively.
Even more important than these qualities, though, is her humor. And most
important of all is a sensual quality she exudes. Her sensuality is
effortless – as natural to her as the color of her eyes and hair. Men
turn on the street to stare at her. The boy is TOBY WOLFF. A
pleasant-faced boy with won- derful eyes, he is 13 – teetering on the
brink of adolescence, so that one moment he seems like a self- assured
teenager, and the very next like a ten-year-old kid. Just now the
ten-year-old kid has the upper hand: bored and weary with the long trip,
Toby has been arguing with Caroline, who is ignoring him.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: … Well, I mean it. I’m serious – I do. You
promise and promise, and then you change your mind, just like that.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: … Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: You wait ’til you ask me for something. Just
wait. See if you get it.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Toby, hush. Let me just…</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: What’d you say?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I said – for the twentieth time – if a person
promises somebody something, they can’t just turn around and take it
back.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Oh, honey, Jesus. Don’t start with that
again.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Because I’m the mother, and I get to tell
you what to do every minute of your life ’til you’re eighteen.
Seriously, we’ve got no money. I can’t buy you the moccasins.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I bet if you’d promised Roy some moccasins
he’d of got ’em.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: No talk about Roy, okay? And ditto the
moccasins. We, can’t, afford, them.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Yeah, but you did promise…</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Sue me. Take me to court. Oh, Toby, I know
you’re disappointed, but…</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Jack. Call me Jack.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: You’re going to drive me to an early
grave: I’m never going to make Salt Lake City.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Seriously. If a person can’t get a stinking
miserable pair of moccasins, at least he ought to be able to choose his
own name… … and I wanna be called Jack!</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Fine. And you can call me… … Jeanette.
Jeanette Marie.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Oh, you’re so stupid sometimes,</p>
<p><strong>i…</strong>: The BAWLING of an AIRHORN interrupts him. Both
of them look through the back window and see a huge tractor- trailer
truck, out of control, bearing down on them. Caroline brakes and steers
a hard right, SKIDDING the NASH safely onto the side of the road. The
truck, its HORN BLASTING steadily, shimmies and slides past them, and
then, hideously, fails to make the next curve: it smashes through the
guard rails and into empty space, its HORN still BLARING. Caroline and
Toby look at each other, then scramble out of the car.</p>
<p><strong>3 ext. broken guard rail - day 3</strong>: Other drivers have
stopped to look: hundreds of feet below, the truck lies on its back
among boulders. Caroline glances, then turns away. She pulls Toby away,
one arm around his shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>4 ext. nash ambassador - minutes later 4</strong>: Caroline
fills the Nash’s steaming radiator with a can of water.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Goddamn thing.</p>
<p><strong>4 continued: 4</strong>: She glances back to where a larger
crowd of people stare avidly down at the truck. She bites her lip.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Oh, that poor man.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I hope to hell this isn’t some kind of
omen.</p>
<p><strong>5 int. nash ambassador - night 5</strong>: Toby and Caroline
sing “Mood Indigo” together. Toby holds a complicated-looking, black
con- traption which looks something like an antique flashlight.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: How’s this thing work, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: It makes a black light that, uh, causes
uranium traces to glow.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: And we just walk along the street and find
this glowing uranium?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Well, it was everywhere in Moab, they say
– just like gold in the gold-rush days.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: But we were too late in Moab, and that guy at
the office said nobody’d found any uranium in Salt Lake City.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Well, that means we’ll have the place
pretty much to ourselves, huh? Honey, this could be a big break for us.
If this works out, oh, just think: we’ll get us a house, get rid of this
damn Nash Ambassador – no money worries… It’ll be like heaven on a June
day.</p>
<p><strong>6 int. car - dawn 6</strong>: We hear “MOOD INDIGO” on the
car RADIO and see that a weary Caroline has driven through the night and
Toby is slumped against the passenger door. Toby stirs, then opens his
eyes.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Ask me how far we are from Salt Lake
City.</p>
<p><strong>caroline/toby</strong>: Forty-seven miles to go!</p>
<p><strong>7 ext. highway - morning 7</strong>: Well, hell. The Nash
Ambassador sits by the side of the road, its hood up, its radiator
steaming. Caroline and Toby sit in a patch of shade by the car.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: If I could have one wish right now – only
one wish – you know what I’d like? I’d like to burn this damn Nash
Ambassador to a crisp. I’m serious. I hate it. I hate the factory that
produced it, and I hate the man who invented it.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: It almost makes me want to see Roy – he was
the only one could make the thing stop overheating. My God, he was
boring. Boring and mean: you sure got crappy taste in boyfriends.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: I’d like to burn you to the ground. Let’s
go get rich in Salt Lake City!</p>
<p><strong>8 ext. salt lake city - day 8</strong>: Toby waits beside the
Nash Ambassador, looking toward a three-story concrete building. He
holds a portable RADIO, which PLAYS DEAN MARTIN singing “Volare.”</p>
<p><strong>9 int. building - parallel time 9</strong>: Caroline, holding
the imitation Geiger counter, stands across the counter from a MAN who
is looking at her very strangely.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: You’re pulling my leg, right?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: No, I came here to look for uranium.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: My God, lady. If you’re looking for uranium,
why didn’t you go to Moab?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: We went there, but everybody’d beaten us
there. We were too late.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: So you came here just on the chance you’d find
uranium? Listen, you mind me saying something to you might sound rude?
Lady, you got more courage than you got common sense.</p>
<p><strong>10 ext. nash ambassador - day 10</strong>: Caroline exits the
building, dumps the Geiger counter in a trash can and strides to the
car. She gets in, and says two words:</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Don’t ask.</p>
<p><strong>11 int. nash ambassador - day 11</strong>: Caroline turns the
key in the ignition and gets only a maddening RER-RER-RER-RER noise from
the ENGINE: wearily, she rests her forehead on the steering wheel.</p>
<p><strong>12 ext. nash ambassador - twenty minutes later 12</strong>:
Caroline and Toby have the hood up and are peering into the engine.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: That mechanic in Colorado said it needed
points.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: I know. Don’t tell me what I already know.
This thing’s a bottomless pit. I don’t know what to do. No matter how
much money I pour into it…</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: I’d rather be whipped with a belt than have
car trouble. ’Course these days I don’t have to worry about that. My
husband got laid off at the mill, and they repossessed the car, so
wherever I wanna go, I just have to hoof it, you know?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: You don’t have a car? You want this
one?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: I… uh… I…</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: You’re gonna give our car away?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Seriously. It needs points, and it
overheats constantly, but you can have it if you want it, because my
hand to God, I can’t look at it one more minute.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Well, sure…</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Get the bags out. Get the owner’s slip out
of the glove compartment. We’re rid of this son-of-a-bitch pink and
white albatross. You don’t mind taking a car with a big dent in the
passenger door?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Hell, no. There’s no dent there…</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Oh, yes there is!</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: … you really just giving me this car?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: It’s done. It’s yours. You got yourself a
Nash Ambassador! Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>13 ext. city street - day 13</strong>: 1957 is all around us:
gas is 29.9 cents a gallon; bread is 19 cents a loaf; cars are curved
and heavily chromed; people occasionally nod and smile at strangers;
children carry hula hoops. In all, a gentler time. Caroline and Toby
stride along briskly, as if they knew where they were going.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: … find ourselves a cheap room someplace,
we’ll get you into school, I’ll brush up on my typing and get a job, and
things’ll start looking up. I feel it: the good times are coming. And at
least we’re rid of that damn Nash Ambassador!</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Yeah, and like Dad used to say, ‘We may be
broke, but we’re never poor.’ And later, if we get a house with a big
yard, I could get a collie, you know? One like Lad or Grey Dawn. And
someday maybe a palomino. And I’m going to try harder in school,
too…</p>
<p><strong>vice principal</strong>: … like to give new boys the benefit
of the doubt, but this is the second time in two weeks that you’ve been
in front of me, and I don’t like that. Now I think you better just call
your mother and tell her to come down here.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: She works. She’s working.</p>
<p><strong>15 ext. school - afternoon 15</strong>: Caroline and Toby
exit. Toby sullen; Caroline angry.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: It wasn’t me broke their stupid windows.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Liar.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Gee, thanks a lot, Mom – believe them instead
of me.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: If you care anything about me at all,
you’ll shut up.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Yeah, well if you’d stayed married to Dad none
of this would’ve ever happened.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Look, don’t you put that on my back: I
can’t make your father call you. I can’t make your brother write you.
They dumped you. Yes. But it’s not my fault.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: My head is killing me.</p>
<p><strong>16a same scene - dusk 16a</strong>: Caroline wakes up with a
start, then sees Toby sitting in a chair, watching her.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Seven. Almost.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Why didn’t you wake me?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I started dinner. The potatoes are frying, and
I’m heating up the hot dogs.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Hold your mother’s hand.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: I know you are, honey. Ah, well – it
wasn’t fire, and nobody bled, so I guess we’re okay.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Yes… Yes… Yes, I know… You’re right… All
right, yes… in an hour, then.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Who was that?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Who was that?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: We’ve got a guest for dinner: it’s Roy. He
tracked us down.</p>
<p><strong>17 int. caroline and toby’s kitchen - one hour later
17</strong>: Caroline, Toby and ROY are eating at the tiny table. Roy is
good-looking in a meaty, hairy-chested sort of way. Though he is on his
very best behavior just now, there is a mean streak in him. Toby,
delighted, holds a Winchester .22 rifle across his lap – a peace-making
gift from Roy.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: … I found me a room, but it’s clear the hell
and gone ‘cross town. And I think I got a job lined up doin’ tune-ups in
a Texaco station. How you like it at Winstead’s?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: How do you know where I work?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: I been here almost a week.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: You followed me around? For a week?
Watching?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: And how did you ever find me?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: You like the rifle, Toby? ‘Jack,’ I mean.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: It’s the best present I ever got. I just love
it. I’m going to pretend I’m shooting.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Don’t point that thing at anybody or I
won’t teach you to shoot.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: It’s not loaded!</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: You heard me: anybody or any thing.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: It’s got no bullets, for God’s sake.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Don’t make me speak to you again.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I’ll point it at the sky, then.</p>
<p><strong>18 int. living room - two hours later 18</strong>: Caroline
and Roy are kissing on the sofa, and he is all over her: his hands are
on her breasts, her thighs, everywhere. Aroused in spite of herself,
Caroline pulls away, indicating the light in the other room.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Don’t. Toby’s still up.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: You are one sweet thing, baby: just the sight
of you makes my dick hard.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Aw, he won’t hear anything.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Shit, baby, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean that. I’m
just so glad to see you.</p>
<p><strong>19 int. kitchen - parallel time 19</strong>: Dressed for bed,
Toby stands by an open window. He can hear every WORD of ROY’S, who
continues to apologize between kisses. The room is illuminated by a
nearby streetlamp. The frosty air from the open window causes his breath
to steam. He raises two fingers to his lips, pretends to take a drag on
a cigarette and blows out the steam from his breath. The VOICES in the
other room grow a bit LOUDER, almost to an argument, and then SUBSIDE
again. Toby takes another drag from his pretend cig- arette. He looks
very young.</p>
<p><strong>20 ext. residential street - afternoon 20</strong>: Toby
wanders toward the rooming house. He stops to watch TWO fiftyish WOMEN
who are working in a garden. One Woman looks up.</p>
<p><strong>woman #1</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>woman #1</strong>: My Lord, look at the eyes on him – won’t
he be a heartbreaker in three, four years?</p>
<p><strong>woman #2</strong>: Bedroom eyes.</p>
<p><strong>woman #1</strong>: You live in the neighborhood, sweetie?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Over there. I won’t be here long, though,
’cause my dad’s coming to get me.</p>
<p><strong>woman #1</strong>: Oh, yes?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Yeah. I’m gonna live on his ranch in Phoenix.
The “Lazy B,” it’s called.</p>
<p><strong>woman #2</strong>: That sounds like fun.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: It is. I’ve got a palomino horse and a collie,
and Dad lets us go on hunts all by ourselves. He gave me this Winchester
.22, and last year I shot a mountain lion with it. And Lad – that’s my
dog – found a nest of rattlesnakes one time, and killed all twelve of
them…</p>
<p><strong>21 int. caroline and toby’s rooms - afternoon 21</strong>:
Toby enters. Four packed suitcases lie on the bed behind Caroline.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: What’re you doing home so – We going
someplace?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: We sure are.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: I don’t know. Got any suggestions?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Phoenix.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Good. I was thinking of Phoenix or Seattle
– lots of opportunities in both those places.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: What about your fabulous boyfriends? What
about the fabulous, boring Roy? Is he coming, too?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Not if I can help it. I looked out the
window at work today, and he was parked across the street, watching.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Roy’s so uncool. So boring.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: You liked him well enough last night. ‘Oh,
Roy, I just love my rifle so much! It’s the bestest present ever!’</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Oh, shut up.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Now? We’re going now? What about all the
food?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Leave it.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Even the canned stuff?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Leave it!</p>
<p><strong>22 int. bus station - afternoon 22</strong>: Caroline and
Toby stand at a ticket counter, disappointed.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Well, ask him when the next one to Phoenix
is.</p>
<p><strong>ticket seller</strong>: Tomorrow morning, eleven
forty-five.</p>
<p><strong>22 continued: 22</strong>: Toby and Caroline groan, then
Caroline brightens.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: What about Seattle?</p>
<p><strong>ticket seller</strong>: Leaves in nine minutes.</p>
<p><strong>23 ext. boarding area 23</strong>: Toby and Caroline hurry
onboard a Greyhound bus with Seattle as its destination.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: … I’ve always had a good head for figures,
and if I could get my C.P.A. license, I believe we could make a real go
of it in Seattle. I’ll advertise for roommates, and I bet we find us a
real cute house to rent.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: If there’s a big yard, can I get a collie?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Sure. Oh, honey, I feel a wind at my back:
I think this is going to work out good.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Yeah – like heaven on a June day.</p>
<p><strong>24 ext. tract house - afternoon 24</strong>: The house is a
nasty little thing with peeling paint. From inside we hear:</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: … and if you cut school again I’ll just
wear you out – do you hear me? I’m tired of it!</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Yeah, yeah…</p>
<p><strong>24a ext. tract house/further down street - afternoon
24a</strong>: From one of the houses TERRY TAYLOR emerges, falling into
step with Toby. He’s Toby’s age, and is almost an exact replica of
him.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Hey, Terry.</p>
<p><strong>terry taylor</strong>: Hey, Jack. What’d your mom say about
skipping school today?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Who listens?</p>
<p><strong>terry taylor</strong>: You go over to Wanda’s house last
night? You make out good? How good?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I fucked her ’til her nose bled.</p>
<p><strong>terry taylor</strong>: Sure you did! Oh, Wolff, you’re
rich.</p>
<p><strong>25 int. apartment - afternoon 25</strong>: TERRY SILVER opens
the door to admit Toby and Terry Taylor. Silver is a clone of both Toby
and Terry Taylor.</p>
<p><strong>26 int. living room - afternoon 26</strong>: As the three
boys troop through the room, they pass Terry Silver’s two SISTERS, who
are sprawled sensually on a sofa.</p>
<p><strong>sister #1</strong>: Oh look – it’s Elvis, Elvis, and
Elvis.</p>
<p><strong>terry taylor</strong>: Excuse me, but does your face hurt?
’Cause it’s killing me.</p>
<p><strong>27 int. tv room - afternoon 27</strong>: The boys light up
three cigarettes , then throw themselves onto the floor in front of a
black-and-white TV. Superman is ON. When Lois Lane comes on, Terry
Taylor starts moaning as if sexually aroused; Terry Silver jumps to his
knees and licks the TV screen repeatedly, also moaning. Toby closes his
eyes, also as if in sexual transport.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Oh, Lois. Oh, baby, come here – I got six hot
inches just waiting for you.</p>
<p><strong>terry taylor</strong>: Man, look at her! Look at that
body-y-y-y.</p>
<p><strong>terry silver</strong>: Um-m-m-m. M-M-M. Oh, Annette, I want
you. I want you so bad.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Oh, babybabybabybabybaby… You make my dick
hard!</p>
<p><strong>three of them</strong>: Yum, yum, yum.</p>
<p><strong>27 continued: 27</strong>: Making wet kissing noises, or just
rocking their heads back and forth as if tempted beyond endurance. Then,
slowly, they shut up and lie back down.</p>
<p><strong>27a same scene - later 27a</strong>: And this is what they
really wanted: absolutely silent, all three boys stare fixedly at the
screen. They are totally absorbed, caught up in the sweetness and warmth
of the show. Not one of these boys has ever touched a girl’s breast; all
three are at least two years from their first shave; all three are
pre-pubescent, and their sexuality is all bravado – now we see them for
what they are: three skinny-armed 13-year-olds, fascinated by
Superman.</p>
<p><strong>28 int. toby and caroline’s kitchen - dusk 28</strong>:
Caroline pirouettes for her two roommates, KATHY, a diffident,
sweet-faced young woman, and MARIAN, a heavyset, loud, red-faced woman
who eats compulsively from a package of oatmeal cookies. Both of the
women ooh and aah over Caroline’s dress.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: That belt just makes it.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: It does pick up the green, doesn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: And you say he’s getting serious
already?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Yes, I think. He keeps talking about
marriage, keeps saying he wants to meet Toby.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Well, that’s it – three dates and you got
’im good.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: I don’t know if I want him –</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Don’t want who?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Little pitchers…</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Well, it’s the tough guy who can’t be
bothered to go to school.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Oh, it’s nothing – we were talking about
Dwight. I told you about Dwight.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: He the one drives down from the boondocks? The
mechanic? Dwight. What a stupid name. Dwiiiight. Duhhhhwight.
Dwight-tah-h-h-h. Dwighttahhhhh.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Would you like coffee before we go? Or a
Coke?</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: You know, I believe I could stand a cup of
java.</p>
<p><strong>28 continued: 28</strong>: As Caroline pours the coffee,
Dwight turns to Toby.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: So you’re Toby.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: You’re not Toby?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Oh, he wants to be called ‘Jack.’ It’s so
silly… ever since he read Jack London.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Well, I’ll call him anything he wants. I
always say people can call me anything they want, long as they don’t
call me late for supper!</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: So, Jack, you like school?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: He might like it if he ever went there and
tried it.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Oh, have another cookie, Marian – keep your
strength up.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: I’d like to just yank that nasty tongue of
yours out by the roots.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: My son’s decided to try to drive me into
an early grave. Truly.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: You straighten up and be polite, you hear
me?</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Who made this?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: I did…</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Well, well, well, all I can say is that you
people are pretty lucky to live in a house where – oh.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: I hear you’re invited up to Dwight’s next
week for Thanksgiving.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Aw, you’ll love it. Great air, great water.
For scenery, all you have to do is step outside your front door and open
your eyes. And there’s a turkey shoot Thanksgiving Day. Your mom said
you might like it, so I signed you up.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Really? I can shoot my Winchester? Great! I
bet I could be the one to get the turkey.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Well, amazing: it can sit up and talk like
a normal human being. Dwight, we’re going to be late.</p>
<p><strong>toby marian kathy</strong>: What a geek. I love a man knows
He’s so appealing.</p>
<p><strong>29 ext. residential street - afternoon 29</strong>: We hear
SCREAMING. Toby and Terry Taylor race BY the CAMERA on stolen tricycles,
yelling as if they’re attack- ing Indians. Behind them comes Terry
Silver, on foot. Atop a small hill, both boys jump off, letting the
TRICYCLES SMASH into a parked car. Then they run like hell with Terry
Silver bringing up the rear.</p>
<p><strong>30 int. caroline and toby’s living room - morning
30</strong>: Caroline is dressed casually. Toby has on a shirt and
sweater. He is pretending that he’s buck-toothed. Caroline finishes
packing a small suitcase.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: I want you to be polite to Dwight this
weekend.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: I mean it, now.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I said ‘Okay,’ didn’t I?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Hey, c’mon, maybe the weekend’ll be fun…
maybe Concrete will be pretty.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Oh, Concrete, my favorite town. Welcome to
beautiful Concrete!</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: And stop that.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Stop what?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Sometimes I could kill you as free as I
could eat a bite.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Ditto.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Please be nice.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>31 ext. road - morning 31</strong>: We see Dwight driving his
shiny Buick, Caroline and Toby beside him. As the CAMERA TRACKS the car
with VARIOUS SHOTS, we hear:</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: … air like wine at my place, and I don’t
mind saying I wouldn’t live anywhere else, and that’s the God’s honest
truth. There’s good schools, honest people, and some of the best fishing
in the world. Ted Williams – you like baseball, Toby? That is, Jack, I
mean – you like baseball? ’Cause Ted Williams, whom I believe is one of
the all-time greats, is also a world-class angler. Many’s the day he and
I’ve talked over the best way to get a fish to say yes to a hook.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Hunting, too: there’s game everywhere you
look. I don’t think I flatter myself by saying that I’m something of a
whiz with a rifle, and Concrete gives me every opportunity to prove
it…</p>
<p><strong>32 ext. small bridge - day 32</strong>: The three stand by
the edge of the bridge, looking down into the water.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: They always show you salmon fighting to get
upstream, but they never show you what they look like when they get
there.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: It’s pitiful. Awful.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: They’ll spawn, and then they’ll die. They’re
dying now.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I hope to hell it’s not an omen.</p>
<p><strong>a33 ext. concrete silo - day a33</strong>: The Buick drives
into town past an enormous disused Concrete silo where “Welcome To
Concrete” is painted in huge faded letters.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: So here we go. Welcome to Concrete. Dwight’s
home sweet home. Finest people in the whole state of Washington, you ask
me. Lots of churches, too. A neighbor of mine says, “Looking for nice
churches, come to Concrete. Looking for sin, go to hell.” I think that’s
funny…</p>
<p><strong>33 ext. dwight’s house - day 33</strong>: Dwight’s Buick
pulls to a stop; Dwight, Caroline, and Toby get out. The scenery is as
beautiful as Dwight said it was.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: All the houses are converted Army barracks,
made into duplexes –</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Well. Let’s see here. Kids, this is my
pretty friend, Caroline Wolff, and her boy To…</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Jack Wolff. These are my kids: Skipper,
Norma and my baby, Pearl.</p>
<p><strong>34 int. dwight’s living room - day 34</strong>: They enter
and look around: well, it’s not awful, but it sure as hell isn’t
wonderful. The room is dark, on the small side, and shows the lack of a
woman’s hand. Caroline looks a bit taken aback, but tries to hide it by
saying the word “nice” over and over. The CAMERA FOLLOWS them FROM room
TO room:</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Okay, so that was the living room; over here
is the kitchen – I plan on getting all new fixtures in here – and down
that hall are the three bedrooms and the bath.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: This is sort of a lounging area. You know,
just in case you want to…</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: … lounge.</p>
<p><strong>35 ext. business street - day 35</strong>: The business area
is small and rather forlorn. The six of them walk in pairs – Dwight and
Caroline, Skipper and Norma, and last, Toby and Pearl.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: And over there’s where I work.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: How about you guys? You like it here?</p>
<p><strong>skipper norma</strong>: Fine. Yeah, it’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: It’s a little isolated, is all.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Not that isolated.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Well, maybe not that isolated. Pretty
isolated, though.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Aw, there’s plenty to do in Concrete if you
kids would take a little initiative. When I was growing up we didn’t
have T.V. – we used our imaginations. We read the classics. We played
musical instruments. You show me a bored kid, I’ll show you a lazy
kid.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: I didn’t know you played an instrument,
Dwight. What do you play?</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Sax. Tenor sax.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: How’s the school here?</p>
<p><strong>skipper</strong>: There isn’t one. We go to Chinook.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Chinook High.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: It’s a few miles downriver.</p>
<p><strong>skipper</strong>: Forty miles.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Come off it – it’s not that far.</p>
<p><strong>skipper</strong>: Yeah, I clocked it: thirty-nine miles.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Ah, you’d bellyache if the goddam school was
in your fugging back yard. Just shut your god- damn pie-hole.</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: I’m in fifth grade.</p>
<p><strong>36 int. dwight’s living room - hour later 36</strong>: Dwight
has recovered his good mood. Dressed in a marksman’s coat with a padded
shoulder, Dwight is laughing as he attempts to assemble Toby’s
Winchester .22.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: ‘Turkey shoot’ is just a figure of
speech.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: There’s no real turkey?</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: No, it’s just regulation paper targets. It’s
a test of skill. And, Jack, I just found out yesterday that they won’t
let kids shoot.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: But you said I could!</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: I know, but they got it all screwed up
somehow and told me wrong at first.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Dwight, you did tell him.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: I don’t make the rules, Caroline. If I made
the rules, I might make different ones, but I don’t make the rules.</p>
<p><strong>37 ext. open field - day 37</strong>: A sullen Toby stands
with Pearl. Dwight is giving his name and the entry fee to a MAN. As the
Man moves away, Caroline stops him and holds out some money.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Wolff. Caroline Wolff.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: You mean you want to enter? I think it’s
against the rules.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Well, that sign says this is an N.R.A.
club, and I’m a dues-paying N.R.A. member. That gives me the right to
participate in the activities of other chapters.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: You’ll be the only woman shooting.</p>
<p><strong>same scene - later</strong>: Dwight looks stunned, and Toby
is almost equally surprised.</p>
<p><strong>38 continued: 38</strong>: On the scoreboard, we see that
Caroline is in second place and by only two shots. As the next-to-last
round finishes, Caroline is surrounded by a few people who are
complimenting her shooting. Dwight’s smile is even bigger: Oh, he wanted
to be the one to win. The last round starts. A MAN, evidently the one in
first place, heads to the shooting alley for his turn. As he passes
Caroline, trying to rattle her, he speaks confidently.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: That second-place trophy ain’t bad, honey.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Then you won’t feel too bad about carrying
it home, will you?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: That was for you, honey.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I didn’t know you were a member of the
N.R.A.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: I’m a little behind in my dues –
Thirty-six years behind.</p>
<p><strong>39 int. dwight’s kitchen - day 39</strong>: Caroline, Toby
and Pearl enter. Norma is cooking Thanksgiving dinner. Dwight WALKS
HEAVILY down the hall to his bedroom and SLAMS the DOOR.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: What gives?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Mom won the turkey shoot.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Oh, boy. Now we’re in for it – he thinks he’s
some kind of big hunter.</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: Well, he killed a deer once.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: That was with the car.</p>
<p><strong>40 int. dining room - afternoon 40</strong>: Though there are
some occasional sentences like “Could I have the potatoes, please?” or
“This dressing is really delicious,” mostly there is just silence and
the noise of SILVERWARE ON PLATES. Dwight is working hard on the
wine.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: I got just one thing to say. I’m sitting at
the table with the best damn shot in the county!</p>
<p><strong>41 int. dwight’s living room - night 41</strong>: Norma plays
“Blue Monday” on an upright piano whilst Toby sings it. After finishing
the song, Norma launches into “On Moonlight Bay.” Everybody joins
in.</p>
<p><strong>41 continued: 41</strong>: Toby and Caroline glance at each
other and smile.</p>
<p><strong>41a same scene - middle of night 41a</strong>: Caroline, who
is sleeping on the sofa bed, returns from the bathroom. She sees that
Toby’s awake on his pallet on the floor. She sits on the floor beside
him.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: So what do you think?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: They’re okay. What’s that bald spot on Pearl’s
head? Ugh.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Some sort of infection.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Norma’s nice.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: They’re all nice, but Dwight keeps rushing
me, keeps talking about marriage. And I don’t really want to get married
– not now anyway.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: That’s fine with me. I wish you would’ve
stayed married to Dad.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Oh, don’t wish Duke back on me. God.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: That woman he married? Is she really rich?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Like King Midas. Okay, look, we’ll go back
to Seattle and see how things go. I’ve been thinking about taking a
course in stenotyping. A court reporter’s pay is real high. Kathy got
engaged, so either I find us another roommate or I’ve got to make some
more money. And this stenotyping thing sounds just right. This could
turn out good, honey.</p>
<p><strong>42 int. boys’ bathroom at school - day 42</strong>: Toby,
Terry Silver and Terry Taylor lounge against the wall, smoking.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I mean I blew it off, man – I blew his fuckin’
turkey’s head off.</p>
<p><strong>terry taylor</strong>: With a .22.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Fuckin’ A. Winchester .22. Pump.</p>
<p><strong>terry taylor</strong>: Wolff, you are so full of shit.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Don’t believe me – see if I care.</p>
<p><strong>terry taylor</strong>: All a .22 bullet would do is make a
hole in his head.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: One bullet, maybe.</p>
<p><strong>terry taylor</strong>: Oh. Oh, I see – you hit the turkey
more than once. While he was flying. In the head.</p>
<p><strong>43 ext. residential street - afternoon 43</strong>: Toby
stands at the top of a small hill with Terry Silver and Terry Taylor.
They are too casual, their faces too innocent: something’s up. They wait
until a middle-aged man raking leaves turns and disappears around a
corner. Then the three of them open the door of a car, take off the
emergency brake, and start it rolling down the hill.</p>
<p><strong>43 continued: 43</strong>: The car rolls silently down the
hill. It CRASHES into another car at the bottom, making a LOUD NOISE.
The three boys run like the wind out of sight.</p>
<p><strong>44 int. caroline and toby’s kitchen - night 44</strong>:
Caroline, Toby, Marian and Kathy sit at the table eating dinner.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: … exactly what I wanted for my dress. It’s a
Simplicity pattern, and I’m pretty sure I can make it myself. It’s got
big puff sleeves…</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>45 int. principal’s office - day 45</strong>: The principal,
MR. SHIPPY, sits behind his desk. Toby, looking scared, sits across from
him. A secretary lets Caroline into the room. Mr. Shippy rises and
introduces himself. Caroline doesn’t respond to the introduction.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: What did he do?</p>
<p><strong>mr. shippy</strong>: He violated the school property and
flouted the law.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Can you say that in English?</p>
<p><strong>mr. shippy</strong>: He wrote obscene words on the wall.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Did you do it? He didn’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>mr. shippy</strong>: He wrote obscene words on the wall.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: What obscene words?</p>
<p><strong>mr. shippy</strong>: ‘Fuck you.’</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: That’s one obscene word.</p>
<p><strong>mr. shippy</strong>: Look, Mrs. Wolff, Jack’s teachers, like
him but they think he’s fallen in with the wrong kind of friends. Is
that nicotine stain on your fingers? I hope not. Let me tell you a
story: I started smoking in college. Two packs a day. I ate ‘em. One
night I went to have a cigarette and lo and behold, the pack was empty.
I went downstairs and started to rummage through the garbage cans. But
as I reached down – I mean, right down into a garbage can – I suddenly
thought, ’Whoa. Hold on right there, Buster.’ I went back to my room and
to this day I haven’t smoked another cigarette.</p>
<p><strong>mr. shippy</strong>: After that, every day I saved the exact
amount of money I would’ve spent on cigarettes. In three years, I put it
all together, and you know what I bought? I bought myself… … a Nash
Ambassador.</p>
<p><strong>mr. shippy</strong>: Well, back to the point: I think two
weeks’ suspension.</p>
<p><strong>46 int. caroline and toby’s house - same day 46</strong>:
Caroline and Toby enter the house. Caroline goes into the bedroom, shuts
the door. Toby sits on the couch.</p>
<p><strong>46a same scene - night 46a</strong>: Late afternoon sun
slants through the venetian blinds. Toby sits exactly as he sat before.
Then Caroline comes out of the bedroom, ominously calm. She sits
down.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: So what shall we do?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Ever since Duke and I got divorced, you’re
a different boy. I know he never calls you and I could kill him for it –
but that’s how Duke is. And Gregory’s in Princeton now, so I guess… So
what shall we do? Because this isn’t working. We barely have enough
money, Kathy’s moving out, and on top of it all, you’ve gone wild. You
lie…</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: No I don’…</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Yes, you do. You steal from Marian’s purse
– I just can’t handle you anymore, and it scares me. I don’t know what
to do. So, you tell me what to do.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I can be better. I will be. And I hate the way
I am anymore! I don’t know why I do it! What about that stenotyping
thing you were gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: It won’t happen. It won’t happen. It won’t
happen. Things aren’t going to turn out well, things aren’t going to
start looking up, and it’s never going to be like heaven on a June day.
There is no uranium. There is no stenotyping. There is no C.P.A.
license. There isn’t…</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: … I talked to Dwight: after Christmas, he
wants you to come up to Concrete and live with him for a few months – go
to school there.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: What are you going to do, just give me away to
him?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: If you two can get along, if it works out,
then I guess he and I might get married.</p>
<p><strong>46a continued: 46a</strong>: The two stare at each other.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: I can’t think of anything else to do. But
first I want your approval.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>47 int. caroline’s living room - day 47</strong>: Christmas
is over: a few scattered pieces of wrapping paper lie scattered on the
floor, and a small Christmas tree with bubble-lights glows in a corner.
Caroline shuts a suitcase and looks at Toby.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: I put in both your sweaters. You wear them
now, the nights are so chilly up there.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Okay. I will.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: You don’t have to go if you don’t want to,
honey.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: No, it’s okay. I’ll go.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Here I am, you lucky people!</p>
<p><strong>48 ext. caroline and toby’s house - dusk 48</strong>: Dwights
hustles the bags into the trunk, tells Toby to kiss his mother, and hops
into the car, all smiles, all cheeriness. The Buick pulls away, leaving
Caroline white-faced and miserable.</p>
<p><strong>49 int. buick - night 49</strong>: Dwight takes a pull from a
pint bottle of whiskey and gives Toby a sneering, contemptuous look.
Toby reaches over, SNAPS ON the RADIO. Immediately Dwight SNAPS IT off.
Then, in the headlight’s glare, Toby sees a dark shape.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Hey, look: is that a raccoon or a beaver.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Go get it – the pelt’s worth fifty bucks,
minimum.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: That thing’s probably got rabies…</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Get it!</p>
<p><strong>50 ext. road - night 50</strong>: Toby moves to where the
dead beaver lies on its back, its eyes open, in the red glow of the
taillights. Toby picks the thing up and lugs it back toward Dwight, who
has the trunk open.</p>
<p><strong>51 int. buick - night 51</strong>: Dwight is still drinking,
between swallows, he gives Toby sneering glances. Dwight is driving very
fast. The road begins a series of curves. Dwight doesn’t slow down, and
the TIRES begin to SCREAM on the curves. The road runs along a steep
gorge. Dwight increases the speed, and the car begins to fishtail.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I’m a little sick to my stomach.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Sick to your stomach? A hotshot like
you?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I’m not a hotshot.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: That’s what I hear. I hear you’re a real
hotshot. Come and go where you please, do what you please. Isn’t that
right? Yeah, regular man about town. Performer, too. That right, Jack?
You a performer?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: That’s a goddamned lie.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: If there’s one thing I can’t stomach, it’s a
liar.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I’m not a liar.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Sure you are. You or Marian. Is Marian a
liar? She says you’re quite the little performer. Is that a lie? You
tell me that’s a lie and we’ll drive back to Seattle so you can call her
a liar to her face. You want me to do that?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Then you must be the one’s a liar, right?
And you’re a performer?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I guess.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: You guess? You guess? Let’s see your act. Go
on. Do your act. I’m waiting.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Sure you can.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Do me. I hear you do me.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Yeah, I hear you’re good at doing me. Here.
Do me with the lighter. Go on. Take it.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Hotshot. You pull that hotshot stuff around
me and I’ll break every bone in your body. You understand me? You’re in
for a change, mister. You got that? Huh? You got that good? You’re in
for a whole ’nother ballgame.</p>
<p><strong>52 ext. dwight’s house - night 52</strong>: Dwight’s Buick
pulls to a stop as Norma, Skipper and Pearl come out to meet them.
Dwight is calmer now.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Skipper, go get that washtub out back, and
Pearl, bring the hose around and fill it up. Hotshot and me hit a
beaver. We’ll salt him down.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: I know you think you’re better than me.
Caroline told me all about your rich daddy and your prep-school brother,
but your fancy days are over: you’re a Concrete boy now. I’m gonna give
you a big injection of Concrete. That’s right – inoculate you. Oh, my,
yes. You’re gonna find out that in Concrete we have to be able to do
more than sing Fats Domino songs, we work…</p>
<p><strong>53 int. dwight’s kitchen - same night 53</strong>: Dwight,
Toby, Norma, Skipper and Pearl are eating dinner at the kitchen table.
Norma speaks to Toby.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: You’ll be in Miss Graham’s class?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Yeah, is she nice?</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: She’s okay. She’s pretty.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I hate changing schools.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Speaking of changing, I had a talk with Jack
on the way up here, and he says he wants to be a better boy. And that’s
good, ’cause things weren’t going well for him in Seattle: the police
actually came to his house to talk to Caroline about him. Uh-huh, the
police.</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: Criminal.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: So here’s what I think: I think idle hands
are the devil’s workshop, and so I found our Jack a little something to
do. I picked up two barrels of horse- chestnuts in the park. You can
spend your evenings hulling ’em. And I enrolled you in the Boy Scouts,
and you’ve got a paper route, starting Monday, every afternoon from
three to six-thirty – pays fifty-five bucks a month. What d’you say?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I’ll do it. I want to be… better.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: That’s what I like to hear. Okay, you guys
get these dishes cleaned up. Let’s show Jack how we do it in
Concrete.</p>
<p><strong>54 int. school room - day 54</strong>: MISS GRAHAM stands in
front of the class. Toby is midway back in the room.</p>
<p><strong>miss graham</strong>: ‘Of course I prayed – and did God care?
He cared as much as on the air a bird had stamped her foot and cried,
“Give me”.’ Now. What is the tone of this short poem?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Is it religious?</p>
<p><strong>miss graham</strong>: No – even though it talks about God, I
wouldn’t say it was religious.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: It’s sad.</p>
<p><strong>miss graham</strong>: Well, closer, maybe. But no.</p>
<p><strong>miss graham</strong>: Jack?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: It’s angry, sort of bitter.</p>
<p><strong>miss graham</strong>: Very good, Jack. Bull’s-eye.</p>
<p><strong>55 int. skipper and toby’s bedroom - night 55</strong>: The
room is dark. Skipper is asleep. Toby lies in a cot. Dwight leans
against the wall near the head of Toby’s bed. He speaks in a low,
reasonable voice:</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: … ‘cause I don’t believe that crap, you
know? I believe there is such a thing as a bad boy – bad clear through.
And it’s gonna be my job to turn you around, to kill or cure. Kill. Or.
Cure. Understand? And I’m up to the job, oh yes, believe me, hotshot, I
am ready, willing and able to take you on – you and that jibagoo music
you like to sing. I’m just the guy to knock that music out of your head
and put in some respect and obedience. Now your mother has just about
washed her hands of you – that’s obvious, ’cause she’s shipped you off
up here. I mean, she has had it with you. She told me: she said ’Dwight,
I just can’t handle him anymore.’ So don’t go crying to Mama, ’cause
Mama won’t listen. Mama is sick to death of her baby boy.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: And your rich Daddy Warbucks and your
Princeton brother don’t give a shit about you, ’cause Caroline told me
they haven’t even written in over two years. So it looks like I’m all
you got now – it’s just you and me. Feels sort of inevitable, doesn’t
it, hotshot? It’s like we were fated for each other, like I’m the one
guy on Earth could set you straight. And don’t you ever think I won’t
enjoy doing it, ’cause…</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Dear Toby, I sure do miss you, honey – the
house is like a tomb since you left. So quiet. My only entertainment
tonight was watching Marian eat a whole pint of ice cream. I hope you’re
liking it up in Concrete. I just know you’ll try hard in school and be
good and mind Dwight. I worry about you so much, and I hope this will be
just what you need.</p>
<p><strong>55 continued: 55</strong>: Again see Toby delivering his
papers. 55</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Dear Mom, Thanks for the birthday present. It
fit fine. You don’t have to worry so much. I’m okay here. The weather is
nice, and I like Scouts a lot. Dwight took us all to see Bridge on the
River Kwai. I liked it. So things are all right with me, except for
stupid Pearl, who I hate. Don’t worry all the time…</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: You remind me of that boy in the fairy tale
who had to spend twenty years sifting sand to find a golden needle.
Remember that one?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Dear Toby, Just a note before going to
bed. Dwight tells me that the two of you are getting along like a house
afire. I’m so glad. I wanted this to work out for you. You left your
sock cap here. Do you need it…?</p>
<p><strong>55 continued: 55</strong>: Skipper is asleep in his bed.
Across the 55</p>
<p><strong>56 int. dwight’s living room - afternoon 56</strong>: Toby
and Pearl are playing a card game called “Slap- Jack.” Toby slaps a card
down hard, yelling “I win again!” and Pearl pouts.</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: That’s no fair. You make me sick. I don’t
know why you have to live here, anyway. Daddy says we should think of it
like you were a charity kid.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Wanna comb your hair, Pearl?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Probably you do, since you’ve got such pretty
hair. I know if I had hair as pretty as yours, Pearl, I’d comb it all
the time.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Open the hell up! I got us a treat!</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: We’re gonna have snowcream!</p>
<p><strong>57 int. dwight’s kitchen - later 57</strong>: Dwight, Toby,
Skipper, Norma, and Pearl are enjoying the snowcream.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: … heard there was a fresh snow this morning,
so I drove up to the mountains. I stopped in a field where it was all
clean. I was finished packing it up high when somebody said… This’s
private property, in case you’re interested. I turned around and there
was this woman… Yechh! Ugliest woman I ever saw – ugly as a madman’s ass
she was. And frowning on top of it.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Oh, Daddy!</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: She was!</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: You’re ugly as a madman’s ass.</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: No, you are.</p>
<p><strong>skipper</strong>: What’d you say to the ugly woman?</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: I didn’t say nothin’ – I ran.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: I’m gonna get you a Scout uniform, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: Can I join the Girl Scouts?</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: I’m getting one for me, too. Don’t believe
in doing anything halfway. If you’re serious about the Scouts… … then I
want you to do it right. We’ll do it right together.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: I got you a subscription to this. I’ll take
the price out of your paper route money.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Boy’s Life?</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: It’s the official Scout magazine. Tells
about what it means to be a Scout, what kind of boy you need to be, and,
oh, about merit badges and stuff like that.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: ‘Suggested good turns a Scout can do: assist a
foreign boy with some English grammar. Help put out a burning field.
Give water to a crippled dog.’ I could do those.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Hell, yes, you could. You’re a bright kid. I
want this Scout thing done right, okay?</p>
<p><strong>58 int. toby and skipper’s bedroom - afternoon 58</strong>:
Toby stands in front of a full-length mirror wearing a huge Scout
uniform that’s been unsuccessfully cut down for him.</p>
<p><strong>58 continued: 58</strong>: The shirt-sleeves have been
shortened but the shoulders extend two inches beyond the ends of his
shoulders. The pants legs have been cut off and hemmed but the crotch of
the trousers hangs down three inches too low, giving him a stumpy,
dwarfish look. Toby yells to someone O.S.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I’m not going.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: The hell you say.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I’m not. Cut down Skipper’s old stuff, and
he’s twice as big as me – I’m gonna stay home.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: You’re gonna shit and fall back in it –
that’s all you’re gonna do. Now get out here.</p>
<p><strong>59 int. dwight’s living room - afternoon 59</strong>: As
Pearl watches Dwight also stands in front of a mirror, adjusting his
hat. He is resplendent in a brand-new Scout uniform. Toby stalks into
the room. Pearl laughs loudly.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Shut your pie-hole. You look fine.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I look like an idiot.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: You act like an idiot, you look fine.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: You said you’d get me a new uniform.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: I said I’d try to get you a new uniform.
Beside, this one is new – new to you.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: But look at the sleeves and how it hangs down
between my legs!</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Oh piss and moan – all you can do is piss
and moan.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Yeah, piss and moan – I notice you’re all
jazzed up in new stuff.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: They didn’t have second-hand uniforms in my
size.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Oh, yeah, pull the other leg, it’s got bells
on it!</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: And what’re you gonna tell Caroline this
weekend? You gonna say you wouldn’t join the Scouts because… him didn’t
wike his widdle uniform?</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: ‘No boy given over to dissipation or
negativity can stand the gaff. He quickly tires and gives up. He is the
type who usually lacks courage at the crucial moment. He cannot take
punishment and come back smiling.’</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: All right, but this stinks.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Hotshot, you don’t know it yet, but me and
Concrete are in your blood. We’re going to make a man of you yet – and
in years to come you’ll thank me. You’ll remember me. Me and
Concrete.</p>
<p><strong>60 ext. caroline’s house - day 60</strong>: Dwight’s Buick
pulls up and Caroline bursts out the front door. She runs to the car and
hugs Toby.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Oh, I missed you!</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Me, too.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: You look good. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I’m okay. I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: I said to hell with the budget and bought
a roast. I made dumplings – God, what’s wrong with your hands?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: It’s just juice from some chestnuts – it’ll
wear off.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: I hope so. My, your hair’s short.</p>
<p><strong>61 int. caroline’s living room - day 61</strong>: Dwight,
Caroline and Marian are having a drink. Toby plays FATS DOMINO’S “Blue
Monday” on the RADIO, the</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Well, it’s done him a world of good to be up
there with you.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Oh, we have us some pretty good times. Don’t
we, Jack? Have us some good times?</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: We go to the Scouts together every week.
He’s got a good start already on merit badges…</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: … though he does concentrate too much on the
easy ones, like the one for dental hygiene… … and we had snowcream one
night, and, oh, just lots of stuff.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: How is it in Concrete?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: It’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: School?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: School’s school. My grades are okay.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: You haven’t been in any trouble? Good.
How’re you and Dwight?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: He made us all snowcream, like he said.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Stop that, honey.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Well, you’ve got your eyes out of focus.
Look at me. Now, are things all right?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: You swear? You act odd.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: No, I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Well, good. I’d feel awful if it hadn’t
worked out.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: I told Dwight I’d marry him. In two weeks.
I don’t know what else to do. I mean, he’s been helping me with the rent
since Kathy left. And you need a father. I think it’s the best thing all
the way around – what d’you think?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I think it’s the best thing.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: I think it’s the best thing, too.</p>
<p><strong>63 int. living room - day 63</strong>: Toby stops dead as he
sees Dwight and Caroline locked in a busy kiss. He stops dead and
shrinks back into the hallway, defeated.</p>
<p><strong>64 int. skipper and toby’s bedroom - night 64</strong>: Toby
is alone in the room in his Boy Scout shirt and hat in front of a
mirror. A copy of Boy’s Life magazine is open in front of him with
drawings of Indians performing sign language. Watching himself in the
mirror, Toby makes a sign.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Hungry.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Food.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Want.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Great mystery.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Father.</p>
<p><strong>a65 int. dwight’s living room - day a65</strong>: Tarpaulins
are everywhere. Toby stands surrounded by seven five-gallon cans of
paint. Carrying paintbrushes, Dwight enters, dressed in old clothes
singing “In The Still Of The Night.”</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Now that’s a song. Not all this Elvis
Presley shit. Elvis sings about like I do brain surgery.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: ‘… uh-huh-huh, my blue suede shoes.’</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Let’s get this place ready for Caroline.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: It’s so white.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: I got a good deal on this paint. It’ll
darken up when it dries.</p>
<p><strong>65 same scene - later 65</strong>: The walls and ceiling are
almost finished, but the paint has not darkened.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: What? I like it. It looks clean.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Yeah, but it makes everything else look so
dark.</p>
<p><strong>same scene - later 65</strong>: On the SOUNDTRACK, ELVIS
BLASTS OUT “Blue Suede Shoes.” Dwight and Toby paint the coffee table
and lamp base white.</p>
<p><strong>same scene - later 65</strong>: Dwight and Toby, working
faster, are painting the end tables white.</p>
<p><strong>int. dining room - later 65</strong>: The walls and ceiling
are white, Dwight and Toby are painting the dining table white.</p>
<p><strong>int. kitchen - late night 65</strong>: Dwight and Toby are
painting the cabinets and kitchen table white.</p>
<p><strong>int. living room - next morning 65</strong>: Everywhere we
look is white, the walls, ceiling, furniture – all of it. Only the old
Baldwin upright piano has escaped painting. Dwight eyes it
suspiciously.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Sort of stands out, doesn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Yeah, you could say that.</p>
<p><strong>same scene - later 65</strong>: They paint the Baldwin white.
Dwight hesitates, then starts to paint the foot pedals.</p>
<p><strong>same scene - later 65</strong>: Dwight’s face tells us that
something still doesn’t suit him. He glances at Toby, Toby nods, and
they converge on the piano.</p>
<p><strong>same scene - later 65</strong>: Very carefully, Dwight and
Toby finish painting the dark ivory keys to match the rest of the room.
ELVIS SCREAMS OUT the last line, “You can do anything, but stay off of
my blue suede shoes!”</p>
<p><strong>66 ext. dwight’s house - day 66</strong>: Skipper and Norma
are carrying Caroline’s suitcases into the house from Dwight’s Buick.
From inside the house we hear a WOMAN’S LAUGHTER.</p>
<p><strong>67 int. dwight’s living room - parallel time 67</strong>:
Caroline is trying to stifle her laughter, as she stares at the
wilderness of white. Dwight and Toby, Skipper, Norma, and Pearl all
stand watch.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Oh! Oh, I’m so sorry… don’t know what’s
the matter with me… you’re right… it does look clean…</p>
<p><strong>68 int. small church - morning 68</strong>: Dwight and
Caroline are being married. Caroline wears a pale blue suit, and Dwight
looks good in a navy single- breasted. Aside from Toby and Dwight’s
children, the only guests are Marian, Kathy, and three people we haven’t
seen before – friends of Dwight’s.</p>
<p><strong>69 int. dwight and caroline’s bedroom - late night
69</strong>: The bed is a rat’s nest of twisted sheets as Dwight and
Caroline make love. He takes his lips away from Caroline’s breast and
moves so that his head is at the bottom of the bed. Holding her foot up,
he kisses the instep, then runs his tongue over the same spot and then
down under the arch of her foot. A sexy scene.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: M-m-m. There’s not a straight line on you –
everything’s curved.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Oh, Dwight, not like that. Not this time –
not tonight.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: It’s good this way.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: But I want to see your face while we make
love.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Oh, no – I just don’t… uh… like that
way.</p>
<p><strong>69 continued: 69</strong>: Dwight continues to stroke
Caroline, his hands everywhere, but now she is unresponsive.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: You mean you don’t like to make love face
to face?</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: No, I don’t like it. I can’t handle it – I
don’t like to see the face.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: You mean ever?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: But that’s grotesque…</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Look, you can get it doggie-style or you can
get it laying on your side – those are your only choices. This is my
house, and I get to say. Wherever McGinty sits is the head of the table,
you know?</p>
<p><strong>70 int. kitchen - next morning 70</strong>: Toby is eating
toast at the kitchen table. Norma has made a big breakfast, and she
hurriedly pours the coffee when she hears Dwight and Caroline’s bedroom
DOOR OPEN.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Happy Wedding Breakfast!</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: So how’s the bride?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Don’t.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: The bride doesn’t want to chat?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Stop it.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Well, the bride is sure snotty this
morning.</p>
<p><strong>71 ext. residential neighborhood - afternoon 71</strong>:
Toby, his news bag slung over his shoulder, stands talking idly with two
boys from school, OSCAR BOOKER and JIMMY VOORHEES. One of them says,
“Uh-oh,” and jerks his head to indicate where Toby and the other boy
should look. They look in the direction indicated, and see Arthur Gayle
coming down the road toward them, followed by a small black dog called
Pepper. As the boys watch Arthur’s approach:</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: What’s his name again?</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: Arthur Gayle.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: What a homo.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: He sure walks like a girl.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: And runs like one and talks like one and
throws like one. Probably takes a pee like one too – just squats right
down.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: He smarted off to me the other day – told me I
was a bourgeois.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: What the frig’s a bourgeois?</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: Call him a sissy.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: Just see what he says.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Yeah, do it.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Oh, my, my – look at all that yellow: Didn’t
your mama teach you to wash your hands after you pee?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Oh, shut up.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Now that’s what I like – an insult with some
originality. Did you just make that up? Just now? So clever.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Why don’t you take a long walk off a short
pier?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: nearly close enough to smell Toby’s</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Well, at least I’m not a great big sissy!</p>
<p><strong>71 continued: 71</strong>: Without warning, Arthur swings a
fist at Toby, catching him on the ear. Arthur’s second blow hits him in
the back of the head. The fight is on. Arthur throws punches sidearm,
with lots of wrist action, but there are so many of them. Before Toby
can react, Arthur has hit him four times, including one wild haymaker
that puts Toby on his knees. While Toby’s still on his knees, Arthur
tries to kick him in the stomach. The kick is deadened by the papers in
Toby’s bag, Arthur bends over Toby, screaming as if he has lost his
mind:</p>
<p><strong>you!</strong>: Toby gets up, and again Arthur sails in with
those wild roundhouse swings. Then Toby gets in a solid punch to
Arthur’s face that rocks the bigger boy back on his heels. Arthur grabs
his head and roars like a wounded buffalo. Almost immediately Arthur’s
eye puffs and begins to swell shut. Snot streaming from both nostrils,
still roaring, Arthur flies at Toby again. Toby closes with him, to hold
those flailing arms still, and the two stagger around the street like
drunken dancers. They separate, exchange a few blows, then grapple with
each other again. Then Arthur hooks Toby’s leg, trips him, and the two
roll off the shoulder of the road and down an embankment. They hit the
muddy bottom of the gully still hitting, flailing, kicking – first Toby
is on top, then Arthur, then Toby, then Arthur. By now they are panting,
each breath is a heave, a gasp. Then, suddenly, Arthur gives out
completely – he falls on top of Toby, pressing him deeper into the mud.
With his last bit of strength Toby throws the bigger boy off him and
sits up, while PEPPER BARKS FURIOUSLY at him and threatens to nip his
leg. Toby staggers to his feet and starts to climb the gully. He looks
relieved – at least it’s over. No, it’s not. From behind him he hears
three words.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Take it back.</p>
<p><strong>71 continued: 71</strong>: Toby turns to see a bloody-faced,
swollen-eyed Arthur clambering up the hill after him, like some monster
that won’t die. Both boys reach the top and stand facing one
another.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Take it back.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Say it.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Okay. I take it back.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: No, say ‘You’re not a sissy.’</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: You’re not a sissy.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: I won’t do it, you know. I won’t be a
referee between the two of you.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Who asked you?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: You both do. You do. Just by coming home
like this you ask me to take your side when he raises hell.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Well, the answer’s ‘No.’ I’m going to make
this marriage work. No fights.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Oh, the bride is calm. Who the hell cares?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: … seems like this place is so ugly. Seems
like everywhere I look there’s something… ugly.</p>
<p><strong>73 int. skipper and toby’s room - evening 73</strong>: A
worried Toby sits dreading Dwight’s arrival. Behind him, on the wall,
Toby has pinned the covers of fifteen copies of the Scout magazine: so
that, above Toby’s head are the words BOY’S LIFE fifteen times. There is
a MURMUR of VOICES, and FOOTSTEPS COMING toward Toby. Toby expects the
worst. But, surprisingly, Dwight is beaming.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Who won?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Uh, well, uh… he’s the one can’t see out of
one eye.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Hot damn! You actually gave little Lord
Gayle a black eye?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Well, it wasn’t black yet.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: But it was all puffed up? Then it was a
shiner.</p>
<p><strong>73 continued: 73</strong>: Dwight sits down next to Toby,
eager for details.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: How’d it start?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I called him a sissy.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Well, he sure’s hell can’t sue you for
slander. That boy fights for the pink team. Did you make him cry?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Well… he was just ready to. I called him a
big-assed, squat- to-pee sissy. I’d have won bigger except he hit me
when I wasn’t looking.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: He dry-gulched you. Now that’s your fault.
You gotta keep your guard up. There’s no excuse for getting dry-gulched.
I’ll show you a couple moves after supper that’ll leave Miss Arthur
Gayle wondering what month it is.</p>
<p><strong>74 int. dining room - evening 74</strong>: Still excited,
Dwight is holding forth for the whole family.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: … so he says, ‘You and who else’s army?’
‘Just the three of us,’ I say. ‘Me, myself and I.’ Well, after school
he’s waiting for me and he yells something – I tell you, with people
like that, you got to hurt ’em, gotta inflict pain, or they’ll never
leave you alone.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: So it was real hot out, okay? And there were
these horse turds laying all over the place. I picked one up and went up
to him, but not acting tough, okay? Acting more like, ‘Oh gee, I’m so
scared, please don’t hurt me.’ Sort of like this:</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: So I say, ‘Excuse me, but what’s the
problem?’ And he starts in on me again, blah, blah, blah, and I jam a
horse turd right into that big mouth. Then I give him a sucker punch in
the breadbasket, and he goes down like a…</p>
<p><strong>75 ext. utility porch - night 75</strong>: A steady downpour
falls outside the porch. Dwight and Toby, both stripped to the waist,
are boxing. Dwight is totally serious about this, absolutely sincere.
The sweat streaming off the two, Dwight patiently corrects Toby’s
movements, or catches the boy’s fist to suggest better form. Their feet
shuffle, squeak on the floor.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: No, no. From the shoulder. Straight. Like
this. This. Otherwise you leave yourself wide open. Yeah, better,
better… and keep those feet moving, shuffle, shuffle, that’s right… now
try for my face… good…</p>
<p><strong>76 int. living room - parallel time 76</strong>: Caroline is
on the telephone, her voice low. her, through a doorway, we can see
Dwight and Toby</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: … not good, to tell you the truth not good
at all. No, he’s not mean to me… No, he’s good about that: comes home
right after work every night. Oh, Marian, I don’t know – maybe I just
got my hopes too high, although I don’t think so. All I want is a
little… … a little son-of-a-bitching sweetness. That’s all. You think
so, huh? You always did have an eye for Dwight, didn’t you? The thing
is, he’s out on the porch teaching Jack to box right now. I keep
thinking if I can hang on, things’ll settle down. If I can just hang on
long enough, it’ll work out and my kid’ll have a father. You know?</p>
<p><strong>77 ext. utility porch - later 77</strong>: Both Dwight and
Toby sweating heavily. They lean against a wall, resting.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: You said you’d show me how to dry-gulch
somebody.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Okay. Now you can always kick somebody in
the balls, but I like this one better: What you do is hit ’em in the
throat with the side of your forearm. You wait ’til – hah!</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Now that’s dry-gulching. Hit ’em in the
throat, but do it before they’re expecting it. Now you try.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I’m afraid I’ll hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: You won’t.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: But I might.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Come onnn. You’re not trying.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Well, don’t go all shy and delicate on me –
you’re as sissy as little Miss Arthur Gayle. Yeah – I’ll just call you
‘Little Miss Jackie Wolff.’ Ooh, my, yes – Hello, Jackie.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Aw, Jesus Christ, if you’re gonna –</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: You just about got dry-gulched, my man.</p>
<p><strong>78 int. dwight and caroline’s bedroom - night 78</strong>:
Dwight and Caroline lie on the bed, kissing passionately. It is clear
that Caroline is as excited as Dwight.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: I know you may think this is silly,
Dwight, but it seems like… I don’t know, like an emblem or something. I
want to be able to see your face when we make love. How else can we be
cl –</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: You just don’t know what’s good, Sugar.
You’re too tense. You just relax and Dwight’ll take you on a little
trip. Okay? You’ll have a good time.</p>
<p><strong>78a same scene - hours later 78a</strong>: Dwight leans back
against the headboard of the bed. Caroline sits between his legs, her
back against his chest. With one hand, Dwight strokes Caroline’s hair.
The other hand is curled around her throat.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: … are the prettiest thing I’ve ever seen. I
mean it. You are. The way your hair curls up right there. So pretty. I
just love you so much. I don’t know what I’d do if you ever left me. I
couldn’t take it. Guy I knew in the Navy had a saying: ‘If you love her,
here’s what to do: Let her go visit places new. If she loves you, she’ll
come back to you. If she don’t come back… hunt the bitch down and kill
her.’ That’s awful, I guess. I don’t feel that way, but close. My pretty
thing…</p>
<p><strong>79 int. dwight and caroline’s living room - much later
79</strong>: Smoking a cigarette and wearing a nightgown, Caroline walks
to the front door. She opens the front door and stands looking out. Then
she puts her finger on the door and slowly pushes it shut with one
finger. She does this once more. Then she does it again. She turns,
walks toward Toby’s room.</p>
<p><strong>80 int. skipper and toby’s bedroom - night 80</strong>:
Caroline enters and stands by Toby’s bed. She bends over the boy and she
starts to touch his hair, decides not to. She stares at Toby for a few
beats.</p>
<p><strong>81 int. dwight and caroline’s bedroom - night 81</strong>:
Caroline enters, looks down at the sleeping Dwight. She gets back into
the bed and Dwight throws a sleepy hand over her. Caroline hesitates,
but forces herself to put a hand over Dwight’s.</p>
<p><strong>82 int. dwight and caroline’s kitchen - morning 82</strong>:
THROUGH a window, Dwight, dressed in his coveralls, leaves for work.
Caroline is sewing on a machine whilst Toby leans against the kitchen
sink.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: … but ask him again, why don’t you? I hate it
so much.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: I asked him a week ago, I asked him this
morning – he wants you to keep the paper route.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Then make him give me the money. It’s mine, I
earned it. It’s $220.00 already.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: He won’t. He says he’ll keep it for when
you really need it.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: That’s not fair. I ought to be able to have my
own money. But it’s mine.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: You remind me of a baby bird – you know
those frantic little things with their mouths wide open, wanting,
wanting.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Well, at least ask him about my gym shoes
again. I can practice barefoot but for games I gotta have shoes.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: I’m not a referee. I won’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Oh, we know, we know: the bride won’t argue.
The bride won’t raise her voice.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Well, I’ll tell you what the bride will
do: the bride will get up and walk over there and slap hell out of the
bride’s son. Now does the bride’s son want his face slapped?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Oh, I hate it here! I wish we could just get
up and go.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: I don’t have another ‘get up and go’ left
in me! You understand? I’m telling you I’ve hit a god- damn wall. I
can’t run anymore. Now this whole thing isn’t perfect for me, either…
let me impress that on you real strong, okay? I don’t wake up singing
every morning. But I’m going to make this marriage work – I won’t join
in any fights, you got that? I won’t even raise my voice!</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: See those two roses? He picked them for me
on his way home last night.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Big deal.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: I’m trying to concentrate on the good
stuff.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: What d’ya think? I think I look like a fool.
Who cares? Six weeks to graduation, and California, here I come!</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Seriously: you have to concentrate on the
good stuff.</p>
<p>****: “The Lawrence Welk Show” is ON the TELEVISION. Dwight,
Caroline, Skipper, Norma and Pearl and Toby watch an Irish tenor sing a
lugubrious ballad. Dwight stands in a corner of the room, his saxophone
to his lips. He’s playing along with the MUSIC, but silently.</p>
<p><strong>83 continued: 83</strong>: Faster and faster – Caroline’s
heel catches an end table and sends it spinning and faster they go.
Caroline’s head is thrown back; she’s laughing with pleasure. As the
MUSIC reaches its CLIMAX, Dwight spins Caroline back to the sofa, lets
her go, and WHAM! she lands back where she was seated exactly on the
last note of the song. Amid the general laughter and applause, Caroline
smiles at Toby.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Try to find the good stuff, honey.</p>
<p><strong>84 int. dwight and caroline’s living room - afternoon
84</strong>: Dwight and Toby face one another in the living room. Both
wear their Scout uniforms. Dwight holds a box of chocolate-coated
cherries in one hand.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I’m telling you I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: And I know damn well you did.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Well, you’re wrong.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: About some things, yeah. Not about this.
You’re a goddam hog, and I proved it.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: How do you know Skipper didn’t eat it? Or
Norma? Or Pearl?</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: I told all three of them to stay away from
this candy for twenty- four hours.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Well, how do you know I even ate any?</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: I counted them. You hogged down eleven
chocolate covered cherries since yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: So what?</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: So that makes you a hog. I just wanted to
establish that fact, and now I have.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Hey. Mr. Hotshot Hog and I’ve just been
establishing some facts, and what we come up with is this: One, he’s a
pig who gobbles down everybody’s candy; two, he lies about it; three, he
lays around on his lazy ass day and night reading, reading; and four,
he’s not getting any ten-dollar gym shoes. That’s about what we’ve come
up with so far.</p>
<p><strong>skipper</strong>: Oh, Dad…</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Oh, Dad!</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Why don’t you ever take up for me?</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Why don’t you ever help me straighten that
boy out?</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: All he does is read or listen to records or
sing.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: of a grotesque</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Oh, big, big deal, who cares, and as long as
we’re passing out news here, I don’t want to do my paper route
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: I bet you don’t – big lazy candy hog like
you’d rather lay on his ass and read, wouldn’t you? Let me tell you
something: you’re gonna deliver those papers if I have to walk behind
you with a horsewhip ever’ step of the way.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Then give me the money I earn!</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Hell, no. I’m putting that in the bank for
you for when you really need it – cuss me now, thank me later.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Mom, won’t you at least make him let me have
the shoes for gym? How can I play basketball without gym shoes? I’m the
only one who –</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: It’s not the shoes, is it? Or the candy. It’s
me, isn’t it? You just can’t stand the fact of me.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: I, well, no, it’s not that – I just want you
to be well-behaved. Your rich daddy ‘Duke’ doesn’t care anything about
you, and so somebody’s got to train you, and one of the things you’ve
gotta be trained about is not to be a hog and eat everybody’s candy like
a –</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: What’s the matter, honey?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>toby dwight</strong>: Are you sick, Mom? Don’t you feel
good?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: I. Will. Not. Referee.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Jack, I think you’ve made your mother
nervous, so why don’t we just go on to Scouts and let her rest? You lay
down and rest awhile.</p>
<p><strong>85 int. scout meeting - night 85</strong>: Father and son
photographs are being taken. Dwight is the only father who wears a
complete uniform and cap. When Dwight and Toby’s turn comes, Dwight puts
on a big smile and throws an arm around Toby’s shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Check for the tongue tonight – you forgot it
last week. Otherwise you won’t get your life-saving badge.</p>
<p><strong>85a same scene - later 85a</strong>: Six boys are lying on
the floor pretending unconscious- ness. Six other boys, Toby among them,
are going through several life-saving steps such as turning the bodies
over, checking for pulses, etc. The BOY on whom Toby is working is a
heavy, pimple-faced lout. Toby checks if the Boy’s breathing is
obstructed. Gingerly, he tugs on the Boy’s chin, starting to open the
Boy’s mouth. Suddenly the Boy opens his mouth wide, exposing a half-
chewed mass of cheese n’ crackers. Toby gives the lout a knee in the
ribs.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Bastard. Swallow that.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Give my pud a big squeeze while you’re at it,
why don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>86 ext. scout hall - night 86</strong>: As Toby kneels down
to tie his shoelace, a small black dog runs up to him. Toby pets it.
Arthur Gayle, his black eye healed, stands ten feet away.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: You like my dog?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Yeah, he’s nice.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Smart, too – he can talk.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Sure – I just about believe you.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Hey, Pepper – what’s on a tree?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Bark! Way to go, Pepper – pretty smart. Oh,
I was wondering, Pepper – I wanted to ask you something: how’s the world
treating you?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Rough! Yeah, I know what you mean.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: That’s dumb. A little funny, though. How come
your dad never comes to meetings with you?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: I don’t have a dad. Never did. I sprang
full-blown from my mother’s forehead. You want to walk home with me and
Pepper?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Sure – compared to a ride home with Dwight,
it’ll be like heaven on a June day.</p>
<p><strong>87 ext. residential street - night 87</strong>: Toby and
Arthur are eating ice cream cones and smoking cigarettes at the same
time. They walk slowly, desultorily. Though still effeminate, Arthur has
dropped much of the flounciness that he uses in public.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: … Tobias? Your real name is Tobias? Toby…
Tobias… I like it – it’s very elegant.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: My real parents would probably have given me
an elegant name, too. I say ‘real parents’ because I suspect I’m a
foundling. Somebody royal – or at least very, very beautiful had me and
gave me to my poor but honest mother. Tell me more about you.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Every day of my life feels like a mile on the
Bataan Death March.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: I knew I’d like you.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Why’d you point at me that day?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Because you’re an alien. You don’t belong in
Concrete any more than I do. This place would like to kill us because
we’re different.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Oh, come on, Arthur. That’s a little
dramatic.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Think so? You know what chickens do if one
chicken’s born with a little difference? With a few black feathers on
its head, say? They peck at the black spot ’til the chicken’s dead –
they can’t stand the fact that it’s different. Now we’re both different.
Your difference is something other than… … my difference… But we’re both
aliens here.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I don’t exactly feel like an alien. I’ve got
friends here.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Yes, and they’re fools. And you act like a
fool when you’re around them. A prediction: if you stay in Concrete,
you’ll wind up working at the A&amp;P – either that or you’ll go on a
rampage with a hunting rifle.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Yeah, and you’ll wind up a recluse that
everybody says likes to dress up in his mama’s old clothes.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Maybe, maybe, but no matter how many times I
have to repeat: my primary goal’s to get out of Concrete.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Burma-Shave!</p>
<p><strong>88 int. school gymnasium - night 88</strong>: Toby and ten
other boys are practicing lay-ups. All the boys, Toby included, wear
basketball uniforms. All the other boys wear gym shoes. Toby is
barefooted. He is however, a smooth, skillful player.</p>
<p><strong>90 int. utility porch - early evening 90</strong>: A large,
ugly DOG next to the box of baseball bats and gloves GROWLS and snaps at
Toby as he goes past.</p>
<p><strong>91 int. dwight and caroline’s living room - early evening
91</strong>: As Toby enters the room, Norma exits, wearing theatrical
makeup and a gypsy costume. Behind her, drink in hand, sits Dwight,
wearing a suit and tie, watching the TELEVISION NEWS with the SOUND VERY
LOW.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Whose dog is that on the porch?</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Yours.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Mine?</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: You said you wanted a dog.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: A collie, though. Not this one.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Well, he’s yours. You paid for him. Go get
ready for Norma’s play.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: What d’you mean I paid for him?</p>
<p><strong>92 int. skipper and toby’s room - afternoon 92</strong>: Toby
gets out his book of Indian signs. He reaches up for his rifle, but it
is gone.</p>
<p><strong>93 int. living room - afternoon 93</strong>: Toby walks in,
Dwight is petting the dog.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: My Winchester’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: This dog is pure-bred Weimaraner. A
champion.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I don’t want it.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Well, you’re purely out of luck, aren’t you,
’cause that rifle’s on its way to Seattle.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I want my rifle!</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Well, want in one hand and shit in the other
– see which gets full first.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: But, Dwight, that Winchester was mine.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: And Champ’s your dog. Jesus, I trade some
old piece of crap for a valuable hunting dog, and all you can do is piss
and moan.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I’m not pissing and moaning.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: The hell you aren’t. You can just make your
own deals from now on.</p>
<p><strong>94 ext. house - afternoon 94</strong>: Toby sits on the front
stoop. Caroline approaches carrying groceries. She notices Toby’s
expression.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Dwight traded my rifle for a dog. He says the
dog’s for me, but it’s some stupid dog he wanted.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: All right. Okay, Dwight. You stay here.
Don’t come inside.</p>
<p><strong>95 int. kitchen - afternoon 95</strong>: Norma, dressed up
for her play, and Pearl are setting the table. Dwight is fixing himself
another drink. Caroline enters, puts down the groceries, and goes to the
dish cabinet. Calmly, in total control, she takes a PLATE and SMASHES it
against the countertop.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Get his rifle back.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: But that dog’s a champion!</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Get his rifle back.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Am I supposed to go clear to Seattle just to
get…</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Get his rifle back.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Jesus Christ, woman, I don’t even know the
guy’s last name.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: All right, all right. The guy’s supposed to
send the A.K.C. papers. When he sends ’em, I’ll know his name and
address, and I’ll go get the god-damn rifle back. Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>96 ext. house - evening 96</strong>: Caroline walks to Toby,
sits next to him on the stoop.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Well, I did it – and the bride didn’t even
raise her voice: he says he’ll get the rifle back as soon as the guy who
sold him the dog sends the papers.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: ’Course, having seen that dog, I wouldn’t
suggest you hang by your thumbs ’til those papers come. I mean, that dog
is ugly.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: That’s nice – I haven’t seen a real smile
out of you in a month.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Oh, Mom, can’t we leave here? I hate it so
much. You don’t like it either – all you do is stick your head in a
sewing machine night and day. Let’s just leave and start over someplace
else.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: ‘Start over.’ Do you know how many times
I’ve started over, sweetheart? I don’t want to do it anymore. This is as
far as I want to go. This place. I have to make this work somehow. We
do. You’re fourteen now – you have to help me.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: But if…</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: But me no buts, honey. I told you: I’ve
hit a wall. And besides, it’s not so bad here, if you just try to –</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: If you say ‘look for the good stuff,’ I’m
gonna get Dwight’s 30/30 and shoot myself!</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Seriously, though: give the place a
chance. Give him a chance.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Great. Just great. What a life: I gotta live
with Dwight… I got a sissy for a new best friend…</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I got no rifle… I got no gym shoes…</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Well, look on the bright side… You got a
dog.</p>
<p><strong>97 int. arthur gayle’s living room - day 97</strong>: Arthur
is playing the piano. He and Toby sing an old song called “I Wandered
Today To the Hill, Maggie.” Both of them are enjoying it. As they finish
the song, Arthur says a dry “Will you be able to use your musical
abilities at the A&amp;P?” Toby laughs and gives him a hard elbow in the
ribs.</p>
<p><strong>98 int. toby’s room - night 98</strong>: Toby is using a nail
clipper over a wastebasket when he hears:</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Heh Hotshot!</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: If you can tear yourself away from your
pedicure, I want you to fetch me some of that paint from the attic.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Is now too soon.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: God!</p>
<p><strong>99 int. dwight’s attic 99</strong>: Dwight and Toby are
looking for something. They both shine flashlights around the dark
attic, illuminating old magazines, dolls, etc. Dwight says, “I know I
put ’em up here somewhere.” Then Toby’s flashlight lands on the unusual
tub with the four blue stars which had held the beaver. Forgotten all
this time, the beaver has transmogrified into a weird, two-foot high
pile of what looks like cotton candy. And, hideously enough, the
cloud-like stuff is still in the shape of the beaver. Then Dwight says,
“Shit – the roof must’ve leaked on ’em.” Toby turns to where Dwight
shines his flashlight on the ten boxes of chestnuts. Also forgotten, the
chestnuts are covered with mold, too – but a different kind: this is
wet, slick-looking stuff that rises off the chestnuts like dough in a
breadpan. A spasm of rage crosses Toby’s face, and he turns and bangs
out of the attic.</p>
<p><strong>100 int. dwight and caroline’s living room - night
100</strong>: A drink in one hand, idly fondling Champ’s ears with the
other, Dwight is watching the NEWS. On the TELEVISION we see a
distraught Lana Turner and her daughter, Cheryl Crane, as the teenaged
girl is led into a tall building. While we see this, and then a
photograph of a stockily handsome Italian man, we hear:</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: … Cheryl Crane, daughter of Lana Turner,
was held for questioning today in the stabbing death of Johnny
Stompanato, Miss Turner’s companion. A spokesman for Miss Turner said
today that the stabbing was an accident, and that Miss Turner’s daughter
will not spend even one night in jail for what the spokesman called a
‘tragic accident.’</p>
<p><strong>a whistle fades up.</strong>: Toby’s basketball game against
the Van Horn team is starting. Alone among all the other players, Toby
wears his street shoes. Heavy squarish brogans, they CLOMP, and THUD as
Toby runs up and down the court. The leather soles slip like skates on
the highly-polished floor, and Toby falls repeatedly. At first the crowd
is silent, collectively embarrassed at the boy wearing these strange
shoes. Then Toby takes a particularly hard fall, and somebody laughs.
The crowd in general takes it up, and soon there is GENERAL LAUGHTER
whenever Toby’s shoes SQUEAL particularly loudly, or whenever the shoes
trip him up or cause another boy to stumble.</p>
<p><strong>102 int. dwight’s garage - same night 102</strong>: The
Buick, rolls silently down the driveway pushed by a straining but
cautious Toby. Champ runs into the street, Toby tries to shoo him away.
The DOG BARKS ONCE, and Toby quickly opens the car door and lets him in,
STARTING the ENGINE.</p>
<p><strong>103 int. buick - late night 103</strong>: Toby drives fast
leaving Concrete behind. He turns the RADIO ON, and a VOICE bawls out
“Oh, Maybelline,” Toby turns the VOLUME UP, turns it UP AGAIN, so that
the MUSIC is DISTORTED. Toby begins to accelerate. The needle creeps
past ninety, and hovers close to one hundred.</p>
<p><strong>103 continued: 103</strong>: Trees flash past in the
headlights, occasional cars are overtaken and passed in an instant. Toby
starts laughing hysterically and sings loudly along with the
THROBBING</p>
<p><strong>music.</strong>: The Buick begins to shudder and wobble –
Toby hits the brakes but the Buick spins and goes sideways into the
ditch. SILENCE.</p>
<p><strong>104 ext. buick - late night 104</strong>: The car is caught
so that two of the wheels are off the ground, and can get no purchase.
Toby starts walking back toward Concrete.</p>
<p><strong>105 ext. road - late night 105</strong>: Toby and Champ have
been walking a long time. A truck comes from behind Toby, pulls
over.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: That your car in the ditch back there? How’d
you do that, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: It’s hard to explain.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Get in.</p>
<p><strong>107 ext. dwight and caroline’s house - dawn 107</strong>:
Toby silently closes the garage door, the Buick inside and heads for the
house.</p>
<p><strong>107a skipper and toby’s room - noon 107a</strong>: The clock
shows noon. Toby is in bed reading Boy’s Life, holding a sandwich and
trying to stay awake. Suddenly Dwight appears. Dwight puts his hands
into his pockets, leans against the doorway.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Your mother said you were sick. Feeling
better?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Yeah, I am.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Good, good. Get some sleep, did you?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Yeah, I slept about four hours.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Must’ve needed it.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Oh, by the way, you didn’t happen to hear a
funny pinging noise in the engine, did you?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: What engine?</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: I was downtown with Champ a few minutes ago,
and I met a guy who recognized him. Said he’d seen my dog this very
morning. Told me an interesting story of how he and the dog happened to
meet. What d’you think about that?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I don’t know what you –</p>
<p><strong>107a continued: 107a</strong>: Then he doubles up his fist
and slams it into the back of Toby’s neck. Toby goes rigid with pain.
Dwight stumbles up gasping for breath.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Only me. On this whole earth, to straighten
you out. And I will do it kill or cure. Now get your ass up – you’re
going to school.</p>
<p><strong>108 ext. high school - noon 108</strong>: A BELL RINGS as
Dwight’s BUICK SCREECHES to a stop and Toby gets out. As he heads toward
the doors. Toby then turns to stare at Dwight’s car. They lock eyes,
then Dwight smirks and pulls away. Toby watches the car disappear, then
spins around and walks into the school.</p>
<p><strong>108a same scene - afternoon 108a</strong>: The CAMERA is in
the EXACT SAME SPOT. The school seems a bit seedier, and two
newly-planted saplings established in the previous scene are both eight
feet taller, with wide spreading branches. Students pour out the door.
Among them Toby, taller and a bit heavier, he now wears black leather
boots, and a pack of cigarettes rolled into the sleeve of his T-shirt.
His hair is still pure Elvis.</p>
<p><strong>109 int. chuck bolger’s car - noon 109</strong>: As the car
barrels through downtown Concrete, we see a movie marquee reading…</p>
<p><strong>109 continued: 109</strong>: … The Apartment, and a five foot
poster that says,</p>
<p><strong>“elect john kennedy, 1960.”</strong>: In the back seat,
Psycho pours vodka into a half empty can of Hawaiian punch, then takes a
huge swig.</p>
<p><strong>psycho</strong>: Ag-Hhh! Gorilla blood.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Oh, Psycho, shut up.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Oh, look – there goes Carol Baumgarten. Ain’t
she sweet? She’s hot for Wolff.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I wish.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Won’t do her any good, though – Jack’s saving
himself for Rhea Clark.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Knock it off.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: You know what he said about Rhea? Said even
the inside of her arm turned him on. You slay me, Wolff. She is pretty
though.</p>
<p><strong>arch</strong>: I’d sure like to eat Rhea Clark’s pussy.</p>
<p><strong>jerry psycho chuck</strong>: God, here we Eatin’ pussy Jesus,
give it go again. is all that a rest, Arch.</p>
<p><strong>arch</strong>: No, I mean it. I’d like to get down and really
grovel on it. Spend about a week with my face right in it.</p>
<p><strong>109 continued: 109</strong>: There is a pause while all the
boys dwell on this thought. It sounds good to them.</p>
<p><strong>psycho</strong>: Aghhh, pussy!</p>
<p><strong>110 ext. dwight and caroline’s house - late afternoon
110</strong>: Chuck Bolger’s CAR SCREECHES to a halt, and Toby exits,
followed by an empty Hawaiian Punch can which someone tosses after him.
Toby gives a wave, starts toward the house, and the CAR LAYS RUBBER,
while OVER that we hear Psycho SCREAMING, “AGH-H-H!”</p>
<p><strong>111 int. dwight and caroline’s kitchen - late afternoon
111</strong>: Pearl is setting the table and singing the Everly Brothers
hit, “Bye, Bye, Love.” The passage of two years has improved Pearl. Her
bald spot has grown back in, and she has learned to fix her hair and use
makeup. She smiles and nods to Toby, never stopping her singing for a
moment. Toby stands next to her and sings harmony for a few notes. It is
clear that their relationship has improved. Toby stops singing.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Where’s Mom?</p>
<p><strong>112 int. living room - early evening 112</strong>: Caroline
is watching a newscast of John Kennedy and Harry Truman at a press
conference outside Truman’s Missouri office. She hears Toby, turns to
him. We see that the last two years have marked her. She’s changed. Her
expression is fixed, almost as if she were wearing a mask. Even the
words are cheerful, but some of the old optimism is gone.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Oh, honey, good news – Truman’s going to
campaign for him. I gave twenty-five dollars to his campaign office
today. I’ve been thinking I’d like to work…</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Here I am, you lucky people!</p>
<p><strong>113 int. kitchen - night 113</strong>: Dwight, Caroline, Toby
and Pearl sit at the table, eat- ing. Champ sits by Dwight’s chair –
obviously his dog. Dwight seems unchanged by the two years. Just now,
Dwight is in the middle of telling another of his “Dwight Is The Best”
stories. From the bored faces around the table, this is another in a
long series.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: … So the S.O.B. had been on my back for a
week at work, okay? Sayin’ I stole his wrench, an’ poured oil all over
his tools, as if! Anyway, he went just one step too far with old Dwight,
okay? Spat on the floor as I walked by. I turned around and walked back
to him, acting so dainty and humble and scared, you know, all innocent –
and the minute he took his eyes off me, BLAM, I dry gulched him! I shut
his water off good! Never gave me another second’s grief to this very
day.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: I heard Kennedy on the news again tonight
– I don’t know: I hate the Democrats and the Republicans, but then once
in a while somebody comes along who doesn’t seem like… … a liar.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Kennedy – the senator from Rome.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: He gives me hope.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: I know what he gives you, and it sure as
hell isn’t hope.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: It’s true he is attractive! And it may
just be those white teeth that I respond to. But I don’t think so. I’m
going to work for his campaign.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: No. Too many Republicans in this town. They
hear my wife’s working for the Democrats, they’ll take their cars
someplace else to be fixed. Bad idea. No.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Oh, Rickyyy! Oh, Ricky-y-y! Please let me
come down and work at the club!</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: What the hell are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Well, you treat me like Lucy, I’ll act
like her. I’ll be working for Kennedy’s campaign.</p>
<p><strong>frightened man</strong>: … please, Mr. Capone, it’ll never
happen again, I swear it. It was an accident. I can promise you
faithfully it won’t be repeated.</p>
<p><strong>al capone</strong>: Why don’t you take a little ride with
Frank?</p>
<p><strong>115 int. bathroom - same night 115</strong>: Toby is brushing
his teeth when Dwight enters.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I’ll be through in a minute.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: You left the lid off the damn toothpaste
again.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Oh, Dwight, is that the best you can come up
with?</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: This is my bathroom, and I say about the
toothpaste, got it? Huh? Have you? Huh? Now if you lived with your daddy
Duke and his rich wife, maybe things’d be different, but he’s not here
now, is he? Oh, Duke? Duke, are you here? Dukie? Oh, how sad – Duke’s
not here. Oh, boo hoo! My bathroom. I get to say. Got that?</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Come on. Oh, come on. Give me an excuse.</p>
<p><strong>116 int. hallway - night 116</strong>: Toby exits the
bathroom, then sees Caroline in a doorway. She’s heard it all. They look
intently at each other. Toby nods and walks on down the hall.</p>
<p><strong>118 int. school bus - next morning 118</strong>: Toby bangs
onto the bus, throws himself into a seat beside Arthur. He hands a grade
card to Toby.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: You didn’t pick this up yesterday –
congratulations, you got nothing higher than a C.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: You’re gonna get caught some day. You act
more like those morons you hang around with every day. Aghhh! I’m
psycho! I’m retarded!</p>
<p><strong>118 continued: 118</strong>: It’s a good imitation of Psycho,
and Toby laughs.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: He hears you do that, you’re dead. Hey, lemme
copy your math homework.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: No, but I’ll show you how to work the
problems.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I tell you I’m thirsty, you offer me a
sandwich thank you and fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Oh, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Oh, Jaaack!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: I take it back you don’t act like Psycho,
you act like Dwight.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I know it. He’s winning. I do act like him. I
feel like him sometimes. I’ve gotta get out of this place or I’m a dead
one.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: I know, but you’ve said that for two
years.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I mean it. I may go live with my brother
Gregory in Princeton.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: You mean the brother Gregory in Princeton
who never calls you? That brother Gregory?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: He wrote me.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: And he asked you to live with him?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: No. But I’m going. Or maybe I could go to a
prep school like Gregory did. Like my dad did.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: What about your grades? And what would you
use for money?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I don’t know. Dwight owes me over twelve
hundred bucks! If I hadn’t let him keep my paper route money, I’d be
okay.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: If the dog hadn’t stopped to pee, he’d have
caught the rabbit.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I think Dwight was right about you I think you
fight for the pink team.</p>
<p><strong>119 ext. residential neighborhood - afternoon 119</strong>:
His mood even fouler, Toby toils at his paper route. He throws the
papers against the houses with all his might. Suddenly Chuck Bolger’s
CAR SCREECHES to a stop next to Toby. We hear Psycho’s “Arghhh!” and
Toby climbs into the car.</p>
<p><strong>120 ext. derelict crusher plant - night 120</strong>: We see
the Concrete silo dimly-lit in the distance. We can read “Welcome To
Concrete” on it. Toby is leaning against a wall in a large derelict
Concrete plant staring at the silo. Behind him is a small campfire where
the other guys are slumped around talking. Toby takes a long, angry pull
on a bottle of whiskey, then turns around and heads toward them.</p>
<p><strong>arch</strong>: Nobody in your family ever even been in a
Corvette, let alone owned one.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: You wait and see if I don’t get one. I’m
gonna move down to Seattle, get a job at Bendix and drive a ’Vette to
work every day.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: My uncle can have any car he wants. He makes
big bucks as an electrician.</p>
<p><strong>arch</strong>: Yeah? How big?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Hundred seventy-five a week, take home.</p>
<p><strong>psycho</strong>: Bullshitter!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Fuck you, it’s true.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Even the supervisors at Bendix don’t make
that.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: So how are you ever gonna make enough to
drive a ’Vette then, fuck-face?</p>
<p><strong>psycho</strong>: I’m gonna drive a T-bird, someday.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: An’ I’m gonna own a Corvette if I have to
hold up the Bendix payroll to get it.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>arch</strong>: Me. I want to eat a big red-haired pussy.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Losers. What a bunch of losers.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Who you calling a loser, fuck-face?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: All of you. You’re gonna drive a Fairlane just
like your daddy does. How you ever going to drive a Thunderbird when
you’re a janitor like the rest of your family? An’ you can forget being
an electrician, you can’t even pass tenth grade math.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Well fuck you. Who died an’ made you King
Shit?</p>
<p><strong>psycho</strong>: Yeah, you’re no better than us.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I know that, Psycho. That’s my point: Ha, ha,
ha. You guys are my buddies. You guys are my pals. And my dear old dad’s
called Dwight. Welcome to Concreeee…</p>
<p><strong>122 int. kennedy campaign office - day 122</strong>: Toby
enters the small office where Caroline is running hundreds of flyers on
a duplicating machine. Surprised she sees Toby’s expression.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I called Gregory at Princeton. He’s sending me
applications for prep schools. I need you to take me to Seattle to take
some entrance exams.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Would a prep school take you with, uh,
your school record?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I’ve got to get out of here, Mom. I’ve got to.
I’ve got to get away.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: When are the tests?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Saturday.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: You’ll be there.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: He won’t let you have the Buick.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: You’ll be there!</p>
<p><strong>123 ext. lakeside school in seattle - day 123</strong>:
Graceful buildings, green lawns, a CARILLON CHIMING. Toby walks toward a
large building.</p>
<p><strong>124 int./ext. testing room - day 124</strong>: Twenty-three
boys and Toby stand waiting restlessly for the tests to begin. Toby
looks very different from the other intelligent looking, well-bred boys
in his Elvis hairdo.</p>
<p><strong>124a same scene - later 124a</strong>: All the boys are
taking the test, working hard.</p>
<p><strong>125 int. dwight’s buick - late afternoon 125</strong>:
Caroline turns as Toby gets into the car.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: How was it?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Hard. I think I did okay. I’ll know
Monday.</p>
<p><strong>126 int. dwight and caroline’s kitchen - evening
126</strong>: Dwight sits at the table, a drink in his hand. Caroline
hurriedly prepares dinner. She tosses a milk carton into a brimming
waste basket, then speaks to Toby, who enters the room.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Take that trash out for me, honey.</p>
<p><strong>127 ext. rear of dwight and caroline’s house - evening
127</strong>: Toby opens a metal trash can, dumps the trash, puts the
lid back on, and then hesitates. He lifts the lid again and peers into
the trash can, almost hidden, are the tips of four white envelopes made
of heavy, expensive paper. He pulls them up and, though covered with
tomato seeds, are undamaged.</p>
<p><strong>128 int. kitchen - evening 128</strong>: Toby walks in, fans
out the four envelopes, speaks to Caroline.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: My application forms must’ve come today, and
he threw them away.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Hey, I thought I was helping him – thought
I’d save him some trouble ’cause he’s got no chance of getting into some
fancy prep school.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: You’ve always got your nose pressed up
against the bake shop window, don’t you, Dwight?</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: You feel like everybody else is inside,
and you’re stuck on the outside. It turns you mean. It turns you ugly.
And one day do you hear me, Dwight? One day all that ugliness is going
to snap back and hit you in the face.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Ooooooh, oh, I’m so scared. Oooh.</p>
<p><strong>129 int. toby’s bedroom - same night 129</strong>: Toby has
the applications open in front of him. We see the words “Official
Transcript Required” on one application. On another we see spaces for
the ap- plicant to list “Community Services” and “Athletic Achievements”
and “Foreign Travel” and “Languages.” Toby looks despairingly at the
forms.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: I won’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: But why? You work right in the office –
nobody’ll ever know.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: I’m surprised you’d want help from anybody
who fights for the pink team.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I’m asking you to help me, man. I got word
yesterday that I did really well on those tests – but that’s not enough.
I’ve got to cheat and lie – but I don’t care: this is my one chance to
get out of here!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: No. Why should you get to be the one? Why
not me?</p>
<p><strong>131 int. school workshop - day 131</strong>: Toby is working
with a table saw. Suddenly a two-inch- thick manilla envelope plops down
beside him. He looks up to see Arthur standing beside him. Glancing
around to see that he’s unobserved, he checks the contents of the
envelope: we see school stationery, blank transcript forms, and a stack
of official envelopes. Toby closes his eyes. He’s saved.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: You could leave too, you know.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: No, I’ve grown progressively fond of
Concrete. I think I’ll stay here all alone and dress up in my mama’s old
clothes sometimes – like you said.</p>
<p><strong>132 int. typing lab - same day 132</strong>: With his hand
bandaged Toby sits at a typewriter with a blank transcript. He carefully
types “TOBIAS WOLFF.” Then, he begins to type the letter “A” in every
slot for grades.</p>
<p><strong>133 ext. street - evening 133</strong>: Toby mails five
letters.</p>
<p><strong>134 int. toby’s bedroom - day 134</strong>: Toby lies in bed
reading the paper. He still holds his hand in the air .</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Come help me stuff envelopes.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I’ll do some this afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: No, I need to take them with me.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I’ll be in in a minute. Let me finish this
article.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Boy, you irritate me. I think maybe you
ought to… Yeah – I think maybe you should just…</p>
<p><strong>dwight.</strong>: Toby laughs, and gets up to help her.</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: ‘You got letters from those schools!’</p>
<p><strong>136 ext. field - early evening 136</strong>: Three letters
lie crumpled on the ground. Toby sits with his back against a tree
trunk. Slowly Toby opens the fourth letter. Another refusal. Toby tosses
it onto the ground with the others, leans his head back against the tree
trunk, and closes his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>137 int. dwight and caroline’s living room - night
137</strong>: Dwight, Caroline and Toby read the papers. Caroline
notices Toby’s sad face.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Maybe that last school will come
through.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Yeah, or maybe he’ll get a contract in the
mail asking him to be a singing star on T.V. Well, he’s got about as
much chance of one as of the other.</p>
<p><strong>138 ext. concrete - same night 138</strong>: A beauty shop
with a tired sign… “ARLENE’S GOLDEN COMB BEAUTY SALON,” a beer joint, a
pool hall, a woman’s clothing store with headless mannequins. Toby
surveys the scene, with an expression of despair. Toby catches his
reflection in a store window. He stares at himself.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: A Concrete boy.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: We only take boys who really want to work
hard. Is that you? I’d want you to start evenings now, and I’d want you
all summer – no vacations. Food service work isn’t easy. It’s not
something that comes to you in a year or two. So. You think you have
what it takes to be an A&amp;P management trainee?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: That’s exactly what I’ve got.</p>
<p><strong>139a same scene - later 139a</strong>: Toby now wears a
regulation black bow tie and an apron. An employee is showing him how to
price, stamp, and stack canned goods. Toby’s face is expressionless.</p>
<p><strong>140 int. dwight and caroline’s living room - late afternoon
140</strong>: Dwight is listening to a PERRY COMO ALBUM. Caroline and
Pearl work on a jigsaw puzzle. Toby enters the kitchen, coming from his
paper route. He puts down his paper sack and immediately puts on his
black bow tie, preparing to go to the A&amp;P.</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: I can’t find where this green piece goes –
it’s gotta be grass.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Don’t go off without eating.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I’ll get a sandwich after work.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: I was trying to listen to a record.</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: “Yeah, he’s here,”</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Hello? All right. Tomorrow, then. Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: It’s Hill School – the last one I applied to.
They haven’t accepted me, but they’re sending somebody up to interview
me.</p>
<p><strong>141 int. drugstore - afternoon 141</strong>: Toby is sitting
in a booth with MR. HOWARD, a man in his late thirties. Toby has made a
real attempt to look good. His hair is modified, and he wears a tie and
a suit.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: … Yeah, I enjoy my classes, especially the
ones that are advanced, but I’ve been feeling a little restless lately.
It’s hard to explain.</p>
<p><strong>mr. howard</strong>: Well, you’re probably bored. Not being
challenged. Your application was very good, Toby, but we have many boys
who want to go to Hill. Not everybody is comfortable at a prep
school.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I think I would be. My father and brother went
to prep schools.</p>
<p><strong>mr. howard</strong>: Is that right? Where?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Deerfield and Choate.</p>
<p><strong>mr. howard</strong>: I see. Well, maybe you’d like it. Hill
was difficult for me, though – classes were hard, and the boys seemed
cold – interested in money and social position. And I hated those snowy
Pennsylvania winters! But then in my last year, something changed. The
guys in my class grew close, so close that I still think of them as a
second family.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I want that. I do, and –</p>
<p><strong>141 continued: 141</strong>: He stops talking as we hear,
O.S., “AG-H-H-H!” Psycho and Arch have entered the drugstore. Toby’s
back is to the door, and he slouches deeper into the booth, praying that
he won’t be seen. Arch and Psycho buy cigarettes.</p>
<p><strong>arch</strong>: … so she said, ‘No, I don’t want you to do
that,’ and I said ‘Oh, baby, let me get down and grovel on it.’ I mean,
I ate her pussy ’til my tongue was calloused, and then…</p>
<p><strong>arch</strong>: … so anyway, she went off like a Roman candle
– I mean that woman can scream. I said, ‘You liked that, didn’t you,
baby?’ I said, ‘You liked the old Arch Cook special, didn’t you?’</p>
<p><strong>mr. howard</strong>: Toby, boys at Hill talk roughly
sometimes too – you’d have to be ready for that. I can see you’ve had
sort of a sheltered life.</p>
<p><strong>142 ext. drugstore - afternoon 142</strong>: Mr. Howard
shakes Toby’s hand.</p>
<p><strong>mr. howard</strong>: You seem like a fine boy, and I’ll give
you a good report tomorrow. But there are lots of boys applying, and
we’ll just have to wait and see whether –</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Ohh, it’s the Hotshot Boy.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Yeah, it’s the guy who thinks he knows
everything. Thinks he’s so smart, but fella, what you don’t know would
fill a book. General Motors makes shit cars.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: That’s, uh, that’s this guy… he’s a mechanic…
did some bad work on our car…</p>
<p><strong>143 int. a &amp; p grocery store - night 143</strong>: A few
weeks have passed. Toby again prices and stacks food. His face is
serious, his manner industrious.</p>
<p><strong>144 int. dwight and caroline’s kitchen - afternoon
144</strong>: Toby walks in; his Elvis hair disappearing. Pearl, who is
boiling hot dogs, turns:</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: I know something’ll make you feel good: that
man called – you got the scholarship.</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: He said they’re gonna give you two thousand
three hundred dollars a year and it costs two thousand five hundred
dollars… so you gotta come up with the other two hundred. Great, huh?
I’m making hot dogs – I’ll make one for you. Can you put mustard on some
bread for us?</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: What’re you doing home so earl… Oh! Toby he
got that scholarship – two thousand and three hundred dollars!</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Hey, leopard. I say, ‘Hey, leopard.’ I know
you, leopard – I can see those spots you can’t change. Thinks he can go
to some fancy prep school and fool everybody. Not a chance. I know a
thing or two about a thing or two.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Who threw that away?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I did.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Because it was empty.</p>
<p><strong>144 continued: 144</strong>: Dwight retrieves the bottle.
There are a few streaks of mustard under the neck of the bottle. He
holds it close to Toby’s face.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Empty? That look empty to you?</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: It looks empty to me.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: It looks empty to me, too.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Look again, hotshot. Is it empty?</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: Dad!</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Now. Now, Mr. Big-Time Prep- School fucker,
is it empty?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: No, it wasn’t empty.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: All right – clean it out.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Now. Was it empty?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Get away from him or I will kill you.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I got the scholarship and he went nuts. He’s
crazy, and I’m leaving. I’m leaving!</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Great. Go!</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Give me my paper route money, and you’ll never
have to see my face again.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: That money is gone with the wind. That’s
right. I spent it as you made it. It’s gone. Poof.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: It’s not so much that you’re disappointing
– it’s that you’re consistently disappointing.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Oh, fancy, fancy talk – fancy talk for a
whore. I know a thing or two about a thing or two. I got friends in this
town that tell me things, and I found out some man down at that campaign
headquarters found you a job in Washington, D.C. Gonna run off with him,
aren’t you, Miss Whore?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: He’s just a friend.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Miss Liar. Miss Whore Liar.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I’m leaving, Mom. You can leave, too. You
don’t have to stay here.</p>
<p><strong>144 continued: 144</strong>: Caroline takes three full beats
and then her face changes. She speaks wonderingly:</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: I don’t, do I?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: No, you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: I could leave with you, couldn’t</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Yes, you could!</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: What about me?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: I could just walk right out that door,
couldn’t I?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Yes, you could!</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: My God… the lightness.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: What about me?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: I’m leaving, too.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Oh, Dwight, why do you want me to stay?
You don’t even like me, not really.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: You’re not leaving!</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Look again, Dwight – I’m already gone.</p>
<p><strong>144 continued: 144</strong>: Dwight makes a terrible noise of
frustration and rage, doubles his fists, and starts toward Caroline.
Immediately Toby grabs the baseball bat and holds it out, ready to
strike, as the two begin to back toward the door.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: … you two’ve always sided in against me,
always thought you were better than me. I tried. I did the best I could.
What about me? Am I supposed to just crawl off in a ditch someplace and
die? I’ve always been the nigger. Everybody’s nigger. Ever since I was
little.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: What about me? When is it ever Dwight’s turn
for some consideration? What about me? I’ll tell you one thing – you’ll
remember me!</p>
<p><strong>145 ext. field - minutes later 145</strong>: Caroline and
Toby slow to a walk after running, laughing, and catch their
breaths.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Man, oh man.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Man, oh man, oh man.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Well, we’re out.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Great, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Yes. It’s great. And you got the
scholarship! Congratulations, honey.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Yeah, I’m out! I’m outta here! Maybe I’ll
crash and burn, but it’s a chance, so I’m gone! I’m history, Histoire.
Nobody’s gonna tell me what to do now, nobody. I’m free as a bird.
Sayonara nest. Heaven on a June day!</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Yeah, heaven on a June day…</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: What’d he say about you having a job in
D.C.?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Oh, Helen found me something in a real
estate office, but…</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: So now you can go! Oh. Oh! I am so damn glad
to get out of this place! I’ll be in ‘fourth form.’ Doesn’t that sound
great? And if you get a two-bedroom place in D.C., I can come for
vacations and summers. I’m out. I’m out!</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: What? Oh, don’t cry – he’s not worth it.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: She holds Toby at arm’s length and studies
him.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: My you’ve grown, haven’t you.</p>
<p><strong>146 ext. bus station - day 146</strong>: Caroline and Toby
stand next to a bus as the driver STARTS the ENGINE. She is close to
tears.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Are you sure you’ll be all right?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Get on the bus.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: I borrowed money from everybody I know –
it’s the two hundred you need for the tuition, and an extra fifty. Buy
yourself a blazer. Oh, God. I’ll miss you. I’ll write you. You sure your
hand’s okay?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Get on the bus, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I know that, Mom. I’ve always known that.</p>
