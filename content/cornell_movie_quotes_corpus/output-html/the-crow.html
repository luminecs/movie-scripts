<p><strong>eric</strong>: What the hell are you?</p>
<p><strong>skull cowboy</strong>: Interested? Follow the crow.</p>
<p><strong>t-bird</strong>: Uncle T-Bird’s 100-proof accelerator. I
squirt you with this, you could jump in the Detroit river and burn all
the way to the bottom.</p>
<p><strong>t-bird</strong>: You know, Lake Erie actually caught on fire

<p><strong>mickey</strong>: You want I should save this for you?</p>
<p><strong>skank</strong>: Dump her, man, dump her!</p>
<p><strong>nb</strong>: Eric’s flashes of past memory are conditioned by
the nature of things with which he makes physical contact. Hints and
fragments in fierce, super-saturated COLOR. Puzzle pieces he must
assemble. Each flash keynoted by a BLOWBACK NOISE and accompanied by a
degree of pain. It hurts to remember.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: Here now! You’re gonna be okay! Can you
understand me? I’m a police officer…</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: He touched me and it stopped. The pain.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: I saw a ghost…</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: Oh no… don’t go, darlin’, you stay with
me, now… shit!</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Fire. In the rain.</p>
<p><strong>ngo nwa</strong>: He will see me… unannounced.</p>
<p><strong>nb</strong>: The following exchange will play FAST, and
entirely in</p>
<p><strong>lao</strong>: When I spoke of an offering, I didn’t mean an
offering to you.</p>
<p><strong>grange</strong>: You gonna smoke his bones now, or however it
is you do it?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: “My kitten walks on velvet feet, and makes no
sound at all. And in the doorway nightly sits to watch the darkness
fall. I think he loves the lady night…” Am I alive? Am I dead? Something
else? Something in between?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Thanks for sharing that.</p>
<p><strong>gideon</strong>: Ahhh, jesus, the creatures of the night,
here they come. Tweedledum and Tweedledummer.</p>
<p><strong>skank</strong>: Hey, blow me, fat boy!</p>
<p><strong>gideon</strong>: Blow yourself, bigmouth.</p>
<p><strong>t-bird</strong>: Whoa, hey, whoa. Business.</p>
<p><strong>gideon</strong>: Whatcha got?</p>
<p><strong>t-bird</strong>: Coupla more rings… 24k.</p>
<p><strong>gideon</strong>: 18k. Crap.</p>
<p><strong>t-bird</strong>: …necklace… pearls…</p>
<p><strong>gideon</strong>: Nineteen bucks at Sears. Fake,</p>
<p><strong>t-bird</strong>: Leather purse…</p>
<p><strong>gideon</strong>: What’s this – a little, ah, bloodstain,
right? Fifty bucks for the box, and I’m doin’ you a –</p>
<p><strong>t-bird</strong>: Yeah, I know, fatso. Do us all a favor. Make
Top Dollar smile.</p>
<p><strong>skank</strong>: You wouldn’t want Top Dollar not to
smile.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Gotcha.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Where’re we going next – the sewer?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Are we finished yet?</p>
<p><strong>close-up - eric’s hand on banister</strong>: sliding along,
as he speaks, until it hits a cigarette burn.</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: IMAGES and DIALOG are not linked. A rapidfire
MONTAGE set in the loft, a year earlier . The broken door. The stairwell
is filled with cops and cop noise; lab guys bustle. Albrecht is there,
making notes as a DETECTIVE steps over to him.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: Victim’s name is Shelly Webster. The guy
who got tossed is, uh …–</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: “Draven, Eric.”</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: Hey! You got any ID?</p>
<p><strong>elly</strong>: Very funny. Ha. Ha. Oh my, sides.</p>
<p><strong>elly</strong>: Mom –?</p>
<p><strong>darla</strong>: I told you you’re not supposed to come in
here.</p>
<p><strong>elly</strong>: I lost my key.</p>
<p><strong>funboy</strong>: Hey, Darla – before we die of old age, how
about it –?</p>
<p><strong>darla</strong>: Out. Now. I gotta work.</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: we HEAR Eric strumming his Strat o.s. We see
what he saw: Shelly, holding the cat.</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: A MAN and a WOMAN make love on a big bed
amidst a hundred points of candlelight. Shelly and Eric, once upon a
time.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: No! Don’t look! No! No!</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: Eric and Shelly in a mock waltz. He spins her
and they collapse on the bed.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Stop it.</p>
<p><strong>funboy</strong>: Let’s have some fun.</p>
<p><strong>tin-tin</strong>: You’re outta your fuckin’ mind.</p>
<p><strong>t-bird</strong>: No. I’m not the lunatic. He is.</p>
<p><strong>skank</strong>: Fuck you, T-Bird.</p>
<p><strong>t-bird</strong>: I love you too, you madman.</p>
<p><strong>funboy</strong>: Hey, pussycat.</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: Shelly spills into frame, mouth bloodied.
T-Bird instantly on top of her, rough.</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: Eric held firm in the grasp of T-Bird and
Funboy, one arm each. Five bloody bullet holes in Eric’s chest.</p>
<p><strong>funboy</strong>: More fun than a torture chamber.</p>
<p><strong>tin-tin</strong>: I hate this goddamn thing…</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: We have company.</p>
<p><strong>skull cowboy</strong>: Having fun yet? No? I’ll give you a
hint. Remember whatshername?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Shelly?</p>
<p><strong>skull cowboy</strong>: Miss her?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>skull cowboy</strong>: Kill the men who killed you both, and
the Day of the Dead will be your reunion.</p>
<p><strong>skull cowboy</strong>: You must use your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Goddammit.</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: Eric bouncing off the bedroom doorframe,
Tin-Tin’s knife stuck in his shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>skull cowboy</strong>: Get it?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Leave me alone – !</p>
<p><strong>skull cowboy</strong>: Do something about it.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I guess I’m not ready to leave… just yet.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: The last time we saw each other, I didn’t do
so well. Huh, Gabriel?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I bet you need some cat food… right?</p>
<p><strong>tin-tin</strong>: Three hundred and your a gunslinger.</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: Please, TIn-Tin, you know I’m good for the
money, man, I promise, Leslie put me up to it, please, man, don’t –</p>
<p><strong>tin-tin</strong>: Ratty – shut the fuck up.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Another satisfied customer?</p>
<p><strong>tin-tin</strong>: Who the hell is that? Come on out man, I
won’t hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Hello, Tin-Tin.</p>
<p><strong>tin-tin</strong>: Little early from trick-or-treat, homie.
This dick trying to bushwack me.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Murderer.</p>
<p><strong>tin-tin</strong>: Guess you got that goddamn right.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Try harder. Try again.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: A year ago. Halloween. A man and a woman. In a
loft. You helped to murder them.</p>
<p><strong>tin-tin</strong>: Last Halloween, eh? Yeah… Yeah, I remember.
I fucked her too, I think.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: You cut her. You raped her. You watched!</p>
<p><strong>tin-tin</strong>: Hey, I got my rocks off, so fuck you in the
ass, man.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I want you to tell me a story, Tin-Tin.</p>
<p><strong>tin-tin</strong>: I don’t know you…</p>
<p><strong>tin-tin</strong>: Holy shit… you’re dead, man…</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Victims. Aren’t we all.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Halloween is coming. The Day of the Dead…</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: Shelly, sleeping on her divan, a year ago,
wakes as Eric says “Boo”. She cracks an eye open.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Your scary quotient needs work.</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: Shelly at the vanity in happier times</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: I think red’s my color, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: Eric smashes into the street after his
death-fall, trailing broken glass.</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: Eric sucks up Funboy’s gunshots in the chest.
1-2-3-4.</p>
<p><strong>skull cowboy</strong>: Glad to see you’re finally with the
program.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Bugger off to the graveyard, skull- face, I’m
busy.</p>
<p><strong>skull cowboy</strong>: You work for the dead. Forget that,
and you can forget it all.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Forget this.</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: Eric, smashed on the street, T-Bird’s car
b.g., upside down in Eric’s POV as he rolls over and blood courses from
both corners of his mouth, a definite foreshadow of the “Crow” face.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: She always red red was her color.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: All right, bad guys…</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Here I commme – !</p>
<p><strong>torres</strong>: Couldn’t have happened to a nicer
couple.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: Sure it coulda. Funboy’s not here, neither
is T-Bird – none of Top Dollar’s number ones.</p>
<p><strong>torres</strong>: You know, you sure got a hard-on for a guy
that’s guilty of zip on paper. Top Dollar runs Showtime; what’s the
matter, don’t you like adult entertainment?</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: This sack of shit is called Tin- Tin.</p>
<p><strong>torres</strong>: Don’t any of your little pals have real,
grown up names?</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: He was a runner for Top Dollar. Just
muscle.</p>
<p><strong>torres</strong>: Was.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: This isn’t Top Dollar’s style anyway. This
was somebody else. Somebody new.</p>
<p><strong>torres</strong>: And you’re gonna tell me who.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: Who ever made that.</p>
<p><strong>torres</strong>: What in the hell… do you call that?</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: I call it blood, Detective. If you want,
you can call it graffiti.</p>
<p><strong>gideon</strong>: Piss off, we’re closed.</p>
<p><strong>gideon</strong>: Fucking creatures of the night; they never
goddamn learn.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: “Suddenly I heard a tapping, as of someone
gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.” You heard me rapping,
right?</p>
<p><strong>gideon</strong>: Oh, bullshit! You’re trespassing asshole,
you’re breakin’ and enterin’ and you just bought me a fucking door!</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I’m looking for something in an engagement
ring. Gold.</p>
<p><strong>gideon</strong>: You’re looking for a coroner,shit-
for-brains!</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I repeat: a gold engagement ring. It was
pawned here, a year ago, by another gentleman whose name, I believe was…
“T-Bird”?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Cute nickname, don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>gideon</strong>: I ain’t got no fuckin’ ring.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Wrong answer.</p>
<p><strong>gideon</strong>: All’s I got is in a box! Behind the
counter!</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: No… no… no… no…</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: Shelly’s face. A perfect vision…</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Tin-Tin confided in me, before he ran out of
breath. You have one chance to live.</p>
<p><strong>gideon</strong>: No fucking way. He’ll kill me.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Who would waste time killing you… besides
me?</p>
<p><strong>gideon</strong>: Top Dollar.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Another jolly nickname?</p>
<p><strong>gideon</strong>: You want those assholes, you want Top
Dollar.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: T-Bird?</p>
<p><strong>gideon</strong>: Like the car. He hangs out with Skank. that
little ass-hair, and they hang at the Pit – hell, Funboy lives there.
Ask Top Dollar.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: A whole club of pirates, with pirate
names…</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: You feed off the living.</p>
<p><strong>gideon</strong>: You walk outta here Top Dollar will erase
your ass! Top Dollar owns the fucking street here and you can’t dick
with me, you son of a bitch!</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: One chance to live. Take it.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: Don’t move! I said don’t move.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I thought the police always said “freeze:.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: I’m the police and I say don’t move, Snow
White. You’re under arrest; I don’t care what else is wrong with you!
You move and you’re dead.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: And I say I’m dead… and I move.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: No further. I’m serious.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Then shoot, if you will.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: Are you nuts, walking into a gun?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: You must listen carefully: the Fire Department
will be here soon. There is an injured man in the alley who needs
assistance. As Shelly Webster once needed your assistance, and as you
are shortly going to need my assistance.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: You wanna run that back for me one
time?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Listen: Top Dollar. He “owns the street here.”
He will “erase my ass.”</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: You don’t say.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I know Top Dollar has turned your streets into
his hell.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: Fucking A, my friend.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: The others are called Skank, T- Bird. Street
names. Funboy. Watch me, office Albrecht.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: Watch it…</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: You’re the one who did Tin-Tin…</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: Great. Good night. Guy shows up looking
like a mime from hell. Least he didn’t do that “walking against the
wind” shit; I hate that.</p>
<p><strong>dickey bird</strong>: T-Bird. Thrill me.</p>
<p><strong>t-bird</strong>: Business.</p>
<p><strong>porn queen</strong>: I don’t know how to describe how I feel,
Lance – so restless –</p>
<p><strong>porn king</strong>: You’re my Moon Queen, Angelique.</p>
<p><strong>top dollar</strong>: Wild fucking night. I hear our pal
Tin-Tin got himself very dead.</p>
<p><strong>t-bird</strong>: And Gideon’s just burned all the down to the
foundation.</p>
<p><strong>t-bird</strong>: I didn’t have nothin to do with that.</p>
<p><strong>top dollar</strong>: Bet that pisses you off, right?</p>
<p><strong>t-bird</strong>: Top, what the fuck is going on tonight?</p>
<p><strong>top dollar</strong>: Stay normal, T. Cops’ll be all hotwired
and aggressive. No combat moves until I check this out.</p>
<p><strong>elly</strong>: What are you supposed to be? A clown?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>elly</strong>: You look like a rock star without a job.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I dabble. May I?</p>
<p><strong>elly</strong>: If you’re not some kinda child molester.</p>
<p><strong>top dollar</strong>: I thought Halloween was tomorrow
night.</p>
<p><strong>top dollar</strong>: Get outta my way, you mooks.</p>
<p><strong>lao</strong>: An unexpected pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>top dollar</strong>: Bad news. Alot of action on the streets
tonight, and nobody bothered to clear it with me. Tin- Tin got himself
whacked.</p>
<p><strong>lao</strong>: Who got himself what?</p>
<p><strong>top dollar</strong>: One of mine. And it wasn’t a standard
hit.</p>
<p><strong>lao</strong>: I had heard something like this. Describe it
for me. The “hit”.</p>
<p><strong>top dollar</strong>: I was wondering if you could tell me
anything… about a wildcat operative.</p>
<p><strong>lao</strong>: I know of no one. But even if there is, I am
sure it is nothing outside your capacity to deal with?</p>
<p><strong>top dollar</strong>: Anybody violates my turf – our turf –
I’ll rip out there heart and show it to ’em.</p>
<p><strong>lao</strong>: To be sure. Now tell how your friend died.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: Annie?</p>
<p><strong>annabella</strong>: Whatever it is, the answer’s no, Eddie.
I’m too busy tonight.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: Annie, I need a file.</p>
<p><strong>annabella</strong>: Speak up. Clear it with the Captain if
you need a file.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: This is special, darlin’. Please?</p>
<p><strong>annabella</strong>: Just don’t tell me you “owe me one.” What
file?</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: Double homicide. A year ago. Las
Halloween.</p>
<p><strong>elly</strong>: My mom works over there. I’m waiting for her,
but she’s probably with him, right now.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>elly</strong>: Mister Funboy.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Mister Funboy lives there?</p>
<p><strong>elly</strong>: He has a room, upstairs. I don’t like him very
much.</p>
<p><strong>elly</strong>: Can you play that thing or do you just carry
it around everywhere?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I can pick out a tune now and again.</p>
<p><strong>elly</strong>: Can you play “Teddy Bears’ Picnic?” It used to
be her favorite.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Does she have a name?</p>
<p><strong>elly</strong>: No name. You sure ask a lot of questions.</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: Elly and SHelly sitting as SHelly’s vanity,
goofing with makeup, test-driving lipstick, the doll visible on the
vanity.</p>
<p><strong>elly</strong>: Hel-lo? Earth to anybody…?</p>
<p><strong>elly</strong>: Do you feel okay.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>elly</strong>: You gotta go now, I bet.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I have to go.</p>
<p><strong>grange</strong>: Top Dollar?</p>
<p><strong>bounce</strong>: Never heard of him.</p>
<p><strong>grange</strong>: Funboy?</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: Oh, prob’ly upstairs bangin’ Darla. Pay for
your own beer and they’ll prob’ly be down before you can drink it.</p>
<p><strong>annabella</strong>: Don’t thank me. Your ass is already in
enough trouble for this shit.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: I knew that.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: Another nice white girl with a cause. Like
a big KICK ME sign.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: Shelly Webster. And her nice white
boyfriend, Eric Draven.</p>
<p><strong>annabella</strong>: Your last little wild goose chase got you
busted back to the Beat Patrol, just like in a bad detective story,
Eddie. Are we doing the wildgoose thing again?</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: Could be.</p>
<p><strong>annabella</strong>: You gonna wind up working at a school
crosswalk. that doughnut’s chocolate you, know.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: Well, hello there…chocolate,</p>
<p><strong>annabella</strong>: Don’t thank me.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: Thanks, babe.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: It’s a Raymond Chandler evening And the
pavements are all wet, And I’m lurking in the shadows, for it hasn’t
happened …</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: … yet.</p>
<p><strong>angle</strong>: Funboy taps up a vein in Darla’s arm and
shoots her up. Both are naked in a shabby bed. Bare lightbulb above.</p>
<p><strong>darla</strong>: Ooh, baby – gimme all of it.</p>
<p><strong>darla</strong>: It’s a big fucking bird…</p>
<p><strong>funboy</strong>: It’s a squab. Here bird, Here, birdie…</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Here Funboy.</p>
<p><strong>funboy</strong>: Oh wow, oh wow, don’t fucking do that, man.
I nearly had a fucking heart attack.</p>
<p><strong>darla</strong>: Fun – look at that guy…</p>
<p><strong>funboy</strong>: It’s just the dope, don’t worry</p>
<p><strong>darla</strong>: Fun, he’s not going away; he’s scaring the
piss outta me!</p>
<p><strong>funboy</strong>: Not me.</p>
<p><strong>funboy</strong>: Time for you to take your bird and leave,
freako.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Take your shot funboy. You got me, dead
bang.</p>
<p><strong>funboy</strong>: You are seriously fucked up, man. Just look
at yourself.</p>
<p><strong>funboy</strong>: BANG! He shoots, he scores!</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Bull’s eye. Good shot.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Stay.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Morphine is bad for you.</p>
<p><strong>funboy</strong>: How the hell did you do that?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Magic.</p>
<p><strong>funboy</strong>: Either die or do a solo.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Neither.</p>
<p><strong>funboy</strong>: Yeah, I got a more fun idea myself.</p>
<p><strong>funboy</strong>: I hate trespassers! I hate prowlers! I hate
peeping toms! And right now I hate you!</p>
<p><strong>funboy</strong>: Ahh, the hell with it, I still got five
shots left.</p>
<p><strong>funboy</strong>: Owwwaaaa – fuck me! Look what you did to my
sheets, you lame piece’a shit! AAAAaa! Goddd!</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Does it hurt?</p>
<p><strong>funboy</strong>: Does it hurt?! You dead-ass, clown-faced
fuck, of course it fucking hurts! What the shit are you gonna do about
this?!</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I have some pain killer right here.</p>
<p><strong>funboy</strong>: No, wait, no WAIT, that’s too much, man,
that’s like overkill, nobody can take that much, you’re wasting it –
!</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Your pain ends now.</p>
<p><strong>skull cowboy</strong>: Howdy You look a mess. Like an ole
cooter dog.</p>
<p><strong>skull cowboy</strong>: Getting a little ambitious and
extracurricular, aren’t we?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Go away.</p>
<p><strong>skull cowboy</strong>: You need to learn to mind your own
business or you’ll never get where you think you’re going.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>skull cowboy</strong>: Maybe I was wrong about you.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Your daughter is out there, on the street,
waiting for you.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Go. Now.</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: Hey, g’night, Darla. That there is
Darla.</p>
<p><strong>grange</strong>: Funboy?</p>
<p><strong>nb</strong>: Eric has got a new black rock-n-roll shirt on…
and a shell casing from Funboy’s gun tied in his hair.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Freeze.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: Jeezus! Don’t ever do that, man!</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: I told you cops don’t say “freeze”.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: You, my friend, are dead. I saw your body.
You got buried.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I saw it, too.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Walk with me.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: You died, man. I can’t believe it but here
you are. Last year, you and your girlfriend –</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I need you to tell me what you remember. What
happened to us?</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: You went out the window. She was beaten
and raped. She died in the hospital.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: Hey, you asked, man. She held on for
thirty hours in intensive care. Hemorrhage, trauma. He body just finally
gave it up. I saw it and couldn’t do jack for her.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: You okay, man? I mean, what just
happened.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: The venom of bad memories. You were there; you
saw her. I saw you seeing her.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: You gotta understand – I was hoping she’d
talk, give me a lead, a clue, something to work with. But she only said
one thing to me before she died.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: My name.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: I’m sorry as hell, man.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Thirty hours. A day of life, plus change…</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Halloween is coming, soon. You will have Top
Dollar if you watch for me at the Showtime, tomorrow night.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: I should be trying to stop you.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Thank you. For giving a damn.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: My pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Don’t smoke these.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: Damn, I wish he wouldn’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>grange</strong>: The son of a bitch winked at me. The he
jumped. Three stories.</p>
<p><strong>lao</strong>: Did you see an animal of any kind? Did you see
a bird?</p>
<p><strong>grange</strong>: No. I saw a guitar. This isn’t some
rock-n-roller you forgot to pay, is it? There was a drawing on the wall
that looked like a bird. In blood.</p>
<p><strong>lao</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>skank</strong>: I wish to hell I had torched Gideon’s, that
fat fuck.</p>
<p><strong>t-bird</strong>: I wish to hell I knew who it was that made
Tin-Tin into a voodoo doll last night.</p>
<p><strong>t-bird</strong>: We need some smokes and some road beers.</p>
<p><strong>skank</strong>: Got it.</p>
<p><strong>t-bird</strong>: What the fuck are you supposed to be,
man?!</p>
<p><strong>inserts</strong>: Eric liberates T-Bird’s automatic from the
shoulder holster; Eric’s hand closes T-Bird’s door for him.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I’m your passenger. You drive. And stop
talking.</p>
<p><strong>skank</strong>: What’s all this happy horseshit?</p>
<p><strong>axel</strong>: Alright, alright, alright – everybody be cool
and stay exactly where you are.</p>
<p><strong>chopper</strong>: Whooooa, cowboy! Cool gun.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Faster, T-Bird. Faster. You’re a hell of a
wheelman; you know you can drive faster.</p>
<p><strong>t-bird</strong>: You call it, blood – you got the gun. You
just tell me where you want to go.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: That’s good. We’re going someplace you’ve
never been before.</p>
<p><strong>mj</strong>: Smells like rain.</p>
<p><strong>speeg</strong>: Smells like a septic tank. You got that cream
stuff?</p>
<p><strong>mj</strong>: In the bag.</p>
<p><strong>speeg</strong>: I hate this cream stuff. They can’t even call
it cream, legally.</p>
<p><strong>mj</strong>: What in the crap?</p>
<p><strong>speeg</strong>: Ow! Owowoowowoowo, goddammit!</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: You caught one. Drive faster.</p>
<p><strong>t-bird</strong>: Man, you gonna get us killed dead and I
don’t even know what you want!</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I want you to stop talking. And drive. Drive
faster.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: You’re very popular. Thought you could handle
this thing.</p>
<p><strong>t-bird</strong>: To hell with you.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Naturally.</p>
<p><strong>t-bird</strong>: So what – you gonna rape me now?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Time for your reward, T. Payback with interest
earned.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: A little restrictive? Good. You held her down
and raped her. You were the first. She burned while you were inside of
her. What’s the lag on this? About twenty seconds, would you say?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I’ve comrades in hell, T-bird. Give them my
best.</p>
<p><strong>intercuts</strong>: as the car speeds for the water’s edge,
Eric thumbs bullets from the clip, one by one.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: All gone.</p>
<p><strong>darla</strong>: I never was too good at this domestic
shit.</p>
<p><strong>elly</strong>: Don’t say “shit”. That’s okay. Corn Flakes are
okay. Anything.</p>
<p><strong>irate voice</strong>: Hey, shut the fuck up!</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Chili dog for breakfast… it’s original.</p>
<p><strong>elly</strong>: Mom tried to cook.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>customer</strong>: Hey, Mickey, I need a special with
everything. No sawdust.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Everyone’s a comedian. Enjoy.</p>
<p><strong>grange</strong>: You’re Elly, right? I know your mom.</p>
<p><strong>elly</strong>: A lot of people “know” my mom.</p>
<p><strong>grange</strong>: I know your friend, too – the one that looks
like a rock star.</p>
<p><strong>elly</strong>: I don’t know you.</p>
<p><strong>grange</strong>: I’d like to get in touch with him.</p>
<p><strong>elly</strong>: You’re not a cop, either. What do you want him
for?</p>
<p><strong>grange</strong>: I’m looking for a good guitar man.</p>
<p><strong>elly</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>elly</strong>: You buying? He kinda wanders around. You’ll
see him if you pay attention.</p>
<p><strong>grange</strong>: I need to find him kind of soon, Elly.</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: Shelly stands in the blue moonlight near the
picture window wearing a rococo Victorian gown. PUSH IN TIGHT as she is
embraced by a nude Eric. He undoes the last few remaining ties that hold
the gown in place. FOLLOW THE GOWN as it crumples down the length of
Shelly’s body to the floor…</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: Eric and Shelly , exchange an extremely
passionate and intimate KISS in the moonlight.</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: A series of CLOSE SHOTS of Eric and Shelly’s
HANDS, each moving along the other’s body. Curves and dips and contours.
But Eric’s gaze never leaves SHelly’s eyes.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: That’s better.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: It’s almost time.</p>
<p><strong>skank</strong>: Top, I made the sumbitch! Face all painted
white like some kinda fuckin’ kabuki homo!</p>
<p><strong>lao</strong>: Sounds like our “Crow” is out-maneuvering
you.</p>
<p><strong>top dollar</strong>: “Our” Crow…?</p>
<p><strong>lao</strong>: Come now. You’ve seen the graffiti – all over
the city in the few hors it has taken your men to drop like plague
victims. What about your turf, Top? You don’t seem to have ripped out
anyone’s heart yet.</p>
<p><strong>top dollar</strong>: The night is young.</p>
<p><strong>skank</strong>: The found T-bird flash-fried to what was left
of his fucking car!</p>
<p><strong>top dollar</strong>: Hey, you little fuckweed! That’s against
the law!</p>
<p><strong>top dollar</strong>: I don’t give a shit what kinda bird this
guy is.</p>
<p><strong>lao</strong>: I am sitting over here.</p>
<p><strong>lao</strong>: Do you think this childish machismo impresses
me? When I was a boy in Saigon I watched my country change one block at
a time, one building at a time. Whole lives erased. A way of life,
polluted. Today, no one forces me to move. I use my powers to change
your country, one block at a time, one building at a time.</p>
<p><strong>top dollar</strong>: Nice speech. What’s it supposed to
mean?</p>
<p><strong>lao</strong>: Your comprehension is not required. Your
cooperation and, indeed, your ability are the issues on the table.</p>
<p><strong>top dollar</strong>: Whatever you say, I can do.</p>
<p><strong>lao</strong>: That’s reassuring.</p>
<p><strong>skank</strong>: What was that – !?</p>
<p><strong>top dollar</strong>: Too many poppers, Skank. Relax.
Heel.</p>
<p><strong>top dollar</strong>: You want my attention, man you got
it.</p>
<p><strong>skank</strong>: It’s him, Top! He dusted T-Bird!</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: You have to be SKank. One moment.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Thank of a snappy comeback for me on your way
down.</p>
<p><strong>mj</strong>: OwwwAAHHH son of a BITCH!</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: Jesus Christ…</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Top Dollar, you’re the only one here still
wasting good air…</p>
<p><strong>top dollar</strong>: Five large, in the drawer right over
there. I never saw you.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Do you know what you destroyed?</p>
<p><strong>top dollar</strong>: Take the dope, too.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: A year ago. A very nice lady circulated a
petition. She died. Last Halloween. Answer yes or no.</p>
<p><strong>top dollar</strong>: That’s ancient history.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: It’s yesterday! Do you know what you
destroyed?</p>
<p><strong>top dollar</strong>: Who gives a fuck! I’m a businessman. You
gonna do me, then do me and shut you’re face!</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: You don’t even remember…</p>
<p><strong>top dollar</strong>: I never forget anything, dickhead. That
building was a sweep-and- clear; the bitch was a nuisance with her
goddamned petition. It got a little rowdy… end of story.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Rowdy. Let me fill in some gaps for you.</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: Shelly backing away from oncoming Funboy in
the loft, trying to retreat, nowhere to run, her home invaded,
scared.</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: Shelly cut, bleeding, struggling against
T-Bird. Wild.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: You’re a detail man, Top – you need to see
more.</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: Shelly, comatose in ICU, eyes fixed and
staring, hoses darting in and out, cold blue refrigerator light.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: All of her pain, Top. Thirty hours. All at
once…</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: …all for you.</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: Rapidfire CLOSE-UPS. A jagged compound
fracture, jutting, Shelly’s eye, blood-red sclera, purpled and
sunken.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I didn’t think you could handle it either.</p>
<p><strong>lead swat</strong>: That’s all she wrote, Bozo! You stand
down now, and that’s an order!</p>
<p><strong>lead swat</strong>: The fire escape’s covered.</p>
<p><strong>team leader</strong>: On the roof! Keep firing! Keep
firing!</p>
<p><strong>lead swat</strong>: Holy shit, it’s spiderman.</p>
<p><strong>lead swat</strong>: What’re you boy scouts staring at! Let’s
Go! Let’s go! Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>chopper pilot</strong>: He’s off the roof. We can’t see
him.</p>
<p><strong>lead swat</strong>: Dammit to hell! Come on.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: Come on!</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: Keep your head down!</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: I figured you might need a ride home.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: It’s done.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: I figured as much. Did you cap off
Funboy.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Funboy had to leave this mortal coil.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: Yeah, among others. Hey, man – you’re
hit.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: It’s only a flesh wound.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: It’s only fourteen or fifteen flesh
wounds.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: You shouldn’t smoke these.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: Great. Litterbug of the Living Dead.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I’m finished.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I mean, I’ve done what I came to do. It
shouldn’t hurt this much. But it will pass…</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: Right. You sure I can’t just take you to
the emergency ward?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: They couldn’t do anything for me.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: How ’bout the morgue?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: No. I have one more thing to do.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: You’re gonna kill somebody else. We’re
gonna stop and get a shit-load of Band-Aids?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I have to prepare for an anniversary. This
coming night.</p>
<p><strong>grange</strong>: What… the hell is that?</p>
<p><strong>lao</strong>: This is a cobra, Mr. Grange. Yes, it is
real.</p>
<p><strong>grange</strong>: That thing is poisonous.</p>
<p><strong>lao</strong>: Extremely so. You and I are the recipients of
unwanted good fortune, in the form of a man everyone is calling The
Crow.</p>
<p><strong>grange</strong>: Give me a break. That guy’s a wacko…</p>
<p><strong>lao</strong>: I intend no slight to you, but I cannot find
the English to adequately express just what he is. I suppose Western
mythology would describe him as a Fury.</p>
<p><strong>grange</strong>: Not a Plymouth Fury, I bet.</p>
<p><strong>lao</strong>: Do you know of spirit assassins? You do know
the dead can rise? Properly motivated, of course.</p>
<p><strong>grange</strong>: Like some sort of zombie on a revenge
trip.</p>
<p><strong>lao</strong>: Mmm. But tonight I can take what is his.</p>
<p><strong>grange</strong>: Only thing you’ll get from that clown is a
faster way to die.</p>
<p><strong>lao</strong>: To the contrary…</p>
<p><strong>lao</strong>: …all the dying tonight will be done by the
former Eric Draven.</p>
<p><strong>lao</strong>: Who is only invulnerable so long as he cares
about the dead. When he begins to care about the living, you’ll find his
heart can bleed… and I want it to bleed for me.</p>
<p><strong>grange</strong>: Kill a dead guy?</p>
<p><strong>lao</strong>: Truly kill him. So I may crush his skull and
smoke it.</p>
<p><strong>lao</strong>: Let it suffice that I need him… and to get to
him, we’ll need his little friend.</p>
<p><strong>elly</strong>: What’s going on…?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: A remembrance. A closure.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Better now. I feel good. How are you, Elly, my
friend?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>elly</strong>: I knew. I knew I knew you. Even with the
makeup and stuff you wore. You really loved her, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: You brought flowers. As long as you don’t
forget her, Elly, she lives.</p>
<p><strong>elly</strong>: She’s dead. She’s gone. And now you’re just
gonna go away and never come back, too. I hate this place; it isn’t
fair.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Elly…</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Sometimes the people we care about are gone,
for no reason. Sometimes that’s really tough. I cry. But if the people
we love are gone, we keep them –</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: – right here. It’s a big responsibility. And
that makes it okay to mourn. I know that if you weren’t here, I’d be
very sad.</p>
<p><strong>elly</strong>: You look funny without your white face on.
Like it’s your day off or something.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Somebody here wants to meet you. Gabriel?</p>
<p><strong>elly</strong>: I remember him! Here, Gabriel… here kitty…
Gabriel… Is he still yours?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I think he’s yours, now.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I have something else for you.</p>
<p><strong>elly</strong>: Nobody ever gave me something like that
before. Ever.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Shelly would’ve wanted you to have it. This
way, you’ll think of her every time you see it…</p>
<p><strong>elly</strong>: And she’ll be alive. Up here.</p>
<p><strong>elly</strong>: You’re gonna like it here.</p>
<p><strong>darla</strong>: I was wonderin’ where you’d gotten to – Oh,
Elly, honey, a cat. Here?</p>
<p><strong>elly</strong>: He was a present. Besides, we’re moving
anyway. You said.</p>
<p><strong>darla</strong>: We’ll discuss this later. Obviously. You left
the door open.</p>
<p><strong>grange</strong>: Hi, Elly. Remember me?</p>
<p><strong>darla</strong>: I don’t remember you. And I don’t remember
inviting…</p>
<p><strong>grange</strong>: If she opens her face again, shoot her in
the head.</p>
<p><strong>elly</strong>: Mom – !</p>
<p><strong>grange</strong>: You should listen to your mother. She said
no cats.</p>
<p><strong>elly</strong>: Gabriel!</p>
<p><strong>grange</strong>: Now that’s the expression I want.</p>
<p><strong>grange</strong>: Say cheese.</p>
<p><strong>creature kid</strong>: Trick or treat!</p>
<p><strong>skull cowboy</strong>: Stop screwing around.</p>
<p><strong>skull cowboy</strong>: Your job is done. You interfere with
the living again.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Tell me I’ll get hurt. That I might die. I’ve
already done that. I don’t need anyone’s help. Yours included.</p>
<p><strong>skull cowboy</strong>: Do this thing and you will be
vulnerable. The blood will not return. No powers. No reunion.
Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Fine with me.</p>
<p><strong>skull cowboy</strong>: You’ll be alone.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I’m already alone.</p>
<p><strong>grange</strong>: We’ve got company.</p>
<p><strong>lao</strong>: Is he inside?</p>
<p><strong>grange</strong>: He’s just out front talking to himself. You
tell me.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Don’t waste my time.</p>
<p><strong>skull cowboy</strong>: Very well, it’s your ass.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: But why are you still here?</p>
<p><strong>lao</strong>: I believe our friend Elly call you Mister Crow.
Please acknowledge; the mike will pick you up.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I can see her.</p>
<p><strong>lao</strong>: Of course you can. ANGLE - GRANGE IN THE
GALLERY – in darkness. The running lights on his night-scoped,
laser-sighted sniper’s rifle which THROWS vague sprays of eerie red and
green light.</p>
<p><strong>lao</strong>: Don’t permit your rage to cloud the issue. I
believe in barter. I propose a simple trade.</p>
<p><strong>lao</strong>: You intended to finish this evening in the
cemetery. I am here to help you on your way.</p>
<p><strong>grange</strong>: I’ve got him if you want him.</p>
<p><strong>lao</strong>: No shooting.</p>
<p><strong>grange</strong>: Move in, guys.</p>
<p><strong>lao</strong>: I wish to possess what you have now.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I want the girl. Unharmed. Now.</p>
<p><strong>lao</strong>: I know. That is why I will prevail. Mr. Grange…
?</p>
<p><strong>lao</strong>: Sooner or later, my action were destined to
bring me a genuine Fury. And it turned out to be you. At last. I
appreciate your abilities as few mortals can. That’s why I desire
them.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: You’re too late. There was a guy outside - on
the stairs - you really need to talk to. But he turned to dust and blew
away. I don’t have any power for you to take.</p>
<p><strong>lao</strong>: I don’t believe that. Lao motions to Grange
with the killing blade. Grange RELAXES his deathgrip on the crow. MOVE
IN CLOSE on Eric so we may perceive a palpable degree of relief.</p>
<p><strong>lao</strong>: Time for you to die for me. Funny, how the dead
can still bleed. How they need air.</p>
<p><strong>lao</strong>: Break its neck.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: Had to go get yourself hip-deep in shit,
didn’t you, my friend.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: Give it a rest, huh?</p>
<p><strong>lao</strong>: I said no shooting!</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: You sorta looked like you might need my
help.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: This isn’t your place. This isn’t your fight.
And I don’t need your help.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: You’re welcome.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Leave here. Don’t do this. I don’t want you
here.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: The hell you say. This isn’t just about
you any more.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Don’t interfere.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: You’re bleeding, man. You can’t make
it.</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: You won’t mind if I just take the stairs,
then, smartass…</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Here I am.</p>
<p><strong>lao</strong>: Can you fly, Crow man?</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: I ain’t cut out for this superhero
shit.</p>
<p><strong>lao</strong>: Face me!</p>
<p><strong>albrecht</strong>: Is he dead yet?</p>
<p><strong>lao</strong>: No. You are.</p>
<p><strong>lao</strong>: You’ve caused another death, Mister Draven! The
girl will die as well – because of you!</p>
<p><strong>elly</strong>: You go to hell, you pervert!</p>

you know where to come.</p>
<p><strong>elly</strong>: You mean you’ll, like’ dig your way out of the
grave? Euww.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: For you, I’ll try. Promise.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Leave me now.</p>
