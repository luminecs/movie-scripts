<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Come on, come on, again.</p>
<p><strong>jigsaw</strong>: Rise and shine, Adam. You�re probably
wondering where you are. I�ll tell you where you might be. You might be
in the room that you die in. Up until now, you simply sat in the
shadows, watching others live out their lives. But what do voyeurs see
when they look into the mirror? Now, I see you as a strange mix of
someone angry and yet apathetic. But mostly just pathetic. So are you
going to watch yourself die today, Adam? Or do something about it?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I don�t get it.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Throw me the player.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: No, you throw me your tape.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: slow-minded fool who simply doesn�t
understand the full capacity of the situation that they�re in, and
speaks Look, we�re going to have to work together if we want to get out
of here. Now just throw it to me.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I�m not going to risk breaking it! You throw
me your tape!</p>
<p><strong>jigsaw</strong>: Dr. Gordon, this is your wake up call. Every
day of your working life, you have given people the news that they are
going to die soon. Now you will be the cause of death. Your aim in this
game is to kill Adam. glances down at the tape recorder wide-eyed, You
have until six on the clock to do it. There� sa man in the room with
you. When there�s that much poison in your blood , the only thing left
to do is shoot yourself. There are ways to win this hidden all around
you. Just remember: X marks the spot for the treasure. If you do not
kill Adam by 6:00, then Alison and Diana will die, Dr. Gordon. And I�ll
leave you in this room to rot. Let the game begin.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Give me that. Now. him the tape. He
catches it, rewinds, plays back. Adam stands up from his</p>
<p><strong>jigsaw</strong>: …then Alison and Diana will die, Dr. Gordon.
And I�ll leave you in this room to rot.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Any idea who that is?</p>
<p><strong>jigsaw</strong>: Let the game begin.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: He knows us.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Wait a minute.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: What do you think? Probably a joke, right?</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Shh, shh!</p>
<p><strong>jigsaw</strong>: Let the game begin.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Listen…</p>
<p><strong>jigsaw</strong>: …Follow your heart.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: What the hell does Follow your heart mean?</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: There! Right next to you, on the
toilet.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Come on, come on.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Oh man… his face turned away from the bowl. He
coughs, fishes around for another brief moment, then quickly pulls back,
trying to shake some of the shit off of his hand, spitting.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Anything?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: No solids.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Take off the lid. lid. Adam looks to it,
slowly stands up, reaches for it. Lawrence has no Come on!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I really wish I had checked in there
first.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Huh. What is it?</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Hey! Mind passing me the other one?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Fuck! Fuck! hitting the broken saw twice
against the iron pipe then turns and hums it across the room, right into
a mirror. A small piece of the mirror breaks off</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: He doesn�t want us to cut through our
chains. He wants us to cut through our feet. I think I may know who�s
done this to us.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: It�s not someone I know personally.
It�s…just someone I know of.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Jesus Christ! Tell me, who is it?!</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: The last I heard…the police still hadn�t
caught him.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: And the only reason I know that is because
I was a suspect.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: I�ll start from the beginning.</p>

back of the cage and tunneled his way through the razor wire so fast

chilling</p>
<p><strong>jigsaw</strong>: Hello Paul. You are a perfectly healthy,
sane, middle-class male. Yet last month, you ran a straight razor across
your wrists. Did you cut yourself because you truly wanted to die, or
did you just want some attention? Tonight, you�ll show me. The irony is
that if you want to die, you just have to stay where you are. But if you
want to live, you�ll have to cut yourself again. shot of Paul waking up
in the cage, looking around, scared and confused. The shots go back and
forth between the detectives and the Paul flashback, with him grabbing
and shaking the razor wire, screaming. His screams sound distant Find
the path through the razor wire to the door. But hurry. At 3:00 that
door will lock and then this room becomes your tomb. How much blood will
you shed to stay alive, Paul?</p>

Jigsaw Killer.</p>

really a murderer. He never killed anyone.</p>

themselves.</p>

brown hair. He is completely nude, smeared in some kind of Vaseline-like
ointment. In front of him is a small, square glass plate held up by some

and a box of matches. He gets up, looking around confusedly Right now,
there is a slow-acting poison in your veins. The antidote is in the

screaming, his screams distant under Jigsaw�s voice, The combination to

<p><strong>tapp</strong>: We�d like to ask you a few questions about it.
For your sake, I think it�s best if we do it down at the station. Would
you like to follow us there?</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: No, I�m afraid that�s…that�s quite out of
the question. I can�t just leave, I have work to do. Plus, my wife has

lawyer gets frustrated, noisily puts Look, if you can�t be honest with
me…</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: I was visiting someone. It wasn�t a
patient. Alright? What am I gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: Well, as your lawyer and your friend, my
advice to you is to bite the bullet and give them your alibi now.
Because no one is going to believe you later.</p>

me up for murder.</p>

a table. This is AMANDA. Lawrence and Sing can see her Want to know if
you wouldn�t mind sticking around and listening to her testimony? Maybe
it�ll trigger something. and an unidentified bald black man in a suit

against the wall. Tapp sits in a</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: I�d like to help, really, but…</p>
<p><strong>sing</strong>: Well, we�d really appreciate it. She�s the
only one who made it.</p>

She pulls against her bonds, moaning loudly, trying to speak or cry out
but And metal.</p>
<p><strong>jigsaw</strong>: Hello Amanda. You don�t know me, but I know
you. I want to play a game. Here�s what happens if you lose. a device
like the one she�s wearing attached to a mannequin head. As he
continues, explaining what it is, her breathing grows faster and
heavier, The device you�re wearing is hooked into your upper and lower
jaws. When the timer at the back goes off, your mouth will be
permanently ripped open. Think of it like a reverse bear trap. Here,
I�ll show you.</p>
<p><strong>jigsaw</strong>: There is only one key to open the device.
It�s in the stomach of your dead cellmate. Look around, Amanda. Know
that I�m not lying. You better hurry up. Live or die. Make your
choice.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: And then I saw the body.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: There was a knife.</p>
<p><strong>sing</strong>: He�d been injected with an opiate overdose. He
couldn�t move or feel much of anything.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: You mean….he was alive?</p>
<p><strong>sing</strong>: Was.</p>
<p><strong>tapp</strong>: What happened after you took it off?</p>
<p><strong>jigsaw</strong>: Congratulations. You are still alive. Most
people are so ungrateful to be alive. But not you. Not anymore.</p>
<p><strong>tapp</strong>: You are, in fact, a drug addict. Isn�t that
right, Mandy? Do you think that is why he picked you? Are you grateful,
Mandy?</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: He…helped me.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Are you sure it�s him?</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Yeah, I�m sure.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: How do I know you�re telling the truth? You
can be the one who put me in this room! gesticulates as he speaks,
pointing</p>

<p><strong>adam</strong>: You just want to leave it running on us?</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Well, you won�t stop it. That�s why we
can�t cut through these chains. It�s why you won�t break that glass.
Every possible angle has been pre-thought out by him. deep in thought,

she places her hands on her Diana, Honey, can you hear me?</p>

<p><strong>alison</strong>: Oh, what is it, sweet pea?</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: There�s a man in my room.</p>

in your imagination?</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: He talked to me.</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: Okay, I�ll come and check your room.</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: I want Daddy. He�ll get the scary man.</p>

thing he�d expected What are you talking about? You mean, leave you and
Mommy? nods; he reaches up and gently brushes No, no sweetheart, I would
never do that. Who gave you that idea?</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: No one.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Well it�s not true, okay?</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: Okay.</p>

and takes out his wallet, throws it across the room to Adam, who is
sitting with his back against the wall, facing Lawrence. Adam picks up
the wallet and opens it. He sees two pictures of Diana, side by side.
The one on the left is Diana hugging a dog. The one on the right is a
smiling portrait outside somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: She�s beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: You gonna have any more kids?</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: We�ve talked about it, but uh, with our
schedules, it�s difficult enough to concentrate on one. that maybe he�s
starting to realize that he should�ve spent more time and</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: So where�s the lucky wife?</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: There�s another picture behind the one
you�re looking at. the photo on the right and pulls another photograph
out. Lawrence smiles slightly It�s my favourite one because we�re all in
it together. Someone, usually me, has to hold the camera, which means
I�m always missing from the photos.</p>

<p><strong>adam</strong>: Yeah. hand, he shifts slightly by lifting
himself a bit with his right hand, sneakily putting the photograph down
and tossing the wallet with his left hand. Lawrence picks up the wallet
and starts looking for it, creasing his brow in concern, while Adam
backs up against his wall, holding the photograph out of Lawrence�s
sight against a pipe he rests his arm</p>

something down, gets his briefcase ready to go to work. Alison stands a
few feet behind him, trying her best to get him to react,</p>

break down and tell me that you hated me. At least there�d be some
passion in it.</p>

figure covered by a blanket looming over Diana�s bed. The figure
suddenly grabs Diana and she screams, struggling against him. Alison
goes for them.</p>

her!</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: Keep your motherfucking hands off of my
daughter!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Who are you little man…I see you… a
television screen with the video of Zep in the window. Fade back and to
the right as we get a view of someone�s apartment. Plastered on the
walls are various photographs, which we can barely make out, and a desk
in the corner with some recording equipment. As we move further right
and hit the window we see Detective Tapp, leaning over the camera
shooting the Gordon�s window, adjusting the view. Something about him
seems just not right. We cut back Does Dr. Gordon know you�re at home
with his wife? I know you know something. What are you doing in there?
Waiting for the doctor? I�m waiting for the doctor, too. Hmm.</p>

like to play with kids a bit too much. He lived two blocks from here.
The sewer lines run under this neighborhood too, Doctor.</p>

emergencies that occurred there in the last two weeks. Go, right now!
Mmm!</p>

voiceover. As he speaks, there�s a brief shot of the two of them sitting
over the map, then quick shots of a few black and white photographs of a
warehouse, including a close up of a street sign Stygian St.</p>
<p><strong>sing</strong>: On the night of Tuesday, the 17th, we got a
fire alarm going off in the rear wing of 213 Stygian Street. It�s an old
listing. Used to be a mannequin factory. You think we have enough for a
warrant, though?</p>

his coat, and quickly follows Tapp.</p>

it came from, but sees nothing. He looks around him for another moment,

Adam. Adam is just standing there, staring at him. Something seems a
bit…off. With a suspicious tone, Lawrence addresses How did you know to
turn off the lights?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Who cares? It worked.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Yeah, but how did you know?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Instinct.</p>

his head and upper body forward, holding his head</p>

sniffling and crying for a moment. Then, Okay…okay.. Okay, I�ve got to
think now…</p>
<p><strong>jigsaw</strong>: Think about this…you don�t need a gun to
kill Adam. When there�s that much poison in your blood moving to the
pool of blood from the , the only thing left to do is shoot
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Hey! What the hell are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Adam, listen to me. I want you to play
along with me on this.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: You got that? on, both of them again
wincing at the bright light. Lawrence glances at the surveillance
camera, then looks to Adam.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: So you uh, still want that cigarette?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Um…yeah, sure.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: There! I�ve done it! I�ve killed him with
the poison, just like you wanted. Now where�s my family?! Where are
they?!</p>

<p><strong>adam</strong>: now he�s pissed at Lawrence for his You think
I would make that up just to mess up your stupid fucking charade?</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: All right, that�s it! and picks up his
saw, sits down and starts trying to saw through his chains again,
grunting. Adam, in the meantime, just sits back against the wall,
breathing heavily, looking dazed. Lawrence continues to franticly saw,

Lawrence stands, staring at him in near disbelief. He has been caught.
Adam takes a handful of photos from the baggie he�d kept hidden inside

Lawrence leaving his house, glancing over his shoulder and moving down
the I watched you leave. I followed you photographs of the exterior of
the Hotel Barfly. Lawrence inside the hotel, knocking on the door to one
of the rooms while Adam hides around the corner with his all the way to
that shitbag hotel.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: You�ve uh, had these with you the whole
time?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I found them, in there toilet; quick flashback
of Adam pulling the bag out of the top of the toilet, then Adam opening
the bag and seeing the hacksaws and a glimpse of something with the
hacksaws. I don�t know how they got there.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Yeah, right. You�re so full of it!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Aww, face it, Larry, we�re both bulls hitters.
But my camera isn�t. It doesn�t know how to lie. It only shows you
what�s put right in front of it. Just out of curiosity, what did you do
in that motel room? You got out of there pretty fast.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Why did you um, deem it necessary to page

out the door.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Who was it?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Who was what?</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: The person who paid you to follow me, who
was it?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: He calls himself Bob and he gives me the money
up front. Two hundred bucks a night. If I�d have known I was gonna end
up here, I would�ve asked for a hell of a lot more.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: What does that mean? Does that mean you
saw what happened to me?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: What I saw was you get into your car. That�s
it. I didn�t ask your name. I didn�t know who you were. I don�t know how
I got here, I don�t know how you got here. I just took the shots he
speaks, a quick flashback of Adam taking a picture, going up apartment
and went straight home to develop the. Next thing I know I�m chained to
a pipe in some prehistoric bathroom, staring at the guy I�ve been taking
shots of all night.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Clearly, whoever paid you to take the
pictures of me is the one who put is in here.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Maybe? What do you mean maybe? Of course
it is! What did he look like?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I don�t know, he was just a guy. and an
unidentifiable figure towards the back of the room, the image darkened
so we can�t make him out. The figure</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Was he tall, was he skinny, obese,
what?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I don�t take notes about his appearance.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: You must remember something about him.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I can�t.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: You�re telling me you don�t remember a
thing about the guy?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I told you, I- figure moves closer, just about

<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Tapp! Tapp handing us/Adam money.
Adam�s/our hand reaches out and takes it quickly. Detective Tapp!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Whoa, the guy who paid me to take these photos
was not a cop.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: No, no, he was discharged from the police
force. He broke down after his partner was killed , but that didn�t stop
him from harassing me. The guy became obsessed. in his current apartment
adjusting the camera in the window, then a shot of him leaning over a
notebook, going over He�s convinced himself that I must have somehow
been involved with the murders. He�s…he�s crazy. at the corner desk in
his apartment, giving a crazy-sounding Heh heh heh laugh. The shot cuts
back to Lawrence, And you helped him. You took money from him to invade
my privacy. How could you do that?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Call it my need to eat.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Right, right. You know what Adam? You�re
not a victim of this game, you�re a part of it.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Oh really? Obviously this cop thinks you�re
the one behind it all.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: turning around slightly, internal eye I
told you, he�s not a cop. He�s a bottom feeder, just like you. sneer
from Lawrence at Adam. Lawrence</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: What are you more pissed off about? The fact
that I took some shots of you or the fact that I took some shots of you
while you were cheating on your wife?</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: I did not cheat on her!!!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: What do you care what I think anyway? I don�t
give a crap if you covered yourself in peanut butter and had a 15-hooker
gang bang!</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: How did I get here? down on the pipe in
his corner, leaning I had…I had everything in order. My whole life was
in perfect order.</p>

work behind her to loosen</p>

seeing you pay for this! You bastard fuck!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Look. his Zep rage, looks up. The clock reads

watching her, looking for an opportunity to overcome her once again. She
picks the phone up, still keeping her eyes Larry?</p>

<p><strong>zep</strong>: Mrs. Gordon? Diana?! I�m gonna kill your
husband now, Mrs. Gordon. over to the computer station, taking keys from
the desk and then hobbling down the hall and out the door. We see Tapp
groaning, starting to get up. Zep glances over and sees Tapp get to his
feet, but quickly hobbles to the doorway and out the door. Tapp starts
to follow, just a we bit dazed from the hit. He empties his gun
cartridge and replaces it, then runs towards the door, screaming.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Lawrence! out of Lawrence�s mouth as the
electrocution continues, and then a moment later stops. Adam watches,
frightened, unsure. Lawrence Lawrence, get up!</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Car Chase! Zep is in the lead, with Tapp in
hot pursuit behind him. They race through the streets as fast as they
can.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Lawrence! Get up! I need you! finds a piece of
debris on the floor, throws it at Lawrence. It doesn�t hit him. He leans
down, picks up another, throws it. This one bounces onto the floor but
ricochets and hits Lawrence, who begins to stir. A moment, and Lawrence
starts to move more, reaching for his head and sitting up. Adam cries
out Oh, thank God! I thought you were dead!</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: He…he electrocuted me…</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I told you! The same thing happened to me,
see? I wasn�t lying, see?</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: FUCK THIS SHIT!!</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: No!!!!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Lawrence, calm down. There must be a way out
of this! seems to be a complete role reversal for the two of them from
the beginning, where Adam was the one freaking out and Lawrence was
calm. Here, Adam is terrified but still calmer than Lawrence,</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: I can�t be calm! My family needs me! No,
God! still can�t get the phone. He quickly turns and sits up, grabbing
the chain and pulling it as he lets out a terrible scream of rage.
Adam�s hands are up clutching his head, trying to keep his</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Lawrence, I have a family too! I don�t see
them, that�s my mistake. It�s a mistake I�d like to fix!</p>
<p><strong>tapp</strong>: I�m gonna kill you you sick asshole!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Lawrence, stop it!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Lawrence, please calm down! There�s a way out
of here, there�s a way out!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Lawrence! No! Oh my God! What are you
doing?!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: What are you doing?!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: What are you… Lawrence�s intentions. His eyes
go wide,</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Oh my God! Oh my God! Lawrence don�t! No!
Lawrence, please, I�m begging you! Lawrence, it�s not me who did this to
you!</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: You have to die.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: moving side to side to try to throw No, I want
to live!</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: I�m sorry…</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I want to live!</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: My family… hitting Adam in the upper chest
area. Adam falls down forward onto the floor,</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: I�ve done it! Now show them to me!
continues to cry, dropping the gun next to him, collapsing back down
with his</p>
<p><strong>neighbor</strong>: Thank you very much, Officer.</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: Larry?</p>
<p><strong>neighbor</strong>: Did you get through to him?</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: There�s still no answer.</p>
<p><strong>neighbor</strong>: It�s all right. I�ve called the police.
Everything�s okay.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: You bastard! I�ll fucking kill you! but is
too weak and Zep pulls away, looking down at him, moving over to I�ll
fucking kill you! You fucking bastard! quickly cralws forwarrd and takes
up the gun, pulling the trigger several times, but there are no more
bullets. I�ll fucking kill you! You fucking bastard! I�ll fucking kill
you! I�ll fucking kill you!</p>
<p><strong>zep</strong>: You�re too late.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>zep</strong>: It�s the rules.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: You�re going to be all right. You�re just
wounded in the shoulder. I have to go and get help.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Don�t leave me! No!</p>
