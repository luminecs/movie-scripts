<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Name?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Gus Gorman.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Ah yes, August Gorman. Have you looked for
work this week, Mr. Gorman?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: What kind?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Kitchen. . . Technician</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Dishwasher? Any luck?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Nope, but –</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Mr. Gorman, according to our records you have
been unemployed for 36 weeks.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Thirty-five.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Not counting this week. You secured
employment last June as a messenger and were discharged after one day
for. . .</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: They said I lost it on the subway, but it ain’t
the truth! It was a pickpocket took it!</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: A television set?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Well, it was one of them little bitty two-inch
screen Japanese jobs.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: The only other employment you found was in a
fast-food joint– – which lasted. . . 28 minutes! Well! That’s some kind
of record. Talk about fast!</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Man, them people was crazy! How they ’spect you
to learn all that jive on the first day? “Hold the pickle! Hold the
lettuce! Extra onions! Special sauce! No special sauce!” Ain’t nobody
found no meat inside that glop yet.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Mr. Gorman, the city of Metropolis is
generous to a fault, but. . .</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: I know, I’m the fault.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Thirty-six weeks of chronic unemployment,
thirty-six weeks of living off the taxes of hard-working citizens. Do
you know what you are?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Don’t call me a bum! I ain’t no bum!</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: You are, I was about to say, no longer
eligible.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: What about this week’s check?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Hey brother, got a match?</p>
<p><strong>“earn big money.</strong>: BECOME A COMPUTER PROGRAMMER”</p>
<p><strong>hold on this tight c.u. of the matchbook and freeze
frame.</strong>: Music: The stirring Superman theme begins.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Way to go, Superman!</p>
<p><strong>first painter</strong>: Mike, looks who’s here!</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Oh! Sorry about that.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Neatness counts.</p>
<p><strong>first student</strong>: But what if you want to program two
bilateral coordinates at the same time?</p>
<p><strong>instructor</strong>: You can’t. It’s impossible.</p>
<p><strong>first student</strong>: Computer technology is quite
advanced, young man, but it can’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Uh. . .</p>
<p><strong>instructor</strong>: Good Lord! How did you do that?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Just did it, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Olsen, there’s one thing I don’t understand.
The point of the story Lois wrote is how the Ross Webster got this great
honor. You bring me one photograph of him and fifteen pictures of this
person!</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Who is she?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Her name’s Lorelei Ambrosia. She’s Webster’s
Girl Friday.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Oh, I think Saturday, too.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Who’s the other woman?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: That’s his sister. Vera Webster.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: The picture looks blurry.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: The picture’s fine. That’s the way she looks
in real life.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: You’re amazing, Olsen. A boring banquet and
you bring back 3,000 boring pictures. Then Superman puts out a fire on
Third Avenue this morning and you stand there and watch the whole thing
and you don’t take one picture!!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I didn’t have my camera with me.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: A photographer eats with his camera, A
Photographer sleeps with his camera –</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Glad I’m a writer.</p>
<p><strong>miss henderson</strong>: Mr. White, please, it’s time for you
to draw this month’s winning JINGO number. The prize is an all-expenses
trip to South America.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Why can’t the idiot in Circulation who
dreamed up this imbecile contest in the first place —</p>
<p><strong>miss henderson</strong>: Because you’re the Editor-in-Chief.
Your integrity is unquestioned. LOIS I have a question.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Hi, Lois. Morning, Jimmy, you’ve got mustard
on your lapel. Excuse me, Mr. White, I don’t mean to interrupt but —</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Please, Kent, not now. I’m trying to put out
a newspaper here.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: It’ll never replace the printing press,
boss.</p>
<p><strong>miss henderson</strong>: What’s the number, Mr. White?</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: 53.</p>
<p><strong>miss henderson</strong>: 53!</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Okay? Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>miss henderson</strong>: You’ve got to pick three more
numbers.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Mr. White, please, I promised those people
I’d get back to them by this morning. What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Look, I don’t know, Kent. . . CLARK
Personally, I think it could be a terrific story!</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: What terrific story?</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Kent’s been invited to his high-school class
reunion.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Whoopee.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: It’s practically an American ritual,
Mr. White! Isn’t that so, Jimmy?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I wouldn’t know Mr. Kent. Most of the people
I went to high school with are still in high school.</p>
<p><strong>miss henderson</strong>: Could we have the next number
already?</p>
<p><strong>miss henderson</strong>: 33!</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Anyway, the reunion’s just the hook for the
story. What it’s really about is how the typical small town’s changed in
the last fifteen years. how do you like this a title: Can You Go Home
Again ?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Say!</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Take me, for instance. Going back to middle
America after having become a Metropolis sophisticate –</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I’m really excited about this. I even –</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: – I was looking through my closet last and,
sure enough, O found my old high school sweater.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Smallville.</p>
<p><strong>miss henderson</strong>: Mr. White!</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: I’m getting a cramp in my elbow from
this.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Let me do it for you, Mr. White.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: So, Mr. White? Can I go ahead and make my
travel arrangements?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Exactly what I was about to ask about me.</p>
<p><strong>miss henderson</strong>: Do you know what that machine
cost?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Uh. . . sorry –</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: All right, Kent. I just hope you know what
you’re doing. If you really think Smallville is your big chance, go for
it.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: What about me?</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: What about you?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: A story like this cries out for great human
interest pictures. The big dance! The Homecoming Game! Mr. Kent posing
next to his old locker!</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Hey, I’d definitely shoot color on that one,
Jimmy. It’d be a crime to just use black and white.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Okay, Kent, call your people and tell them
the Prodigal Son is coming home. FAVORING CLARK – Happy now, he turns to
leave the office. SHOT LOSES PERRY but we continue to hear his voice,
o.s.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: – but you deserve the vacation, Lois.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Oh. You’re going away.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Yeah, well, some of us get to go to
Smallville. And some of us just have to settle for . . .</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: . . . Bermuda.</p>
<p><strong>miss henderson</strong>: Mr. White, the next number,
please?</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: How’m I supposed to turn this thing?</p>
<p><strong>miss henderson</strong>: By hand. Like the pioneers did.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Couldn’t we just get a computer to do
this?</p>
<p><strong>camera dollies through two glass doors (pov a rolling cart
entering the room).</strong>: WE SEE THE WORDS STENCILED ON THE
DOOR:</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Sonofagun! Look at this here!</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: First paycheck?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: First rip-off, man! Supposed to be 225 bucks a
week! You know what this sucker says?? $143.80! Federal tax! State tax!
Social Security tax!</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: That’s so you’re still getting some money when
you hit 65.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: I ain’t gonna live that long on $143.80! I want
it now, man, while I’m still young and cool.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Actually, it’s probably more like $143.80 and
one-half cent. There’s always fractions over in a big corporation, but
they round it down to the lowest whole number.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: What’m I gonna do with half a cent? Buy me a
thoroughbred cockroach? Everybody loses them fractions?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: They don’t actually lose ’em. You can’t lose
what you never got.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Who gets it, the company?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: No, not really. They can’t be bothered
collecting half a cent from your paycheck anymore than you could.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: So where is all them half-centses?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: They’re just . . . floating around out there.
The computer knows where.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: How many sugars?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: One. And a half.</p>
<p><strong>dissolve to</strong>: :INT. WEBCO COMPUTER ROOM -
TWILIGHT</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Quittin’ time, Gus. Comin’?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Uh . . . no, man. I got some work to finish up
here.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Workin’ overtime? What are you doin’, buddy,
looking for a raise?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Yeah. A raise . .</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: 368zzx4.</p>
<p><strong>hello.</strong>: WEBCO PAYROLL DIVISION. GIVE COMMAND
COORDINATES.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Yeah !</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: But my Uncle Al, on my father’s side, he
won’t eat her stuffing, he says it should be cooked on the outside of
the turkey and she puts the stuffing inside the turkey. So my mother
told my Aunt Ellen . . . Aunt Ellen’s my father’s half-sister, I told
you that, right?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Mmmmm . . .</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: The thing is though, my cousin Arnold, Aunt
Rosey’s Arnold this is, he got mad when Uncle Al insulted his mother’s
stuffing, so now the problem is –</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Wow, what a beautiful sunrise!</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: At one o’clock in the morning?</p>
<p><strong>state policeman</strong>: It’s your choice. Turn back or pull
over to the side of the road till it’s over.</p>
<p><strong>bus driver</strong>: How long’ll that take?</p>
<p><strong>state policeman</strong>: You never know with forest fires.
And this one is spreading like . . . . . . wildfire. We got 10,000 acres
of timber going up like matchsticks and a south wind.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: What’s the south wind got to do with it?</p>
<p><strong>state policeman</strong>: Iroquois Trail Power Plant is just
eight miles south of the fire.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: The nuclear power station?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: How did it start?</p>
<p><strong>state policeman</strong>: Nine times out of ten it’s some
careless camper.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Are there campers trapped in there?</p>
<p><strong>state policeman</strong>: We’re doing our best to get ’em
out.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Keep talking to that state trooper so he
doesn’t notice where I’m going, okay?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You know what Mr. White said. A photographer
always goes after a story.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Jimmy, it’s dangerous!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Danger? That goes with the territory,
Mr. Kent.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Chief, how can I help?</p>
<p><strong>fire chief</strong>: Get this man a helmet and a — Oh! It’s
you! No helmet!</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: What’s the story?</p>
<p><strong>fire chief</strong>: This is a fierce one, Superman. We’ve
got a hundred and twenty men on the northeast border building
firebreaks. I’ve got volunteers coming in from as far away as Ohio.
They’re doing all they can, but –</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Stand back, guys. Where do you want this
firebreak?</p>
<p><strong>crew leader</strong>: From there to there.</p>
<p><strong>forman</strong>: Chief, this is the North Boundary Crew.
We’ve got a firebreak that should contain it on our end.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: It’s not going to be that easy on the south
side. The winds are blowing fireballs right over the breaks.</p>
<p><strong>plant supervisor</strong>: Man, if that fire gets much
closer, we’re going to have ourselves some big trouble.</p>
<p><strong>security chief</strong>: The nuclear reactor?</p>
<p><strong>plant supervisor</strong>: You figure it out. That – is a
cooling tower, right? The nuclear core inside it is stabilized by the
temperature. If the fire gets here, it’ll stop being a cooling tower,
and turn into a furnace.</p>
<p><strong>security chief</strong>: Oh, my God! You mean a
melt-down!</p>
<p><strong>plant supervisor</strong>: Get the civil defense people on
the phone. We may have to evacuate the whole damn state!</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: What??! How did he get there? Some lunatic is
up in the watch- tower taking pictures.</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: So that tower’s right in the middle of pure
hell right now!</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Easy, Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: It’s my leg.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: It’s a clean break right across the
fibula.</p>
<p><strong>firefighter</strong>: The water supply is practically
gone!</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: We’ve got to get water!</p>
<p><strong>firefighter</strong>: How? Lake Comooga is five miles from
here. We haven’t got a five mile hose.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Where is this lake?</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: That way.</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: It’s not going to work! It’s too hot
now!</p>
<p><strong>scientist</strong>: It’s going right off the end of the
scale, Dr. Harris!</p>
<p><strong>dr. harris</strong>: Start the emergency cooling
procedure.</p>
<p><strong>scientist</strong>: It isn’t helping! We’re about two minutes
from melt-down!</p>
<p><strong>dr. harris</strong>: Superman! Be careful! There’s enough
radiation in that core to light up the whole country for a year!</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Don’t worry. I’ll just stabilize it.</p>
<p><strong>dr. harris</strong>: It isn’t very scientific, gentlemen, but
I tell you that man is a miracle.</p>
<p><strong>minnie bannister</strong>: You really have grown, Clark.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: You’re looking well, Miss Bannister.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: Clark?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: LANA?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Will you excuse me, Miss Bannister? There’s
someone I really have to say hello to.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Lana Lang. How great to see you.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: Clark.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: You look wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: You always did. Can I give you a hand with
that?</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: No, I can mange, This is the first time you’ve
been back since your mom passed away, isn’t it? I can’t believe it.
TRACK WITH THEM.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: No, I can mange, This is the first time you’ve
been back since your mom passed away, isn’t it? I can’t believe it. You
came all the way from Metropolis just for this dinky little reunion?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: You shouldn’t say that, you’re the chairman –
…uh, chairperson…</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: And here I am, just standing here. That’s
terrible. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: You’re welcome…??</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: For reminding me, I mean. Can you follow
me?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I’m trying to.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: I just have to give these to the –</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I heard you and Donald split up.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: Did you eat yet?</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: That’s not right. Yes, you’re right about me
and Donald but – hold it a sec, okay?</p>
<p><strong>first man</strong>: Hey, Kent.</p>
<p><strong>second man</strong>: How ya’ doin’?</p>
<p><strong>first man</strong>: Some guys never change…</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Here I am, honey, and I’m all yours. Remember
when you were Queen of the Prom? All the guys had to wait in line to get
a dance. But now there’s only one name on your dance card, sweet thing,
and it’s –</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Brad Wilson.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Hiya, Kent, long time no see. Not that you
ever could. “See” I mean, Hahaha!</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: I can’t Clark already asked me. Didn’t you? He
used to love this song. Didn’t you? So he just said – “Would you dance
with me?”</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Sure, Lana, I’d love to.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Gorman. Another week, another check.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: You got another one there for me?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: What??</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: I put in a voucher for expenses. Thought it
might have come through.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Oh yeah. Here you go.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: Thanks for helping me out.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Are you kidding? There must be a lot of guys
who’d like to be in my place.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: You’d be surprised how many offers I didn’t
get. Even Brad wouldn’t stick around for this. It really isn’t easy.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: The streamers? They’re no problem, you just
pull on them and –</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: Not the streamers. Everything. Not that I’m
complaining. It’s just that – I don’t know why but I feel like I can
talk to you. CLARK What?</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: I feel like I can talk to you!</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Well, I always wished you would. Back when
you were –</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: Queen of the Prom?</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: And three years after the Royal Wedding, the
King abdicated. Isn’t that terrible?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: It sure is.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: There must be a gallon of potato salad left
over.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: You know what’s the problem?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Too much mayonnaise?</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: Mayonnaise? Donald loved mayonnaise. Why would
you think that was the problem.?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I didn’t –</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: No, the problem is – Why do I stay in
Smallville? Believe me, I’ve asked myself the same question. Do you know
how lucky you are to live in Metropolis? The Big Apricot.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: But Lana, you could –</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: That’s easy to say. But how? And what about
Ricky?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: Ricky. My little boy. At least here we’ve got
a house. and I’ve got a job. Okay, I’m only a secretary, oaky, but it
pays the bills. Except for last winter when the fuel bills kept going up
and up and up. I even had to pawn my diamond ring then.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Gee…</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: Well, we can’t fly up there and get them.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: You…um…you never got married?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Oh…I came close once.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: “Earth Angel, Earth Angel, Please be
mine…</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: That song. I remember one day I came into the
music room and you were fooling around at the piano. And I thought –
what am I going to do with all this potato salad?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: You thought that?</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: I thought “Clark Kent has a really nice
voice.” You didn’t even know I was there.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: You know, years later you can look at someone
and think, well, I guess that’s the one, that’s the one that got
away.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Give it to me again, fella. Just run it by me
one more time.</p>
<p><strong>simpson</strong>: 85,000 dollars.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Missing????</p>
<p><strong>simpson</strong>: Embezzled, Mr. Webster. Stolen from the
firm.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: That’s what I want to know! By whom?
Whom????</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Get a hold of yourself, Vera. Nobody else ever
will.</p>
<p><strong>simpson</strong>: I don’t know who. Whom. I can’t trace it.
In the old days it was simple. We kept books, we had ledgers, we could
see what was going in and what was paid out. If somebody wanted to rob
you, he’d come in with a gun and say ’stick ’em up.” Now they get theses
blasted computers to do their dirty work!</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: My friend, you are yesterday. Whoever pulled
this caper is tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>lorelei</strong>: Ross, honey, it’s time for your
massage…</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Bubba, does this woman have the right to burst
in without knocking…!</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Now, Vera…uh, Simpson, you know my Staff
Dietician?</p>
<p><strong>simpson</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: If you don’t mind, we are trying to hold a
meeting here!</p>
<p><strong>lorelei</strong>: Why don’t you hold your breath, instead?
Maybe you’ll turn blue. On you that’d be an improvement.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Pay attention, people: I am about to take a
human life.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Old pal, would you just step outside for a
sec?</p>
<p><strong>vera lorelei</strong>: Bubba, I will not let Ross, tell her
to stop this woman insult me… picking on me or I’ll…</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Mouths …closed! Ears…open! Now the last thing
any of us wants is for me to be upset. Right? Right! and it upsets me
very much when my favorite sister an my favorite Aerobic Instructor
don’t get along.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: I don’t kiss.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Oh, right. Well then, just shake hands.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: That’s my best gals. Come back in, my boy.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Well, chum? What now? Kiss the 85 thou
goodbye? Pay some thief’s salary while he thinks up new ways to shake
the money tree?</p>
<p><strong>simpson</strong>: He’s bound to slip up sooner or later.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>simpson</strong>: Uh…I don’t know…that’s what they always say
in the movies.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Unless the man’s a complete idiot, he won’t
slip up at all. He’ll just go on quietly taking the bread from our
mouths. unless he’s a total ignoramus, he’ll keep a low profile and
won’t do a thing to call attention to himself. Unless he is an utter
moron…</p>
<p><strong>first boy</strong>: That means we gotta take Ricky.</p>
<p><strong>second boy</strong>: Too bad, you lost the toss.</p>
<p><strong>first boy</strong>: If we gotta have Ricky on our side, then
we get a two strike handicap.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: I just can’t stand this.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Hey, he’ll be all right. Believe me Lana, I
know. I was a late bloomer myself.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: It isn’t only that he’s small for his age. how
would you like to be the only kid in town without a father? Look at him,
he’s stewed to the gills in the middle of the afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: But all he had was chocolate milk.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: I mean him.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Hiya, sweet thing. Little guy’s getting’
hassled, huh? Kent, you still here?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I seem to be.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: All the kid needs is a couple of pointers from
the ol’ champ here. Kent, I bet you didn’t know I won the all-country
bowling trophy two years in a row.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Uh, no, I didn’t know that, Brad.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: A natural athlete can play any sport. Any
sport.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: Oh, no. This’ll only make it worse.</p>
<p><strong>first boy</strong>: See? What’d I tell ya?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Hey, sport, you’re holdin’ it all wrong. Lemme
show you –</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Let ol’ Uncle Brad show you how it’s done.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Say, Brad. I think he’ll be better off doing
it his way.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: For a guy who was lucky to be water-boy on the
high school team, you sure got a big mouth, Kent.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I just think Ricky would rather not get a
bowling lesson in front of the other kids.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: The kid needs a man to show him –</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: The kid will do fine on his own. Give it your
best shot, Ricky!</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Clark Klutz. Same as ever.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: Gezundheit!</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Gus?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Say what?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: The boss wants to see you.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Say who?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Oh my God! The Boss! Ross the Boss! The
Ross!</p>
<p><strong>ross webster</strong>: CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Mr. Gorman?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: No! He died last week. I just look something
like him. People always make this mistake.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Mr. Webster is waiting to see you.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: He alone? Or is there, like uh… men in
uniform…or, uh…plain clothes.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Please go in, Mr. Gorman.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Say, dear, where’s the wash room located? I’d
like to freshen up a bit before…</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Yes sir, I’m sending him in.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Mr. August Gorman?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Please, Mr. Webster, you’re a great
humanitarian. Ain’t you heard what it’s like in them jails? You send an
innocent boy in and he gets thrown in with killers and robbers and
rapers and raper killer and robber rapers and…</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Mr. Gorman, just answer me one question…</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: You’ve been a naughty boy haven’t you? C’mon
now, admit it, you were kinda naughty.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Uh…yeah. I didn’t think of it that way exactly,
but…</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Say, fella, I understand. I can – what do the
kids say these days – “dig where you’re comin’ from.” You want to be
rich, right?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Uh…</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Now me, I was born rich. I’ve never worn the
same pair of socks twice.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Yeah? What do you do with ’em?</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: I believe they’re laundered and sent to some
charitable institution. I don’t know what the heck they do with ’em.
Maybe they use them for dust rags, or pen wipers…</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Or socks.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Yes! That never occurred to me. Her ya go,
buddy, single-malt. Gus, my friend, you’re a genius. Okay, a naughty
genius, but hell, nobody’s perfect.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: ‘Cause I know about getting’ them
half-centses?</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Because computers run the world today, pal.
And the fella who can fool the computers will run the world himself!</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: I’ve been searching for a long time for
somebody who can make these machines do things they’re not supposed to
do. Do you catch my drift, brother?</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: I knew you would. And best of all, you seem to
be able to do it in such a way that the deed goes undetected.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Gus, Webco, the Webster industrial complex, is
a family-owned cartel. A little magnesium here, a little zinc there.
Some railroads here, some farm machinery there. You follow?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: I’m tryin’ to.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Gus, do you know what I want now? I want
coffee!</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Black or regular?</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: I don’t think you understand.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Man, what is this?</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Plants. Plants always make an office
cozier.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Hiya, fella, how’s it goin’? Helluva nice guy,
been with me for years.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Under different company names. I control the
price of coffee beans in Brazil. The price in Venezuela. Java, South
Korea, North Korea, the Aleutian Islands, Guam, Bolivia, and the
Republic of Gabon!</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Decaffeinated too?</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: But y’see, chum, the problem I got is that one
country just won’t play ball with me. You know how that can just bug a
guy, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Which country?</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Columbia.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Columbia.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Columbia’s got two major exports and one of
them’s coffee.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Wipe ’em out?</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Destroy the entire Colombian coffee crop down
to the last bean.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Yo! Over here.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: What’s this I see? Fallen leaves not picked
up? Organic litter?</p>
<p><strong>gardner</strong>: Sorry, sir, I was going to do it late–</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: So, fella? You see the problem?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: But Mr. Webster…you’re doin’ okay with Brazil
and them other places. What’s wrong with just one little old country
doin’ their own thing?</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: A very wise man once said…I think it was
Attila the Hun… “It’s not enough that I succeed. Everyone else must
fail.” And you are going to do it for me.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Me? How?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Hey listen, I didn’t know your mama was comin’
by…</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Sister! I’m his sister!</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Gus, tell me, have you ever heard of
Vulcan?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: That what they call you?</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Vulcan is the weather satellite our government
put up in orbit to monitor the weather.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: But if somebody re-programmed it, it could do
much more.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: It could make weather!</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Storms! Floods!</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Blizzards! Heat waves!</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: How do you do that?</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Like everything else in the 20th century, Gus.
You push buttons.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Smile!</p>
<p><strong>mr. stokis</strong>: I can’t believe it! It’s the first time
I ever won anything!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stokis</strong>: You won my hand, Maury.</p>
<p><strong>mr. stokis</strong>: Yeah, sure, but this is the first time I
ever won anything valuable!</p>
<p><strong>miss henderson</strong>: Let’s get one with the sombreros,
Olsen.</p>
<p><strong>miss henderson</strong>: Mr. White, you be in this shot,
handing them their plane tickets.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Why do I have to do this?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Why do I have to do this?</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: You! You’re lucky I didn’t fire you. I get a
chance at exclusive on-the-spot pictures of the biggest forest fire in
history and what does he come back with??? A broken leg and twelve
melted rolls of film.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: It was hot!</p>
<p><strong>miss henderson</strong>: Smile, Mr. White.</p>
<p><strong>mr. stokis</strong>: South America! I can’t believe my
luck!</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Computers talk to other computers, right?</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Somehow your twisted little mind should be
able to figure out how to tap into the main computer at the Aerospace
Center and reach Vulcan.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Through the telephone line terminal, that ain’t
nothin’.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Oh Bubba, think of the possibilities.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: What she call you?</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Bubba. When she was three years old she
couldn’t pronounce the word ‘brother’ and it came out ‘Bubba.’ It was
the last cute thing she ever did.</p>
<p><strong>lorelei</strong>: Did I hear somebody say “cute thing?”</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: She’s not his mama either.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Gus Gorman, this is my Psychic
Nutritionist.</p>
<p><strong>lorelei</strong>: You’re cute too.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: I’m cool. I ain’t cute. it ain’t cool to be
cute.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: She’s drying her nails.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Always making yourself beautiful for me,
aren’t you? So, Gus, can you make Vulcan do what I want it to? You
didn’t answer me, pal. Did you hear about that prison riot last week? It
seems they were complaining about rats in the cells…</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Yeah, yeah, I can do it.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: First question got to be “Where.”</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Not “What.” Don’t need a genius to figure out
“what.” Need a genius to figure out “where.” He says I’m a genius, your
don – Brother! Bubba! Your Bubba! See, if y’all don’t want them to trace
it back, you got to punch this in from someplace nobody’d ever think
off. Some little rinky- dink operation with a little mickey- mouse
computer. ROSS It’s got to be someplace you can sneak into.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Someplace where nobody knows him so they can’t
connect him with us.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Well, Webco has a hundred and twelve
subsidiaries and every one of them is tied to our central computer
system. How about…hmmmm, someplace small…</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I’ll give your mom a hand.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Oh, I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Welcome to nowhere, U.S.A.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Gee, I haven’t done this in years.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: Some people don’t think it’s healthy.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Well, it’s true you have to be careful things
don’t spoil, especially with mayonnaise or cream.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: Clark, I think you worry too much about
mayonnaise.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Me??</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: I’m talking about salt. Oh, go ahead, pour it
on, relax. That’s what picnics are for.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Don’t they have picnics in Metropolis,
Mr. Kent?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Well… Not quite like this.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Mom and I do this all the time.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: It’s nice for Ricky.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: And even nicer when there’s a man around,
Which isn’t all that often.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: There’s a lot of choices here.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: No, all the good ones are married. That’s why
Brad thinks he’s God’s gift to women. This woman anyway. He’s single. He
won’t take no for an answer, but he’s the only one who’s asking. And he
knows it.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I meant all the choices here. All this – –
cole slaw, guacamole – This is some picnic!</p>
<p><strong>camera pans away from clark, losing him from the shot, and
moves to lana just as</strong>: RICKY RUNS TO HER. LANA is still beaming
from CLARK’S praise, as:</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Hey mom, how about me?</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: Peanut butter and jelly.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: No, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: No, I mean Ricky. He’s not interested in any
of this stuff.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Well, this pate is rather…unusual.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: Pate? What pate? I didn’t make any – Oh, no,
Clark. That’s Buster’s dog food.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: Gee, I haven’t laughed like that since – since
– I really can’t remember when.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Me neither…</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: So…how much longer do you think you’ll be in
Smallville –</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: You know, I was just thinking, Lana – –
someone like you could do do really well in Metropolis –</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: I suppose I’ve got to face it – I’m not going
to find what I want in Smallville anymore, but –</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: I can never get a way from it.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Old ties are hard to cut.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: No. I mean, yes they are, but I was talking
about that. Wheat King. Bet your bottom dollar that’s a Wheat King
thresher.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: That’s the biggest change in Smallville, you
know. They’ve taken over this town. Everybody who isn’t actually working
for Wheat King – like I do – is out there – on a Wheat King thresher. Do
you think I could do it? Do you?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Ride a thresher? Well, I don’t know. Girls
are trying just about everything now but –</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: No, what you said before, Could I make it in
Metropolis? I’ve dreamed about it, sure, but I never really thought
about it. What would I do when I got there?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Call me.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: Oh, I wouldn’t want to – I mean, I’d want to,
but I wouldn’t want to…be a nuisance to you.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Hey, you could never be a nuisance.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: Clark, may I tell you something? My oil pan is
leaking.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: See?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Hey, Buster! Darn it… come back, willya?</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: The dog’s always doing that. And the car’s
always doing that.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Can I help?</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: No thanks. With all the trouble this thing
gives me, I started studying up on auto repair.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Think I’ll see if I can help Ricky.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Superman???</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: That’s what they call me.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: Ricky? Where…what…</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: I’d wash that out with some iodine… Okay,
Mercurochrome.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: Thank …you.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Anytime.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: Oh. I’m Lana Lang. This is Ricky.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: We’ve already met.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: And this is… …Clark. My friend is around here
somewhere, I’ll just look for…</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: I’m sorry, I’m in a real hurry. See you
around, pal.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: We were flying!! Mom! In the sky!</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: What were you doing anyway?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: I was looking for… Buster! Buster!</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I found him!</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Mr. Kent! Superman was here!</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: What!</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: He really was!</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: Well, aren’t you excited?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Lana, I’m from Metropolis. I see Superman
every day.</p>
<p><strong>“wheat king farm machinery</strong>: A WEBCO COMPANY.”</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Yeah? What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Buddy, are we in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: First the supplier couldn’t find the invoice.
Then the order came up short. Then I missed the four o’clock plane from
Cleveland and had to rent a car, and then I got a darn flat tire on the
highway! Can you beat it? Boy, your boss must’ve been furious when I
didn’t show up by the end of the day today, huh?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: What are you talkin’ about?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Good lord, fella! I’m talking about your
boss.</p>

our behinds to the wall! this is Special Order! He said he had to have
it before… Omigod!! What’s tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Tuesday.</p>

office tonight before all those big shots come here tomorrow for the
meeting!!</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Get all what set up?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: S’not bad, s’very good, but… y’know what’s
wrong with this… Singapore…thing?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Sling. Singapore Sling. What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Not enough vodka in it.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: There’s no vodka in it.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Aha! What’d I tell ya!</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: What? What did you tell me?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Put vodka in it.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: S’better. Taste it.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Got vodka in it now. Gotta give it a new name.
Hey, listen, you thought it up, we’ll name it after you. What’s your
name?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Brad.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Brad is not a good name for a cocktail.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Hey! Y’know what they used to call me in high
school?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Brad?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: No, no, on the football field. They called me…
…The Smallville Flash.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Hey, man, that’s a great name for a

<p><strong>gus</strong>: Here’s to the Smallville Flash!</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Man, you don’t never pass out, do ya?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Nope. Never.</p>

country of Colombia this afternoon, threatening to destroy this nation’s
entire coffee crop for the next five years. The loss of the major export
would devastate that already strife- torn region’s economy. Meanwhile,
the tornado continues to pound with devastating force. Gale force winds
up to an incredible 200 mph lash the countryside, while 12 inches of
rainfall heave already been recorded in just one day.</p>
<p><strong>t.v. news commentator</strong>: Flood warnings have given way
to evacuation proceedings in the entire southern part of the country. A
spokesman for the Department of Meteorology at Cal Tech here said this
was, and I quote, “the most awesome display of natural forces unleashed
since Noah’s Ark.” He added that the storm’s pattern seems to defy all
known laws of weather systems to…</p>
<p><strong>lorelei</strong>: Ooooooh, I’ll get you for that, you big
silly!</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Bubba, do you realize what we’re onto?</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Do I? Every time a drunk tries to sober up,
he’ll be drinking Webster coffee!</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Why stop at coffee! A cup of coffee gets the
world off to work in the morning, but what keeps the world working?</p>
<p><strong>lorelei</strong>: Diet soda?</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Energy! And when they say “Energy” what do
they mean? Nuclear? too dangerous. Solar?? Too underdeveloped.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: You mean…you mean…Vera! Vera! The magnitude of
this!!!</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Today coffee—-</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: TOMORROW THE OIL!</p>
<p><strong>lorelei</strong>: Oil?</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: We already have Webster Petroleum pumping 12
billion barrels a year.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Small potatoes.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: We already have a super-tanker.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Chicken feed. If Gus Gorman can push the right
buttons —</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: I could have it all! Holy cats! All the oil!
All the tankers! All the pumps! The gosh-darn world will be out to
lunch! No heat, no gas–sis, this is some nifty idea!</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Hey, boss.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Just the man I wanted to see!</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Turn on the T.V.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: I did. isn’t it neat-o?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Uh…what channel were you watching?</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: What are you talking about, fella?</p>
<p><strong>t.v. news commentator</strong>: …and in an all-out effort,
Superman has been simply awesome. Awesome in his power. Awesome in his
strength. Awesome in his ability to single-handedly reverse this wave of
terror and save little Colombia from the brink of destruction. One man –
a super man, to be sure – is taking on the very force of Nature’s fury
and, at this point, he seems to be winning!</p>
<p><strong>(first images of superman at work appear on t.v. screen, then
go to normal film</strong>: FRAME)</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stokis</strong>: Maury! Forget the pictures!</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: No! No! No!</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: It was perfect! It was the perfect plan! It
was foolproof.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Just a matter of time ‘til they start blamin’
me. that’s always what happens. He slips his feet into the ski boots,
curious to try them. FOLLOW HIM as he starts to walk clumsily up the
slope, trying to master his balance in this odd footwear.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Ain’t my fault, I done what I was supposed to
do. Everybody blames it on me when they start lookin’ to get it off
themselves. Some kid in the classroom blows a spit-ball, who gets sent
to the principle’s office? Gus Gorman.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: He ruined it! That lousy do-gooder, he ruined
it.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Don’t cry, Bubba.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: AIEEEE!</p>
<p><strong>lorelei</strong>: Vera’s practicing her karate.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Nice try, Butch, but it wouldn’t be effective
against Superman. You’ll see! Now that he’s pulled this stunt, he’ll
stick his nose in my oil scheme and ruin that one, too! I’ve got to get
rid of him! I’ve got to!</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: How? Shoot him? You know about him and
bullets. Not to mention knives, tanks, bombs…</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Apartment in the project gets broke in, who
gets hauled into the line-up? Gus Gorman.</p>
<p><strong>lorelei</strong>: Kryptonham!</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lorelei</strong>: Kryptonham… or Kryptonheimer…I forget what
you call it, but it’s the stuff that can kill Superman.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: How would you know?</p>
<p><strong>lorelei</strong>: Hey, I know a lot of things!</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: So I understand from the graffiti I’ve
seen.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Wait a minute! She’s right! Kryptonite. I
remember reading about it in an interview with him. Nuts…</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: I just remembered the rest. There isn’t any
more. The only chunk that ever landed on Earth disappeared a couple of
years ago. It was in this story in the Daily Planet.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Where did it come from?</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: The planet Superman came from. Krypton.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: It ain’t. It’s nowhere. It blew up. That’s how
come they shipped the dude to Earth when he was a baby. well. I know
some stuff too, y’all.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Wait a second. Astronomers know where the
planet used to be, right? And you know what happens when a planet
explodes? Debris. Pieces floating in space.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: So all we’ve got to do is pick up the garbage.
We just have to find our where in Heaven Krypton used to be. Then good
old Gus here contacts the Vulcan satellite–</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Just hold on a minute. I have been doin’ some
thinkin’</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: God, that’s what I keep you for.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: That’s what I been thinkin’ about. How you been
keepin’ me. I ain’t getting’ nothing outta this gig.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Gus, if there’s anything I hate, it’s
greed.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Greed! Let me tell you something—</p>
<p><strong>plutonium . . . 15.08%</strong>: TANTALUM . . . 18.0 % XENON
. . . 27.71% PROMETHIUM . . 24.02%</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Uh-huh! Uh-huh!</p>
<p><strong>dialum . . . 10.62%</strong>: MERCURY . . . 4.08%</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: He ain’t gonna smoke this stuff, so what the
hell…</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: The Boss says he wants this to go.</p>
<p><strong>mr. stokis</strong>: Where is he? He’ll pay for this! Get
your wallet out, Mr. Editor!</p>
<p><strong>miss henderson</strong>: Please, Mr. Stokis, it isn’t
Mr. White’s fault if —</p>
<p><strong>mr. stokis</strong>: Don’t touch me!</p>
<p><strong>as they continue out of frame toward perry white’s office in
b.g. hold on clark</strong>: – who looks up momentarily from his
typewriter then goes back to work intently on his reunion story.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: “Old relationships suddenly seem the same as
ever.” “The prettiest girl in the school is still the prettiest
girl…”</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Hello? Lana! Hey, I was just thinking about–
What’s wrong? …what about Ricky?</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: Well, that autograph you got him from Superman
– he got really carried away after that and told the other kids that
Superman’s his pal. And he said Superman’s even coming to visit him for
his birthday next Wednesday. Okay, it was wrong. But when Wednesday
comes…and Superman doesn’t…</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: No, well in this case I think I can speak for
him. I mean, I’m pretty close to him, you know. Superman will be there
on Wednesday.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: Well, he’s going to get the best home-cooked
meal he’s had in… in a long time. You tell Superman we think he’s
wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: But Clark…you’re the best. INT. DAILY PLANET,
CLARK KENT’S DESK - DAY</p>
<p><strong>mr. stokis</strong>: Bad luck??!! I’ll give you bad luck!!!
I’m suing you! I’m suing your paper! I’m suing her— And I’ll take it to
the Supreme Court if I have to!!</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: It wasn’t our fault. It was an act of
God!</p>
<p><strong>mr. stokis</strong>: In a church????!!</p>
<p><strong>scientist</strong>: Here you are. I can’t imagine what you
want with it, but you’ve got it.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Hey, what’m I scared of? I’m an Earthling.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: You know, I really wasn’t expecting all
this.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: Well…I guess they did get a little carried
away.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Superman, we all know you’re not looking for
honors and awards. But when we heard that you were coming to see your
pal Ricky…</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: …we realized this was our chance to say thank
you. First, for putting out a forest fire that could have ruined miles
of timberland. Second, for averting a terrible tragedy at the Iroquois
Trail Nuclear power Plant. And not least, for saving little Ricky. So,
since you already have won the key to our hearts, Superman, may I
present you with… …the key to the city.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Not to be outdone by the office of the Mayor,
the Ladies’ Auxiliary would like you to have… …The Smallville
Cookbook.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Thank you, ladies. I’m sure this will come
in handy.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Ten-hut!</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Listen up! I’ve come here direct from the
Pentagon so you better believe there’s a damn good reason! I’m here to
tell you that God has given us the greatest goddamn gift in the world:
nuclear power! But if we don’t protect it, it’s our ass! And democracy’s
ass! And the free world’s ass!</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: You people want to be able to go to church on
Sunday and sit in the Super Bowl, don’t you? But what about the
peacetime uses of nuclear power? You all want some Ay-rabs in white
robes tellin’ you you got to pay through the nose for their Cadillac
limousines so you can get enough juice to light up your Christmas
tree??! Not to mention the nice clean air so the great American bald
eagle can fly without coughin’ himself to death!</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Now last week half this great nation almost bit
the bullet, nuclear- power-wise. Wasn’t anything the military could do
about it – we were busy protecting our borders at the time it happened.
So I say, thank the good lord above for Superman!</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Just when it looked like curtains– and I don’t
mean just the Iron Curtain, I mean all the curtains! – Along came this
great American! Superman, you saved our bacon. We want to show our
gratitude. GUS snaps his fingers imperiously at VERA, who stands below
the platform.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: I want to present you with this token of
appreciation for what did to stop the disaster at Iroquois Trail. It’s
your government’s way of saying, “Hey buddy, you done real good.”</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Thanks. General. It’s…swell.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Well…uh…I ain’t got no time to stick around for
the corn-on- the-cob and square dancing or whatever it is you people do.
We got to get back to the base for… uh…well, I can’t tell you what for,
it’s top secret.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: At ease! Siddown!</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: “Unknown,” how was I supposed to know what
‘unknown’ is…</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Hello, Boss? …You know how people’s always
tryin’ to copy that secret recipe for that fried chicken they sell in
them buckets, but nobody can figure out the secret ingredient?</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: He didn’t die???? I ask you to kill Superman
and you’re telling me you couldn’t even do that one simple
thing??!!!</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: He was asleep before his head hit the pillow.
Well, this was only the biggest day of his life. I really don’t know how
to thank you.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: You just did, with that great dinner.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: Oh well, I do like to cook. You’ll take some
coffee, won’t you? Decaffeinated, of course.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: Superman, I’m sorry. I really hate to cut this
evening short, but… my friend Betty just called! There’s been an
accident on the old River Bridge. A tank truck filled with acid turned
over! It’s leaking acid and they’re afraid the bridge is collapsing! I
am sorry. I hate to make you rush off!</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: There’s no rush.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: But the bridge…</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Hey, Don’t I always get there in time?
Come on, relax.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: It’s hard to believe… a great looking girl
like you all alone like this. As she glances up at him, she is first
flustered, then flattered, then…finally…just realistic:</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: Listen, are you sure you shouldn’t do
something about the bridge?</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: The bridge…? I’d better get going!</p>
<p><strong>first guy</strong>: It won’t hold! It’s going!</p>
<p><strong>a sheriff</strong>: Clear the area! Clear the area!</p>
<p><strong>emergency crew chief</strong>: Get down!</p>
<p><strong>superman.</strong>: NEW ANGLE – he lands on the river bank.
although we can’t as yet quite be certain, especially in this
half-light, it seems that the colors of his costume have darkened almost
imperceptibly, the blue just a shade deeper, the red a bit darker, His
hair seems a little out of place, but then, that might be from the
wind…</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: What… What can I do to help?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Not much of anything now.</p>
<p><strong>emergency crew chief</strong>: If only you’d got here a few
minutes ago.</p>
<p><strong>souvenir seller</strong>: Mamma Mia!</p>
<p><strong>souvenir seller</strong>: Super-Cretino! Stronzo!… MONTAGE:
NEWSPAPERS</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: “At a special session of the General Assembly,
178 countries voted to censure Superman. With only Columbia abstaining.”
ROSS That fella’s becoming a public menace.</p>
<p><strong>lorelei</strong>: And he use to be such a sweetie pie! What’s
wrong with him the last two weeks?</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Time for you push-ups. 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and
1 and 2 and …</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: That’s what I like to see. My two best gals
pulling together.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: He sure wasn’t actin’ bad and nasty that day in
Smallville. Man, he was so full of niceness I was startin’ to feel funny
about layin’ that chunk of…</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: KRYPTONITE!</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Don’t you see? Okay, so you didn’t kill him.
Nobody’s perfect. But that stuff we ran up in the lab wasn’t a complete
failure after all. Right after Gus gave it to him, Superman started to
turn into a selfish, ornery, malicious, conniving…</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: A normal person.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: And now that Superman’s out of the Nice Guy
business…</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: We can get to work on that oil!</p>
<p><strong>lorelei</strong>: How can he say that pure categories have no
objective meaning in transcendental logic? What about synthetic
unity?</p>
<p><strong>lorelei</strong>: Hi, honey, am I in your way?</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: No, stick around, you might learn
something.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Every oil tanker and super- tanker and
super-duper-tanker in the ocean is controlled. totally, by computers.
Computers to tell them where to go, how much oil to take on, where to
deliver it.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: They ain’t got captains?</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Yes, but they don’t really need them. it’s
just a throw- back to some sentimental sea- faring baloney.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: You will command the tankers to sail toward a
50-mile area in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: And do what?</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: And do nothing. Just sit there.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Then how’s all the people gonna get their
oil?</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: You catch on fast, old buddy. Tell him about
the pumps. I know how you love the part about the pumps.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Every pump in America is run…</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: I know, by computers.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Will you stop interrupting ?! You will command
the pumps to stop pumping.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: And then shut down the pipe lines.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Pumps stop pumping oil. Pipe lines stop pipin’
oil. Tankers stop deliverin’ oil. Man, this is high stakes.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Thanks, kiddo. now, listen, this part’s
important. I want you to program one special command into all these
systems. Tell them these orders are irreversible, so it’ll be impossible
for anybody to switch them back. Can you do that, pal?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Lookit, you’re getting’ what you want all the
time. it ain’t right that I don’t get somethin’! I never get
somethin’!</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: I knew it, I knew it, go be nice to people and
they think they can ask for the moon!</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: The moon! Listen, man, when I was a little
bitty kid all my friends got them electric trains for Christmas. My mama
didn’t have barely enough to pay the electric bill, let alone buy me no
train set.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: This sounds like it’s going to be sad. I’m
leaving.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Now…when do I get a taste?</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: I should think a taste of freedom is enough,
don’t you? Or would you prefer jail?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Don’t lay that jail number on me no more. You
need me out here doin’ stuff for you more’n sitten’ in no jail doin’
nothin’ for nobody. ‘Sides, I be known’ some heavy stuff about you now.
You don’t want em spillin’ the coffee beans.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Is this blackmail?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Don’t be getting’ racist with me, man.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Is this whitemail?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Fair’s fair.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: A waste-basket? GUS Those are plans.
Blueprints.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: A computer.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: We’ve already got some.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Not like this one you ain’t. Nobody in the
world got one like this ’cause it don’t exist yet. We got to build
it.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: You designed it?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: I invented it, man. In my head. It’s a stone
killer-diller get-down get-it-on and twice-on-Sunday super mutha
computer.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: What will it do?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Everything.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: What will it get me?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Anything.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Tell me more…</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: That’s it! The last tanker! They’re all mine
now! All…</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Not quite. What is that in the lower right
hand corner?</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: It’s a tanker! And it’s going the wrong
way!</p>
<p><strong>first mate</strong>: There it is again, Sir. “Proceed
immediately to latitude 241, longitude 73. There await further
orders.”</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: That’s the middle of the Atlantic Ocean!
And I am not taking my ship out there to just sit, no matter what no
damn machine says. We’re supposed to go to Metropolis and we’re going to
Metropolis!</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Miss? Miss, can you hear me? Don’t jump!
Don’t despair! You have everything to live for. I know, I’ve seen
you.</p>
<p><strong>lorelei</strong>: I thought you’d never get here.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Hey, don’t expect me to save you. Because
I don’t do that anymore.</p>
<p><strong>lorelei</strong>: Don’t worry. I’m long past saving.</p>
<p><strong>lorelei</strong>: Well, don’t let me keep you from
anything.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: I’m in no rush. So what do you have in
mind?</p>
<p><strong>lorelei</strong>: Lots of things…</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>lorelei</strong>: I’ll do more than tell you. I’ll show you,
back at my place. If you’ll just do me one little favor first.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Okay, what is it? You want a ride?</p>
<p><strong>lorelei</strong>: Never. I get air-sick. You wouldn’t like
that.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: No, I don’t think I would. So… then what
can I do for you?</p>
<p><strong>lorelei</strong>: It isn’t much, really, you see, there’s
this little boat. Well, not so little, really. And it’s not going where
it’s supposed to go and…</p>
<p><strong>lorelei</strong>: How about a little apres-ski?</p>
<p><strong>state dept. man</strong>: The choppy seas may be a blessing,
they ought to contain the oil spill for at least two weeks before it
reaches the Nantucket current.</p>
<p><strong>a reporter</strong>: Then what?</p>
<p><strong>state dept. man</strong>: After that, it’s just a question of
which part of the East Coast gets the brunt of the spill.</p>
<p><strong>second reporter</strong>: How big is it now?</p>
<p><strong>state dept. man</strong>: Almost a mile long.</p>
<p><strong>driver behind</strong>: Get to the back like everybody
else!</p>
<p><strong>driver behind</strong>: You sonofa—</p>
<p><strong>station wagon driver’s wife</strong>: Charley! Charley!</p>
<p><strong>station wagon driver’s wife</strong>: Help! Somebody help! My
husband… he got beaten up! Call the police. Please, call an ambulance!
Do something!</p>
<p><strong>first waitress</strong>: Here, Jack. Go with her, okay? Take
a look at him. Somebody’s behind this. You can’t tell me there’s no oil.
You can’t tell me somebody isn’t getting rich off this. There’s always
getting rich…and it’s always the little guy who suffers.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Cheer up, Gus, I have good news. Your computer
is being built as we speak.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Yeah? How’s it look?</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: It looks wonderful. it is wonderful, let’s
face it.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: I told you it wasn’t no jive.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Gus, it seems we are talking state-of-the-art
technology here. We are talking unlimited power. We are talking
“get-down hot-cha daddy-o” whatever you called it.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Stone mutha.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Exactly. Stoned mother.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: But a machine this powerful is going to make
powerful enemies. People who will want to destroy it.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Ain’t nobody gonna mess with my machine!
I’ll…I’ll… what will I do? I’ll build in a counter-punch! Anything
attacks it gets counter- attacked! And wiped out!</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Can you do that?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Yeah, sure. Ain’t nobody gonna stomp my
electric train…</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Remember, Gus. A machine doesn’t want anything
except to keep on being a machine. You’ve got to make sure it can figure
out how to beat any opponent.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Man, all it got to do is find their weak spot.
You bet on the machine in any fight you name, you gonna win your
bet.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: No, I cannot go out with you tonight…No, I’m
busy tomorrow night too.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Doing what?</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: I’ll think of something. Look, I’ve got to go.
Ricky needs me. The first part of the problem is okay, honey, but here I
think–</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: – you’ve got the wrong number. No, not you. I
wish you’d get the wrong number. Brad, please stop calling me. I’ve told
you– –four times forty and then divide five. Give it another.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: I’m getting a little tired of trying, Lana.
Why don’t you wise up? Now that Cluck Kent’s flown the coop, you’d
better start appreciating ole faithful Brad. What else’ve you got in
Smallville?</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: What else have I got in Smallville?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Mom? I think I’ve got the answer…</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: So do I. Smallville Airport? What flights do
you have to Metropolis tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: I can’t get though, lady. Something’s going
on here.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: I wanna see what’s happening.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: It’s a disgrace, that’s what it is.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I’ll tell you one thing, boy, nobody’ll ever
trust that creep again. He’s washed up.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Superman!</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Superman, it’s me, Ricky! Ricky from
Smallville!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Be careful, kid!</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Superman, tell them you won’t hurt
anybody!</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: Ricky, he’s changed.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: No! Maybe…maybe he’s just sick! Sometimes
when I’m sick I get real cranky and mean, Mom, you even told me
that.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Superman, please get better!</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: He’s not listening to you, Ricky.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Yes he is! He can hear me! He’s got
Super-Hearing.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: You can hear me, can’t you, Superman? I know
you’re going to be all right! You’re just in a slump! You’ll be great
again. You can do it, Superman!</p>
<p><strong>ricky’s voice</strong>: You’re just in a slump! You’ll be
great again. Great again! Please get better! Please get better!
Superman! Get better!</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Give up. Give in.</p>
<p><strong>(evil) superman</strong>: Like hell I will.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Try me!</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Man, I never did like you. You always got
on my nerves.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Come to think of it, you always got under my
skin.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Man, you’re finished!</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Come on out and fight like a man!</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Give up! Give up! Give up!</p>
<p><strong>seaman</strong>: My God! Look!</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Captain, I’d like to apologize for what I
did before. I… I really wasn’t myself.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: That’s all right, lad. All’s well that ends
well, as they say.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Here you go, little fella.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: C’mon, you take the head start.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: See you around the sky, pal. Keep ’em
flying.</p>
<p><strong>voice of ross</strong>: Miss Lorelei Ambrosia isn’t at home
right now. If you’d care to leave a message, don’t wait for the beep.
Why not deliver it to her in person?</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Here is where you can find her, as well as the
rest of us.</p>
<p><strong>lorelei</strong>: This is fun!</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Fun? The fun’s just starting, hon. Wait till
Superman finds us, then you’ll see fun.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: You want to mess with Superman?</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Can’t wait, pal, can’t wait.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Let’s go. I want to be ready for him when he
falls into our trap. I don’t see why you can’t balloon down like the
rest of us.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Uh-huh. No way, man. Not me. I just don’t
believe a man can fly.</p>
<p><strong>lorelei</strong>: I can’t see anything.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Turn on the light.</p>
<p><strong>lorelei</strong>: Where’s the light switch?</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Where do you usually find a light switch?</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: I told you, didn’t I? The Ultimate Computer!
It does everything any computer can do and a thousand things that none
of them do!</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Come on, let’s give it a dry run.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Wait for Gus to get here, sis.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Who needs Gus?</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: He’s the only one who can operate this –</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Like fish he is. I know enough about computers
to put a PHD to shame. Come now, brother dear, you didn’t think I was
going to let that little man run the show, did you? Gus Gorman telling
us what to do – I’d sooner kiss a pig!</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Come on, will you? We’ve got to get ready
before he gets here.</p>
<p><strong>lorelei</strong>: Gus?</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Superman. The boy you left behind.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Honestly, you’d think these workmen would
learn to tidy up when they finish.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Bubba, engage those levers on your right to
activate the Alpha Circuits and lock the modular grid.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: You! Activate circuits 29 through W7 and start
Full Power Coordinates on Exterior Defensive Systems:</p>
<p><strong>lorelei</strong>: In other words, push this red button.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: He’s here!</p>
<p><strong>lorelei</strong>: Oh, Superman!</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Cut the mush, Lorelei. He’s after our
skin!</p>
<p><strong>lorelei</strong>: He can have mine. Anytime.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: C’mon, sis, let the games begin!</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: All right, Bubba, enjoy yourself.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: The rockets’ red glare, the bombs burstin’ in
air – what in hell is goin’ on?</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: A hit! Got him! This will give him something
to think about!</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Awright. I got me my electric train, mama. I
finally got – Hey, what y’all doin’ up there?!</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Join the party, genius! Come on up!</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: All right, Webster. Pack it in.</p>
<p><strong>lorelei</strong>: Hi, honey.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: I don’t know you, lady.</p>
<p><strong>lorelei</strong>: But the other night…</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: That wasn’t me. That guy’s gone. And
you’re next Webster.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Don’t you threaten my Bubba!</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Welcome to the wonderful world of computers,
Superman.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Well, Superman? How do you like
Supermachine?</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Typical of your kind, Webster. Instead of
using it to help others, all the four of you want is to help
yourselves.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Four of us? What’s he mean four of us? Hey,
man!</p>
<p><strong>lorelei</strong>: That’s only his last name. He likes to be
called Super-man.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Hey, I ain’t with them!</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: You could’ve fooled me, mister.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: He’s coming! He’s going to hurt me!</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Don’t bet on it!</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: No! You’ll kill him! That’s Kryptonite!</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Yes! This time we got it right!</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: It’s your genius, pal! You built a machine
that can find anybody’s weak spot, just like you said.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Congratulations, chum! you’re going to go down
in history as the man who killed Superman!</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: No! Give me that! Give it to me!</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Give it to me—-</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Nooooooo!</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Thanks for –</p>
<p><strong>lorelei</strong>: Make it stop!</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: I can’t! It’s out of control!</p>
<p><strong>lorelei</strong>: But how? Where’s it getting the power from
???!</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: It’s feeding itself. It wants to live.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: All right, nurse, we’re going into the brain
now. Be ready with every–</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Oh, God—</p>
<p><strong>lorelei</strong>: No! Don’t leave us alone in here! Superman
–</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: I don’t know about you, girly, but I’m getting
out of here!</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Sis! No, it’s Bubba–</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Mommy! Mommy!</p>
<p><strong>dr. harris</strong>: What the hell is causing it?!</p>
<p><strong>scientist</strong>: Search me. All I know is it looks like a
complete electronic grid-lock. And if it gets to us–</p>
<p><strong>dr. harris</strong>: Which one is the panic button?</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Help me…help me….</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: You’re Hungry for energy? Taste this.</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: Regular or premium?</p>
<p><strong>man in car</strong>: What the hell, she hasn’t had a drink in
so long, let’s give her a tankful of the good stuff.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: How you doing down there?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Don’t make me talk, please. I got enough
problems just hangin’ on.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Hey, you’re perfectly safe.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: I ain’t about to argue with you. What’s gonna
happen to them three? Ross the boss and those ladies?</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: That’s up to the judge, Gus. It’s not your
problem anymore.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Watch out for them air pockets!</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: No, we’re just going down.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: We gonna crash?</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: I never crash, Gus. That’d be
embarrassing.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: We back in Metropolis?</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: No…I just have a little stop to make.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Whatcha wanna stop here for? Not that I ain’t
glad to be on the ground, y’understand.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Just a second.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Can you guys spare this one?</p>
<p><strong>a miner</strong>: …Sure, Superman. It is Superman, isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Hey, man, who’dya think it was, your mama?</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Too showy.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Thanks. Let’s go</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: I was afraid you’d say that. Hey, is there a
bus station around here?</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Suit yourself, Gus. Say, does your boss
use a computer in this operation?</p>
<p><strong>first miner</strong>: Yeah, a small one. Why?</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: You tell him he can do a lot worse than
giving Gus Gorman here a job. Tell him I guarantee it.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Take it easy, man.</p>
<p><strong>first miner</strong>: You flew with him?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: So, You fellas ain’t never seen the super dude
before, huh? Him and me, we go way back. I mean way back. We generally
help each other out, y’see, like just yesterday was in this cave,
see…</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Hi. I reserved a table for two.</p>
<p><strong>maitre d’</strong>: I’m sorry, but we won’t be able to seat
you.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: I know I’m a little early but –</p>
<p><strong>maitre d’</strong>: We won’t be able to seat you later
either. Gentlemen are required to wear jacket and tie.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Oh. I’d better try to catch her before she
leaves.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: Clark! What a nice surprise! Come on in.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Hi. Mister Kent. Guess who Mom’s having
dinner with tonight? Superman!</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Actually, that’s why I stopped by. He’s realy
sorry, he wanted to make it, but then he…ran into a problem.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: I guess he misses a lot of dinners.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: But if you wouldn’t mind settling for me
–</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: Anyday…</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: He asked me to give you something. You know,
he and I, we talk all the time. And when he heard about you having to
pawn your diamond ring, he thought that was terrible. So when he found
this sort of, um, lying around – well, he thought you might like to have
it.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: I…I…</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Wait till you see her. Hair like a sunset,
eyes like stars, and built like a –</p>
<p><strong>guy with eyepatch</strong>: A chick like that, what’s she
want with you?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: She’s my girl. I came all the way from
Smallville just to bring her back. She’s crazy about me – she just don’t
know it yet.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Wow, a ring form Superman! Lemme see,
Mom!</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Here, I’ll get those.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: I really don’t know what to say. Thank you. I
mean, thank him–</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Wha—-you sonofa—-</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: Brad!</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: whoops—-</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Take it easy now, c’mon, be reasonable.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Kent, I hate you. I always hated you. And you
know why, Kent? Because you’re nice. Nice guys finish—-</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: No wonder they sent it back.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Lois, I’ve got to hand it to you. You’re
amazing. Who else could manage to turn a three-week tropical vacation
into a front page story that’s going to blow the lid off government
corruption in the Caribbean?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: I just knew I was onto something when that
taxi driver kidnapped me.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: You’re the best, Lois.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: I’d better be. Suddenly I’ve got competition
to keep up with. Your high school reunion article. I though it was
terrific. And fascinating. Especially about the girl back home. I’ll
tell you what, Clark, I’ll take you to lunch and you can tell me all
about it.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Gee, I’m sorry, Lois. But I’ve already got a
lunch date. With Mr. White’s new secretary.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Oh?</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: Hi. Clark.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Lois, met Lana Lang. Smallville’s latest gift
to Metropolis.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Oh??</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: Glad to meet you, Miss Lane. I like your
writing a lot.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Thanks. I like your sparkler a lot.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: Me too. I couldn’t believe it when Clark gave
it to me.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Clark gave you – ???</p>
<p><strong>miss henderson</strong>: Mr. White, look what I’ve got for
you.</p>
<p><strong>miss henderson</strong>: It’s modern. It’s up-to-date. It’s
state-of-the art. People, I am in love with this machine. Go ahead,
Mr. White.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Where’s the handle?</p>
<p><strong>miss henderson</strong>: There is no handle! You just push a
button.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: What’s that terrible smell?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Uh…excuse me, folks…</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Kent!</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I’m sorry, Mr. White, but I’ve got an errand
to run.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Gosh, what an awful thing to have
done.</p>
<p><strong>shopkeeper</strong>: Cretino! Stronzo!</p>
