<p><strong>ext. jewelry exchange - day</strong>: The armored truck pulls
up. An ARMORED TRUCK GUARD emerges from the back with a satchel and
heads inside.</p>
<p><strong>int. jewelry exchange - lobby - continuous action</strong>: A
large foyer. Security station and elevators. PARTY SOUNDS can be heard
from a second floor balcony. DOUGLAS is the security guard manning the
station. Seeing the Armored car Guard entering, he picks up the phone
and dials. Beat. Into phone –</p>
<p><strong>douglas</strong>: Last delivery’s finally here.</p>
<p><strong>armored truck guard</strong>: Party?</p>
<p><strong>douglas</strong>: Introducing a new line of jewelry.</p>
<p><strong>armored truck guard</strong>: Wife wants me to buy her a ruby
ring. Told her to spend a little time with the family jewels first.</p>
<p><strong>armored truck guard</strong>: Keep it real.</p>
<p><strong>int. elevator - continuous action</strong>: We see the
security guard with the satchel use a key-card to gain elevator access
to the lower floors. As the elevator doors slide closed…</p>
<p><strong>int. vault anteroom - moments later</strong>: An exclusive
showroom. Display tables empty. At one end of the room, the elevator. At
the other end, the open door to a walk-in vault.</p>
<p><strong>int. vault anteroom - day</strong>: The man in the suit has
finished unloading the cart. He closes the heavy vault door and spins a
large wheel on the door, securing the vault.</p>
<p><strong>int. subway tunnel - day</strong>: Fait and Miles run down
the dark tunnel, staying close to the wall. Miles stumbles. Falls toward
the deadly, high- voltage third rail. Out of nowhere, Fait’s hand grabs
Miles’ jacket. Stops him. Just before he hits. Inches from the rail.
Fait pulls him back up and away from the danger.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Watch yourself.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Keep it tight.</p>
<p><strong>int. jewelry exchange - lobby - day</strong>: Sounds of the
PARTY continue from upstairs. At the security station, the guard,
Douglas, looks up from a magazine and scans the security monitors.</p>
<p><strong>angle - security monitors</strong>: depicting the empty
vault, empty vault anteroom, various empty store areas and the elevator,
in which we see the man in the suit riding up.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: Douglas settles back in with his
magazine.</p>
<p><strong>int. subway tunnel - day</strong>: Fait and Miles reach an
access door tagged with paint. Fait starts to open it. Suddenly, the
tunnel is filled with the ROAR of an APPROACHING TRAIN. Fait and Miles
leap to the wall. Press their backs against it as tightly as they can.
The TRAIN whooms past, inches from their faces. When it’s gone, Miles
sighs with relief. Fait cracks the access door.</p>
<p><strong>int. subway utility tunnels - day</strong>: Fait moves
quickly, Miles following. Fait makes fast lefts and rights, following
more spray paint. They branch off into a small dirt-floored space, deep
in the sub-foundation of a building. Fait stops. Overhead is a flat
ceiling. On the ceiling, his flashlight finds a spray- painted
circle.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Bull’s-eye.</p>
<p><strong>christophe</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: We’re in position.</p>
<p><strong>christophe</strong>: Delivery confirmed. The stones are
there.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Not for long.</p>
<p><strong>click. hiss.</strong>: Su didn’t like what he just heard.
Curses in Chinese. And takes off.</p>
<p><strong>ext. christophe’s apartment building - day</strong>: Perched
on the side of a cliff above the Pacific, next to the park. The top
floor is at street level. Su easily gains access to the roof of the
building. He moves to an exact position just at the ocean-side edge.
It’s an eight-story drop. Su faces in. And then… Hops backward off the
roof. Falling feet-first through the air, Su momentarily grabs onto an
eight-floor balcony rail, slowing his descent, then lets go. Momentarily
grabs a seventh-floor rail and lets go. Grabs a sixth-floor rail. Hangs
on this time. Vaults lightly onto the balcony.</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: Where are the stones?</p>
<p><strong>christophe</strong>: Who the fuck are you?</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: Who’s getting them for you?</p>
<p><strong>christophe</strong>: Fuck off.</p>
<p><strong>christophe</strong>: I’ll tell you.</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>int. sub-foundation - day</strong>: A plasma torch burns
through the metal-reinforced slab overhead. Fait taps Miles, who turns
off the torch. Fait hammers at the last layer. And…</p>
<p><strong>int. vault anteroom - continuous action</strong>: A hole
appears under the private display table, where it can’t be seen by the
room’s security camera.</p>
<p><strong>int. sub-foundation - day</strong>: Fait communicates via a
high-tech, transmitting/receiving earwig.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Daria.</p>
<p><strong>int. jewelry exchange - lobby - day</strong>: Douglas looks
up from his magazine and checks the security monitors again. Everything
a-okay.</p>
<p><strong>angle - front door</strong>: A limo pulls up outside.</p>
<p><strong>ext. jewelry exchange - day</strong>: A uniformed chauffeur
gets out of the limo, moves to the back and opens the door. A very
attractive woman in a short, tight dress emerges.</p>
<p><strong>daria</strong>: I’m here for the reception.</p>
<p><strong>douglas</strong>: Name, please?</p>
<p><strong>daria</strong>: Angie Rawlins.</p>
<p><strong>douglas</strong>: Thank you. You can go on up. Front
elevator, to the mezzanine.</p>
<p><strong>daria</strong>: … I hate these things. Don’t you hate these
things?</p>
<p><strong>douglas</strong>: I’m just here to do my job.</p>
<p><strong>daria</strong>: Then again, you never know who you’re going
to meet…</p>
<p><strong>douglas</strong>: Really, ma’am. I have a job to do.</p>
<p><strong>daria’s pov</strong>: The magazine is Genre. Males for males.
Buff boys. Big pecs, big penises.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: Daria steps back.</p>
<p><strong>daria</strong>: Well, I suppose I should go up and see what
they’re selling.</p>
<p><strong>daria</strong>: Tommy…</p>
<p><strong>daria</strong>: Change of plans. He’s gay.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: No way.</p>
<p><strong>daria</strong>: Yeah way.</p>
<p><strong>int. sub-foundation - day</strong>: Fait and Miles have heard
it, too. Into his mike –</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Tommy. Your turn.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Uh-uh.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: This isn’t a conversation. Do it.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>daria</strong>: Key-card.</p>
<p><strong>daria</strong>: Why don’t you keep my purse? I shouldn’t be
too long.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: … Aloha.</p>
<p>****: The following scene is INTERCUT with Scenes 20 Douglas looks up
from his magazine.</p>
<p><strong>douglas</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I hope you don’t take offense at this… but I
just have such a weakness for a man in uniform.</p>
<p><strong>douglas</strong>: If that’s your thing…</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Uniform’s definitely my thing. I mean, I see
a sailor, I’m thinking, mmm, seafood. Y’know?</p>
<p><strong>douglas</strong>: I’m not actually supposed to be</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Who’s talking? Honey, this is a flirting… But
you’re probably just another good-looking man wasting it all on women.
World’s full of fools.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Yahtzee!… Okay, Mr. I-Always-Have-
A-Hard-Nightstick. Put away the pictures of those underfed, white males
and let’s broaden your horizons.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I like sunsets and puppy dogs, and I’m big in
the pants. Just hope I’m not too cute for you. And don’t tell me it’s a
color thing, hon, or I’ll come over there and slap a little
discrimination right upside your yummy little cheeks.</p>
<p><strong>douglas</strong>: I’m hooked up.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Another big, hot, cuddly, black love- Jesus
got there first. That bitch. Taking you. From me.</p>
<p><strong>douglas</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Hey… This day and age, sweetie, I can
appreciate the monogamy. Saving it for your number one is keeping the
world safe, and it’s okay by me. Even if you are just breaking my heart…
Guess I’ll just have to come in here someday, let you catch me
shoplifting and resist arrest – just to have you wrestle me down and
cuff me.</p>
<p><strong>douglas</strong>: I can be pretty rough.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Don’t you get me all excited now. I was just
learning to accept my disappointment.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Tommy. But you can call me Rachel.</p>
<p><strong>douglas</strong>: Douglas. And, man, I really gotta get back
to what I’m supposed to be doing, okay?</p>
<p><strong>angle - monitors</strong>: Everything looks normal.</p>
<p><strong>angle back on tommy and douglas</strong>: Seeing Douglas is
unaware of what’s happening in the vault, Tommy relaxes.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I’ll leave you alone. But is it okay if I
just stand here and stare at the muscles I’ll be missing for the rest of
my life?</p>
<p><strong>int. elevator - continuous action</strong>: Daria gets in.
Looks back to make sure Tommy has Douglas’s attention. He does. Instead
of going up, Daria uses the key-card to access the controls to go
down.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: As the doors close, Daria shoots a
wink back at…</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: who furtively flips her the bird. Never
missing a beat with Douglas.</p>
<p><strong>int. vault anteroom - day</strong>: Fait emerges from the
hole beneath the table.</p>
<p><strong>int. vault anteroom - day</strong>: Fait holds a small
digital camera next to the room’s security camera. Mimicking the
security camera’s slow pan, Fait films the room. When he’s done….</p>
<p><strong>closeup - fait’s digital camera</strong>: We see the panning
shot of the room on the monitor. Fait pulls up an on-screen menu, clicks
on “Repeat.” Whereupon the mini-movie begins playing in a continuous
loop.</p>
<p><strong>int. vault anteroom - day</strong>: As Fait mounts his camera
in front of the security camera, Daria steps off the elevator, putting
her hair up, ready to work.</p>
<p><strong>int. lobby - security station - day</strong>: On the anteroom
monitor, we see the monitor on Fait’s camera slide into position, making
the room look empty, as Tommy continues diverting Douglas’s
attention.</p>
<p><strong>int. vault anteroom - day</strong>: Fait and Daria push the
display table aside as Miles shoves equipment bags through the hole in
the floor. Fait opens the leather bag, revealing tools, a tripod, three
steel cables and a long, rectangular box. Miles grabs a high-tech DRILL.
Begins BORING a hole high up on the vault door. Fait hands Daria the
tripod to set up, while he uncoils the steel cables, attaches them to
the wheel on the vault door. Then opens the rectangular box and lifts
out what’s inside. A surface-to-air missile. Fait sets it on the
tripod.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Out.</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: … I want to report a crime in progress.</p>
<p><strong>int. sub-foundation - day</strong>: Fait is the last one down
through the hole. Beat. He looks at the others.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Faith.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Faith.</p>
<p><strong>daria</strong>: Faith.</p>
<p><strong>int. vault anteroom - day</strong>: The SAM IGNITES with a
blinding flash and streaks across the room. The steel cables instantly
snap taut and… RIP the vault’s wheel and frozen locking mechanism right
the fuck out of the door.</p>
<p><strong>int. lobby - security station - day</strong>: They felt a
rumble. Tommy covers –</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Earthquake.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Bet you know how to hit a ten on the Richter
scale…</p>
<p><strong>int. vault anteroom - day</strong>: The crew re-emerges
through the floor to find the vault door in pieces and a hole the size
of a Sub Zero where the SAM augured into the opposite wall.</p>
<p><strong>daria</strong>: Holy shit…</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: This will trigger the silent alarm. Let’s go.
We got eleven minutes.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: … I love colored stones… Look at this…</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Two-point-seven million.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Whose shit we stealing, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Drug dealers and money launderers.</p>
<p><strong>daria</strong>: Works for me.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: This I can use.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Pow.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Go.</p>
<p><strong>int. su’s rental t-bird - day</strong>: Su’s speeding through
Los Angeles streets.</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: Your employer betrayed you. The police are on
the way. Leave the black stones.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: You know the ones I mean.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Don’t think I’ll do that.</p>
<p><strong>int. lobby - security station - day</strong>: Tommy and
Douglas hear APPROACHING SIRENS. The SIRENS STOP outside. SWAT, cops,
the works. All heading for the front door. Tommy whispers urgently into
his mike.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Shit. Five-0 at the do’. Better move my
car.</p>
<p><strong>int. vault anteroom - day</strong>: Fait grabs a bag of
jewels.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Go time. Leave the rest.</p>
<p><strong>int. lobby - security station - day</strong>: SWAT swarms in.
Tommy exits behind them.</p>
<p><strong>int./ext. limo - day</strong>: Tommy gets in. A SWAT COP
signals him.</p>
<p><strong>swat cop</strong>: Move it out.</p>
<p><strong>int. utility tunnels - day</strong>: Fait, Miles, and Daria
run.</p>
<p><strong>int. subway tunnel - day</strong>: Slam! Fait, Miles, and
Daria blast out the access door. Fait kneels, feels the track.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Stopped the trains. We’re in the rabbit hole,
they’re sending down the snakes. Daria comes with me. I got no idea
where you should go, but you know where to end up.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Faith.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Faith.</p>
<p><strong>int. subway tunnel - miles - day</strong>: running like hell.
Rounds a curve. Ahead are the rear lights of a stopped train.</p>
<p><strong>int. subway tunnel - fait and daria - day</strong>:
Approaching the front of another train, stopped at a station. Fait
signals Daria to stay put. Then pokes his head around the corner of the
train.</p>
<p><strong>fait’s pov - station platform</strong>: SWAT cops hustle
passengers off the train. One SWAT GUY helps another up to check the top
of the train. The SECOND COP jumps back down.</p>
<p><strong>swat cop #2</strong>: All clear.</p>
<p><strong>angle back</strong>: Fait turns back to Daria. Signals her to
climb up onto the top of the train. Then begins climbing after her. As
Fait reaches the driver’s window, he sees ANOTHER SWAT COP approaching
the train’s DRIVER, checking under seats, etc. Fait has to climb fast.
The SWAT Guy and the Driver getting closer. Looking up. Just as…</p>
<p><strong>int. subway train - their pov - continuous action</strong>:
Fait’s leg just clears the window. They don’t see it. But…</p>
<p><strong>int. subway tunnel - continuous action</strong>: As Fait
rolls onto the top of the train…</p>
<p><strong>int. subway train - continuous action</strong>: The NOISE
causes the SWAT Cop to react. To the Driver –</p>
<p><strong>swat cop #3</strong>: Hold it.</p>
<p><strong>swat cop #3</strong>: Train’s clear.</p>
<p><strong>int. subway tunnel - continuous action</strong>: ANOTHER SWAT
COP stands outside the Driver’s window.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Okay to go?</p>
<p><strong>swat cop #4</strong>: Just hang tight.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Nice.</p>
<p><strong>radio</strong>: All clear.</p>
<p><strong>swat cop #4</strong>: Okay. Get this train outta here.</p>
<p><strong>int. subway tunnel - miles - day</strong>: running toward the
rear of the stopped train. Leaping onto the rear steps. When… Out of
nowhere, a foot catches him in the head, sending him flying back down
onto the rails. And… There is Su in front of him.</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: The stones.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: You’ll have to come and get ’em.</p>
<p><strong>int. subway tunnel - subway car roof - day</strong>:
Rocketing underground. The tunnel ceiling whizzes by above Fait and
Daria. Intermittent tunnel fixtures just inches from their heads. Every
time the train takes a curve, they both slide toward the edge. Fait
places a calming hand on top of Daria’s. The car takes a wide curve.
Daria’s body flips to the side. She loses her grip. Screams as she
starts to fall off the train. Fait reaches for Daria, losing his grip on
his bag, which plummets off the train. Fait can’t grab her. The train
jerks again. He starts sliding away from her, off the opposite side.
Fait thrusts out both hands as far as he can. And… Just snags her at the
last second. Grips Daria’s wrists with all he’s got. They’re now draped
across the curved roof of the train. Hands in the middle. If Daria
slips, or Fait lets her go, they both die.</p>
<p><strong>int. rental t-bird - day</strong>: Su gets in. Empties Miles’
nylon bag into his lap. A fortune in gems and jewelry pours out. Su
sifts through it, increasingly agitated. What he wants isn’t there. He
throws the bag down, cursing in Chinese.</p>
<p><strong>int. subway tunnel - subway car roof - day</strong>: Fait is
at his limit. His grip starts to loosen. When the train begins to slow.
They pull into a station and stop. Fait releases Daria, and she drops to
the platform.</p>
<p><strong>ext. airport - general aviation terminal - dusk</strong>: A
stretch limo and a Cadillac Escalade wait on the tarmac next to a
Gulfstream, which has just arrived. The jet door opens, and a man
emerges with a bodyguard. The man, LING, is Asian, about forty. Emanates
grace and power. As Ling descends the steps, and two thugs from the SUV
go to retrieve baggage… A woman steps out of the waiting limo to greet
Ling. She’s also Asian. Dressed in American casual. Beautiful. SONA.
She’s not smiling. As Ling approaches her –</p>
<p><strong>ling</strong>: Enjoying California?</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Hope we’re not here long. I hate
sunshine.</p>
<p><strong>sona</strong>: We may have a problem.</p>
<p><strong>ling</strong>: The stones?</p>
<p><strong>sona</strong>: The exchange was just robbed.</p>
<p><strong>ling</strong>: … Let’s hope that was part of the plan.</p>
<p><strong>int. jewelry exchange - vault anteroom - day</strong>:
Swarming with police. When… Su steps off the elevator. He’s carrying the
bag of jewels he took from Miles. To a</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Who wants to know?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Follow me.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: You know it’s past your bedtime.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Just a little longer.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: ‘Just a little longer’… School tomorrow, baby.
Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: ‘Exit.’ ‘Quit.’ ‘Do not save.’ ‘Special.’
‘Shut down.’ Sleepy- time.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: You bag some Z’s now, you hear?</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: … Wait a second.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: I think there’s something behind your</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Oh, please, that is so lame. It’s in your
hand.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: How’d you do that?</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Angels east, angels west, north and south, do
your best. Guard her, watch her, while she rests.</p>
<p><strong>int. fait’s house - kitchen - night</strong>: Fait enters.
Vanessa’s nanny, TONITA, is there. To Tonita –</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: She’ll stay down now.</p>
<p><strong>tonita</strong>: She won’t listen to me lately. Only you.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: I’ll have a talk with her about it
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: I got some work to do in the office. You can
go on to bed.</p>
<p><strong>tonita</strong>: I’m watching TV, if you need me.</p>
<p><strong>int. fait’s bar/living room - continuous action</strong>:
Fait enters. Tommy and Daria are there.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: What the hell happened?</p>
<p><strong>int. fait’s office - continuous action</strong>: They enter.
Fait shuts the door.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Should we be considering a long vacation in a
warm, foreign climate where there’s no extradition?</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: The guy who called was only interested in the
black stones…</p>
<p><strong>daria</strong>: Christophe sold us out.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Or something.</p>
<p><strong>daria</strong>: You made it.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: By the skin of my ass. Some Chinese dude
kicked me around the motherfuckin’ block. Busted my ear piece.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Snagged my loot, too… Maybe time to</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Little ass-whuppin’s nothing. ’Least you
didn’t have to play all foxy with the rent-a-cop.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Means this is all we got.</p>
<p><strong>daria</strong>: So what do we do?</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: You all wait to hear from me.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Where’re you going?</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: To get some answers.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: I got your back.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: No. I got us into this. I’ll call you if I
need you.</p>
<p><strong>daria</strong>: Be careful.</p>
<p><strong>int. christophe’s living room - night</strong>: Christophe’s
arms are wrapped around the large fish tank, one arm over the top, the
other through the legs of the stand. His hands are bound. He can’t move.
His beaten face is pressed to the glass. Large, weird fish swim past in
front of him. The weird fish scatter as a face appears on the other side
of the tank. Ling. Looking through at Christophe. Ling straightens and
walks around the tank. Sona is with him. So is Charles, the bodyguard.
In b.g., the two thugs stand sentry near the front door. Christophe’s
eyes follow them.</p>
<p><strong>ling</strong>: So this is Mr. Christophe?</p>
<p><strong>sona</strong>: Yes. Only the handcuffs and fish tank are a
new look.</p>
<p><strong>ling</strong>: Apparently we’re not his first visitors
today.</p>
<p><strong>christophe</strong>: Please, Monsieur Ling –</p>
<p><strong>ling</strong>: Whatever you’re going to say… Make it the
truth.</p>
<p><strong>ext. archie’s american surplus - m1a1 tank - night</strong>:
Sitting in the middle of the large lot, which is full of hot goods and
military surplus equipment. The tank’s turret is spinning around. The
cannon elevating and depressing seemingly at random. When… The cannon
stops. Having locked on…Fait, standing in front of the tank. From inside
the tank, a muffled voice.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Bang.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Like it?</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: It’s cool.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Want it? Give you a good deal. Ammo
included… Reactive armor, twin M240 machine guns, 120mm smoothbore
cannon. Guaranteed to get you through the rougher areas of the city and
keep the neighbors in line.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Pass.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: How about a Marine Corps assault
hovercraft?</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: I got other business.</p>
<p><strong>man unloading hot tvs</strong>: We’re outta room over here,
Arch.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Stack ’em in the office, if you have to.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: … You weren’t downtown tonight by any
chance, were you, Tony?</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Don’t know what you’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Me either.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Ever see black diamonds before?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: White, blue, yellow, pink. Neil Diamond. Lou
Diamond Phillips. Black diamonds? Solid rocks? No.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: You got me.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Find out how much they’re worth.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: There a timetable on this, or –</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: That’s what I figured.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: I’ll be back. I gotta go fuck over a guy who
fucked me over.</p>
<p><strong>int. christophe’s apartment building - hallway -
night</strong>: Fait opens a door with an electronic lock pick.</p>
<p><strong>int. christophe’s apartment - living room -
continuous</strong>: Fait enters. Stops a moment, his back against the
closed door, while his eyes adjust to the dark. Then moves quietly out
into the room. Looking for Christophe. Fait continues moving around
through the room. When he steps in something wet. He bends down and
checks it out. Water. The carpet’s soaked. His eyes go to something.
Fait finds a cord and turns on a switch. The light in the fish tank
snaps on. REVEAL Christophe. Stuffed inside the tank. Sleeping with the
fishes.</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: Looks dead to me.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Guess you got to him first.</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: Not me. Someone else.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: … You’re the one who called me. The one who
took on my guy… Who the fuck are you, man?</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: My name is Su.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Cool. I’m Sally.</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: I want the black stones.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Yeah? Make me an offer.</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: You can walk out of here.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: … No deal.</p>
<p><strong>christophe</strong>: Christophe here. Leave a message.</p>
<p><strong>ling</strong>: I know you’re there, Mr. Fait.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Who’s this?</p>
<p><strong>int. hotel room - night</strong>: Overlooking L.A. Ling and
Sona. Enjoying hotel room service. Ling’s on a cell phone.</p>
<p><strong>ling</strong>: The man for whom Mr. Christophe arranged to
have the black stones brought into the country and deposited at the
jewelry exchange. The man who wants them back. Now.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Fine. How much?</p>
<p><strong>ling</strong>: Maybe you didn’t understand me. The stones are
already mine.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: I got ’em, I’m selling ’em. So get your bid in
or go fuck yourself.</p>
<p><strong>ling</strong>: I don’t have time for this.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: That your final offer?</p>
<p><strong>ling</strong>: I can be a very dangerous man, Mr. Fait.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Everybody think I’m the fucking Goodwill or
something…? Look, I’ve had a shitty night, and so far, I got zip for all
my troubles. So I don’t know who the fuck you are, and I don’t care. But
hear this: you can beat my ass around the block all night – Brother, it
ain’t gonna get you those stones.</p>
<p><strong>ext. street near christophe’s - night</strong>: Fait slides
into his Porsche and drives off.</p>
<p><strong>int./ext. fait’s porsche - night</strong>: Fait’s checking
his rearview mirror. Sees a black Cadillac Escalade pull away from the
curb and follow. Fait doesn’t need it.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Oh, man…</p>
<p><strong>int./ext. escalade - continuous action</strong>: Finally
forcing its way through on-coming traffic and speeding down the alley
after Fait. The ESCALADE reaches the intersection. Turns. And… CRASHES
into a DUMPSTER rolled into its path. The dumpster forces the Escalade
into a wall.</p>
<p><strong>ext. alley - continuous action</strong>: Two men start to get
out of the Escalade. We recognize them: Ling’s two thugs. We barely have
time to realize that Fait’s escape has been blocked by construction
equipment down the alley. He’s had no choice but to turn and fight.</p>
<p><strong>ling thug #1</strong>: Give us the stones.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Man, how many times I gotta tell people: I’m a
business man. Make me a motherfucking offer.</p>
<p><strong>ling thug #2</strong>: Here’s your offer.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: That shit ain’t gonna do it, biggie. ’Cause I
ain’t scared of guns, and I ain’t got the stones.</p>
<p><strong>ling thug #1</strong>: Then you’re gonna tell us where they
are.</p>
<p><strong>bottle</strong>: Spins through the air. The bottle knocks the
gun from one Killer’s hand. The gun skids under a nearby chain-link
fence.</p>
<p><strong>reveal</strong>: the person who threw the bar. Su. The
fight’s on. Two on</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: Over here.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Man, what the hell’s up with these fucking
stones? Go.</p>
<p><strong>int. archie’s american surplus - office - night</strong>:
Archie’s had the shit beat out of him.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: It’s Archie. Bad news. We got a problem.</p>
<p><strong>closeup - video monitor</strong>: Surveillance camera footage
of Archie’s.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: … I did what you said, right? Put it out on
the street, trying to get info on the stones. Next thing I know, the
Jackson Five here show up… Now, there are three significant elements to
notice here. One, I’m outnumbered. Two, they’re heavily armed. Three,
they’re gonna beat me like a bongo drum…</p>
<p><strong>int. archie’s american surplus - office - night</strong>:
Archie, Fait and Su are watching the monitor. On screen, Archie
surrenders immediately.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: … I mean, hey, I coulda resisted, sure – and
they coulda beat me into a coma or killed me or whatever – but then,
see, I’m thinking: How would I be able to tell Tony what happened to the
stones? Right? What good am I dead or on life-support. So I threw in the
towel. Reluctantly, of course. For your sake.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Okay. You saved yourself to tell me. So tell
me.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Who are they?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Uh… Don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: What’d they say?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Well… ‘Give us the stones, motherfucker.’
You know. That kinda thing.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: That’s it?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Pretty much. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Thanks for keeping yourself alive to pass on
all that valuable information.</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: Did you call the police?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Look around. Are you crazy? Then again,
maybe you are crazy, ’cause I have no idea who you are.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Big question is, who’s behind the boost?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: I don’t know that, but I know they got great
guns. I can’t even get those. U.S. Special Forces only.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: … Chambers.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: He’s wired into everything going down in this
city, and he can get that kind of firepower. Gotta be him.</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: Who’s Chambers?</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Runs the biggest outfit in town. What warlords
are to Afghanistan, Chambers is to L.A… And you want to take him on,
you’re on your own. Game over for me. And now that I’m truly fucked –
what the hell are you, anyway? You got some I.D.?</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Doesn’t mean shit to me.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Let me see that.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Taiwan. Central Security Bureau. Taiwanese
intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: You read Chinese?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: No. But I know ‘cop’ in every language.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: What, you some kinda Asian James Bond?</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: The stones belong to my government.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Yeah, well, they’re Chambers’ now. And even
governments don’t go to war with him.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: I’m starting to hate this phone. What now?</p>
<p><strong>ling</strong>: I hope you’ve reconsidered.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Hey, it’s Mr. Dangerous. ‘Sup, ’homie’?</p>
<p><strong>ling</strong>: You’ve made this difficult, Mr. Fait. Let me
make it easy.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Can’t wait to hear.</p>
<p><strong>ling</strong>: I have your daughter.</p>
<p><strong>ling</strong>: She’s very pretty in her pink pajamas. Aren’t
you, Vanessa?</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Daddy!</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Vanessa!</p>
<p><strong>ling</strong>: I want my stones, Mr. Fait.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Motherfucker…</p>
<p><strong>ling</strong>: You think about it a moment. Let me talk to
the Chinese gentleman who’s with you.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Don’t you hurt her.</p>
<p><strong>ling</strong>: That’s up to you… The Chinese</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: He has my daughter.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Oh, Jesus…</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: He wants to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>ling</strong>: I thought I killed you.</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: I have the stones. No negotiations. Let the girl
go.</p>
<p><strong>ling</strong>: Do you really want one more person to die?</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: No negotiations.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: What’d you just do? What happened?</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: I said I have the stones and won’t negotiate for
your daughter.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: You what?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Oh, Jesus…</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: It will confuse him. Buy us time and keep her
alive.</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: Look – I know him. I want the stones, you want
your daughter. We’ll get them both back. We’ll work together.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: … I gotta work with you?</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: You have no choice.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: … Shit… We gotta go see Chambers… Oh, god…
Vanessa…</p>
<p><strong>int. airplane hangar - night</strong>: Large, empty,
brightly-lit. The door opens, and the limo pulls in.</p>
<p><strong>int./ext. limousine - continuous action</strong>: The limo
stops inside the hangar. To Charles, re: Vanessa –</p>
<p><strong>ling</strong>: Find a place to put her.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: My daddy’s gonna come and kick your
butts.</p>
<p><strong>ling</strong>: Su says he has the stones… But why cut me off?
Why not negotiate for the girl? It doesn’t make sense.</p>
<p><strong>ling</strong>: We’ll never regain their confidence. We need
information. Find the right people. Pay whatever it costs. Something’s
not right. Something’s happening with the stones.</p>
<p><strong>sona</strong>: What about the girl?</p>
<p><strong>ling</strong>: We’ll need her… She stays alive. For now.</p>
<p><strong>int. fait’s porsche - night</strong>: In motion. Fait and Su.
Fait on the cell to Tommy.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: I’m on the way to Chambers… Yeah, I know, but
I got no other choice. Just get the word into his pipeline that I’m
coming and want permission to visit… I’ll get back to you… Faith… Maybe
Chambers’ll have a heart and give the stones back. Yeah, right – and
maybe he’ll join the Peace Corps.</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: I’m sorry about your daughter… How old is
she?</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: This ain’t the Biography Channel. Let’s just
get there.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Eight. She’ll be nine in September.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Never happen. I’ll just kill ’em.</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: I wish it were that easy.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: About time I got the 4-1-1.</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: 4-1-1?</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: What’s this all about?</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: The stones aren’t what you think they are.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: No shit. How about the guy who has
Vanessa?</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: He’s exactly what you think he is – a thief and
a killer.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Great…</p>
<p><strong>int. hangar - night</strong>: A battered Ford camper now sits
in the middle of the hangar. We see Vanessa inside the camper. She’s
screaming. Loudly. Not scared. Pissed. As… Ling Thug #2 covers the
windows with black spray paint.</p>
<p><strong>angle - across hangar</strong>: Ling Thug #2 hands car keys
to Charles.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Where’d you get that piece of shit?</p>
<p><strong>ling thug #1</strong>: Let’s just say Grandma and Grandpa
have a long walk back from the</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: You’re sure you cleaned it out?</p>
<p><strong>ling thug #1</strong>: Everything except the denture cream
and adult diapers.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: I’m sick of her already.</p>
<p><strong>int./ext. camper - continuous action</strong>: Vanessa is
standing inside, still yelling.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: You shut up!</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Go to sleep!</p>
<p><strong>closeup - fait</strong>: As he drives, just as if he can
sense Vanessa’s need for him –</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Angels east, angels west, north and south, do
your best. Guard her, watch her, while she rests.</p>
<p><strong>int. medium security prison - cellblock - day</strong>: A
prison guard escorts Fait and Su past cells, each just as dreary, spare
and institutional as the next. That is, until they reach the last cell.
The last cell is guarded by two convict sentries. Hanging blankets cloak
the cell entirely from view. Fait, Su and the prison guard stop outside
the cell. One sentry blocks the way in as the other parts the blankets
covering the open cell doorway, REVEALING…</p>
<p><strong>int./ext. chamber’s cell - continuous action</strong>: After
a walk through Kansas, this is the land of Oz. The last cell is as
comfy, colorful and a well-appointed as Joel’s office. JUMP CHAMBERS, a
large, brutal-looking, inner-city crime lord has clearly used money and
influence to improve the terms of his incarceration. Chambers puffs a
Cuban as a prison trustee, WILLY CHICKENS, sets out breakfast before
him: fresh-squeezed OJ; eggs benedict; large, juicy sausages; fresh
breads and pastries; French-press coffee; LA TIMES, NY TIMES, WSJ,
Maxim, Hustler and the daily mail. The guard leaves Fait and Su, turns
to go.</p>
<p><strong>chambers</strong>: Metz.</p>
<p><strong>chambers</strong>: D.V.D.’s broke.</p>
<p><strong>metz</strong>: Get you a new one straight away,
Mr. Chambers.</p>
<p><strong>chambers</strong>: Thanks for your patience. Man needs his
nightly rest. Who’s the gook?</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: … Chinese guy.</p>
<p><strong>chambers</strong>: … No shoes in my crib.</p>
<p><strong>chambers</strong>: In.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: How you doing, Jump?</p>
<p><strong>chambers</strong>: Don’t waste my precious time.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: … I got a problem.</p>
<p><strong>chambers</strong>: How’s Daria?</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: … Good.</p>
<p><strong>chambers</strong>: Always was good. From the moment I found
her till the moment you took her away from me. Problem, you say?</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: … The black stones.</p>
<p><strong>chambers</strong>: Bitch brought it in. Made me a lotta
money. But that all stopped. You stopped that. You decided it was okay
to put an end to that. Black stones. Go on.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: I need ’em back.</p>
<p><strong>chambers</strong>: Only smart thing was not pimping her
yourself, ’cause then I’da been real sore-angry, and you’da both been
real cold-dead…</p>
<p><strong>chambers</strong>: But you don’t pimp, do you? Just a</p>
<p><strong>chambers</strong>: You like tall white women?</p>
<p><strong>chambers</strong>: He can’t talk?</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: I don’t speak Korean.</p>
<p><strong>chambers</strong>: Bought myself this Korean club downtown.
Packing in the Seoul brothers 24-7-365… Black man gouging Koreans, ain’t
that a switch… Motherfuckers got faces like walls, but they love to
drink liquor and look at naked girls… Place is no shitbox, either. Got
me an office looks like a kabuki love palace. My own little sanctuary
–</p>
<p><strong>chambers</strong>: – just waiting for when I parole out… Stop
by sometime, eyeball the poon.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: … Jump, my daughter’s mixed up in this. I
gotta have the stones, or she’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: If you need something more than that, here it
is… I’m begging you, Jump.</p>
<p><strong>chambers</strong>: Big heist. Risky heist. Breaking news. I’m
watching it wondering why.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: She’s my little girl.</p>
<p><strong>chambers</strong>: Make another one… Lotta offspring running
around. Big scores’re rare in a lifetime.</p>
<p><strong>chambers</strong>: Slope’s no dope.</p>
<p><strong>chickens</strong>: Let me cut one of these motherfuckers.</p>
<p><strong>chambers</strong>: Your choice.</p>
<p><strong>chambers</strong>: Say hey to Daria. And don’t forget your
shoes.</p>
<p><strong>ext. prison - day</strong>: Fait and Su walk toward the
Porsche.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: I used to look up to that guy. All I wanted
was to be like him.</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: In Taiwan, I could force him to talk.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: This ain’t Taiwan. Only thing we can do now is
find out where the stones are and go take ’em.</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: You make it sound easy.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: It won’t be.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: … They’re at his club.</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: I know. I can feel it. That ever happen to
you?</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: I thought Chinese people were all mystical and
shit.</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: We like to gamble. Not guess.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: It’s no guess… But I could be wrong… We’ll hit
the club. You gotta see Archie.</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: Archie?</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: He’s gotta remember something about the guys
who took down his place.</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: What if he can’t?</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Pretend it’s Taiwan. Make him remember.</p>
<p><strong>int. hangar - day</strong>: RUSSELL, the science and
technology end of Ling’s operation, carries a piece of equipment from
the back of a five-ton truck and approaches some kind of strange
contraption, which he’s in the process of erecting in the middle of the
hangar. He puts down what he’s carrying next to the contraption and
starts back for something else, when he sees Charles is looking in the
back of the truck.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Hey! Get away from there!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: What are you doing?!</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Whoa. Take it easy. Just seeing if I could
help with something.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: You can’t! It’s very delicate equipment!
Stay away! Just stay away from my truck!</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Stay away from my truck!</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Stay away from my truck!</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>sona</strong>: Stop it.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: I want my daddy!</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: I’m backing away… I’m backing away…</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: I want my daddy! I want my daddy!</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Someone give the geek his Ritalin.</p>
<p><strong>sona</strong>: At least he’s doing his job. Which is more
than I can say for some people.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: I want my daddy! I want my daddy!</p>
<p><strong>sona</strong>: Tape her up and gag her.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: I want my daddy! I want my daddy! I want my
daddy!</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Get the hell off me.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: … Waste of time… I can think of a better
way of shutting you up –</p>
<p><strong>ext. camper - continuous action</strong>: THUNK go the DOOR
LOCKS. Charles, still in pain, is surprised to hear this. Feels his
pocket. Realizes the key and remote are gone.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Shit. She got the key!</p>
<p><strong>int. camper - continuous action</strong>: Vanessa climbs into
the driver’s seat. Puts the key into the ignition and STARTS the ENGINE.
Puts it in “D.”</p>
<p><strong>closeup - accelerator pedal</strong>: To reveal Vanessa’s
rigged a soda can to the pedal. An extension for her short legs. As her
foot tromps down on the can…</p>
<p><strong>angle - camper</strong>: takes off. The windows are blacked
out and Vanessa can’t see where she’s going. But she’s going.</p>
<p><strong>int. hangar - continuous action</strong>: The camper careens

toward the rear wall. And… … CRASHES into a support post. As Charles
yanks Vanessa from the wrecked van, unhurt…</p>
<p><strong>int. korean club - day</strong>: A hostess bar, but very
high-end. Beautiful women. Elegant decor. Pumping MUSIC. No strip-club
cheese. For extra money, private rooms for private pleasures. It’s day,
but the place is wall-to-wall with Korean men. Chambers’
African-Americans maintain low visibility: at the door, behind the
scenes, counting the register, etc. ODION, a dangerous-looking Chambers
main man, moves through the crowd to Daria, waiting near the front
door.</p>
<p><strong>odion</strong>: Delicious Daria.</p>
<p><strong>daria</strong>: ’Sup, Odion?</p>
<p><strong>odion</strong>: Long time no see.</p>
<p><strong>odion</strong>: Like cognac. Just getting better. So what
brings you around?</p>
<p><strong>daria</strong>: … Sometimes you need an old friend,
y’know?</p>
<p><strong>odion</strong>: Got trouble?</p>
<p><strong>daria</strong>: … With a capital ‘T.’</p>
<p><strong>odion</strong>: Tony Fait? Thought you and him were tight.
Bonnie and Clyde.</p>
<p><strong>daria</strong>: Used to be that way. Not treating me right
these days. The kid’s all he cares about.</p>
<p><strong>odion</strong>: … What do you want me to do?</p>
<p><strong>daria</strong>: … Man, I don’t know. Probably nothing you can
do. I just</p>
<p><strong>odion</strong>: Nah, hey, hold up. It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>daria</strong>: Back in the day… Just always seemed like you
and I had something special between us.</p>
<p><strong>odion</strong>: Didn’t know you thought so.</p>
<p><strong>daria</strong>: I always cared for you, Odion. That’s why I’m
here.</p>
<p><strong>odion</strong>: … You looking for a job?</p>
<p><strong>daria</strong>: I need something.</p>
<p><strong>odion</strong>: … So maybe you could work here.</p>
<p><strong>daria</strong>: Here?… Oh, man, I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>odion</strong>: You were the best. Not many girls pulling in
two g’s a night.</p>
<p><strong>daria</strong>: Yeah, but it’s been a while for that… Might
not remember how.</p>
<p><strong>odion</strong>: Just like a bicycle, baby. You don’t forget
that stuff.</p>
<p><strong>daria</strong>: Don’t know how Jump’d feel about it. Having
me back.</p>
<p><strong>odion</strong>: Hey, you let me worry about Jump,</p>
<p><strong>daria</strong>: … Just talk?</p>
<p><strong>odion</strong>: … No.</p>
<p><strong>int. su’s t-bird - day</strong>: Su and Archie.</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: They have boxing matches in the day?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Not exactly boxing. More dangerous. No
gloves. No rules. Big money. Very illegal… Started holding ’em during
the daytime to fool the cops.</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: The man you remembered – how do you know he will
be here?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: I don’t. But Chambers owns the operation, so
I figure it’s a good place to start. This is it.</p>
<p><strong>ext. fight club - continuous action</strong>: A cavernous
industrial building. Cars parked on the perimeter.</p>
<p><strong>int./ext. su’s t-bird - continuous action</strong>: As they
park –</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: How will you recognize him?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: I didn’t see his face. But I’ll know his
pinkie ring when I see it. Ten carats. Round cut with square mount. Good
color and clarity. I remember thinking what it would do to my face if he
hit me.</p>
<p><strong>int. fight club - continuous action</strong>: Archie and Su
exit the car and approach a GUARD manning a gate to the fight arena
beyond.</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: How do we get in?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Leave that to me.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Hey, man, how you doing? Got a fighter here
I want to enter.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: My man’s gonna put the rest of these bums to
beddy-bye. He’ll go in there and get all Chinese on ’em – the teeth are
gonna fly, the blood’s gonna run… Gonna be fun.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Whatever… You’re number twelve, Bruce.</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: I didn’t come here to fight.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: You won’t have to. That was just to get us
in.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Good day, over a million dollars’ll pass
hands in here.</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: Find the ring.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Yeah. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Could take a little while.</p>
<p><strong>int. private room - day</strong>: Daria and Odion enter, and
Odion closes the door. He starts to take her in his arms. Daria slows
him up. Guides him back toward a sofa.</p>
<p><strong>daria</strong>: Sit down.</p>
<p><strong>daria</strong>: Put on some music.</p>
<p><strong>daria</strong>: Nah. Something slower.</p>
<p><strong>daria</strong>: That’s good… Now just relax… And watch…</p>
<p><strong>ext. rooftop - day</strong>: Fait and Miles climb onto the
roof with gear bags. Via earwig mike –</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Tommy.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Here come da bug man.</p>
<p><strong>ext. korean club - street in front - day</strong>: The
DOORMAN watches Tommy drive up in the pest-control truck, put on a
respirator, get out, unreel 20 feet of pest spray hose from the truck
and advance toward the door.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Hey. Howzit?</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: What the hell you doing?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Pest control. Don’t tell me you didn’t get
your notice.</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: What notice?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: See, that burns my ass right to the bone. I
mean, hey, I’m here doing my job… Anyway, putting that aside, if you had
gotten your notice, you’d know there’s a new city ordinance saying all
businesses catering to foreigners gotta be sprayed.</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: Yeah? How come?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: ’Cause foreign people’re bringing all</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: We’re doing business inside. Can’t let you
just start hosing the place with bug spray.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Yeah, well, maybe you should at least ask the
manager about it.</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: Manager’s busy.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: … Okay. Your call. Just know the city
quarantine people’ll be here first thing tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: Quarantine people?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: They’ll be shutting you down for non-
compliance… Peace out.</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: Wait, wait, wait.</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: City’s really gonna come and close us
up?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Quicker’n a Zip-loc.</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: … You sure you’re not fucking with me?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I’m a licensed exterminator. Why would I be
fucking with you?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Look. Let’s do this. You let me start with a
couple small rooms, y’know, offices or something, someplace you don’t
have customers. Upstairs, so the fumes don’t bother anybody. I’ll pop
off a couple bug bombs, and then we’ll do the rest later. How’s
that?</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: … Yeah, okay. Get the bombs, and come
on.</p>
<p><strong>int. private room - day</strong>: Daria keeps dancing.
Peeling off layers now. Showing skin. Odion’s starting to salivate.</p>
<p><strong>int. chambers’ office - day</strong>: What Chambers’ cell is
to a normal cell, this place is to a normal office. No expense spared. A
large, “Zen” FOUNTAIN BURBLES meditatively in the center of the room.
The door opens. The Doorman admits Tommy, who looks around in
amazement.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: … Look. At. This.</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: Just do your thing and go, bro.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Roger that.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Just keep the door closed and be sure to give
this shit a full hour before anyone comes in.</p>
<p><strong>ext. rooftop - day</strong>: Fait and Miles grab gear bags
and mobilize. Clip onto ascender/descenders and lower themselves to a
second-story window. A window into…</p>
<p><strong>int. chambers’ office - continuous action</strong>: Where the
BUG BOMBS HISS away. Fait tries the WINDOW. Locked shut. He quickly
tapes it. BREAKS it. He and Miles climbs inside. Grab the bug bombs and
toss them out. As Miles locks the door, Fait opens a gear bag and pulls
out a folding metal detector. Uses it to scan the entire room quickly:
floor, walls, ceiling… Gets LOW-VOLUME RING-OFFS from various hidden
metal. But he’s looking for something bigger. BLEEE. He gets it when he
sweeps past Chambers’ big desk.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Safe.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Take it down.</p>
<p><strong>int. private room - day</strong>: Daria’s down to bare
essentials – still dancing slow and sexy for Odion.</p>
<p><strong>int. chambers’ office - day</strong>: Miles loads one of the
massive D.U. cartridges into the Barrett.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Even with the music, they’re gonna hear it
when I fire this tank buster.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Daria. Get ready to move.</p>
<p><strong>int. private room - day</strong>: Odion starts.</p>
<p><strong>odion</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>int. private room - night</strong>: Odion’s heading out the
door. When he stops. Looks back at Daria. A realization dawning.</p>
<p><strong>odion</strong>: ‘Sometimes you need an old friend’…</p>
<p><strong>chambers man</strong>: It came from the office.</p>
<p><strong>odion</strong>: Watch her. Don’t let her leave.</p>
<p><strong>int. chambers’ office - day</strong>: Fait’s tossed the safe.
No stones.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Not here?</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: They’re here. Somewhere else.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: What’re you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: I’m telling you, they’re here.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: What’re we gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Everyone out.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: What about you?</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: I gotta save Vanessa. I gotta find ’em.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: I’m not leaving you.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Yes, you are. Go. Now.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: T. Come on, man. They’re outside. Give it
up.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Shut up and get the fuck outta here! That’s an
order!</p>
<p><strong>int. private room - night</strong>: Daria finishes dressing.
When…</p>
<p><strong>chambers man</strong>: … Y’know, I got the big one…</p>
<p><strong>daria</strong>: Keep it in your pants.</p>
<p><strong>int. chambers’ office - day</strong>: CRASH! Odion and his
men break down the door.</p>
<p><strong>int. korean club - day</strong>: Daria walks out the front
door.</p>
<p><strong>chambers</strong>: … If you’re willing to pay five, you’re
willing to pay ten.</p>
<p><strong>chambers</strong>: You’re willing to pay ten, you’re willing
to pay twenty. Twenty, forty. Forty, eighty… I’m not selling till I know
exactly where the ceiling is.</p>
<p><strong>chambers</strong>: You like foreplay?</p>
<p><strong>ling</strong>: How much money do you want for the stones?</p>
<p><strong>chambers</strong>: I hate foreplay. Fuck the warm-up drills –
girl’s gotta get in there and be ready to score points. Bring it
straight to the motherfucking hoop. You understand? So, instead of us
going back and forth doing warm-ups, my idea’s for you to think of a
number. A very high number. A very final number. A number so high and
final it’ll get me off good, bam, right when I hear it.</p>
<p><strong>chambers</strong>: Okay, okay…</p>
<p><strong>chambers</strong>: Ain’t worth my life… I’ll take the five
and call it a game.</p>
<p><strong>int. cellblock - outside chambers’ cell - moments
later</strong>: Ling emerges from the cell through the blankets. Closing
the blankets behind him. To the sentries, who’ve heard nothing –</p>
<p><strong>ling</strong>: Mr. Chambers is resting. He says not to bother
him.</p>
<p><strong>int. chambers’ cell - day</strong>: FIND Chambers. No one
will bother him. Ever. The lobster fork driven deep into the base of his
skull.</p>
<p><strong>int. fight club - day</strong>: Archie still looking for the
man with the diamond pinkie-ring. Su still following.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: … By the way, when we do find him, what
then?</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: I’ll handle it.</p>
<p><strong>ring announcer</strong>: Seven advances, eleven’s out… Next
up, eight versus twelve. Eight versus twelve. Fighters report to the
cage.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: You’re after the stones, too, huh?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: … I did some more checking around to see
what anyone knows about ’em… Guess who get back to me? My Defense
Department connection. Now, I think he’s calling me about this surplus
F- 14 Tomcat I’m trying to get my hands on. But no. Turns out he’s
calling to tell me about a rumor outta Taiwan about black stones –</p>
<p><strong>ring announcer</strong>: Number twelve!</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: – only they’re not jewels –</p>
<p><strong>ring announcer</strong>: Number twelve!</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: They’re –</p>
<p><strong>fight club fan</strong>: Twelve’s right here!</p>
<p><strong>fight club fan</strong>: I’d be scared of him, too.</p>
<p><strong>bruiser</strong>: Let’s go, chickenshit!</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: Not today…</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: I know it wasn’t the plan. But if you don’t
fight, they’re gonna toss us out on our asses. We might never find the
guy.</p>
<p><strong>int. korean club - day</strong>: Fait’s in handcuffs. A big
cut on his head. Being escorted by two COPS to the stairs leading out of
the club. To Odion, as they pass him –</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: He’s pretty beat up.</p>
<p><strong>odion</strong>: Yeah. Fell down the stairs… Enjoy the jail
sex, Fait.</p>
<p><strong>cop #2</strong>: Better have the E.M.T.s look at his
head.</p>
<p><strong>ext. hot dog stand - continuous action</strong>: Near, but
not too close. The club visible in b.g. Daria, Miles, and Tommy watch as
Fait is led into an ambulance. Via earwigs –</p>
<p><strong>daria</strong>: We’re still here to help you, T.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Anything you want us to do?</p>
<p><strong>int. ambulance - continuous action</strong>: Fait’s
heard.</p>
<p><strong>paramedic</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>closeup - behind fait’s back</strong>: His cuffed hands.
Fingers feeling the inside of his belt. Finding a spot where a small
rectangle has been cut into the leather. Popping out the rectangle to
reveal a hollowed-out recess in the belt. Where… Fait has a hidden
handcuff key.</p>
<p><strong>closeup - another set of hands</strong>: struggling against
their duct-tape bonds. REVEAL…</p>
<p><strong>int. camper - day</strong>: Vanessa’s hands are taped
together behind her back. There’s tape around her feet. Tape over her
mouth. The TV is ON nearby, but she’s not watching. Vanessa struggles a
moment longer, but can’t break the tape. Finally gives up trying. Just
lies there. Tired and scared.</p>
<p><strong>int. fight club - day</strong>: DING! The crowd’s yelling and
betting as number eight leaves his corner and advances on Su. Su has
nothing against number eight. He’s just trying to buy time. So he dodges
his opponent. Not exactly running. Fighting by not fighting. A target
one moment, gone the next. Again and again, number eight swings and
misses. Until… Number eight delivers a knockout blow. Unfortunately it’s
against himself. The momentum of a missed punch carries him headfirst
into a metal post. Number eight drops. As the referee counts over number
eight, Su uses the chance to find…</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: still checking out the hands of
African-American men in the crowd. Not making any friends as he does
it.</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: Number eight’s on his feet. Moving in again.
When…</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Suddenly, he sees it. The ring.</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: dodges number eight again. Then… Sees Archie
signaling he’s found the guy. And… Gets nailed by number eight. A solid
hit. Exciting the crowd and pumping up number eight. Whereupon… Su turns
to him and bows.</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: You win.</p>
<p><strong>ring announcer</strong>: No quitting. Get back in there.</p>
<p><strong>hot dog stand - day</strong>: Daria, Tommy and Miles wait.
Two extreme MOTO-RIDERS dressed in leathers have pulled up in a truck
and gotten out to eat. In the back of the truck is a motorcycle and a
four-wheel ATV. The two men Ogle Daria. To her –</p>
<p><strong>moto-rider #1</strong>: Looking good.</p>
<p><strong>moto-rider #2</strong>: Nice rack.</p>
<p><strong>moto-rider #1</strong>: Like the upstairs, like the
basement,</p>
<p><strong>daria</strong>: Shut up, assholes…</p>
<p><strong>int. ambulance - continuous action</strong>: Fait’s heard.
Looks past the Paramedic. Past the Cops talking outside. Sees the hot
dog stand in b.g. Sees the truck with the motorcycle and ATV parked near
the stand. The Paramedic finishes bandaging Fait. To the cops outside
–</p>
<p><strong>paramedic</strong>: He’s all patched up.</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Get ready to move.</p>
<p><strong>ext. ambulance - continuous action</strong>: Fait reaches the
rear doorway. When… He jumps. Knocks one Cop down. Shoves another aside.
And takes off running. Fait’s caught the cops completely by surprise. It
takes a few moments before the cops give chase, some on foot, others by
car.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: Fait runs toward the truck parked by
the hot dog stand. To Daria, Miles and Tommy, looking on –</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Get the car. Stay close.</p>
<p><strong>moto-rider #1</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>moto-rider #1</strong>: Don’t let that fucker get away!</p>
<p><strong>int. camper - day</strong>: Vanessa still taped up. TV still
ON. When…</p>
<p><strong>tv anchor</strong>: … We go now to this breaking story…</p>
<p><strong>angle to include tv</strong>: Airing a chopper shot tracking
Fait on the ATV.</p>
<p><strong>tv anchor</strong>: … You’re watching a man on an all-
terrain vehicle leading police in a high-speed chase through downtown
Los Angeles. An L.A.P.D. spokesman says the man, Anthony Fait –</p>
<p><strong>tv anchor</strong>: – commandeered the A.T.V. after escaping
from police officers while being treated at a local hospital for
injuries resulting from his earlier arrest for robbery… And this is
certainly one of the wildest chases we’ve witnessed here in L.A…</p>
<p><strong>int. fight club - day</strong>: The place is bedlam. In the
crowd, bets are going down on the battle royal, now in full effect
inside the cage. Su versus the five fighters. And the midget. The
different fighters use different fighting styles against Su. Kickboxing,
grappling, aikido, kali, American street fighting… Su uses all his own
skills and whatever’s at hand. At one point he engineers it so one
opponent turns on another opponent. At another point, Su wields the
midget like a fighting staff. One by one, Su starts reducing the
opposition.</p>
<p><strong>ext. downtown los angeles - various shots - day</strong>:
Fait’s everywhere. And so is the moto-bike. Still on his tail. Fait
veers inside a building. The bike follows.</p>
<p><strong>int. building - various shots - continuous action</strong>:
Fait and the moto-bike ascend the stairs. One floor. Two floors. Up and
up. Fait reaches the top-floor hallway. Nowhere left to go except… Out
the window at the end. And… That’s just where he goes.</p>
<p><strong>ext. downtown los angeles - rooftops - continuous</strong>:
The ATV and the moto-bike make the first leap. Onto the roof of a
next-door building. From there, it’s rooftop to rooftop. Jump after
jump. Longer and longer. Until… The MOTO-BIKE eats it in a spectacular
CRASH. The moto- rider walks away, but his chase is over.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Yo.</p>
<p><strong>daria</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Above ground parking garage in Chinatown?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Know it.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Get there.</p>
<p><strong>int. fight club - day</strong>: It’s down to Su and the kick
boxer. The kick boxer spins and kicks and punches, and… Su just ties the
guy up in his own clothes. Ties him into a pretzel. Cinches him tight.
Then… Looks for Archie. Can’t find him. Can’t find the guy wearing the
ring. And hurries out of the cage.</p>
<p><strong>ext. parking garage - day</strong>: Fait jukes the ATV in the
entrance. Up the spiral ramp.</p>
<p><strong>tv anchor</strong>: … And it looks like this chase will end
here, as police seal off the building…</p>
<p><strong>int. fight club - day</strong>: Su runs into the parking
area. Archie’s in the T-bird. Sitting, a little unnaturally in the
front.</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Decided to leave early.</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: Where’d he go?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Right here.</p>
<p><strong>angle - car</strong>: Where Archie sits atop the man with the
diamond pinkie ring. Holding a STUN GUN to the guy’s cheek.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Good thing I brought my stunner.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Okay, bud, wanna start the Q and A?</p>
<p><strong>int. camper - day</strong>: On TV, the chopper zooms in on a
familiar car, as it rolls down the exit ramp toward the police
barricade.</p>
<p><strong>tv anchor</strong>: … Here’s a car coming down the exit
ramp…</p>
<p><strong>tv anchor</strong>: … The police apparently talking to the
driver…</p>
<p><strong>tv anchor</strong>: … Now letting this car drive on as the
search inside continues…</p>
<p><strong>ext. near korean club - hot dog stand - night</strong>: The
gang’s all here. All eyes on the club.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: I knew the stones were in there.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Question is, how do we get ’em out? Place is
slamming nonstop.</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: Something isn’t right.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Yeah. That’s what I’m getting.</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: The doorman.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: … Where the hell is he? Everyone stay put.</p>
<p><strong>int. korean club - upstairs hall - night</strong>: MUSIC
pumps downstairs as Su and Fait cautiously move down the hall toward
Chambers’ office.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: No Chambers’ guys. I don’t get it.</p>
<p><strong>int. chambers’ office - continuous action</strong>: Su and
Fait enter, unchallenged, to find… Odion and the other Chambers’ men.
Dead. Skull shot.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: I get it now.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Are they there?</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: No. This can’t fucking happen. They gotta be
there.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: … What? That’s it?</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: The rest are gone.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: … What the hell happened? Who got ’em?</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: … Ling.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: … How’d he get here before us?</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: He’s good.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Vanessa… He has the stones. There’s no reason
to keep her. Hell, she’s a little girl, she’s eight years old – she
can’t hurt him. He can let her go… He can just fucking let her go…</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: … What the hell am I gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: … We need to go.</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>int. hangar - night</strong>: Ling pours the black stones out
on a table. To Sona and Charles –</p>
<p><strong>ling</strong>: We’re back in business.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Good. I don’t have to baby-sit much
longer.</p>
<p><strong>sona</strong>: I hate kids.</p>
<p><strong>ling</strong>: Is everything else ready?</p>
<p><strong>sona</strong>: We just have to test the device.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Dye master oscillator. And not test,
calibrate. Which I’m now ready to do… Goggles.</p>
<p><strong>int. camper - night</strong>: Vanessa succeeds in using the
necklace as a saw to free her wrists from the duct-tape. She quickly
rips the tape from her mouth. Untapes her ankles. Then tries to figure
out what to do next. Begins searching the camper for anything that might
help her escape or fight. When… Looking through the glove box, she finds
a cell phone. An old model. So old, it takes her a moment to figure out
exactly what it is. Then she pushes “Power,” and… The phone turns on.
Sort of.</p>
<p><strong>int. fait’s living room - night</strong>: Rock bottom.</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: … I lost the stones. Ling has them… I don’t know
where he is… I have no way to find him… What do you want me to do?</p>
<p><strong>int. camper - night</strong>: Vanessa’s on the old cell
phone. We hear RINGING on the other end.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: … Answer, Daddy, answer…</p>
<p><strong>closeup - phone</strong>: “Low Batt”… “Low Batt”…</p>
<p><strong>int. fait’s living room - night</strong>: The PHONE’S still
RINGING. After another moment…</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Want me to get that?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>int. camper - night</strong>: Vanessa whispers urgently.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Daddy?</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Vanessa!</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Come get me! Please! I want to go home!</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Okay, baby, okay. Just calm down.</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: I’ll call you back.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: I don’t know. I’m in a van inside a big
building. They painted the windows. I can’t look out.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Try. Try to see something.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa’s pov</strong>: Few details. Just some chairs and
bright green light from Russell’s contraption.</p>
<p><strong>closeup - vanessa’s phone</strong>: “Low Batt”… “Low
Batt”…</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: I see chairs. And there’s green light.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: You see chairs and green light? Where’s the
light coming from?</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: I can’t tell.</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: Is it bright?</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: The green light, baby – is it bright?</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Yeah. Really, really bright.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: It’s real bright.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Daddy, hurry! I’m scared!</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: I know, baby. Just hang in there</p>
<p><strong>closeup - vanessa’s phone</strong>: Fait’s voice drops out as
the battery dies.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: … Daddy?! Daddy?!…</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: … Vanessa?… Vanessa!… Shit!</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: … He’s doing it here. Tonight.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: Selling the stones… A dye laser emits green
light. He needs it to activate them.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: What the hell you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>daria</strong>: What are these stones?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Doomsday in disguise.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: They’re some kinda new synthetic plutonium.
Small and portable, but mega-powerful.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: This fucker’s making bombs?</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: Not making them.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Yeah, he’d need a big operation for that.
Why bother? Just demonstrate the stones work and sell ‘em to whichever
international scumbag offers the highest bid. He makes millions, they
make the bombs, then… ’look out, world.’</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: … Okay, so we know what he’s up to. How’s it
get us to Vanessa?</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: The buyers will want to arrive and leave
quickly… Somewhere private… Accessible by aircraft.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Vanessa said she’s inside a big building.
Could be a hangar.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Man, there’s dozens of little airports around
here. We’d never get to ’em all.</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: … Flight plans.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Hey, yeah. Flight plans show destinations.
All aircraft file ’em with the Aviation Administration. If we could get
a list, we could maybe figure out where the sale’s going down.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: … Daria, call the aviation people. Use our
L.A.P.D. credentials. We need flight plan info for all private aircraft
in this area tonight… Everyone else get ready to move… Miles, the no-gun
policy’s revoked. You break out the heat… Tommy, you gotta get us a
diversion.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: I can help with that.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: … Do it all fast.</p>
<p><strong>int. hangar - night</strong>: Ling, Sona, Charles, and
Russell. Russell finishes testing his contraption. Switches it OFF.
Then, removing his goggles –</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: We’re operational.</p>
<p><strong>sona</strong>: The buyers arrive in less then an hour.</p>
<p><strong>ling</strong>: … So small. So deadly… We’re selling
conscience for money…</p>
<p><strong>ling</strong>: … But it’s a lot of money…</p>

betrayed us. He took them.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Ling? He was one of you?</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: We were partners. Six of us. He killed the
others. He thought he killed me, too.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: So what’re you really after – the stones or
the payback?</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: … Yeah… Let’s get it all.</p>
<p><strong>ling</strong>: You’re the world’s foremost arms dealers. You
all know that weaponry equals power. And in the world of weaponry, nukes
rule.</p>
<p><strong>ling</strong>: But nuclear material is hard to obtain and
difficult to handle… But what if it weren’t?… That’s the question that
brought you here tonight… And here’s the answer.</p>
<p><strong>ling</strong>: In its present state, it’s completely inert.
Zero radiation, zero volatility…</p>

silenced sniper rifle.</p>

advancing tank.</p>
<p><strong>back to vanessa</strong>: She looks back into the camper.
Finds a heavy iron skillet amid the stove utensils. Swings it. And…
SMASH! She SHATTERS a side WINDOW.</p>
<p><strong>miles’ sniper-scope pov</strong>: We FIND Vanessa, jumping
out of the camper.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Vanessa’s out of the camper. Running this
way.</p>
<p><strong>int. hangar - fait and daria</strong>: To Daria –</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Stay.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: reaches a button for opening and closing
the giant hangar doors. She jabs a button, and the nearest door begins
to motor open.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: hears the OPENING HANGAR DOOR. Turns. Sees
Vanessa and goes after her.</p>
<p><strong>sniper-scope pov</strong>: Vanessa rolls out under the rising
door and runs.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: She’s out.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: There’s a guy after her.</p>
<p><strong>int. hangar - charles</strong>: A BULLET rips through the
collar of his leather coat. Just behind his neck. Just missing him. But
he keeps coming.</p>
<p><strong>sniper-scope pov</strong>: Charles rolling out under the
door.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: SHOOTS again. PHUT!</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: The BULLET RICOCHETS off the PAVEMENT right
next to him. In a flash, he’s up and running. Heading out into the
darkness of the airfield after Vanessa. Meanwhile, back inside…</p>
<p><strong>int. hangar</strong>: In here, the hangar door continues to
open as the tank makes its slow approach. Archie’s not a great driver.
Tommy sweeps the muzzle of the machine gun across the group.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Just be cool!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I said don’t move, motherfucker!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Fucking amateurs!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Shit! What do we do?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Shoot back!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Twin .50’s some major firepower. How’d that
little shit get one?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Motherfucker. Couldn’t fucking listen.</p>
<p><strong>across hangar</strong>: Ling and Sona are moving toward the
limo. Ling has the stones. When… Su is there. Blocking the way. Sona
attacks. Su easily blocks the counters. Knocking Sona back. Never taking
his eyes off Ling. When… Sona, who’s fallen back against a buyer’s
bodyguard, quickly takes the bodyguard’s small, full-auto SCORPION and
turns the gun on Su. Su dives for cover as the BURST SHREDS the AREA
where he’d just been standing. As Sona continues hunting Su… Su sees</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: Don’t let him get away!</p>
<p><strong>tommy and archie</strong>: Having just waxed Russell, see
Ling in the limo. Tommy’s .50 is out of ammo. He switches to the .30
cal. tank’s machine gun. As Archie steers toward the limo, Tommy begins
BLASTING away.</p>
<p><strong>limo</strong>: Ling’s trying to drive out, when the .30 CAL.
SLUGS PUNCH HOLES in the LIMO. The tank keeps coming. Ling bails out as
the TANK CRUSHES the LIMO. INTERCUT WITH which…</p>
<p><strong>su and sona</strong>: Play cat and mouse. Su rapidly runs out
of room to hide. He can’t get away. Su stands. Faces her. Faces the
inevitable. When… WHAM! Daria appears from nowhere. Kicks the gun from
Sona’s hand. To Su, re: Ling, now running from the crushed limo</p>
<p><strong>daria</strong>: Get him.</p>
<p><strong>sniper-scope pov - night vision</strong>: Charles and Vanessa
become clearly visible. Charles is closing in on her. Cross-hairs FIND
him. PHUT!</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: The BULLET knocks his gun from his hands.
Charles is slowed but keeps going.</p>
<p><strong>sniper-scope pov - night vision</strong>: Charles reaches the
flight line. Parked planes, a gas truck, a shed, etc. He disappears
behind the equipment.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: sweeps the rifle, looking for Charles and
Vanessa. He comms Fait.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Lost ’em behind the gas truck.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: stops behind the gas truck. Looks around
for Vanessa. No sign of her. Until… Charles notices the door to the gas
truck isn’t closed all the way. He whips it open. And… There’s Vanessa,
hiding inside. Charles grabs her. Yanks her out struggling and
kicking.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Time to end this my way.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Drop the girl.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Put her down.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Daddy!</p>
<p><strong>sniper-scope pov - night vision</strong>: Fait, Charles and
Vanessa. No clear shot.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: comms Fait.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: No shot.</p>
<p><strong>fait, charles and vanessa</strong>: The fight continues.
Fait’s suffering under Charles’ brutal attack. When… Vanessa causes Fait
to stumble near a plane. They fall. Charles moves in. And… Fait’s hand
goes to a set of chocks set against the plane’s wheel. The chocks are
two heavy wooden blocks connected by a length of nylon rope. Fait turns
to Vanessa.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Don’t move.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Wrong kid. Wrong dad.</p>
<p><strong>ext. hangar</strong>: Ling, having just escaped being crushed
in the limo, runs out just as… Four helicopters take off, one after the
other, carrying the buyers away. The fifth chopper, an AGUSTA A109, is
POWERED UP, waiting for the wheelchair-bound French Buyer, being helped
by a bodyguard. Ling intercepts them. Knocks out the bodyguard and tips
over the Frenchman’s chair. Then jumps into the Agusta.</p>
<p><strong>int. agusta - cockpit</strong>: Ling puts a gun to the
pilot’s head.</p>
<p><strong>ling</strong>: Go!</p>
<p><strong>ext. hangar</strong>: Su, having left Daria to fight Sona
inside, runs out.</p>
<p><strong>ext. airfield</strong>: The Agusta begins to lift off. Su
starts running toward the helicopter. Runs under the rising aircraft.
Jumps. Just in time to… Grab onto one of the retractable rear
wheels.</p>
<p><strong>ext. agusta</strong>: As the chopper transfers to forward
motion, Su struggles to get a foot hooked on something, anything. In the
process, he kicks against the helo’s sleek underbelly.</p>
<p><strong>int. agusta</strong>: Ling hears the THUMPS. Looks out.</p>
<p><strong>ling’s pov - su’s leg</strong>: swinging beneath the
Agusta.</p>
<p><strong>ling</strong>: To the pilot –</p>
<p><strong>ling</strong>: Retract the gear!</p>
<p><strong>closeup - control panel</strong>: The pilot hits the
wheels-up switch. And…</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: The gear begins to retract. Disappearing into
the bottom of the chopper. In a second, there’ll be nothing left to
hold.</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: Shoot it down! Now!</p>
<p><strong>int. tank</strong>: Archie aims the cannon.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Can you hit it?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: No problem. Absolutely… Load.</p>
<p><strong>sky</strong>: The Agusta’s tail is BLOWN AWAY by the CANNON
SHELL.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Shot him right in the ass.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: I did it. I can’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Thought you said it was no problem.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: What do I know?</p>
<p><strong>int. agusta - cockpit</strong>: The pilot hopelessly fights
to keep the chopper from crashing.</p>
<p><strong>ext. airfield</strong>: The out-of-control AGUSTA swings back
toward Su and the hangar, losing altitude. Then SMASHES into the tarmac,
ripping open the fuel tank, spilling fuel behind it as it caroms off the
hangar and inscribes a large, skidding circle around Su before CRASHING
into another CHOPPER and BURSTING</p>
<p><strong>into flames.</strong>: The spilled fuel ignites. A circle of
intense fire. With Su in the middle. The Agusta pilot, still alive, has
been thrown outside the circle. But Ling’s only path of escape takes him
inside. Into the circle. He emerges with the bag of stones. Su is
waiting.</p>
<p><strong>ling</strong>: I’ll kill you fast. You won’t Feel a
thing.</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: … I won’t. You will</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: This is for our friends.</p>
<p><strong>inside ling’s throat</strong>: The CERAMIC CAPSULE SHATTERS.
Releasing the hot, glowing white sliver of stone into Ling’s windpipe.
The fragment’s super high-energy radiation instantly beginning to cook
Ling’s body from within. The power of a few thousand microwave ovens
turned on all at once. Ling’s bodily fluids instantly start boiling dry
as…</p>
<p><strong>same scene - moments later</strong>: Su and Fait meet on the
tarmac. Su has the stones. Fait’s holding Vanessa, asleep in his arms.
SIRENS APPROACH in b.g. The two men regard each other a moment.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: We got it all. What happens to the stones?</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: They’ll be destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Looks like I’ll be doing some jail time.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Jail? Man, you just helped save the planet.
Law’s gotta allow for that.</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: I’ll do what I can.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: That’s good, ’cause I mean, we make a
helluva team, y’know? Well, not you, ’cause you’re law enforcement. But
the rest of us – look, a white guy comes in handy now and then. Y’know,
if you’re pulling a job in Beverly Hills or ripping off a country club
or whatever… What kind of percentage are we talking?</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: We’re not.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Time I got real.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: Time we all did.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Get real? What’s that mean?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: … Means we’re through with that life.</p>
<p><strong>daria</strong>: I’m with you, T.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Whatever you say, man.</p>
<p><strong>su</strong>: … Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>fait</strong>: … Faith.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: What, you’re all gonna go straight, just
like that?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Maybe oughta try it yourself.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Me? Are you kidding? I’ve had straight jobs.
You ever had a</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I had plenty of straight jobs.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Name one.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I sold Avon door-to-door.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: … You were an Avon lady?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I was an Avon man. You got a problem with
that?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: No, it’s just, well, uh…</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Nah, I’m just fucking with you. But my momma
did it, and don’t you dare start disrespecting my momma…</p>
