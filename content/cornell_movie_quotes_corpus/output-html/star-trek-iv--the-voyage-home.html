<p><strong>female voice</strong>: What do you make of it?</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: It appears to be a probe, Captain. From
an intelligence unknown to us.</p>
<p><strong>female voice</strong>: Continue transmitting; Universal Peace
and Hello in all known languages. Get me Starfleet Command.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Starfleet Command, this is USS Saratoga
patrolling Sector 5, neutral zone. We are tracking a probe of unknown
origin on apparent trajectory to the Terran solar system. Attempts to
communicate with the probe have been negative on all known
frequencies.</p>
<p><strong>starfleet voice</strong>: Continue tracking, Saratoga. We
will analyze transmissions and advise.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Roger, Starfleet, Saratoga out.</p>
<p><strong>helmsman</strong>: Range 400,000 kilometers, closing. Here it
comes again.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: What’s causing that!?</p>
<p><strong>science officer</strong>: Captain, their call is being
carried on an amplification wave of enormous power!</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Can you isolate the wave?</p>
<p><strong>science officer</strong>: Negative. It’s impacting on all our
systems!</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Yellow alert! Shields up. Helm, reduce
closing speed!</p>
<p><strong>helmsman</strong>: Captain, Thruster controls have been
neutralized!</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Emergency Thrusters!</p>
<p><strong>helmsman</strong>: No response, Captain!</p>
<p><strong>captain’s voice</strong>: Emergency lights!</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Damage report!</p>
<p><strong>science officer</strong>: Captain… All systems have failed…
We are functioning on reserve power only.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: We’re out of control – Rig for
collision…</p>
<p><strong>science officer</strong>: They’ve finished us. And we don’t
even know what they want…</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Give me whatever you’ve got on the
emergency channel. Starfleet Command, this is Saratoga. Can you hear
me…? Come in, please… Come in, please…</p>
<p><strong>9 int. corridor - federation headquarters - close on
9</strong>: FEET</p>
<p><strong>chapel</strong>: Thank you for coming. It’s not going
well.</p>
<p><strong>sarek</strong>: Am I to late to testify?</p>
<p><strong>chapel</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>klingon voice</strong>: There! Hold the image,
<u>hold</u>!</p>
<p><strong>klingon ambassador</strong>: Behold! The quintessential devil
in these matters! James T. Kirk, renegade and terrorist! Not only is he
responsible for the murder of a Klingon crew; the theft of a Klingon
vessel. See now the real plot and intentions:</p>
<p><strong>klingon ambassador</strong>: Even as the Federation
negotiated a peace treaty with us, Kirk was secretly developing the
Genesis torpedo! Conceived by Kirk’s son and test detonated by the
Admiral himself! The result of this awesome energy was euphemistically
called “The Genesis Planet…” A secret base from which to launch the.
annihilation of the Klingon people! We demand the extradition of Kirk!
We demand justice!</p>
<p><strong>sarek</strong>: Klingon justice is a unique point of view,
Mr. President.</p>
<p><strong>sarek</strong>: Genesis was perfectly named: The creation of
life not death. It was the Klingons who had first blood while trying to
possess its secrets.</p>
<p><strong>klingon ambassador</strong>: Vulcans are well known as the
intellectual puppets of the Federation!</p>
<p><strong>sarek</strong>: Your vessel did destroy U.S.S. Grissom. Your
men did kill Kirk’s son. Do you deny these events?</p>
<p><strong>klingon ambassador</strong>: We deny nothing! We have the
right to preserve our race!</p>
<p><strong>sarek</strong>: Do you have the right to murder?</p>
<p><strong>council president</strong>: Order. There will be no further
outbursts from the floor.</p>
<p><strong>sarek</strong>: Mr. President, I have come to speak on behalf
of the accused.</p>
<p><strong>klingon ambassador</strong>: Personal bias! His son was saved
by Kirk!</p>
<p><strong>council president</strong>: Mr. Ambassador, with all respect,
the Council’s deliberations are over. You have been allowed to speak in
order to put your views on the record.</p>
<p><strong>klingon ambassador</strong>: Then Kirk goes unpunished?!?</p>
<p><strong>council president</strong>: Admiral Kirk has been charged
with nine violations of Starfleet regulations…</p>
<p><strong>klingon ambassador</strong>: Starfleet regulations?
Outrageous! Remember this well: there will be no peace as long as Kirk
lives!</p>
<p><strong>council president</strong>: Sarek of Vulcan, with all respect
– we ask you to return Kirk and his crew to answer for their crimes.</p>
<p><strong>sarek</strong>: With respect to you, Mr. President, there is
only <u>one</u> crime: denying Kirk and his crew the honors they so
richly deserve.</p>
<p><strong>council president</strong>: … You are welcome to remain and
testify.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Captain’s Log, Stardate 8390…</p>
<p><strong>kirk’s voice</strong>: We are in the third month of our
Vulcan exile. We are uncertain about the progress of Captain Spock’s
memory training.. And it was Doctor McCoy with a fine sense of
historical irony, who decided on a name for our captured Klingon
vessel.</p>
<p><strong>kirk’s voice</strong>: … And like those mutineers of 500
years ago, we too have a hard choice to make. A choice made harder
because we are all too old to suffer fools gladly… Nevertheless:</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Let the record show that the Commander and the
crew of the late Starship Enterprise have voted unanimously to return to
Earth to face the consequences of their actions in the rescue of their
comrade, Captain Spock. Thank you all… Repair stations, please.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Mr. Scott, how soon can we get underway?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Give me one more day, sir. The damage
control is easy. Reading Klingon is hard.</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: You’d think they could at least send a ship.
Bad enough to be court marshaled and spend the rest of our lives mining
borite – but to come home in this Klingon flea trap…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: We could learn a thing or two from this flea
trap. It has a cloaking device that cost us a lot.</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: I just wish we could cloak the stench.</p>
<p><strong>saavik</strong>: Admiral, I’d like to continue my work on the
ship until you leave.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Thank you, Lt. Saavik.</p>
<p><strong>saavik</strong>: And… Here is a deposition I have made. If it
is not sufficient, I will return to Earth to testify.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Don’t concern yourself, Saavik. Your leave has
been granted for good and proper cause. How are you feeling?</p>
<p><strong>saavik</strong>: I am well, Admiral.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: You will be in good hands here.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Resume.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I do not understand.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I do not understand the final question…</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: You are half human. The Computer knows
that.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: The question is irrelevant.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: Spock… The retraining of your mind has been
in the Vulcan way, so you may not understand feelings. But as my son,
you have them. They will surface.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: As you wish, since you deem them of value.
But I cannot wait here to find them.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: Where must you go?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: To Earth. To offer testimony.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: You do this – for friendship?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I do this because I was there,</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: Spock. Does the good of the many outweigh
the good of the one…?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I would accept that as an axiom.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: Then you stand here alive because of a
mistake – made by your flawed, feeling, human friends. They have
sacrificed their futures because they believed that the good of the
<u>one</u> – you – was more important to them.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Humans make illogical decisions…</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: … They do, indeed.</p>
<p><strong>council president</strong>: Status report, Admiral!</p>
<p><strong>morrow</strong>: Mr. President, the Probe has passed through
all quadrants. The starships Shepard and Yorktown and three smaller
vessels have been neutralized.</p>
<p><strong>council president</strong>: “Neutralized?” How?</p>
<p><strong>morrow</strong>: We don’t know. It’s using forms of energy
our best scientists do not understand…</p>
<p><strong>council president</strong>: Can you protect us?</p>
<p><strong>morrow</strong>: We are launching everything we have.</p>
<p><strong>controller one</strong>: Excelsior and Intrepid are cleared
to depart. Open space dock doors.</p>
<p><strong>controller two</strong>: Sir! Space dock doors are
inoperative!</p>
<p><strong>controller one</strong>: Keep trying. Excelsior and Intrepid
stand by! Malfunction on exit doors.</p>
<p><strong>intrepid voice</strong>: Control, Intrepid. Never mind. We
can’t get powered up!</p>
<p><strong>controller two</strong>: Space doors not responding. All
Emergency systems are non- functional.</p>
<p><strong>controller one</strong>: Engage reserve power. Starfleet
Command, this is Space dock on emergency channel. We have lost all
internal power. Repeat, we have lost all power!…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Systems report. Communications?</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Communications Systems ready. Communications
Officer – ready as she’ll ever be.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Mr. Sulu?</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Guidance is functional. Onboard Computer will
interface with Federation memory bank…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Weapons systems?</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Operational, Admiral. Cloaking Device now
available in all modes of flight.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I’m impressed, Mr. Chekov. A lot of effort for
a short voyage.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: We are in an enemy wessel, sir. I didn’t
wish to be shot down on thee way to our own funeral.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Most prudent. Engine room. Report, Scotty.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: We’re ready, sir. I’ve converted the
Dilithium Sequencer to something less primitive. And Admiral – I’ve
replaced the Klingon Food Packs. They was givin’ me sour stomach.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Appreciated by all, Mr. Scott. Prepare for
departure.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Well, Saavik. I guess this is goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>saavik</strong>: Yes, Admiral. Sir. I have not had the
opportunity to tell you about your son. David died most bravely. He
saved Spock. He saved us all… I thought you should know.</p>
<p><strong>saavik</strong>: Good day, Captain Spock… May your journey be
free of incident.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Live long and prosper, Lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Permission to come aboard.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Permission granted.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Thank you, Admiral.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Jim, Spock, Jim. Remember…?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: It would be improper to refer to you as Jim
while you are in command, Admiral… Also, I must apologize for my attire.
I seem to have misplaced my uniform.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Well, I… find that understandable I mean,
you’ve been through a lot. Station, please.</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: You sure this is such a bright idea?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: I mean <u>him</u>, back at his post, like
nothing happened. I don’t know if you’d got the whole picture but he
isn’t exactly working on all thrusters.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: It’ll come back to him.</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: Are you sure? That’s what I thought.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Mr. Sulu… Take us home…</p>
<p><strong>42 int. starfleet command - screen and graphics -
42</strong>: PULL BACK</p>
<p><strong>audio #1</strong>: Juneau, Alaska, cloud cover increased to
95 percent!</p>
<p><strong>audio #2</strong>: Tokyo, total cloud cover. All power is
from reserve banks.</p>
<p><strong>audio #3</strong>: Leningrad has lost electrical power. Cloud
cover 100 percent. Temperatures dropping rapidly.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: What is estimate cloud cover of the
Planet at this time?</p>
<p><strong>computer voice</strong>: 93.2 percent. Probe now orbiting
South Pacific. Estimate total cloud cover by next orbit. No known way to
dissipate cloud cover.</p>
<p><strong>morrow</strong>: Notify all stations: Starfleet Emergency,
Red Alert. Switch power immediately to Planetary Reserves.</p>
<p><strong>morrow</strong>: Mr. President, even with Planetary Reserves
we cannot survive without the sun.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: I am well aware of that, Admiral.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Sarek… Is there no answer we can give
this Probe?</p>
<p><strong>sarek</strong>: It is difficult to answer if you do not
understand the question. Mr. President, perhaps you should transmit a
planet distress signal, while we still have time.</p>
<p><strong>43 omitted 43</strong>: &amp; &amp; 44 44</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Estimating Planet Earth one point six hours
present speed.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Continue on course. Chekov, any signs of
Federation escort?</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: No, sir. And no Federation wessels on
assigned patrol stations.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: That’s odd. Uhura, what’s on the Comm
channels…?</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Very active, Sir. Multi-phasic transmissions,
overlapping…. almost a gibberish… Let me see if I can sort it out.</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: Hi… Busy?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Uhura is busy. I am monitoring.</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: Umm. Well, just wanted to say – nice to have
your katra back in your head, not mine. I mean, I may have carried your
soul, but I sure couldn’t fill your shoes.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: … My shoes…</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: Forget it… How ’bout covering a little
philosophical ground? Life, Death, Life… Things of that nature?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I did not have time on Vulcan to review the
Philosophical disciplines.</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: Spock, it’s me, Bones! I mean our experience
was unique. You really have gone where no man has gone before. Can’t you
tell me what it felt like?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: It would be impossible to discuss the subject
without a common frame of reference.</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: You’re joking…!</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: A joke is a story with a humorous climax.</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: You mean I have to die to discuss your
insights on death?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Pardon me, Doctor, I am hearing many calls of
distress.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Overlapping distress calls. Some from
Starships… others…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: On screen!</p>
<p><strong>president’s image</strong>: This is… President of… Grave
Warning: Do not approach Planet Earth… To all Starships, repeat, do not
approach! … Orbiting Probe… emits transmissions on energy wave unknown
to us… Wave, directed at our oceans… Ionized our atmosphere… All power
sources have failed. Starships are powerless. … A cloud envelope has
enveloped the Planet. Heavy rain and flooding. Temperature dropping to
critical level. Planet cannot survive unless Probe is responded to…
Probe transmissions dominate all standard channels. Communications may
not be possible… Save yourselves. Avoid the Planet Earth… Farewell.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Spock? What do you make of it?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Most unusual. An unknown form of energy of
great intelligence and power. I find it illogical that its intentions
are hostile…</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: Really? You think this is its way of saying
“Hi there” to the people of the Earth?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: There are millions of other species on Earth,
Doctor. Only human arrogance would assume the message was meant for
man.</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: I liked him better before he died.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Bones –</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: Dammit, Jim, they’ve made him into a goddam
green-blooded computer!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Spock – you’re suggesting the transmission is
meant for life form other than man?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: A distinct possibility, Admiral. The
President did say the transmission was directed at the Earth’s
Oceans</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Uhura… Can you modify the Probe’s signals by
accounting for density temperature and salinity factors?</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: I’ll try, sir.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: I think I have it, sir.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Then, this is what it would sound like
underwater?</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Fascinating. If my suspicion is correct,
there can be no response to this message.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Where are you going?!</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: To the on-board computer room. To confirm my
suspicion.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Bones, stay here.</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: No way – somebody has to keep an eye on
him!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Spock…?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: As suspected, the Probe’s transmissions are
the songs sung by whales.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Whales?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Specifically, Humpback Whales.</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: That’s crazy! Who would send a probe hundreds
of light years to talk to a whale?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: It’s possible. Whales were on Earth far
earlier than man…</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: 10 million years earlier. Humpbacks were
heavily hunted by Man. They have been extinct since the 21st Century… It
is possible that an alien intelligence sent the probe to determine why
they lost contact.</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: … My God…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Spock, could the Humpback’s answer to this
call be simulated?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: The sounds, but not the language. We would be
responding in gibberish.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Is there any other planet where this species
exists?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: The Humpback was indigenous to Earth. Earth
of the past.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: That leaves us no choice. We must destroy the
probe before it destroys Earth.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: That would be futile, Admiral. The probe
would neutralize us easily.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: But we can’t turn away! Is there no
alternative?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: There is one, but I cannot guarantee its
success. We could attempt to find some Humpback Whales.</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: You just said there aren’t any except on
Earth of the past.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: That is what I said, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: Then how.?</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: Now wait just a damn minute.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Spock, start your computations for time warp.
Come on, Bones. Let’s pay Scotty a visit.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Scotty, how long is this bay?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: About 60 feet, Admiral.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: That should be enough. Can you enclose it to
hold water?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: I suppose I can, sir; are you planning to
take a swim?</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: Off the deep end, Mr. Scott.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Scotty, we have to find some Humpbacks.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Humpbacked - people.?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Whales, Scotty. 45 to 50 feet long; about 40
tons a piece.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Admiral - how am I going to handle all that
weight?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: You’ll work it out, Scotty. And remember: two
of them.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Two?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: It takes two to tango, Mr. Scott.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: The great flood and Noah’s Ark. what a way
to finally go.</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: You’re really going to try this time travel
in this rust bucket?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: We’ve done it before.</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: Sure, slingshot around the Sun. If you pick
up enough speed you’re in time warp. If you don’t, you fry..</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Would you prefer to do nothing?</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: I prefer a dose of common sense. you are
proposing to head backwards in time, find Humpback Whales, then bring
them forward in time, drop them off - and hope they tell this Probe what
to do with itself!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: – That’s the general idea.</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: That’s crazy!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: If you have a better idea - now’s the
time.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Mr. Spock, your computations?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: In progress, Admiral.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Uhura. Get me through to Starfleet
Command.</p>
<p><strong>comm officer</strong>: Sir… I’m picking up a faint
transmission… It’s Admiral Kirk calling…!</p>
<p><strong>morrow</strong>: On screen!</p>
<p><strong>morrow</strong>: Satellite reserve power, now!</p>
<p><strong>kirk’s image</strong>: … Analysis… Probe call… Captain Spock…
Opinion… extinct species, Humpback Whale… proper response… Do you read
me…?</p>
<p><strong>morrow</strong>: Stabilize! Emergency reserve!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Starfleet, if you read, we are going to
attempt time travel. We are computing our trajectory at this time…</p>
<p><strong>sarek</strong>: Good luck, Kirk. And all you go with you.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Ready to engage computer, Admiral.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: What is our target in time?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: The late 20th Century.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Surely you can be more specific…</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Not with this equipment. I have had to
program some of the variables from memory.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: What are the variables…?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Availability of fuel components; Mass of the
vessel through a time continuum, and the probable location of Humpbacks,
in this case, the Pacific basin.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: You’ve programmed that from memory…?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I have.</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: Angels and ministers of grace, defend us.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Hamlet, Act I scene 4.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Mr. Spock… None of us has doubts about your
memory. Engage computer. Prepare for Warp Speed.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Shields, Mr. Chekov.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Shields, aye.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: May fortune favor the foolish. Mr. Sulu, Warp
Speed!</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Warp two… three…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Steady as she goes…</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Warp five… seven…</p>
<p><strong>scotty’s voice</strong>: I don’t think she’ll hold together,
sir!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: No choice now, Scotty!</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Sir, heat shields at maximum!</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Warp Nine… Nine point two… Nine point
three…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Mr. Sulu, we need breakaway speed!</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Hang on, sir… Nine point seven… point eight…
Breakaway threshold…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Steady!!… Now, Mr. Sulu!</p>
<p><strong>61 omitted 61</strong>: &amp; &amp; 62 62</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Mr. Sulu…? … Mr. Sulu?!</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: … Aye sir…?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: What is our condition?</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Sir… Braking thrusters seem to have fired.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Picture, please.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Earth… But when?… Spock?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Judging by the pollution content of the
atmosphere, I believe we have arrived at the late 20th Century.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Well done, Mr. Spock.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Admiral, I am receiving whale songs.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: On speakers.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Home in on the strongest signal. Descend from
orbit.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Admiral, if I may: we’re probably already
visible to the tracking devices of the time.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Quite right, Spock. Mr. Chekov, engage
cloaking device!</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: We are crossing the terminator into night.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Homing in on the west coast of North
America…</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Individual whale song getting stronger… This
is strange, Admiral. The song is directly ahead. It’s coming from San
Francisco.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: From a city? That doesn’t make sense….</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Perhaps thy are stranded in the Bay, sir?… Or
in captivity?</p>
<p><strong>scotty’s voice</strong>: Admiral, you and Spock better get
down here…!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Continue approach…</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: They’re giving out. De-crystallizing.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Give me a round figure, Mr. Scott.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Oh, twenty-four hours, give or take, staying
cloaked. After that, Admiral, we’ll be visible – and dead in the water.
In any case, we won’t have enough to break out of the Earth’s gravity,
to say nothing of getting back home.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I can’t believe we’ve come this far only to be
stopped by this! Scotty, is there any way dilithium can be
re-crystallized?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Sorry, sir. We can’t even do that in the
23rd Century.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: There is a 20th Century possibility.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Explain.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: If memory serves, there was a dubious
flirtation with nuclear fission reactors resulting in toxic side
effects. By the beginning of the fusion era, these reactors had been
replaced, but at this time, we should be able to find some.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: But you said toxic.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: We could rig a device to collect their high
energy photons safely; we could then inject the photons into the
dilithium chamber, causing crystalline restructure…. Theoretically.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Where would we find these reactors…
Theoretically.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Nuclear power was widely used in naval
vessels…</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: It doesn’t look all that different.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Let’s hope so, Bones. Mr. Sulu, set us down in
Golden Gate Park.</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Aye, sir. Descending.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: We’ll divide into teams. Commanders Chekov and
Uhura are assigned to the Uranium problem.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Dr. McCoy, you, Mr. Scott and Commander Sulu
will convert us a whale tank.</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: Oh, joy.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Captain Spock and I will attempt to trace
these whale songs to their source.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: I’ll have bearing and distance for you,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Right. Now look: I want you all to be very
careful. This is terra incognita. Many customs will doubtless take us by
surprise. It’s a forgone conclusion these people have never seen an
extra-terrestrial before.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: This is an extremely primitive and paranoid
culture. Mr. Chekov, issue a phaser and communicator to each team. We’ll
maintain radio silence except in emergency, all transmissions to be
preceded by three coded bleeps. Anyone in uniform, get rid of your rank
insignia. Any questions? All right, let’s do our job and get out of
here. Our own world is waiting for us to save it if we can.</p>
<p><strong>1st garbage man</strong>: So I told her: if you think I’m
laying out sixty bucks for a goddam toaster oven you got another thing
coming.</p>
<p><strong>2nd garbage man</strong>: So what’d she say?</p>
<p><strong>1st garbage man</strong>: What the fuck was that?</p>
<p><strong>number two</strong>: Did you see that?</p>
<p><strong>number one</strong>: No. And neither did you, so shut up.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: We’ll stick together till we get orientated.
Bearing to the whales?</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: 283 degrees… 15.2 kilometers…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Everyone remember where we parked.</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: It’s a miracle these people ever got out of
the 23rd century.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Damn, they’re still using money. We’re going
to need some.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: You people wait here… And spread out. We look
like a cadet review. … Spock –</p>
<p><strong>car driver</strong>: Watch were you’re going, you dumb
ass!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: And double dumb ass on you!</p>
<p><strong>the boy</strong>: Ojichan? Akira ojichaan dewa naino? Koko de
nani shiteru no?</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Gomen nasarei. Hito chigai de gozaranuka na.
I’m sorry, my son. You have mis- taken me for someone else.</p>
<p><strong>the boy</strong>: Ah, chigaau hito da. Hanashi kata ga
okashii. Yes, this must be true. You talk funny.</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Chotto omachi nasarei. Namae wa nanto
moosareruka na. Wait my son. What is your name?</p>
<p><strong>the boy</strong>: Sulu Hikaru.</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Ah, sorenara mazu mazu nagaiki wo sareru to
mira. Ah… Then I am sure that you will have a long and happy life.</p>
<p><strong>the boy</strong>: Arigato. Sayonara. Thank you, honorable
sir.</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: Who was that?</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: That, Doctor, was my great great
grandfather.</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: Yes, they’re eighteenth Century American,
quite valuable. Are you sure you want to part with them?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: How much will you give me?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Weren’t those a birthday present from
Dr. McCoy?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: And they will be again, Spock. That’s the
beauty of it. How much?</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: They’d be worth more if the lenses were
intact. I’ll give you 200 bucks take it or leave it.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Is that a lot?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: That’s all there is, so nobody splurge. Are we
set? Then, good hunting.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Well, Spock, thanks to your restored memory
and a little bit of luck, we are in the streets of San Francisco looking
for a pair of humpback whales. How do you propose to solve this minor
problem?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Simple logic will suffice. We need a map.
That one should do.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I will juxtapose our coordinates on this map
and find our destination.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I think we’ll find what we’re looking for at
the Cetacean Institute in Sausalito. Two Humpbacks called George and
Gracie.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: How do you know this…?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: … Simple logic.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: What does it mean, exact change?</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: Would you mind telling me how we plan to
convert this tank?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Ordinarily, I could do it with a piece of
transparent aluminum…</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: You’re about 150 years too early for that.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: I know. We’ve got to find the 20th Century
equivalent…</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: What about that?</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Find it?</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Yes, under “U.S. Government.” Now we need
directions.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Excuse me, sir. Can you direct me to the
Navy base in Alameda?</p>
<p><strong>passerby</strong>: The… Navy base?</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Yes. Where they keep the nuclear
wessels.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Excuse me. Can you please stop that sound?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: As you observed, a primitive Culture.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Admiral, may I ask you a question?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Spock, don’t call me Admiral. Don’t you
remember: you used to call me Jim… Now what’s your question?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Your use of language has altered since our
arrival. It is currently laced with – shall I say – more colorful
metaphors: “Double dumb ass on you” – and so forth…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: You mean profanity. That’s simply the way they
talk here. Nobody pays any attention to you if you don’t swear every
other word. You’ll find it in all the literature of the period.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: For example?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Oh, the complete works of Jacqueline Susan,
the novels of Harold Robbins….</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Ah… The giants.</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: Good morning. I’m your guide this morning;
my name’s Dr. Gillian Taylor, but you can call me Gillian. I’m Assistant
Director of the Maritime Cetacean Institute. Please follow me and just
give a yell if you can’t hear, okay?</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: The Cetacean Institute is the only museum
in the world exclusively devoted to whales. As you can see we have a
great seal to offer, but that is small compared to what we know – or
rather what wee don’t know about whales. The first commonly held
misconception is that whales are fish. They’re not; they’re mammals like
us. Warm-blooded, needing air to breathe and producing milk to nurse
their young. They are very old mammals – 11 million years, give or
take.</p>
<p><strong>a man</strong>: Do whales attack people – like in “Moby
Dick”?</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: Most whales don’t even have teeth. They
strain vast amounts of tiny shrimp for food and that is the limit of
their hostility. Un- fortunately, their principle enemy is far more
aggressive.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: You mean man…</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: To put it mildly. Since the dawn of time,
men have harvested whales for a variety of purposes, most of which can
be achieved synthetically at this point. A hundred years ago, using
hand-thrown harpoons, they did plenty of damage – but that was nothing
compared to what they’ve achieved in this century.</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: This is mankind’s legacy: whales hunted to
the brink of extinction. Virtually gone is the Blue Whale, largest
creature ever to inhabit the Earth. Despite all attempts at banning
whaling, there are still countries and pirates currently engaged in
slaughter of these inoffensive creatures. Where the humpback whale once
numbered in the hundreds of thousands, today there are less than 7
thousand specimens alive and those that are taken are no longer fully
grown. In addition, many of the females are killed, still bearing unborn
calves.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: To hunt a species to extinction is not
logical.</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: Whoever said the human race was logical?
Now if you’ll follow me, I’ll introduce you to the Institute’s pride and
joy.</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: This is the largest sea water tank in the
world – and it contains the only two humpback whales in captivity.</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: They are mature humpbacks, weighing 45,000
pounds each. They wandered into San Francisco Bay as calves and were
brought here. We call them George and Gracie.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: It’s perfect, Spock: a male, a female,
together in a contained space can beam them up together and consider
ourselves damn lucky…</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: Beautiful, aren’t they? And extremely
intelligent. Why shouldn’t they be? They’re swimming around with the
largest brains on Earth… Now if you’ll follow me please.</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: Despite all the things they are teaching us
we have to return George and Gracie to the open sea.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Why’s that?</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: Well, for one thing, we simply don’t have
the money to keep feeding them a couple of tons of shrimp a day!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: How soon?</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: Soon… It’s too bad because they’re very
friendly as you can see. I’ve grown quite attached to them… This
way.</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: Here’s a much better way to see George and
Gracie – underwater.</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: What you’re hearing is whale song. It is
sung by the male. He’ll sing any- where from six to as long as thirty
minutes, and then, start again. In the ocean, other whales will pick up
the song… And pass it on.</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: The songs change every year, but we still
don’t know what purpose they serve. Are they navigational? Part of the
mating ritual? Or pure communication beyond our comprehension?</p>
<p><strong>an older woman</strong>: Maybe he’s singing to the man.</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: What the hell –! Excuse me! Wait right
here!</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: Who the hell are you? What were you doing
in there?!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: You heard the lady!</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Attempting the hell to communicate.</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: Communicate? Communicate what? You have no
right to be here!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Come on, fellah – speak up!</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Admiral, if we were to assume these. whales
are ours to do with as we please, we would be as guilty as those who
caused their extinction.</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: Ohhh<u>kay</u>. I don’t know what this is
about, but I want you guys outta here right now or I call the cops.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I assure you that won’t be necessary. We were
only trying to help…</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: The hell you were, buster. Your friend was
messing up my tank and messing up my whales…</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: They like you very much. But they are not the
hell your whales.</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: I suppose they told you that…?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: The hell they did.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Spock…</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: About those colorful metaphors we discussed. I
don’t think you should try to use them.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Well, for one thing, you haven’t quite got the
hang of it.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: And another thing… It is not always necessary
to tell the truth.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I cannot tell a lie.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: You don’t have to lie… You could
exaggerate.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Exaggerate.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: You’ve done it before. Can’t you remember?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: The hell I can’t</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: What else did you learn from your mind
meld?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: They are very unhappy about the way their
species has been treated by man.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: They have a right to be… Do you think they’ll
help us?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I believe I was successful in communicating
our intentions.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: … I see.</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: It’s all right. Yes. I know. It’s okay.
They didn’t mean any harm.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Heard there was some excitement.</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: Just a couple of kooks…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: How’re you doing?</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: Fine. Just fine.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Don’t tell me fish stories, kiddo. I’ve known
you too long.</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: Bob… it’s tearing me apart.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I know. I feel the same thing. But we’re
between a rock and a hard place. We can’t keep them without risking
their lives and we can’t let them go without a taking the same
chance.</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: And finally, they’re not human beings, you
know. Their intelligence has in no way been proven comparable to ours
–</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: I don’t know about you, but my compassion
for someone is not limited to my estimate of their intelligence. I mean
whales may not have painted the Mona Lisa or invented the dirt bike but
they didn’t ravish the land either.</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: Sorry if I spoke out of turn.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Not at all. You gave me things to think about.
You always do. You do sound a little wrecked, why don’t you go home and
stare at the ceiling?</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: Why don’t I?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: We all squared away?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Looks like it.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: She’s gonna go berserk.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: It’s for her own good, Joe; it’s the only way.
She’ll call me names for a while, but then she’ll calm down and
understand.</p>
<p><strong>103 ext. alameda naval base - long shot - day - 103</strong>:
ESTABLISHING</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Team leader, this is team 2. Come in,
please…</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: I have the coordinates of the reactor…</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: … It gives me a great sense of history.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: It gives me a great sense of danger. We have
to beam in next to the reactor room, not in it.</p>
<p><strong>kirk’s voice</strong>: Team 2? Kirk here….</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Admiral, we have found the nuclear
wessel.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Ah, well done, team 2.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: And Admiral, it’s the Enterprise.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Understood. What is your plan?</p>
<p><strong>chekov’s voice</strong>: We will beam in tonight, collect the
photons and beam out. No one will ever know we were there.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Understood and approved. Keep me informed.
Kirk out.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: It’s her – from the Institute. If we play our
cards right, we may learn when those whales are really leaving.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: How will playing cards help?</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: Well, if it isn’t Robin Hood and Friar
Tuck.</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: Where’re you fellahs heading?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Back to San Francisco.</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: Came all the way down here to jump in and
swim with the kiddies, huh?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: There’s really very little point in my trying
to explain.</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: I buy that. What about him?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: He’s harmless. Back in the sixties he was part
of the Free Speech movement at Berkeley. I think he did too much
LDS.</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: LDS?? Are you dyslexic on top of everything
else? Come on, Lemme give you a lift. I have a notorious weakness for
hard luck cases – that’s why I work with whales.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: We don’t want to be any trouble.</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: You’ve already been that. C’mon.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: Don’t mention it. And don’t try anything,
either. I got a tire iron right where I can get at it.</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: So you were at Berkeley.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I was not.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Memory problems, too.</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: Uh huh. What about you? Where you from?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Iowa.</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: A landlubber. Come on, what the hell were
you boys really trying to do back there? Was it some kinda macho thing?
If that’s all, I’m gonna be real disappointed. I hate that macho
type.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Can I ask <u>you</u> something?</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: What’s going to happen when you release the
whales?</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: They’re gonna hafta take their chances.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: What does that mean, exactly? Take their
chances.</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: It means that they will be at risk from
whale hunters – same as the rest of the humpbacks. What did you mean
when you said all that stuff back at the Institute about extinction?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I meant –</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: He meant what you were saying on the tour:
that if things keep on the way they’re going, humpbacks will disappear
forever.</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: That’s not what he said, farm boy.
“Admiral, if we were to assume these whales are ours to do with as we
please, we would be as guilty as those who <u>caused</u> – past tense –
their extinction.” I have a photographic memory. I <u>see</u> words.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Are you sure it isn’t time for a colorful
metaphor?</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: You’re not one of those guys from the
military, are you? Trying to teach whales to retrieve torpedoes, or some
dipshit stuff like that?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: No, ma’am. No dipshit.</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: Well, that’s something. I’da let you off
right here.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Gracie is pregnant.</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: All right. Who are you? and don’t jerk me
around any more. I want to know how you know that.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: We can’t tell you. Please, just – let me
finish. I can tell you that we’re not in the military and that we intend
no harm to the whales.</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: Then –</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: In fact, we may be able to help – in ways
that, frankly, you couldn’t possibly imagine.</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: Or believe, I’ll bet.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Very likely. You’re not exactly catching us at
our best.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: That much is certain.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: You know I’ve got a hunch we’d all be a lot
happier talking over dinner. What do you say?</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: You guys like Italian food?</p>
<p><strong>nichols</strong>: Professor Scott, I’m Dr. Nichols, plant
manager. I’m terribly sorry but there’s been an awful mix-up Would you
believe I was never told about your visit?</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: I tried to clear things up, Professor Scott.
I explained you’d come all the way from Edinburgh on appointment to
study manufacturing methods here at Plexico, but they don’t seem to know
anything about it.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Don’t know anything about it? I find it
difficult to believe that I’ve come millions of miles –</p>
<p><strong>nichols</strong>: Millions?</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: Thousands; the Professor’s understandably
upset –</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Thousands of miles on an invited tour of
inspection, only to be informed that I was never invited in the first
place!</p>
<p><strong>nichols</strong>: Professor Scott, if you’ll –</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: I demand to see the owners! I demand –</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: Professor, just take it easy! Dr. Nichols is
offering to take us around personally.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: He is?</p>
<p><strong>nichols</strong>: With pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Well, that’s different.</p>
<p><strong>nichols</strong>: If you’ll follow me, Professor –</p>

<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Hi. Huey 205, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Right on. You fly?</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Oh, here and there. I flew something similar
in my Academy days.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: All right, then this is old stuff to you.</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Old, yes. But interesting. Do you mind if I
ask a few questions…?</p>
<p><strong>nichols</strong>: Well, so much for the tour of our humble
plant. I must say, Professor your knowledge of engineering is most
impressive.</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: Back home, we call him the miracle
worker.</p>
<p><strong>nichols</strong>: Indeed… May I offer you gentlemen
anything?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Doctor Nichols, I might have something to
offer <u>you</u>.</p>
<p><strong>nichols</strong>: … Yes?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: I notice you’re still working with
polymers.</p>
<p><strong>nichols</strong>: Sill? What else would I be working
with?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Ah, what else indeed? Let me put it another
way: how thick would a piece of your plexiglass need to be at 60 feet by
10 feet to withstand the pressure of 18,000 cubic feet of water?</p>
<p><strong>nichols</strong>: That’s easy: 6 inches. We carry stuff that
big in stock.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Yes, I noticed. Now suppose – just suppose –
I could show you a way to manufacture a wall that would do the same job
but was only an inch thick. would that be worth something to you,
eh?</p>
<p><strong>nichols</strong>: … Are you joking?</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: He never jokes… Perhaps the professor could
use your computer.</p>
<p><strong>nichols</strong>: Please…</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Computer –</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Hello? Computer…?</p>
<p><strong>nichols</strong>: Just use the keyboard…</p>

out the dynamics of this matrix…!</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: You’ll be rich beyond the dreams of
avarice.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: So, is it worth something? Or should I just
punch “clear”…</p>
<p><strong>nichols</strong>: No! No… What did you have in mind…?</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: A moment alone, please.</p>

be altering the future.</p>

<p><strong>gillian</strong>: … You’re very perceptive.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: How will that be done, exactly?</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: They’ll be flown in a special 747 to Alaska
and released there.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Flown… And that’s the last you’ll see of
them?</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: See, yes. But we’ll tag them with radio
transmitters on a special frequency so we can keep tabs on them.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: You know, I could take those whales somewhere

they’d be safe?</p>

time.</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: Sorry, the time would have to be right
now.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: What do you mean now?</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: Let’s just say that no humpback born in
captivity has ever survived. Problem is, they won’t be a whole lot safer
at sea because of all the hunting this time of year… So that, as they
say, is that. Damn.</p>

<p><strong>gillian</strong>: Well, I was close. I knew outer space was
going to come into it sooner or later.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: All right. The truth?</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: I’m all ears.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: That’s what you think. Okay…Truth… I’m from
what, on your calendar, would be the late 23rd Century. I’ve been sent
back in time to bring two Humpback Whales with me in an attempt to…
repopulate the species.</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: Well, why didn’t you say so? Why all the
coy disguises?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: You want the details?</p>

all the tea in China.</p>

<p><strong>gillian</strong>: Jesus, you are persistent. Okay, your
friend was right. Gracie is not only pregnant, she is very pregnant… At
noon tomorrow – in what is sure to be a media circus – the whales get
shipped out.</p>

<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Well, we don’t. Come on. I don’t have much
time now.</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: Uh… Could we have this to go?</p>

heard.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: You asked. Now, will you tell me something?
George and Gracie’s transmitter. What’s the frequency?</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: Sorry, that’s classified. I don’t really
have a clue who you are… You wouldn’t want to show me around your space
ship, would you?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: It wouldn’t be my first choice, no.</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: So. There we are.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Lemme tell you something. I’m here to bring
two humpbacks into the 23rd Century. If I have to, I’ll go to the open
sea to get them, but I’d just as soon take yours – better for me, better
for you… and better for them.</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: I bet you’re a damn good poker player.</p>

about team two?</p>

their call.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Damn…. Damnit! We’ve been so lucky. We have
the two perfect whales in our hands, but if we don’t move quickly, we’ll
lose them!</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: In that event, the probabilities are that our
mission would fail.</p>

whales. Bearing 328 degrees.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: On screen.</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: What kind of ship is that?</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: A whaling ship, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Estimate range, ship to whales!</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Sir… Estimating one nautical mile.</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: Oh my God, we’re too late!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Mr. Sulu: full power descent!</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Dive speed is 200 knots per minute, 3.3. per
second. Estimate reaching whales in 1.2 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Range to whales, 30 seconds…</p>
<p><strong>201 omitted 201</strong>: thru thru 204 204</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: 10 seconds, sir!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Hover on my mark, Mr. Sulu! Mr. Chekov, stand
by de-cloaking – Scotty, ready for power build up! Mark, Mr. Sulu…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Scotty – Disengage cloaking device!</p>
<p><strong>scotty’s voice</strong>: Aye, sir.</p>
<p><strong>212 omitted 212</strong>: &amp; &amp; 213 213</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Mr. Scott. It’s up to you now. Commence build
up for transporter beam!</p>
<p><strong>scotty’s voice</strong>: Give it me best, sir!</p>
<p><strong>215 omitted 215</strong>: &amp; &amp; 216 216</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Stay with me, sir – I need more power
curve…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: How long, Scotty?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: 10 seconds, Admiral; 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Admiral! There be whales here!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Well done, Mr. Scott. How soon can we be ready
for warp speed?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: I’ll have to re-energize.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Don’t take too long. We’re sitting ducks for
their radar systems… Mr. Sulu, impulse climb.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Unidentified aircraft, 40,000 feet MSL, range
30 miles, bearing 010.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Mr. Scott – how soon?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Stand by, sir. Miracle worker at work…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Mr. Scott, don’t make jokes, we are in danger
of -</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Full power, sir.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Mr. Sulu, if you please.</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Aye, sir, warp speed!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Mr. Sulu, take the con. I’m taking our guest
down to see her whales. Mr. Spock: have you accounted for the variable
mass of whales and water in your time re-entry program?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Mr. Scott cannot give me exact figures,
Admiral. So I will… Make a <u>guess</u>.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: … I don’t think he understands…</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: No, Spock. It means he feels safer about your
“guesses” than most other peoples facts.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: You’re saying… It is a compliment.</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: It is.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I will try to make the best guess I can.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Ironic. When man was killing these creatures,
he was destroying his own future…</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: The beasties seem happy to see you, Doctor.
I hope you like our little aquarium.</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: A miracle, Mr. Scott.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: … The miracle is yet to come.</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: … What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: He means our chances of getting home are not
very good. You might have lived a longer life if you’d stayed where you
belong.</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: I belong here. Suppose by some miracle you
do get them through. Who in the 23rd Century knows anything about
Humpback whales?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: … You have a point…</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: You better get up there, sir. We’re having
some power fall-off…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: On my way…!</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Buckle up, Lassie. It gets bumpy from
here.</p>
<p><strong>scotty’s voice</strong>: Warp seven point five… Seven point
nine… Mr. Sulu, that’s all I can give ye!</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Shields at Maximum!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Can we make breakaway speed!?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Hardly, Admiral, I cannot even guarantee we
will escape the Sun’s gravity! I will attempt to compensate by altering
our trajectory.</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Warp eight. Eight point one… Maximum speed,
sir!</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Admiral, I need thruster control…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Acceleration thrusters at Spock’s
command…!</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Steady… Steady… Now.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Spock… Did braking thrusters fire?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: They did, Admiral.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Then… Where the hell are we?</p>
<p><strong>comm officer</strong>: Sir… I’m picking up a faint
transmission… It’s Admiral Kirk calling…!</p>
<p><strong>morrow</strong>: On screen!</p>
<p><strong>morrow</strong>: Satellite reserve power, now!</p>
<p><strong>kirk’s image</strong>: … Analysis… Probe call… Captain Spock…
Opinion… extinct species, Humpback Whale… proper response… Do you read
me…?</p>
<p><strong>morrow</strong>: Stabilize! Emergency reserve!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Starfleet, if you read, we are going to
attempt time travel. We are computing our trajectory at this time…</p>
<p><strong>sarek</strong>: Good luck, Kirk. And all you go with you.</p>
<p><strong>sarek</strong>: Look!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Spock: Condition report!</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: No data, Admiral. Computers are
non-functional.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: The mains are down, sir! Aux power is not
responding.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Mr. Sulu, switch to manual control!</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: I have no control, sir!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Picture, Uhura!</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: I can’t, sir – Nothing!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Out of control, and blind as a bat!</p>

<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Ground cushion! Keep the nose up if you can
–</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Blow the hatch!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: You got us to the right place, Spock. Now all
we have to do is get the whales out before we <u>sink</u>. Mr. Scott,
come in!… Scotty…?! Damn… Mr. Spock, see to the safety of all hands.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I will, Admiral.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: The whales…?!</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: No power to the bay doors.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: The explosive override – ?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: It’s under water! There’s no way to reach
it…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Go on ahead… Close the hatch!</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Admiral, you’ll be trapped!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Why don’t they answer? Why don’t they sing,
dammit!</p>
<p><strong>morrow</strong>: Mr. President – we have power!</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: By God! Launch rescue shuttle!</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: Congratulations, Jim. I think you’ve saved
the Earth.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Not me, Bones… They did it.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Bring in the accused.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Captain Spock, you do not stand
accused.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I stand with my shipmates. Their fate shall
be mine.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: As you wish. The charges and
specifications are: Conspiracy; Assault on Federation Officers; Theft of
Federation Property; namely the Starship Enterprise; Sabotage of the
U.S.S. Excelsior; willful destruction of Federation Property,
specifically the aforementioned U.S.S. Enterprise; and finally,
disobeying direct orders of the Starfleet Commander… Admiral Kirk, how
do you plead?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: On behalf of all of us, Mr. President, I am
authorized to plead guilty.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: So entered. Hear now the sentence of the
Federation Council: Because of certain mitigating circumstances, all
charges but one are summarily dismissed. The remaining charge,
disobeying orders of a superior officer is directed only at Admiral
Kirk. I’m sure the Admiral will recognize the necessity of keeping
discipline in any chain of command.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I do, sir.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: James T. Kirk. It is the judgment of this
Council that you be reduced in rank to Captain. … And that as a
consequence of your new rank, you be given the duties for which you have
repeatedly demonstrated unswerving ability: the command of a
Starship.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Silence! Captain Kirk, your new command
awaits you. You and your crew have saved this planet from its own
short-sightedness… And we are forever in your debt.</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: My own exonerated Kirk! I’m so.. juiced, I
can’t tell you! Bye, Kirk… Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Hey! – Where you going?!</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: You’re going to your ship, I’m going to
mine. Science Vessel. I’ve got 300 years of catch-up learning to do.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: You mean this is – goodbye?</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: Why does it have to be goodbye?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Well, I… As they say in your century – I don’t
even have your phone number. How will I find you?</p>
<p><strong>gillian</strong>: Don’t worry. I’ll find <u>you</u>. See you
around the galaxy…</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Father…?</p>
<p><strong>sarek</strong>: I will be returning to Vulcan within the
hour… I wanted to take my leave of you.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: It is kind of you to make this effort.</p>
<p><strong>sarek</strong>: It is not an effort. You are my son. Besides;
I am most impressed with your performance in this – crises.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Most kind, Father.</p>
<p><strong>sarek</strong>: As I recall, I opposed your enlistment in
Starfleet… It is possible that judgment was incorrect. Your associates
are people of good character.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: They are my friends.</p>
<p><strong>sarek</strong>: Yes, of course… Do you have any message for
your mother?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Tell her I feel fine…</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: The bureaucratic mentality is the only
constant in the universe. We’ll get a freighter.</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: With all respect, Doctor, I’m counting on
Excelsior.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Excelsior? Why in God’s name would you want
that bucket of bolts?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Scotty, don’t prejudge. A ship is a ship.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Whatever you say, sir. Thy will be done.</p>

<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Aye, sir!</p>
<p><strong>kirk’s voice</strong>: Space, the final frontier. These are
the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Her ongoing mission: to explore
strange new worlds… to seek out new life and new civilizations… To
boldly go where no man has gone before…</p>
<p><strong>version 1</strong>: Starfleet command, this is Captain Joel
Randolph of the starship Yorktown reporting. Emergency channel
Zero-one-three-zero, code red. It has been three hours since our contact
with the alien probe and all attempts at regaining power have failed.
All non-essential crew have been given hiber-sedatives to slow down
consumption of life support reserves. Our chief engineer is attempting
to deploy a makeshift solar sail with which to focus and absorb
radiation from a nearby sun we are orbiting. We have high hopes that
this will, if successful, generate power to keep us alive indefinitely.
If you would patch us through to Engineering Control we could link up
with the technicians there and hopefully lick this problem. We will keep
you posted on our condition. Starfleet, and inform you of any further
developments. Captain Randolph out.</p>
<p><strong>version 2</strong>: Starfleet Command, this is communications
officer Trillya of the U.S.S. Shepard reporting on emergency status code
zero one nine five. Our condition remains the same, the probe has
neutralized all power supplies and we are functioning on reserves only.
All attempts to reinstate main power have failed. Captain Clampett has
quarantined all but minimal support crew due to failure of Bio-
Sterilization capsules containing Vegan D virus, which has already
killed fifteen crew members. All aboard are believed to be infected.
Atmospheric regeneration and reclamation systems are not functional, and
all medical supplies are spoiling due to refrigeration shut down. At
present condition life support systems will be exhausted within eight
hours. Starfleet, please advise…?</p>
<p><strong>council president</strong>: This is the President of the
United Federation of Planets with a Planet Alert, Priority One: Do not
Approach Earth – This is a Priority One warning to all Starships, repeat
do not approach! Earth is under the attack of an unidentified orbiting
probe which emits transmissions on an energy wave unknown to us. This
powerful wave, directed at our oceans, has almost totally ionized our
atmosphere. All power sources have failed or been neutralized. All Earth
orbiting Starships are powerless. A cloud envelope has enshrouded the
planet causing heavy rain and flooding. Temperatures are dropping to
critical levels. This planet cannot survive unless the Probe is
responded to. The Probe’s transmissions dominate all standard channels.
Further communications may not be possible and we have discovered no
methods to repel the Probe or destroy it. Do <u>not</u> attempt
confrontation with the Probe!! Save your energy, save yourselves. Avoid
the Planet Earth at all costs. Farewell…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Starfleet Command, this is Admiral James T.
Kirk in route to Earth in Klingon vessel. We have intercepted and
analyzed the call of the Probe threatening Earth. With the help of
Captain Spock it is our opinion that only the extinct species Humpback
Whale can give the proper response to the Probe. Do you concur with this
opinion?… Do you read me? Starfleet Command, do you read me?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Starfleet Command, we hope you can hear us. If
you read, Starfleet, we are going to attempt time travel. We are
computing our trajectory at this time.</p>
