<p><strong>guard</strong>: Open the gate!</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: You were attacked in the forest?</p>
<p><strong>turold</strong>: Yes. We lost five.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: You were lucky. I lost thirty there.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: I tried to reach Ynyr, the old one. I led a
hundred men to his place in Granite Needle, but it was surrounded. The
Dark Ones guard it by night and by day they call out the Slayers. Ynyr
cannot get out and no one can get in.</p>
<p><strong>turold</strong>: How many did you lose?</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Sixty at the needle, another thirty in the
forest. Only ten of us made it back.</p>
<p><strong>turold</strong>: We will have to try again. His knowledge is
great. Without it, we cannot hope to win.</p>
<p><strong>councilor</strong>: Lord Turold and his son, my lady.</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: He has turned out well.</p>
<p><strong>turold</strong>: Middling well.</p>
<p><strong>turold</strong>: Though a touch too tall for <u>my</u>
taste.</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: My daughter is in the north tower. Go to
her.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: In my armor?</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: If she’s to marry a warrior, she’d best get
used to it.</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: What news from our friends?</p>
<p><strong>turold</strong>: Barak is still strong in the north, and
Tendo holds the high passes. But the great desert forts have fallen.</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: Freylag’s stronghold?</p>
<p><strong>turold</strong>: It has been taken, Freylag and all his
people slaughtered.</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: It is only a few weeks and already half our
strong places have fallen.</p>
<p><strong>turold</strong>: The attacks are unceasing: by night, the
Dark Ones; by day, those of our people who have sold themselves to them,
those traitors who are called the Slayers.</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: It is the way of all invaders. Those they
would conquer they divide, buying allies with promises of land and
power.</p>
<p><strong>turold</strong>: We will hold. Their power is not
unlimited.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: I’m Colwyn.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Are you Lyssa?</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: I don’t care what arrangements were made by
our parents. You don’t have to go through with it!</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: They can’t force you. I won’t let them!</p>
<p><strong>lyssa</strong>: I’m sorry. I couldn’t help it.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: I don’t have to go through with it
either.</p>
<p><strong>lyssa</strong>: You don’t understand. I’m just so
<u>relieved</u>. I was <u>sure</u> you’d turn out to be short and fat
and gimpy.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Oh. That. I know what you mean. I had
nightmares all week.</p>
<p><strong>lyssa</strong>: Me too.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Last night was the worst. I dreamt you had
one leg shorter than the other, and walked like a penguin.</p>
<p><strong>lyssa</strong>: Mine was worse: I dreamt you picked your nose
in public.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: That’s worse.</p>
<p><strong>lyssa</strong>: You’re really not bad looking. Almost
handsome.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Well, you’re beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>lyssa</strong>: You <u>might</u> be handsome. I can’t tell
through all that grime. Besides, you reek of sweat and horses.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: If you’re going to marry a warrior, you’d
best get used to it.</p>
<p><strong>lyssa</strong>: I have no intention of getting used to
it.</p>
<p><strong>lyssa</strong>: Take off your clothes. I’m going to scrub you
down.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: <u>What</u>?</p>
<p><strong>lyssa</strong>: We’re almost married.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: We’re not married <u>yet</u>.</p>
<p><strong>lyssa</strong>: Well, then you can go up to the parapet and
I’ll hand the buckets up to you.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Do I have to? I have to.</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: Lord Rowan is one of Lyssa’s godfathers. He
will defend her in the ceremony. I wish that Lord Modred were here. He
is a godfather of her own blood.</p>
<p><strong>turold</strong>: Modred has treated with the Dark Ones.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Modred! Impossible!</p>
<p><strong>turold</strong>: He leads a group of Slayers, under the
leopard banner.</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: For some, the lure of power is stronger than
the ties of blood. No matter. I had hoped to have the wedding next
spring, Lord Turold, with all the nobles of the kingdom in attendance.
But Fate and this war have ordained otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>turold</strong>: It is important to assure the
succession.</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: I will tell you something you did not know,
Turold. Had it been my choice, all those years ago, I would have chosen
you for my king. But my parents chose otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>turold</strong>: I knew.</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: You knew! You are a rude bumpkin!</p>
<p><strong>turold</strong>: That I am, my lady.</p>
<p><strong>turold</strong>: And, it seems, so is my son.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Just hand me the bucket! What are you
doing!</p>
<p><strong>lyssa</strong>: I don’t trust you to wash behind your
ears.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Never mind my ears! Go away!</p>
<p><strong>turold</strong>: A girl of some spirit, your daughter.</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: A match for your son, I think.</p>
<p><strong>turold</strong>: A fine match.</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: They will have the life that you and I might
have had.</p>
<p><strong>lyssa</strong>: There. Now you look like someone I might want
to marry.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Maybe you’d better look around for another
candidate. I don’t think my skin is tough enough to survive a lifetime
of you and your brush.</p>
<p><strong>lyssa</strong>: I don’t have to look around. I’ve found the
husband I want. You can kiss me now.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Thank you, but I can wait.</p>
<p><strong>lyssa</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: I lied.</p>
<p><strong>lyssa</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: I can’t wait either.</p>
<p><strong>turold</strong>: You’ll both wait. At least for five hours.
The wedding is at three.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: It was a platonic kiss, Father.</p>
<p><strong>turold</strong>: Of course it was.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: I am Colwyn, son of Turold, of the eagle’s
blood, and I am come to take your daughter from you.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: You shall not!</p>
<p><strong>lyssa</strong>: I am Lyssa, daughter of the Queen, of the
leopard’s blood, and I am come to take your son from you.</p>
<p><strong>turold</strong>: You shall not!</p>
<p><strong>turold</strong>: Let it be done then.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: It is done.</p>
<p><strong>turold</strong>: Slayers! To arms!</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: Help me up. I will die on my feet.</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: And I will not die alone.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: They have Lyssa!</p>
<p><strong>turold</strong>: You can’t reach her! Through the door.
Quickly!</p>
<p><strong>turold</strong>: The passage. Open it.</p>
<p><strong>turold</strong>: You will go alone.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: I won’t leave you here.</p>
<p><strong>turold</strong>: You will do as I tell you. You will try to
reach Ynyr, the old one.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: I must follow the Slayers. They’ve taken
Lyssa.</p>
<p><strong>turold</strong>: You will not follow the Slayers, you will
obey my command! You have no chance alone, boy. You must try to break
through to Ynyr. He has great knowledge. Only with his help can you save
Lyssa.</p>
<p><strong>turold</strong>: Go now. Go! I command you!</p>
<p><strong>turold</strong>: Spare him, Modred. Have you never loved
anyone?</p>
<p><strong>modred</strong>: If I spare him, they will kill me.</p>
<p><strong>turold</strong>: He is your godson now. He and Lyssa were
married.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: The old man must sleep sometime.</p>
<p><strong>slayer</strong>: Yes, sometime. But when?</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Perhaps now.</p>
<p><strong>slayer</strong>: Perhaps you’d like to stroll across the
bridge and find out.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Perhaps I will.</p>
<p><strong>2nd slayer</strong>: Go right ahead, brother, and let the old
man put you to sleep forever … … along with them.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: I am Colwyn, son of Turold!</p>
<p><strong>slayer</strong>: There is no way out. He will die there with
the old man.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: The White Castle has fallen.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: Does the Queen live?</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: The new Queen lives.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: Turold’s son was to marry her.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: We were married. Then she was taken by the
Slayers. You must help me.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: I have lived in this place, like my fathers
before me, guarding the old knowledge. I knew, when I had no son, that
the Great War would come in my time, and that I would be the one to pass
on the old knowledge to a new king. Come.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: It is night. The Slayers have gone to their
tents and the bridge is guarded by Dark Ones. They will not cross, for
they have no power in this place.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: This is not the first time the Dark Ones have
attacked our world. They came once before, a thousand years ago. A young
king and queen, with extraordinary powers, were given to us then, to
lead the struggle. My fore-father was their Councilor, as I will be
yours.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: I have no extraordinary powers.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: Your powers are greater than you know. Have
you ever seen one of these?</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: In the old books. It’s called a glaive.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: This belonged to the young king who fought the
Dark Ones a thousand years ago. Now it is yours.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: With two or three days’ practice, you’ll be
able to use it as well as I can. Then we’ll have a chance of fighting
our way out of here.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Two or three days! While Lyssa is in their
hands?</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: There is no other way.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: But there is another entrance to this
place.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: But it opens onto the sheer wall of the
Needle. There’s no way down.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: You have rope?</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: I am too old to climb down a rope.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: You won’t have to.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: Focus on the glaive.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: Reach out with your mind. Reach out to
Lyssa.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: There is nothing.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: Reach out farther. Call to her.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Lyssa … Lyssa …</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Lyssa … Lyssa …</p>
<p><strong>lyssa</strong>: Colwyn.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Have they harmed you?</p>
<p><strong>lyssa</strong>: No. They watch me closely, but they haven’t
harmed me.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: Where? We must know where she is.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Lyssa. Where are they keeping you?</p>
<p><strong>lyssa</strong>: In a great fortress in the mountains. Wait.
Something’s happening.</p>
<p><strong>lyssa</strong>: Everything’s changed. Now the fortress is in
the jungle.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: Enough, boy.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: Enough!</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: You must break when the strain becomes too
great, or you will harm yourself. And you must concentrate your powers
for when they are needed most. What did she answer?</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: She was in a great fortress, first in the
mountains, then in the jungle. How is that possible?</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: It is the Fortress of Krull. I know it only
from the stories of wars on other worlds. They did not use it on our
world in the first great war, for it costs them enormous power. This
time they mean to conquer, at all costs.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: The Fortress moves?</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: Yes. Each dawn it rises in a different land:
sometimes in the mountains, sometimes in the jungle, sometimes the
desert, sometimes the sea. Never in the same place twice.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Then even if Lyssa tells us where she is,
we’ll never be able to reach her, for they will never allow the Fortress
to rise near us.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: No. They occupy the Fortress, but they cannot
control its movement. It is moved by Fate. And, sooner or later, Fate
will place it near us.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Then we must be ready. Five leagues from
here is the Eastern Tower. I know the Barons who hold it. Good men, and
brave. They will help us.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: You have not slept in two days.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Nor will I, till my bride is beside me.</p>
<p><strong>lyssa</strong>: Colwyn. Colwyn.</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: Help! Help! I’m drowning!</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: I doubt it. The water is only an inch
deep.</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: It could have been quicksand! I might have
been sucked to my death. Where is this place?</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: A forest near the Valley of Needles.</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: Blast! A thousand miles off course. Well, I
was rushed. There was a certain difference of opinion concerning a
venison pie. The foolish man left it sitting on his windowsill. What did
he expect?</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Perhaps he expected to eat it.</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: For that rudeness, peasant lout, I am going to
leave you hanging by your heels when I depart. Which is right now.</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: Get me down from here!</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: My spells always go wrong when I am observed.
Be gone!</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: The forest is not safe these days. You’d best
travel with us.</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: I just remembered I have urgent business in
this direction.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: What business?</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: Staying alive.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: The lad is quick, very quick.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: But also very young. Six to one is no odds,
boy.</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: Get me down from here you louts or I’ll turn
you all into pigs!</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: They’ll soon learn the price of snaring Ergo
the Magnificent.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: When your enemies outnumber you, boy, craft
is more profitable than courage. Smile and go along and, sooner or
later, they will grow careless. And then … … sst!</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: I don’t think you’ll grow careless.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: Smart as well as quick. Now what do you
have to give us?</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Fame.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: Fame? Thank you, no. Fame is the burial
ground of contentment. Eat it and go hungry; count it and go broke; seek
it and grow mad. Fame is what fools yearn for and wise men shun.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Fame is what you leave to your sons.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: How did you know I had sons?</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Because you would not rob if you had no
children to provide for.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: Hah! You don’t know me, boy.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: I know you.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: You choose these?</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Yes. They will be more help than high-born
barons.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: They stand at the edge of the grave and
make jokes. Do you know who I am, sprout? I am Torquil, Lord of the
forest. My men follow no man but me, and I follow no man at all.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: You will follow me.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: And in the few seconds before I dice you to
crow-food, tell me why I am going to follow you.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: So your sons will speak of you to your
grandsons, and your grandsons to their grandsons.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: And where do you lead, boy?</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: To the place where Death lives.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: It should be an interesting journey,
then.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: That I promise you.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: I compel no man to follow me on this
journey.</p>
<p><strong>kegan</strong>: We owe you our lives, Torquil. If you follow
the boy, so also do we.</p>
<p><strong>sweyn</strong>: I follow the man who follows gold. He who
follows glory travels without me.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: Go then, and let greed be your
gravestone.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: What have we here? Roast pork for
dinner.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: He needs his book.</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: Put me down, you lout!</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: You had better manners as a pig.</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: I am Ergo the Magnificent, and I do not travel
with thieves and robbers.</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: Except when necessary.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: When did you last sleep, boy?</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: I’m all right.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: They burn many villages. Even walled cities
fall to them.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Why do they burn the villages? There’s
nothing to gain.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: There’s terror to gain. Their wealth is fear:
they get it with fire, they spend it to rule.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: We’ll stop here to hunt. Even those who
don’t sleep must eat.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: I’m not hungry.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: Not sleepy, either?</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: Bring me a deer! No deer, no supper.</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: What are you doing with my dear? Stop!
Thieves!</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: Many villagers are hiding in the forest.
They need food.</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: And do you think I live on air?</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: We have plenty of hares.</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: Food for crows.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: Surely a sorcerer of the sauce pan can make
rabbit taste like venison.</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: I am being exploited! Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: I must take the old man to see some sick
children. Kegan will guard you.</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: One with red eyes, the other with one eye,
both trying to kill me.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: The one with red eyes was a Dark One, the
other was a Cyclops, and it was not you he meant to kill.</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: He was aiming a huge spear right at me!</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: If that were so, you’d be dead now. He was
aiming at the Dark One, for there is ancient hatred between them. Once
his race had two eyes, like other men, until his forefathers bargained
with the Dark Ones: they gave up one of their eyes in return for the
power to see the future. But they were cheated, for the only future they
were permitted to see was the time of their own death.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: They know when they’re going to die?</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: Everyone of his race is born knowing the day
of his death.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: Knowledge I wouldn’t want.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: No. They are sad, solitary creatures, rarely
seen.</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: Once is enough, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: He saved our lives.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: But not our supper.</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: Oh, my poor stew!</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: Oh, my poor stomach.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: I can’t reach her.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: What do you see?</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Darkness. Tunnels and corridors. Wait.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Lyssa …</p>
<p><strong>lyssa</strong>: Colwyn …</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Where is the Fortress?</p>
<p><strong>lyssa</strong>: I don’t know. It’s a maze of tunnels. I can’t
see out.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: I will find you. I will be with you.</p>
<p><strong>lyssa</strong>: I know it.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: I love you, Lyssa, I love you …</p>
<p><strong>lyssa</strong>: Colwyn. Colwyn. I love you, Colwyn.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: She can’t see out. She can’t tell us where
the Fortress is.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: Yes, they knew of your first contact, so they
drove her below.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: She was very faint. I was barely able to
reach her.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: The deeper she goes, the harder it is to
contact her. Once she is below the second level, you will not be able to
reach her at all.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: I will find her!</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: We’ll seek an Emerald Seer. They have great
powers of vision.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: There’s an Emerald Circle a few leagues
from here. We’ll find her.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Forgive me. It’s childish to cry.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: Those are not child’s tear. A child cries
for himself, a man cries for those he loves.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: We can save half a day by crossing the
Stone Lake.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: Many have perished in that maze.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: No maze to me, my fried. It is where we
take refuge when they hunt us.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Lead us across.</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: I wish you’d tell me why that foolish boy
decided to join up with these thieves.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: He didn’t join them. They joined him.</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: And who is <u>he</u> that they should join
<u>him</u>?</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: He is the King.</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: Well, at least I’m glad to see you have a
sense of humor. That’s the first smile I’ve seen on that gloomy face of
your’s … … isn’t it? It isn’t. Oh no. Oh dear. Oh now I’ve gone and done
it.</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: Your kingship … your lord high mightiness …
when I called you a … a … whatever I called you, I didn’t realize that
you were … were …</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: I was hoping I might be your friend.</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: My <u>friend</u>.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: I have need of friends.</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: No more, my lord - my friend. With Ergo the
Magnificent by your side, your enemies are dead men.</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: Argh! I’m dying!</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Not yet, my friend. It’s your tomato that’s
dying.</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: Oh, my poor baby.</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: I liked you better gloomy, old man.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: So. You’re something more than a seeker of
fame.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: Well, I’m not impressed.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: I knew you would not be. That’s why I chose
you.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: I’m a <u>little</u> impressed.</p>
<p><strong>seer</strong>: Eight come here, Brother. They have traveled
far. Fetch bread and wine.</p>
<p><strong>titch</strong>: Yes, Brother.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: We seek the Fortress of Krull.</p>
<p><strong>seer</strong>: Such a vision will be opposed. Who seeks
it?</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: The new King.</p>
<p><strong>seer</strong>: With an old voice?</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: You know the voice.</p>
<p><strong>seer</strong>: Yes. You have left your place in the Needle.
It is the time, then.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: It is the time.</p>
<p><strong>seer</strong>: I will seek the Fortress for you.</p>
<p><strong>seer</strong>: Can you see?</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: Yes. It is the Western Ocean.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: There is a prisoner there.</p>
<p><strong>seer</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Lyssa.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Are you hurt?</p>
<p><strong>seer</strong>: No. The Dark Ones do not like curious Seers
poking into their affairs.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Can you tell us where the Fortress will rise
tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>seer</strong>: I cannot see the future, only the present. But
at dawn tomorrow, I can see where the fortress has risen that day - and
every day thereafter, until Fate brings it near us.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: The Dark Ones will appose you with all their
power.</p>
<p><strong>seer</strong>: They will fail for, during the day, the power
of the Circle is greater than theirs. Only at night can they pierce the
Circle.</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: Bread is for peasants, and wine makes me
sneeze. Got any gumdrops?</p>
<p><strong>titch</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: Sugarballs?</p>
<p><strong>titch</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: What kind of a boy are you? Boys always have
candy.</p>
<p><strong>titch</strong>: I have a cinnamon bar.</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: You do?</p>
<p><strong>titch</strong>: You can have half.</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: I am Ergo the Magnificent … … short in stature
… … tall in power … … narrow of purpose … … wide of vision.</p>
<p><strong>titch</strong>: I … … am Titch.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: I cannot reach her.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: She is too deep. The curved tunnel we saw is
part of the Vortex, the place of The Beast.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: The leader of the Dark Ones?</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: Yes. Like you, a King. A King of many worlds.
All enslaved.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: The first time, when they attacked long ago,
was The Beast here?</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: No. Then they were led by his underlings. But
I knew he had come this time, from the ferocity of their onslaught, from
their use of The Fortress. They use up much of their strength to do
these things. They are taking great risks.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: I’m not sure.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: But you suspect.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: You will know, in good time.</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: Rabbits and squirrels. Where is my deer!</p>
<p><strong>keegan</strong>: We saw nothing but does and fawns, and we
shoot only stags.</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: Nothing worse than lower-class boors with
upper-class morals.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: Would you settle for a boar?</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: A <u>boar</u>? Those incompetent louts
couldn’t catch a piglet, much less a boar.</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: You!</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: Me. May I eat with you tonight?</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: Tonight and every night, my friend, for this
is the second time you’ve saved my life. I am Ergo the Magnificent,
short in stature, tall in power, etcetera, etcetera.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: I am Quell.</p>
<p><strong>titch</strong>: I’m hungry.</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: Smart lad. Bring me my spices!</p>
<p><strong>titch</strong>: I must fetch my master. I’m Titch.</p>
<p><strong>seer</strong>: Is that you, Brother?</p>
<p><strong>changeling</strong>: It is me, Brother.</p>
<p><strong>changeling</strong>: Is that you, Brother?</p>
<p><strong>titch</strong>: It is me, Brother.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: Passable, pimple, very passable.</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: The greatest boon of your otherwise worthless
life, blockhead, is the privilege of dining on boar roasted by the hand
of Ergo the Magnificent.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: Your boast is a bigger mouthful than your
roast, Magnificence.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: You’ve eaten nothing.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: We must try to get horses.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: Yes. It will double our range. I know at
least a dozen ways to get horses. All cheap.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: These we’ll pay for.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: Lad, you have an unnatural desire to pay
for things. It stunts the mind and shrivels the imagination.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Hand over your dinner.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: A flicker of talent.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: But I can’t tell yet whether it’s a talent
for theft or gluttony.</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: If I could wish … … for anything, I’d wish for
a venison pie the size of a … … mountain. No, that’s too greedy. I’d
settle for one the size of a house.</p>
<p><strong>titch</strong>: I’d wish for a puppy.</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: One puppy? Why not wish for a hundred?</p>
<p><strong>titch</strong>: I only want one.</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: A foolish wish. And you, Quell?</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: Ignorance.</p>
<p><strong>bardolph</strong>: Who’s there?</p>
<p><strong>changeling</strong>: It’s me, Brother. I am thirsty.</p>
<p><strong>bardolph</strong>: Here, I’ll guide you.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Where is Bardolph, Brother?</p>
<p><strong>changeling</strong>: He heard something and went to
investigate, Brother.</p>
<p><strong>changeling</strong>: Lead me to the stream, Brother.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: A Changeling.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: Yes. It chose the Seer’s form so it wouldn’t
have to show its eyes.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: How did you know?</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: I found the body of the Seer in the
stream.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: If he had not agreed to help us, they would
not have killed him. He gave his life for us.</p>
<p><strong>titch</strong>: He was my only family.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: We’re your family now.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: I must go to the widow. Perhaps she will
help.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: The Widow of the Web?</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: That creature helps no one. And none who go
there return.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: She has the power of vision.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: She has the power to kill.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: Perhaps she will not kill me, for I know her
name.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: Her name is Death.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: She had another name once.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: No. We will find another way to locate the
Fortress.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: There is no other way. You asked me why the
Beast had come this time.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: He has come for Lyssa.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Lyssa? <u>Why</u>?</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: Like you, she has extraordinary powers. He
would make her his Queen.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Can she be forced?</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: No. She must agree of her own free will.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Never.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: You are young. You don’t understand the
attraction of great power, and you forget the pain of long waiting.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Then we must reach her before she feels that
pain.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>voice of the beast</strong>: Do not be afraid. You are safe
here. You are protected by my power.</p>
<p><strong>voice of the beast</strong>: I am not one of those trivial
ones who have been guarding you. They are my slaves. They are to me as
drops to an ocean. <u>I rule here</u>.</p>
<p><strong>voice of the beast</strong>: I rule <u>all</u> here.</p>
<p><strong>voice of the beast</strong>: Nature is my slave here.</p>
<p><strong>voice of the beast</strong>: Its laws are mine to break.</p>
<p><strong>voice of the beast</strong>: Such is my power. It can be
yours.</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: I still say it was a foolish wish.</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: What is that awful looking place?</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: The Swamp of Betrayal. Be glad we don’t
have to cross it.</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: I’m glad. I’m very glad.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Slayers!</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: We must enter the swamp.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: Few have survived it.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: Fewer will survive them.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Yes, it’s our only chance. They can’t use
their horses there. Quickly.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: Do not let the waters touch you.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: What will happen?</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: You will be devoured by your own mind.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: Take hold!</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: Let him drown.</p>
<p><strong>lyssa</strong>: Yes. Then we’ll marry and you will be my
king.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Traitor! She’ll marry you in hell!</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: He thinks you betray him with Lyssa. Colwyn!
The waters deceive you!</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: I have delivered him into your hands. Now pay
me the price we agreed on.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: I will melt that gold and pour it down your
throat, old man!</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: He sees betrayal everywhere. He will attack us
so long as he is conscious.</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: Your axe! Lay it out!</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: I can’t hold the weight of both of you!</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: Hush!</p>
<p><strong>chief slayer</strong>: Traitor!</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Forgive me, my friends. I saw terrible
things.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: They do not exist, except in the waters of
the Swamp, where they will remain.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: From here, I must go alone.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: You will tell me her name and we will go
together.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: You must never know her name. If more than one
approaches, she will certainly kill them. Alone I may have a chance.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: Each to his fate, lad.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: Each to his fate. Wait for me at the inn. If I
am not back by dawn, you will know my fate, and you must go on without
me.</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: We’ll meet you at the inn.</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: Can’t I come, too?</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: Over there.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Go, join them.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: What kind of friend do you think I am?</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: The best. But my unhappiness is not made
lighter by adding your’s to it.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: Well, it is true that if I received a royal
command I couldn’t very well disobey it, could I?</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Go. I command you.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: Yes, my lord.</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: Try your tricks on me and I’ll turn myself
back into a snake and bite you.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: You and I will guard the fire.</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: What else is left for a man without
friends.</p>
<p><strong>widow</strong>: Someone comes here.</p>
<p><strong>widow</strong>: This is his time.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: I am Ynyr. I seek the Widow.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: Lyssa!</p>
<p><strong>widow</strong>: Who speaks that name!</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: Ynyr!</p>
<p><strong>widow</strong>: It is fifty years since I heard that
name.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: It is fifty years since I spoke it to you.</p>
<p><strong>widow</strong>: I was beautiful then.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: The most beautiful woman in the world.</p>
<p><strong>widow</strong>: But you would not stay with me.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: Could not. Could not betray the girl to whom I
was betrothed.</p>
<p><strong>widow</strong>: She was not as beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: No, she was not as beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>widow</strong>: She bore you many children?</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: We had no children.</p>
<p><strong>widow</strong>: You had a son.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: You said nothing. You told me nothing.</p>
<p><strong>widow</strong>: You had left me! I kept silent out of
rage.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: Where is he? My son.</p>
<p><strong>widow</strong>: I killed him when he was born. This place is
my punishment.</p>
<p><strong>widow</strong>: Do not try your trickery on me!</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: It is no trickery.</p>
<p><strong>widow</strong>: Those are reflections. <u>This</u> is my
face!</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: You see?</p>
<p><strong>widow</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: Memory is no trick, it is a power. The power
to see.</p>
<p><strong>widow</strong>: Power you have given me. What can my power
give you?</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: Knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>widow</strong>: Of what?</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: The Fortress of Krull. When will it come near
here?</p>
<p><strong>widow</strong>: Why must you know?</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: There is a girl there. Her name is Lyssa.</p>
<p><strong>widow</strong>: You lie!</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: Could I lie to you and still see your
beauty?</p>
<p><strong>widow</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: A young man seeks her. A young man about the
age I was when I met you.</p>
<p><strong>widow</strong>: Tomorrow, the Fortress of Krull will rise
with the sun in the Valley of Reeds. But the knowledge is of no use to
you. No man has ever escaped the Web. And soon the creature will come
for you, even here.</p>
<p><strong>widow</strong>: It will not help.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: Then the other Lyssa will share your fate. She
will grow old in the Fortress as you have grown old here.</p>
<p><strong>widow</strong>: Hold out your hand.</p>
<p><strong>widow</strong>: Those are the sands of my life. So long as
they remain in your hand, the creature cannot harm you.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: I cannot stop the sand.</p>
<p><strong>widow</strong>: You cannot stop time. Go now, before it runs
out.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: You will come with me.</p>
<p><strong>widow</strong>: There is sand enough for only one life. Go
now, save the other.</p>
<p><strong>titch</strong>: Ergo?</p>
<p><strong>titch</strong>: Sir Ergo? … My honorable Lord Ergo? …</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: First, you desert me, and now you mock me. Go
back to your one-eyed friend.</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: What? Now you poke me in the nose as well?</p>
<p><strong>titch</strong>: I don’t think it’s working.</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: Not working? This nose? This nose works day
and night. This nose has never loafed an hour in its life. This nose …
What? Impossible. This nose asleep while venison fills the air? Where is
it, boy? Tell me where it is and I forgive you everything.</p>
<p><strong>titch</strong>: It’s right behind you.</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: A venison pie as big as a house.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: A small house.</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: And what do you think a small person lives in,
you one-eyed fool? Leaving me here to mope while you and the boy were
arranging my assassination.</p>
<p><strong>titch</strong>: We meant only to please you.</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: And do you think I’m not going to eat myself
to death this very night? Huh?</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: Look at its beauty. Look at its grace.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: Look at its insides.</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: No! Not yet! Let me hug it and kiss it a
little. Let me run my fingers over its lovely skin. Let me climb to the
top and sing to it.</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: Henceforth I am Lord Ergo, for now I have an
estate to rule.</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: Let us go then, you and I, my sweet and hot
and lovely pie …</p>
<p><strong>titch</strong>: Ergo? Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: Here lies Lord Ergo, drowned in a venison pie.
He died with a smile and a belch, goodbye, goodbye …</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: Lift him out.</p>
<p><strong>vella</strong>: It’s the little man called Ergo, isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>vella</strong>: He must care a lot for the boy.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>innkeeper</strong>: You lazy slut! I don’t pay you to stand
around jawing with the guests!</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Leave her be. She’s worked hard all day.</p>
<p><strong>innkeeper</strong>: She’ll work till dawn if I choose!</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Her working day is over. She’ll rest
now.</p>
<p><strong>voice of the beast</strong>: Have you considered?</p>
<p><strong>lyssa</strong>: I do not want your power. It is hideous.</p>
<p><strong>voice of the beast</strong>: You know nothing of power, you
foolish girl. You think power is a mighty sword, or a strong castle, or
the paltry magic of an Emerald Seer. Power is none of these.</p>
<p><strong>voice of the beast</strong>: Power is beauty.</p>
<p><strong>voice of the beast</strong>: Power is friendship.</p>
<p><strong>voice of the beast</strong>: Power is joy.</p>
<p><strong>voice of the beast</strong>: Power is desire.</p>
<p><strong>vella</strong>: The cruelest fate is to be far from the one
you love, not knowing whether you will ever see him again.</p>
<p><strong>vella</strong>: I was betrothed to a boy from my village. We
were to be married this summer, but he traveled across the sea and his
ship was lost. They say he drowned, but I know he is alive. I know he
will come back to me.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: I know the cruelty of such a fate.</p>
<p><strong>vella</strong>: Perhaps you think no man would return to
me.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: I don’t think that.</p>
<p><strong>vella</strong>: Am I not worth returning to?</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>vella</strong>: Am I not beautiful enough to be loved?</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>vella</strong>: Even by you?</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>voice of the beast</strong>: This I tell you: our children
will be princes. They will have the power of my darkness and the power
of your blood. They will conquer galaxies.</p>
<p><strong>voice of the beast</strong>: They will make you a queen. A
queen of worlds uncountable.</p>
<p><strong>voice of the beast</strong>: These are the galaxies you will
rule.</p>
<p><strong>voice of the beast</strong>: These are the worlds of your
empire.</p>
<p><strong>voice of the beast</strong>: These are the beings who will be
your slaves.</p>
<p><strong>lyssa</strong>: I do not want your worlds or your slaves.</p>
<p><strong>voice of the beast</strong>: Then look!</p>
<p><strong>lyssa</strong>: It’s a lie!</p>
<p><strong>voice of the beast</strong>: These walls do not lie! He will
betray you.</p>
<p><strong>lyssa</strong>: He will not!</p>
<p><strong>voice of the beast</strong>: Then he will die!</p>
<p><strong>vella</strong>: You too are lonely.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: I ache with it.</p>
<p><strong>vella</strong>: Let me comfort you.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: I cannot take comfort when she has none.</p>
<p><strong>vella</strong>: Then give me comfort. Sleep with me
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: I cannot betray my bride.</p>
<p><strong>vella</strong>: One night is no betrayal. Have pity on me.
Please, I beg you, do not refuse me. You do not know the price.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: I feel your pain, but I cannot betray
her.</p>
<p><strong>vella</strong>: You will not, then?</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: I cannot.</p>
<p><strong>vella</strong>: My master told me: make him betray her; if he
will not, kill him.</p>
<p><strong>vella</strong>: Yes, <u>he</u> is my master.</p>
<p><strong>vella</strong>: These talons were a heartbeat from your
throat. I could have killed you in an instant.</p>
<p><strong>vella</strong>: But in the hour I knew you, I loved you. That
love is life for you and death for me. Remember me.</p>
<p><strong>lyssa</strong>: It is you who are betrayed.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Have faith, Lyssa. I will come.</p>
<p><strong>lyssa</strong>: He will come for me.</p>
<p><strong>voice of the beast</strong>: He will not come. You will be my
queen.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: We must reach the Valley of Reeds before the
next dawn.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: It’s a hundred leagues from here.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: We could reach it on fire-mares.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: Those beasts cannot be saddled by mortal
men.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: They can be saddled.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: You have done it?</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: I road them often in my youth.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Saddles.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: The innkeeper.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: It is dangerous for you.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: It will only be a few hours. Then I will
accept my fate.</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: They’ll trample him to death!</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: No. He will master the leader.</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: Quell?</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: I cannot go with you, my friend.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: It is today?</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: Yes. It is today.</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: My heart stays here.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: And mine goes with you.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: You’re too young to come with us, lad. Stay
with our friend.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Each to his fate.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: Each to his fate.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: He ran a great risk, helping us today. If he
opposes his fate, his death will be terribly painful.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Let us wish him peace.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: We must cover a hundred leagues before
sunrise.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: At the gallop!</p>
<p><strong>gatekeeper</strong>: If they’re nobles, it’ll cost ’em
gold.</p>
<p><strong>gatekeeper</strong>: I would’ve settled for silver.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: To your places. If they resist, show no
mercy!</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Hold, or you are dead men!</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: It’s almost dawn! Flank them!</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Up the wall! Quickly!</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: Look out!</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: On them!</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: A man can ask nothing more than that his
death help his friends.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: I’ll stay behind and keep them busy.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: It is not necessary. They will not follow.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: Look.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: Yes, they are weakening. It takes great power
to maintain the Fortress, and they have expended much.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: They’re gaining on us. We must slow them up
with steel.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Better stone than steel.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: You’re resourceful, my lad. I tell you, one
year under my tutelage and I could make you the Prince of Thieves.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Subject to the King, no doubt.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: Naturally.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: A good thrust, my friend. Another second
and there’d have been nothing between my head and shoulders but bad
memories.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: I intend to keep you alive, your majesty. So
you can abdicate your throne and become my Warlord.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: Perhaps. If the pay is good.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Stay together.</p>
<p><strong>old torquil</strong>: Torquil …</p>
<p><strong>old torquil</strong>: Do not let this happen, Torquil.</p>
<p><strong>priestess</strong>: It need not happen, Torquil. Drink the
rainbow. It is youth.</p>
<p><strong>priestess</strong>: It is <u>your</u> youth, Torquil.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: This is the Cavern of Age. Touch nothing, take
nothing, or the future will be plunged into your heart.</p>
<p><strong>priestess</strong>: Drink the rainbow, Torquil. Youth is
yours. I am yours. Take me, Torquil.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: She lies, my friend.</p>
<p><strong>old ergo</strong>: Ergo, save yourself. Save yourself from
this.</p>
<p><strong>fairy priestess</strong>: Drink from my hand, Ergo. I can
save you.</p>
<p><strong>titch</strong>: Ergo!</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: Oh, she was so beautiful - and I was so
<u>ugly</u>.</p>
<p><strong>titch</strong>: Would you desert your friends?</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: No, no. I’m with you, boy.</p>
<p><strong>old kegan</strong>: Disease and pain, Kegan. This is your
future.</p>
<p><strong>very young priestess</strong>: Oh please, Kegan, don’t let
this happen. Come to me as you were.</p>
<p><strong>very young priestess</strong>: Come to me young, Kegan.</p>
<p><strong>very young priestess</strong>: Your youth is in the goblet,
come to me in the rainbow.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: Kegan!</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: It is too late. He has drunk.</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: Keep a tight hold, boy, in case I get any more
crazy ideas.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: They will hold Lyssa in the Center of the
Vortex, the place of the Beast, where its power is greatest. No man can
match it there. Lyssa must try to move toward us. For as we enter the
Vortex and move closer …</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: The Beast will kill her.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: Yes. To keep her from you. But now that we are
inside the Fortress, you will be able to contact her.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Lyssa …</p>
<p><strong>lyssa</strong>: Colwyn …</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: You must move away from the Center.</p>
<p><strong>lyssa</strong>: All the passages are guarded.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: She must make a glaive.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Lyssa, your bracelets. Bend them straight
and cross them.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Now grip them in your hand.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Will your power outward.</p>
<p><strong>lyssa</strong>: I don’t know how.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: You have the power. <u>Will it</u>.</p>
<p><strong>lyssa</strong>: Yes. I can do it.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: West.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Take the western passage.</p>
<p><strong>lyssa</strong>: All directions are the same here.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: The spiral begins in the west.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Where the spiral begins.</p>
<p><strong>lyssa</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Move quickly. We are coming for you. We are
in the Fortress.</p>
<p><strong>lyssa</strong>: I knew you would come.</p>
<p><strong>lyssa</strong>: Colwyn. Where are you, Colwyn?</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: We should have reached her by now.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Lyssa …</p>
<p><strong>lyssa</strong>: Come quickly, Colwyn. I can see the eyes of
the Beast.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Lyssa, touch the wall of your passage.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: She’s on the other side of this wall. I can
feel it!</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: I chose the wrong passage.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: She can see the Beast!</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: Use your sword.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: What use is my sword? I can’t reach her!</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: Cut. <u>Cut</u>!</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: You must move quickly. The Beast will stop at
nothing now.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: You’re coming with us.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: It is my fate to die in the Fortress.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: No! You cannot know that!</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: I can. Because I choose it.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: I forbid you!</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: I didn’t mean it that way. But you cannot
stay.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: Go now. Quell was wise. He knew that a man
cannot ask more of his death than it help his friends.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: That is true.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: Take care of Ergo.</p>
<p><strong>titch</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Quickly, or he will waste his life for
nothing.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: You and I were destined to meet, my
friend.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: And I am not so old that I can be swatted like
a fly.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: No, not so old as that, my black beauty.</p>
<p><strong>ynyr</strong>: Yes, you will have to attack me directly to
kill me. I will cost you power, my dark friend. Much power.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: We must find a smaller passage, where it
cannot follow.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: Which one?</p>
<p><strong>lyssa</strong>: Where is the Fortress?</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: In the Arctic ice.</p>
<p><strong>lyssa</strong>: That way. I can feel the cold.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: She’s right. Look.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Make for the wall. I’ll catch up.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: Colwyn, don’t be a fool. You can’t do
battle with that thing.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: There’s no way to outrun it. You know that.
This is what Ynyr was preparing me for. It’s what he died for.</p>
<p><strong>lyssa</strong>: You’ll be killed.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: Don’t worry. I’ll tap him on the head with
my sword hilt if I have to.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: You’ll lead the others to the wall as I tell
you. <u>Now</u>.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: I am no feeble old man for you to crush with
two blows. This is for that old man.</p>
<p><strong>torquil</strong>: I’ll get him. Make for the wall.</p>
<p><strong>ergo</strong>: Quickly, quickly to the wall.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Wait!</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Away from the wall!</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: It’s a fitting monument for Ynyr and Quell
and the others.</p>
<p><strong>lyssa</strong>: That’s a better one.</p>
<p><strong>colwyn</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>lyssa</strong>: Where’s Ergo?</p>
