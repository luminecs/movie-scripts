<p><strong>luke</strong>: Echo Three to Echo Seven. Han, old buddy, do
you read me?</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Loud and clear, kid. What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Well, I finished my circle. I don’t pick up
any life readings.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: There isn’t enough life on this ice cube to
fill a space cruiser. The sensors are placed, I’m going back.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Right. I’ll see you shortly. There’s a
meteorite that hit the ground near here. I want to check it out. It
won’t take long.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Hey, steady girl. What’s the matter? You smell
something?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Aaargh!</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Chewie!</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: All right, don’t lose your temper. I’ll come
right back and give you a hand.</p>
<p><strong>rieekan</strong>: Solo?</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: No sign of life out there, General. The sensors
are in place. You’ll know if anything comes around.</p>
<p><strong>rieekan</strong>: Commander Skywalker reported in yet?</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: No. He’s checking out a meteorite that hit near
him.</p>
<p><strong>rieekan</strong>: With all the meteor activity in this
system, it’s going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: General, I’ve got to leave. I can’t stay
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>rieekan</strong>: I’m sorry to hear that.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Well, there’s a price on my head. If I don’t
pay off Jabba the Hut, I’m a dead man.</p>
<p><strong>rieekan</strong>: A death mark’s not an easy thing to live
with. You’re a good fighter, Solo. I hate to lose you.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Thank you, General.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Well, Your Highness, I guess this is it.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Well, don’t get all mushy on me. So long,
Princess.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Han!</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Yes, Your Highnessness?</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: I thought you decided to stay.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Well, the bounty hunter we ran into on Ord
Mantell changed my mind.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Han, we need you!</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: We?</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Oh, what about you need?</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: I need? I don’t know what you’re talking
about.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: You probably don’t.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: And what precisely am I supposed to know?</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Come on! You want me to stay because of the way
you feel about me.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Yes. You’re a great help to us. You’re a
natural leader…</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: No! That’s not it. Come on. Aahhh - uh huh!
Come on.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: You’re imagining things.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Am I? Then why are you following me? Afraid I
was going to leave without giving you a goodbye kiss?</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: I’d just as soon kiss a Wookiee.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: I can arrange that. You could use a good
kiss!</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Don’t try to blame me. I didn’t ask you to
turn on the thermal heater. I merely commented that it was freezing in
the princess’ chamber. But it’s supposed to be freezing. How are we
going to dry out all her clothes? I really don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Oh, switch off.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Why do you take this apart now? I’m trying to
get us out of here and you pull both of these.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Excuse me, sir.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Put them back together right now.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Might I have a word with you, please?</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Well, it’s Princess Leia, sir. She’s been
trying to get you on the communicator.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: I turned it off. I don’t want to talk to
her.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Oh. Well, Princess Leia is wondering about
Master Luke. He hasn’t come back yet. She doesn’t know where he is.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: I don’t know where he is.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Nobody knows where he is.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: What do you mean, “nobody knows”?</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Well, uh, you see…</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Deck Officer. Deck Officer!</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Excuse me, sir. Might I inqu…</p>
<p><strong>deck officer</strong>: Yes, sir?</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Do you know where Commander Skywalker is?</p>
<p><strong>deck officer</strong>: I haven’t seen him. It’s possible he
came in through the south entrance.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: It’s possible? Why don’t you go find out? It’s
getting dark out there.</p>
<p><strong>deck officer</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Excuse me, sir. Might I inquire what’s
going on?</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Impossible man. Come along, Artoo, let’s
find Princess Leia. Between ourselves, I think Master Luke is in
considerable danger.</p>
<p><strong>deck officer</strong>: Sir, Commander Skywalker hasn’t come
in through the south entrance. He might have forgotten to check in.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Not likely. Are the speeders ready?</p>
<p><strong>deck officer</strong>: Not yet. We’re having some trouble
adapting them to the cold.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Then we’ll have to go out on Tauntauns.</p>
<p><strong>deck officer</strong>: Sir, the temperature’s dropping too
rapidly.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: That’s right. And my friends out in it.</p>
<p><strong>assistant officer</strong>: I’ll cover sector twelve. Have
com-control set screen alpha.</p>
<p><strong>deck officer</strong>: Your Tauntaun’ll freeze before you
reach the first marker.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Then I’ll see you in hell!</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: You must come along now, Artoo. There’s
really nothing more we can do. And my joints are freezing up.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Don’t say thing like that! Of course we’ll
see Master Luke again. He’ll be quite all right, you’ll see. Stupid
little short-circuit. He’ll be quite all right.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: Sir, all the patrols are in. There’s
still no contact from Skywalker or Solo.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Mistress Leia, Artoo says he’s been quite
unable to pick up any signals, although he does admit that his own range
is far too weak to abandon all hope.</p>
<p><strong>derlin</strong>: Your Highness, there’s nothing more we can
do tonight. The shield doors must be closed.</p>
<p><strong>derlin</strong>: Close the doors.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Artoo says the chances of survival are
seven hundred seventy-five… to one.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Actually, Artoo has been known to make
mistakes… from time to time. Oh, dear, oh, dear. Don’t worry about
Master Luke. I’m sure he’ll be all right. He’s quite clever, you know…
for a human being.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Luke… Luke.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Ben?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You will go to the Dagobah system.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Dagobah system?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: There you will learn from Yoda, the Jedi Master
who instructed me.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Ben… Ben.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Luke! Luke! Don’t do this, Luke. Come on, give
me a sign here.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Not much time.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Ben… Ben…</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Hang on, kid.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Dagobah system…</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Whew…</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Dagobah…</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: This may smell bad, kid…</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Yoda…</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: …but it will keep you warm… til I get the
shelter built. Luke inside the Ooh… I thought they smelled bad on the
outside!</p>
<p><strong>zev</strong>: Echo Base… I’ve got something! Not much, but it
could be a life form.</p>
<p><strong>zev</strong>: This is Rogue Two. this is Rogue Two. Captain
Solo, so you copy? Commander Skywalker, do you copy? This is Rogue
Two.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Good morning. Nice of you guys to drop by.</p>
<p><strong>zev</strong>: Echo Base… this is Rogue Two. I found them.
Repeat, I found them.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Master Luke, sir, it’s so good to see you
fully functional again.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Artoo expresses his relief, also.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: How are you feeling, kid? You don’t look so bad
to me. In fact, you look strong enough to pull the ears off a
Gundark.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Thanks to you.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: That’s two you owe me, junior.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Well your Worship, looks like you managed to
keep me around for a little while longer.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: I had nothing to do with it. General Rieekan
thinks it’s dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we’ve
activated the energy shield.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: That’s a good story. I think you just can’t
bear to let a gorgeous guy like me out of your sight.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: I don’t know where you get your delusions,
laser brain.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Laugh it up, fuzzball. But you didn’t see us
alone in the south passage.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: She expressed her true feelings for me.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: My…! Why, you stuck up,… half- witted…
scruffy-looking …nerf- herder!</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Who’s scruffy-looking? I must have hit pretty
close to the mark to get her all riled up like that, huh, kid?</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Why, I guess you don’t know everything about
women yet?</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Headquarters personnel, report to command
center.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Take it easy.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Excuse us, please.</p>
<p><strong>rieekan</strong>: Princess… we have a visitor.</p>
<p><strong>rieekan</strong>: We’ve picked up something outside the base
in zone twelve, moving east.</p>
<p><strong>senior controller</strong>: It’s metal.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Then it couldn’t be one of those creatures
that attacked Luke.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: It could be a speeder, one of ours.</p>
<p><strong>senior controller</strong>: No. Wait - there’s something very
weak coming through.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Sir, I am fluent in six million forms of
communication. This signal is not used by the Alliance. It could be an
Imperial code.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: It isn’t friendly, whatever it is. Come on,
Chewie, let’s check it out.</p>
<p><strong>rieekan</strong>: Send Rogues Ten and Eleven to station
three-eight.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Afraid there’s not much left.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: What was it?</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Droid of some kind. I didn’t hit it that hard.
It must have had a self-destruct.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: An Imperial probe droid.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: It’s a good bet the Empire knows we’re
here.</p>
<p><strong>rieekan</strong>: We’d better start the evacuation.</p>
<p><strong>piett</strong>: Admiral.</p>
<p><strong>ozzel</strong>: Yes, Captain</p>
<p><strong>piett</strong>: I think we’ve got something, sir. The report
is only a fragment from a probe droid in the Hoth system, but it’s the
best lead we’ve had.</p>
<p><strong>ozzel</strong>: We have thousands of probe droids searching
the galaxy. I want proof, not leads!</p>
<p><strong>piett</strong>: The visuals indicate life readings.</p>
<p><strong>ozzel</strong>: It could mean anything. If we followed every
lead…</p>
<p><strong>piett</strong>: But, sir, the Hoth system is supposed to be
devoid of human forms.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: You found something?</p>
<p><strong>piett</strong>: Yes, my lord.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: That’s it. The Rebels are there.</p>
<p><strong>ozzel</strong>: My lord, there are so many uncharted
settlements. It could be smugglers, it could be…</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: That is the system. And I’m sure Skywalker is
with them. Set your course for the Hoth system. General Veers, prepare
you men.</p>
<p><strong>rebel captain</strong>: Groups seven and ten will stay behind
to fly the speeders. As soon as each transport is loaded, evacuation
control will give clearance for immediate launch.</p>
<p><strong>rebel fighter</strong>: Right, sir.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Okay, that’s it. Try it… Off! Turn it off! Turn
it off! Off!</p>
<p><strong>medical droid</strong>: Sir, it will take quite a while to
evacuate the T-forty- sevens.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Well, forget the heavy equipment. There’s
plenty of time to get the smaller modules on the transports.</p>
<p><strong>medical droid</strong>: Take care, sir.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Chewie, take care of yourself, okay?</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Hi, kid. There’s got to be a reason for it.
Check it at the other end. Wait a second. You all right?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Be careful.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: You, too.</p>
<p><strong>controller</strong>: General, there’s a fleet of Star
Destroyers coming out of hyperspace in sector four.</p>
<p><strong>rieekan</strong>: Reroute all power to the energy shield.
We’ve got to hold them till all transports are away. Prepare for ground
assault.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: What is it, General?</p>
<p><strong>veers</strong>: My lord, the fleet has moves out of
light-speed. Com-Scan has detected an energy field protecting an area
around the sixth planet of the Hoth system. The field is strong enough
to deflect any bombardment.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: The Rebels are alerted to our presence.
Admiral Ozzel came out of light-speed too close to the system.</p>
<p><strong>veers</strong>: He felt surprise was wiser…</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: He is as clumsy as he is stupid. General,
prepare your troops for a surface attack.</p>
<p><strong>veers</strong>: Yes, my lord.</p>
<p><strong>ozzel</strong>: Lord Vader, the fleet has moved out of
light-speed, and we’re preparing to… Aaagh!</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: You have failed me for the last time,
Admiral. Captain Piett.</p>
<p><strong>piett</strong>: Yes, my lord.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: Make ready to land out troops beyond the
energy shield and deploy the fleet so that nothing gets off that system.
You are in command now, Admiral Piett.</p>
<p><strong>piett</strong>: Thank you, Lord Vader.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: All troop carriers will assemble at the north
entrance. The heavy transport ships will leave as soon as they’re
loaded. Only two fighter escorts per ship. The energy shield can only be
opened for a short time, so you’ll have to stay very close to your
transports.</p>
<p><strong>hobbie</strong>: Two fighters against a Star Destroyer?</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: The ion cannon will fire several shots to make
sure that any enemy ships will be out of your flight path. When you’ve
gotten past the energy shield, proceed directly to the rendezvous point.
Understood?</p>
<p><strong>pilots</strong>: Right. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>derlin</strong>: Okay. Everyone to your stations. Let’s
go!</p>
<p><strong>rieekan</strong>: Their primary target will be the power
generators. Prepare to open the shield.</p>
<p><strong>controller</strong>: Sir, Rebel ships are coming into our
sector.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Good. Our first catch of the day.</p>
<p><strong>woman controller</strong>: Stand by, ion control… Fire!</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: The first transport is away.</p>
<p><strong>dack</strong>: Feeling all right, sir?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Just like new, Dack. How about you?</p>
<p><strong>dack</strong>: Right now I feel like I could take on the
whole Empire myself.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I know what you mean.</p>
<p><strong>trench officer</strong>: Echo Station Three-T-Eight.</p>
<p><strong>trench officer</strong>: We have spotted Imperial
walkers!</p>
<p><strong>controller</strong>: Imperial walkers on the north ridge.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Echo station Five-Seven. We’re on our way.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: All right, boys, keep tight now.</p>
<p><strong>dack</strong>: Luke, I have no approach vector. I’m not
set.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Steady, Dack. Attack pattern delta. Go
now!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: All right, I’m coming in.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Hobbie, you still with me?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: That armor’s too strong for blasters.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Rogue Group, use your harpoons and tow cables.
Go for the legs. It might be our only chance of stopping them. All
right, stand by, Dack.</p>
<p><strong>dack</strong>: Luke, we’ve got a malfunction in fire control.
I’ll have to cut in the auxiliary.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Just hang on. Hang on, Dack. Get ready to fire
that tow cable.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Dack? Dack!</p>
<p><strong>veers</strong>: Yes, Lord Vader. I’ve reached the main power
generator. The shield will be down in moments. You may start your
landing.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Rogue Three.</p>
<p><strong>wedge</strong>: Copy, Rogue Leader</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Wedge, I’ve lost my gunner. You’ll have to
make this shot. I’ll cover for you. Set your harpoon. Follow me on the
next pass.</p>
<p><strong>wedge</strong>: Coming around, Rogue Leader.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Steady, Rogue Two</p>
<p><strong>wedge</strong>: Activate harpoon.</p>
<p><strong>wedge</strong>: Good shot, Janson.</p>
<p><strong>wedge</strong>: One more pass.</p>
<p><strong>janson</strong>: Coming around. Once more.</p>
<p><strong>janson</strong>: Once more.</p>
<p><strong>janson</strong>: Cable out! Let her go!</p>
<p><strong>wedge</strong>: Detach cable.</p>
<p><strong>janson</strong>: Cable detached.</p>
<p><strong>trench officer</strong>: Come on!</p>
<p><strong>wedge</strong>: Whooha! That got him!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I see it, Wedge. Good work.</p>
<p><strong>rieekan</strong>: I don’t think we can protect two transports
at a time.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: It’s risky, but we can’t hold out much longer.
We have no choice.</p>
<p><strong>rieekan</strong>: Launch patrols.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Evacuate remaining ground staff.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: No, no! No! This one goes there, that one goes
there. Right?</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Artoo, you take good care of Master Luke
now, understand? And … do take good care of yourself. Oh, dear, oh,
dear.</p>
<p><strong>veers</strong>: All troops will debark for ground assault.
Prepare to target the main generator.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Rogue Two, are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>zev</strong>: Yeah. I’m with you, Rogue Leader.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: We’ll set harpoon. I’ll cover for you.</p>
<p><strong>zev</strong>: Coming around.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Watch that cross fire, boys.</p>
<p><strong>zev</strong>: Set for position three. Steady.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Stay tight and low.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Hobbie, I’ve been hit!</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: You all right?</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Why are you still here?</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: I heard the command center had been hit.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: You got your clearance to leave.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Don’t worry. I’ll leave. First I’m going to get
you to your ship.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Your Highness, we must take this last
transport. It’s our only hope.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Send all troops in sector twelve to the south
slope to protect the fighters.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Imperial troops have entered the
base.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Come on… that’s it.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Give the evacuation code signal. And get to
your transports!</p>
<p><strong>head controller</strong>: K-one-zero… all troops
disengage.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Oh! Wait for me!</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Begin retreat!</p>
<p><strong>second officer</strong>: Fall back!</p>
<p><strong>veers</strong>: Distance to power generators?</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: One-seven, decimal two-eight.</p>
<p><strong>veers</strong>: Target. Maximum fire power.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Transport, this is Solo. Better take off - I
can’t get to you. I’ll get the princess out on the Falcon.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: But… but… but… where are you going? Uh…
come back!!</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Wait! Wait for me! Wait! Stop!</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: How typical.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Hurry up, goldenrod, or you’re going to be a
permanent resident!</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Wait! Wait!</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: How’s this?</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Would it helped if I got out and pushed?</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: It might.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Captain Solo, Captain Solo… sir, might I
suggest that you…</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: It can wait.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: This bucket of bolts is never going to get us
past that blockade.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: This baby’s got a few surprises left in her,
sweetheart.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Come on! Come on! Switch over. Let’s hope we
don’t have a burnout.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: See?</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Someday you’re going to be wrong, and I hope
I’m there to see it.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Punch it!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Artoo! Get her ready for takeoff.</p>
<p><strong>wedge</strong>: Good luck, Luke. See you at the
rendezvous.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Don’t worry, Artoo. We’re going, we’re
going.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: There’s nothing wrong, Artoo. I’m just setting
a new course.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: We’re not going to regroup with the
others.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: We’re going to the Dagobah system.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Yes, Artoo?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: That’s all right. I’d like to keep it on
manual control for a while.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: I saw them! I saw them!</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Saw what?</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Star Destroyers, two of them, coming right at
us.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Sir, sir! Might I suggest…</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Shut him up or shut him down! Check the
deflector shield!</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Oh, great. Well, we can still outmaneuver
them.</p>
<p><strong>int. star destroyer - bridge</strong>: Out the front window,
the two approaching Star Destroyers can be seen veering to the left.</p>
<p><strong>imperial officer</strong>: Take evasive action!</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Prepare to make the jump to light- speed.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: But, sir!</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: They’re getting closer!</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Oh yeah? Watch this.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Watch what?</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: I think we’re in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: If I may say so, sir, I noticed earlier
that the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged. It’s impossible to go to
light-speed!</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: We’re in trouble!</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Horizontal boosters…! Alluvial dampers…! Well
that’s not it. Bring me the hydrospanners!</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: I don’t know how we’re going to get out of this
one.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Oww! Chewie!</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: That was no laser blast! Something hit us.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Han, get up here!</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Come on, Chewie!</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Asteroids!</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Oh, no! Chewie, set two-seven- one.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: What are you doing? You’re not actually going
into an asteroid field?</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: They’d be crazy to follow us, wouldn’t
they?</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: You don’t have to do this to impress me.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Sir, the possibility of successfully
navigating an asteroid field is approximately three thousand, seven
hundred and twenty to one.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Never tell me the odds!</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: You said you wanted to be around when I made a
mistake; well, this could be it, sweetheart.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: I take it back. We’re going to get pulverized
if we stay out here much longer.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: I’m not going to argue with that.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Pulverized?</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: I’m going in closer to one of those big
ones.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Closer?</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Closer?!</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Oh, this is suicide!</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: There. That looks pretty good.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: What looks pretty good?</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Yeah. That’ll do nicely.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Excuse me, ma’am, but where are we
going?</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: I hope you know what you’re doing.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Yeah, me too.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Yes, that’s it. Dagobah.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: No, I’m not going to change my mind about
this. I’m not picking up any cities or technology. Massive life-form
readings, though. There’s something alive down there…</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Yes, I’m sure it’s perfectly safe for
droids.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I know, I know! All the scopes are dead. I
can’t see a thing! Just hang on, I’m going to start the landing
cycle…</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: No, Artoo, you stay put. I’ll have a look
around.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Artoo?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Artoo! Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Artoo! You be more careful.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Artoo - that way!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Artoo!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Oh, no! Are you all right? Come on. You’re
lucky you don’t taste very good. Anything broken?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: If you’re saying coming here was a bad idea,
I’m beginning to agree with you. Oh, Artoo, what are we doing here? It’s
like… something out of a dream, or, I don’t know. Maybe I’m just going
crazy.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: Yes, Admiral?</p>
<p><strong>piett</strong>: Our ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon,
lord. But… it has entered an asteroid field and we cannot risk…</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: Asteroids do not concern me, Admiral. I want
that ship and not excuses.</p>
<p><strong>piett</strong>: Yes, lord.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: I’m going to shut down everything but the
emergency power systems.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Sir, I’m almost afraid to ask, but… does
that include shutting me down, too?</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: No, I need you to talk to the Falcon, find out
what’s wrong with the hyperdrive.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Sir, it’s quite possible this asteroid is
not entirely stable.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Not entirely stable? I’m glad you’re here to
tell us these things. Chewie, take the professor in the back and plug
him into the hyperdrive.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Oh! Sometimes I just don’t understand
human behavior. After all, I’m only trying to do my job in the most…</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Let go.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Sshh!</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Let go, please.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Don’t get excited.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Captain, being held by you isn’t quite enough
to get me excited.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Sorry, sweetheart. We haven’t got time for
anything else.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Ready for some power? Okay. Let’s see now. Put
that in there. There you go.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Now all I have to do is find this Yoda… if he
even exists.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Still… there’s something familiar about this
place. I feel like… I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>strange voice</strong>: Feel like what?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Like we’re being watched!</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: Away with your weapon! I mean you no
harm.</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: I am wondering, why are you here?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I’m looking for someone.</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: Looking? Found someone, you have, I would
say, hmmm?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: Help you I can. Yes, mmmm.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I don’t think so. I’m looking for a great
warrior.</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: Ahhh! A great warrior. Wars not make one
great.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Put that down. Hey! That’s my dinner!</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: How you get so big, eating food of this
kind?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Listen, friend, we didn’t mean to land in that
puddle, and if we could get our ship out, we would, but we can’t, so why
don’t you just…</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: Aww, cannot get your ship out?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Hey, you could have broken this. Don’t do
that. Ohhh… you’re making a mess. Hey, give me that!</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: Mine! Or I will help you not.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I don’t want your help. I want my lamp back.
I’ll need it to get out of this slimy mudhole.</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: Mudhole? Slimy? My home this is.</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: Ah, ah, ah!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Oh, Artoo, let him have it!</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: Mine! Mine!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Artoo!</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: Mine!</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: Mine!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Now will you move along, little fella? We’re
got a lot of work to do.</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: No! No, no! Stay and help you, I will.
Find your friend, hmm?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I’m not looking for a friend. I’m looking for
a Jedi Master.</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: Oohhh. Jedi Master. Yoda. You seek
Yoda.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: You know him?</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: Mmm. Take you to him, I will. Yes, yes.
But now, we must eat. Come. Good food. Come.</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: Come, come.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Stay here and watch after the camp, Artoo.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Oh, where is Artoo when I need him?</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Sir, I don’t know where your ship learned
to communicate, but it has the most peculiar dialect. I believe, sir, it
says that the power coupling on the negative axis has been polarized.
I’m afraid you’ll have to replace it.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Well, of course I’ll have to replace it.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Here! And Chewie…</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: … I think we’d better replace the negative
power coupling.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Hey, Your Worship, I’m only trying to help.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Would you please stop calling me that?</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Sure, Leia.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Oh, you make it so difficult sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: I do, I really do. You could be a little nicer,
though. Come on, admit it. Sometimes you think I’m all right.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Occasionally… … when you aren’t acting like a
scoundrel.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Scoundrel? Scoundrel? I like the sound of
that.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Stop that.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Stop what?</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Stop that! My hands are dirty.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: My hands are dirty, too. What are you afraid
of?</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Afraid?</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: You’re trembling.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: I’m not trembling.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: You like me because I’m a scoundrel. There
aren’t enough scoundrels in your life.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: I happen to like nice men.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: I’m a nice man.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: No, you’re not. You’re…</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Sir, sir! I’ve isolated the reverse power
flux coupling.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Thank you. Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Oh, you’re perfectly welcome, sir.</p>
<p><strong>needa</strong>: … and that, Lord Vader, was the last time
they appeared in any of our scopes. Considering the amount of damage
we’ve sustained, they must have been destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: No, Captain, they’re alive. I want every ship
available to sweep the asteroid field until they are found.</p>
<p><strong>piett</strong>: Lord Vader.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: Yes, Admiral, what is it?</p>
<p><strong>piett</strong>: The Emperor commands you make contact with
him.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: Move the ship out of the asteroid field so
that we can send a clear transmission.</p>
<p><strong>piett</strong>: Yes, my lord.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: What is thy bidding, my master?</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: There is a great disturbance in the
Force.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: I have felt it.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: We have a new enemy - Luke Skywalker.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: Yes, my master.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: He could destroy us.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: He’s just a boy. Obi-Wan can no longer help
him.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: The Force is strong with him. The son of
Skywalker must not become a Jedi.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: If he could be turned, he would become a
powerful ally.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: Yes. Yes. He would be a great asset. Can it
be done?</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: He will join us or die, my master.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Look, I’m sure it’s delicious. I just don’t
understand why we can’t see Yoda now.</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: Patience! For the Jedi it is time to eat
as well. Eat, eat. Hot. Good food, hm? Good, hmm?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: How far away is Yoda? Will it take us long to
get there?</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: Not far. Yoda not far. Patience. Soon you
will be with him. Rootleaf, I cook. Why wish you become Jedi? Hm?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Mostly because of my father, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: Ah, your father. Powerful Jedi was he,
powerful Jedi, mmm.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Oh, come on. How could you know my father? You
don’t even know who I am. Oh, I don’t know what I’m doing here. We’re
wasting our time.</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: I cannot teach him. The boy has no
patience.</p>
<p><strong>ben’s voice</strong>: He will learn patience.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Hmmm. Much anger in him, like his father.</p>
<p><strong>ben’s voice</strong>: Was I any different when you taught
me?</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Hah. He is not ready.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Yoda! I am ready. I… Ben! I can be a Jedi.
Ben, tell him I’m ready.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Ready, are you? What know you of ready? For
eight hundred years have I trained Jedi. My own counsel will I keep on
who is to be trained! A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most
serious mind. This one a long time have I watched. All his life has he
looked away… to the future, to the horizon. Never his mind on where he
was. Hmm? What he was doing. Hmph. Adventure. Heh! Excitement. Heh! A
Jedi craves not these things. You are reckless!</p>
<p><strong>ben’s voice</strong>: So was I, if you’ll remember.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: He is too old. Yes, too old to begin the
training.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: But I’ve learned so much.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Will he finished what he begins?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I won’t fail you - I’m not afraid.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Oh, you will be. You will be.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Sir, if I may venture an opinion…</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: I’m not really interested in your opinion,
Threepio.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: There’s something out there.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Outside, in the cave.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: There it is. Listen! Listen!</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: I’m going out there.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Are you crazy?!</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: I just got this bucket back together. I’m not
going to let something tear it apart.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Then I’m going with you.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: I think it might be better if I stay here
and guard the ship. Oh, no.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: This ground sure feels strange. It doesn’t
feel like rock at all.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: There’s an awful lot of moisture in here.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: I don’t know. I have a bad feeling about
this.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Watch out!</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Yeah, that’s what I thought. Mynock. Chewie,
check the rest of the ship, make sure there aren’t any more attached.
They’re chewing on the power cables.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Mynocks?</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Go on inside. We’ll clean them off if there are
any more.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Ohhh! Go away! Go away! Beastly little
thing. Shoo! Shoo!</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Wait a minute…</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: All right, Chewie, let’s get out of here!</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: The Empire is still out there. I don’t think
it’s wise to…</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: No time to discuss this in committee.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: I am not a committee!</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: You can’t make the jump to light- speed in
this asteroid field…</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Sit down, sweetheart. We’re taking off!</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Look!</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: I see it, I see it.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: We’re doomed!</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: The cave is collapsing.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: This is no cave.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Run! Yes. A Jedi’s strength flows from the
Force. But beware of the dark side. Anger… fear… aggression. The dark
side of the Force are they. Easily they flow, quick to join you in a
fight. If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate
your destiny, consume you it will, as it did Obi-Wan’s apprentice.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Vader. Is the dark side stronger?</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: No… no… no. Quicker, easier, more
seductive.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: But how am I to know the good side from the
bad?</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: You will know. When you are calm, at peace.
Passive. A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense, never for
attack.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: But tell me why I can’t…</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: No, no, there is no why. Nothing more will I
teach you today. Clear your mind of questions. Mmm. Mmmmmmmm.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: There’s something not right here.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I feel cold, death.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: That place… is strong with the dark side of
the Force. A domain of evil it is. In you must go.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: What’s in there?</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Only what you take with you.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Your weapons… you will not need them.</p>
<p><strong>piett</strong>: Bounty hunters. We don’t need that scum.</p>
<p><strong>first controller</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>piett</strong>: Those Rebels won’t escape us.</p>
<p><strong>second controller</strong>: Sir, we have a priority signal
from the Star Destroyer Avenger.</p>
<p><strong>piett</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: … there will be a substantial reward for the
one who finds the Millennium Falcon. You are free to use any methods
necessary, but I want them alive. No disintegrations.</p>
<p><strong>boba fett</strong>: As you wish.</p>
<p><strong>piett</strong>: Lord Vader! My lord, we have them.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Oh, thank goodness we’re coming out of the
asteroid field.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Let’s get out of here. Ready for light-speed?
One… two… three!</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: It’s not fair!</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: The transfer circuits are working. It’s not my
fault!</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: No light-speed?</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: It’s not my fault.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Sir, we just lost the main rear deflector
shield. One more direct hit on the back quarter and we’re done for.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Turn her around.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: I said turn her around! I’m going to put all
power in the front shield.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: You’re going to attack them?!</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Sir, the odds of surviving a direct
assault on an Imperial Star Destroyer…</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>needa</strong>: They’re moving to attack position! Shields
up!</p>
<p><strong>needa</strong>: Track them. They may come around for another
pass.</p>
<p><strong>tracking officer</strong>: Captain Needa, the ship no longer
appears on our scopes.</p>
<p><strong>needa</strong>: They can’t have disappeared. No ship that
small has a cloaking device.</p>
<p><strong>tracking officer</strong>: Well, there’s no trace of them,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>communications officer</strong>: Captain, Lord Vader demands
an update on the pursuit.</p>
<p><strong>needa</strong>: Get a shuttle ready. I shall assume full
responsibility for losing them, and apologize to Lord Vader. Meanwhile,
continue to scan the area.</p>
<p><strong>communications officer</strong>: Yes, Captain Needa.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Use the Force. Yes…</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Now… the stone. Feel it.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Concentrate!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Oh, no. We’ll never get it out now.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: So certain are you. Always with you it cannot
be done. Hear you nothing that I say?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Master, moving stones around is one thing.
This is totally different.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: No! No different! Only different in your mind.
You must unlearn what you have learned.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: All right, I’ll give it a try.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: No! Try not. Do. Or do not. There is no
try.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I can’t. It’s too big.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Size matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my
size, do you? Hm? Mmmm.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: And well you should not. For my ally in the
Force. And a powerful ally it is. Life creates it, makes it grow. Its
energy surrounds us and binds us. Luminous beings are we… … not this
crude matter. You must feel the Force around you. Here, between you… me…
the tree… the rock… everywhere! Yes, even between this land and that
ship!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: You want the impossible.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I don’t… I don’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: That is why you fail.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: Apology accepted, Captain Needa.</p>
<p><strong>piett</strong>: Lord Vader, our ships have completed their
scan of the area and found nothing. If the Millennium Falcon went into
light- speed, it’ll be on the other side of the galaxy by now.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: Alert all commands. Calculate every possible
destination along their last know trajectory.</p>
<p><strong>piett</strong>: Yes, my lord. We’ll find them.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: Don’t fail me again, Admiral.</p>
<p><strong>piett</strong>: Alert all commands. Deploy the fleet.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Captain Solo, this time you have gone too
far. No, I will not be quiet, Chewbacca. Why doesn’t anyone listen to
me?</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: The fleet is beginning to break up. Go back and
stand by the manual release for the landing claw.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: I really don’t see how that is going to
help. Surrender is a perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme
circumstances. The Empire may be gracious enough…</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: What did you have in mind for your next
move?</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Well, if they follow standard Imperial
procedure, they’ll dump their garbage before they go to light-speed,
then we just float away.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: With the rest of the garbage. Then what?</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Then we’ve got to find a safe port somewhere
around here. Got any ideas?</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: No. Where are we?</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: The Anoat system.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Anoat system. There’s not much there.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: No. Well, wait. This is interesting. Lando.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Lando system?</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Lando’s not a system, he’s a man. Lando
Calrissian. He’s a card player, gambler, scoundrel. You’d like him.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Bespin. It’s pretty far, but I think we can
make it.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: A mining colony?</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine. Lando conned somebody
out of it. We go back a long way, Lando and me.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Can you trust him?</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: No. But he has no love for the Empire, I can
tell you that.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Here we go, Chewie. Stand by. Detach!</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: You do have your moments. Not many, but you
have them.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Concentrate… feel the Force flow. Yes. Good.
Calm, yes. Through the Force, things you will see. Other places. The
future… the past. Old friends long gone.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Han! Leia!</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Hmm. Control, control. You must learn
control.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I saw… I saw a city in the clouds.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Mmm. Friends you have there.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: They were in pain.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: It is the future you see.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Future? Will they die?</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Difficult to see. Always in motion is the
future.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I’ve got to go to them.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Decide you must how to serve them best. If you
leave now, help them you could. But you would destroy all for which they
have fought and suffered.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: No, I don’t have a landing permit. I’m trying
to reach Lando Calrissian.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Whoa! Wait a minute! Let me explain.</p>
<p><strong>intercom voice</strong>: You will not deviate from your
present course.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Rather touchy, aren’t they?</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: I thought you knew this person.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Well, that was a long time ago. I’m sure he’s
forgotten about that.</p>
<p><strong>intercom voice</strong>: Permission granted to land on
Platform Three-two-seven.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: There’s nothing to worry about. We go way back,
Lando and me.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Who’s worried?</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Oh. No one to meet us.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: I don’t like this.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Well, what would you like?</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Well, they did let us land.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Look, don’t worry. Everything’s going to be
fine. Trust me.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: See? My friend. Keep your eyes open, okay?</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: Why, you slimy, double-crossing, no-good
swindler! You’ve got a lot of guts coming here, after what you
pulled.</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: How you doing, you old pirate? So good to see
you! I never thought I’d catch up with you again. Where you been?</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Well, he seems very friendly.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Yes… very friendly.</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Ahh… repairs. I thought you could help me
out.</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: What have you done to my ship?</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Your ship? Hey, remember, you lost her to me
fair and square.</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: Hello. What have we here? Welcome. I’m Lando
Calrissian. I’m the administrator of this facility. And who might you
be?</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Leia.</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: Welcome, Leia.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: All right, all right, you old smoothie.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Hello, sir. I am See-Threepio,
human-cyborg relations. My facilities are at your…</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Well, really!</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: What’s wrong with the Falcon?</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Hyperdrive.</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: I’ll get my people to work on it.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: You know, that ship saved my life quite a few
times. She’s the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: How’s the gas mine? Is it paying off for
you?</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: Oh, not as well as I’d like. We’re a small
outpost and not very self-sufficient. And I’ve had supply problems of
every kind. I’ve had labor difficulties… What’s so funny?</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: You. Listen to you - you sound like a
businessman, a responsible leader. Who’d have thought that, huh?</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: You know, seeing you sure brings back a few
things.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: Yeah. I’m responsible these days. It’s the
price you pay for being successful.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Oh! Nice to see a familiar face.</p>
<p><strong>second threepio</strong>: E chu ta!</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: How rude!</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: That sounds like an R2 unit in there. I
wonder if…</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Hello? How interesting. Oh, my.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Oh, I’m terribly sorry. I… I didn’t mean
to intrude. No, no, please don’t get up. No!</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Luke! You must complete the training.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I can’t keep the vision out of my head.
They’re my friends. I’ve got to help them.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: You must not go!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: But Han and Leia will die if I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>ben’s voice</strong>: You don’t know that.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Even Yoda cannot see their fate.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: But I can help them! I feel the Force!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: But you cannot control it. This is a dangerous
time for you, when you will be tempted by the dark side of the
Force.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Yes, yes. To Obi-Wan you listen. The cave.
Remember your failure at the cave!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: But I’ve learned so much since then. Master
Yoda, I promise to return and finish what I’ve begun. You have my
word.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: It is you and your abilities the Emperor wants.
that is why your friends are made to suffer.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: And that is why I have to go.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Luke, I don’t want to lose you to the Emperor
the way I lost Vader.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: You won’t.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Stopped they must be. On this all depends.
Only a fully trained Jedi Knight with the Force as his ally will conquer
Vader and his Emperor. If you end your training now, if you choose the
quick and easy path, as Vader did, you will become an agent of evil.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Patience.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: And sacrifice Han and Leia?</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: If you honor what they fight for … yes!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: If you choose to face Vader, you will do it
alone. I cannot interfere.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I understand. Artoo, fire up the
converters.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Luke, don’t give in to hate - that leads to the
dark side.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Strong is Vader. Mind what you have learned.
Save you it can.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I will. And I’ll return. I promise.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Told you, I did. Reckless is he. Now matters
are worse.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: That boy is our last hope.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: No. There is another.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: The ship is almost finished. Two or Three more
things and we’re in great shape.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: The sooner the better. Something’s wrong here.
No one has seen or knows anything about Threepio. He’s been gone too
long to have gotten lost.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Relax. I’ll talk to Lando and see what I can
find out.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: I don’t trust Lando.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Well, I don’t trust him, either. But he is my
friend. Besides, we’ll soon be gone.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: And then you’re as good as gone, aren’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Where? Found him in a junk pile?</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Oh, what a mess. Chewie, do you think you can
repair him?</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Lando’s got people who can fix him.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: No, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: I’m sorry. Am I interrupting anything?</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Not really.</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: You look absolutely beautiful. You truly
belong here with us among the clouds.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: Will you join me for a little
refreshment?</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: Everyone’s invited, of course.</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: Having trouble with you droid?</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: No. No problem. Why?</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: So you see, since we’re a small operation, we
don’t fall into the… uh… jurisdiction of the Empire.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: So you’re part of the mining guild then?</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: No, not actually. Our operation is small
enough not to be noticed… which is advantageous for everybody since our
customers are anxious to avoid attracting attention to themselves.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Aren’t you afraid the Empire’s going to find
out about this little operation and shut you down?</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: That’s always been a danger looming like a
shadow over everything we’ve built here. But things have developed that
will insure security. I’ve just made a deal that will keep the Empire
out of here forever.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: We would be honored if you would join us.</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: I had no choice. They arrived right before
you did. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: I’m sorry, too.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: No, Threepio’s with them.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Just hang on. We’re almost there.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Mmmm. Oh, my. Uh, I, uh - Take this off!
I, uh, don’t mean to intrude here. I, don’t, no, no, no… Please don’t
get up. No!</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Stormtroopers? Here? We’re in danger. I
must tell the others. Oh, no! I’ve been shot!</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: Lord Vader.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: You may take Captain Solo to Jabba the Hut
after I have Skywalker.</p>
<p><strong>boba fett</strong>: He’s no good to me dead.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: He will not be permanently damaged.</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: Lord Vader, what about Leia and the
Wookiee?</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: They must never again leave this city.</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: That was never a condition of our agreement,
nor was giving Han to this bounty hunter!</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: Perhaps you think you’re being treated
unfairly.</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: Good. It would be unfortunate if I had to
leave a garrison here.</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: This deal’s getting worse all the time.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Oh, yes, that’s very good. I like that.
Oh! Something’s not right because now I can’t see. Wait. Wait! Oh, my!
what have you done? I’m backwards, you stupid furball. Only an overgrown
mophead like you would be stupid enough…</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: I feel terrible.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Why are they doing this?</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: They never even asked me any questions.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Lando.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Get out of here, Lando!</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: Shut up and listen! Vader has agreed to turn
Leia and Chewie over to me.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Over to you?</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: They’ll have to stay here, but at least
they’ll be safe.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: What about Han?</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: Vader’s giving him to the bounty hunter.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Vader wants us all dead.</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: He doesn’t want you at all. He’s after
somebody called Skywalker.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Luke?</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: Lord Vader has set a trap for him.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: And we’re the bait.</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: Well, he’s on his way.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Perfect. You fixed us all pretty good, didn’t
you? My friend!</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: Stop! I’ve done all I can. I’m sorry I
couldn’t do better, but I have my own problems.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Yeah, you’re a real hero.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: You certainly have a way with people.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: This facility is crude, but it should be
adequate to freeze Skywalker for his journey to the Emperor.</p>
<p><strong>imperial soldier</strong>: Lord Vader, ship approaching.
X-wing class.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: Good. Monitor Skywalker and allow him to
land.</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: Lord Vader, we only use this facility for
carbon freezing. If you put him in there, it might kill him.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: I do not want the Emperor’s prize damaged. We
will test it… on Captain Solo.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: If only you had attached my legs, I
wouldn’t be in this ridiculous position. Now, remember, Chewbacca, you
have a responsibility to me, so don’t do anything foolish.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: What’s going on… buddy?</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: You’re being put into carbon freeze.</p>
<p><strong>boba fett</strong>: What if he doesn’t survive? He’s worth a
lot to me.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: The Empire will compensate you if he dies.
Put him in!</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Oh, no! No, no, no! Stop, Chewbacca,
stop…!</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Stop, Chewie, stop! Do you hear me? Stop!</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Yes, stop, please! I’m not ready to
die.</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Chewie! Chewie, this won’t help me. Hey!</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: Save your strength. There’ll be another time.
The princess - you have to take care of her. You hear me?</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: I love you!</p>
<p><strong>han</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: What… what’s going on? Turn round,
Chewbacca, I can’t see. Oh… they’ve encased him in carbonite. He should
be quite well-protected - if he survives the freezing process, that
is.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: Well, Calrissian, did he survive?</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: Yes, he’s alive. And in perfect
hibernation.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: He’s all yours bounty hunter. Reset the
chamber for Skywalker.</p>
<p><strong>imperial officer</strong>: Skywalker has just landed, my
lord.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: Good. See to it that he finds his way here.
Calrissian, take the princess and the Wookiee to my ship.</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: You said they’d be left in the city under my
supervision.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: I am altering the deal. Pray I don’t alter it
any further.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Luke! Luke, don’t - it’s a trap! It’s a
trap!</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: The Force is with you, young Skywalker. But
you are not a Jedi yet.</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: Well done. Hold them in the security tower -
and keep it quiet. Move.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: What do you think you’re doing?</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: We’re getting out of here.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: I knew all along it had to be a
mistake.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Do you think that after what you did to Han
we’re going to trust you?</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: I had no choice…</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: What are you doing? Trust him, trust
him!</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Oh, so we understand, don’t we, Chewie? He had
no choice.</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: I’m just trying to help…</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: We don’t need any of your help.</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: H-a-a-a…</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: It sounds like Han.</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: There’s still a chance to save Han… I mean,
at the East Platform…</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Chewie.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: I’m terribly sorry about all this. After
all, he’s only a Wookiee.</p>
<p><strong>boba fett</strong>: Put Captain Solo in the cargo hold.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Artoo! Artoo! Where have you been?</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Turn around, you wooly…! Hurry, hurry!
We’re trying to save Han from the bounty hunter!</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Well, at least your still in one piece!
Look what happened to me!</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Oh, no! Chewie, they’re behind you!</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: You have learned much, young one.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: You’ll find I’m full of surprises.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: Your destiny lies with me, Skywalker. Obi-Wan
knew this to be true.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: All to easy. Perhaps you are not as strong as
the Emperor thought.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: Impressive… most impressive.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: Obi-Wan has taught you well. You have
controlled your fear… now release your anger.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: Only your hatred can destroy me.</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: The security codes has been changed!</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Artoo, you can tell the computer to
override the security system.</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: Attention! This is Lando Calrissian. The
Empire has takes control of the city. I advise everyone to leave before
more Imperial troops arrive.</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: This way.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Don’t blame me. I’m an interpreter. I’m
not supposed to know a power socket from a computer terminal.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: What are you talking about? We’re not
interested in the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon. It’s fixed! Just
open the door, you stupid lump.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: I never doubted you for a second.
Wonderful!</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Ouch! Oh! Ah! That hurt. Bend down, you
thoughtless… Ow!</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: Leia! Go!</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: I thought that hairy beast would be the
end of me. Of course, I’ve looked better.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: You are beaten. It is useless to resist.
Don’t let yourself be destroyed as Obi-Wan did.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: There is no escape. Don’t make me destroy
you. You do not yet realize your importance. You have only begun to
discover your power. Join me and I will complete your training. With our
combined strength, we can end this destructive conflict and bring order
to the galaxy.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I’ll never join you!</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: If you only knew the power of the dark side.
Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: He told me enough! It was you who killed
him.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: No. I am your father.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: No. No. That’s not true! That’s
impossible!</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: Search your feelings. You know it to be
true.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: No! No! No!</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: Luke. You can destroy the Emperor. He has
foreseen this. It is your destiny. Join me, and together we can rule the
galaxy as father and son. Come with me. It is the only way.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Ben… Ben, please!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Ben. Leia!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Hear me! Leia!</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Luke… We’ve got to go back.</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: I know where Luke is.</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: But what about those fighter?</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Chewie, just do it.</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: But what about Vader?</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: All right, all right, all right.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: Bring my shuttle.</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: Look, someone’s up there.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: It’s Luke. Chewie, slow down. Slow down and
we’ll get under him. Lando, open the top hatch.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Okay. Easy, Chewie.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Lando?</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: Okay, let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Oh, Leia.</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: All right, Chewie. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: I’ll be back.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: Star Destroyer.</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: All right, Chewie. Ready for light-speed.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: If your people fixed the hyperdrive.</p>
<p><strong>leia</strong>: All the coordinates are set. It’s now or
never.</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: Punch it!</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: They told me they fixed it. I trusted them to
fix it. It’s not my fault!</p>
<p><strong>piett</strong>: They’ll be in range of our tractor beam in
moments, my lord.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: Did your men deactivate the hyperdrive on the
Millennium Falcon?</p>
<p><strong>piett</strong>: Yes, my lord.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: Good. Prepare the boarding party and set your
weapons for stun.</p>
<p><strong>piett</strong>: Yes, my lord.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Noisy brute. Why don’t we just go into
light-speed?</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: We can’t? How would you know the
hyperdrive is deactivated?</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: The city’s central computer told you?
Artoo-Detoo, you know better than to trust a strange computer. Ouch! Pay
attention to what you’re doing!</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: Luke.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Father.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: Son, come with me.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Ben, why didn’t you tell me?</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: Chewie!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: It’s Vader.</p>
<p><strong>vader</strong>: Luke… it is your destiny.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Ben, why didn’t you tell me?</p>
<p><strong>piett</strong>: Alert all commands. Ready for the tractor
beam.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Artoo, come back at once! You haven’t
finished with me yet! You don’t know how to fix the hyperdrive.
Chewbacca can do it. I’m standing here in pieces, and you’re having
delusions of grandeur!</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Oh, you did it!</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: Luke, we’re ready for takeoff.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Good luck, Lando</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: When we find Jabba the Hut and that bounty
hunter, we’ll contact you.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I’ll meet you at the rendezvous point on
Tatooine.</p>
<p><strong>lando</strong>: Princess, we’ll find Han. I promise.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Chewie, I’ll be waiting for your signal.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Take care, you two. May the Force be with
you.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Ow!</p>
