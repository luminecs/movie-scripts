<p><strong>ames</strong>: It won’t hold, Ronnie, it won’t prove out.</p>
<p><strong>brean</strong>: We don’t need it to prove out. We need it to
distract them for two weeks til the election.</p>
<p><strong>ames</strong>: What would do that…?</p>
<p>****: What in the world would do that?</p>

<p>****: Lookit, don’t worry about it. It’s not a New Concept. Wake me
when we touch down, will…</p>
<p><strong>ames</strong>: We can’t afford a war.</p>
<p><strong>brean</strong>: We aren’t going to have a war. We’re going to
have the “appearance” of a war.</p>
<p><strong>ames</strong>: I’m not sure we can afford to have the
“appearance” of a war.</p>
<p><strong>brean</strong>: What’s it gonna cost?</p>

this election, you better change the subject. You wanna change this
subject, you better have a War. What do you need? It’s gotta be quick,
it’s gotta be dramatic, you got to have an enemy. Okay? What do you need

<p><strong>senator nole</strong>: Especially in a time of war. Now: We
said that Moral fibre, not guns, not supplies, not strategy, Moral…</p>
<p>****: …Senator…?</p>
<p><strong>senator nole</strong>: And this man, our President, in what I
hope will be his last days in that office, has proved himself empty and
devoid of…</p>
<p>****: Can’t find anything in here about the President and that

<p><strong>ames</strong>: Is she saying this in Albanian…?</p>
<p>****: Yes: she is saying this in Albanian, but she’s doing it not to
be uh…</p>
<p>****: But because, she explains, that is the only way it can be
understood by her Aged and Sainted Mother, who is standing there with
her, dressed in her Traditional…</p>
<p>****: C’n I get something to eat…? Now the Old Broad starts to speak:
you are bringing peace. Not only to This Land…</p>
<p><strong>ames</strong>: Our adopted land…</p>
<p><strong>brean</strong>: …but to the Old World; you are stilling the
forces of hatred and of War which have, since I was a child…</p>
<p><strong>ames</strong>: …uh huh…</p>
<p><strong>brean</strong>: Now, the Old Lady starts to Weep, Big Bird
shrugs off his secret Service, goes to her, and covers her with his own
coat.</p>
<p>****: Find out is there any chance we can get some rain tomorrow,
will you…?</p>
<p>****: So forth…</p>
<p><strong>young mother one</strong>: …to vote for.</p>

<p><strong>ames</strong>: You’re tired, Ronnie.</p>
<p><strong>brean</strong>: Y’wanna follow the Cattle Drive? Sleep in the
Winter. What does Moss want…? Matchmaker comes to the Levinsky Family.
Mr. Levinsky, Mrs. Levinsky, would you entertain an offer of marriage
for your son Saul, from Princess Margaret of Great Britain. Well, they
think, she isn’t Jewish, but she’s well to-do, a nice old family.
Alright, yes, they say. We would consider such an offer. Wonderful,
matchmaker says, My Job is Half Done.</p>
<p>****: Now, Look: I got the file, from the L.A. contingent, I got the
day-by-day, of how…</p>
<p>****: …denial from the Albanian Government continues, but this tape,
just in…</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: …just having heard her family shot. For
the crime of non-cooperation with Albanian Authorities. Apparently, they
had a family connection in Canada, along the US border and refused to
exploit it to aid the Terrorists to infiltrate this country.</p>
<p>****: They paid with their lives.</p>
<p><strong>ames</strong>: …this is magnificent.</p>

it, what Is war…? What is war? I mean, aside from the killing, and, all…
that isn’t so pleasant, … you in the Service…?</p>
<p>****: …and I’ll tell you another thing. President said to me: When
this thing… “happened.” “It looks like the Building’s falling. But,
these are the times…” and I wish what he said, we could have used it on
TV, and, as a matter of fact, we can, if we…</p>
<p>****: Look here, here’s an idea… Here’s an idea…</p>
<p>****: Turn it on it’s head. If we’re ahead in the polls, well, hell,
this is the time to capitalize on it. What do you think? Get ahead of
them, use the percentage points to push forward some of the long-term
goals: housing, health-care ref…</p>
<p><strong>yalie</strong>: Who might be the Boss Hog in this
operation?</p>
<p><strong>brean</strong>: Feel free to talk to me.</p>
<p><strong>yalie</strong>: Cheezit-the-Cops.</p>
<p>****: Ohmigod…</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: …awaiting the arrival of The President
back on American Soil. To still the fears, to answer the questions of
this troubled land. Here, along a border once considered more Imaginary
than real, I’m Mike Stears, at latitude 45, along the Canadian
Border.</p>
<p><strong>brean</strong>: …I just missed my plane.</p>
<p><strong>ames</strong>: You missed your plane? My life is over.</p>
<p>****: My life is over. What have you done to me? What have I
done?</p>
<p>****: Fourteen years of Public Service…</p>
<p><strong>brean</strong>: Well, keep your wits about you, and let’s see
if we can’t…</p>
<p><strong>ames</strong>: …fourteen years…</p>
<p><strong>brean</strong>: …brazen-it-through…</p>
<p><strong>ames</strong>: Brazen it through? Brazen it through? They’re
going to hang us out to dry like the laundry — do you know what we’ve

<p><strong>bodyguard</strong>: No talking, please.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: With seven days to go before the election,
the Fortunes of President…</p>
<p>****: …took you long enough.</p>
<p><strong>yalie</strong>: Found’em as quick as we could, sir.</p>
<p><strong>mr. young</strong>: When I’m done with’em, we want to dump’em
in the District, or stick’em out in the country, have the F.B.I. trip
over’em?</p>
<p><strong>yalie</strong>: Legal department says You Pick Em. Depends on
how big of a splash you want to make, how long you want them to Go Away
for.</p>
<p>****: Oh, MiGod.</p>
<p><strong>mr. young</strong>: Guess who I am.</p>
<p><strong>ames</strong>: I’d like to mention a few names, who…</p>
<p>****: I know who you are, Mr. Ames.</p>
<p><strong>ames</strong>: I was acting as a Private Citizen. Nothing
that I’ve done should be construed as reflecting on the orders or
intentions of anyone with whom you may have reason to believe I am
connected with.</p>
<p>****: Or in whose employ…</p>
<p><strong>mr. young</strong>: Quite touching.</p>
<p><strong>ames</strong>: And I take this opportunity to suggest that,
equally, I admit to nothing, and that I would like my lawyer
present.</p>
<p><strong>mr. young</strong>: Guess what? We show, and N.S.A. confirms,
there are no nuclear devices on the Canadian border.</p>
<p>****: There are no nuclear devices in Albania. Z’at put us in
something of a pickle?</p>
<p>****: Albania has no nuclear capacity. Our spy satellites show “no
secret terrorist camps” in The Albanian Hinterland. The F.B.I. and the
Border Patrol, And the R.C.M.P. report no repeat no untoward activity
along our picturesque Canadian Border. The Albanian Government is
screaming its innocence, the world is listening.</p>
<p>****: There is no War.</p>
<p>****: Course there’s a war. I’m watching it on Television.</p>
<p><strong>mr. young</strong>: N’who might you be, when all’s said and
done?</p>
<p><strong>brean</strong>: My name is Ronald Brean.</p>
<p><strong>mr. young</strong>: Who’re you working for?</p>
<p><strong>brean</strong>: Nobody whose name you want me to say,
Mr. Young, I promise you.</p>
<p><strong>mr. young</strong>: S’all very well, but when the Fit hits
the Shan, somebody’s going to have to Stay After School, and who do you
’spose that might be.</p>
<p><strong>brean</strong>: S’only got to hold for another few days.</p>
<p><strong>mr. young</strong>: Well, I’m not interested in how long its
“got to hold for.”</p>
<p><strong>brean</strong>: What are you interested in?</p>
<p><strong>mr. young</strong>: I’m interested in the Security of My
Country, Mr. Brean.</p>
<p><strong>ames</strong>: As are we all, and I’d like to take this
opportunity to suggest that the Security of the country would be ill-
served by any, any…any…</p>
<p>****: Any untoward “revelation” regarding, uh…</p>
<p><strong>mr. young</strong>: And I think that the Security of the
Country would be best-served by its citizens obeying its laws.</p>
<p>****: Gemme a Federal Judge, gemme search-warrants, all premises
controlled by our friends, and bench-warrants for the two of…</p>
<p>****: Well, I’m sure that speaks very well of you and for your
parents. But if forced to choose between the security of the country and
the security of your Job, which would you pick. And, while you hesitate,
permit me to suggest that they are one and the same. Your country and
your job.</p>
<p><strong>mr. young</strong>: I’m doing my job, Mr. Brean. That’s what
you see me doing here. What is it you thought you were doing?</p>
<p><strong>ames</strong>: And I’d like to point out that I’ve been on
prescription medication, the side-effects of which…</p>
<p><strong>brean</strong>: I’m doing my job, Too.</p>
<p>****: Would you give me a… do you think you could call off your Dogs
for a minute.</p>
<p>****: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>mr. young</strong>: What’s on your mind?</p>
<p><strong>brean</strong>: I have a question for you.</p>
<p><strong>mr. young</strong>: Ask it.</p>
<p><strong>brean</strong>: Why do people go to war?</p>
<p><strong>mr. young</strong>: Why do people go to war?</p>
<p><strong>mr. young</strong>: I’ll play your silly game.</p>
<p><strong>brean</strong>: Why do they go to War?</p>
<p><strong>mr. young</strong>: To preserve their Way of Life.</p>
<p><strong>brean</strong>: Would you go to War to do that?</p>
<p><strong>mr. young</strong>: I have.</p>
<p><strong>brean</strong>: Well, I have, too. Would you do it again…?
In’t that why you’re here? I guess so. N’if you go to war again, who is
it going to be against? Your “ability to fight a Two-ocean War” against
who? Sweden and Togo? Who you sitting here to Go To War Against? That
time has passed. It’s passed. It’s over. The War of the Future is
Nuclear Terrorism. It is and it will be against a Small Group of
Dissidents who, unbeknownst, perhaps, to their own governments, have
blah blah blah. And to go to that war, you’ve got to be prepared. You
have to be alert, and the public has to be alert. Cause that is the war
of the future, and if you’re not gearing up, to fight that war,
eventually the axe will fall. N’you’re gonna be out in the street.</p>
<p>****: And you can call this a “drill,” or you can call it “job
security,” or you can call it anything you like. But I got one for you:
you said, “Go to War to protect your Way of Life,” well, Chuck, this</p>
<p>****: is your way of life. Innit? And if there ain’t no war, you can
punch out, go home, and take up Oil Painting. And there ain’t no war but
ours.</p>
<p>****: It’s just for eight more days…..</p>
<p>****: One more thing, what is that river she’s running across?</p>
<p><strong>yalie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>brean</strong>: …the young girl in the video, the Albanian
Girl….</p>
<p><strong>brean</strong>: …she’s running, it’s some sacred… some
ancestral land, cloven by the Brook named…. give it to Moss,</p>
<p><strong>young</strong>: No, we’re on top of it.</p>
<p><strong>brean</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>young</strong>: No, thank you…</p>
<p>****: I should be in Nashville, tell him I’m coming in.</p>
<p>****: Nice enogh people… they just hadn’t thought it through…</p>
<p>****: No. I was busy.</p>

easy….</p>
<p>****: …they just hadn’t thought it through…</p>
<p>****: Midst repeated denial from the Albanian Government. While, at
the White House, a sense of Stillness pervades, awaiting the return
of…</p>
<p><strong>cowboy</strong>: It ain’t hoarding. It’s stockpiling.</p>
<p><strong>brean</strong>: Uh huh.</p>
<p><strong>cowboy</strong>: Only common sense.</p>
<p>****: We got the guy, we got the guy, we got the Guy!</p>
<p><strong>fad king</strong>: The Canada Thing was a shuck. A shuck –

<p>****: Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, get this typed, get somebody to send it to
the White House…</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>brean</strong>: President’s speech.</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: At the Airport? Cause we decided at the
Airport he hugs the fat, wet Albanian Broad, we…</p>
<p><strong>brean</strong>: No, no, no, no, no after the airport.</p>
<p>****: Oh, shit…</p>
<p><strong>nole</strong>: …gotten word that the situation in Albania is
resolved. That it is resolved. My military sources confirm that our
troops, along the Canadian Border, And overseas are standing down, and I
must take this opportunity to call upon our President to stand and face
the charges, the heinous charges brought against him. You know, folks,
there is nothing in life as precious as the Innocence of a Child.</p>
<p>****: Nothing. Now, I do not say these charges are true, I do not see
how they could be. Accusations of, of sexual misconduct in anyone, must
be investigated. In the case of a Sitting President, of one whose term,
and I do not hesitate to mention it, ends, in, effectively, in a matter
of days… I call upon the President…</p>
<p><strong>ames</strong>: What does he mean The Situation has Been

<p><strong>television reporter</strong>: …and the C.I.A. Confirms the
