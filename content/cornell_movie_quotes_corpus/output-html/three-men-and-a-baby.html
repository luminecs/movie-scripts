<h1 id="three-men-and-a-baby">three-men-and-a-baby</h1>
<p><strong>1 int. airplane - day 1</strong>: On a chartered plane flying
from Miami to Newark Airport. JACK is the captain. His copilot PAUL is
seated beside him. In the passenger cabin, a female gymnastics team is
celebrating a hard-won, glorious victory over the Miami team. They are
singing, dancing in the aisles and drinking champagne.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Oh my God! I can’t believe my eyes! Look at
these women! Will you look at the gorgeous calves on them?! I’m telling
you, give me an athlete any day… Oh God! Look at that redhead over
there, and look at that one! Christ, I hadn’t noticed her. Paul, I’ve
just fallen madly in love with the most beautiful woman in the
world…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Oh yeah? Which one?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: The blonde over there, she’s too gorgeous for
words. Just look at those eyes, look at those shoulders and the way she
moves. I’m in love. Here, take over, I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hello. I’m the captain of this plane. May I
ask your name?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Sure, my name is Jane. Why?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Listen, Jane, I’ve seen many beautiful women
in my life but I swear to you, I’ve never, ever met a woman as exquisite
as you are.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Jane, can you feel my heart? It’s pounding.
This is horrible, I think I’m gonna faint. Listen: I’m madly in love
with you, I’m single and here’s my phone number.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m putting my fate in your hands. If you
don’t call me, you’ll make me the most miserable man on earth. This is
no line and I’m not trying to get you into bed. This is something
completely different. I love you Jane and if you call me I’ll be the
happiest man in the entire universe – this is ‘love at first sight.’ Out
of all these beautiful women I noticed only you, and…</p>
<p><strong>businessman</strong>: Are you Paul?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No, I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>businessman</strong>: But you’re the pilot, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yes, I’m the pilot… … I’m not even asking for
your phone number…</p>
<p><strong>businessman</strong>: Isn’t there a pilot whose name is
Paul?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah, the copilot – he’s up front…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m leaving it all up to you, Jane, but if you
do give me your phone number, then Jane, then…</p>
<p><strong>businessman</strong>: Are you Paul?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yeah… Are you Jim?</p>
<p><strong>businessman</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>businessman</strong>: Here’s your cash.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What about the stuff?</p>
<p><strong>businessman</strong>: I don’t have it. We’ve got problems.
Too much heat. Too</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Whadda ya mean us? You mean me?</p>
<p><strong>businessman</strong>: I mean shut up and listen. Two guys
will be waiting for you in a black T-Bird, expecting the dope. Just
ignore them. It’ll be delivered to you on Sunday and picked up the
following Thursday, okay?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: But I won’t be home, I’ll be in the air for
two weeks.</p>
<p><strong>businessman</strong>: That’s your problem. Make arrangements,
a deal’s a deal. Got it!?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Got it.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I got her phone number! She gave me her phone
number!</p>
<p><strong>businessman</strong>: That’s some magnificent view, isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It’s wonderful – Life is wonderful!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: This is your captain speaking. In honor of
your victory, in honor of your beauty, and in honor of Jane, the most
beautiful gymnast I have ever met. I’m going to give you a little
demonstration of aviation gymnastics – reserved only for the most
important guest, hip, hip…</p>
<p><strong>2 int. newark airport - passenger terminal - day 2</strong>:
Jack is saying an emotional goodbye to Jane as she leaves with her
teammates. Jane finds it all very funny, but Jack looks totally wretched
seeing her go. Jack and Paul walk toward the exit.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: God, what a woman!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Wanna share a cab? Yeah, sure!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: She’s so beautiful! I’ve never been so in love
before. Can you believe she gave me her phone number… Oh, Christ – where
is it?… Oh, no, don’t tell me I lost it… It’s a matter of life and
death… Oh here it is – thank God!</p>
<p><strong>graton</strong>: They’re slowing down. Take a picture.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Listen, I need a favor, I got</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah, sure… Hey, look, will you – look at that
sparkling beauty.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yeah… I mean, it’s like… There’s this little
package…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: She’ll never make it with all that luggage
she’s got. I gotta give her a hand. Look at the colors in her hair!
Christ, I’ve never seen a woman like her before…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Jack, listen, can I…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Sure you can, no problem… Listen, I gotta go
now, I’m gonna see if she’ll share a cab with me. You take the shuttle,
okay?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: But I gotta explain to you about…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Come over to my place tonight. We’re having a
huge party. Come around 9, okay? See ya later.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: As exquisite as you are… I think I’m gonna
faint.</p>
<p><strong>3 int. apartment - night 3</strong>: A large, stylishly
decorated apartment in Manhattan. A tremendous living room. A party’s
going on. Very LOUD JAZZ is PLAYING. The lights are dim. There are about
30 guests. Lots of young pretty women. Gourmet buffet. People are
sitting on couches talking, others are eating, drinking or dancing. In a
dimly-lit corner, Jack is kneeling before a girl sitting in an armchair.
She is laughing as she listens to him.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: This is no line and I’m not trying to get you
into bed. This is something completely different. This is ‘love at first
sight.’ Oh, I’m so happy… Let me go get you a glass of champagne. I’ll
be right back.</p>
<p><strong>sophia</strong>: Are you saying that’s art, are you really
saying that’s art? Well then you explain why.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: It goes back to prehistoric man. They had
comic strips on their walls, for God’s sake.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: in Michael’s</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Oh yeah, who?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: The brunette in the armchair in the living
room – her name’s Rosalie…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Clementine – she’s waiting for me in the
den.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Wait one second for me, I’ll be right
back.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: You guys have a beautiful place here. But
the rent must be a killer.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Isn’t it a killer?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What?…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh, the rent… yeah, it’s high but split
between the three of us it isn’t that bad, as long as we don’t eat.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hi Peter, I’m looking for Jack, have you seen
him?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh hi, Paul, how are you doing? Yeah, sure,
I’ll take you to Jack. Excuse me for a minute.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You’re a lifesaver, I’ve been trying to get
away from that woman</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Wait – What about Jack?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: He’s around somewhere. Check under all the
couches.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh Natalie, I’ve been looking for you all
night.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: All night? I just saw you deep in conversation
with Nicole!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Deep? Hell no, we were just talking shop.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Oh come on Peter, we all know what a
ladies’ man you are.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Who, me? Jack’s the ladies’ man, not me.
You’re the only lady I’m after.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: So tell me, how’s your project coming along? I
heard you’re not ready yet.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: We’ve still got two weeks left before the
semi-finals. We’ll be ready.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: We’ve been ready for three days now. We’re
gonna kick your ass.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Their project is really incredible.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh really? You’ve seen it?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: No, it’s top secret but he’s been telling
me about it…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Ours is incredible too.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: If you ever get it finished.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Jack, can I talk to you for a second?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Oh, hi, Paul, yeah sure…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: … Please darling, don’t move… I’ll be right
back, okay? I’ll bring us back some champagne…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You’re a lifesaver, Paul. I thought I’d never
get away. Rosalie’s waiting for me in the living room. Isn’t she
terrific?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Who? Rosalie?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Clementine.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Oh yeah, for sure, I dunno. Listen, can you do
me a favor?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah… What kind of favor? Damn, I’ve got to
get her a glass of champagne.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Listen, I’ve got a little problem. I’m having
a valuable package delivered to me on Sunday, but I’m not going to be
home. I’ve got to do the Hawaii-Tahiti-Australia route, so can I have
the package delivered here instead?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah, sure, of course. No, wait, I’m leaving
for South America tomorrow. I’ll be gone for three weeks.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: But it’s okay. Peter and Michael will be here.
They’ll take care of it.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Will you be sure to tell them about it?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Absolutely. Don’t worry about a thing.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It’ll be delivered Sunday and picked up next
Thursday, okay?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Delivered Sunday picked up Thursday. Got it.
No problem.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: This is a very delicate matter, Jack. It’s
very important they don’t tell anybody about this package. It could be
very… uh, embarrassing for me, you know what I’m saying?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Sure. You got it. I’ll see you later…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Not to anyone at all. Tell them that,
okay?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Okay, sure, not to anyone at all… Look, I’m
sorry Paul, but I gotta get back to Rosalie. Now go have a good time.
I’ll take care of everything.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Bye and thanks a lot.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Don’t mention it.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Uh-oh. Too late.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: All’s fair, old buddy…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Oh my darling, oh my darling, oh my darling
Clementine.</p>
<p><strong>4 int. apartment - few hours later - night 4</strong>: The
guests are leaving. Commotion in the hall, people are saying goodbye to
Peter and Michael. Natalie is about to walk out.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Natalie, why don’t you stay for a
nightcap?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: No, I’ve gotta get up early…</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Do you care to share a cab?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Oh yes, thanks – that’s really nice of
you…</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: triumphantly;</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Good night, Carl… I’ll call you Sunday,
Natalie.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: So you struck out again with Natalie, huh?
That Carl is a real smooth operator.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: He’s an asshole! ‘I heard you’re not ready
yet.’ ‘We’re gonna kick your ass.’ Well, we may be behind schedule, but
we’re still going to beat that sonofabitch and maybe I haven’t scored
with Natalie yet, but neither has he. She’s not an easy lay, that’s what
I like about her. You know what they say: it ain’t over till it’s
over.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Well, I didn’t do so well either – I blew
it with Rosalie. I don’t even know how…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Who’s Rosalie?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: That beauty I managed to swipe</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Your old friend Sophia appeared and got you
involved in a thrilling conversation about modern art, and meanwhile
Rosalie…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: How could you know that?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Michael, all you want to do is steal Jack’s
girl friends. You don’t give a shit about the women themselves…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: That’s not true. It’s just that Sophia
drives me crazy. She knows all the right buttons to push to make me
mad.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Anyway, it was a great party, everyone had a
good time…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: room, shouting to</p>
<p><strong>5 int. apartment - night 5</strong>: In the kitchen Peter is
straightening up. Michael joins him, dumping the ashes. Peter begins
washing the glasses.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Where’s Jack? Did he leave?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: No, he’s cuddling up with a blonde named
Clementine…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: That’s not Clementine. I saw him doing his
famous routine with Christie…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: No, it is Clementine, the one with the tits
this big…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Christie’s got tits that big, too…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Yeah, but he was with Christie at the
beginning of the evening – after that he was with Rosalie and then with
Clementine. And since I stole Rosalie away from him… Are you following
this?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Nice work if you can get it, and you can get
it if you try… Any scotch left?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah, here, I just put it away.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Sorry I can’t give you guys a hand, but I’ve
got something cooking.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I thought you were leaving at dawn for South
America?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I am, the night’s still young!… It’s gonna be
a lively one. I’m gonna make us a little snack.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: So, who is it anyway – Christie or
Clementine?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Maxine. Beautiful, enchanting Maxine.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hey, Michael – how’d it go with Rosalie?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Well, things were going great until…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Your old friend Sophia appeared and dragged
you into a thrilling conversation about modern art and in the meantime
Rosalie took off with someone else.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: How did you know?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I dunno – lucky guess…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Well, I don’t give a damn anyway, I have 24
drawings to hand in to my editor three days from now and I gotta work
all night anyway… So it was all for the best. But you better not leave
that Maxine’s phone number lying around because when I’m done…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Don’t worry, I’ll leave you her phone number
on the hall table. If she’s really terrific I’ll put a big ‘X’ next to
it. ’Bye, guys – love ya. I won’t wake you tomorrow morning. See you in
three weeks…</p>
<p><strong>6 int. apartment - dawn 6</strong>: Jack and Maxine
noiselessly exit the apartment. Jack is wearing his pilot’s uniform.
Maxine pushes the button for the elevator. Jack sneaks back into the
apartment and leaves a note on the hall table that says: “Maxine
227-2013.” Next to the number Jack has put a big “X.”</p>
<p><strong>7 ext. street in front of apartment - dawn 7</strong>: Jack
and Maxine exchange a brief kiss and go their separate ways.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Damn! I forgot to tell them about the package!
I gotta make a quick phone call. I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: Jack, there’ll be plenty of girls where we’re
going.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Oh, c’mon, I’ve really got to make a phone
call! What do you think I’m going to do, pick up one of the New Jersey
delegates to the I.B.M. convention?</p>
<p><strong>9 int. architecture office - day 9</strong>: In the
architecture firm of which Peter is one of three partners. The whole
staff, about 15 people in all, is gathered around a large model, the
project for a big amusement park. They all seem worried about something.
JERRY, one of Peter’s partners, seems particularly angry.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: The model’s not finished, the blueprints are
a mess and you may as well forget the specs, they’re a disaster! I know
we’re talented. I know we’re good. Then why is it we can never get
organized? Why is it we’re always behind schedule?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Look, Jerry, architects since Leonardo have
always been behind schedule. It’s a tradition, for</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Because this is the chance of a lifetime for
our company, and there happens to be a deadline. There are millions of
dollars at stake here. And our main competition had their project in
three days ago!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah, but word around town is their project’s
a piece of shit!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Of course, it’s a piece of shit, but it’s a
ready piece of shit.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: We’re just going to have to buckle down, that’s
all.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: You’re damn right we are. Starting now,
everybody works around the clock! Everybody! We have two weeks to be
ready for the semi- final selection. And we will be ready. And we will
win. You want to know why we’ll win?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Because we’re gonna cheat.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’ll go bribe the judges!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I don’t think this is a joking matter,
gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Come on, Jerry…</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: There’s an urgent call for you,
Peter.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’m not in.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: It’s Jack – he says it’s ‘super
important…’</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hi… yeah… listen, make it quick, I’m in a
meeting here… yeah, a package… okay… someone’ll drop it off Sunday and
pick it up Thursday… No problem … yeah… we’ll put it aside, okay… no,
no, we won’t tell anybody about it… Is that it?… Right, we won’t tell
anyone… Hey – love ‘n’ kisses to the Brazilian girls, vaya con dios, old
buddy.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>10 int. apartment - day 10</strong>: Peter, dressed in casual
clothes, knocks on the door of Michael’s room, and peeks in. Michael is
asleep fully clothed on his bed. His drawing table is strewn with
papers, overflowing ashtrays and empty coffee cups. The lamp is still
on.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’m going out for bagels – how many you want,
three or four?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Eleven-thirty.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: A.M. or P.M.?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: A.M. C’mon, up ‘n’ at ’em.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Up ‘n’ at ’em yourself, asshole – I just
went to bed.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Nah, I didn’t get anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Well then… nap time’s over. Back to work. So
how many bagels, three or four?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Six, six!</p>
<p><strong>11 int. apartment hallway - day 11</strong>: Peter opens the
front door, he stumbles over an object, looks down; at his feet he sees
a wicker basket lined with pretty pink-and-white checked gingham. In the
basket a tiny baby lies fast asleep, her head gently resting on a lace
pillow. Peter looks at this object in amazement. There is an envelope
pinned to the basket with the words, “FOR JACK” written on it. Peter
picks up the letter – he opens it and reads.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You gotta be kidding!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Michael! Michael!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Get your ass out here and see what’s on the
doorstep. This has gotta be somebody’s idea of a joke!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Look for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: It’s a basket with a baby in it.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No shit. ‘Dearest Jack, here is the fruit of
our love. Take good care of her. I have to go to Europe and Japan for
six months, her name is Mary. Good luck, Love, Sylvia.’</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: What are we going to do with it?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Give it back to her mother, that’s what.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: But it says she went to Europe.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Well, we’ll see about that, d’you have her
phone number?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Whose phone number?</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: The girl’s… Sylvia’s…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Why the hell would I have her number? I’ve
never even heard of this chick!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You mean you don’t know who she is?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: No way. If I had to keep track of all
Jack’s girlfriends, I’d have to be a full-time secretary.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Well, what are we gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Hey, look, she’s waking up… Hey, look,
she’s crying…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh no, this can’t be happening! She’s not
gonna start to cry now?!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What’s her problem?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Maybe she’s hungry?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Well, what are we s’posed to do?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Feed her, I guess…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah, but what?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Soft stuff… I guess.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh no, I swear to God this is unreal! Can you
believe that bastard Jack?! ‘A little package,’ he tells me on the
phone, ‘just put it aside till Thursday.’ Put it aside – can you believe
him!?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Really? Jack said that?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah and he also said ‘don’t tell anyone
about it – anyone at all.’</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Oh, so he told you about this?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah, he told me a package would be coming
today, but he didn’t say it’d be this!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Boy, he’s got a helluva nerve!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Just listen to the racket she’s making! What
are we s’posed to do?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Let’s call Jack’s mother!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: She lives in Miami for Christsake. She can’t
stop the baby crying from Miami.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Well, just to ask her advice…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No, he said not to tell anyone…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: But this is an emergency!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No! No way! You know what a pain that woman
is – she’ll be on the next plane here to move in with us…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Maybe I should call my mother…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No, please – leave the mothers out of this,
okay?! It’s only four days. We should be able to handle that, besides
you know the rule around here: it’s fine to have a woman over once in a
while, but…</p>
<p><strong>peter and michael</strong>: … never for more than one night
at a time!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: And that includes mothers!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Where are you going?!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’m going to the store to buy some baby
food.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: What am I supposed to do while you’re
gone?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Pick her up and hold her.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Whaddya mean, pick her up? I’ve never held
a baby – I’ll drop her!</p>
<p><strong>12 int. safeway - day 12</strong>: Peter enters the store and
rushes right over to a store</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What aisle’s baby food on?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Down there by the meat section.</p>
<p><strong>13 int. apartment - day 13</strong>: Michael is still in the
hall holding Mary very clumsily in his arms. He is anxious. He realizes
she’s soaked. This disgusts him. He holds her at arm’s length; she
squirms. He goes and gets a towel from the bathroom, spreads it out on
the living room couch and lays the baby down on it. MARY SCREAMS – she
much prefers Michael’s arms to the couch. A panicky Michael picks her up
again, grumbling.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Okay, okay, don’t cry like that… I’ll hold
you, I’ll hold you.</p>
<p><strong>14 int. safeway - day 14</strong>: Peter is talking with a
Safeway CLERK, a woman in her 50’s, who is tall and heavy, somewhat
gruff and masculine in appearance, and wearing slacks and a smock.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: So what’s the best brand?</p>
<p><strong>store clerk</strong>: Depends on what your pediatrician
recommends.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh right, the pediatrician… But which one
sells the most?</p>
<p><strong>store clerk</strong>: This kind.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh, so this is the best kind?</p>
<p><strong>store clerk</strong>: It’s the cheapest.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Then it’s the worst kind?</p>
<p><strong>store clerk</strong>: They’re all good, sir.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh, okay, then I can take this kind.</p>
<p><strong>store clerk</strong>: It’s got iron in it.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh. Is that good or bad?</p>
<p><strong>store clerk</strong>: It’s very good.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Well, why don’t they all have iron in
them?</p>
<p><strong>store clerk</strong>: Some babies are allergic to iron.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh, okay, well I’ll take this kind then.</p>
<p><strong>store clerk</strong>: That kind doesn’t have any milk in
it.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh, I see, there’s milk with no milk in
it?</p>
<p><strong>store clerk</strong>: Some babies are allergic to milk.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: So what’s the stuff that no babies are
allergic to?</p>
<p><strong>store clerk</strong>: Soy formula.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh, okay, I’ll take the soy formula.</p>
<p><strong>store clerk</strong>: That one’s Advance.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh really? What’s Advance?</p>
<p><strong>store clerk</strong>: How old’s your baby?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: estimate Mary’s</p>
<p><strong>15 int. apartment - day 15</strong>: MARY is SCREAMING in
Michael’s arms as he walks her up and down the whole apartment. Now
there are three towels wrapped around her. Michael is exasperated. He
angrily sings her a lullaby.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Rock-a-bye baby on the tree top…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Stop crying now; c’mon, stop… quit it, will
you?… When the wind blows, the cradle will rock… What is that jerk
doing? Milking the cows or something?… When the bough breaks the cradle
will fall…</p>
<p><strong>16 int. safeway - day 16</strong>: Now Peter is surrounded by
three women arguing: The Store Clerk standing with her arms crossed and
haughtily looking down on everyone; an efficient, practical sort of
young woman ; and another thin, pale woman whose baby is lying in a baby
carrier in her shopping cart and who seems very nervous .</p>
<p><strong>woman #1</strong>: Does she have any teeth yet or not? That
would give us a clue as to how old she is.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I haven’t looked.</p>
<p><strong>store clerk</strong>: My grandson’s only five months old and
he already has two teeth. But my daughter didn’t have a single one at
seven months – so, y’know, how many teeth they have… doesn’t mean a
thing.</p>
<p><strong>woman #2</strong>: But didn’t those friends of yours tell you
what formula they usually give the baby?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No, actually they had to leave unexpectedly.
They had to catch a plane…</p>
<p><strong>woman #1</strong>: Is she teething?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Teething?</p>
<p><strong>woman #1</strong>: Does she drool? Does she cry all night
long? Does she chew on her fists? Does she put everything into her
mouth?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I know she can’t talk.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: starting to get on</p>
<p><strong>woman #1</strong>: Or else you could weigh her; that would
tell you how old she is.</p>
<p><strong>store clerk</strong>: See, my five-month-old grandson weighs
more than my neighbor’s grandson and he’s nine months old. So, y’know,
how much they weigh… doesn’t mean a thing.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: So what about me? What should I buy?</p>
<p><strong>woman #2</strong>: Didn’t they even tell you the
pediatrician’s name?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No. They didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>woman #2</strong>: You sure have weird friends.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You have no idea how weird.</p>
<p><strong>woman #1</strong>: Or else her hair. Does she have lots of
hair?</p>
<p><strong>store clerk</strong>: My grandson, y’know, he has so much
hair you can make a ponytail with it! And I know some kids who are
totally bald at a year- and-a-half. So, y’know, how much hair they have…
doesn’t mean a thing…</p>
<p><strong>woman #1</strong>: Gee, he’s really something, your grandson
– is he good at math too?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Look, ladies, thanks for all the advice. But
I think I’ll just take one of each. To be on the safe side.</p>
<p><strong>stock clerk</strong>: Don’t forget – if the baby’s less than
three months old, you have to be sure to sterilize the bottles.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What bottles?</p>
<p><strong>woman #2</strong>: You know what? This must be a
kidnapping.</p>
<p><strong>17 int. apartment - day 17</strong>: Michael is rapidly
pacing up and down the apartment, vigorously rocking Mary. As soon as he
sits down anywhere to rest, MARY SCREAMS, so Michael pops back up and
begins the marathon all over again.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little
lamb, if that jerk isn’t back in three seconds I swear I’ll throw her
down the garbage chute… Mary had a little lamb, little lamb…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Well, it’s about goddamn time!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Where the hell have you been?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Oh – Hi, Mrs. Razzolini!</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: This package came for you… Oh! What a cute
little baby! Is it yours?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: No, it’s not me, I mean she’s not mine…</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Oh, so it’s Peter’s?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: No, no, it’s Jack’s, I mean it’s not
Jack’s, it’s… someone loaned it to us, I mean someone…</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: And what’s the little girl’s name?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Mary.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Ooh, what a pwetty wittle name, Mary! I
didn’t know you had a baby…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Yeah, well, I have to put her to bed
now.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: You have to put her to bed? Where’s Mary’s
mommy?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: She’s… she’s not here. She’ll be back
soon.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Oh here, this just came for you. They just
dropped it off. Can I hold her for a second?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Well, like, y’see… she doesn’t like to be
held by strangers…</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: She loves to be held by strangers! Hey,
she’s soaking wet hmm, no I think it’s number 2. Want me to give you a
hand changing her?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Oh no, don’t worry, I’m used to it. Well,
so long, Mrs. Razzolini.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: ’Bye, Mary, I’ll come back to visit.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: What a leech! And that other idiot isn’t
back yet!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: So you love to be held by strangers, do
you?</p>
<p><strong>18 int. safeway - day 18</strong>: In the baby food aisle
there are now five women arguing. Peter, his arms still laden with cans,
looks uncomfort- able.</p>
<p><strong>woman #2</strong>: This guy doesn’t even know how old his
baby is and you don’t find that strange?</p>
<p><strong>woman #1</strong>: This guy asked for advice, I’m giving him
advice, Okay? If you’re so paranoid, why don’t you run home and chain
your kid to his crib?</p>
<p><strong>woman #2</strong>: Anyway, I think someone should call the
cops.</p>
<p><strong>19 int. apartment - day 19</strong>: Peter comes in with bags
in his arms. Michael, holding the baby, dashes toward him, extremely
pissed off.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: What the hell were you doing? You’ve been
gone for hours! This damn kid’s been crying the whole time. I’ve got a
lot better things to do with my time! You’re a real pain in the ass!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hey, how dare you speak to me like that!
You’ve never spoken to me like that before…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Well, what the hell took you so long?
What’d you do, go out for breakfast or something? I didn’t even have
time for a cup of coffee, for chrissakes.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Will you please cut it out for a second, huh?
I didn’t have any coffee either, it took me forever at the goddamn
Safeway.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Okay, well, here – take the kid, I’ve got
work to do.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Whaddaya mean, take the kid? I can’t hold her
and make her bottle at the same time. And why should I be the one to
hold her?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: ’Cause, it’s your problem. You found this
kid.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hey, asshole, I’m the one who found</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Jesus, there she goes again! We gotta feed
her something.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah, well you just don’t feed a baby. First
you gotta look and see if she has any teeth or not.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: To figure out how old she is so we know what
to feed her, that’s why.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Do you look on top or bottom?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: How do I know?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Try feeling with your finger.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I can’t feel anything – I’ll give her the
stuff for newborns and hope she’s not allergic to it.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: And then we’ll have to see if she’s allergic
to iron, to soy or to milk – you can’t imagine how much stuff they can
be allergic to!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: She’s soaking wet – did you buy any
diapers?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Diapers?</p>
<p><strong>19a int. safeway - day 19a</strong>: Michael rushes in and
stops short in front of the moun- tains of diaper boxes that he starts
examining in bewil- derment. Finally, he approaches the Store Clerk.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Excuse me, miss, could you tell me which
diapers are the most absorbent?</p>
<p><strong>store clerk</strong>: I would suggest the ones that say
‘ultra-absorbent.’</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Yeah, but which are better: 20-35 pounds or
12-24 pounds?</p>
<p><strong>store clerk</strong>: Depends how much your baby weighs.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Oh right, how much she weighs…</p>
<p><strong>store clerk</strong>: You wouldn’t happen to have a friend
who came in here a little while ago, would you?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I have no idea what you’re talking about!
He’s no friend of mine.</p>
<p><strong>20 int. kitchen - day 20</strong>: Mary, in Peter’s arms, is
devouring her bottle.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh shit, my slacks! Goddamn her, she took a
crap!</p>
<p><strong>21 int. apartment living room - day 21</strong>: Peter and
Michael have laid Mary down on the couch, taking care to place several
towels between her bottom and the immaculate velvet. Mary is squirming,
laughing, feeling great. They have already gone through half a box of
cotton in their attempts to clean up the crap. But it’s still all over,
on their hands, on the baby’s feet and legs, on the towels, etc.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hold her. Hold her, goddamn it!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I can’t hold her. This kid’s out of control
here!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Just gimme the cotton.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh for chrissake, don’t just let go of
her!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Then get the cotton yourself if you don’t
want me to let go of her!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Take the towels off – They’re full of
shit.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: But the couch’ll get dirty!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah, but she keeps getting it all over
herself. Man, this shit is sticky!… We need cleaning fluid or something
to get it off…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: How ’bout after-shave?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Are you kidding?! Waste our Saint Laurent on
babyshit?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Okay, let’s just put the diaper</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: These tape things – do they go on the front
or the back?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: How am I supposed to know…?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hold her under her arms – I’m gonna try it
this way.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What the hell kind of lousy stinking diapers
did you get? They’re way too big!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I don’t think they’re too big – They’re
ultra-absorbent. That’s all. The more absorbent the better.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: How the hell do these tape things work? Hold
her for chrissakes!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: My arms are getting tired.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: There. I got it.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Damn it. I didn’t make it tight enough.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: It’s not working… What about laying her
down?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Go ahead… No, not on the towels, they’re all
covered with crap…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: … What the hell is this friggin’ mess? Oh,
man, this is unbelievable! To think, they bombard us day and night with
their goddamn TV commercials! And will you look at this junk? This stuff
is pure shit – You tape it closed, it sags, you undo the tape: bingo –
the whole goddamn thing falls apart!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Well, whaddya expect, if you pull on it
like an ape, it’s gonna rip!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Michael, will you give me a break, will you
please?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh shit! Now she’s pissing. Look at the
couch. The sneaky little bitch was just waiting for me to get the diaper
off, then whammo…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I happen to like my furniture. I’m going out
to get some real diapers. You can clean the couch up in the
meantime.</p>
<p><strong>24 int. kitchen - day 24</strong>: Michael is throwing a heap

to be flying the Miami-Caracas-Rio route… The guy who proposed to you?…
Oh, did he?… Well, congratulations. Please… listen to me… you must
contact him and tell him he’s got to call home immediately. Okay? It’s
an emergency, a family problem… No, don’t worry, he’s not married to
someone else. It’s another kind of family</p>

finally drinking a cup of coffee at the kitchen table. In silence.</p>
<p><strong>31 int. living room - day 31</strong>: Peter and Michael are
standing beside the basket. MARY is SCREAMING; they are bewildered.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Maybe she’s allergic to something?</p>

<p><strong>peter</strong>: Already?</p>
<p><strong>32 int. kitchen - day 32</strong>: Peter is making the

alone with her.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I told you – I have a date.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: You rotten bastard – do you see me going
out on any dates?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Look, it’s with Natalie – I’ve been after her
for months already.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: So what! If you leave me alone with this
kid, I swear I’ll pack up and be outta here by morning.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You’re a real drag, y’know? Tonight was gonna
be my big night! Now I bet it’s gonna be Carl’s big night.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hello, Natalie? It’s Peter. Listen, I’m
really screwed. Jerry just called and we’ve run into a snag with the
blueprints for the competition, it’s an emergency. I’ve gotta go over to
the office right away, I think it’s gonna be an all-nighter… Of course I
didn’t know about this yesterday – he just called me.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hello? Hello?… No, I’m not trying to hang up
on you. We’re having some problems with the phone, that’s all… No,
Natalie, there’s no one else here! You’re the only woman I… I swear I’m
not lying to you… What? You’re going to call Carl? Okay, go ahead, call

makes you think I’m jealous?</p>
<p><strong>45 int. kitchen - evening 45</strong>: Peter and Michael are
silently eating sandwiches at a corner of the kitchen table. Peter is
fuming. Michael glances at him out of the corner of his eye.</p>
<p><strong>46 int. living room - night 46</strong>: Michael, completely
zonked, is changing Mary as best he can. Peter sits, waiting, on the

sick. Seriously ill. I’m burning up… The doctor had to come, I’ve gotta

<p><strong>49 int. apartment - day 49</strong>: Peter, wearing a coat,
enters carrying packages that he puts down in the living room, now
transformed into a nursery. A makeshift changing table, rubber wash
basin, baby clothes, baby lotion, talcum powder, soap and baby shampoo,
etc. are all over the place. He drops all his purchases on the floor,
sits down on the couch and picks up a book, in which he’s instantly
absorbed: we see from the cover that it’s a book on children.</p>
<p><strong>50 int. peter’s room - day 50</strong>: Peter is lying on his
bed now surrounded by dozens of baby-care books. Many of which are open.
He’s reading them with great passion, and making notes.</p>

on the floor surrounded by his drawings. Mary is lying next to him.</p>

morning as I</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: On second thought, Mr. Oxman… uh, better
make that the end of next week. Please don’t get upset, Mr. Oxman. I’ll
do everything possible to get them to you sooner… You have my word… I
apologize again, Mr. Oxman… Thank you again, Mr. Oxman. Goodb… …
Mr. Oxman? Hello, Mr. Oxman?</p>
<p><strong>52 int. living room - dusk 52</strong>: The living room is a
total mess. A harrassed Peter, lying on the floor, dreamily watches Mary
who is lying on her tummy in a sheet, playing with a SQUEAKY RUBBER
GIRAFFE. They look at each other, as sober as judges.</p>
<p><strong>53 int. living room - night 53</strong>: Peter and Michael
are asleep in their bathrobes on the living room couches. Peter has a
child care book over his face. MARY, in her basket, wakes up and utters
a FEW LITTLE NOISES. The two men jump up and go over to her basket like
robots. Mary looks at them and smiles.</p>
<p><strong>54 int. kitchen - night 54</strong>: Michael is giving her
night feeding. Mary is falling asleep in his arms; the nipple falls out
of her mouth, which goes on sucking anyway. Michael is falling asleep,
too, his head lolling over to one side.</p>
<p><strong>55 int. living room - day 55</strong>: The living room is
back to normal, spic ‘n’ span. They’ve gotten rid of all the baby
paraphernalia. The</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: He didn’t say what time?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: All he said was Thursday.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Terrific! – We could rot here till eight
o’clock tonight.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Well, I’m prepared to rot here till midnight
if I have to, as long as we get rid of her.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Jack really could have called. He has to
have gotten our message by now.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Well, when he does call, I’m gonna let him
have it! That sonofabitch is on the beaches of Brazil proposing to the
whole goddamn world. And we’re here living in hell! He’s gonna get his
ass on the next plane back here. Vacation’s over, Jack-baby, you better
believe it.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Damn right! It’s almost time for her
bottle, you know.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh hell!</p>
<p><strong>56 ext. street - day 56</strong>: On the street two men drive
by on a motorcycle looking at the numbers on the apartment buildings.
They stop a few yards from the entrance to Peter, Michael and Jack’s
building.</p>
<p><strong>punk #1</strong>: Jack Collins live here?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Yes, he does.</p>
<p><strong>punk #1</strong>: We came for the package.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Package? Oh that’s cute, referring to her as
a package! Anyway, you can tell Sylvia she’s a lousy stinking bitch.</p>
<p><strong>punk #1</strong>: Sylvia?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah, Sylvia! You can tell her she’s got a
hell of a nerve dumping her problems into our laps!</p>
<p><strong>punk #1</strong>: Problems? Did you guys have trouble?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Do you have any idea what it’s been like
around here for the past four days?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: She could have at least given us a phone
number or the name of someone to contact…</p>
<p><strong>punk #1</strong>: I don’t get it. Didn’t they tell you we
were gonna be here today?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Sure they told us! So what? That doesn’t
make the last four days any less hellish than they were!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Well, anyway, they’re here now, that’s all
that matters!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: The next bottle’s in 45 minutes. I made it
already. It’s in the basket.</p>
<p><strong>punk #1</strong>: Bottle? Whadda ya mean, bottle?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: About an hour after her bottle, she starts
yawning. Put her to bed right away or it’s pure hell for the next three
hours, at least that’s what we’ve noticed.</p>
<p><strong>punk #1</strong>: What the hell is that? A baby?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No, it’s a very short teenager. Of course
it’s a baby! Now listen carefully: I’m giving you a can of the milk
she’s been getting. She loves it, and more importantly,</p>
<p><strong>punk #1</strong>: Oh! I get it! Powdered milk! Very
clever!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah, right… real clever… Okay, here. She’s
all yours. Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>punk #1</strong>: Okay, I got it. You can take her out
now.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Take what out? I’m not taking anything
out.</p>
<p><strong>punk #1</strong>: Wait a minute, I don’t get it! We take the
basket and the milk, that’s all. We ain’t gonna take the… what’s
inside.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Whadda ya mean, what’s inside?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: You take it all, man! It’s a package
deal!</p>
<p><strong>punk #1</strong>: But what are we s’posed to do with it?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: How do I know? You take it where they told
you to take it.</p>
<p><strong>punk #1</strong>: Y’mean, I take it to the connection?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Yeah, whatever you want to call it.</p>
<p><strong>punk #1</strong>: Are you sure that’s the plan?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: You bet that’s the plan! We’re not keeping
her one more second.</p>
<p><strong>punk #1</strong>: Okay, if that’s the plan…</p>
<p><strong>punk #1</strong>: … Here, hold this. Okay, so long!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Uh… listen… maybe you could leave us the
address or the phone number just in case. So we can find out how she’s
doing?</p>
<p><strong>punk #1</strong>: Oh, yeah, sure, the address. Oh shit, I
don’t have it on me… But I’ll call you. Okay, so long!</p>
<p><strong>peter &amp; michael</strong>: So long!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Aah, relief at last! Good riddance!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: You said it! Now maybe I can get some work
done.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What the hell is this?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Well, a package, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Was this package delivered to you?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Yeah, why?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: When the hell did this package arrive?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Will you quit shouting!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: When did this fucking package fucking arrive,
Michael?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I don’t know… Oh yeah, Sunday –
Mrs. Razzolini brought it up…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Holy shit!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: This is the package those guys came for, not
the baby, you asshole.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Hey, asshole yourself!… Oh shit!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Look out the window and see if you see them,
I’m gonna try to</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Goddamit!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What the hell is this?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh, God, no… dope! That’s all we need!</p>
<p><strong>59 ext. street - day 59</strong>: Punk #1 is attempting to
strap the basket onto the motorcycle with a bungie cord. Punk #2 watches
him coolly.</p>
<p><strong>punk #2</strong>: We’d be better off taking the subway.</p>
<p><strong>punk #1</strong>: You want to ride the subway with a hundred
grand in uncut dope, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>punk #2</strong>: Well we can’t ride around carrying this
baby basket. We’ll get stopped by the cops.</p>
<p><strong>punk #1</strong>: So go ahead, take the subway and stop
bothering me. I’m going to hook this onto the back seat.</p>
<p><strong>punk #2</strong>: It’ll never hold, man.</p>
<p><strong>punk #1</strong>: at the hook and</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh, thank God, you’re still here! There’s
been a terrible mistake. That wasn’t the package you were s’posed to
take. It was another one. I have it right here.</p>
<p><strong>punk #1</strong>: What do you mean? What other package?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’ll take the basket back and give you the
other package, here. No mistake.</p>
<p><strong>punk #1</strong>: You ain’t takin’ nothin’ back, man.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: But I’m tellin you it was a mistake…</p>
<p><strong>punk #1</strong>: You tryin’ to double-cross us or something?
Beat it before I get pissed, man.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: in an equally</p>
<p><strong>punk #1</strong>: A mistake my ass! Now get outa here, man,
or I’m gonna stick this right in your gut.</p>
<p><strong>punk #1</strong>: Start the bike.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: But I’m telling you, I’ve got the real
package in my pocket.</p>
<p><strong>punk #2</strong>: Watch it, the cops!</p>
<p><strong>graton</strong>: Terrific! I bet these morons screw up
everything.</p>
<p><strong>punk #1</strong>: If you called the cops on us, pal, you’re a
dead man.</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: All right, what’s that doing on the back of
the bike?</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: You wouldn’t by any chance be intending to
drive with a baby basket on your motorcycle, would you?</p>
<p><strong>punk #1</strong>: Of course not, Officer. We’d never do
something like that.</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: So why did you strap it on in the first
place if you had no intention of driving with it?</p>
<p><strong>punk #2</strong>: So it wouldn’t fall off.</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: Very funny.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No, really, Officer, they weren’t gonna drive
off with it – They were just watching it for me while I was doing a
quick errand. Thanks, guys.</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: All right, let’s see some identification,
everybody.</p>
<p><strong>punk #1</strong>: Go!</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: Watch the guy with the basket!</p>
<p><strong>cop #2</strong>: Freeze! All right, asshole, let’s see some
I.D.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Listen, Officer, let’s stay calm now. I
haven’t the slightest intention of running. I am not a criminal. I’m an
architect.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’m terribly sorry, Officer, but I don’t have
any identification on me. I just came down with my baby to run a quick
errand. I haven’t committed any crime.</p>
<p><strong>cop #2</strong>: All right, let’s go, in the car. I’m taking
you down to the station.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh, c’mon, that’s impossible – you see I have
a baby. I have to give her a bottle in fifteen minutes, I can’t go
anywhere. I live right in this building – let me go up to my apartment
and I’ll get you my license immediately… You can even come with me if
you like…</p>
<p><strong>cop #2</strong>: All right, lead the way.</p>
<p><strong>graton</strong>: Inspector Graton, Narcotics. It just so
happens I was tailing those two guys and now because of you clowns I
lost them, probably forever. Thanks a lot!</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: How could we know?</p>
<p><strong>graton</strong>: Forget it. Listen, your partner went in here
with the guy and the baby. He lives up on the tenth floor. I can’t go in
because if he sees me, my cover is blown. So could you please try not to
lose this one, okay? He’s someone who’s</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: This is it. Please come in… can I get you a
cup of coffee or something?</p>
<p><strong>cop #2</strong>: No thanks. I’ll just wait out here.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Hey, what’s happening? What were those cops
doing…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Michael… Michael… we’re in deep trouble. The
package… The package…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Yeah? What?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: There’s a cop on the doorstep… He didn’t see
you… He mustn’t see you… We’re in deep trouble, Michael…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Tell me what…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: The package they came for wasn’t the baby, it
was dope, drugs, a shitload of dope! We were stopped by some cops down
on the street.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: But did the cops see the dope?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No, it’s right here.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: We’ll get twenty years if the cops find this
on us! Climb down the fire escape and hide it… anywhere!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hey, whatever you do, don’t lose the goddamn
dope, we gotta be able to return it to those dealers or we’re dead.
Those guys are serious.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Don’t worry.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Oh, by the way, I put some water up to boil
for her bottle.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Here’s my license.</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: I’m afraid I’m going to have to ask you to
remain in the apartment. The narcotics squad will be arriving any moment
now. They want to ask you a few questions.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Narcotics squad? What do they want with me? I
don’t even use aspirin!</p>
<p><strong>61 int. supermarket - day 61</strong>: Michael is buying a
pair of scissors, glue and a roll of Scotch tape. Then he buys a box of
large diapers – he chooses the ones that come in a box. Michael leaves
the supermarket, whistling.</p>
<p><strong>62 ext. park - day 62</strong>: Michael is sitting on a bench
facing the grass, with his back to us, he seems quite busy. As we CLOSE
IN, we discover that he has opened the box of diapers and that he’s
holding one of them; its plastic has been carefully cut out with
scissors. Casually, glancing right and left, he takes the individ- ual
packets of white powder out of his pocket and shoves them into a little
plastic bag from the supermarket. Then he carefully tapes the bag so
it’s well-sealed and flattened out, and he inserts it into the diaper,
be- tween the plastic and the absorbent fabric. Next, the diaper is
taped up, folded back up and put back in the box, neatly packed between
the other ones. Michael closes the box again and glues it together so it
looks as if it’s never been opened. He throws all the other stuff away
in a trash can and grabs hold of his brand-new box of diapers. He walks
away.</p>
<p><strong>63 int. apartment - day 63</strong>: Michael comes into the
living room with his box of diapers and a bag of groceries. In addition
to the two cops there are now THREE NARCOTIC AGENTS who are
interrogating Peter. He is holding Mary. The basket is on an
armchair.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Hello, Officers… What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Don’t worry, Michael, it’s nothing serious,
just a little misunderstanding.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Did you give her the 5:30 bottle?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah, I just gave it to her.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Did you change her?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No, she’s soaking wet.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Okay, I’ll do it.</p>
<p><strong>agent #1</strong>: And who’s he?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: He’s my roommate.</p>
<p><strong>agent #1</strong>: Oh, I see, I see…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No, you don’t see. There are three of us
sharing this place.</p>
<p><strong>agent #1</strong>: Oh, three, huh? A regular ‘mirage a
trois’!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: It’s ‘menage’… and it’s not. We all have lots
of girlfriends, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>agent #1</strong>: Uh-huh, so what’s your friend do?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: He’s a cartoonist.</p>
<p><strong>agent #1</strong>: What about the other guy?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: He’s a pilot.</p>
<p><strong>agent #1</strong>: Ah-hah… Now that’s interesting…</p>
<p><strong>agent #1</strong>: So does this friend of yours ever fly to
South America?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No. Never. Only North America.</p>
<p><strong>agent #1</strong>: Would you object if I answered it for
you?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Not at all, go right ahead. I’ve got nothing
to hide.</p>
<p><strong>agent #1</strong>: It’s a collect call from a Jack Collins in
La Paz, Bolivia. That wouldn’t happen to be your pilot friend, would it?
The one who never goes to South America?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yes, it is him.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hello, yes, operator, I accept the
charges.</p>
<p><strong>agent #1</strong>: Would you mind very much if I
listened?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Please, go right ahead.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hello, Jack? Fine, yeah. How’re you? Yeah,
he’s fine, too. Yeah, we left a message for you, right… No, it was
nothing</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I said everything’s fine! The what?… I don’t
know what you’re talking about… Oh yeah, the package! Yeah, yeah, it got
here … and was picked up, uh-huh. Hey! Why didn’t you call sooner? Huh?
’Cause what?… Oh, you’re onto something hot – well, aren’t you the lucky
one!… So when are you getting married?… Forget it, I was just kidding…
Well, everything’s fine up here. So have a good time. See you in a
couple of weeks. ’Bye.</p>
<p><strong>agent #1</strong>: Now that’s interesting. So you wanna tell
me about this package and the hot something-or-other your friend lucked
onto… in La Paz… Bolivia… South America?</p>
<p><strong>65 int. michael’s room - day 65</strong>: Mary is lying on
Michael’s bed. He has just finished putting a regular diaper on her.
Then Michael looks for the tampered-with diaper in the box. He finds it,
checks that it is well-sealed, and places it under Mary’s bottom. Just
then Agent #3 appears in the doorway. Michael calmly finishes putting
the dope-filled diaper on the baby on top of the other one. MARY is
COOING. Every- thing appears normal. However, a trained eye might be
very surprised by the enormous thickness of the diaper covering the
young lady’s backside. But a narcotics agent is not necessarily the most
qualified person to notice something odd like this. Agent #3 silently
observes Michael, who gives him a big smile as he slips on Mary’s pajama
bottoms. Michael picks Mary up and for the first time talks to her in
the kind of silly babytalk used by adoring parents.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Okey-dokey, honeybunch, it’s time to go
beddy-bye now… We’re gonna take a nice long nappy-wappy…</p>
<p><strong>agent #1</strong>: Do you recognize anyone in this
picture?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Sure. This is Jack Collins.</p>
<p><strong>agent #1</strong>: Oh yeah? Now that’s interesting.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: So! Can I get you something to drink?</p>
<p><strong>agent #1</strong>: So, who’s the baby belong to?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: It’s Jack’s daughter.</p>
<p><strong>agent #1</strong>: And why are you two taking care of
her?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Because her mother’s in Europe for six
months, and since Jack had to be away for two weeks, I took my vacation
to take care of her, I love kids.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Yeah, Peter and I just love kids!</p>
<p><strong>agent #1</strong>: Now that’s interesting. Well, we’ll be
seeing each other again soon, in fact very soon. In the</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Come back anytime, gentlemen. You’re always
welcome here. We have no particular plans to leave New York in the near
future, so don’t worry about us now. ’Bye now.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Christ, what a mess! They’ll be on our tails
around the clock! How the hell are we gonna get rid of the goddamn
dope?! By the way, where is it?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: It’s cool, don’t worry, I got it
stashed.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: This way it’s close at hand!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Are you out of your mind??</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Relax, will you.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I diapered the dope on her right in front
of the cop and he never noticed a thing!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I told the cops we were taking care of her.
You realize we’re now stuck with the kid till Jack</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Wait a minute. You’re not gonna stick me
with this kid! Tell them you need a maternity leave, tell them anything,
but we’ve got to go 50-50 on this!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: And that’s not all – we haven’t heard from
the punks yet either!</p>
<p><strong>66 ext. street - day 66</strong>: Hidden within a parked car,
three men are keeping a close watch on the entrance to Peter, Michael
and Jack’s build- ing. The two uniformed cops emerge, get in their car,
and pull away.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: That’s right, you heard right: I’m not coming
in to work for two weeks… No, I can’t explain why… … Because I can’t,
that’s all!… NO, this has nothing to do with chasing ass! Jerry… Jerry!
Will you stop screaming for a minute and listen? I’m in trouble, you
understand? Deep trouble… I know… I know…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: … Goddammit, Jerry, of course winning the
competition is important to me! The firm’s my whole life if you must
know. No, no, please – don’t send anyone over here… Don’t you come
either. No, Jerry… Okay, listen, I’ll be there in a half-hour, but I
can’t stay long. No! Don’t come here! I’ll be right over.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You’re going now?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Yeah, but don’t worry about it, I’ll be
back before it’s time for her next bottle. She’s asleep now.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Terrific, just terrific! Jerry just called: I
have to go to the office right now.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Well, call him back. Tell him you’ll come
later.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: There’s no way. I can’t, he’s suicidal. Why
don’t you call Oxman and tell him you’ll be there in a few hours.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: You’re crazy. Oxman is leaving in an hour.
If I don’t meet him before then, I blow my 15,000 dollar contract.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh shit, I can’t take this anymore!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Look, maybe we could pawn her off on
Mrs. Razzolini, just for a couple of hours – she’s crazy about her!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Good idea! Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>68 int. building - dusk 68</strong>: Peter and Michael get
out of the elevator on Mrs. Razzolini’s floor. They each are holding one
of the handles on the basket. They are walking quickly. Suddenly Michael
stops Peter.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Wait – I hear someone… I’ll go see…</p>
<p><strong>razzolini</strong>: Yes, I brought a package up to them… I
think it was last Sunday…</p>
<p><strong>agent #1</strong>: What are these people like? What kind of
lifestyle do they have?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Just as I thought – the goddamn cops are
grilling Mrs. Razzolini.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh shit! We sure as hell can’t hand her the
baby with an ass full of dope… right in front of the narcs!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What should we do? I really gotta go…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Listen, she’s just had her bottle. She’s
sleeping like a log. Let’s just leave her in the apartment. What can
possibly happen to her? She’s as regular as clockwork. She won’t wake up
till 8:30 and we’ll easily be back by then…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah, you’re right, we won’t be long.</p>
<p><strong>69 ext. street - dusk 69</strong>: The three men, slumped in
their car, are watching the door of the apartment building.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Michael? Michael, are you here?</p>
<p><strong>71 int. kitchen - night 71</strong>: The debris has been
shoved up against the walls. Peter and Michael, in their pajamas and
dead tired, are slumped over the table. Peter is giving Mary her bottle.
Michael is looking at Mary as though he were seeing her for the first
time.</p>
<p><strong>72 int. peter’s room - night 72</strong>: Peter is in bed,
completely out of it. Michael is changing Mary very carefully. He puts
one diaper on her, then the second one, full of dope. He lays Mary down
in her basket, then places the basket on the bed, nestled between the
wall and Peter’s body. Michael, holding the soiled diaper, silently goes
out. Once he’s alone, Peter leans over the basket. Mary and he stare at
each other intently and seriously. Peter switches off the light.</p>
<p><strong>73 int. apartment - dawn 73</strong>: The DOORBELL RINGS.
Michael, asleep on his mattress on the floor in the middle of his
wrecked bedroom, emerges from sleep and glances at his clock: it’s 6:10
AM. He staggers to the front door and opens it. The door is being held
together with a string. Agents #1, #2, and #3 are at the door, with four
other cops backing them up. Mrs. Razzolini is standing behind them and
staring, wide- eyed, a look of horror on her face.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Morning, officers. Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>agent #1</strong>: Search warrant.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: You’ll have to excuse the mess… We had a
few friends over last night…</p>
<p><strong>agent #1</strong>: Oh, really? Well, if I were you I’d get
myself some new friends!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What the hell are you guys looking for,
anyway?</p>
<p><strong>agent #1</strong>: Probably the same things your friends were
looking for last night! Didn’t Mrs. Razzolini bring you a package last
Sunday?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You mean the chocolate Easter bunnies? We ate
them already.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Anyway, you have no idea how many packages
we’ve been getting lately. It’s hard to keep track of them.</p>
<p><strong>agent #1</strong>: Maybe we can help. Let’s get to work!</p>
<p><strong>74 int. peter’s room - day 74</strong>: Peter is in bed, with
the basket beside him. A narcotics AGENT is rummaging through his
scattered belongings.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Would you mind if I look in your</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: My pleasure. Try not to make a mess.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: I’ll look in the basket, if you don’t
mind…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Be my guest.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Thank you very much, sorry about this…</p>
<p><strong>75 int. apartment - day 75</strong>: The cops are
leaving.</p>
<p><strong>agent #1</strong>: Well, there’s obviously been a mistake. As
far as you’re concerned this investigation is closed. We apologize
again.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Oh, don’t mention it! It was a pleasure
having you here! I hope you’ll find what you’re looking for very
soon!</p>
<p><strong>agent #1</strong>: So do we.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Did you hear that? He said there’d been a
mistake and they weren’t going to bother us anymore.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Bullshit, it’s a trick.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: You think so? Really?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: They just said that to put us off guard. They
saw the condition this apartment’s in.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: They know the punks were here looking for the
dope and that they probably didn’t find it. So that means we’ve still
got it.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: But he said the investigation was
closed.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Okay, let’s just see how closed it is. I’ll
go downstairs. You watch out the window and see if I’m being tailed.</p>
<p><strong>76 ext. street - day 76</strong>: Michael is peeking out at
the street from the window above. Peter comes out of the building and
turns left, walking very quickly. Suddenly, Peter stops, turns around
and retraces his steps. We can clearly see a man, who was walking about
six yards behind Peter on the opposite side of the street, also turn
around and retrace his steps. It is Graton.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: So? Was I right?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: There’s one guy for sure! A redhead, kind
of young, disguised sort of like a college student.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I knew it. They’re going to be watching us
around the clock.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I have the feeling they’ll come to us.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: We’ll have to be very careful.</p>
<p><strong>78 ext. street - nightfall 78</strong>: Michael is walking on
the street carrying two bags of groceries. Suddenly, a guy walks up to
him and elbows him sharply.</p>
<p><strong>punk</strong>: Hi! Doin’ a little shopping, huh? How’s your
place – not too much damage, I hope.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: What do you guys want?</p>
<p><strong>punk</strong>: We want the dope. Tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: And we want to give it to you. But the cops
are tailing us nonstop. Matter of fact, there’s one right behind us
now…</p>
<p><strong>punk</strong>: That’s your problem, man. Figure out a way to
shake ’em. Either we safely get the dope tomorrow, or you, your friend
and the kid’ll get this. We’ll call you tonight.</p>
<p><strong>79 int. cop car - night 79</strong>: Not far from Peter,
Michael and Jack’s building, Graton, in his car, is talking into the
microphone of his police radio.</p>
<p><strong>graton</strong>: … My snitch told me the gang hasn’t gotten
the dope back yet, but they will soon. They made contact with the two
guys tonight … No, no, they don’t know I’m tailing them. These jerks are
going to fall right into my hands…</p>
<p><strong>80 int. apartment - night 80</strong>: Peter and Michael are
seated in the living room, which is still an utter wreck. They can’t
take their eyes off the phone that’s between the two of them.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Hello? Who? Goddamn it, where are you?… …
It’s Jack. He just landed in Newark. He came back early.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Gimme that. Jack? What the hell are you
doing? Yeah… yeah… oh yeah? Well, listen very carefully, Jack. That
wonderful, fantastic babe you brought back from Bolivia? The one you’re
gonna marry tomorrow? Well, you’re not going to bring her here!… You are
going to say ‘goodbye’ to her very nicely and put her in a cab back to
Bolivia… Why? Because there’s another wonderful, fantastic babe waiting
for you right here at home … Who is she? Oh, that’s a surprise! You’ll
see when you get here. But believe me, she’s</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Make it quick, the punks may be trying to
call…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: So hurry home, Jack, this little doll can’t
wait to see you. ’Bye.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: That goddamn mother fuckin’ jerk of an
asshole! I swear when he comes through the door I’ll kill him! I’ll…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Hello? Listen, tomorrow, Central Park at
the fountain near the merry-go-round, five o’clock. Be there, but…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: … That was it.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: All we can do now is hope our plan works.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: You think the cops have our phone
bugged?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I don’t think that’s legal, is it?</p>
<p><strong>80a ext. street - night 80a</strong>: Graton is speaking into
the microphone of his radio. Next to him sits a cop with phone-tapping
equipment.</p>
<p><strong>graton</strong>: We got ’em, Chief. Five o’clock</p>
<p><strong>81 int. apartment - night 81</strong>: Jack emerges from the
elevator happy as a lark and feeling frisky.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yoo-hoo, guys! I’m home! I’ve got presents for
you… so where’s that wonderful fantastic babe…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: … What the hell happened here?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Peter! Michael! Are you here?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Oh, my God! My beautiful room! My beautiful,
beautiful room! Michael!… Peter – where the hell are you, for
Chrissakes?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What the hell is going on around here? What
happened to this place? What happened to my room?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: And anyway, what the hell are you</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Oh, I get it. The ‘silent’ treatment! Okay, if
you won’t talk to me, you can talk to my lawyer! This is grounds for
divorce! You’re in big trouble, the both of you.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I paid to have this place decorated, too, you
know. I’m not going to let you get away with this.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It’s too late to try and talk me out of it.
I’m history. I’m gone. I’m outa here.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m giving you one more chance to…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Would it be asking too much of you to shut
your big mouth for a few seconds? There is a child here who’s trying to
sleep.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: And that’s another thing! I will not have a
baby in this house! Babies are not part of our agreement!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Michael, please hold me back… or I’ll kill
him.</p>
<p><strong>82 int. living room - night 82</strong>: Michael sits Jack
down in an armchair. He speaks with forced calm.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: All right, Jack. Why don’t we start at the
very beginning. The very day you left for your vacation…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hey, will you please stop talking like
Mr. Rogers? It’s getting on my nerves.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: His nerves! Ha. Ha. Ha. His nerves! Michael,
his nerves! You wanna talk about nerves! Then just shut up and listen.
It so happens we don’t want a kid here either, but when someone dumps
one on us, we take goddamn care of it.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Yeah, we take goddam care of it.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: We haven’t had a decent night’s sleep in two
weeks. Michael’s probably going to lose a $15,000 contract…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Peter couldn’t leave. Jerry almost jumped
out the window. It’s lucky they even made it to the finals!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: First, we’ve got the narcs on our ass, then
there’s the drug gang threatening to carve us up. Then bottles… bottles…
every three hours, bottles.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: And diapers. Have you ever tried to do
diapers?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: ‘La Paz, Bolivia…’ He calls from … ‘I’m onto
something hot.’ He says. ‘Did the package get there?’ He says. You
asshole!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: And the day they wrecked the apartment,
Peter came home and couldn’t find Mary. I’ve never seen him in tears
like that bef…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Never mind about that. Look, Jack, you got us
into this mess, and you’re going to help us get out of it.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What are you guys talking about? What narcs?
What gang? And who’s that fucking baby?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: For your information, the ‘fucking’ baby’s
name is Mary. And if I were you, I’d watch what I said about her…
because she just so happens to be your daughter!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What??</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: And it just so happens, we’ve got a lot
better things to do with our lives than wipe a baby’s ass, even if she’s
yours!</p>
<p><strong>83 int. bathroom - day 83</strong>: Peter is slicking his
hair back with Brylcream. Jack is sitting on the edge of the bathtub,
with his arms crossed. He observes Peter silently.</p>
<p><strong>84 int. apartment - michael’s room - day 84</strong>: Mary is
lying on the bed and Michael is putting the dope- filled diaper on
her.</p>
<p><strong>85 int. bathroom - day 85</strong>: Peter is giving a
tousled-looking punk hairstyle to Jack, who is looking at himself in the
mirror.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It’s ridiculous. I look ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You look completely ridiculous – so what?</p>
<p><strong>87 ext. street - day 87</strong>: Michael exits the building.
Mary, wrapped in a little woolen blanket, is in his arms. Michael is
also carry- ing his plastic bag. Graton, in his car, is speaking into
the radio mike.</p>
<p><strong>graton</strong>: Okay, he’s coming out alone. I’ll follow
him. Someone else stay here to keep an eye on the other guys.</p>
<p><strong>88 ext. central park - day 88</strong>: Michael is lying on
the grass near the fountain with Mary on her blanket near him. Graton is
nearby, also lying casually on the grass, watching them out of the
corner of his eye. Michael glances at his watch, then at the passersby.
The punk from the day before walks by with his arm around a girl. He
strolls by casually. He spots Michael and their eyes meet. The couple
sit down on a bench a few yards away and they begin “making out.”</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>graton</strong>: Inspector Graton, Narcotics. Do you admit
you gave these men this package?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Sure. I gave it to them, just a moment
ago.</p>
<p><strong>graton</strong>: Officer, will you please open this package
in front of these witnesses?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Is it against the law to give a box of
candy to my friends?</p>
<p><strong>graton</strong>: Oh, it’s you guys!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What’s the problem?</p>
<p><strong>graton</strong>: You guys must think you’re pretty smart,
don’t ya? Holy shit! The diaper!</p>
<p><strong>graton</strong>: The goddam diaper! What a jerk, what a
goddam schmuck I am!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I think that guy needs a vacation.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: He should try South America.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah, I hear it’s nice there this time of
year.</p>
<p><strong>89 int. graton’s boss’s office - day 89</strong>: The Chief
is standing behind his desk, red-faced with anger, and Graton sheepishly
faces him.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Let’s face it… Graton… You’ve got shit for
brains.</p>
<p><strong>graton</strong>: I’m sure the dope was in the diaper. Can I
go on tailing them?</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Forget it. I have solid information your
three suspects never had anything to do with the dealers or the
dope.</p>
<p><strong>graton</strong>: I’m sure the dope was in the diaper.</p>
<p><strong>graton</strong>: I’m sure the dope was in the diaper.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Did you hear me, Graton? Case closed.</p>
<p><strong>graton</strong>: I’m sure the d…</p>
<p><strong>90 int. apartment living room - evening 90</strong>: In the
devastated living room Peter, still disguised as a punk, and Michael,
both very high, are dancing around in circles with each other and
laughing. They are singing a lullaby at the top of their lungs, and har-
monizing. Peter is holding Mary close, and Michael, holding a near-empty
bottle of liquor, staggers over to him and starts turning around in
circles with him. MARY, snuggled up warmly between Peter and Michael, is
LAUGHING her head off. In the b.g., in the hall, Jack, also still in his
punk getup, is on the phone. He’s got a glass in his hand and is a
little smashed.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Paul, hi, it’s Jack! Hey, listen, I brought
you back a little present from South America. Can I see you right away
so I can give it to you? … Yeah, the sooner the better! I can’t wait to
let you have it. How about 67th and East River?</p>
<p><strong>91 ext. east river - evening 91</strong>: A broadly smiling
Jack arrives at the riverside. Paul is sitting on a bench. When he sees
Jack, he gets up and comes to greet him, smiling and extending his hand.
Without warning, Jack suddenly jumps him and sends him with a forceful
shove flying into the water. Paul lands on his back with a big splash,
and comes back up to the surface totally dumbfounded. Jack leans over
the water and yells at him, like a madman, still a bit drunk.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: That was for your ‘little’ package, and
consider yourself lucky I didn’t turn you in to the cops! And get one
thing into your thick skull: I have never touched dope,</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hey, come back! – how’m I gonna get out of
here?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Crawl.</p>
<p><strong>92 int. apartment - day 92</strong>: In the living room,
Michael is sitting in front of the TV. He’s not really watching – he’s
eavesdropping on Jack’s phone conversation.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Listen, Sylvia, you’ve got to come back. I
travel, I can’t take care of her… Yeah, but you’re her mother… I’m her
father – what makes you so sure I’m the father!? The dates coincide! Big
deal! That doesn’t prove a thing… But she’s still your kid, so do me a
favor, get your ass back here immediately and take her off our hands…
’Cause we’ve got a lot better things to do with our lives than wipe a
baby’s ass, okay? Sylvia?… Hello! Hello! Sylvia, goddam it!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: down like he was</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Why don’t you call her back?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I don’t have the number. I got a message to
her through her agency, they won’t tell me where she is. I don’t even
know where she was calling from. And you better believe she’s not
going</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Hello?… No, it’s Michael… How are you?… Oh,
she’s doing just fine, she’s in great shape. We’re taking very good care
of her, you have nothing to worry about. ’Bye.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Who was that?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Sylvia – She wanted to know how Mary was
doing.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What? Jesus Christ, Michael, why didn’t you
let me talk to her!?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: She would have just hung up on you again.
The important thing is she knows Mary’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You jerk! You should’ve said she was terrible,
sick as hell! Practically on death’s door! What a jerk, what a pain in
the ass you can be sometimes…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: What’s with him? The kid’s doing really
great!</p>
<p><strong>93 int. apartment - morning 93</strong>: Jack is on the phone
in his room, which is looking a little more normal again.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Mom? Hi, how are you?… Yes, I’m fine. Yes, I’m
eating well. Mom, how would you feel if I told you you were a
grandma?…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: … Yeah… A little girl, Mary…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: … I’d love you to see her. In fact, I was
gonna bring her down tomorrow… today?… Great, I think there’s a flight
in three hours. I’ll be at your place by two. See you real soon!</p>
<p><strong>94 int. kitchen - day 94</strong>: Michael and Jack are in
the kitchen. Michael is making some bottles. Jack is watching him do
it.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: You’ll have four already made, this’ll hold
till Miami.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Okay…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Tell her to make sure Mary gets plenty of
sleep.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’ll tell her.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: If her ass gets red, tell her not to listen
to any pediatricians – they’re full of shit.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Right. Full of shit.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Then she should give her a bottle of water
instead of the regular bottle. Works like a charm: Her ass will be white
as snow in three hours.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Bottle of water, white as snow…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Peter says her clothes should be washed by
hand…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Really, by hand?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: And only in soap flakes without any
artificial color or scent. And then rinsed three times in very hot
water.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Rinse three times.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: To put her to sleep we sing in harmony – it
always works.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: My mother lives alone.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Solo works just as well.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Now, as for the nipples, you’ve got to be
very, very, very careful.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: As soon as the hole gets too big she’s
gotta throw them out – This is extra, extra, extra-specially important –
’cause if the hole’s too big, the milk comes out too fast and it’s bad
for her digest…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I gotta get going, I’ll miss my plane…</p>
<p><strong>95 int. apartment - day 95</strong>: Peter is returning from
work.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Anyone home?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I am!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: How ’bout Jack?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: On his way to Miami.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh, yeah. He’s got a lot of nerve! Leaving us
with the kid again…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: No, he took Mary to his mother’s, she
couldn’t wait to see her. He’s gonna try to unload her on her till
Sylvia gets back. I made her four bott…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You’re kidding! That son-of-a- bitch!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Don’t worry, I told him everything he had
to know, and I made her four bott…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh, I’m telling you, that guy is really
starting to get on my nerves!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Goddamn him! He really could have called
me!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Are you pissed off ’cause she’s gone?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Of course not! What, are you crazy? I’m
relieved! Thank God she’s out of here!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I made her four bott…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Four bottles for the goddam trip. There, I
finally got it out.</p>
<p><strong>96 ext. house - day 96</strong>: A cab slowly pulls up in
front of Jack’s mother’s house. There is a big red convertible filled
with four jovial senior citizens. Jack comes out of the cab with the
basket and stares at his mother, MARGIE, who’s just locking her door.
Next to her, holding her luggage is Steve . They head toward the trunk
of the car.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hey, Mom!</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: Hey, he finally made it!</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: Do you have any idea what time it is? It’s
four. You said two.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: But, Mom, I missed the plane.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: Yeah, but now I have to go.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: On a cruise around the world.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: But why didn’t you say so on the phone?</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: Because you never would’ve come. Now let me
see her. Oh, my little strudle!</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: Bye-bye, sweetie love… I’ll bring you back
presents from all over the world. Four o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: ’Bye!</p>
<p><strong>97 int. apartment - night 97</strong>: Jack comes in with the
basket; he’s in a vile mood. He’s got a bottle ready in his hand. Peter,
who had been working in his room, rushes to the hall.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You’re bringing her back?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah… she’s starving. I gotta heat this bottle
up right away.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: So what happened? Did you two have a
fight?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Goddamn cruises…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Didn’t she want to take her?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Sure she did, but she was just leaving for
some stupid cruise around the world. The entire fucking world! With some
bimbo boyfriend of her’s… and a bunch of retired bozos.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>98 int. apartment - late afternoon 98</strong>: The DOORBELL
RINGS. Jack goes to the door. At the door stands a rather
distinguished-looking woman, with her hair tied back very properly, a
suitcase in her hand. It is MRS. BRETSAWS, who speaks with a British
accent.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bretsaws</strong>: Good afternoon. I’m Mathilda
Bretsaws, from The Second Mommy agency.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Oh, yes, I was expecting you. Won’t you come
in…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Must be some nanny he found through an
agency.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: She wants to see Mary.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: She’s asleep.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well, she wants to see her anyway!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Nothing, nothing.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Don’t go into my room, she’s asleep.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah, but the nanny, Mrs. Bretsaws, she wants
to see her.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No, damn it, no! You’re gonna wake her up! It
already took me an hour to sing her to sleep…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah, but she wants to see her.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: All right, I’ll go explain the situation.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No, no, Peter, please, really, don’t go, don’t
bother, I’ll go explain it to her myself…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: It’s no bother, Jack. I’ll be glad to do
it.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Wanna bet she’s out of here in ten minutes
slamming the door behind her?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: … A sleeping child should not be awakened. If
you don’t know that, then you’re not fit to be a nanny.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bretsaws</strong>: I never said that I wanted the child
to be awakened, sir. I only asked to see her. If I’m going to be taking
care of the child on a round-the-clock basis, then…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: ‘Round-the-clock’? Whaddya mean ‘round the
clock’? Are you intending to sleep here?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bretsaws</strong>: Absolutely, sir. A second mommy is a
second mommy.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: And where are you going to sleep?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bretsaws</strong>: Well, I expect you to show me to my
quarters.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Well, I don’t know where Jack intends to
stick you… That’s his problem… Maybe in his room… But I’m warning you,
Mrs. Brestshow.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bretsaws</strong>: Bretsaws.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: There are three of us sharing this place and
we’re all real studs.</p>
<p><strong>100 int. hallway - late afternoon 100</strong>: Behind the
door, Jack rolls his eyes, Michael empathizes with him. They head back
to the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bretsaws</strong>: … And as for screwing, I have all I
need at home, thank you very much. With a few days off every month, I’m
sure I’ll be fine. The only thing I’m interested in is the care of the
child and I can tell she needs some.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh, yeah? How do you figure that?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bretsaws</strong>: Shouldn’t I be discussing all this
with the father?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Well, listen, Mrs. Fretsaw, umm…
Brainsore…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bretsaws</strong>: Bretsaws, Mrs. Bretsaws.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Right… Bratsnot, lemme tell you something.
With a child you always know who the mother is, but the father – that’s
another kettle of fish. So don’t give me that bullshit, okay?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bretsaws</strong>: Very well. I won’t discuss it any
further with you. Will you please show me where the kitchen and the
bathroom are?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bretsaws</strong>: So I can make you a list of the
things we need.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What do you mean, make you a list? – Don’t
you do the shopping yourself?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bretsaws</strong>: No shopping or laundry or
housekeeping. I am a professional nanny.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: We have plenty of everything.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bretsaws</strong>: Do you have a sufficient amount of
fruit and vegetables for the child?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: She only eats milk and cereal.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bretsaws</strong>: That’s not enough, sir. From the age
of three months children should be started on a normal, varied diet.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh that’s bullshit. You don’t feed a baby
like an adult.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bretsaws</strong>: Oh, really? And how would you
know?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’ve read plenty of books. The diet
recommended by those quack pediatricians today is way too rich. I’m in
favor of natural methods, Mrs. Breathmint.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bretsaws</strong>: Bretsaws, Mrs. Bretsaws.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: For instance, if a child is having trouble
getting to sleep, what would you do?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bretsaws</strong>: Depends, if it was a continuing
problem, I might recommend a mild sedative…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I knew you’d say something like that, you
jerk!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bretsaws</strong>: Fine. Anything you say, sir. Let me
just remind you that I have my diploma and that medicine is a serious
matter.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Do you know the song that goes ‘Medicine’s a
whore and the pharmacist is her pimp’?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bretsaws</strong>: No, I don’t. We must listen to
different music. Personally I’m very fond of opera.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Mrs. Breakballs, if you don’t get out of here
right this minute I’m gonna punch you in the nose! This is my home, now
get out!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bretsaws</strong>: The name’s Bretsaws. I am blessed
with infinite patience when it comes to children, sir, but I’m not
qualified to deal with lunatics. Goodbye and good luck!</p>
<p><strong>102 int. kitchen - late afternoon 102</strong>: Michael and
Jack are sitting at the table.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What did I tell you? Ten minutes to the
second!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Okay, listen, you guys… I’ve tried everything
and nothing’s working: my mother’s off on a cruise; Mrs. Razzolini won’t
speak to us ever since the whole business with the cops – we don’t want
to involve any of our girlfriends; Sylvia’s taking it easy in Europe and
there’s no way she’s gonna come back now that Michael went and told her
everything’s just fine and dandy. Peter did a terrific job getting rid
of Mrs. Bretsaws, and all that’s left are the daycare centers, but
Peter’s positive they’re a breeding pit for A.I.D.S. So you tell me:
What are we suppose to do? You want me to split with the kid? Or dump
her in an orphanage?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Look, her mother’ll be back in less than
five months. Let’s not waste a shitload of time looking for a solution
for such a short time. Let’s get organized.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What do you mean, organized?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Well, you’ll have to ask to fly the New
York-Washington shuttle for five months, on account of serious personal
problems.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What? Never! I’d rather be a subway
conductor.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Then dump her in an orphanage, ’cause there’s
no way we’re gonna take care of her all by ourselves anymore!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Come on, stop arguing, you two! Jack,
you’re going to have to ask to do the New York-Washington shu…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No! Never.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: That way, you can do the 6-10 A.M. shift.
That amounts to two bottles and two diaper changes. You do the shopping
when you get home in the evening and that’s all. Peter, you’ll take the
6-10 P.M. shift. That’s two bottles and two diaper changes, her bath and
her laundry. Since I work at home I’ll take the longest shift from 10
A.M. to 6 P.M. I’ll take her to the park for an hour, but that’s it. No
shopping, no cooking, no cleaning.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What if she gets up at night?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Well… I thought you might do it…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Not a chance! I’m not doing the night shift.
I absolutely refuse. I have too much work to catch up on for the
competition.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well, needless to say I refuse, too!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Listen to me, you selfish bastards! My
shift is eight hours in a row. No way I’m gonna do nights too. After 6
P.M. she can scream all she wants, I don’t give a shit.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You know, Jack, you’re a real slime ball! We
give you the easiest shift: the morning. She’s always in great shape in
the morning, isn’t she? We’ve got to work like crazy to save our jobs
and you have the nerve to refuse nights. Goddamit, she’s your daughter.
Are you that horny?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hey, horny yourself! I don’t give a shit. I
don’t need you guys. I’ll find some other way to do it. And I won’t take
the New York-Washington shuttle!</p>
<p><strong>104 int. charter company - day 104</strong>: Jack is coming
out of an office that says “EXECUTIVE OFFICES.” He is grim and
sullen-looking. He runs into his friend Paul, who jumps three feet away
to avoid a potential mishap with Jack.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hi, Jack, something wrong?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Oh, hi… Nah, nothing’s wrong.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What were you doing in the boss’s office?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I was asking to do the New York- Washington
shuttle for a few months.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Oh, and he said ‘no,’ huh?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: As a matter of fact, he said ‘yes.’</p>
<p><strong>105 int. jack’s room - night 105</strong>: Jack is sitting on
his bed, wearing a dressing gown. He’s got a sleeping Mary in his arms.
The basket is on the floor beside the bed. Jack attempts to put Mary
back in her basket but she shudders and he immediately sits back down
again and doesn’t move. Mary falls back asleep. Jack looks at her skin,
her hands. Very gently, he kisses her forehead. Mary smiles in her
sleep.</p>
<p><strong>106 int. michael’s room - morning 106</strong>: Michael is
working at his drafting table. Jack rushes in, wearing his uniform,
ready to go out.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Okay, I’m off. She’s well fed and she’s
sleeping now.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Shit, she’s crying. I’ll go pick her up…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No, she needs to burp – I’ve gotta rock her
for a little…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’m telling you, the more you pick her up,
the longer it’ll take her to get to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Thanks for the advice – now why don’t you just
shove it? I know you let her scream for hours but I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I never let her scream for hours!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You’d resort to any theory to not take care of
her. Just because you’ve read some books…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Can you believe what he just said to me… I
read those books bec…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It’s not your shift, anyway. Piss off, will
ya?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Come on, guys, cool it! It’s my shift now.
I’ll rock her for a few minutes… … and then I’ll put her right to bed.
So off to work, both of you.</p>
<p><strong>1076 int. apartment - day 107</strong>: It’s noon, the sun is
shining brightly. Michael is diapering Mary on her changing table. She’s
naked. He tickles her, bites her toes, neck and ears; she bursts out
laughing. Michael is totally gaga over her.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Coochie, coochie, coo… woo, woo, woo…
bippity, boppity boo…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hi, Michael, I just came back to get a file I
forgot…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Everything okay?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Yeah, okay.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Well, I guess I’ll be going now.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: The baby okay?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Yeah, okay.</p>
<p><strong>108 int. bathroom - evening 108</strong>: Peter enters the
bathroom. He’s carrying Mary, who’s naked and wrapped in a towel.</p>
<p><strong>109 same scene - months later 109</strong>: Peter is wearing
a different suit and Mary is almost one-year-old, with a lot more hair
on her head, and able to sit up a lot better.</p>
<p><strong>110 int. jack’s room - night 110</strong>: Although it is
dark, we can distinguish in Jack’s bed a rather bulky shape, which is
moving around under the comforter and doesn’t exactly seem to be
sleeping… Suddenly, from the direction of the living room, we can hear
MARY CRYING. Jack emerges from under the comforter and switches on the
light: he has a female guest in his bed, a pretty BRUNETTE this
time.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Shit, she’s crying…</p>
<p><strong>brunette</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Nothing, nothing. I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It’ beddy-bye time now, honey, beddy-bye,
don’t cry, sweetheart…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: She’s crying.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah, every time I try to put her back to
bed…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Maybe she’s thirsty?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No, her back teeth must be starting to bother
her…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What should I do?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I’ve bought some stuff for her gums.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Try and put her back to bed; we’ll sing.</p>
<p><strong>111 int. jack’s room - night 111</strong>: The Brunette is
listening to the male chorus, totally amazed.</p>
<p><strong>brunette</strong>: This guy’s totally whacko.</p>
<p><strong>brunette</strong>: Hey, choir boys, you gonna keep it up all
night?</p>
<p><strong>brunette</strong>: Oh my God! There’s a baby in there! I’m
sorry…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Who the hell’s that broad?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Watch your mouth, will you? I’m in love with
that young lady.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Can’t she speak softly like everyone
else?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Listen, at night I’m in charge. So get off my
back, will you?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Will you quit fighting all the time? She
just fell asleep, for Chrissake.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Oh, Michael, go to hell! I’m sick and tired of
your little ‘Father Knows Best’ number!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah, you’re right, I’m fed up with it,
too!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Okay, that’s it. Into the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I’ve had it with you assholes! I won’t be
the buffer between you two anymore…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I didn’t ask you to get up, I know what I have
to do.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I don’t mind getting up, that’s not the
point…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I’m not a punching bag! You assholes!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: If I can’t bring a girl back here anymore,
just say so. And I’m gone. I’m outta here. With Mary.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You can bring whoever you want as long as
they speak softly like everyone else!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: One thing I know: I can’t goddamn wait till
Sylvia gets back!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah, you can say that again!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: And again, and again, and again…</p>
<p><strong>brunette</strong>: Sorry to disturb you guys, but I’m
splitting. I didn’t come here to be a bedwarmer. ’Bye.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No! Wait, please don’t go… it’s all over now,
I’m coming back to bed…</p>
<p><strong>112 int. apartment - night 112</strong>: Peter, Michael and
Jack have guests over for dinner. CLASSICAL MUSIC, a very fancy table,
candles: they’re at the tail-end of the dinner, before dessert. Everyone
is very fashionably dressed.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Have you seen the latest bi-annual at the
Whitney? Incredible! Have you seen it, Peter?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No, I haven’t had the time lately.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Ah… working hard on the competition, are you?
You may as well throw in the T-square, old friend, you haven’t got a
chance.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I only wish he was working hard on the
competition, but unfortunately, that’s not the case…</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Really? What’s he doing then? He’s always
so busy.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Maybe he’s working hard on women! Some people
have to work really hard to get anything!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Why do you always have to bring Carl along
with you?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Don’t you like him?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh, c’mon – I love him! Only, I’d like to see
you alone for once, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: He’s extremely talented – in fact, I hate
to tell you this, but I think he and his group are gonna win the
competition.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Well, we’ll see about that.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Did you give her something to drink?</p>
<p><strong>christie</strong>: Oh, cut it out! No more for me! I’ve had
eight glasses!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I tried, but she doesn’t want anything –</p>
<p><strong>christie</strong>: I do so want some, but if I have anymore
I’ll pass out!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Save room for dessert – it’s a three-tiered
cake from Balducci’s!</p>
<p><strong>christie</strong>: I love three-tiered cakes!</p>
<p><strong>jay’s wife</strong>: So what’s it made of?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Umm, it’s made with whipped cream and loads
of nipples on top – I mean, loads of… raspberries … I’ll be right
back…</p>
<p><strong>sophia</strong>: Are you saying that’s not art? Are you
really saying that’s not art? Well, then, you explain what it is.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Well, it’s… art. I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Jack, tell me about those exotic places,
what is Caracas like?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well, actually… uh, lately I’ve been to
Washington a lot… and uh… I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>113 int. peter’s room - night 113</strong>: The three men are
talking. Jack is holding Mary, whose eyes are swollen with tears.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Try and put her back to bed…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m warning you, she’ll scream…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’m sure she’s cutting a tooth…</p>
<p><strong>christie</strong>: Yoo-hoo! What are you guys doing in there?
It’s fucking boring without you…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Oh shit – the guests…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You two go… I’m staying with her. It can’t be
worse than listening to Carl.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: That’s not fair – let’s take Mary out
there…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: And the hell with it.</p>
<p><strong>114 int. apartment - night 114</strong>: The three men enter
the living room; Jack is carrying Mary.</p>
<p><strong>guests</strong>: Oh, it’s a baby!</p>
<p><strong>guests</strong>: Where the hell did that come from? Wow! Is
it a boy or a girl? Who does it belong to? So you’ve got a kid now?
Incredible! Does that come from Balducci’s? No kidding, whose baby is
that?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen, I would like you to meet
my daughter, Mary.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Your daughter… your daughter…</p>
<p><strong>guests</strong>: You’re kidding! Congratulations! She’s
adorable! She looks just like you… Oh, what a cute little girl!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Don’t cry, Mary, don’t cry…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: There’s too much noise.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: She’s teething, that’s why she’s cranky. Give
her to me, I’ll try and calm her down.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Don’t sit down – it’ll get worse. You have
to walk around.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: How long have you had this kid?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: A few months…</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Who’s her mother, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: She’s in Europe, she’ll be back in a few
days.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Does she always cry like that?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: No, it’s only because she’s teething, she’s
usually very sweet…</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: What if you just put her back to bed?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Right – she’s just throwing a temper
tantrum, put her to bed…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: We already tried…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It’s her teeth…</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Do you have any kids?</p>
<p><strong>jerry’s wife</strong>: Yeah, but they’re grown up now, thank
God!</p>
<p><strong>christie</strong>: And do you have kids, too?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>christie</strong>: I said… and do you have kids, too?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: No, we both have careers.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: So, do you think we’ll get to taste that
three-tiered cake tonight?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Oh, nothing, nothing – I was just trying to
liven up the</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>christie</strong>: Gosh, my ears are ringing, I can’t hear
anybody.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: I must say, a crying kid is kind of hard
to take…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: We were just saying that this baby’s
conversation is actually rather limited… and a touch annoying. Don’t you
think?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Well, she’s not the only one with a limited
conversation. At least she has an excuse, she’s a baby! What’s
yours?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I frankly don’t know what you mean.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I mean, I’ve been listening to your pompous
drivel about the latest trends for the last two hours, and frankly, it’s
a crock of horseshit.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Come on, Peter, be nice…</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Listen, go put the baby to bed and you guys
cool it, will you?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: It’s okay. I’m used to it. Peter’s always been
a sore loser.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You motherfucker, get out of here! Get out of
my house right now or I’ll kick the shit out</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Peter, cut it out!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Stop it, Peter. Give her to me, I’ll put her
to bed…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No, I’ll go. And you can all go fuck
yourselves! Go back to your asinine conversations!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Well… umm… How ’bout if I get the cake now,
okay?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Well. It seems our beloved hosts are going to
be busy playing mother for a while, so if you’ll excuse me, I’ll just
slip away… … Natalie, may I invite you to spend the rest of the evening
in a more hospitable place?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Gladly. Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Is he out of his mind or what?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: He was absolutely obnoxious.</p>
<p><strong>christie</strong>: Hey, Caroline, I think we should</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Oh, God, no! Hold it back!</p>
<p><strong>christie</strong>: I wanna go home…</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Okay, we’re going… Sorry… say goodbye to
Jack for us…</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Look, there’s no point in our staying any
longer. I think it’s best we leave.</p>
<p><strong>jay’s wife</strong>: Tell Peter if was a wonderful party.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Okay… ’Bye…</p>
<p><strong>sophia</strong>: Can you drop me off near Soho by any
chance?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>sophia</strong>: Thanks! ’Bye… Say goodbye to them for
me…</p>
<p><strong>jerry’s wife</strong>: Well, we might as well go, too. I
think the evening’s over.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Ta-da! Will you look at this? Is this a
cake or what? Can someone make a little room on the table so I can… Are
you guys leaving?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Yeah, we’re beat.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Hey, where is everybody?</p>
<p><strong>jerry’s wife</strong>: Well, the atmosphere wasn’t exactly
festive…</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Sorry about the cake, Mike… It looks
great!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Oh, never mind, don’t worry… Good
night…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well, she’s asleep at last! We sang in har…
Hey, where is everybody?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Gone. Can you make a little room for me on
the table to put the…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You mean they’re all gone?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Yeah, all of ’em, hey, can you make a
little room for me to…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Peter! Peter, goddamit, get out here!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: They’re all gone!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Who gives a shit, they’re all jerks
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Hey, could you make a little room for me on
the table so I can…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It’s because of the kid. They can’t stand
kids.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I can’t stand kids either but that’s not a
reason to leave! Dipshits, they’re all a bunch of dipshits, every one of
’em.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Oh, fuck it – I’m sitting down.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: And did you hear Natalie: ‘She’s throwing a
temper tantrum, just put her to bed.’ What a pain-in- the-ass that broad
is!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hey, you’re the pain-in-the-ass! First you
dump a baby on us, then you scare everyone away from the party,
then…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I scared everyone aw… Just cut the crap, will
you? My whole life is diapers, shuttles and bottles. I do the graveyard
shift, I’m the one who never gets any sleep. I…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Listen, we all have two full-time jobs!
That’s for sure!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: And what about me? I’m a prisoner in this
house all day long, forget about chasing ass, I haven’t gotten laid in
six months. When the hell is your friggin’ Sylvia gonna come back?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: She’s been gone for six months and four
days.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: If she’s not back by the end of next week,
I’m kicking her kid out!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: You better give your goddam Sylvia hell for
this!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Don’t worry, she’s gonna get it but good!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: And you can tell her we have a lot better
things to do with our lives than wipe a baby’s ass, goddamn it!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Do you guys want some cake? Guys?</p>
<p><strong>115 int. apartment - night 115</strong>: In her crib Mary is
sleeping. She’s beautiful, she looks happy.</p>
<p><strong>116 int. living room - day 116</strong>: Mary is in her
playpen, playing with a SQUEAKY rubber giraffe. The DOORBELL RINGS.
Peter opens it: standing there before him is a very, very, young,
gorgeous girl.</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: Hello… I’m Sylvia, Mary’s mother. I’ve come
to get her…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh, it’s you… Wait, I’ll go</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: How’s Mary doing?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Fine, fine, she’s doing great… She’s getting
her back teeth in lately, it’s been a bit rough…</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: Can I see her?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh, yeah, sure, she’s in there…</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: I don’t believe how much she’s grown!</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: Hello, Mary, hello my darling…</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: How beautiful she is… Her hair has grown…
Look how much she changed, I missed it all. I missed her so much!</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: I wanted to make life difficult for Jack but
I never thought I’d miss her so much…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh, yeah… make life difficult for Jack…</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: Is he here?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: Is Jack here?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh, yeah, yeah, I’ll go get him…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Michael, Michael… Sylvia’s here.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Mary’s leaving.</p>
<p><strong>117 int. kitchen - day 117</strong>: Peter’s giving Mary her
bottle, Jack is carefully putting all her stuff into a bag – bottles,
nipples, cereals, etc. In the doorway Sylvia, with reddened eyes,
silently watches them.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Let’s see, the five bottles, the little
bottles for water, the strainer for her cereal… … Do you have a
blender?</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: A blender?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: For bananas and carrots and stuff. It’s time
for her to start eating them…</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: No, I don’t have a blender.</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: Do you want me to take her?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No, I have to burp her first.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Here, could you give these to Michael so he
can pack them with the clothes?</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: Here are the bibs. Jack told me to give
them…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Thanks… I put the woolen things on the
bottom and the diapers and lighter things on top, because you’ll need
those first…</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: Yeah, sure…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: You’ll have to come back and get the crib
later.</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>118 ext. street - day 118</strong>: A taxi is there. Behind
the wheel the driver sits waiting. Sylvia is sitting in the back, on the
side nearest the sidewalk, and on her lap is Mary, whom she’s gently
fondling. On the sidewalk, beside the open trunk of the cab, are all
Mary’s belongings: some bags, the playpen, a stroller, the baby bathtub,
the changing table, etc. Peter is attempting to pack it all in the
trunk. Michael is handing the things to him.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Give me the playpen first…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Then where are you gonna put the tub?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Just give me the playpen.</p>
<p><strong>cab driver</strong>: Need some help?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No, no thanks… I’d rather do it myself…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You really screwed us over but good – you know
that…</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: I know, I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Really. Our lives have been out of control for
the past six months.</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: Yeah, I bet… Actually, that was kind of the
point… But I’m the one who really got screwed…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Don’t cry, c’mon… you’re taking her back now,
it’s great…</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: Yeah, it’s great…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: D’you have enough money? Can you manage all
right?</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: Yeah, sure… I’m not loaded, but it’s okay –
I’m working, I’ve got modeling jobs lined up…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Do you have a boyfriend?</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: No. That’s the last thing I need. I’ve got
my work. And now I’ve got her.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: That’s it, we fit it all in…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Okay, then… well, ’bye…</p>
<p><strong>peter, michael and jack</strong>: ’Bye, Mary!</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: Okay, well, thanks again – ’Bye!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well, that’s that!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Right… That’s that.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh shit – I forgot to explain about the
cereal!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: She’ll figure it out by herself…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Yeah, she’ll manage…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Now it’s back to the good life for us!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Sleeping late! Different women every night!
I can’t wait!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Forget about the New York-Washington shuttle!
I’m off to Caracas!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: And I’m gonna be able to get back to work, so
Carl better watch it – I’m gonna slaughter that son-of-a-bitch! First
with this goddam competition… and then with Natalie.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: And I’ve got six months’ worth of sex to
catch up on with Cathy, Nora, Frances, Susan, Barbra…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: …Christie, Paula, Sheila, Lisa, Kimberly,
Rhonda, Rebecca, Louisa…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh, she forgot her squeaky giraffe.</p>
<p><strong>119 ext. luxury hotel - day 119</strong>: Jack takes a
running jump and does a cannonball into the pool of a luxury hotel
somewhere in the world. He splashes two girls who find it very
funny…</p>
<p><strong>120 ext. street - day 120</strong>: Peter, with a bouquet of
flowers, runs like mad down a street.</p>
<p><strong>121 int. art gallery - day 121</strong>: Michael and Sophia
are having a big discussion about contemporary art in the midst of a
sophisticated crowd at an opening. Michael is vehement, gesturing
wildly, and so is Sophia. They’re both talking at once, not listening to
each other, and enjoying it immensely.</p>
<p><strong>122 int. office - day 122</strong>: Peter, all out of breath,
comes rushing into the office where Natalie works. She is very
surprised. He puts the flowers down on her desk.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: These are for you… I’m not supposed to leave
the office.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: They think I’m in the bathroom. So I can’t
stay. ’Bye.</p>
<p><strong>123 ext. airport - day 123</strong>: Jack is running on the
tarmac; he quickly mounts the stairs to his plane as he waves a
heartrending goodbye to a young woman he’s left behind in the airport.
At the top step, he bumps into another young woman: it’s</p>
<p><strong>124 int. apartment - day 124</strong>: Michael is in bed.
It’s noon, the sun’s shining brightly, and a BLONDE is asleep beside
him. Michael is on the phone.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Peter? Yeah? What? Yow-ee! Hooray!
Terrific! That’s fantastic! I’ll call Jack – We’re gonna celebrate
tonight!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: They won! They won!</p>
<p><strong>blonde</strong>: Who won?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Peter. He won the competition!</p>
<p><strong>blonde</strong>: Great! Who’s Peter?</p>
<p><strong>125 int. apartment - evening 125</strong>: Peter enters the
apartment with Natalie. A bunch of crepe paper streamers are hanging in
the hall, as well as posters with various things written on them:</p>
<p><strong>hurray!</strong>: Jack comes running in with a bottle of
champagne, he POPS the CORK. Jack hugs Peter tightly as Michael comes in
with glasses and tries to catch the champagne that’s flowing all over.
They all shout and go bananas celebrating.</p>
<p><strong>126 int. apartment - night 126</strong>: Peter has his arm
around Natalie’s waist. She’s a little drunk. He kisses her and leads
her into his room, clos- ing the door behind him. Michael and Jack, who
were spying on them, tiptoe over to the door. They are silently exulting
over Peter’s second victory.</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: Here you are, my angel… Are you okay, honey?
Mommy’s finished now, you’ve been a very, very good girl. Thanks a lot
for looking after her.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Oh, she’s been great!</p>
<p><strong>128 int. hotel - night 128</strong>: Jack, in the corridor of
a large modern hotel somewhere</p>
<p><strong>130 int. apartment - night 130</strong>: Peter comes home
with Natalie. They take off their coats. They look tired.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Oh, my feet are killing me!</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: What the hell is this? Oh, it’s a giraffe…
… Oh, by the way, have you</p>
<p><strong>131 int. plane - day 131</strong>: Jack’s in his plane, at
the controls, waiting for takeoff. He’s daydreaming. His CO-PILOT comes
in and joins him.</p>
<p><strong>co-pilot</strong>: Hey, what’s the matter with you?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Whadda you mean, what’s the matter with
me?</p>
<p><strong>co-pilot</strong>: Are you sick?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Me? No. I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>co-pilot</strong>: C’mon, Jack! Didn’t you see who we’ve got
on board today?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Sure I did, why?</p>
<p><strong>co-pilot</strong>: Well… look…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: So it’s the Rockettes, so what?</p>
<p><strong>co-pilot</strong>: And you’re just sitting there like
that?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Whaddaya mean, sitting there? I happen to be
getting ready to fly this airplane.</p>
<p><strong>co-pilot</strong>: Okay, forget it.</p>
<p><strong>graton</strong>: Hi…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hi?</p>
<p><strong>graton</strong>: Don’t you recognize me?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Wait… uh, no…</p>
<p><strong>graton</strong>: I’m the one who was tailing you… Remember,
in the park…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Oh, yeah, the park… the diaper and all…</p>
<p><strong>graton</strong>: That’s it, the diaper… But don’t worry. This
isn’t an investigation, I left the force four months ago, and anyway,
they’ve arrested the whole gang since then… I just wanted to ask you
something…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Have you noticed? I’m pregnant.</p>
<p><strong>graton</strong>: Oh yeah, I see…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: So, shall we go for a walk?</p>
<p><strong>133 ext. riverside - day 133</strong>: Graton and Jack are
sitting on a bench beside the East River. Jack, still pregnant, has
brought along his bottle of scotch, and he takes a swig from it
occasion- ally. Graton has brought along his rabbit.</p>
<p><strong>graton</strong>: There’s something I have to know…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Wouldn’t you like to be pregnant?</p>
<p><strong>graton</strong>: What? Oh sure… maybe… no… I dunno… Look,
there’s been something bothering me for a long time.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You see, if I was God, and I could create the
world all over again, here’s what I would do: I would create Adam from
Eve’s rib, not the other way around.</p>
<p><strong>graton</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>graton</strong>: That’s an interesting idea… Actually, I just
wanted to ask you…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: At least that way things would have been
clearer to begin with, y’see. They wouldn’t have made us believe that
somebody could come out of our rib, y’know? ’Cause nothing ever comes
out of our rib, y’know? Ever. Only out of our prick, and even then …
Everything still has to be done after that.</p>
<p><strong>graton</strong>: That’s for sure…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What we men know how to make is planes,
buildings, cars, and all that stuff… It’s useful, mind</p>
<p><strong>graton</strong>: It’s driving me crazy! This thing keeps
going around and around in my head…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: And you know what, it’s not even like they
wanted us to believe it – it might have been us who wanted to believe
it… But let’s face it, nobody comes out of our rib…</p>
<p><strong>graton</strong>: Was the dope in the diaper, yes or no?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Still, that’s hard to take, goddam it!</p>
<p><strong>graton</strong>: Was it in the diaper, or not?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: The dope? It was in the diaper, why?</p>
<p><strong>graton</strong>: Oh, thanks a lot. I feel so much better now.
Here, this is a rabbit for your baby. Thanks again, ’bye, I’m so
happy.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: toward him</p>
<p><strong>134 int. kitchen - morning 134</strong>: Jack and Michael,
slumped in their chairs, are having breakfast. It’s a gray day. It’s
POURING out. Peter, bending over a bowl of steaming water, with a towel
over his head, is inhaling the steam. When he looks up to speak, we see
his swollen tear-streaked</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Tomorrow, San Francisco!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Say hello to the Pacific for me.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’ll be back the day after tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You’ll be id a foul bood – jet lag really
wipes out you dow.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Whaddya mean, now?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah: you didd’t used to give a shit before,
but dow it docks you out.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Before what?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: back over the</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It doesn’t knock me out at all…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Is there any jam left?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Do.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You eatig here todight?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Y’mean the Japanese one?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No, she’s from Finland. Oh damn it. What the
hell’s her name? They’ve got such weird names… Magdalena… no, Marianna…
no … oh, I can’t remember – anyway it’s Ma-something or other…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Mary?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: This fuckig cold! I look like I’b cryig all
the tibe but I’b dot – it’s just this dab cold.</p>
<p><strong>135 int. sylvia’s studio apartment - night 135</strong>:
Jack, holding a bouquet of flowers and Graton’s rabbit, rings the
doorbell of an apartment. On the door a card reads “SYLVIA AND MARY.” A
chubby YOUNG MAN with thick glasses opens the door.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hi. Is Sylvia in?</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: No, she’ll be back in a couple of hours –
around midnight, she said…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Wanna come in and wait for her?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Sure… Why not?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Sylvia doing okay?</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: I don’t know – I’m a med student. I’m
just babysitting. I only met her a couple hours ago.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Oh, I see…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Listen, on second thought, I don’t think I’ll
wait for her. Just give her this when she gets back, okay? And this is
for the baby.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Sure, no problem.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Shouldn’t the baby be in bed by now?</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Yeah… I don’t know… When I put her to bed
she cries so I just let her stay up…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Don’t you have any tights to put on her
legs?</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Tights?… Well, it’s pretty hot in here
anyway…</p>
<p><strong>136 int. living room - day 136</strong>: Jack, in his pilot’s
uniform, is sitting on the living room couch. Michael is standing before
him.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: You want me to call them?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: But you’ve got to let them know!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No, I’m not going anywhere anymore, I’ve had
it with traveling. I quit.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: C’mon, I’ll call you a cab, you’ve still
got time.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Don’t you call anybody.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: But the plane’s s’posed to take off in half
an hour – They won’t have time to replace you. This is serious – you’ll
lose your job and you won’t be able to pay your share of the apartment
anymore… you…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’ll be a dishwasher, I’ll live in a
flophouse.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: What the hell happened?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m not going, I told you; I’m not going ever
again. I’m sick and tired of traveling, sick and tired of broads. They
all have the same asses and I can’t seem to love them anyway. I can’t
take another hotel room, and swimming pools and trendy restaurants! I
want to know</p>
<p><strong>137 int. apartment - evening 137</strong>: Michael, wearing
an apron and holding a wooden spoon, goes into Jack’s room. The latter,
lying on his bed, is smoking and staring at the ceiling.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Come on, I made us a good dinner. I bought
some filet mignon and Haagen-Dazs butter pecan. When Peter comes back
he’ll cheer you up…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: He’s been here all day.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: He has? I didn’t hear him…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: He’s in his room.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Peter! Dinner’s ready!</p>
<p><strong>138 int. apartment - morning 138</strong>: The DOORBELL
RINGS. A bare-chested Michael, in jeans, drags himself over to the front
door and opens it. There stands Sylvia with Mary in her stroller.</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: Is Jack here? ’Cause I’m a mess. I can’t
handle it, I’m all alone…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Jack! Jack, c’mere for Chrissake!</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: ’Cause my place is tiny, y’know, and my
schedule’s insane – and I just finished four days of posing and we ended
up every day at…</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: Yeah, y’see, Jack, I just did four days of
posing…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: And every day we finished at three in the
morning and since Mary always gets up around 5:30…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: Well, you can imagine how much sleep I’ve
gotten…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah, of course, ’cause after the 5:30 bottle
it starts all over again around nine…</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: And by the time I change her and play with
her a little, it’s already eight o’clock…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: And then that’s it – you get only an hour of
sleep.</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: And the babysitters till three A.M. – all my
money is sucked</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Plus they don’t put the kids to bed, they let
them lie around half-naked…</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: Oh, so the flowers and the rabbit were from
you…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I could have strangled that guy…</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: I mean it, I can’t cope anymore. My parents
and I don’t talk to each other and anyway they live in Texas, and the
baby needs to get out to the park…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Yeah, tell me about it! Finding time to
take her to the park every day is a real bitch!</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: And I have to work, I need the money to
survive and anyway I love my job…</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: But to work I’ve gotta have a babysitter,
and to have a babysitter I need to work, so I run around all day… … and
I’m not sure I’m taking good care of her…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Of course you’re taking good care of her – we
know what it’s like, don’t cry, she looks great…</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: It’s just ’cause I haven’t slept in four
nights – she must be teething or something, I don’t know but I can’t
manage…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Don’t worry, it’s nothing, she’s</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: She pulled the same thing on us. We lost
all our friends in one night – on account of one tooth!</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: And just look at my face! Nobody’s going to
want me to model for them with the way my face looks… And what’ll happen
to me if they don’t want me anymore?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: But you’re beautiful – At your age all you
need is a good night’s sleep and you’ll look like new.</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: Right, a good night’s sleep – but when?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Well, why don’t you leave the baby with us
for a few days, till you recuperate… I mean, if you want.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: We’re old pros – it’s not a big deal for
us…</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: Really? I can leave her with you for a
little while?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Of course. Leave her with us. Come back
whenever you want. Get some rest.</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: I brought a couple of things for her, just
for a few days…</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: Yeah, it’s time for her bottle – it’s all
ready in the bag…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’ll go heat up some water right away. Would
you like a cup of coffee?</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: Oh, okay, thanks…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I’ll go make up her bed!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Hey, you guys – come and see, come and
see!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Come see, I said.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: The poor thing, she’s really wiped out.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: She’ll need two or three months to recover, at
least… Maybe more!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: We could set up a room for her here…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: A room for her and a room for Mary…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Then we could have four shifts instead of
three!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah, but I don’t think she’ll agree. She’s
got her own life to live.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Yeah, she probably wouldn’t want to move
here. She’d think we’d jump on her any chance we could…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: But we’d make a rule, she’d just be ‘one of
the guys!’</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: She’ll never want to…</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: So, I’ll take the ten A.M. to three P.M.
shift… And I’ll take every other night… plus the walk in the park in the
afternoon before I go to work… and we split the rent equally… and I’ll
just be ‘one of the guys’… deal?</p>
<p><strong>peter, michael, and jack</strong>: Deal.</p>
