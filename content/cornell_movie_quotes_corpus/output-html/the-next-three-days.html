<p><strong>shooting script</strong>: August 6, 2009</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: You know what? If you were smart you would
stop talking right now.</p>
<p><strong>erit</strong>: Sue me. I just know that women should never
work for women.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: How can you say that??</p>
<p><strong>erit</strong>: They’re always threatened. Especially if
you’re beautiful and they’re not.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: Erit, you are so full of shit.</p>
<p><strong>erit</strong>: So, your boss isn’t threatened by you?</p>
<p>****: 2.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: Because she’s a bitch! – –Not because she’s a
woman.</p>
<p><strong>erit</strong>: And you would describe her as
“attractive”?</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: That has nothing to do with it!</p>
<p><strong>erit</strong>: And there is my answer.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Either of you like another drink?</p>
<p><strong>erit</strong>: Women should work under men, men under women.
That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: But men under men?</p>
<p><strong>erit</strong>: That’s fine, too. They’re used to it! Why are
you laughing?</p>
<p><strong>mick</strong>: I don’t know, bro, but I think I’d rather work
under you than her.</p>
<p><strong>erit</strong>: Oh please, I’d rather work under him, too.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: You’d rather “work under” John?</p>
<p><strong>erit</strong>: You have a problem with that, too?</p>
<p>****: 3.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: No, why would I have a problem with your
little sexual innuendo?</p>
<p><strong>erit</strong>: What is up your ass tonight??</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: So, I shouldn’t take offense that you’re
coming on to my husband right in front of me.</p>
<p><strong>erit</strong>: Lara, if I wanted your husband I would have
him.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: How? You couldn’t possibly show him more of
your tits.</p>
<p><strong>erit</strong>: – You know what your problem is?!</p>
<p><strong>john mick</strong>: That was a great meal! Okay–okay!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: She is completely full of shit.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: DON’T try and agree with me now.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You know what? I don’t even believe she is in
the dental profession.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p>****: 4.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I bet she can’t even spell anesthesiologist.
Woman’s a complete fraud.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: We went to her office party, idiot.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I think she hit on me that night, too.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: You are completely delusional. She wasn’t even
hitting on you in there; I just don’t like her.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I understand. People who look like that should
not be allowed anywhere near oral surgery.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: You are such an asshole.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You’re in the chair trying to stay calm; how
are you supposed to do that with those things hanging over your–</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Someone’s going to –</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: Hello!</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: Did he cry?</p>
<p><strong>jenna</strong>: Only when I dropped him down the stairs.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Thanks. See you next weekend.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Okay, your turn.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Very good, very good…</p>
<p>****: 6.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No, no, no; you feed me. Your son is
hopeless.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: Squeeze in tight.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You can’t do this every morning. It is way too
corny.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: Smile. It’s just until he’s eighteen.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: Present.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Sweetie, you have to stop believing everything
you read in a catalogue.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: You hate brushing your teeth; this one brushes
them in thirty seconds.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I love brushing my teeth. The lies your mother
tells.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: When’s your last class?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Three, and I have papers to grade. Can you
pick up Luke?</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: After yesterday I probably don’t have a job
anyway. Do you think it was wrong to call her a useless cow?</p>
<p>****: 7.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Bosses admire that kind of frank exchange.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: Did you call your father?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: “When?” Yesterday, for his birthday!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I sent him flowers and a handmade card.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: You’re completely impossible.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Did you notice what I got for my birthday this
year? A grunt.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Mom said Happy Birthday and my father went .
Made me tear up.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: Ever think that someone has to be the bigger
person here?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Remember this for the custody hearing: how
Mommy is always scolding Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: How are you going to feel if Luke grows up and
doesn’t call you?</p>
<p>****: 8.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Now she’s driving a wedge between us.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: I give up.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: And now she is abandoning you.</p>
<p><strong>detective quinn</strong>: Police. Mr. Brennan?</p>
<p><strong>detective quinn</strong>: My name is Detective Quinn. This is
a search warrant for these premises.</p>
<p><strong>detective quinn</strong>: Stay where you are.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Get your –</p>
<p><strong>detective quinn</strong>: Touch me again and you’ll be
arrested.</p>
<p><strong>detective collero</strong>: Lara Brennan?</p>
<p><strong>detective collero</strong>: Lara Brennan, you are under
arrest for the murder of Elizabeth Gesas.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: She’s dead?? Elizabeth is dead??</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: She didn’t do anything!</p>
<p><strong>detective quinn</strong>: I will only –</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: She didn’t do anything!</p>
<p><strong>detective quinn</strong>: Put him in cuffs.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Daddy!… DADDY!!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It’s okay. Just a bad dream.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Okay, you can sleep here as long as you stay
on this side of the bed.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You’re such a snake, I don’t know why I keep
falling for the same trick.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: But Sam’s your friend, right?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Not at lunch.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Does he take your food?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Did he say something mean? About Mommy?</p>
<p>****: 11.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Did you hit him?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Good. Where did you hit him?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Near the swings.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Wow. I bet that hurt.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It’s a toy!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Don’t worry. We’ll get it back.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: Hi honey. Can Mommy get a kiss? Come on, give
Mommy a kiss.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Rat-Bag. Give Mommy a kiss.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: Is Daddy reading you my letters?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Every night at bedtime.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: What are you building? A fort?</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: Was he scared going to school?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I walked him to class, gave him a kiss; he
didn’t even look back to wave.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: What did you make him for lunch?</p>
<p>****: 13.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Turkey sandwich, just butter and bread, no
“vegetables” on it. He swore he ate his apple.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: Look at his friends. And his desk. This is his
teacher?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Miss Phillips.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: You may have to move to another school
district.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Already spoke to a realtor.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: How was your first day?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Excellent. Over half my class stayed awake.
Talked to your mom.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: When is she coming?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: She’s having a lot of trouble with her
business.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: It’s only been a couple of years, I’m sure
she’ll get around to it. Have you heard anything?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: About the appeal? Yes, and I’m just not
telling you. What did Meyer say?</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: –Don’t–</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: – It can take months for the court to
rule.</p>
<p>****: 14.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: I saw that woman. She was there. She couldn’t
have just disappeared.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Meyer’s looking for a new investigator.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: Her coat snagged my purse, I felt a button pop
- they must have been blind not to find it.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: He’ll go through all the evidence again.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: Great, because I haven’t quite bankrupted us
yet.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: We’re doing fine.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: You just lie and lie. But you are very
handsome. Can you do me a favor?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I don’t know, I’m a little busy.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: I need you to run for governor.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: – Oh, that I can do.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: You can change this rule about no conjugal
visits, because I don’t think I can last another twenty years.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: I’m okay. I’m okay.</p>
<p>****: 15.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I know. But it’s going to be fine. I
promise.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: You think he’ll ever want to kiss me
again?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Good?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: How’s Lara?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: She’s doing okay.</p>
<p>****: 16.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Tell her we’re pulling for her.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I will.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: They won’t recycle these unless you take off
the cap. This is trash. This is recyclable.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Ok. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Luke! Let’s go, Toad. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Time to go, Carrie!</p>
<p><strong>meyer</strong>: John, I said my office at four o’clock. I
can’t leave, I’m in –</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I figured you had to eat.</p>
<p>****: 17.</p>
<p><strong>meyer</strong>: Do you have the ruling in Brennan?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: But what if we find the woman who was leaving
the parking lot?</p>
<p><strong>meyer</strong>: The PCRA was rejected. No new evidence can be
submitted. Not anymore.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It was a robbery! Someone stole her purse!</p>
<p><strong>meyer</strong>: And if they’d used her credit cards we would
have had something to argue. I’m sorry; this really…sucks.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: So, that’s it. Now we just have the Supreme
Court.</p>
<p><strong>meyer</strong>: John, in the last thirty years, the Supreme
Court hasn’t heard one murder case. No decent lawyer would even file the
pleadings.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: So, I need to find an indecent one?</p>
<p><strong>meyer</strong>: No, I’m going to file it. But I need you to
do something for me.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Anything.</p>
<p>****: 18.</p>
<p><strong>meyer</strong>: I need you to look at the evidence and just
forget Lara is your wife.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’ve seen the evidence, Meyer.</p>
<p><strong>meyer</strong>: I’m not saying judge her innocent or guilty,
I’m just saying look at it. He co-worker sees her leaving the scene, she
has the victim’s blood on her clothes, her fingerprints on the murder
weapon–</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: We went out for dinner! How do you do that
after you kill somebody? She would have to be a psychopath!</p>
<p><strong>meyer</strong>: – And the fight in the office.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Everyone fights with their boss!</p>
<p><strong>meyer</strong>: But this one ended up dead.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: So, you never believed she was innocent?</p>
<p><strong>meyer</strong>: How can you say that?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: So, what are you saying, Meyer?!</p>
<p><strong>meyer</strong>: That it no longer matters what we believe;
Lara’s not getting out. And you have no idea how much I hate saying
that.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’ll find someone to file the pleadings.</p>
<p>****: 19.</p>
<p><strong>meyer</strong>: John! Come on! For Christ’s sake.</p>
<p><strong>erit</strong>: I know you won’t want to hear this…</p>
<p>****: 20.</p>
<p><strong>mick</strong>: – Erit, go put somebody to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>mick</strong>: Had to be done. I am really going to pay for
that.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Lara Brennan; my wife. She was sent up here.
Brennan. B-R-</p>
<p><strong>duty nurse</strong>: She can’t have visitors.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That’s ridiculous; I have to see her.</p>
<p><strong>duty nurse</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>duty nurse</strong>: You can’t go down there!</p>
<p><strong>duty nurse</strong>: You can’t be in here!!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Lara!</p>
<p>****: 22.</p>
<p><strong>hospital security guard #1</strong>: I got him!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Lara!</p>
<p><strong>dr. becsey</strong>: What’s going on?!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: My wife attempted suicide.</p>
<p><strong>hospital guard 1 duty nurse</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I have to see her!</p>
<p><strong>dr. becsey</strong>: Why isn’t she in the ER?</p>
<p><strong>hospital guard 1 duty nurse</strong>: I’m not asking. Now.
She’s a transfer from County</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Please. Two minutes.</p>
<p><strong>dr. becsey</strong>: Two minutes.</p>
<p><strong>jenna</strong>: I’m sorry. He just keeps pretending he’s
asleep.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Don’t worry about it.</p>
<p><strong>jenna</strong>: It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I insist. I kept you out on a school
night.</p>
<p><strong>jenna</strong>: I’m not in school anymore.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: And give a big hug to Pengui, Little Pengui,
Big Turtley, Little Turtley, Kiki and Opossumy. Lots and lots of love,
Mommy. You gonna give them hugs from her? Should we write her back?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: …When is she coming home?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Soon honey. Soon.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Can I have a quarter?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Can you have a quarter?</p>
<p>****: 24.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Ohhh. Sure, but you can’t spend those. They
come from the cottage where Mommy and I used to take you when you were a
baby.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Then can I have them all?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: …Sure.</p>
<p>****: 25.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: So, what is it about? Julie?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: That belief in someone’s virtue is more
important than virtue itself?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No. I mean, yes, that’s in there. But what is
it about?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It is about how rational thought destroys the
soul. It is about the triumph of irrationality, and the power that is in
it.</p>
<p><strong>on the screen</strong>: a book summary disappears, to be
replaced by the school search engine – many of the items have already
been inspected. John finds one that reads “Over The Walls.”</p>
<p>****: 26.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It’s a course that investigates what drives
men to be free, no matter the cost.</p>
<p><strong>damon</strong>: Somebody else had dibs on Papillon?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You escaped from jail seven times.</p>
<p><strong>tough guy</strong>: No smoking!!</p>
<p><strong>damon</strong>: Yeah, who would want to cut short your
precious life?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Mind if I tape you?</p>
<p><strong>damon</strong>: Go for it, it can’t be used as evidence. What
do you want to know?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: How you escaped when no one else could.</p>
<p><strong>damon</strong>: Balls and a little luck. No prison in the
world is airtight. Each one has a key. You have to find it.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: How do you do that?</p>
<p><strong>damon</strong>: A lot of looking. Especially at things that
break the daily routine. Guards get comfortable doing the same thing
every day. Something happens where they have to think, adapt.</p>
<p>****: 27.</p>
<p><strong>damon</strong>: That’s when they will make mistakes. But when
you see it you have to be ready. You have to have the entire plan
already in place before you even know how you are going to get out of
the jail. Escaping is easy; the hardest part is staying free.</p>
<p><strong>damon</strong>: You have to know where you are going to go
and how you are going to get there. You have to know how they plan to
catch you, where, and when.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: How the hell do you know that?</p>
<p><strong>damon</strong>: You pay off someone who knows. And a lot
depends on if the prison is in the country or the city.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: The city.</p>
<p><strong>damon</strong>: Where are you from?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: …Pittsburgh.</p>
<p><strong>damon</strong>: Pittsburgh is tough; so many bridges and
tunnels they can block off.</p>
<p>****: 28.</p>
<p><strong>damon</strong>: From the time they make the call, the police
can have the center of the city sealed tight in fifteen minutes.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: How can they be so exact?</p>
<p><strong>damon</strong>: After 9-11 Homeland Security made every city
have a lock-down plan – downtown Pittsburgh, Philly, Boston, Minneapolis
– fifteen minutes. They can do DC in under ten.</p>
<p><strong>damon</strong>: Within thirty-five minutes they will have
cops at every tollbooth on the interstate –</p>
<p><strong>damon</strong>: And be running rolling stops on the secondary
roads. They won’t have your photograph yet, but they will have your
description.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What if you can’t make it out?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Thirty-five minutes isn’t a lot of time.</p>
<p><strong>damon</strong>: Then surrender.</p>
<p>****: 29.</p>
<p><strong>damon</strong>: Because they will shoot you on sight, along
with anyone you are with.</p>
<p><strong>damon</strong>: Stay far away from the train and bus
stations.</p>
<p><strong>damon</strong>: Forget the local airports. Leave from another
state.</p>
<p><strong>damon</strong>: Second: identity. It’s easy to find fake
papers, harder to find ones that will get you through an airport.</p>
<p><strong>damon</strong>: You’ll need a passport, driver’s license and
a social security number.</p>
<p><strong>damon</strong>: If you have to rent a car, find a place that
will take a cash deposit. They’ll still run a credit check, so use a
real person’s name on the ID. Third: destination.</p>
<p>****: 30.</p>
<p><strong>damon</strong>: You want somewhere that doesn’t attract
American tourists and doesn’t get American newspapers. Think Yemen and
you get the idea.</p>
<p><strong>damon</strong>: Then money.</p>
<p><strong>damon</strong>: You need a truck load of it. Everything’s
expensive: hotels, travel, information.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>damon</strong>: Enough to last at least five-six years. Run
out of money and you run out of friends.</p>
<p><strong>damon</strong>: But before you do anything, you have to ask
yourself if you can do it. Can you forget about ever seeing your parents
again. Can you kill a guard, leave your kid at a gas station, push a
nice old lady to the ground because she is between you and the door?
Because to do this thing, that’s who you have to become. And if you
can’t, don’t start, because you’ll just get someone killed.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: How did you get caught?</p>
<p><strong>damon</strong>: I gave myself up. I couldn’t take wondering
when someone was going to come through the bedroom door. Got what you
need?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>damon</strong>: What do you have in your pocket?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: It was already tied.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: You untied it again!</p>
<p>****: 33.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Mr. Brennan?</p>
<p><strong>dr. lifson</strong>: We met briefly. Byrdie Lifson.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh, sorry. Hello, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>dr. lifson</strong>: I’ll bring them back myself.</p>
<p><strong>dr. lifson</strong>: We check your wife’s blood regularly.
She’s been refusing her insulin. I don’t want to sound dramatic, but
it’s just another form of suicide.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’ll talk to her.</p>
<p><strong>dr. lifson</strong>: If she doesn’t –</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’ll talk to her. Let’s go, Squirrel.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hey. Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: I’m fine. I’m fine.</p>
<p>****: 34.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: Hi, sweet potato. How are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: The doctor told me about the insulin.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: Yeah, I forgot. It’s no big deal.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You forgot? For how many days?</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: I forgot, okay? I have things on my mind.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: –And so much to do.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: Oh, that’s nice.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Why are you doing this?</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: Can I please just watch him play? Tell me
about kindergarten.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No. I need you to –</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: Fine, I won’t forget again, okay? I am just
never going to walk him to school or wash his clothes or make him
dinner…and I don’t know how I can live knowing that. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Lara. Look at me. Something will happen. I
promise.</p>
<p>****: 35.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: What? What is going to happen? There are no
more appeals, there are no more anything. Exactly what miracle are we
hoping for, John?</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: I need you to do something for me.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: Stop bringing him.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Come on…</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: He hates coming here. Look at him.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Lara….</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: Please. It’s not his fault. It’s too hard to
watch him forget me.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: You want to hear something funny?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yes. Anything.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: My mother tried to send me anti-aging
cream.</p>
<p><strong>eugenie</strong>: You’re sure that you don’t want a lawn
sign?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m very sure. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>copter pilot</strong>: On the left, Allegheny County Jail.
Built in 1995, it is now the largest jail in the world. There have been
three escape attempts. No one’s made it out alive. On your right…</p>
<p><strong>lyla</strong>: On the first landing, which was as small as
the necessary turn of the stairs allowed, there was a niche in the
column, about a yard wide, and in this niche the prince felt convinced
that a man stood concealed. He thought he could distinguish a figure
standing there.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Adderall?</p>
<p><strong>mouss</strong>: Ten apiece, five for forty.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I need some passports.</p>
<p><strong>mouss</strong>: Piss off.</p>
<p><strong>mouss</strong>: You have to pay up front.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I can do that.</p>
<p><strong>mouss</strong>: You know the Uptown on 5th Ave?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mouss</strong>: Ask for Harv.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>mouss</strong>: Just say Mouss.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Mouss said to come see you.</p>
<p><strong>harv</strong>: He did, did he? What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Three passports, a driver’s license, and real
social security number.</p>
<p><strong>harv</strong>: How do you know Mouss?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: He babysits my kid.</p>
<p><strong>harv</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>harv</strong>: You have the photos on you?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yes. How much?</p>
<p><strong>harv</strong>: Fifteen hundred.</p>
<p><strong>mouss</strong>: I ever see you again, you lose an eye.</p>
<p><strong>eugenie</strong>: You did remember I was showing the
house?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Give me two minutes.</p>
<p><strong>eugenie</strong>: It really is a great neighborhood.</p>
<p>****: 41.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Oh, my lord! What happened?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It was stupid, I fell off the bike.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: The bike that’s been in our garage for two
years? Put your head back.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Some guy made a crack about Lara.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: So, that’s what you do now: punch everyone
who thinks she’s guilty?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What’s that supposed to mean?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: It means it’s important what YOU believe, not
–</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Really? So, what do you believe, Mom?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Why are you trying to start a fight?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Come on, buddy! Where is his bag?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Why are you doing this?!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No reason. I just stupidly thought people who
loved her would actually believe she’s innocent. My mistake.</p>
<p>****: 42.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Stop this!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Give Grandma a kiss.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Does your face hurt?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: A little.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Did you hit him back?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: That’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I was at the bar. I know what you are looking
for.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I’m deaf, you idiot. I read lips.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: You really want to talk out here?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: What do you need?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Three passports, a driver’s license and social
security number that can take a credit check.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Thirty seven hundred.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That’s too much.</p>
<p>****: 44.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: It is if you never get them. I need photos and
a thousand in advance.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I’ll bring them Wednesday.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Not here. Don’t come here again.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Parking lot of Don’s. Eckert Street. Under the
bridge; two o’clock. If I’m not there on time, leave.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Show me how to load it.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No video game.</p>
<p>****: 45.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Dad!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’ll play checkers with you after dinner.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: You’ll just lose again.</p>
<p><strong>eugenie</strong>: John? It’s Eugenie. You’re not going to
believe it; the people I brought over? They made an offer! I’ll bring it
in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Not tonight. Tonight, I utterly destroy
you.</p>
<p><strong>kid on screen</strong>: – a bump key. First, find any key
that fits into the same make of lock.</p>
<p><strong>notary</strong>: Mr. Brennan?</p>
<p><strong>notary</strong>: And just put your thumb there.</p>
<p><strong>notary</strong>: Thanks, that’s all I need.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’ll just be a moment.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: Your poor face. How could you do that to
yourself?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I am useless without you. I can’t even ride a
bike.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: I think it’s very sexy.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m sorry we had to do this.</p>
<p>****: 47.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: You have nothing to apologize for. But you
should have told me before this.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: I don’t want you not telling me things.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: From now on I will.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: I won’t know where to picture you. I close my
eyes and I see Luke in his bedroom, you on the sofa by the Window. I
won’t know where to picture you anymore.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: John?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p>****: 48.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: I was wondering if I could ask you to water
my plants next week; I’m going in for an operation.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I hope it’s nothing serious.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: My idiot doctor misdiagnosed me. He’s blaming
the lab; the lab’s blaming him. But I’ll be fine. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: English Department, this is
Catherine.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hi. It’s John. Luke isn’t feeling well, I’m
going to take him home. I need Carl to cover my 2:30 class.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: I will let him know.</p>
<p>****: 49.</p>
<p><strong>mick</strong>: Are you ever going to answer your goddamn
phone?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: You were supposed to leave.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I need them.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: You notice that guy was a cop?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Which guy?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: The one with the red light in his back
window.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Just give me the money.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: You want this too much. You’re going to fuck
it up.</p>
<p>****: 50.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: How are you doing today?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Don’t touch that.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: So, you are where in here?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: …In the middle there.</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: In the middle. Can you point to yourself?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It’s hard to tell. I think that’s me there.
Why?</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: So that’s not you there. By the elevator?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: ….No. I was over here. You want to tell me
what’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: You want me to tell you?</p>
<p>****: 52.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: You know what a bump key is?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: If this was you, you might want to think
about what’s going to happen to your kids if both of their parents are
in prison.</p>
<p><strong>detective collero</strong>: – The worst date you’ve ever been
on? This was worse. And this guy? He really thinks he is doing great.
Then he’s driving me home and I know he’s going to try and kiss me, so I
pretend to fall asleep. I mean, I’m actually snoring, right in his car.
Does that stop him?</p>
<p><strong>detective collero</strong>: …What?</p>
<p>****: 53.</p>
<p><strong>detective quinn</strong>: Did I tell you not to date
cops?</p>
<p><strong>mick</strong>: Let me in, asshole!!</p>
<p><strong>mick</strong>: Open up! Your car is in the garage, I know
you’re in there!</p>
<p><strong>male neighbor</strong>: What’s your problem? He’s not
home!</p>
<p><strong>mick</strong>: Not home? So you’re saying I’m blind?</p>
<p><strong>male neighbor</strong>: No, I’m saying you’re an idiot.</p>
<p>****: 54.</p>
<p><strong>mick</strong>: You know what? You’re right. I am an
idiot.</p>
<p><strong>and and</strong>: 157 157</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: …Dad?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Can I have my cookies?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You hungry? You want your sandwich?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Carrie! I’m sorry. She just already has it
all figured out. Nicole.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I remember.</p>
<p>****: 55.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I remember your daughter.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: She’s hard to forget. Oh, this is for you.
Luke was supposed to bring it home.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: He has his father’s memory.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: It’s for Carrie’s birthday party. Please
come; I’d love to meet your wife.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m afraid she can’t be there. …It’s
complicated.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: I understand. With me, too. Carrie, come on,
time for lunch. We’re going to the cafe on the corner, would you like to
join us?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh, we’re pretty…you know….</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Busy?</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Come on, we owe you for the cookies.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That’s true. And I made those cookies.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: And learned how to pre-package them.</p>
<p>****: 56.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Which requires a considerable amount of
machinery. Come on, Luke.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Do you trade off time with Luke?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No. Luke and I are together full time.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Wow. I guess that’s why I see you so
much.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: She’d like nothing better than to be here.
With him. Lara. She really misses…all this.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: I guess it’s all about priorities, isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No. She’s not like that. She’d… She’s in
prison.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I don’t tell most people.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: She’s innocent. She didn’t kill the woman.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: …Good. I mean, I’m sure she didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: We should really be getting home.</p>
<p>****: 57.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Oh, okay.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Thanks for the invitation. We’ll try and make
it.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: That would be great.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You want to read a letter from Mom?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Dearest Luke Who I Love, But Not As Much As
Chocolate…</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: She didn’t write that.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: My mistake. Dearest Luke, who I love so, so
much. I wish I could have walked you home today, it was so beautiful
out.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: But what’s wrong with her?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: She’s not feeling well.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Why didn’t she just stay home?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Because sometimes people get so sick you have
to go to the hospital to get fixed.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: How do you know when you’re that sick?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: The doctors do tests.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Luke! Time for bed.</p>
<p>****: 61.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: …What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No….NO! They can’t move you. Not without
notice! Monday isn’t notice!</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: I was only here through the appeal. We knew
I’d be moved to a prison.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Muncy is the other side of the state.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I don’t have two weeks! I need it
tomorrow!</p>
<p><strong>eugenie</strong>: The title hasn’t been cleared – there is no
way that –</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: How much can they give me?!</p>
<p><strong>eugenie</strong>: Nothing!</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: What are you doing?! You almost killed
us!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Are you –?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Are you out of your mind?! You don’t
look?!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I am so sorry –</p>
<p>****: 63.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Get away! Get away from us!</p>
<p><strong>meyer</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No, it was a long shot. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>meyer</strong>: How’s Lara?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: She’s okay. Thanks, Meyer.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: Is it Luke?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No. He’s fine. I had Meyer see what he could
do about not getting you moved.</p>
<p>****: 64.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I told him traveling that distance would be a
hardship on us, that Luke was already having trouble at school. Which is
true. I haven’t been spending enough time with him.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: You haven’t? YOU haven’t? God, John, you are
too much. Luke is having a ‘hard time’ because mommy is in jail for
murder, not because daddy doesn’t spend enough time with him! Your
father was right, you don’t live in the same world we do.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That’s nice, that the two of you talk. What
world do I live in, Lara?</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: I don’t know, but it’s not the real one. I am
in here for the rest of my life! And you want me to believe in some
fantasy that – !</p>
<p><strong>female guard</strong>: We good here?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yes. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: Now you come here all long-faced, like you’ve
let me down. What do you want me to do, make you feel better?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Got it. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: And now you’re apologizing. You really are a
gem.</p>
<p>****: 65.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What do you want from me?</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: Nothing. You’re too perfect already. You know
you never even asked me if I did it. If I killed her.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Because I knew you didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: Then you’d be wrong.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: I grabbed the fire extinguisher. I hit her in
the face. I heard her neck snap. You know why I did it? Because she
pissed me off. I threw her purse in the river. We paid for dinner with
the cash from her wallet.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: I’m sorry. I’m actually very sorry.</p>
<p><strong>guard #2</strong>: Sir, you cannot stand there. SIR, you need
to exit the building</p>
<p><strong>now.</strong>: 66.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Shut up. I don’t care what you say or how you
say it. I don’t believe you did it and I never will. I know who you
are.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You think?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Girls love them.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hi Mom.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’ve got class.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Five o’clock at night?</p>
<p>****: 67.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yes. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Back up! Get back!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: – Shoot them both!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: – I’ll shoot the dog!</p>
<p>****: 69.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: – Shoot the dog!</p>
<p><strong>thug</strong>: – You shoot the dog, I’ll kill you!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: – You want the police here, asshole?!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: – Good idea!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: – Put the gun down!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: – Call the dog off!! Put it away!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: – Release!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: – Put it away!!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: In! Get in!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You, too!</p>
<p><strong>thug</strong>: I’m not getting in there!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Get in!</p>
<p>****: 70.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: – Give me that chair!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Move!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: You’re dead.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I didn’t do anything!!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: You brought him!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I didn’t bring him!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: On your knees! Hands behind your head!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I can’t kneel!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: On the floor!</p>
<p>****: 71.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Where’s the rest?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: That’s twelve hundred dollars! Here, take
it.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Where do you keep your money?!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Yeah, I’m going to give you my money.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’ll shoot you!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: You won’t even shoot a dog.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Tell me!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Shoot the floor again, impress me.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m going to kill you both.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: No, I’m going to kill you both.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Give him your money!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Keep your dead bitch mouth shut.</p>
<p>****: 72.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Stop it!!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: See? You aren’t going to kill me. That was the
worst you can do. So, now you’ve done it. Go home. I’ll come find you
and kill you.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: You’re wasting some good shit.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah, good shit; high alcohol content.</p>
<p><strong>thug</strong>: What’s going on?! Let me out!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: You going to burn me out?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah. That’s what I’m going to do.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Your money.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: This is a meth lab, you idiot!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No. It was.</p>
<p>****: 73.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: My kid is upstairs!!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: – What??</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Let me go!!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Get up there!!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: The house is going to explode!</p>
<p>****: 74.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Is anyone up here?!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Don’t leave me. I don’t want to burn. Don’t
let me burn.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I don’t want to die. I don’t want to die.</p>
<p><strong>lt. nabulsi</strong>: Get out of my way.</p>
<p><strong>lt. nabulsi</strong>: What do we have?</p>
<p><strong>sgt. harris</strong>: A miracle. Meth lab in the basement,
the house still standing. Should be just a crater.</p>
<p><strong>lt. nabulsi</strong>: Do we know him?</p>
<p><strong>sgt. harris</strong>: Alex Gaidar, history of violence and
drug trafficking.</p>
<p><strong>lt. nabulsi</strong>: He have a kid?</p>
<p><strong>sgt. harris</strong>: Neighbor said wife left with him last
year. Big surprise there.</p>
<p><strong>lt. nabulsi</strong>: They type all this blood yet?</p>
<p><strong>sgt. harris</strong>: No, but someone left through the back
door bleeding. Zone Three found a gunshot victim dead on a transit
bench.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hi. What are you doing up?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’ve come to get Luke.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: John? Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hey. Hey, buddy.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What do you say?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Give Grandma a big kiss.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I’m too tired to kiss.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Luke…</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I’ll get lots of kisses next weekend. We want

should have looked more carefully.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: It’s no problem. Why don’t you go give this
to Carrie?</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Well, I guess you can help.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh. Actually, I can’t stay. I have to run some
errands.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: We’ll see you later then.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Thanks so much. If….</p>

pocket. In case I’m late.</p>

<p><strong>sgt. harris</strong>: Husband. School teacher.</p>
<p><strong>lt. nabulsi</strong>: You got a home address?</p>

coming.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: How can you do this to me?</p>
<p>****: 90.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Push send. Tell him I’m not coming back
either.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: John –</p>

<p>****: 106.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Stay in the car.</p>
<p><strong>lt. nabulsi</strong>: I understand….I understand. I didn’t
tell them to stop EVERY vehicle. Just the ones with a couple and a young
child.</p>
<p><strong>elderly man</strong>: Are you sure twenty dollars is enough?
Ticket to Buffalo costs three times that.</p>
<p>****: 107.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: This thing is very good on gas.</p>
<p><strong>detective collero</strong>: Every one in the state.</p>

<p><strong>detective collero</strong>: So, Ohio, Maryland, West
Virginia, New York, New Jersey, Virginia, Michigan, Kentucky and
Indiana?</p>
<p><strong>lt. nabulsi</strong>: You know what direction they are going,
smart ass?</p>
<p><strong>detective collero</strong>: Captain, a lot of these places
barely have fax machines.</p>
<p><strong>lt. nabulsi</strong>: Then start dialing. Prioritize. Closest
airports first.</p>
<p>****: 108.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. harris</strong>: You want to see it?</p>
<p><strong>lt. nabulsi</strong>: Only if it will tell me where they

<p><strong>lt. nabulsi</strong>: How far is it to the Canadian
border?</p>
<p><strong>sgt. harris</strong>: Four, five hours?</p>
<p><strong>lt. nabulsi</strong>: Collero!!</p>
<p><strong>erit</strong>: Excuse me? You call this coffee?</p>
<p><strong>sgt. harris</strong>: I’m calling from the Pittsburgh Police
Department. We have a fugitive warrant for Lara and John Brennan, they

reason to believe they might be flying out of your airport.</p>
<p>****: 109.</p>
<p><strong>lt. nabulsi</strong>: How many airports in Ontario and

<p>****: 110.</p>
<p><strong>detective collero</strong>: So, you just decided to go for a
drive, for the entire day?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: George wanted to see the leaves.</p>
<p><strong>lt. nabulsi</strong>: So you have absolutely no idea where
they are going?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I told you. We never spoke.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: I’ll do this.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p>****: 111.</p>
<p><strong>detective quinn</strong>: Too bad you didn’t find more of
it.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. harris</strong>: Yeah. And wish I could figure out where
this is.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. harris</strong>: I checked websites for every tourist
destination I could –</p>
<p><strong>detective collero</strong>: That’s the presidential palace.
It was all over CNN. When they deposed…what’s-his-name.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. harris</strong>: We know where they’re going!</p>
<p><strong>air canada attendant</strong>: We’ll now begin boarding by
rows.</p>
<p><strong>airport security chief</strong>: Sorry. There is no one by
their description on the flight.</p>
<p><strong>lt. nabulsi</strong>: They’re on it. Do you have the
photographs?</p>
<p><strong>air canada attendant</strong>: Can I take this for you?</p>
<p><strong>airport security chief</strong>: We have the photographs.
They aren’t on this plane.</p>

<p><strong>airport security chief</strong>: Are there any other flights
to Haiti tonight?</p>
<p><strong>airport security chief</strong>: No other flights. Anything
else?</p>
<p><strong>lt. nabulsi</strong>: ….No. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>detective quinn</strong>: It’s starting to rain.</p>
<p><strong>detective collero</strong>: I’ll call the FBI.</p>
<p><strong>detective quinn</strong>: You ask yourself why we found this
bag and not the others?</p>
<p><strong>air canada attendant</strong>: The captain has switched off
the seat belt light. Flight time to Caracas, Venezuela this evening is
five hours and fifteen minutes. While in your seat, the captain
asks–</p>
<p><strong>lt. nabulsi</strong>: This guy was a teacher?</p>
<p><strong>sgt. harris</strong>: At a community college.</p>
<p>****: 115.</p>
<p><strong>detective quinn</strong>: Was it raining when we searched the
crime scene?</p>
<p><strong>detective collero</strong>: Three years ago?? What are we
doing here?</p>
<p><strong>detective quinn</strong>: Act like a cop. Grab the other
side.</p>
<p><strong>detective collero</strong>: You’re out of your mind.</p>
<p><strong>detective collero</strong>: You really thought you were going
to find it?</p>
