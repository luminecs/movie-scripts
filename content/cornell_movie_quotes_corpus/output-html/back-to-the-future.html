<h1 id="back-to-the-future">back-to-the-future</h1>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Professor Brown! It’s almost eight thirty –
I’m outta here!</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Shhhhhhhh!</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Blast it! Twenty four measly
volts!</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: The power of a million
hydrogen bombs! …and we get twenty four measly volts. It’s not fair!
I’ve been working on this power converter since 1949, and you’d think in
all that time, I could find the right chemicals that would efficiently
convert radiation into electric energy! But no! Thirty three years of
dedication and research, and all I’ve got to show for it is a bootleg
video operation!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: That reminds me, if we could scrape up enough
for a 35 film chain, I’ve got a connection with a projectionist in a
first run house – we could be sellin’ new movies on the street before
they’re even in the theater.</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: A 35mm film chain… I’ll see
what I can do….</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Won’t give up, will you,
Marty?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: One of these days you’re gonna leave this
door open and I’ll find out what’s in there.</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Did you ever consider that
some doors are locked for a reason?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Nope. The way I figure it, doors are made to
be opened. See you after school.</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Oh – Marty – what time did
you say it was?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Eight thirty.</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: AM or PM?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Pro, the sun’s out!</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Oh, right, right…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Jeez, for a guy with a ton of clocks, you
sure don’t pay much attention to time.</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: On the contrary, I may not
pay much attention to the measurement of time, but I’m very aware of
Time itself. I believe time to be its own dimension… to be controlled…
to be contained….</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Catch you later!</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: …To be traveled through</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Morning Dick.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Marty. What’s for breakfast?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Gimme some chili, fries, and a Tab.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Hot tip, Rubber Biscuit in the third race at
Arlington.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Dick, what’s with those guys out there in the
gutter?</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Third time they’ve been out there this
week.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: What’s N.R.C.?</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: I don’t know. National Cash Register?</p>
<p><strong>mr. arky</strong>: There were only three above ground Atomic
Tests in the United States, so the government took every opportunity to
study the effects of radiation. Actual single family tract homes were
constructed on the test site, totally furnished with refrigerators,
TV’s, furniture….</p>
<p><strong>mr. arky</strong>: …Anything you could find in a typical
home, just so scientists could learn what kind of damage an atomic bomb
would do to a typical town. They even put mannequins in the houses, just
like in auto crash tests.</p>
<p><strong>mr. arky</strong>: But the fact remains that today, thirty
years after those early nuclear tests, the threat of nuclear
annihilation is as great as it ever was. Certainly, nuclear annhiliation
is something you all must have thought about. Any questions, comments,
ideas?</p>
<p><strong>mr. arky</strong>: Anyone? I’m talking about the complete and
total destruction of the entire world. Doesn’t anybody have anything to
say about it?</p>
<p><strong>mr. arky</strong>: How about you, Mr. Jackson? he asked,
raising his voice. Would you like to share some of your wisdom with the
class?</p>
<p><strong>mr. arky</strong>: Mr. Gomez? Any thoughts? Miss Parker?
Mr. Crump, any reaction?</p>
<p><strong>mr. arky</strong>: How about you, Mr. McFly?</p>
<p><strong>mr. arky</strong>: Did you even hear the question,
Mr. McFly?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Yeah… You want to know what I think about
atomic bombs. Well, I’d kind of like to see one.</p>
<p><strong>mr. arky</strong>: You’d like to see a nuclear holocaust?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Not a holocaust –</p>
<p><strong>mr. arky</strong>: Mr. McFly here wants to nuke it all, just
so he can see it!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: You know damn well that’s not what I
meant.</p>
<p><strong>mr. arky</strong>: All I can say is, that’s one helluva
attitude, Mr. McFly. ‘Let’s explode a hundred megaton Geothermal nuclear
device, just to see it.’</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Yeah, explode it up your ass!</p>
<p><strong>mr. arky</strong>: Unfortunately, the way things are going,
you may get your wish. You may see the entire annhiliation of the world.
If not, you’ll certainly see the destruction of all out natural
resources. We can already see the air we breathe, not to mention the
pollution in our rivers and lakes. We’ll see all of our oil reserves
depleted, in fact, all of our energy sources. Yes, you people have a lot
to look forward to – a lot to see.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Hey, Mr. Arky, gimme a break! I’m seventeen
years old! I’m not responsible for all these problems!</p>
<p><strong>mr. arky</strong>: No, of course you’re not. Not for the
problems, no. But for the solutions…yes.</p>
<p><strong>mr. arky</strong>: See you tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>rafe newton</strong>: Hey Marty, sport me fifty ’til the
weekend, would ya? I’m down to my last twenty.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Can’t man. I’m savin’ up for that new
amp.</p>
<p><strong>rafe newton</strong>: Well, when you’re a big rock star, how
about loanin’ me a grand?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: You got it! I gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>donaldson</strong>: Hey man, what happened to your digital
quartz?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: In the shop, so I’m sporting this antique.
Check out this wind-up action,</p>
<p><strong>donaldson</strong>: Hey, you wanna come over? Get high?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Maybe tomorrow. I gotta dupe some more
tapes.</p>
<p><strong>donaldson</strong>: Hey, that reminds me – my brother’s
gettin’ married next week and I’m throwin’ a party for him. Can you
provide some entertainment?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Yeah, I can run something off this
afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Hey, Shemp. How ya doin’?</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: What happened?!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Well, I’m not sure exactly – I accidentally
spilled some Coke in here. Just a drop!</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Give me that!</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: What’s in this stuff?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Nobody knows the formula for Coca-Cola. It’s
the most closely guarded secret in the world!</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: I’ll see you tomorrow!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Who stole my drill?</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: Dinner’s ready!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Anybody seen the drill?</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: I’ve been calling you for five minutes!
Didn’t you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I was practicing. I’ve got an audition next
week – I gotta practice. How am I gonna get famous if I don’t
practice?</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: You won’t get famous if you don’t eat,
either!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Dad, you seen the drill?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What drill?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: The drill! The power drill I bought you for
Christmas. I was using it last night.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: It’ll turn up.</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: George, dinner’s ready!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Coming, Eileen!</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: Now, George! Dinner’s ready now!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Coming, Eileen…</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: How was school today?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: Learn anything?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Oh yeah.</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: That’s good.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: How was school today?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Fine..</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Learn anything?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Oh yeah.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: By the way, that reminds me… Saturday night
we’re taking Grandma Stella out for Chinese food.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Eileen, Chinese food again?</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: George, if you don’t want Chinese food, pick
a place you want to go and make a reservation.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: That means he’ll have to pick up the phone,
Ma.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No, Chinese food is fine.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Saturday night’s the ‘Springtime in Paris’
dance. I’m taking Suzy Parker.</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: The ‘Springtime in Paris’ dance. You hear
that, George? They’re still having the ‘Springtime in Paris’ dance… That
was our first date, remember George? I remember everything about that
night. Remember the first time we kissed? It was during the last dance.
They were playing that Eddie Fisher song, ‘Turn Back the Hands of Time’.
I even remember how you asked me out. We were in the cafeteria. You were
so scared, you spilled your creamed corn.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: And I probably won’t be here when you wake up
Sunday morning. Suzy and I are gonna go down to the lake and watch the
sunrise.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: The sunrise? What for?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Jeez, what do you think? To see it!</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: You mean you’re going to stay up all
night?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Mom, how else are we gonna see the
sunrise?</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: I don’t think I like the idea of you staying
out all night with a girl!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Hey, Ma, gimme a break.</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: Would you answer that, George?</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: Well, well, he smirked when Marty opened the
door. If it isn’t the neighborhood bootlegger, Al Capone McFly?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: What do you want, Biff?</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: Show me some respect, you little asshole. It’s
Special Officer Tannen to you.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: The day I show respect to Biff Tannen will be
the day I win a million dollars… What’s the matter, Biff, they’re not
showing you any respect down at the golf course? Don’t they realize what
a tough job it is keeping the criminal element away from the country
club?</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: Listen you little Asshole, I oughta –</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: What do you want, Biff?</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: Where’s your old man?</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: Hey McFly, what’s with this cheap-ass drill
you’re giving me? Thing burned up first time I used it! Almost ruined my
whole engine block!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Uh – Biff… These are wood bits. Says so
right here. You’re not supposed to use them on your engine block.</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: Look, McFly, I know a lot about tools. This is
a cheep-ass drill! You’re just lucky I didn’t ruin my engine block. Next
time you buy tools, let me know. I’ll help you pick out some good
ones.</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: Oh – and one more thing. My kid’s selling Girl
Scout cookies. I told her you were good for four boxes. Don’t make me a
liar!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: How do you like that guy, using wood bits on
an engine block?</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: …He just lets himself get pushed around all
the time! People walk all over him and he never fights back, never
stands up for himself.</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: No self confidence, I guess… At least you
don’t take after him.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Yeah… Jesus! I wonder how he ever got up
enough nerve to marry my mom.</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: Can you imagine your parents in bed
together?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: No way!</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: Me neither. I’ve always wondered whether they
slept together before they got married. You think yours did?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Hell no! The way my mom carries on about sex
– you even mention the word and she goes into cardiac arrest. You
shoulda seen her face when I told her we were gonna stay up all night
Saturday, he added. Always afraid something is going to happen.</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: Is something going to happen Saturday
night?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Wow, you’re good!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Just like riding a bike – you never forget
how to do it.</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: Well… she said slowly. Here we are…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: See you later.</p>
<p><strong>n.r.c. agent reese</strong>: Good evening, one said. Agents
Reese and Foley, from the Nuclear Regulatory Commition. Mind stepping
over here?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: What’s this all about?</p>
<p><strong>n.r.c. agent foley</strong>: Routine radiation check.</p>
<p><strong>n.r.c. agent reese</strong>: Have you got any
identification?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: What, am I radioactive or something?</p>
<p><strong>n.r.c. agent reese</strong>: No, no, not beyond an acceptable
level. Have you been X-rayed recently, Martin?</p>
<p><strong>n.r.c. agent foley</strong>: Perhaps been in contact with
some luminous paint? Foley added.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>n.r.c. agent reese</strong>: Been any place unusual in the
past twelve hours?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Home, school, here…</p>
<p><strong>n.r.c. agent foley</strong>: Been in the vicinity of 2980
Monroe Avenue today? asked Foley.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>n.r.c. agent reese</strong>: Over by the old Orpheum
Theater.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>n.r.c. agent reese</strong>: Okay, Martin. You have a good
evening now.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Yeah, Right.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Professor!</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Get behind that lead
shield!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: But Professor –</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Get behind the shield! I’m
about to release radiation!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Jesus!! Professor, you just disintegrated
Shemp!</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: No, Marty. Shemp’s molecular
structure is completely intact!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Then where the hell is he?</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: The appropriate question to
ask is when the hell is he! You see, Shemp has just become the world’s
first time traveller. I’ve sent Shemp into the future – two minutes into
the future to be exact.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: The future? What are you talking about?
Where’s Shemp?!</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Shemp is right here in this
room…two minutes from now, and at exactly 9:02PM, we’ll catch up to
him.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Now hold on a minute, Professor! Hold the
phone. Are you trying to tell me that this – all of this here – that
this is – it’s a – a –</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: …a time machine.</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: I always knew it would work!
I knew it would work when I built it thirty three years ago. But I was
never able to harness enough power to test it. Power is the key. Massive
amounts of energy to accelerate matter to the speed of light while
creating an intense gravitational field. But generating that kind of
energy has never been possible… until this afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: A time machine! Because of that Coke?!</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Precisely!</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: The power converter, now
operating at peak efficiency, thanks to the chemical makeup of
Coca-Cola, channels energy into the flux capacitor, which releases
several jigowatts in a fraction of a millisecond. Electron acceleration
takes place here… and the result is the temporal displacement beam you
saw a few moments ago. The entire process is triggered when I release
the rope.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I thought that power converter thing operated
on solar energy. There’s no sun,</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Solar energy would have
worked just fine…if I could have placed the converter about a mile from
the surface of the sun. Instead, I’ve created similar conditions in this
reactor here. The higher I raise the cadmium rods, the more energy I
release from the plutonium core, and the further through time I can send
an object.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: The plutonium! That’s what I came over here
for! Professor, where did you get that stuff?</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: I just got stopped in the
street by federal agents checking me for radiation! I figure they’re
after your plutonium!</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Ten seconds!</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Brace yourself for a sudden
displacement of air!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Shemp!</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Exactly two minutes
difference… and it’s still ticking!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Is Shemp all right?</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Of course. Shemp is unaware
that anything even happened, other than his stool suddenly falling over.
We had to wait two minutes to catch up to him, but for Shemp the trip
was instantaneous.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Professor, can this thing send Shemp back in
time?</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Theoretically, yes, if I
were to reverse the polarity.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Jeez, Professor, you’ve got a gold mine
here!</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: A gold mine?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Sure! Listen – we take the racing results
from today’s paper…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Here they are. We send ’em with Shemp back to
yesterday, we get the information, put our money on the winning horses,
and become billionaires!</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Marty, that would alter
history.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: So what? We’d be rich!</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Don’t you understand? The
mere act of sending matter back in time would change the course of
events, and changing history is a responsibility that I do not wish to
bear.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: All I know is you’re throwing away an awful
lot of money.</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: The future, Marty, the
future is everything! I built this machine to see the future. So I am
going to send Shemp twenty-four hours into the future. You can assist
me, if you like.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Sure, he agreed quickly.</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Take this, stand at the
panel. and read off the radiation levels. I want to have a record of
what happens here. Be sure to tell me when we reach 85 rads.</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Come on, Shemp, this won’t
hurt a bit.</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Here we go!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Radiation level, 10 rads.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Stabilization coefficient, .43. 16 rads
coefficient .44. 37 rads, .46. 51 rads, .46. 73 rads, .47…</p>
<p><strong>n.r.c. agent reese</strong>: Everybody freeze! N.R.C.!</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Get back!</p>
<p><strong>n.r.c. agent foley</strong>: Jesus Christ! It’s a Goddamn
reactor!</p>
<p><strong>n.r.c. agent reese</strong>: You! Shut it down! Now!</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: No! . Get out! I’m in the
middle of an experiment!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Professor!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Oh my God! Release the rope! It’s 4200
rads!</p>
<p><strong>n.r.c. agent reese</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Pro! Release the rope!</p>
<p><strong>n.r.c. agent foley</strong>: Freeze!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Damn!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Hey, since when are you open at…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Since when were roast beef sandwiches 30
cents, and an ice cream sunday 15 cents?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Uh, yeah… Gimme a Tab.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: A Tab.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Kid, I can’t give you the tab until you
order something.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Uh, coffee.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Did something happen to you, kid? I mean,
you been lost in the woods or something?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Huh? Say, have you got any Sweet ’N Low?</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Sweet and what? Maybe you’d better pay for
this first.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Sure,.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: A twenty? What do you think this is, a
bank? I can’t break a twenty! Say, what’s a kid your age doing with all
this money?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Look, maybe I’d better talk to Dick. Is he
around?</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Dick? Dick who?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Now who’s being stupid? The guy who runs this
place.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: I run this place!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: What happened to Dick Wilson?</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Dick Wilson? Dickie Wilson? Dickie Wilson
runs this place? That’s a laugh!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: What are you trying to do? Freak me out, or
something?</p>
<p><strong>man with coffee</strong>: Freak?</p>
<p><strong>man with coffee</strong>: Are you from some circus? Is that
what all that writing on your clothes means?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Haven’t you ever heard of designer
labels?</p>
<p><strong>dickie</strong>: Mommy, I’m hungry, he whined.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Just take a candy bar, then go to bed,
Dickie.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Dickie? That’s Dick Wilson?</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: That’s Dick Wilson.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: 1952? This is 1952?! Holy shit! You know what
this means? I’ve gone back in time thirty years! Thirty Goddamn years! I
haven’t even been born yet!</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: I’m calling the cops.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Dammit!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: 1952! God dammit!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: 1952! Dammit!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Dammit!</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Operator…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Operator! Listen, this is an emergency! I
have to make this call, but I don’t have a dime – all I got is a nickel
– but you gotta connect me –</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Sir, it only costs a nickel.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Local calls cost five cents. What number
do you want?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Oh – right! Uh, Madison 3489.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Five cents, please.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: I’m sorry, there’s no answer.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Operator, what’s today’s date?</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: March 11th.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: What year?</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Nineteen fifty –</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Dammit!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: My house!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Mom!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Mom! Open up! It’s me!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Mom, thank God! Thank God you’re here!</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: I bed your pardon, young man?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Mom! It’s me! Marty! Don’t you know your own
son!</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: I think you have the wrong house.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: No – no – it’s not! It’s not!</p>
<p><strong>mr. baines</strong>: Who’s there, Stella?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Stella!? No! Don’t tell me you’re Stella!
Tell me you’re Eileen! Please tell me you’re Eileen!</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: I’m Eileen.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: How old are you?</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: Seventeen.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Professor? Professor Brown?</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: You know me?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Professor, you time machine works! It works!
It sent me back in time! I’m from 1982!</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Ssshhhhh!</p>
<p><strong>mr. baines</strong>: Is he all right?</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: He will be. Simple
inebriation, is all. The young man must have a rather low tolerance for
alcohol… something that runs in the family. You see, he’s a second
cousin of mine on my mother’s side. Came quite a distance to visit me,
he added. His name’s Lewis.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Marty.</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Uh, Marty Lewis! I almost
didn’t recognize him – haven’t seen him in years.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: It’s a good thing he had your name circled
in the phone book. I would have called the police.</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Well, Mrs. Baines,
Mr. Baines, thank you for your trouble. Both Marty and I apologize for
the inconvenience. We’ll get him home and as good as new.</p>
<p><strong>mr. baines</strong>: Son, you watch yourself!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: Here’s your jacket!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Uh, thanks…</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: What kind of material is this? I’ve never
seen anything like it.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: It’s polyester.</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: Poly-what?</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: It’s an experimental
invention of mine. Sort of a rubberized silver- foil. I just made up a
name for it. Come on, Marty. We’ve got a lot to talk about.</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: Marty?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: Have we ever met before?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: …and the flux capacitor is hooked into this
thing that looks like a condenser with a lense on it…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Jeez – this is where you used to live, huh?
You must have been rich!</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Must have been? Used to
live? I do live here.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Well, there’s a mall here now – I mean, there
will be.</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: A mall?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Yeah, a shopping mall. You know, a shopping
mall?</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Ssshhhhh – don’t tell me
these things, Marty. I don’t want to know about the future.</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Do you see it here?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: You’ve convinced me that you
must be who you say you are. No living human has ever seen this machine.
But why? Why even in my twilight years would I remotely consider sending
someone back in time?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: You didn’t, Professor. It was an accident!
You see, what happened –</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: No! Don’t tell me! I don’t
want to know the future! My knowledge of future events… your mere
presence here… could have devastating effects on the course of history.
And altering history is a responsibility that I do not wish to bear. My
immediate response is to send you back to your own time.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I can dig that.</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Pardon me?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Oh. That expression probably hasn’t been
invented yet… I can get behind – I agree with you.</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Hello? Yes Charles, yes, I
looked over the offer. It’s very generous that they want to make me a
major stockholder. But I’m just not interested in a position with this
little X-rox corporation… If it’s pronounced ‘Zerox’, why don’t they
spell it with a Z?… Look, I’m on the verge of a breakthrough on my power
converter.</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: …Well, any day now. And then
I’ll need people to work for Emmett Brown Industries! I’ve got a lot of
ideas that are going to create a lot of jobs. Very well, good night,
Charles.</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: The X-rox Corporation. How
are they going to sell a product if you can’t even pronounce the
name?</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Now… the time machine works,
that’s obvious. As I’ve always known, it’s a question of power. Where
did I – will I get enough power to send a man thirty years through
time?</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: No – wait – don’t tell
me!</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: On second thought, there may
be some things you’ll have to tell me.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: The power converter…</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Of course! The power
converter! It works! Of course, it works… What chemicals do we use?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Well, Professor, are you sure you want me to
tell you? You know, changing the course of history and all….</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Blast it – no, I suppose
you’re right…. You do know the proper chemical formula?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Sure, and there won’t be any problem getting
some – Getting it…</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Coke?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: How did you know?</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Just a guess. I figured kids
would still be drinking Coke in 1982.</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: All right, then it’s very
simple, Tomorrow, weather permitting, you’ll get the chemicals, and
we’ll wire the power converter to the time machine, point it at the sun,
and send you home.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Professor. Well, not exactly, Professor. You
see, we don’t point it at the sun.</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: We don’t….</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: We need a nuclear reactor.</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: A nuclear reactor! How much
energy do we need?</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: 4200 rads? Good God!</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: There’s something I still
don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Fascinating device, he
commented as it spun back.</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: These loud bangs… could
those be some sort of malfunction in the time machine? Do you know what
they are?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I wouldn’t worry about ’em, Professor.</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: 4200 rads… That certainly
can’t be generated under controlled conditions in this day and age.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: That’s just great!</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: However…there’s a lot I
don’t know about nuclear physics. So first think in the morning, I’ll go
to the University and see what I can find out. I want you to stay in the
house, It’s very important that you don’t interfere in any way with the
outside world. I’ve got plenty of food, there’s the radio, books,
magazines… I’ve even got one of those new television sets. There’s
plenty to do.</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: How do you open these?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: It doesn’t look good, does it, Professor?</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: At the moment, it looks like
you’re stuck here.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Eisenhower…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Aha!</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: You answered the door!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: You were ringing the doorbell!</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: I told you not to interfere
with any of the events of this time! Nobody’s supposed to see you here!
What if I was a mailman? Or a salesman?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: What if you lost your keys?</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Then I would have figured
out to get back in through the events in the natural course of history!
Don’t you understand? The fabric of history is very delicate. Anything
you do could have serious consequences!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Hey, look, gimme a break! All I did was
answer the door! How’s that gonna change history?</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: I don’t know, but I don’t
want to take any chances! Now you stay here and don’t do anything. Don’t
answer the door, don’t answer the phone, don’t go outside.
Understand?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Hey, get off my case, would you? I didn’t
want to come here, and the only reason I’m here in the first place is
because I was a nice guy, helping you out. So don’t tell me I gotta stay
cooped up in here and vege out, because none of this is my fault!</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Let me put it on a level you
can understand. You don’t belong here. You don’t know anything about
this world. You don’t know the customs, you don’t know how to talk, how
to act – you don’t even look like you belong here. And if you walked out
on the street, you wouldn’t get 100 yards without being arrested. Then
there would be questions, and where would we come up with the
answers?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Okay, Professor, I get where you’re coming
from. The way I look, the way I’m dressed… I’d stick out like a sore
thumb.</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: I’m glad we finally got that
straightened out. I’ll see you tonight.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Are they kidding?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Can I help you, sir?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: This… is the number one single?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Yes, sir!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I don’t get it. How come there’s no rock ’n
roll?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: I beg your pardon?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: This is 1952….?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Uh, yes, sir…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: And you never heard of rock ’n roll?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: No….</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Well, maybe it’s time you did.</p>
<p><strong>pawnbroker</strong>: Hey, what kinda funny money is this?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: It says ‘1977’ on it. What do you take me
for, an idiot?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Oh – yeah.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I can’t believe I did that. That’s a joke. My
friend had these printed up – see that’s his name there… Blumenthal.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Gee - I don’t seem to have anything on
me.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Hey, how about this watch? It’s a genuine
antique!</p>
<p><strong>pawnbroker</strong>: Antique? They just came out with this
watch last month. But this one looks like it’s been through a war.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Yeah, I’ve been doing a lotta travelling.</p>
<p><strong>pawnbroker</strong>: Okay kid. You got a deal. The watch for
the guitar.</p>
<p><strong>talent agent</strong>: Well kid, it’s interesting, I’ll say
that. But it’s not commercial.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Not commercial? Mister, don’t you know what
you’re listening to? This is rock ’n roll!</p>
<p><strong>talent agent</strong>: Call it what you want to kid, but
don’t call it music, ’cause it sure ain’t that!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: But you don’t understand –</p>
<p><strong>talent agent</strong>: No buts, kid. I’ve been in this
business my whole life and I know what people want. The smooth sound,
that’s what sells. Como, Crosby, Dinah Shore. Gimme a melody and a nice
slow tempo. Now beat it!</p>
<p><strong>reginald washington</strong>: That sound I just heard coming
through the door, that was like nothing I ever heard before! I mean, you
got something there, young man!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: At least one person had recognized rock’n
roll for what it was! Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>reginald washington</strong>: Reginald Washington is my name.
I manage some of the local bands around town and I think you’ve got
something we can promote all the way to the top! Now, I’ve got a real
important cat comin’ in from a New York record company on Monday the
18th, and I want you to play that music for him. I think the time has
come for a sound like that.</p>
<p><strong>reginald washington</strong>: That’s March 18th, Noon. Be at
my office. What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Marty Mc - Marty Lewis.</p>
<p><strong>reginald washington</strong>: Marty Lewis. See you on the
18th.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: This is great! Right on, brother!</p>
<p><strong>reginald washington</strong>: I think you’re a little mixed
up. There is absolutely no way that I could be your brother.</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Well, I found an energy
source that can generate the 4200 rads that we need….</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: An atomic bomb.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Professor, be serious, would you?</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: I am serious. If we could
get you, the time machine, and the power converter in the vicinity of an
atomic blast, we could send you back to the future.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: You’re talking crazy! An atomic blast would
melt me and the time machine in a matter of seconds!</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: You forget – time travel is
instantaneous. The time machine would melt, but you would have already
travelled through time. Of course, it’s a moot point regardless. The
only place atomic bombs are detonated is at the Army’s Nevada Test Site,
and those tests are kept absolutely top secret.</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Marty, what’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Oh – nothin’. I thought I left the water
running.</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Say, where did this guitar
come from?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Oh – that – I found it in the closet.</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: I don’t recall ever seeing
it before.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Well, it was there.</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Curious… Very curious….</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: So you wanna be a rock ’n roll star…</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Look, Professor! I’m not –
oh!</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: Hi, Marty.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Uh, hi….</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Right. Eileen.</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: You remember me…?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: How could I forget? Oh, sure, I remember
you.</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: Well, I was on my way to school, and I just
wanted to stop by and see if you were feeling okay. You seemed like you
were in pretty bad shape the other night.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Oh, I’m feeling much better now.</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: How long are you planning on staying?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Actually, it looks like I’m gonna be stuck
here for awhile.</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: Then you’ll be going to school here….?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: School? I never thought of school! If I went
to school I could blend in with everybody else, couldn’t I?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: What time does school start around here?</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: Nine o’ clock. Oh, I’m late! Maybe I’ll see
you later.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Yeah. Maybe so.</p>
<p><strong>mr. arky</strong>: What are you doing in this class?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Mr. Arky?</p>
<p><strong>mr. arky</strong>: Yes, that’s my name. Who are you, young
man? Are you supposed to be here?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Uh – yeah. I’m new here, and I’m supposed to
be in this class.</p>
<p><strong>mr. arky</strong>: You have a name?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Marty. Marty Lewis.</p>
<p><strong>mr. arky</strong>: …and it is, of course, due to science that
we Americans enjoy the highest standard of living in the history of the
world. When we think of the technological advances made in just the past
thirty years, it boggles the mind to imagine what the world will be like
in another thirty years. I think I can safely say that we can all look
forward to a world of plenty, a world free of disease and starvation.
There’ll be entire cities built under the sea, cars that can go two or
three hundred miles an hour.</p>
<p><strong>mr. arky</strong>: You girls will be able to cook an entire
meal, clean the entire house, and do all of your laundry and ironing by
push button, the science teacher went on. You may even have a robot to
assist you in all your duties as a wife.</p>
<p><strong>student</strong>: I hope those robots won’t be assisting in
all my wife’s duties!</p>
<p><strong>mr. arky</strong>: Well, Biff, since you seem so eager to get
into this discussion, perhaps you’d like to tell us what you think
you’ll be doing in thirty years?</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: I know what I won’t be doin’, he said with a
smirk on his face. Goin’ to school!</p>
<p><strong>gums</strong>: Hey, Biff, good one!</p>
<p><strong>skinhead</strong>: Ataway, Biff!</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: What are you lookin’ at, asshole?</p>
<p><strong>mr. arky</strong>: Anybody else have any ideas about what
life might be like in thirty years?</p>
<p><strong>mr. arky</strong>: Mr. Cusimano? Miss Voyles? Miss Kaner? So
am I to understand that no one has anything at all to say about the
future? How about you, Mr. McFly?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Oh shit…!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, I, uh….well….</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Jesus Christ! Dad!</p>
<p><strong>mr. arky</strong>: Continue, Mr. McFly.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, I – uh – could you repeat the
question?</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: Sit down, McFly, you stupid moron! I can’t
see!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Hey, lay off!</p>
<p><strong>mr. arky</strong>: Did you say something, Mr. Lewis?</p>
<p><strong>mr. arky</strong>: Mr. Lewis, I’m talking to you!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Who, me?</p>
<p><strong>mr. arky</strong>: You’re the only Mr. Lewis in this class.
If you have something to say, say it so the whole class can hear.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Well, yeah, I was thinking, if cars are gonna
be going two or three hundred miles an hour, they’re gonna be using an
awful lot of gas. Like, what if we run out?</p>
<p><strong>mr. arky</strong>: Run out of gas?</p>
<p><strong>mr. arky</strong>: Well, class, it seems we have a doomsayer
in our midst. I must say, Mr. Lewis, that’s a mighty pessimistic
attitude for a young man like yourself. First of all, with all the
studies we have indicating the vast supplies of petroleum in the earth,
plus the massive reserves that have yet to be discovered, the likelihood
of any such shortage is highly remote. And even if the most improbable,
catastrophic circumstances were to occur and we did have a shortage of
petroleum, I’m sure that American technology and ingenuity would
overcome the problem in no time at all. All in all, I’d say your time
would be better spent worrying about the real problems that face our
world, instead of a shortage of gasoline.</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: Hey, we got plenty of gas back here!</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: Hi, George.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Eileen, if you’re free Saturday night… No…
Eileen, would you like to go to the dance… no…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Uh, Eileen?</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: Hi, George.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Eileen, could I ask you something?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Ooops –!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Uh, well, the thing is, that is, what I
wanted to ask you….</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: Marty! Hi, Marty! Over here!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh God! Excuse me, please!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Wait a minute – aren’t you gonna ask her to
the dance? That was what was supposed to have happened, wasn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Huh? How did you know?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Go ahead, George. Ask her.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Leave me alone!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: You’ve gotta ask her to the dance!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Not now….</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: Is that what you were going to ask me,
George? To go to the dance?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: George! Wait! Get back here! You’re not
supposed to run off! It doesn’t happen that way!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Oh, God, this is all wrong!</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: What’s all wrong?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: George! He’s supposed to ask you to the
dance!</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: But he didn’t ask me.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: But he does! Don’t you see?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: He comes out of the cafeteria line, he’s
nervous, he spills his corn, and he asks you to the dance!</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: Marty, you haven’t been listening. Nobody’s
asked me to the dance…yet.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: You did what?!?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I didn’t mean to do it – it was an
accident!</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Do you realize what that
means? Do you have any idea what that means?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Look, it’s not a big deal! I can fix it! All
I gotta do is get ’em together and make sure my old man asks her
out!</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: You better make sure your
old man asks her out, because if he doesn’t, they may never have a first
date. And if they don’t have a first date, they won’t have a second
date. If they don’t have a second date, they won’t fall in love. If they
don’t fall in love, they won’t get married, and if they don’t get
married, you’ll never be born!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Well, maybe everything is a little worse then
I first thought, he realized.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I don’t know if I can go through with
this!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: George, she’s beautiful, right? She’s nice,
she’s decent, she’s the kind of girl you’d like to marry, right? And
there’s nothing in the world you’d like more than to take her to that
dance, right?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well… yeah…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Okay, then!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Wait a minute – who are you, anyway? What
are you doing this for?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Let’s just say I have a vested interest in
you and Eileen going to this dance, all right? Look, There she is…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Go in there and invite her.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What do I say?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Say what you were supposed to say in the
cafeteria.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh, no! That was for the cafeteria! This is
different!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Christ, it’s a miracle I was even born!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Nothing. Look, I’ll write it down for you,
okay?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What is that? A pencil that writes in
ink?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: It was Marty’s turn to be confused. Huh?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Lemme see that.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: ‘Bike fine point?’</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Bic… It’s a Bic pen.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Fill it with ink? You don’t fill it – oh come
on, George!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: There she is, he said in a low voice. Just go
and ask her. I’ll be sitting right here.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Gimme a strawberry malted</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: Hi, George!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Uh, hi, Eileen.</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: How are you?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh – I’m all right. Say, listen, about this
dance Saturday night –</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: Hey, McFly, I thought I told you never to come
in here!</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: Well, it’s gonna cost you, McFly. How much
money you got on you?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: How much do you want, Biff?</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: Listen, asshole, he growled, it’s about time I
taught you a lesson.</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: In the car!</p>
<p><strong>madge</strong>: Did you see that?</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: I’m gonna get that son of a bitch!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Professor, you were right about everything. I
don’t belong here. I almost screwed up my existence again today while I
was trying to put it back together, and I’ve had enough. I want to go
back to the future.</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Where did you get this?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I brought it with me from 1982. It’s from my
science book.</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: The test is this Monday! 15
megatons… Let’s see, we need 4200 rads… You’d have to be…exactly 800
yards from ground zero… You realize that what we’re going to do could be
extremely dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Believe me, Professor, running around on a
nuclear test site can’t be any more dangerous than what I’ve been
doing.</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: All right, here’s what we’ll
do: we’ll get an Army Surplus Truck, mount the time machine and power
converter on it, and drive it to Nevada. If we leave by Saturday night,
we can make it to the test site in plenty of time. And just to be on the
safe side, I’d better build a lead-lined time chamber for your added
protection. I don’t know if I trust these atomic bombs.</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Hello? Uh, no, Eileen, he
can’t come to the phone right now.</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: All right. Yes, I’ll tell
him… Good-bye.</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Your ‘mother’ wanted me to
tell you that she was very impressed by what you did this afternoon, and
that if you were interested in going to the dance Saturday, she’s
available.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: But that’s impossible!! George asked her out!
He had to! I saw him walk her home! Oh, God!</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: My guess is that she turned
him down.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: But why? Why would she do that? She’s
supposed to marry the guy!</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Apparently, what has
happened is that the maternal instinct has transcended the gap of time
and this has caused an alteration in your mother’s emotional
behavior.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Are you trying to tell me that my mother’s
got the hots for me?</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: In a manner of speaking,
yes. And because of that, she’s no longer interested in your father.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: What are we gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: How ya doing, Eileen?</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: Hi, Marty!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Listen, Professor Brown told me you called
last night and gave me your message…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: …and if you’re still available, I’d like to
take you to the dance Saturday night, so I’ll pick you up around 8:30,
okay?</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: Okay. See you later, Marty.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Come on, George,</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Don’t be such a chicken. Hit me in the
stomach. Right here, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I don’t want to hit you in the stomach!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: You’re not gonna hurt me. Just hit me in the
stomach.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Look, Marty, I’m just not a fighter…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: How many times do I have to explain it to
you?… We know you’re not a fighter. You know it, I know it… but she
doesn’t know it. That’s why we gotta make you look like a fighter,
somebody who’ll stand up for her, somebody who isn’t chicken. And you’re
not gonna look like a fighter if you can’t hit me in the stomach.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: But I’ve never picked a fight in my entire
life!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: You’re not picking a fight, you’re coming to
her rescue. Maybe we’d better go over the plan again. Where are you
gonna be at 8:55?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’m going to be at the dance.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: And where am I gonna be?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: In the parking lot, with her.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Okay. So right around 9:00 she’s gonna get
very angry with me -</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Why what?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Why is she gonna get angry with you?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Well… because… Well, nice girls get angry at
guys who…who try to take advantage of ’em.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You mean, you’re gonna –</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: George it’s not your concern. Don’t worry
about it. Just remember that at 9:00, you’ll be strolling through the
parking lot and you’ll see us – struggling in the car, you’ll run over,
open the door and say….?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Your line, George!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh. Uh… ‘Hey, you! Get your damn hands off
her!’ George paused. You really think I should swear?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Yes, definitely, god dammit George, swear.
Then you hit me in the stomach, I go down for the count, and you and
Eileen life happily ever after. Now, hit me in the stomach.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No, George, put a little emotion into it. A
little hostility, a little anger.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Anger, George, Anger.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Maybe if I used my left….</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: No, George, just concentrate on the anger.
Anger.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Well, I think you’re starting to get the hang
of it. Just keep practicing. I’ll see you tonight. Remember, anger,
George. Anger.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Anger…anger…. he muttered.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeeeowww! God dammit!</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Everything’s ready to go,
securing the tarp carefully. What about the chemicals for the power
converter… whatever they are?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: That’s all taken care of.</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Good. Professor Brown tested
the tarp, noting in satisfaction that it was secure. I’ll pick you up in
front of the school at midnight. Don’t be late – we’re cutting it close
as it is. We’ve got a long drive ahead of us.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Look. I’m a little worried about this – this
whole thing with my mother, he admitted to the Professor. I mean, I
don’t know if I can do it – I mean, hitting on my own mother, that’s
pretty heavy.</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Nobody said anything about
hitting her! You’re just going to take a few liberties with her.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: That’s exactly what I said! I mean, a guy and
his mother – that’s illegal, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Look, Marty, she’s not your
mother yet. And if you don’t go through with this, she may never be. I
know it’s hard, but there are some things we must do in life that are
unpleasant. Some choices must be made that are difficult. Nonetheless,
we must make them. Besides, this may be more than a simple question of
your own existence, he added. The fate of the entire space-time
continuum may rest on your shoulders . Marty tried to smile at him.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: That’s just what I needed to hear.</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: It’ll be fine, Marty. You’ll
be fine. Good luck. He stuck his hand out and Marty shook it. But there
was still a question that was nagging at him…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Professor, if something does go wrong
tonight… if I don’t get my parents back together… when do you think I’d
cease to exist?</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: There’s no way of
knowing.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Perfect…</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: It could happen at the
moment you arrive back in the future, theoretically, it could happen at
the moment of your birth…or conception. Actually, it could happen at any
time. It’s a question to which I hope we’ll never learn the answer.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Amen.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Uh… let’s just sit here for a few
minutes…</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: Are you all right, Marty? You seem a
little…nervous.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Oh, no, I’m fine…fine.</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: I’m usually nervous myself on first
dates…but not tonight. It’s funny, but somehow, I feel like….like I know
you.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Uh, yeah, well, believe me, I sure feel like
I know you!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What time do you have?</p>
<p><strong>nearby student</strong>: Five after nine.</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: Why are you so nervous?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Well, Eileen…jeez, that’s hard for me to say.
Have you ever been in a situation where – well – you know you have to
act a certain way, but when you get there, you don’t know if you can go
through with it?</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: You mean like how you’re supposed to act
with someone on a first date?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Well, sort of….</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: I think I know exactly what you mean.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: You do?</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: And you know what I do in those
situations?</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: I don’t worry about it!</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: This isn’t right.</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: I don’t know what it is, but…when I kiss
you…something’s wrong. It almost feels like…like I was kissing my
brother…or my father…. I don’t understand it, but I just know it’s
wrong. I guess that doesn’t make any sense, does it?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Believe me, it makes perfect sense.</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: Sounds like somebody’s coming.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Not now, George! Not now….</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: I been lookin’ for you, asshole, the bully
growled in a low voice.</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: Let go of him!</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: Leave him alone!</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: Look at what we have here!</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: Eileen – I didn’t know you were that kinda
girl!</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: I’m not!</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: Oh no, you don’t!</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: Take him around back. I’ll join you in a
minute.</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: Go on! This ain’t no peepshow!</p>
<p><strong>reginald washington</strong>: Hey! What’s going on there?</p>
<p><strong>gums</strong>: Beat it, black boy!</p>
<p><strong>reginald washington</strong>: Hey, now, you’d better –</p>
<p><strong>skinhead</strong>: Listen, spook, you lookin’ for
trouble?</p>
<p><strong>reginald washington</strong>: No, sir, I don’t want no
trouble.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hey, you! he said forcefully. Get your damn
hands – uh oh!</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: I think you got the wrong car, McFly.</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: George! Help me!</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: Just close the door, McFly, and walk away.</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: George! Please! Help me!</p>
<p><strong>band member</strong>: Who you callin’ ‘spook’,
peckerwood?!</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: All right, McFly, I asked you politely to
leave. Now I’m gonna have to teach you a lesson!</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Did you see that?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Kid’s got the greatest left hook since Jo
Louis! Laid ’im out cold with one punch!</p>
<p><strong>onlooker</strong>: Somebody better call an ambulance.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Hey, thanks a lot, you guys,</p>
<p><strong>band member</strong>: It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Well, you guys go back in there and play the
best version of ‘Turn Back the Hands of Time’ that you can, glancing
towards the door.</p>
<p><strong>band member 2</strong>: Sorry, my friend, we’re through for
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>drummer</strong>: Look at Lester’s hand. He smashed it on top
of old Skinhead. We can’t play without Lester.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: But you guys have to play! The dance isn’t
over yet! You gotta play ‘Turn Back the Hands of Time’. My parents gotta
– George, Eileen gotta dance the last dance and kiss!</p>
<p><strong>band member</strong>: Hey, man, the dance is over…unless you
can find somebody who can play the guitar.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Well, folks, that about wraps it up for this
evening….</p>
<p><strong>students</strong>: Aww, one more! Just one more!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: You want one more, huh?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Well, I probably shouldn’t do this, but what
the hell, you’re gonna be hearing a lot of this in the future anyway…
Follow me, fellas, he told the band members.</p>
<p><strong>old teacher</strong>: That’s right, officer, there’s a riot
in the school gym!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Good night, everybody!</p>
<p><strong>reginald washington</strong>: Man, that stuff cooks! That’s
the hottest sound I ever heard! You gotta play that Monday for that
record company cat from New York!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I won’t be there Monday.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: And don’t you guys play it either, he
cautioned. It’s time hasn’t come yet. If you play it, you might screw
things up. It’ll happen on it’s own.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Rock’n roll!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Everything’s cool. They danced, they kissed,
they’re in love! Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I sure wish I could have seen the punch!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I mean, he decked him – laid him out cold –
one punch. It must have been beautiful! I didn’t know he had it in
him!</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: You didn’t?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Nope. My father’s never clenched a fist in
his entire life!</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Curious… Very curious.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I just wish I could have seen it…</p>
<p><strong>gas attendant</strong>: Twenty six gallons, checking the
readouts. That’ll be $3.75.</p>
<p><strong>m.p.</strong>: Where do you jokers think you’re going? he
asked, peering into the cab.</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: We’re here to deliver that
refrigerator.</p>
<p><strong>m.p.</strong>: Do you know where you are?</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: This is where they’re gonna
drop the bomb, right? Well, Philco wants to find out what it does to
their refrigerator.</p>
<p><strong>m.p.</strong>: What’s with the motorcycle?</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: General Motors wants to find
out what it does to their truck. The motorcycle is because we don’t want
to find out what it does to us.</p>
<p><strong>m.p.</strong>: Well, you better shake a leg. That bomb goes
off in fifty-five minutes!</p>
<p><strong>colonell nordell</strong>: Lieutenant, what’s that vehicle
doing down there?</p>
<p><strong>colonell nordell</strong>: From Philco? Jesus H. Christ! How
many refrigerators do we have to blow up in this test?</p>
<p><strong>timekeeper</strong>: Coming up on exactly 30 minutes to
detonation. Lock all timing circuits…now.</p>
<p><strong>technition</strong>: Mark!</p>
<p><strong>second technition</strong>: Check arming circuits!</p>
<p><strong>major lanza</strong>: Final evacuation check!</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant jones</strong>: Roger!</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: There it is – Ground Zero…
and your target is 800 yards.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: It was sure nice of Uncle Sam to put those
yardage markers up for us.</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: We’re at one and a half
miles, so you’re just a little over a mile from where you want to be,
Wait until minus 3 minutes before you go – that should give you plenty
of time, and it should be close enough to zero hour that they can’t do
anything to stop you. Park the truck at 800 and get in the refri– the
time chamber. Just be sure the nose of the truck is pointed at the
bomb….the power converter will do the rest.</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Here’s a walkie-talkie, I’ll
be on this frequency. This one’s the Army.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: T minus 28 minutes, and counting.</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: I’d better go! Good luck,
Marty.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Thanks for everything, Pro.</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Professor Brown grinned. I
guess I’ll see you in… about 30 years.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Uh… yeah… I hope so.</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Is something wrong?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: It’s just always so hard for me to say
goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Marty, I know I’ve
repeatedly asked you not to tell me anything about the future,
but….well, those loud bangs on the tape recorder….are they….</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Professor – there are some doors that
shouldn’t be opened, Marty said softly, without turning around.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: T minus 27 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant glass</strong>: There go those two lovers who
brought the refrigerator.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: The ‘fabulous fifties,’</p>
<p><strong>timekeeper</strong>: T-minus fourteen minutes.</p>
<p><strong>technition</strong>: Lock all arming circuits.</p>
<p><strong>second technition</strong>: Preliminary arming circuits
locked.</p>
<p><strong>third technition</strong>: Main arming circuits locked.</p>
<p><strong>fourth technition</strong>: Auxiliary arming circuits
locked.</p>
<p><strong>captain teague</strong>: You are here to witness one of the
most spectacular sights in the history of man, he said. It is really
quite beautiful. There will be an intense white fireball that will
recede into a bright yellow glow, accompanied by an intense shock
wave….</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: T-minus 7 minutes. 7 minutes until final
detonation.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: T-minus 6 minutes and counting…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: …5 minutes and counting…</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Calling Marty! Do you read
me?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I read you, Pro.</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Is everything set? Have you
put the formula in the power converter?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I’m on my way to do that right now.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Professor! I can’t find the formula! I left
it in my jacket, and my jacket’s gone!</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Oh my God!</p>
<p><strong>timekeeper</strong>: T-minutes 3 minutes, 30 seconds…</p>
<p><strong>technition</strong>: Released safety switches! First
Safety.</p>
<p><strong>second technition</strong>: First safety released.</p>
<p><strong>third technition</strong>: First safety released!</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Marty, it’s over. Do you
understand? It’s over. Now I want you to get in the refrig– the time
chamber, and we’ll just pray that the lead lining –</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Don’t worry about a thing! There’s plenty of
formula in the refrigerator!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: T-minutes 2 minutes, 50 seconds.</p>
<p><strong>timekeeper</strong>: T minus 2 minutes…</p>
<p><strong>technition</strong>: Release second safely!</p>
<p><strong>second technition</strong>: Second safety released!</p>
<p><strong>third technition</strong>: Second safety released!</p>
<p><strong>colonel nordell</strong>: Jesus! What’s that truck doing out
there?</p>
<p><strong>captain teague</strong>: He’s heading straight for the
bomb!</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant glass</strong>: He’s gotta be a Commie spy –
trying to sabotage the test!</p>
<p><strong>colonel nordell</strong>: Captain! Get your men on this
artillery and blow that truck to Kingdom Come!</p>
<p><strong>captain teague</strong>: Men, get on this artillery and blow
that truck to Kingdom Come! Fire mission! Let’s move!</p>
<p><strong>sargent gunther</strong>: Captain! Give us some
coordinates!</p>
<p><strong>captain teague</strong>: I don’t have any! We’ll have to fire
direct!</p>
<p><strong>captain teague</strong>: Fire!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>captain teague</strong>: Drop 5 elevation, add 8
deflection!</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Oh my God! he cried, feeling
helpless to do anything.</p>
<p><strong>timekeeper</strong>: One minute, fifteen seconds!</p>
<p><strong>technition</strong>: Release final safety.</p>
<p><strong>second technition</strong>: Final safety released!</p>
<p><strong>third technition</strong>: Final safety released!</p>
<p><strong>sergeant gunther</strong>: Drop 2 elevation, minus 3
deflection.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Exactly one minute till detonation! the voice
said. 59….58….</p>
<p><strong>colonel nordell</strong>: He’s stopped, Captain! Right at the
800 yard marker!</p>
<p><strong>captain teague</strong>: We’ll get him for sure this time!
Add 1 and a half elevation! he added to his men.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: …53…52….</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Hurry up!</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Move the truck! They’re
gonna draw a bead on you!</p>
<p><strong>sergeant gunther</strong>: I’ve got a bead on him!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: ..47…46…</p>
<p><strong>captain teague</strong>: FIRE!</p>
<p><strong>timekeeper</strong>: T-minus 30 seconds! the voice from
detonation control said.</p>
<p><strong>colonel nordell</strong>: Everybody into the bunker! Take
cover! Now!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: ….24….23….22…</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Come on, Marty! Come on!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: ….20…19….18…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: …14…13…12…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: …9…8…7…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: …5…4…3…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: …2…1…</p>
<p><strong>timekeeper</strong>: Detonate!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Marty! You’re here! Right on
time! How are you? Feeling okay?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: What year is this?</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: 1982! March 18, just like we
planned! My calculations were absolutely correct! Thirty years! God, I
cannot believe it’s been thirty years! Sure, it was a long time ago –
longest I’ve ever had to wait for the results of an experiment!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: And you’re alive, Professor? You weren’t
shot?</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Shot? Who’d want to shoot
me? I’ve never felt better in my life!</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Hop in, Marty, . We’ve got a
long drive ahead of us.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: What do you call this?</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: A car.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Professor… You peaked, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Yeah. I figured, what the
hell!</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: You see, I never rebuilt the
time machine after it was destroyed in 1952. I decided that
experimenting with time and possibly changing history was too risky.
Anyway, experiments in time travel were banned in all 87 states after
the governor of Cuba caught Dr. Felstien fooling around in the Bermuda
Triangle – that was back in ’64.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: 87 states? Time travel bans? What the
hell?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: But if you didn’t rebuild the time machine,
how did I go back in time in the first place?</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: According to your
girlfriend, Suzy Parker, you and she were at the movies. You went to the
restroom and you never came out. Obviously, you stepped through an
inter-dimensional time warp, created by the original operation of the
time machine.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Obviously!</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: But I told everyone your
disappearance was due to a teleportation experiment you were helping me
with. So don’t mention anything about time travel to anyone.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: What theater was I at?</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: The Orpheum.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Wow! Look at that city!</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Pretty, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: It’s the most beautiful city I’ve ever seen!
What is it?</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Cleveland.</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: Go on in, I’ll be with you
as soon as I adjust this blasted flow capacitor.</p>
<p><strong>robot</strong>: Greetings, Master Martin. Let me take your
coat.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Right….</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: Marty! You’re back! I’m so glad to see
you!</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: Where did you get these silly clothes?</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: Sparky, get Marty some clean clothes.</p>
<p><strong>robot</strong>: Yes, Madam.</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: Your father’s in the study. Say hello to
him.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Welcome home, son!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: The Professor told us what happened with the
experiment – that there might be some side effects… lapses of
memory.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Your mom’s got one heckuva dinner planned
tonight! She’s been pushing buttons all day!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hey, Biff! What are you doing, sleeping on
the job? A security guard’s supposed to be alert!</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: Yes, sir, Mr. McFly!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What am I paying you fifty cents an hour
for?</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: I’m sorry, Champ, It won’t happen again,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: What are you doing, Dad?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What’s it look like I’m doing, son? I’m
paying the fuel bill. It’s over $2.00 this month – we really oughta try
to cut down.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What’s wrong, son? You act like you’ve never
seen a Write-O-Matic before.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Say, what have you got there? An antique
pen? Let me see that! He took it from Marty and examined it carefully. I
haven’t seen one of these in….well, this is strange. How do you fill it
with ink?</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: Marty, there’s someone here to see you.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Suzy!</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: Hi, Marty!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: What did you do to your hair?</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: What did you do to yours?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hey, how’s my favorite girl?</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: Fine, Mr. McFly.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Why don’t you two get out of here – I’m sure
you can find something better to do than watch me pay bills!</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: Marty, you’d better change your clothes. You
can’t go to Mambo Class looking like that.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Mambo class? You mean people still do the
Mambo?</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: Sure. Everybody does the Mambo!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Don’t tell me you’ve never heard of rock’n
roll…</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: Rock and what?</p>
<p><strong>professor emmett brown</strong>: I’ve never heard of it
either.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Well maybe it’s time you did!</p>
