<p><strong>ext. mount holliston - day 1</strong>: Peace.</p>
<p><strong>2 ext. the chair lift - day 2</strong>: Tight on a gloved
hand as a lever is released.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: I don’t see her.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: The shift change is late. Just wait.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Are you sure about this?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: We’ve been doing this forever. Trust me. This
lady loves Lynch. She always goes for it.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: I’m cute.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Is um… is that her?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Dude.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: It’s cool, it’s cool. Look, all you have to do
is smile real pretty and tell him-</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: -What? Me? No way. This is your thing.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: -GIRLfriends. Say “girlfriends”.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: -you and your girlfriends forgot your credit
card and you can’t pick up your lift tickets.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Dan, no. You do it. I feel stupid.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: You’ve got this. You can totally do this.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Parker, you’ve so got this.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: The worst thing that happens is he says no. He
won’t say no. No one ever says no.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Why me?</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: `Cause you’re a girl.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: A very beautiful girl with a very charming
smile.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: My charming smile?</p>
<p><strong>4 ext. chair lift line - continuous 4</strong>: Parker pushes
her snowboard forward and moves up the side of the line, passing all of
the skiers who are waiting.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Jason.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Oh, cool. My brother’s name is Jason.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Yeah, so I don’t want to waste your time and
bullshit you cause you seem like a wicked busy guy and
everything…but..this is gonna sound so stupid…</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: No- but I mean, we totally have some cash
and stuff. We just don’t have enough to cover all 3 lift tickets, you
know?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Like…fifty?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I could lose my job.</p>
<p><strong>5 ext. snow bank overlooking the chair lift - continuous
5</strong>: Lynch and Dan watch Parker at work.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: He’s not going for it.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Will you shut up? He’s gonna go for it. It’s
either stand there and do the job for minimal… minimal, what is it?</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Minimum.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: -Minimum wage or do it for minimum wage plus a
little bit more.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: She had to come skiing with us?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: You said you didn’t mind?</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: I don’t. I don’t mind. Don’t mind at all.</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: A beat.</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: us since last semester. You never come around for
Monday night football, nobody has seen you at-</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: -I watched the game with you last week!</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: For ten minutes, Dan. Football games are more
than ten minutes.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: They’re lots of ten minutes-es, you know?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Dude, I have a girlfriend now. I love this
girl. I don’t know what you…</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: No, no it’s fine. I’m just saying, the Mount
Holliston day trips were our thing, you know? She doesn’t even know how
to board yet.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: She’s getting better. Now I feel like a dick.
You should have said something if it was a problem.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: It’s not a problem. It’s not. Forget I ever
said anything.</p>
<p><strong>6 ext. chair lift line - continuous 6</strong>: Lynch and Dan
join Parker and slowly work their way up the line.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Good work! See? They always go for it.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: I did good, right?</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: You did great.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Oh, so where’s my change?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: There isn’t any.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: You gave him the full hundred?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: He wasn’t going for it at 50.</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: So what happened to the other fifty numbers in
between there? Like, I don’t know, $51 or maybe even $75?</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: You gave me two 50’s. What was I supposed to do,
ask for change?</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: I would have asked for change.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: It’s still way cheaper than paying for
tickets, right?</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: I would have definitely asked him for
change.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: “Girlfriends”?</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: Parker gives him an apologetic smile.</p>
<p><strong>7 ext. chair lift - moments later 7</strong>: The threesome
float high above the mountain as the chair slowly makes it’s way to the
top.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Look at that. See? All these other idiots are
paying top dollar to ski. Not us. All thanks to you, baby.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Oh, now I’m “baby”? You never call me pet
names.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I’m just not a `pet name’ guy.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: He calls me “Parker.”</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: It’s your name.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Yeah but you’re supposed to call me
something affectionate, you know? Like “honey” or “sweetie”.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: I hooked up with a girl last semester that
called me by my last name in bed. It was so weird. “Oh, Lynch! Your hair
is so soft! Do me harder, Lynch!” It was like I was throwing it to Dan
over here.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: See? At least I don’t call you “O’Neil”.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: You don’t touch my face enough either.</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: Dan laughs.</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: Third wheel.</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: Watch it, Lynch.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Hey, that’s not fair. I’m not dating you, you
don’t get to make my life suck.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Parker shoots Dan a look: “Oh, really?”</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Wha-? I never said that. I never said you make
my life suck. Sweetie.</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: After a beat he awkwardly reaches out and touches
her face. Nothing sweet or sensitive about it, but he’s trying.</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: Aww!</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Dan tells me you’re getting the hang of that
board?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: I wouldn’t say that. But last time we went I
did pretty good, right?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: You did awesome. I’m telling you, the first few
times are frustrating but once you get the hang of it, it’s like riding
a bike.</p>
<p>****: 10.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Please. Snowboards are too EMO for me. Give
it ten more years and that fad will be dead.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: That’s what they said about rap.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Mmm-mmm. Smell that fresh mountain air, huh?
Kind of smells like… cancer.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: You know what, I am so sick of potheads
giving me shit about smoking butts.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: At least pot does something for you.
Cigarettes are just gross. Especially out in the cold. It like sticks to
you and then you smell like a mixture of ash tray and an old man’s used
floss.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Used floss? Where do you come up with this
shit.</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: Have you ever sniffed your floss? It’s nasty.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: No, I have never- why would I ever sniff my
floss? Why am I friends with you?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: What time do you think we’ll get back? I
have about 2 weeks worth of chapters to read tonight.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Oh no. She broke the rule.</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: Parker you just broke the first rule.</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: No worrying about the bullshit of real life.
The whole point of this</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: is to relax and have fun. Worry about school when
you get home.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: But, I haven’t read a-</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: The chair suddenly stops and lurches forward
slightly. The sound of the chair lift cuts out.</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: Random SKIERS and BOARDERS in the surrounding
chairs express their disgust for the delay.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: It’s alright.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Uh-oh! Is someone afraid of heights?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: So it doesn’t bother you when I do this?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Quit it!</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: don’t like them.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Baby, in the whole history of time, only one
chair has ever fallen off</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: of a lift.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Points for calling me “baby” but you just
made that statistic up.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Yeah, statistics don’t work on smokers.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Oh, shut-up.</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: Laughter echoes from the chairs behind him.</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: LYNCH</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Actually, I paid good money.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Yeah, but I’m gonna pay you back so it’s like
the same thing.</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: He playfully sticks his tongue out at her and she
laughs as their chair moves forward exiting frame.</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: The three begin to get situated with their boards
and skis.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Why do I have to wear a helmet?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Safety first.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: But you guys don’t wear them.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: She looks around.</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: Cause they’re still learning, too. Come on, I’m
not gonna argue about this.</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: Even extreme boarders wear helmets. Nobody makes
fun of them.</p>
<p><strong>dan / lynch</strong>: Awww.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: You’re just doing this to make fun of
me.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: No, I’m not. I swear. You look hot in a
helmet.</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: Lynch nonchalantly maneuvers over to her
side.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Need some help?</p>
<p><strong>shannon</strong>: Do you think?</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: directly into his face.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: fastening the strap with his other.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Aww, check out Lynch.</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: See? Chick magnet.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: What the hell?</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Woah! Shit, man! I was just trying to
help!</p>
<p><strong>shannon</strong>: Ryan, what the hell?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: He had his hands all over you!</p>
<p><strong>shannon</strong>: No he didn’t. I can take care of
myself!</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: Dan and Shannon help Lynch to his feet.</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: be such an asshole sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: I was seriously just trying to help. I mean,
how could I even</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: compete with a catch like that?</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Are you OK?</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Yeah, I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>shannon</strong>: Well, thank you for your help. I am so, so
sorry about that.</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: I’m Shannon, by the way.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Joe.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Shan!</p>
<p><strong>shannon</strong>: Well it was nice to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: I was like one second away from beating that
guy’s ass.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I know you were, man. Come on. Don’t sweat
it.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Seriously, that guy was such a dick.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Come on boys. We can talk about how tough
you both are at the bottom.</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: Lynch starts down the hill.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I’m tough.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: I know you are.</p>
<p><strong>9 ext. ski trail - later 9</strong>: Dan, Parker, and Lynch
move down the mountain on their snow boards and skis.</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: Finally, Parker comes to a stop on her own next
to Dan and he claps for her.</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: Look at you! See? Having fun?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Are you kidding? We are totally doing this
every weekend. In fact, if they were open during the week I’d say we
should cut class, too.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Last one to the bottom is buying dinner!</p>
<p><strong>10 int. ski lodge - early evening 10</strong>: Parker gets
herself some hot chocolate in the distance while</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: Dan and Lynch pick at what’s left of a pizza on
the table in front of them.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: We gotta take a weekend trip up</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: North one of these days. Hit up Killington or
Okemo and really do it up right.</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: Why don’t we just do it over Christmas. You and
me.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Done. When I stayed with my cousin out West two
years ago it was like</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: the stuff you see in commercials. We had to take
like 3 lifts to get to the top and it was powder as far as you could
see.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Well, speaking of good skiing… it’s been cool
doing the bunny hill</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: all day but do you think we could get one real
run in before we leave tonight?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Dude, you didn’t have to stay with us. It’s
totally cool if you want to go off for a few.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: No, it’s fine. I’m just saying let’s step it
up a notch at some point. It’s been cool watching Parker fall on her ass
all day but I would like to actually ski at some point.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: You know, I’ve probably had enough for today
anyway. I can just stay in the lodge if you guys want to go-</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: Now Lynch feels horrible.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: -no, no, no that’s not what I meant. I didn’t
mean it like that.</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: Parker looks to Dan.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: I told you I didn’t have to come.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Parker, I didn’t not want you to come.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: It was his idea that we invited you in the
first place.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Exactly. Remember? I was like “Hey man, why
doesn’t Parker come</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: with us?” And you were like-</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: -I was like, “OK that would be cool”.</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: Parker isn’t buying it. She puts on a smile.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: It’s OK, you guys. The last thing a girl
wants to do is intrude on “guy time”. I won’t be offended. I’ve got
stuff I could do anyway. Actually, can I have the key? I should check my
messages.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: No. No locker key. I can tell you right now
that every message on there is going to be from your Mom giving you more
aggravation about whatever the hell.</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: Parker laughs.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: She does not.</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: Dan looks to Lynch.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Ready for this? Two nights ago we were watching
a movie and her Mom</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: kept calling and calling. And what did she
want?</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: DAN</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: What did you say? You said chicken.</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: Hell yes, I said chicken, but that’s not the
point. The point is you can go a few more hours without hearing from
Annette.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: I’m sorry if I ruined skiing for you
today.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: You didn’t! You didn’t at all! You missed the
part before you walked over here when I was all like, “Dude, this has
been so cool…you know…doing…”</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: Parker and Dan are beaming at him. He knows he’s
beat.</p>
<p><strong>11 ext. front of lodge - moments later, night 11</strong>:
Parker, Dan, and Lynch come out of the lodge.</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: From their POV the chair lift is still moving but
the line is empty.</p>
<p><strong>shannon</strong>: Joe!</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Wait up.</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: the lift line.</p>
<p><strong>shannon</strong>: Hey. I just wanted to apologize again.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Oh, no big deal. He’s just lucky he didn’t
make me mad. You know, I just look half your boyfriend’s size.</p>
<p><strong>shannon</strong>: Ex. He’s my ex-boyfriend. We’re, you know,
trying to still be friends and everything but as you can see, that’s not
really gonna work.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: No way.</p>
<p><strong>shannon</strong>: A group of us all agreed to go skiing this
weekend and well, whatever. It’s a whole story and-</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: SHANNON</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: Are you gonna be here next weekend?</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Where, here? Yeah, probably, yes.</p>
<p><strong>shannon</strong>: Cool. Well, my roommate and I come like
every Sunday, so maybe I’ll see you.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: That would be…a nice time.</p>
<p><strong>shannon</strong>: OK. See ya later.</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: and jogs after Shannon again.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Actually, you know what? Would it be cool if
I got your number or</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: something? That way I’ll…know how to catch up
with you and stuff.</p>
<p><strong>shannon</strong>: Yeah, sure.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Shit. Don’t ski with my phone. It’s in the
locker with everyone else’s stuff. Do you have a pen?</p>
<p><strong>shannon</strong>: Don’t ski with a pen. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Just shoot then. I’ve got a really good
memory. I’ve only smoked pot like 500 times so I’m good.</p>
<p><strong>shannon</strong>: You know it’s a gateway drug right?</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: SHANNON</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Whew. You! That’s so like you!</p>
<p><strong>12 ext. chair lift line - moments later 12</strong>: Dan and
Parker are in a heated debate with Jason the chair lift operator.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: He puts a red flag on the back of a chair that
heads up the mountain.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: But we gave you a hundred bucks and we’ve only
gotten like 4 runs!</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: It’s not my decision, man. They’re closing
early.</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: You’re only open three days a week. You can’t
afford to close early.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Why don’t you write a letter?</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Remember “429”.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Just remember “429”. “5022”. “5022.”
“5022.”</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: Come on, just one more run.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Honestly, I’d slide you some more money but we
gave you everything we have.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Hey man, do you have a pen?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: It’s not about the money. They need to clear
the mountain. We’ve got weather coming in. There’s nothing I can do.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: What if we promise to run straight</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: down. Like the quickest run ever.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Wicked fast.</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: Jason struggles. He sighs and looks around. There
are still plenty of skiers coming down.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Fine. But hurry.</p>
<p><strong>dan parker</strong>: Thank you! Thank you so much!</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: We’ll be wicked fast. Like the wind!</p>
<p><strong>13 ext. chair lift - moments later 13</strong>: Parker, Dan,
and Lynch slowly move up the mountain yet again.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Seriously. For a hundred bucks</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: you’d think he could cut us some slack.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I know right? They’re supposed to</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: stay open until 10 on Sundays. Whatever happened
to night skiing?</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Wachusett still has night skiing.</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: We should have gone there. It’s kinda like Ward
Hill but not as lame. Hey, you remember the numbers I told you?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: “429”.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Good for you, Lynch. You got her number!</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: What did He-Man have to say about that?</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: That guy? Who cares? Steroids shrink your dick.
Wait, shit. What were my four numbers? “5022”. Parker, will you remember
“5022”?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>14 ext. chair lift line - continuous 14</strong>: Jason
reaches for his cigarettes. He’s all out.</p>
<p><strong>rifkin</strong>: Early night, huh?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: You’re not gonna hear me complain.</p>
<p><strong>rifkin</strong>: Pendergraft wants you to stop by the office.
Something about next weekend’s schedule.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I’m not working next weekend.</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: JASON</p>
<p><strong>rifkin</strong>: Go talk to the boss. He’s getting ready to
leave.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I’m the best man! Shit.</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: Rifkin takes his place.</p>
<p><strong>rifkin</strong>: Ready to shut down?</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: As Jason runs away he turns back.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: There’s three more on their way down. Wait
for them, then it’s all set.</p>
<p><strong>15 ext. chair lift - continuous 15</strong>: The three
continue to talk.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: I’m not waiting til we get back to campus to
eat. I’m starving.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Why didn’t you have some pizza?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: You mean the cardboard with tomato sauce
that you guys ate? That wasn’t pizza. That was like,</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: `roller skating rink birthday party pizza’.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: There’s a Papa Gino’s on our way</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: back. It’s like 15 minutes down the road from the
mountain.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Sweet. I am gonna eat a whole real</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: pizza myself.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Check it out!</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: They look down to see THREE SKIERS hit a huge
jump, one after the other.</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: Last run. Gotta make it count.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: It’s just wind, Parker.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Don’t you mean, “baby”?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Who invited you?</p>
<p><strong>16 ext. chair lift line - moments later 16</strong>: Rifkin
warms his hands with his breath. The temperature is dropping fast.</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: HEYMAN runs by him on his way to the lodge.</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: Heyman! HEY, HEYMAN! Do me a solid?</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: RIFKIN</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: saying to him. He keeps running.</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: A low, distant thunder roll echoes far away.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Shit. Do you hear that?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: It’s the mountains. It snows every night.
Relax.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Seriously. I’m gonna eat a whole pizza. I’m
not even kidding.</p>
<p><strong>18 ext. chair lift line - moments later 18</strong>: Rifkin
kicks his feet around. He spies Jason’s discarded cigarette box on the
top of the trash and he inspects it for any left over cigarettes.</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: minutes earlier come flying down the mountain and
past him.</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: Last chair is through.</p>
<p><strong>rifkin</strong>: Cool. Last three just hit. I’m</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: clear.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Clear up here.</p>
<p><strong>19 ext. chair lift - continuous 19</strong>: The chair
lurches to a stop. Once again, the comforting</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: white noise of the motorized cables goes away,
leaving them in silence.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Oh, come on.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Bur!</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: It’s gonna start again, right?</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: Yes. Anyone got any jokes?</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: What did the fourteen year old girl from New
Hampshire say to her father when she lost her virginity?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: “Get off me, you’re crushing my</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Marlboros”.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: I told you that?</p>
<p><strong>20 ext. mount holliston - moments later 20</strong>: From
this distance the mountain looks like a giant night-</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: light of converging white strings.</p>
<p><strong>21 ext. chair lift - continuous 21</strong>: The three sit in
the freezing chair. Lynch is really getting impatient.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: What do you think the worst way to die would
be?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: That’s not morbid.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Yeah, seriously. That’s kinda spooky,
Dan.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I think getting eaten by a shark would be the
worst way to go. Not if it was like one of those</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: surfers where they get hit from behind and they
don’t even know what happened. You know. Cause it like came up</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: from beneath them. Like on the Jaws poster.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: The chick on the Jaws poster was</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: hot.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: She was?</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: I don’t know. She was naked. Naked chicks are
hot.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: But if you actually like saw the fin coming for
you in the water. That would be worse than actually</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: getting eaten. Knowing that this animal is coming
for you but you can’t get away. And that it’s going to eat you. Like
you’re gonna get eaten alive? Have you guys ever seen that footage of
the great white jumping out of the water to eat that seal?</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: That’s why I only swim in pools.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: I think burning to death would be the
worst.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Well yes and no. Because most people die of
the smoke inhalation before any fire even hits them.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: I remember watching TV for like 3</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: days straight after 9/11. That footage that they
kept showing of all of those people leaping off of the top of the Trade
Center? Can you imagine how bad it was inside</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: to know that jumping was a better way out?</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: But they say that when you jump</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: from that high up your heart stops before you hit
the ground and you don’t even feel it.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: OK, then Lynch. What is the worst</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: way to die?</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: No, you have an answer for</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: everything. What’s your biggest fear?</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Easy. The Sarlaac pit.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: The what?</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: The Sarlaac pit. From Return of the Jedi?
Hel-lo…being slowly digested over 1,000 years? Worst. Death. Ever.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: “I don’t know why I never have a girlfriend,
you guys!”</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Shut-up.</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: Why hasn’t it started again?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Give it a minute.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: This is nothing man. At Stowe last year, me
and Solet were stranded for like 25 minutes. This big chick fell getting
off up top and</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: twisted her leg. It was like- “move her to the
side and keep the line going people”. But no. They had to stop and
celebrate it right there and we all had to-</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: BOOM. The lights go out.</p>
<p><strong>a21 ext. mount holliston - continuous a21</strong>: Across
the mountain all of the trail lights go out, one by one.</p>
<p><strong>b21 ext. chair lift - continuous b21</strong>: They sit in
darkness.</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: At first no one can speak.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Come on now! This is messed up.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Are they fucking kidding?</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: I kind of just shat in my pants a bit, I’m
not gonna lie.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: No one knows we’re up here. They forgot that
we’re up here.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: No they didn’t. They couldn’t have. I’m sure
they have a system or something. There’s probably security cameras on us
right now.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: He starts waving around his hands.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: What if they don’t start it again?</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: What if everyone went home?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Will you stop?!</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: They didn’t go home. Stop freaking me out. Remind
me to knock down that fucking lift operator when we get down. This is
horse shit.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: What did you say to the guy?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Me? Nothing!</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Well, clearly you pissed him off enough to do
this.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I didn’t do anything! He knows we’re still up
here.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Then why are the lights off, Dan? Is that
part of their policy? Shut</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: off the lights and scare the customers?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: They just lost power or something.</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: I’m sure it’s gonna come back on any second. They
didn’t go home. That’s retarded.</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: After a few more moments.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: This is so messed up.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: It’s a power outage. They’ll come up with a
ladder if they have to.</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: We need to get down from here. We can’t just sit
up here. Why isn’t the goddamn chair moving, Dan? What the hell?!</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Well you being all psycho about it isn’t gonna
make it move. Just chill out.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Don’t yell at me.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I wasn’t yelling at you but you need to relax.
This stuff happens all the time. Can you imagine the law suit if they
left everyone on this lift up here all night?</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Free lift tickets.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: What other people on the lift? There was no
one in front of us.</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: She made a good point. But still…</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: We won’t be stuck here all night.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: No. You’re right. We won’t be here all
night. It’s Sunday. Its fucking Sunday and they aren’t</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: open again until Friday. We’ll be stuck here all
week.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: PARKER</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: We’re not going to be stuck here. Parker.
Parker, look at me. Even</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: if by some strange reason they really did forget
us up here- we can jump. I see people jump off of chair lifts all the
time.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: It’s true. I’ve done it before. You just get
tired of waiting, you wait for a spot with some serious powder and you
just jump. It’s actually kind of fun, but they can ban you from the
mountain for it.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Shh. I know you’re scared. I’m scared, too. But
any minute now they’re gonna turn the power back on and we’re all gonna
be laughing about this.</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: More moments pass in silence as they survey their
situation.</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: I have to pee.</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: I have to pee wicked bad.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: That makes two of us.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Ew, Lynch if you pull out your junk in front of
me I’m gonna puke.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Well, what do you want me to do? I gotta
go.</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: How am I supposed to go?</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: Well if we just lift the bar up you could
probably just bend over if we hold on to you.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Are you crazy! Put the bar down!!!</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: It’s just the safety bar. It doesn’t really
do anything anyway.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Well I like the safety bar and I like it
down where it’s supposed to be.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Then how are you going to piss?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: I can hold it.</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: For a whole week?</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: Sorry. She’s the one who said we’d be here for “a
week”!</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: Parker takes a deep breath.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: I can hold it.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: I’m telling you, five minutes from now we’ll all
be laughing.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: I’m pissing.</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: them.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I hope they catch you and throw you out. I hope
they ban you from the</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: mountain. That’s so nasty.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Ban me from the mountain? You couldn’t pay me
to come back here. Make me sit up here in below zero weather forever
while they get their damn Fisher Price lift working? Sorry. Not coming
back.</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: Almost instantly, giant balls of hail stream down
at them. “Ping-ing” off of the metal chair and pelting their faces.</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: Parker sobs quietly into Dan’s shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Put the safety bar down, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Put the bar down.</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: Lynch pulls the bar down and sulks, looking away
from Dan.</p>
<p><strong>22 ext. mount holliston - moments later 22</strong>: The
sleet begins to ice over the leaves and vegetation below.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: 39.</p>
<p><strong>23 ext. mount holliston - moments later, wider 23</strong>:
The entire mountain is covered in dark clouds.</p>
<p><strong>24 ext. chair lift - moments later 24</strong>: The three
stranded kids huddle together for warmth as the hail pours down around
them in sheets.</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: Suddenly, a beam of light begins to shine up at
them.</p>
<p><strong>25 ext. mount holliston - continuous 25</strong>: A Snow Cat
slowly makes it’s way down the hill towards the</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: bottom. It’s headlights shine across the trees in
front of it.</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: Dan begins to cheer.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: What did I tell you guys, huh? WOO-</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Oh, thank God.</p>
<p><strong>27 ext. mount holliston - continuous 27</strong>: The Snow
Cat is now really close. It is literally coming right for them.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: 40.</p>
<p><strong>28 ext. chair lift - continuous 28</strong>: Dan and Parker
wave their hands in the rain.</p>
<p><strong>29 ext. below the chair - continuous 29</strong>: The Snow
Cat continues on right underneath them. It doesn’t</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: look like it’s going to stop.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Panic sets in yet again.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Why isn’t he stopping?</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: STEVE concentrates on the path. The roar of his
engine is almost deafening.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Steve.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Go for Steve.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: We got a problem here.</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: Below them, the Snow Cat slows down to a
halt.</p>
<p><strong>33 int. snow cat - continuous 33</strong>: Steve listens.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: It’s nothing but ice at the bottom of Wildcat so
you’re gonna have to cut over to the south hill and come around the
side.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: That’s gonna take me 20 minutes!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Sorry brother, but it’s a frozen swimming
pool down here.</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: 10-4.</p>
<p><strong>34 ext. chair lift - continuous 34</strong>: Below them, they
see the Snow Cat start to back up and turn to the right.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: What is this asshole doing?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: No! No!</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: inches.</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: Parker takes off her helmet and throws it
down.</p>
<p><strong>35 int. snow cat - continuous 35</strong>: Steve turns the
headlights in the opposite direction, just missing the helmet falling
past his windshield.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Though we can briefly see the light shine off of
the three kids, unless you knew they were there or were looking for
them…you would have missed them, too.</p>
<p><strong>36 ext. chair lift - continuous 36</strong>: The Snow Cat
drives away.</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: Lynch throws one of his ski poles but doesn’t
even come close.</p>
<p><strong>37 ext. mount holliston - later 37</strong>: It has stopped
hailing.</p>
<p><strong>38 ext. chair lift - continuous 38</strong>: The three shiver
uncontrollably.</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: Finally.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: My face is burning.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: The power is coming back on soon.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: No it isn’t.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: It has to.</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: don’t wear a watch.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Me neither. I use my phone. Hold on, let me
just run back to the</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: locker real quick and I’ll find out.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Stop.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Crunch Berries…</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Please, stop.</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: Apple Jacks…</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Dude, quit it.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: …and I’m gonna go out on a limb and say Lucky
Charms pre-purple horseshoes.</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: Silence.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Silence.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Everyone went home. They left us up
here.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Top 3 celebrities you’d do. Me first again?
Fine…</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Someone has to jump.</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: His voice is getting hoarse.</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: I don’t want to die up here.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: You’re not gonna die, baby. I</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: won’t let you die. OK? I promise I won’t let you
die.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: I’m so scared.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: It’s alright. It’s alright.</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: DAN</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Great. Best Christmas present you ever got?
Go.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Shayna. My puppy.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Disneyworld in 8th grade.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Hmm…guess that leaves me. I’m gonna go
with…oh yeah…these skis! Get it? MY SKIS. How ironic, huh?</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: Parker takes off her glove to light a
cigarette.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: See? That’s where smoking gets you.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Shut-up.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: She keeps struggling with the lighter but
eventually gives up. She throws the cigarette away and puts her exposed
hand back in her pocket.</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: PARKER</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I’m jumping. I’m gonna get help.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Dan…woah. Let’s talk about this.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: No. No, don’t leave me up here.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Parker, I can do this. Even if I get hurt, as
long as I can get to the bottom I….your skin is so red. You’re getting
frost bite.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: You can’t get frost bite that fast. It’s only
been- what, like…how long has it been? A few hours, tops?</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: but the tip of her nose and her right cheek is
discoloring.</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: Don’t leave me.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I’ll get help. Lynch is here. He’ll be with
you.</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: Lynch is looking down below them. It’s far.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Dan, it’s a far drop. I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Do you have a better idea? I’m telling you,
I’ve totally jumped off of a lift before.</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: If we can wait `til morning I bet someone will
come up here. Like a snow groomer or some shit.</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: Really? And why would they come groom the snow on
a day when they aren’t open, Joe? A day when they still have a full work
week before they open again?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: No, no, no. Please don’t jump down there,
Dan. You’ll get hurt.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: How are you going to find your way in the
dark?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I’ll stick to the trail. I’ll ride to the
bottom.</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: You don’t get a fresher run than this, right?</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: It lands sticking up straight in the snow.</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: Parker and Lynch look back at him. They don’t
know what to say.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Walker, no.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: One.</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: Parker’s tears are freezing on her cheeks as the
seconds tick by.</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: Lynch takes a deep breath. When enough time has
elapsed to think Dan’s gonna jump, he suddenly looks up at Lynch instead
of jumping.</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: You’re gonna be OK, baby.</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: we drop from the chair all the way to the frozen
ground below.</p>
<p><strong>39 ext. below the chair - continuous 39</strong>: CRACK! Both
of Dan’s legs shatter from the impact. Viscera protrudes out of his snow
pants as his leg bones shoot out the top of his knees.</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: Parker calls down to him.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: DAN! DANNY? Oh my god!</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: Dan’s cries turn to quiet breaths below them. It
is tough for Parker and Lynch to make out what exactly is happening.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Dan, say something. Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: My legs. I broke my fucking legs.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Oh, shit.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Can you move? Dan? Hold on. Hold on,
baby.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: I gotta…I have to get to him.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: You’ll just get hurt, too. Stop. Calm
down.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Calm down?! Talk to me, Danny!</p>
<p><strong>41 ext. below the chair - continuous 41</strong>: Dan
struggles.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Stay there. Don’t get off the</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: chair.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: How bad is it?</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: Dan can see that his legs are shattered and that
he is bleeding. Bone protrudes from his bloody ski pants.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: It’s bad. It’s really fucking bad.</p>
<p><strong>42 ext. mount holliston - continuous 42</strong>: Dan’s
screams can barely be heard from this distance. The blanket of snow
muffles all sounds of life on the mountain.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: 51.</p>
<p><strong>43 ext. chair lift - continuous 43</strong>: Parker sobs into
Lynch’s shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: OK. Alright. You gotta stay</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: strong for me, Parker. Can you do that?</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: LYNCH</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: What are we gonna do? We’re gonna die up
here.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Buddy, can you move at all?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I can’t even stand up.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: You can’t, like…I don’t know, slide down the
hill or something?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: My legs are shattered, asshole! I’m bleeding to
death- NO, I CAN’T</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Alright, alright. Um…?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: …so much blood.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Can you stop the bleeding?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: With what?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Here…</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: She takes off her scarf and tosses it below.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: PARKER</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Here you go, Dan. I’m throwing mine down.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I can’t see.</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: Just feel for it, OK? Here it comes…</p>
<p><strong>48 ext. below the chair - continuous 48</strong>: The scarf
lands right next to Dan.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: What do I do with this?</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Tie it over your leg. Tie it off above
wherever it’s bleeding. Like a tourniquet thing.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I’m so cold.</p>
<p><strong>49 ext. chair lift - continuous 49</strong>: Parker starts to
take off her coat.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Here, take my coat.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: No! Don’t you take off your coat!</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: You need it!</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: No, I’ll be OK. I can huddle next to Lynch.
Please-</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: -Parker, keep your coat on.</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: Dan takes off his snowboarding gloves and ties
the elastic strings together. His fingers are so numb that it takes
several tries.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Dan, buddy. You gotta let us throw something
down so you can stop the bleeding.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I…I’ve got it.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Are you sure.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Yup.</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: Moments pass with only their breathing.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Are you sure you can’t try and get</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: down the hill, buddy?</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: No, man. I can’t move. I can’t move.</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: Lynch holds his head.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Alright. Hold on.</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: Once again, Lynch starts looking all around.
Above, below.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: You think you can pull yourself across that
many chairs?</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: I can’t even do a pull-up.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: You never even tried to do a pull up you
asshole. You had your Mom write you a note to get out of climbing the
rope in gym cause you’re a pussy.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: There was no reason to embarrass myself. I
knew I couldn’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: You can too. Remember Jenny Bluth? She fucking
did it. You can do it.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Even if I made it across to the</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: next chair…how many more would it take before I
found one closer to the ground?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Every lift pole has an emergency</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: ladder on it.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: OK. The chair that’s two back. Does it look
like it’s near the pole?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: I don’t know. I can’t see.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Shit, that’s far.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: What if you fall, too?</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Parker…if we just sit here, we’re gonna
freeze to death.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Maybe…maybe in the morning someone else will
come up here.</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: Maybe, they’ll need to do maintenance on the lift
or something, you know?</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: What’s going on up there? You guys?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: We’re right here, baby.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Yeah, man. We didn’t go anywhere. I think…I
think I’m gonna try and climb back to the pole. If the chair is close
enough, maybe…</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: maybe I can jump to it.</p>
<p><strong>52 ext. below the chair - continuous 52</strong>: Dan is in
agony.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Do it. Please do it now.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Just hang in there, Dan. It’s gonna be
OK.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: It’s funny. But I was never afraid of
heights, until like…right now.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: What can I do to help?</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Just hold on to my legs. You can’t really
stop me from falling…but it’s, you know…psychological or something you
know?</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: Parker maneuvers herself to hold Joe’s legs..</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: LYNCH</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: I think we should wait til morning. We can
make it a few more hours.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Us? Maybe. But not him.</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: As Lynch gets ready to try and stand again…we
hear something in the surrounds.</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: Again, a sort of “moan” rings in the
distance.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Baby, is that you?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Shh!</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: 58.</p>
<p><strong>54 ext. below the chair - continuous 54</strong>: This time,
clear as day…a WOLF HOWL.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Oh, motherfucker.</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: Lynch tries to control the panic.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: It’s alright man. It’s just a</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: coyote or something. They’re scared of people. It
probably won’t even come anywhere near us,</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: That sounded like a fucking wolf.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Just relax. When’s the last time you heard of
a wolf attack in New England?</p>
<p><strong>56 ext. below the chair - continuous 56</strong>: Even in the
pale moonlight, it is easy to see how white Dan</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: is becoming.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I read about one on-line somewhere last year.
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Wolves around here are pussies. They aren’t
even that big.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: It could be worse, right?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: How the hell…could this be worse?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: It could be the Sarlacc Pit.</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: laugh. It’s uncomfortable and forced as hell. But
it’s a laugh.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Parker- coming through with the</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: tension breaker, look out! She’s alright, Walker.
Your girl is alright.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: LYNCH</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: LYNCH</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: What can I do?</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Nothing. Just be quiet.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: You can do this, Lynch. You’ve got it.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Please stop talking.</p>
<p><strong>58 ext. below the chair - continuous 58</strong>: Shards of
ice fall down around Dan. He covers his head for</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: protection.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Hold on, down there. I think once I can stand
on the back- I should</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: be able to reach the top.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Dan takes his gloves away from his face…only to
freeze in horror.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: You guys.</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: DAN</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: What? What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: There’s a wolf down here.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Oh shit!</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: Dan doesn’t take his eyes off of the wolf. He is
shaking in fear.</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: What the hell do I do?</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: THWOCK! Parker’s snowboard comes down and skids
away into the trees, pushing the wolf further back.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: 62.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Are you alright man?</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: Yeah. I’m alive.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: See? What did I tell you? They’re more scared
of you than you are of them.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I don’t know. I’m pretty scared, I gotta be
honest.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: It’s just a dog. That’s all it is.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: He won’t be back.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Are you keeping warm down there?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: As warm as I can.</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: I can’t feel my legs anymore. Is that bad? I
mean, it doesn’t hurt as much…but that’s bad right?</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: No, no. You’ll be alright. That’s probably
really bad. I gotta move, so I need you to-</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: He motions wiping his face.</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: Ow! It feels like…like sunburn.</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: I’m not an expert but I think that’s frost
bite.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Look at me- is my face changing color
anywhere?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: I don’t..I can’t see anything. I</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: don’t know, it’s too dark</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: No! Stop touching it. Don’t touch it.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: But it itches now…</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: I know- but if you keep touching your face
it’s gonna rub off.</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: You gotta move faster up there.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: I’m trying man, I’m trying.</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: Lynch slowly lifts himself up onto the back of
the chair, which bends at an awkward angle.</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: slowly starts to maneuver his body up to the top
of the chair arm- the height looks `stomach droppingly’ scary.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Careful.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Stop talking.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Lynch. I think the-</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: Silence.</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: The distance to the next chair seems about 10
times as far now.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Don’t look down.</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: With one hand in front of the other, Lynch hoists
himself about two feet off of the chair and into the air.</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: Slippery.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Do you got it?</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Shh.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: The cable clangs somewhere to the front and back
of Lynch. The noise is almost refreshing in the silent ice covered
wilderness.</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: Another two feet out. He looks down for the first
time.</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: Oh god.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Please no. Please no…</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Come on, Lynch! You had it!</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: I got you.</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: PARKER</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: PARKER</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: her.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Don’t look down.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Don’t look down there, Parker.</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: them…we reveal Dan splayed out on the ground
below.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Lynch? What’s wro-</p>
<p><strong>64 ext. below the chair - continuous 64</strong>: Dan hears
the first growl.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Oh shit. Oh shit.</p>
<p><strong>65 ext. chair lift - continuous 65</strong>: Lynch doesn’t
look down. He just stares at Parker.</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: Lynch holds her head in a vice grip. He presses
his forehead into hers. Her tears and snot overflow onto his gloves.</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: Shhhh. Don’t listen to it. Don’t listen. Don’t
listen.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Don’t let her look!</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: Lynch continues to hold his hands over Parker’s
ears and keep her eyes pointed at his as the sounds of Dan’s demise echo
through the night.</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: bones popping from their joints creates a chorus
of pain below.</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: The camera never sees it. Only Lynch and Parker’s
faces.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Silence once again.</p>
<p><strong>66 ext. mount holliston - continuous 66</strong>: Parker’s
screams echo across the dark wilderness. Somewhere</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: in the distance, birds take off in fear.</p>
<p><strong>67 ext. chair lift - much later 67</strong>: Lynch and Parker
sit on the frozen chair, shivering.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: I should…try and…</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Why did you let him jump?</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: Lynch turns and looks at her in disbelief.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: You can’t be fucking serious.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: It was too far.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: He said he could do it. You didn’t</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: try and stop him! I can’t believe this?! You’re
blaming me?</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: I’m not…I’m not blaming you.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: You’re his girlfriend! I didn’t see you
throwing yourself in front of him!</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: He wasn’t going to listen to me.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Oh, but he would have listened to me? I said
it was a bad idea! I</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: said it was too far a drop! But I didn’t hear any
better ideas out of you except for crying about it! Don’t you fucking
blame me! You’ve been his girlfriend, for what? A year maybe? I’ve known
him my whole fucking life!</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: But you… You should have…</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: What? Say it.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: I didn’t say that.</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: But you want to! It’s OK. I get it. It should
have been me down there cause who gives a fuck about me, right?</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: Parker feels terrible. She puts her hand on his
shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: No, no, I-</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: Lynch shrugs her hand off of him.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: You know what? If we hadn’t spent the whole
fucking day on the bunny slope watching you fall on your ass</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: we would have gotten some real runs in and we
could have just gone home!</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: You’re sorry? Maybe if you hadn’t fucked with our
thing… maybe if you had just stayed home and not forced yourself into
every aspect of his life… maybe my best friend</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: wouldn’t be dead right now!</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: That’s not fair!</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: And it’s not fair that my best friend is
DEAD!</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: I’m sorry! I didn’t mean it! I’m just- I’m
just-</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: -Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: chest, letting it all out.</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: LYNCH</p>
<p><strong>a67 ext. below the chair - later a67</strong>: Snow has now
almost completely covered any of Dan’s remains that were left on the
scene. Only the tip of a boot and a piece of jacket are visible.</p>
<p><strong>b67 ext. chair lift - continuous b67</strong>: Parker and
Lynch are shivering together.</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: They only speak to be speaking.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: 429…</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: 5…5…shit, what was it? 5520? 5020?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: 5022.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: 5022. 429-5022. I’m so gonna call that girl
when we get home. And you know what? I’m gonna marry her. No messing
around. I’m just gonna be like “Hey Shannon, it’s me Joe from the chair
lift. Will you marry me?” And then we’re gonna get a house and have 2
kids and a dog named Steve.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Who’s gonna pay for the house.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: She will. Shannon’s got a great</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: job.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: What does she do.</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: Lynch makes something up…but continues to have no
expression in his words. Despite his talk, his spirit is shattered.</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: She…an orthodontist.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Orthodontists make a lot of money.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Yup.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: I bet you guys will be really happy.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: 429-5022.</p>
<p><strong>68 ext. below the chair - continuous 68</strong>: A wolf
settles in the bushes and looks up at the two “pieces</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: of food” on the chair high above.</p>
<p><strong>69 ext. chair lift - continuous 69</strong>: Silence.
Then…</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Who names their dog “Steve”.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: I will.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Steve’s a “people” name.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Says who?</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: You don’t like walk into someone’s house and have
them say “Here’s my dog Steve.”</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: Why not? Steve’s a good name for a dog.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: “Here, meet my cat Chris.”</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: No cats. Just a dog. Steve.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Shayna must be so hungry.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: What kind of pizza should we get at Papa
Gino’s?</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: Parker doesn’t hear him. As she continues, wet
snow starts to fall around them and the icy wind starts to pick up.</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: The poor thing. She’s just a puppy. She won’t
understand that I died. She’s gonna think I left her. That I forgot
about her. All she wants is for me to come home. She’s probably waiting
by the door for me right now. Every sound she hears in the hallway she’s
probably cocking her little head to the side, waiting to see if I’m
going to walk in. But I won’t. I won’t ever walk in. And Shayna’s going
to starve to death. The poor thing is gonna wither away and die waiting
by the door for me and it’s all my fault.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: She won’t starve to death and you’re not
going to die.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: No one else has a key to my place.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: The neighbors will break the door down if she
doesn’t stop barking. Someone will figure it out. She’ll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: And so will you. So will we.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: I would have had Shayna for a year this
month. I got her a year ago for Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: I know. But you’ll see her again.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Dan and I were spending Christmas with my
parents this year. We won’t be there though.</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: I want to see my Mom and my Dad. I want to open
presents in the morning and then wait for my grandmother to show up so
we can</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: eat. She’s always late. But she brings all of the
desserts. And she makes this special hot apple cider thing with cinnamon
and nutmeg. It’s so good. And after dinner my Dad always passes out on
the couch `cause it’s his one day off and he’s had too much eggnog. And
my sister, my Mom, and I watch A Christmas Story until the marathon is
over. And that’s how you know Christmas is really over. When Ralphie
gets his Red Rider carbine-action two-hundred-shot range model air rifle
that last time and they go back to their regular programming.</p>
<p>****: 75.</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: The camera pulls back wider and wider until their
chair is lost in the wet snowfall and darkness.</p>
<p><strong>70 ext. chair lift - the next morning 70</strong>: Dawn is
breaking over the trees.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: together, but neither is moving.</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: Lynch has the start of his own frost-bite on his
ears and nose.</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: Her eyes search around as the realization that
this was not all just a bad dream sinks in.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Uhh…</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: After what feels like an eternity, she gives her
hand one last jerk, freeing it from the safety bar.</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: Her movement startles Lynch awake, and he bolts
upright as if from a `falling nightmare’.</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: trying to get his bearings.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Lynch, bug-eyed, takes in the world around
him.</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: struggle.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: I…thought I was dreaming. This. I thought
this was a dream.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Your frost-bite. It’s getting…worse.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Really? How bad is it?</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Don’t. It’s bad.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: It’s not as itchy any more.</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: Just don’t touch your face, OK? When we get out
of here, we’ll get you to a doctor right away and they’ll fix it.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: You have some dark spots on your face,
too.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: They’ll fix me, too then. Just</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: don’t touch it.</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: Well, it’s morning. Maybe someone will come up
here now.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: I don’t know. Mountain maintenance. Besides,
when none of us show up for class people are going to start looking for
us.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: No one’s gonna look for me. I skip class all
the time. By the time anyone notices I’m gone I’ll be dead.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Can you please just think ONE positive thing?
Please!</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Besides. No one knows we’re here.</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: His voice echoes off of the frozen trees, almost
as if taunting him.</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: LYNCH</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: Parker doesn’t speak.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Are you sure you don’t just wanna give it a
few more hours? What if you’re right? What if someone is going to come
up here, even though they’re not open today?</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: one is coming” but he decides there’s no harm in
waiting just a little while longer.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: I just wish I could stand up. Get out of
this position for a minute.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: If you want, you can stand on the chair and I
can hold onto you.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: No. I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Well, if anything’s gonna get you over your
fear of heights, it’s this.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: No. I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Alright.</p>
<p><strong>71 ext. chair lift line - later 71</strong>: The bottom of
the mountain looks like it has been abandoned.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: An empty lodge.</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: Lynch is sleeping. His head is leaned to one side
in a position that is sure to give him the worst stiff neck he’s ever
had.</p>
<p><strong>73 ext. chair lift - later 73</strong>: They both sleep.</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: Finally, Lynch stirs and checks Parker to see if
she is still breathing.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Hey…hey Parker…</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Shit, I thought you stopped breathing…</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: He notices her skinned cheek. Her ear tips are
now completely blackened.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>74 ext. chair lift - later 74</strong>: From beneath the
chair we see shards of ice and snow fall</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: onto the ground.</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: Parker holds onto his legs tightly.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: It was all that pizza talk.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: I have no strength.</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: Then don’t do this.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Damn it.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Maybe later.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: What? Like I’m gonna feel better if I wait a
little longer? I should have done it last night while I still had some
strength.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: There’s more snow fall on the ground and
it’s all fresh. Maybe the jump won’t be as bad now.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Even if it was a foot deeper- it</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: wouldn’t break that fall. I should have just
climbed across last night. I had strength. I had adrenaline.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: What do you want me to do?</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Nothing. Let’s sit and do nothing.</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: She reaches into her pocket and removes her
cigarettes. The box is damp, but the cigarettes inside are still
dry.</p>
<p><strong>75 ext. below the chair - continuous 75</strong>: The pack of
cigarettes falls into the snow.</p>
<p><strong>76 ext. chair lift - late afternoon 76</strong>: The two are
bundled together as the evening winds start to pick up.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: How come you never have a girlfriend?</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: How am I supposed to answer that?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: I mean, you’re a decent guy. Girls dig you.
But you never stay in a relationship.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: I had a serious girlfriend once.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: High School doesn’t count.</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: No, post-high school. Freshmen year.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: This girl Annie. I met her at orientation. We
emailed all summer and when we started school, it was like we were
already going out. I</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: totally just felt it with her, you know? We were
into a lot of the same stuff, which was cool. She was way into
Aerosmith. I had seen them fifteen times, she had seen them twenty. How
cool is that?</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: She um… same favorite movie as me. E.T. It
was like soul mates</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: and that stuff you read about.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: So then… what happened?</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Same old shit. No. You know what happened?
She liked another guy. This fucking fraternity douchebag named Dean who
kept sending her flowers and stuff. I don’t know who it was exactly, but
every time I’d go to her room some guy named “Dean” had left her notes
and shit.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Why did she keep it? Was she trying to make
you jealous?</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: I don’t know. I think she just liked getting
attention.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: So she dumped you for a frat guy?</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: No. I dumped her. We were in the cafeteria,
right? And I was sitting facing her, facing the wall…and she was facing
everyone in the cafeteria behind me. And I</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: kept seeing her smiling at someone behind me and
like, almost laughing. So I was like, “who are you laughing at?” You
know? Like “what the hell is going on?” And she’s like, “Dean’s making
fun of</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: you.” So I turn around, and I’m like ready to
kick the shit out of this guy. And all I see is a sea of fucking random
people. Just all of these faces. This guy could see me and was making
eyes with my</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: girlfriend…but I couldn’t see him.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: That’s messed up.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: I’ve never felt so stupid and bad in my life.
So I left.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: You just walked out?</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Yup. Told her to go laugh with “Dean the Frat
guy”. I was out.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: That sucks.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Maybe… maybe I shouldn’t have been so quick
to walk out. Maybe I needed to have a thicker skin and not be such a
sensitive bitch, I don’t know. Sometimes I think I was just insecure and
maybe I</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: screwed up.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: You should call her. When you get home. You
could tell her that.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: I can’t. She’s dating Dean.</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: Emotion has fought it’s way to the surface again.
Parker and Lynch share a nervous laugh together.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: After a few seconds, her laughs turn to
tears.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: I should have done something.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: There was nothing either of us could have
done.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: I sat here and let him die.</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: No, you didn’t. We didn’t let him die. There was
nothing we could have done. He jumped down there to try and save us,
OK?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: He was the one. He was the boy I was gonna
marry.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Funny story. First grade, we all get left
there for the day by our mom’s. You know, alone in real school for the
first time without our folks around. And Dan… Dan was this sort of
chubby kid when he was little…</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: LYNCH</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: like a total pussy.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Sounds like Dan.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: You have no idea. But then, the teacher… Mrs…
What was her name? Mrs. Schifrin? She was trying everything to get the
fat kid to stop crying. And so she</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: says, “Well Dan, is there anyone else in the
class that you know?” You know, like, “Maybe there’s a friend you’d like
to sit with?” And the fucker points right at me and says “him”! I had
never seen this kid before in my life, you know? But for whatever
reason, he</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: points right at me.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: And so he had to sit with you?</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: For a week! For my whole first week of school
I’m sharing my little cubby desk with his fat ass!</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: I loved him so much.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: But if he died only for you and me to give up
and die up here, that’s bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: So I need you to pull it together, and we’re
gonna get out of this shit. We’re gonna get out of this</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: for Dan. Alright?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Yes.</p>

forward.</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: Lynch squeezes his eyes shut and takes another
reach forward.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Please God…please God….please God…</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Rrrugh!</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: You can do it. Please do it.</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: Arrrrr!</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: He reaches up and grabs hold again…his strength
is weaning.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Got it.</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: Another few quick reaches forward and he is more
than halfway across to the next chair.</p>

back and forth as he momentarily rests.</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: Parker looks down, just in time to see one of the
wolves duck back into the bushes.</p>

<p><strong>parker</strong>: You made it!</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Not yet. Halfway.</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: LYNCH</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Very weak.</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: She can’t quite hear him.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: I said THROW MY POLE AS FAR AS YOU CAN THIS
WAY. When I get on the ground I’ll need some defense.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Oh shit.</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: Hey. Halfway to me is better than up there with
you, right? Shit.</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: He starts to pull himself up again, but turns
back to Parker one more time.</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: LYNCH</p>

<p><strong>d</strong>: With reserved strength, Lynch shimmies across the
cable as quickly as he can.</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: is keeping her from plunging to the ground.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Please god, don’t let me fall. Don’t let me
fall.</p>
<p><strong>lynch</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: He assesses the situation.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: …</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: The two stare at each other from the distance.
Both of their weather beaten faces are a mess.</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: Stoically, Lynch turns away from her and takes a
deep breath.</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: Finally he reaches the ground and his body falls
with a THUD into the snow.</p>
