<p><strong>int. st. anne’s academy - akron, ohio - classroom</strong>:
We are in a parochial school classroom, in the late Sixties. The
children all wear uniforms and sit at little desks. SISTER IMMACULATA
stands at the front of the room; she is a middle-aged nun, very severe.
The children are all terrified of her.</p>
<p><strong>sister immaculata</strong>: Who can name all the Apostles?
Yes?</p>
<p><strong>sister immaculata</strong>: Christine?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Sister, may I be excused?</p>
<p><strong>sister immaculata</strong>: Christine…</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: It’s an emergency. Real bad.</p>
<p><strong>angle on a door marked broom closet</strong>: Christine opens
this door. She looks into the closet. There is a very nervous
thirteen-year-old BOY waiting for her inside.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Hi, Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>sister immaculata</strong>: Miss Christine Carter! Again!
Don’t you know what happens to girls like you? Don’t you know what they
become?</p>
<p><strong>christy’s voice</strong>: Come on, Vince – hold me a
minute.</p>
<p><strong>vince’s voice</strong>: I’d love to. babe – but I’ve got to
go. It was great. Like usual.</p>
<p><strong>christy’s voice</strong>: It was twenty minutes. Like
usual.</p>
<p><strong>vince’s voice</strong>: The best.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: You are something else.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Come on – stay. Just a little. We can talk,
I’ll get a pizza. Pizza in bed, we’ll have fun. And you still haven’t
told me what happened. What did she say?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: What did who say?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Who? The other woman. Your wife.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: You are so damn sexy.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Vince…</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: How did I get so lucky? What is it now, five
years we’ve been together? Who do I thank?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Today was the deadline, Vince.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: I want us to be together. Like people.
Honest, decent people. In the eyes of God. Babe, today… I went to
confession.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: You did what?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: For the first time in I don’t know how long.
I wanted everything done right. Open and above board. I told Father
Antonelli I was in love. I told him it was a special love, for all the
ages.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: You said that? And what did he say? Did he
say you could leave her? Did he say we’d be happy?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: He said that if I got a divorce I’d burn in
Hell. For all eternity.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: You want me to go against a priest? Get
excommunicated? You think I’m nuts?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: You bastard!</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: We can still see each other. Just like
always. It’s a different kind of sin. Smaller.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: You pig!</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Babe, it’s not me! I love you! It’s God!</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: You lying sleazeball! The best years of my
life! What am I, garbage? Am I lint?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: You’re upset. I understand. I should go. I
hate to.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Get out of here! And never come back!</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: I’ll call.</p>
<p><strong>elvis</strong>: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Are you
lonesome tonight? Welcome to the Moonlight Hotel and Casino’s incredible
Platinum Oldies Spectacular.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: But you can’t quit. What’ll happen to us?
Tell her she can’t quit.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: I told her. She stuck pantyhose in my
mouth.</p>
<p><strong>elvis</strong>: Please welcome our own girl group
extraordinaire, our beehives of beauty – the fabulous Ronelles!</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Oh, girls.</p>
<p><strong>ronelles</strong>: Yes, Betty?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: This prom is a real drag.</p>
<p><strong>ronelles</strong>: Oh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Oh my!</p>
<p><strong>ronelles</strong>: What is it, Betty?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Look at that. Get a gander.</p>
<p><strong>ronelles</strong>: Oh my!</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: He’s so dreamy. He’s like… a Greek god.
He’s the cutest guy here. He’s boss. He’s fab. He’s…</p>
<p><strong>ronelles</strong>: Yes, Betty?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Screw this dump. It’s a roach motel with
sequins. Every guy I meet is either married, a cop, or a lush from Des
Moines.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: But what about us?</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: You taught us the act. The songs, all the
moves.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: And where did it get me? I’m stuck in this
rathole! You’re holding me back, just like Vince! I should be
headlining!</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: What do you want? This is a private area!
Get lost!</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: You ain’t got nothin’ I ain’t seen.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Then stop trying to memorize it. Hit the
road.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: From Vince.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: His ashes?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: With love.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: From Vince! With love!</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Michelle and Tina can’t restrain themselves:
they open the box. Inside is a rather gaudy fur coat. Michelle and Tina
are impressed.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: It’s a fur!</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: It’s new!</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: It’s a bribe. Five years of my goddamned
life!</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: So you earned it!</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Vince owns the casino! Cash in</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: I should throw this in his facet</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Oh, Jesus. What is going on here? Why me?
Whose dog did I kill?</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Hi, Lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Hello, Eddie.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: From Vince? What a guy. Doo-lang, doo-
lang.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: At least he’s not a cop. At least he can
afford a decent gift.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I used to buy.you,..stuff. On your birthday .
When we were seeing each other.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Yeah, like what? Quilted coat hangers, that
your mother picked out? Lottery tickets? A travel iron?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: So I don’t shop.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: ’Cause you’re always out, arresting people.
Making trouble. I don’t know why I went out with you in the first place,
it was embarrassing! I couldn’t hold my head up, I used to tell people
you were a security guard!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Oh, yeah? Well, how do you think I felt? You
were singing in bowling alleys back then. I told people you were a
hooker!</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Calm down, you two. It’s always like
this.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Yeah, well, now, she goes out with a’ better
class of people. Vince Laflocca.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: He’s a businessman.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: A what? When are you qonna wake up?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: When are you gonna get off my case? Have
you got a search warrant? What do you want – cheap thrills?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Information, baby. I thought maybe somebody
around here might have a conscience.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Think again! And get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I’m going. My regards to Vince, And the
Mrs.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Ladies.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: That’s it! I’m not taking it from him, and
I’m not taking it from Vince! From now on, it’s all about me! And if I
can’t spend it, drink it, or sleep with it – it’s gone. Like Sister
Immaculata used to say, “Life is short, and then you fry.” So long,
girls – see you in church!</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Ernie Schmidt. How long you been with us,
Ernie Schmidt?</p>
<p><strong>ernie</strong>: Three years, Mr. LaRocca. One behind the bar,
two as croupier.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Ernie, you know what’s important to me? What
counts? It’s not all this. This is ’– what? Frosting. Loyalty. That’s
me, Ernie. That’s home.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: You ain’t been loyal, Ernie. What did you
tell the cops?</p>
<p><strong>ernie</strong>: I didn’t tell the cops anything. I swear.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Joey?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Who else, Ernie? Who else was in on it?</p>
<p><strong>ernie</strong>: No one…</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Why am I wasting my time?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Won’t need that anymore. Ta-ta.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Do it.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Stuff this up your…</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Babe.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Christy. Is there a problem? With the
coat?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: No… it’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Thanks. A lot.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Is that why you came up here, Christy? To
thank me?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: And to say you’re sorry. About this
afternoon. And the things you said. Forgotten. Completely. Do you
understand? Forgotten.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Right. Yeah. Forgotten.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: That’s my girl. My girl in mink. Will you be
home? Soon?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Right. I’ll be… at the apartment. Call me.
Thanks. Again.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Mink. Wow.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Vince – is she… okay?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I mean, won’t she talk? She seemed kind of
upset.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: She did. Bring her back. Now. For a talk.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: And if she runs?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Take care of it.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Christy? He only wants to talk to you!</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Christy?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Christy?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Come on, Christy! There’s no place to go!</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Which way?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Right between the eyes! Down and out! The
guy was gone! I… I couldn’t believe it!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You couldn’t believe it? Vince the
Prince?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: I never said he was an altar boy, okay? But
he sent his goons after me! They tried to kill me! I’m not kidding!</p>
<p><strong>clarkson</strong>: Tough break. Whoa.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What did you expect? Vince is as dirty as
they come. We’ve been finding bodies around here for years.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: I don’t know anything about bodies! I mean,
he didn’t bring it home. He was good to me… sometimes. He was sweet. He
took care of me. Who am I supposed to go out with? He owns a casino. He
let me sing.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: He didn’t do you a favor.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Screw you!</p>
<p><strong>tate</strong>: Come on, she’ll sing great. When she sings for
us.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Sing – like testify? Are you nuts? I just
want you to protect me! You’re cops!</p>
<p><strong>tate</strong>: Busy cops. We don’t have time to be bodyguards
for anyone who comes in here with some cockamamie story. Mink coats and
laundry chutes.</p>
<p><strong>clarkson</strong>: Unless, of course, you’re willing to
testify.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: What is this, some squeeze play? Can’t you
just protect me without any strings?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: We could put you into our witness protection
program.</p>
<p><strong>tate</strong>: A hiding place.</p>
<p><strong>clarkson</strong>: A new identity.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: But you’d have to agree to testify. The whole
nine yards.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: And if I don’t?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Then-you run.</p>
<p><strong>tate</strong>: You wait.</p>
<p><strong>clarkson</strong>: You listen for the footsteps.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Then one day they find you.</p>
<p><strong>tate</strong>: They open a window.</p>
<p><strong>clarkson</strong>: It’s ten flights up.</p>
<p><strong>tate</strong>: Ten flights down.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Ten flights?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You’d lose. You’d die. All over the sidewalk.
And into the street.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: All right! I get the picture! I’ll do it!
I’ll testify!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Get a stenographer.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Okay, here’s what I want. I know about this
stuff. A five-star hotel. With room service.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Maybe Hawaii.</p>
<p><strong>clarkson</strong>: Diamond Head.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Yeah. And I’ll need a new look. Like a
disguise.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Maybe Armani.</p>
<p><strong>clarkson</strong>: No – Calvin Klein.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: For sportswear. And a limo. And my hair –
up?</p>
<p><strong>clarkson</strong>: It could work.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Jesus, what do you think this is – Wheel of
Fortune? Let me spell it out for you. You have to hide like you don’t
even exist. You have to get so far hidden away that you never see
sunlight.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Okay – no limo.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: No nothing.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: What’re you gonna do, put me in a bag and
bury me?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I’m gonna put you in the last place on Earth
that Vince would ever look for you.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: I hate you. I totally hate you.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Safest place in the world. You think Vince
would look for you here?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Nuns, Eddie. There are nuns here.
Everywhere. It’s crawling with ’em.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: It’s a convent. All you have to do is shut
up, behave yourself, and get along.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: With nuns? With rulers? No way. I’m gonna
go back, work things out with Vince.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Vince has put out a contract on you. A
hundred grand. You’ve seen him in action.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: But… but Vince loves me. How could he… I
mean, five years…</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: And one bullet. That’s all it’s gonna
take.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: But Vince has contacts all over the place!
This is San Francisco! They’ll be looking for me!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Everywhere but this little hole-in-the- wall
convent. Nobody knows you’re here but me. We’re trying to get a quick
court date. A month, maybe two, tops. I’ll spring you as soon as I
can.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: I can’t stay here! I’ll crack up! Eddie,
what am I gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Pray.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Absolutely not. I am very sorry,
but no.</p>
<p><strong>o’hara</strong>: We can save this young woman’s life, and
imprison a parasite – all in one gesture.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: But she’s been exposed to the
underside of life. She is the underside of life.</p>
<p><strong>o’hara</strong>: And therefore an ideal prospect for
rehabilitation.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: We’re a small convent, Bishop.
Surely there are… more appropriate shelters.</p>
<p><strong>o’hara</strong>: Your small convent is in danger of closing,
Reverend Mother. The Las Vegas Police Department has offered to make a
generous financial donation.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: But, Bishop…</p>
<p><strong>o’hara</strong>: St. Katherine’s is a Benedictine Order. You
have taken a Vow of Hospitality. To all in need.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: I lied.</p>
<p><strong>o’hara</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>o’hara</strong>: Welcome, Lieutenant. Everything is in
order.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Aces. Bishop – maybe a cup of coffee, down at
the corner?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Hey, you’re not leaving me alone…</p>
<p><strong>o’hara</strong>: You’re never alone in this house, my
child.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: One month, two tops. Behave yourself.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Bishop…</p>
<p><strong>o’hara</strong>: Lieutenant?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: A convent? They put me in a convent? What’s
the problem? Wasn’t there any more room in Hell?</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: What is your full name? Your
Christian name?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Mother Theresa. Gandhi. Don’t you
understand? This is all a mistake. I’m the good guy. I’m the witness.
And I’m being punished!</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Your name?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Christy. Christy Van Cartier.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Enough joking.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: That’s my real name! Currently I’m a
singer. Sort of.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Very well.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Oh my God. This isn’t happening, tell me
this isn’t happening. It’s a nightmare, I’m back at St. Anne’s!</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: St. Anne’s?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Parochial school. Akron. St. Android’s.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: You were unhappy?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: I was expelled! When I was fifteen?</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: The reason?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Beats me! What do you think? Smoking! Heavy
petting, without a chaperone. Heavy petting, with the chaperone. And
wearing a black bra, under my uniform. The demon bra.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: You see? You see? I have to get out of here
I have to make a phone call. Don’t you get it? I’m in a convent! You’re
a nun!</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Sit down.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Sit.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Miss Van Cartier.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Your cigarette – out.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: It has come to pass.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: I joined this convent some thirty
years ago. At that time, the world knew some measure of peace. And hope.
Our order was a beacon of hospitality, to families, to children, to a
neighborhood filled with promise. And, as the years have passed, I have
watched that promise destroyed. Drugs. Gangs.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Are you talking about me?</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: And all those like you.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: You mean black people?</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Absolutely not. I mean the wicked.
The heedless. And their Las Vegas concubines.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: What’s a concubine?</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Check your driver’s license.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Fine. Got it. Look, the way I see it, I’m
stuck here, right? I mean, I’m here or I’m target practice. So here’s
the deal – I don’t bug you, you don’t bug me. I’ll catch up on some
sleep, watch some tube, lay back and lay low. So just get me a key and
show me to my room, and do not disturb. Capisce?</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Of course. But it’s almost
lunch.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Cool. Is there a menu? Or buffet?</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Before we do, you might like to
freshen up. And you’ll certainly want to change</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: the same outfit she’s had on since the
night</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: How about a robe? One of those big terry
cloth jobs, with like embroidery on the pocket. “Guest of
St. Katherine’s”</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Would you like that?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: You should hand-wash that blouse, and send
somebody out for some things. I look good in reds, purples, hot pink –
and shoes. Five-inch heels. Fuck-me pumps. Oh, man – sorry. ’Scuse my
mouth.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Excused. Open the cabinet to your
left. You will find appropriate attire.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Can do.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: No! No! I can’t do this!</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Normally dressed, you are a sore
thumb, and you endanger us all. While you are here, you will conduct
yourself as a nun. Only I shall know who, and what, you truly are. You
will not disrupt the convent. You will not influence the Sisters with
your colorful street talk. You will draw no attention to yourself in any
way.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: But look at rites Look at this! I’m a nun!
I’m invisible! I’m a penguin!</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: As of now, and until you leave, you
are Sister Mary Clarence.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Mary Clarence? Like a guy? Like a dumb
guy?</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: The Mary is in deference to the
Holy Mother, the Clarence in honor of Saint Clarence Loyola. There are
three vows that every nun must accept. The vow of poverty…</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: No problem.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: The vow of obedience.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Like to who?</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: And the vow of chastity.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: I’m outta here.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Good afternoon, Sisters. I
apologize for my tardiness. I would like you to welcome a new member of
our order, Sister Mary Clarence.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Mary Clarence comes to us from a
somewhat more progressive convent. She is eager for a more disciplined
life, and will make every effort to conform to our ways.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Yes, Mary Patrick?</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: Reverend Mother, on behalf of the
sisters, I’d like to welcome Mary Clarence to St. Katherine’s.</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: As part of our welcome, I’ve had a
little thought, just for fun. Could we have our new friend offer today’s
blessing?</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Very well. Mary Clarence, rise
please.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: A blessing? Like, for lunch?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: For what we are about to receive…</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: may the Lord… prepare us and… watch us and…
walk through the valley and be our shepherd and… to the republic for
which it stands… God bless us every one, hallowed be thy name.
Hallelujah. Ave Maria. Boyardee. Amen.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Sisters, for the rest of the day we
shall declare a Vow of Silence.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: A what?</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Surely you are familiar with this
practice, Mary Clarence. Only when our lips are silent, can our prayers
truly be heard.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Silence? No talking? All day?</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Until sundown.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Oh my God.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: And Mary Clarence?</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: As a new member of our order, I
think you might also enjoy a ritual fast.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: A what?</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: A fast. To remind us of the poor,
of those who must endure without enough to eat.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: No food?</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: No food. Not until sundown.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: They grilled me for six hours in there. And
my hotshot lawyer – where the hell were you?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: It takes time, Vince. Slow and steady. We’ve
been through this before.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: So long, Vince. See you soon.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: He’s so damn cocky. This is different.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: It’s a bluff, Vince.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: You know so much. They’ve got Christy, and
we’ve got to find her. Get her 8x10, from in front of the lounge. Fax it
to every contact we got.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I can’t hear this. I’m an attorney, Vince,
and you’re just an honest casino owner. Object of a witch hunt. Innocent
victim.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Keep the message vague, but let ’em know. The
price has gone up. Christy Van Cartier – a quarter of a million. Dead or
nearby.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Is this all the food I get?</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Yes. Until breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: That’s tomorrow! Don’t you have any snacks?
Machines?</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: This shall be your cell, Mary
Clarence.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: My what?</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Your cell. Your room.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: You were right the first time. Is this
like, solitary? The cooler? Where’s the furniture?</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Our lives are simple. We have
little need for material possessions.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Right, sure thing. But what about, like,
appliances? Like a little color portable? Boom box?</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Useless distractions.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: It’s like the Stone Age. The room time
forgot. What about a phone?</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: And whom would you call?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Oh, I don’t know… Satan?</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Your cell is more than
adequate.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Right. So what do we do now? Ping- Pong?
Row over to the monastery?</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: It is nine p.m. Pleasant
dreams.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Wait. No. You’re kidding. Lights out? At
nine? My day’s just starting.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: I’m sure. If I were you, I would
use this time, to think about my life. And its direction. Or lack
thereof.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: What’s wrong with my life?</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: From all I’ve heard, just about
everything. Your singing career seems all but nonexistent, and your
married lover wants you dead.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: If you’re fooling anyone, it’s only
yourself. God has brought you here. Take the hint.</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: Sister Mary Clarence!</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: Come on, we’re late.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: What? What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: It’s after five. We have to bathe.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Five a.m.?</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: Isn’t it a glorious morning? Good
morning, Mary Clarence. sleep well?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: Is this like your old convent?</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: Which convent was that, Sister?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Which convent? It was, um, the Little
Sisters… of the Moonlight. In Vegas. Everybody used to come to Mass.
Frank. Dean. Sammy. Right at ringside.</p>
<p><strong>mary lazarus</strong>: Enough jabber.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mary lazarus</strong>: Progressive convents. Vanity. It
sounds awful. It sounds just like this place.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Like this place?</p>
<p><strong>mary lazarus</strong>: I like my old convent, in Vancouver.
Out in the woods. It wasn’t all modern, like here. No electricity. Cold
water. Bare feet. Those were nuns. It was Hell on earth, but I loved it.
This place is a Hilton.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Where did that come from?</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: I haven’t heard that song in ages. The
Ronettes?</p>
<p><strong>mary lazarus</strong>: Shirelles.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: You know that song?</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: 1961? ’62? Mary Clarence, that’s when
many of us took final vows. It’s the last secular music we recall.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mary lazarus</strong>: That’s enough. We’ve got to get to
chapel.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Anybody got conditioner?</p>
<p><strong>o’hara</strong>: We are a small congregation this morning.
Too many mornings. Something has gone terribly wrong. Where is faith?
Where is celebration? Where is everyone? Still, rather than regret the
absence of our neighbors, let us rejoice in the fellowship of those
present. Our choirmistress, Sister Mary Lazarus, has informed me that
our choir, while always superior, has been toiling especially hard on
this week’s selection. Sister?</p>
<p><strong>clarkson</strong>: There was a raid on a pawnshop in L.A.
this morning. The place was fencing stolen property. They found
this.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Jesus. Data-base hoods. It’s a wonderful
world. Beloved daughter missing. Reward of two hundred and fifty
thousand dollars. Please find our adored angel, we miss her so. Dead or
alive.</p>
<p><strong>tate</strong>: Vince is getting desperate. Where is she,
Eddie? Where’d you stash her?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Where’s who?</p>
<p><strong>tate</strong>: You won’t even tell us?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I wouldn’t even tell the Pope.</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: Good afternoon, young ladies. And
welcome to our Christian Youth Group.</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: Hi. I hope we’ll have some fun, and
maybe learn a little something, too. Now, today’s topic is something
very up-to- date – “Teenage Promiscuity.” My. Now, can anyone tell me –
just what is promiscuity?</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: Anyone? Yes?</p>
<p><strong>lawanda</strong>: Uh, it’s like, you know, doin’ it. A whole
lot. Till your head falls off.</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: Well, yes. That is one way to put
it.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Sister Mary Patrick?</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: I need to see you, at once. Girls,
please excuse Sister Mary Patrick for a few moments. Mary Clarence?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Girls, this is Sister Mary
Clarence. She’ll be minding you until Sister Mary Patrick’s return. Mary
Clarence, please assign a biblical passage. Do not attempt discussion.
Am I understood?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: I got it.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Come, Sister.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: So, hi there. I’m… Sister Mary Clarence.
And you’re… young Christians. I guess I should assign you this passage.
What’s good? What were you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>lawanda</strong>: We were talking about the wild thing. Teen
promiscuity.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Really.</p>
<p><strong>charlene</strong>: Yeah. Sister Mary Pat was discussing it.
You know she thinks it’s a sin.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Well… yes. Yes it is.</p>
<p><strong>lawanda</strong>: How come? Sister?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Well… because it’s in the Bible. “Thou
shalt not…” Thou shalt not.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Excuse me – just what are you all doing
here? At Sunday School?</p>
<p><strong>lawanda</strong>: ’Cause we love it so damn much. And cause
we gotta come here. Probation.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Probation?</p>
<p><strong>charlene</strong>: Yeah. We all got caught. Shoplifting.
Cuttin’ school. Cuttin’ up some bitch with a blade. So we gotta come
here. So we’ll be good, in the future. So we’ll learn valuable lessons.
And I learned mine. I will be incredibly good, I will never rip out
nobody’s nose-ring by accident ever again. Can I go now?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Yeah, you learned a whole lot, I can
tell.</p>
<p><strong>lawanda</strong>: Well, what would you know about it, anyway?
What do any of you nunheads know about anything? About doin’ the nasty,
or gettin’ high?</p>
<p><strong>conchita</strong>: Leave her alone, Lawanda, she’s just some
ol’ nun! Don’t pick on no nun, it’s bad luck!</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Okay, so maybe I’m a nun – so, you want to
ask me something? You want to listen, for once in your little lives? You
want to pay some attention?</p>
<p><strong>charlene</strong>: What about crack? You a user?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: I said I was a nun, not an asshole.</p>
<p><strong>keshia</strong>: Got you, Charlene!</p>
<p><strong>conchita</strong>: Dunked by the nun!</p>
<p><strong>lawanda</strong>: Well, what about the sex stuff? What if
some dude is after you, and he’s always saying stuff, commin’ on sweet
and mellow. Like, oh, baby, you know you’ll love it. Oh, baby, if you
loved me, you’d stay.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: And you listen to that?</p>
<p><strong>lawanda</strong>: No, but… I don’t know… sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Hey, I know, it’s hard. But do what I
do.</p>
<p><strong>lawanda</strong>: What you do?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Just tell him, I do love you, but I can’t –
I’m a nun.</p>
<p><strong>charlene</strong>: But, like what if you are doin’ it? What
about protection? Who’s responsible?</p>
<p><strong>conchita</strong>: What about them things, you know, for the
guy? Aren’t they like, a mess to put on? Don’t they kinda mess up the
mood?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Deal with it, sweet thing. It’s important,
nowadays. You just practice at home, with a balloon and a banana.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Mary Clarence!</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Because a banana is part of a balanced
breakfast. And don’t forget fiber.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: A balloon and a banana! Tell me,
Mary Clarence, what were you thinking?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Those girls were asking questions. They’ve
got it rough. I wish somebody had talked to me about that stuff when was
their age. I wish somebody would talk to me about it now.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: This is a convent, not a clinic. We
offer moral guidance, not hardware.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Have you been out in those streets? Do you
know what those kids are up against? You should help them!</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: We are nuns. We seek solutions
through prayer.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Sometimes it’s not enough!</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: You are correct. Sometimes prayer
alone cannot help a situation. Such as your own, for example. How do you
feel about physical labor?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: It never solves anything.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Do your recall the words of Saint
Peter, in Ecciesiastes 1:27? He spoke unto a wastrel youth. He said,
“Take up thy task, and know ye the path of contentment.”</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: In English?</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: How to put it… ah, Of course, Mary
Clarence. “No pain, no gain.”</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Baby, you know I do… of course… I feel it
too… I’m blushing… can you hold?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Soon, you gorgeous thing… tell me… how
lonely?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: It’s that call you were expecting, Vince.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Can you hold? Can you try?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Have you found out where Christy is yet? Hey,
bozo, you re on my payroll! You want to try making it on a cop’s salary?
Find her, and find her now!</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Raise the ante to three hundred grand.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Sorry, baby… you are? Totally? Not a stitch?…
Yeah, I’m naked too… inside…</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: The minute I saw you. I said to
myself, she’s a weaver. Have you ever used a loom?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Not in years.</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: Well, it all comes back, in just a
jiffy. I’m working on a wall-hanging, of the convent.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: To sell, of course. I hate to say it,
but we’re in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine’s. We need a new
roof, the furnace is going, and there’s no money.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: But don’t you get money? From the
Vatican?</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: Mary Clarence. Goose. We’re completely
self-supporting. Like all convents. Like yours.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Oh, right. At my old place, we used to…
wash cars. Groom dogs. So… nice loom.</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: Isn’t it lovely? Now I’ll demonstrate,
and then you can hop right in. You just draw your beater in, keep it
pressed against the pick, and open the shed. Then pass your shuttle,
beat, and open the next shed. Shuttle. beat, beat, shuttle, beat, shed.
Keep tension on the warp. Is that clear?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Just about. Show me again.</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: You betcha.</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: Shuttle, beat, shed. And watch your
heddles.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: I love my heddles. Show me again.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Mary Clarence – how is your weaving
progressing?</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: Oh, she’s doing just fine, Reverend
Mother -</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Really catching on.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Good. Mary Patrick, I need you in
the office. Mary Clarence, carry on.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: I’m sorry, I’m not a weaver!</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Months of work, and the loom,
absolutely ruined!</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Look, this isn’t my kind of thing! I wasn’t
cut out to make little tapestries, or knit little sweaters! I don’t do
that! I’m a star!</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Let me talk to Detective Eddie Mulcahy.
It’s an emergency. Real bad.</p>
<p><strong>eddie’s voice</strong>: Mulcahy.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Eddie, you’ve got to get me out of
here.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Not again. You can’t keep calling. Somebody’s
going to catch on to where you are.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: But I’m going insane! All these people do
is pray and work, work and pray! I don’t get it – when’s the weekend?
They have gruel, Eddie, that’s what they call food! Gruel – it’s like
Alpo for nuns! I sleep in a cell, on a board, and I pray five times a
days Do you know what I pray for, Eddie, do you have any idea? Check
your crotch, Eddie –anything fall off yet? Get me outta her!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Calm down. Look, I didn’t want to tell you
this, but we’ve had some problems with our protection program
lately.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Keeping our witnesses alive. We hide them,
but there’s a leak in the department, and they end up dead.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: You son-of-a-bitch!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I just need a few more weeks,</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: But it’s a nightmare! Mother Superior is
out to get me! She hates my guts! She keeps thinking up new kinds of
torture!</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Do you hear that? That choir? Eddie, in
here, that’s what they call music!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Don’t call again. It’s not safe. I’ll be in
touch.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: What? What does she want now? I did the
dishes. I oiled the pews. I dusted the hymnals. Two hundred hymnals. Why
can’t people share?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: I… I brought you something.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: A cigarette?</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: An extra heel of bread. Please take it,
you need your strength. You’ve been working so hard.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Thanks. So which one are you? Sister Bruce?
Sister Doug?</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: Mary Robert. I’m… Mary Robert.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Right. Okay. Bob. Nice to know you.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: So, Bob, how long have you been in?
St. K’s?</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: Three years. Sister.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Three years. A rookie.</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: A novice.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Yeah, like a learner’s permit, right? When
do you hit the big time? You know, when do you take the final vows?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Whoa! Bob! What’s going on here? What’d I
say?</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: You have to help me</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Right, sure, but what’s the problem? Are
they keeping you a prisoner here? Do they drug you? Did Reverend Mother
like, kidnap your parents? We can call the Enquirer.</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: No, you don’t understand – I don’t want
to get out! I want to get in?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: Oh. Mary Clarence, I’m so unworthy. I
want to take my final vows, I would do it tomorrow, but Reverend Mother
won’t let me!</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: She won’t? Why not?</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: She says I should wait. She says that
no one should become a nun as an escape from life. She says that I’m not
experienced enough to make the decision yet. In a mature manner.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: She said that? Reverend Mother?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Well, then there’s only one thing to
do.</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Reverend Mother says you need experience,
right, in life. In order to make a responsible decision. This is going
to be very painful for me. You know how much I love this little room.
This whole convent. Wait.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Must I do this thing, 0 Lord? Please help
me.,. yes, I know… I must put my selfish cares aside… I must think of
others… yes, she’s here… He says hi… yes, I understand… let thy will be
done. Amen. You too.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: We must do this sacred thing, Mary
Robert.</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: Of course! We must do it! It’s the will
of God! What is it?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: for the full spiritual</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: We hear you.</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: Are you sure this is what Reverend
Mother had in mind?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: I know it is. It’s life. Experience. Take a
deep breath.</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: Mary Clarence!</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Now you.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: It’s a start.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: How are you doing.</p>
<p><strong>lawanda</strong>: Hey, Sisters. Are you going in there?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: You know it.</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: We need experience.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: It’s part of St. Katherine’s new community
outreach program. How old are you? You shouldn’t be smoking. Have you
ever seen a diseased lung? Hand ’em over.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: And you, with the devil’s brew passing
through your lips. A mind is a terrible thing to waste.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Bobs</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: Experience! Right?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: A couple of bowls of chili. And another
round of these.</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: I have to do this. So I can become a
nun.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Initiation. You understand. Later on, we
make her wear her underwear on her head.</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: And she wants to be a nun.</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: Who are all these people?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: This is your neighborhood. Your turf. You
should get to know ’em.</p>
<p><strong>dude</strong>: Hey, Sisters – how you doin’?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Better now.</p>
<p><strong>dude</strong>: How come they let you out? Out of that convent
place?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Time off. For bad behavior.</p>
<p><strong>dude</strong>: Oww! A nun havin’ fun! I don’t believe it!
It’s good to have you ladies in this fine establishment. So… anybody on
the move?</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: I am.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Bob! What’re you doing?</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: I’m getting experience.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: You watch yourself!</p>
<p><strong>club patron #1</strong>: Do it, Sisters!</p>
<p><strong>club patron #2</strong>: Sway and pray!</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: Those people are wonderful! Why don’t
we ever see them in church?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Good point. Especially that dude you were
with. I’d like to see him down front.</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: Mary Clarence! You’re so… different
from the other sisters. Sometimes, well… sometimes you sound more like a
layperson.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Honey.</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: I can’t wait to tell Reverend Mother
about all my experiences. I’ve learned so much.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Well, you know, you don’t have to tell her
everything. I mean, nothing really happened. We just… took a walk.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Run!</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: Mary Clarence!</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Keep moving!</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Climb! Now!</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Goddamn it!</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: Mary Clarence!</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: Oh my Lord!</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Experience!</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: What was all that? Who was that man?
Why would he shoot at us?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: I don’t know, some people just don’t like
nuns. I wish I had a ruler.</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: We could have been killed! But you
saved me! Thank you, Mary Clarence!</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Yes – thank you so much.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: What’d she say?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You blew it – big time. She doesn’t want you
back.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Does she know people are trying to kill me
out there?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: She’s counting on it. She’s concerned for
your safety, but she wants me to try and find another convent that will
take you. Or a carnival.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: So what am I supposed to do in the
meantime?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Go in and talk to her. It can’t hurt. Go.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: So… hi there.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: I don’t believe we have anything to
say to each other.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Look… I know I shouldn’t have, I’m
incredibly sorry about Mary Robert, I wasn’t thinking, I didn’t know
that would happen!</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Mary Robert’s life was in danger!
Your behavior was inexcusable!</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: I know! I’m sorry I didn’t mean for it to
happen! And I was the one they were shooting at!</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Mary Clarence, I have given you
every opportunity. To change. To make a decent life for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: A decent life? Excuse me? As what? A
janitor?</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Clearly, you have learned nothing.
And you present an ongoing threat, both to this convent and to
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: But you can’t kick me out! Guys want to
kill me! You’re a nun! A big nun! Aren’t you supposed to have
compassion? For the wayward sheep? I mean, I’m a major sinner! All-time
great! Hall of Fame! Aren’t I, like, your dream come true? Your Olympic
event?</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Mary Clarence, perhaps you are
correct.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: I am?</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: You may stay. But I shall restrict
your activities to but a single task.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: You have, I believe, some minimal
background in music. Therefore, you are to join our choir.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: You will sing, and you will sleep,’
that is your schedule until you depart. As almost no one attends Mass,
you will be unable to cause further damage.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: No. No.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: You’re my Olympic event.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Not the choir, please, anything but that.
The choir – I mean, have you heard them? I’ll do anything, scrub floors,
toilets, you name it, but not that I</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: The choir, Mary Clarence. Go for
the gold.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Is this… choir practice?</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: Sure is! Come on in, and sing a
spell.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Mary Robert, I am so sorry about last
night…</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: Now stop that. You didn’t shoot at me.
You were only trying to help, to give me experience. I tried to explain
that to Reverend Mother, but – I don’t know if she understood.</p>
<p><strong>mary lazarus</strong>: Soprano or alto?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Whatever.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: We’re looking for Mike.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: You found him – but we’re not open yet.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Hey – the till’s empty!</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: I’m sorry – I don’t know what gets into
him.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Who are you guys?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: We’re the guys from Vegas. You had Christy
last night, but you let her get away. It’s upsetting.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: But you didn’t tell me!</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: We didn’t tell you what?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: That she’s a nun! That chick you’re looking
for – she’s a nun!</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: What? Christy?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: A nun?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I’m telling you!</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Gimme a hand here.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: A nun!</p>
<p><strong>mary lazarus</strong>: Mary Clarence, are you with us?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Um, I don’t really know this one…</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: Mary Clarence has a background in
music. That’s what Reverend Mother said.</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: Really, Mary Clarence? Were you a
choirmistress?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Sure. Kind of… free-lance.</p>
<p><strong>mary lazarus</strong>: Free-lance? Oh really? You think I
don’t see? You think I took vows yesterday? I know what you’re up to.
You and Reverend Mother.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mary lazarus</strong>: You’re a ringer. She brought you in to
replace me. Out with the old.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Hold on.</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: Mary Clarence, could you? Mary
Lazarus, you’re terrific, but… Could you help us?</p>
<p><strong>another nun</strong>: Please?</p>
<p><strong>another nun</strong>: You’ve heard us.</p>
<p><strong>mary lazarus</strong>: Well.</p>
<p><strong>mary lazarus</strong>: There’s a word for this – mutiny. So,
Mary Clarence, you think you can do better. I believe I’d like to see
that. I’m out to pasture. Dry dock. The glue factory. Go ahead, Sister –
make ’em sing.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Well… With all due respect… let’s have a
look at this.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Man. I sound like you guys.</p>
<p><strong>mary lazarus</strong>: Very nice. Sisters, have we learned
our lesson? I won’t hold this little episode against anyone. I’ll try
not to.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Mary Robert.</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Mary Robert, I’ve watched you. You never
really sing. You whisper. Nothing comes out.</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: I don’t want to mess anyone up…</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Give me a C.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Louder! Like you’re onstage.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Like people are eating, and there’s
silverware, and you want them to hear you.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Think about that guy you were dancing
with!</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: Oh my!</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: You see? We’ve got the voices. They’re just
allover the place. I’ve heard all of you, in the shower –you’re decent.
Better than me. We just need charts – harmony – chops.</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: Chops?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: The goods. The sound. The sale. Let’s
rearrange a few things. Mary Patrick, you re not a natural soprano,
you’re an alto. Get over here. Mary Robert –with the sopranos.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Sister Alma – a C.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Middle section, hold that note, for dear
life. Sopranos, an A. Sister Alma?</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: We did it! We actually sang a
chord!</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: That was exciting!</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Yeah, for one second. That was the blend –
you’ve got to listen to each other. Be a group.</p>
<p><strong>mary lazarus</strong>: I knew that.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Mary Lazarus, I get the feeling that you
like discipline. Hard work.</p>
<p><strong>mary lazarus</strong>: Of course. I’m a nun. Four Popes now.
The Lord hates a loafer.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: I hear you. How many days a week do you
rehearse?</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: Two days. An hour or so.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: No way. We’re a choir, right? Headliners.
The big room. Two days a week won’t cut it. Every day.</p>
<p><strong>mary lazarus</strong>: She’s good.</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: Do you really think we could do it? Get
better?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: I don’t know. Mary Lazarus, what do you
think? They’re pretty raw.</p>
<p><strong>mary lazarus</strong>: Wet behind the ears.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: A bunch of real mama’s girls.</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: Oh, please? Can’t we try?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: It’ll be hell.</p>
<p><strong>mary lazarus</strong>: Tell me about it.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Ten-hut!</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: That machine.</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: I know. It’s ancient.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: It’s a rhythm section. The beat.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Mary Patrick – do you remember the Dixie
Cups?</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: The Dixie Cups? Oh my. I was just a
girl. Of course.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Hold it. Mary Patrick, you’re a pretty
cheerful person, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: Am I?</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: All right, I am, I know it! All my
life, I’ve just been… upbeat. Optimistic. Perky. I can’t help it. Even
when I was little, I remember my mother used to say, “That child is pure
sunshine. She’ll either be a nun – or a stewardess.”</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: So use it. When we sing hymns, they’re
usually about rejoicing, right? Celebration. Most music is. So don’t
hold back. Let all that joy go right into your voice. Make me happy. Let
me hear it. Perk out. Perk down.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Because we’re</p>
<p><strong>nuns</strong>: Good morning, Reverend Mother.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Good morning, Sisters.</p>
<p><strong>bishop o’hara</strong>: Welcome this Sunday morning, 0 ye few
and faithful.</p>
<p><strong>bishop o’hara</strong>: The choir, I am told, has elected a
new director – Sister Mary Clarence, who will lead them in Hymn 127.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: One, two, three…</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: What you say?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: But how?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: I think I hear it!</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: You know, I just might!</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Sister Alma!</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Mary Robert!</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: You know what we’re saying!</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: I think they hear you!</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Gospel. A jazz solo on the organ.
What next? Jesus goes to Rio? Good Friday-a- go-go? What were you
thinking?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: I was thinking Las Vegas. Get some butts in
those seats.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: And what next? Popcorn? Curtain
calls? This is not a theater. or a casino.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Exactly. People like going to theaters and
casinos. But they think church is for Grandma – we could change that.
Pack the joint.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Through blasphemy? You have
corrupted the entire choir!</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Hold on. That’s not fair. I worked hard
with them. They gave up their free time, and they loved it. Those women
are happy. And we can get even better. We can wake this place up.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Out of the question.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Please let me try. I’m begging you.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: And I am refusing. As of tomorrow,
Mary Lazarus will resume her leadership of the choir.</p>
<p><strong>bishop o’hara</strong>: Reverend Mother, I just wanted to
congratulate you.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Oh?</p>
<p><strong>bishop o’hara</strong>: I haven’t enjoyed Mass this much in
years. What a marvelous program. Innovative. Inspiring. You are to be
commended.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Well… thank you.</p>
<p><strong>bishop o’hara</strong>: I can’t wait until next Sunday, when
the choir performs again. Did you see the people walk right in from the
street? That music, that heavenly music – it called to them.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Perhaps.</p>
<p><strong>bishop o’hara</strong>: I must tell the Cardinal. I.11 send
him a personal letter, describing your efforts, your bold new fight to
keep your little convent alive.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Excuse me, Bishop. Reverend Mother has some
other ideas too. She’s too modest to talk about it, but she thinks we
should get out of the convent and into the neighborhood more. This
woman.</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: Bless her! There are so many problems
in this neighborhood that we could help solve. That’s why many of us
became nuns. It’s marvelous, Reverend Mother.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Really…</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: You know Reverend Mother. Hides her light
under a bushel. She has plans for us to move right onto the streets. Get
to know people. Work with ’em.</p>
<p><strong>bishop o’hara</strong>: You’re a pioneer.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: But, Bishop, surely you realize –
this is a most dangerous neighborhood.</p>
<p><strong>o’hara</strong>: And you’ll face that danger head-on. As if I
could stop you. And you have my complete support in this matter.
Anything you can do to revitalize this neighborhood would be a
blessing.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Don’t you love her?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Don’t look at your feet, and I don’t want
to see anybody counting. Make it look easy. Again!</p>
<p><strong>mary lazarus</strong>: Right, right, cross with the left,
spin and turn!</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Hopeless I</p>
<p><strong>mary lazarus</strong>: Amateurs 2</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Babies</p>
<p><strong>mary lazarus</strong>: Again!</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: We’re here to pray for you, brother.</p>
<p><strong>dealer</strong>: What? Get the hell out of here.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: We know you don’t want to sell drugs. You
just had an unhappy childhood, and maybe a learning disability. You just
need someone to pray for you.</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: We know you don’t want to bring pain
and misery to your friends and neighbors. We’ll pray to find you some
honest work.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: And we know that, even though most people
would call you a leech and a parasite, the lowest slug of humanity! We
know that deep down inside, you’re probably even worse. And so you truly
need our prayers.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: What is this? Outta my way!</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Yes, prayer is the answer, and prayers free
We’re going to give free prayers to everyone who drives up to this
house.</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: We’re nuns!</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: Free prayers right over here! Drive up
and get your prayers!</p>
<p><strong>dealer</strong>: You’re hassling my customers! That’s not
legal! I know my rights. This is restriction of trade.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: You wanna call a cop?</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: Are you going to shoot us all, tough
guy?</p>
<p><strong>mary lazarus</strong>: Is it worth it? A lot of witnesses
here.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Can I get a witness?</p>
<p><strong>dealer</strong>: So I’ll find another neighborhood to do my
business. You can’ t stop me.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: If we can stop you here, they can stop you
there.</p>
<p><strong>news reporter</strong>: It was a truly remarkable scene, as
the nuns from St. Katherine’s literally drove the crack dealers from the
neighborhood, led by the feisty Sister Mary Clarence.</p>
<p><strong>connie</strong>: Vinnie, get in here. You gotta see this!</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: What? Nuns? You got me in here to see nuns?
Isn’t there a ball game on or something?</p>
<p><strong>connie</strong>: Look – she’s adorable!</p>
<p><strong>news reporter</strong>: This tiny convent has experienced an
amazing turnaround. The sisters have revitalized and taken back their
neighborhood, all due to the energy and talent of the convent choir, a
group led by this gifted young nun. Tell us, Mary Clarence1 what makes
you so special?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Oh, I’m not special, Bob. It’s just hard
work… and prayer.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Eddie! You scared the hell out of me!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What if I was Vince? You’d be dead right now.
What are you doing giving interviews on TV?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: It wasn’t my fault! They just showed up.
It’s helping the convent.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You’re supposed to be hiding out!</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: I really can’t talk about it now. The place
is packed. SRO. I’ve got a show to do.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Listen to yourself. This isn’t a career
opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: I know that. This isn’t about me. It’s
about the choir. You should hear them. They’re good. Really good. And I
taught them.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Jesus, look at you You’re glowing.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: I am?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Yeah. You look… great. I mean it..</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Really? Lieutenant?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I’ve been worried about you.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: You mean – worried about my testimony?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: No – worried about you. Personally.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Well.. thanks. I’ve been thinking about
you.. - sometimes. I mean, there aren’t a lot of guys around here. I
mean, sometimes I feel like… a nun.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Me too.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: You’re not… seeing anybody?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: No. Most of the time I’m thinking about you.
And now… you’ve really changed.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: I have?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You re sort of… radiant. your eyes are
shining. You’re rea1ly different…</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You’re… you’re a nun.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: We’re in a convent!</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: I’ve got to go.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Just remember - you’re a target. Don’t you
think Vince has a T.V.?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: I know, I know. I’ll be careful. I’ll
try.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Magic time!</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: This Sunday’s hymn is inspired by the
lesson of Mary Magdalene. You know the one. Mary Magdalene was a young
lady with a past. She was no stranger to sin. She was no stranger to
practically everybody. Many condemned her. The whole neighborhood. But
one man refused to do so. One man said, hey now, wait a minute. Listen
to the story.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Hey, girls.</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick and robert</strong>: Hail, Mary.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Jerusalem is a real drag. Everybody hates
me.</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick and robert</strong>: Oh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: People throw stones. They call me names. I
mean, really.</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick and robert</strong>: Really.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: But – wait.</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: What is it, Mary?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: That man – who is he?</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: He’s a carpenter.</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: He’s not like other guys.</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: He’s decent.</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: He’s kind.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: He’s… dreamy. He’s…</p>
<p><strong>choir</strong>: Yes, Mary?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Jackpot! Two buckets</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: This is so exhilarating! All week
long, I can’t wait till Sunday, when we sing.</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: I’d rather sing than do anything!</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: It’s better than ice cream.</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: It’s better than springtime.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: It’s better than sex!</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: I imagine.</p>
<p><strong>o’hara</strong>: Better and better, Sisters, you are truly an
inspiration. And I bear gladsome tidings.</p>
<p><strong>o’hara</strong>: I’ve kept the Cardinal informed of your
progress in the neighborhood. He has been most impressed. And he has
invited you to attend a special evening Mass at St. Matthew’s Cathedral
on Sunday night1 to sing for the Council of Cardinals.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: That is indeed glorious news,
Bishop. We will be honored to appear.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: And on such an occasion, I feel a
completely traditional program will be best.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: The council of Cardinals is perhaps
the most esteemed body in the entire Catholic church. They command the
utmost respect. Your more… secular entertainment would be wholly out of
place.</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: But, Reverend Mother – everyone loves
our new style.</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: It’s brought people back to the
church.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Isn’t that why we were asked to sing for
those Cardinals?</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: I believe this can be settled by a
simple vote.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: A vote?</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Of course. Mary Clarence, a convent
is not a totalitarian state. Most major decisions are made by the
membership as a whole. A membership that, I am certain, will vote in a
rational and pious manner. All those in favor of allowing Mary Clarence
to select a program?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: But… wait a minute…</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: The majority has spoken.</p>
<p><strong>bishop o’hara</strong>: Reverend Mother, as always, you are a
true leader. Gracious and understanding.</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: It will be wonderful, Reverend Mother.
You’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>mary lazarus</strong>: She’s a pro.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: I am certain the presentation will
be a great success. Congratulations, Mary Clarence. And congratulations
to you all.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: You sent for me?</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: You have a phone call.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>eddie’s voice</strong>: Good news, kid. I pulled a few
strings the judge has agreed to move the trial up. We’ll be in court in
a couple of days.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: That soon?</p>
<p><strong>eddie’s voice</strong>: Forty-eight hours – and you’ll be a
free woman.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Great. That’s good to hear.</p>
<p><strong>eddie’s voice</strong>: Hey, don’t thank me or anything.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Right, right – thanks.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Hey – your prayers have been answered. I’m
leaving. In just a couple of days.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Really. Well, that makes two of
us.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: I have submitted my resignation to
Bishop O’Hara. Privately. I have asked to be relocated as soon as
possible.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: But – why?</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: I must go where I can be of
use.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: But – there’s so much more to do right
here. And look, if it’s about me, I mean, I’m gone.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Indeed. After how long? A few
weeks? I have been here thirty years. And yet, it would seem, I know
nothing.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: But everything that’s happening is good!
You can be a part of it!</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: A part of what? Mary Clarence, it
is one thing to rabble rouse, to sweep into town and declare a holiday.
You have raised the Sisters’ expectations, you have excited and confused
them. They imagine this neighborhood to be some sort of delightful
ongoing block party.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: You and I know that life is not so
simple. There will be disappointments. Rude shocks. And you will have
vanished. How… fortunate.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Okay, so I just got things started. But you
could build on that. You could keep it going.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: I am sorry, Mary Clarence. I seem
to have misplaced my tambourine. Good day, Mary Clarence.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: But…</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Good day.</p>
<p><strong>christy’s voice</strong>: Come on… I’ve got a surprise…</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: Ice cream!</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: Mary Clarence – you shouldn’t have.
Where did you get this?</p>
<p><strong>mary lazarus</strong>: It’s a sin. It’s a wicked indulgence.
Is this butter almond?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: It’s contraband. Don’t ask. But I wanted to
give you a treat. A sort of… thank-you gift.</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: A thank-you? For what? You’re the one
we should be thanking.</p>
<p><strong>mary lazarus</strong>: Is there any syrup?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Well… see, at my old convent, I wasn’t
always… real popular. I was sort of selfish and… not real helpful. Okay,
I’ll say it – I wasn’t much of a nun. But now, thanks to all of you…
maybe I’m shaping up.</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: Mary Clarence, don’t be silly. You’re
an example to us all. You’ve taught us so much. We’re singing for the
Cardinals, and then – who knows? Maybe the choir can travel – to
schools, and nursing homes.</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: Maybe we can get some of the local
kids to sing with us.</p>
<p><strong>mary lazarus</strong>: We could cut a demo. Look for a
label.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: That’s true, wouldn’t that be great. Of
course, we never know when things are going to change. Any one of us
could be transferred to another convent, tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: Are you leaving us?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Oh no. We’ll always be together.</p>
<p><strong>mary lazarus</strong>: That’s what Diana Ross said.</p>
<p><strong>tate</strong>: You’re too late. Mulcahy just left.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: I need his signature on some things. They
can’t be processed without it.</p>
<p><strong>tate</strong>: Leave ’em. He’ll sign ’em later.</p>
<p><strong>tate</strong>: What the hell is this…?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Tate said you were gone.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I get all the way down to my car, and, of
course – where are the keys?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: I left the money vouchers with him. He said
you’d sign them in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: This is it. Get ready to move. No mistakes.
Grab her, get her to the Moonlight. We meet there, and we take care of
her. We’re on it. Give me the address.</p>
<p><strong>tate</strong>: St. Katherine’s Convent on East Barton. It’s
gotta be the place.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You’re the leak, you son-of-a-bitch!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Get him out of here! Downstairs, in the cell!
I want his ass locked up now!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Clarkson, get on the other line. Call Frisco
Central. Tell ’em to get two squad cars outside St. Katherine’s convent,
and stop anybody with an out-of- state license plate from getting near
the place.</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: The Council of Cardinals! I’m so
nervous! What if I forget the words?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Right to Hell. Just kidding. Where is that
bus?</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: It should be here any minute.</p>
<p><strong>mary lazarus</strong>: Dress rehearsal at four, performance
at 8:30. Sharp.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Reverend Mother! Quick! Where’s Christy?</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: They know she’s here! They’re on their
way!</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: The rehearsal room!</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: It’s here! Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: Hurry, Sister!</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Get moving. I’m right behind you.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Eddie…?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Vince knows you’re here.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Long story. His goons will be here any
minute. We’ve got to get you out of here ’- now!</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: I can’t go with you.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: I’ve got a show – at St. Matthew’s
Cathedral. We’re singing for the Cardinals.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You’re gonna be singing for St. Peter if you
don’t get your ass out of here!</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: Mary Clarence! Sister!</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: It’s no use. She just isn’t here.</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: It doesn’t make any sense. She was
right behind me…</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: We can’t sing without her! What should
we do?</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: We’ll pray – and she’ll be there.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Eddie – I’ve got to go back. They won’t
sing without me. I’m deserting them.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I think they’d understand.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: That’s not the point! They need me!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: They need you? A bunch of nuns? For what?
Moral guidance? Make-up tips?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: You don’t get it! It’s a big thing for
them, it’s like… Caesar’s Palace. Prime-time. They’re singing for the
Cardinals. It’s like… “Star Search.” If first prize was a trip to the
Vatican. They’ve worked really hard, they deserve this.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Nuns?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: They’re not nuns. They’re like.. people.
With one outfit.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: So that guy in the bar was right? She’s like…
some kind of nun?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Yeah, right – when I see it.</p>
<p><strong>lawanda</strong>: You dudes looking for nuns? They all went
to St. Matthew’s.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: St, Matthew’s? Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>lawanda</strong>: Praise the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What’re you doing?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Even nuns have to pee.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Okay, it’s me. Mary Clarence. Christy. It’s
Chris Carter. I need some help here. I can’t believe I’m doing this.
Okay, look, I know I should just get back in the car, and get the hell
out of here. Save my skin. I mean, it’s not wrong, Vince really wants to
kill me. Why do you make guys like Vince? But if I don’t sing at
St. Matthew’s… Mary Robert. Mary Patrick. It means so much to them.
They’re counting on me – and I like that. Maybe Reverend Mother is
right, maybe I am a bad influence, maybe I’m just some Vegas slut, but…
can we cut a deal here? I mean, I still don’t believe in, like, most of
the Commandments, and stuff in church still gives me the willies, but –
if I go back and sing, if I do a good deed, will you promise I won’t get
killed? All I want is a sign. Lightning. Thunder. Anything.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: No. No. Doesn’t count…</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Oh my God…</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: I’m late for church. Can I get a lift?</p>
<p><strong>cardinal</strong>: Is this the choir you’ve been speaking so
highly of, Bishop?</p>
<p><strong>o’hara</strong>: They’re just a bit nervous. They’ll be
fine.</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: We sound terrible We need Mary
Clarence.</p>
<p><strong>mary lazarus</strong>: We’re losing it.</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: I don’t understand. Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Her whereabouts are unknown, and we
must proceed without her. Pull yourselves together.</p>
<p><strong>floor director</strong>: Okay, Sisters, we have to move on
now. That was great, just great. Charlie, throw a spot on the pulpit.
Let’s get a balance.</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: You’re here! Thank goodness!</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Excuse me – where’s the rehearsal room?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: The rehearsal room is right this way.</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: Wait, this isn’t the way. Who are
you?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: They’re from my old convent.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Run! Take off!</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: Again?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Go!</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: But what do they want? Where are we
going?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: She’s got nothing to do with this. Let her
go.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Yeah, right to the cops. No way.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Mary Robert, don’t panic. Remember what we
talked about? Experience?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: You can handle this.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Go!</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: She’s gettin’ away!</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Forget her! We got the one we need! Step on
it!</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: You mean – they kidnapped her?</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: Yes – two men – and they had guns.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: She shouldn’t have come back. She
knew she was in danger.</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: But – why would anyone kidnap a
nun?</p>
<p><strong>mary lazarus</strong>: Were they Catholics?</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: She isn’t a nun. Her real name is
Christy Van Cartier, and she is a professional entertainer. She
witnessed a vicious crime, and has been hiding in our convent.</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: An… entertainer?</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: She wasn’t a nun?</p>
<p><strong>another nun</strong>: She lied to us?</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: But… but… she was such a wonderful
nun.</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: Look what she did with the choir. She
made us sing beautifully.</p>
<p><strong>mary lazarus</strong>: That should have tipped us.</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: Well, I don’t care who she is. We can’t
sing without her!</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: She’s our inspiration!</p>
<p><strong>mary lazarus</strong>: She’s the act!</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: Reverend Mother, I know that you and
Mary Clarence didn’t always agree, but – we’ve got to help her.</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: We’ve got to save her!</p>
<p><strong>mary lazarus</strong>: We can’t leave it up to the Feds!</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Calm down. Think clearly. Mary
Robert, do you have any idea who those men were?</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: She said they were from her old
convent.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: But… she was a showgirl. She didn’t
have an old convent.</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: She told us about one. The Little
Sisters of the Moonlight. In Las Vegas.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: All right. It’s a beginning. Las
Vegas, Nevada.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Mary Lazarus, find the Bishop and
tell him the situation. Everyone else – follow me.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Emergency! Open up!</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: The San Francisco airport!
Immediately!</p>
<p><strong>mary lazarus</strong>: Step on it!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>o’hara</strong>: There was a kidnapping. We think Las
Vegas.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Fifteen hundred for the run to Vegas.
Rock-bottom.</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: But we don’t have fifteen hundred!</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: We’re nuns!</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Can’t help you. No exceptions.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Young man!</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: We are nuns. We pray.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: We pray for good things. Food for
the hungry.</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: Peace on Earth.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: However, we can also pray for other
things.</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: Measles.</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: Lawsuits.</p>
<p><strong>mary lazarus</strong>: Tax audits.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Come, Sisters. Let’s go to chapel.
Bring your beads.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Wait!</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: We got her.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Babe.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Babe, what happened here? Look at you.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Good evening, Vincent.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: What, Vincent? This is me, doll. I know you.
What did you think you were doing? Running to the cops. Hiding out. No,
no. You’re sorry now, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: I am sorry for all my sins. And yours.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: She’s a nun, Vince.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: I love you, Chris. I always will. I gave you
so much. My time. My affection. A big-time career. And how do you repay
me? What’s the thanks I get? Where’s the loyalty, huh? Where’s the
love?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: You will be judged, Vincent. We all
will.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: What do you mean – judged? I don’t get
judged, baby.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: And who are you to talk? You were nothing.
You couldn’t even sing. I must have been out of my mind.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: She’s acting weird, Vince. Ever since we
picked her up.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: It’s spooky. It’s like she ain’t even afraid
or nothing.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: She’s afraid. Come on, tell the boys you’re
afraid.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: I feel sorry for you, Vincent. And I
forgive you.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Who gives a damn? Waste her.</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: It’s so beautiful…</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: And what a lovely name. Las Vegas…</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: And Gommorah.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: It’s done?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Not… totally.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: What’s the problem?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: She’s… she’s a nun.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Are you nuts? She’s not a nun. It’s Christy.
She’s a babe!</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: But, Vince, how do you know she didn’t like,
join up and become a nun when she was in that convent?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: It didn’t happen.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: She was real quiet and peaceful all the way
back in the car.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: No smart-ass remarks or nothing.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: I can’t believe this. Okay, I want both you
guys to go back there, and both of you shoot her at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Right. That way we’d never know which bullet
got to her brain and killed her first. It could always be the other
guy.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Okay, we got one-two-three, and on three we
both shoot. Got it?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Got it.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: One… two…</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Three!</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: You didn’t shoot!</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Neither did you!</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: I figured if you were gonna, then I wouldn’t
have to.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: That’s what I figured, too.</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: Las Vegas – she’s here somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: But where?</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: Look! There she is!</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: The Little Sisters of the
Moonlight!</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: But how do we get there?</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Stand back. Taxi!</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: It didn’t work, Vince.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: You were both supposed to put your guns to
her head and shoot.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: We both missed.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Okay, so the problem is still the nun outfit,
right?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: So, take it off.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Strip down a nun? You want us to fry?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: For like, twelve zillion eternities?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: I’m telling you, she’s not a nun! Get her out
of the nun outfit, and put her in some clothes.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Maybe pants.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: A sweater.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: And then we can ice her. No nun, no evil
eye.</p>
<p><strong>ext. las vegas airport - night</strong>: Eddie strides out of
the airport; he took a later flight than the nuns. A squad car is
waiting; Clarkson beckons him.</p>
<p><strong>clarkson</strong>: Lieutenant!</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: We got it all worked out.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Okay, Christy – strip.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: That… thing. That nun thing. Take it off.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: What’s she doing?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: She’s praying.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: And God bless Joey and Willy, who are only
trying to do their jobs. Pox fibula tibia vobiscum. Et marcus domino’s
pizza. Have mercy. Amen. I’m finished now. Help me up.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: There she goes! she’s taking the stairs</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Find Vince and tell him what happened. I’ll
take this side of the room.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Brace yourselves, Sisters.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Spread out and look for Mary
Clarence. Try to blend in.</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: Excuse me – has anyone seen a nun?</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: A Benedictine.</p>
<p><strong>croupier</strong>: Place your bets.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Red 21.</p>
<p><strong>salesman</strong>: You sure? How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>salesman</strong>: Red 21.</p>
<p><strong>croupier</strong>: Black 14.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Did you learn something?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Close off the block, but don’t move in till I
tell you.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Saving you. Move!</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Break!</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Get her!</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Which one!</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: The nun!</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Babe.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Sweetheart.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Move in. Seal off the exits, but don’t come
inside till I tell you.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: There’s nuns everywhere! Hundreds of ’em!</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: There she is!</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Which one?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Quick, there’s another way out of here.
Follow me.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: She’s heading for the lounge! Go!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Move in – now!</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: I can’t see anything in here!</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Willy – hit the lights.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Find ’em!</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: There!</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: No – there!</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Over there!</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Freeze! Everybody!</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Joey?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Right here. Let the others go – they have
nothing to do with this.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Joey – do it.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: But, boss – she’s still, you know, a nun.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: She’s a broad! Got it! Just some broad!</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: I guarantee you, she is no broad.
She is Sister Mary Clarence, of St. Katherine’s Convent. She is a model
of generosity, virtue and love. You have my word, gentlemen. She is a
nun.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Hear that? Now aren’t you glad we didn’t
shoot her?</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: Mary Clarence – you’re alive!</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: Christy.</p>
<p><strong>mary lazarus</strong>: Van Cartier.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: You know? About me? About everything?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Reverend Mother – Thank-you.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Oh?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: You saved my life.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: I’m a Christian.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Don’t you have a concert to go to?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: That depends. Sisters, you don’t know this,
but Reverend Mother’s been making all sorts of noises about resigning.
That’s bad news. I don’t know if we could sing, if we thought that was
true.</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: Not a note.</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: Impossible.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Then I guess you’re stuck. Life sentence.
No parole.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Very well. I hold you responsible
for all of this, For introducing a lounge act into my convent. For
utterly disrupting our way of life. And for placing all of us in mortal
danger. Thank-you.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Yeah, Eddie, thanks a whole bunch. Thanks
for sticking me in a convent. So you think, after all this, maybe I
really am a nun?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I don’t know. There’s only one way to be
absolutely sure.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Yeah, like what?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: I was good to you! You re nothing but
no-talent garbage! You’re a two-bit Tramp!</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: seeing him for the scum</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: Mary Clarence!</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Bless you.</p>
<p><strong>mary patrick</strong>: I just realized – this is the last
time we’ll all be together. We’re going to miss you so much.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Hey – you re supposed to be the cheerful
one. Why do I suddenly feel like Snow White?</p>
<p><strong>mary lazarus</strong>: You re okay – for a civilian.</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: Reverend Mother?</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>mary robert</strong>: Since Mary Clarence came to
St. Katherine’s, I’ve been shot at, kidnapped by Mafia hit men, and I’ve
tasted beer. Is that enough experience yet? For final vows?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: I don’t think so. What about skydiving? A
crank call to Billy Graham?</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: You have evidenced great maturity,
Mary Robert. We shall have a serious discussion.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: What about me, Reverend Mother? I think you
were right. I’m just a bad influence. Sister show biz.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Perhaps not. Perhaps we can all
use… a little Spandex.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Really? And maybe shorter habits, and women
priests, and sleeping late?</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Don’t push it.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: It’s true!</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Don’t you know it!</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: What did He say?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: It’s true – I know her.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: What a shame!</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Pay attention…</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Were you wicked?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Were you tempted?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: But I’m fearful!</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: And I’m tearful!</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Sing!</p>
