<p><strong>r u s h m o r e</strong>: anderson/wilson</p>
<p><strong>int. classroom day</strong>: A private day school. Twenty
10th grade boys are sitting in desks in geometry class. They are dressed
in school uniform, light blue shirts and khakis. The boys look dazed and
sleepy.</p>
<p><strong>mr. adams</strong>: Except when the value of the x coordinate
is less than or equal to the value of the – Yes, Isaac?</p>
<p><strong>isaac</strong>: What about that problem?</p>
<p><strong>mr. adams</strong>: Oh, I really just put that up there as a
joke. That’s probably the hardest geometry problem in the world.</p>
<p><strong>isaac</strong>: How much extra credit is it worth?</p>
<p><strong>mr. adams</strong>: Well, I’ve never seen anyone get it right
before, including my mentor, Dr. Leaky at MIT. So I guess if anyone here
can do it, I’d see to it that none of you ever have to open another math
book again for the rest of your lives.</p>
<p><strong>mr. adams</strong>: Max ? You want to try it ?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’m sorry. Did someone say my name?</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: Max with his eyes closed, smiling serenely,
listening to the applause. He mutters:</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Gentlemen, gentlemen, please.</p>
<p><strong>dirk</strong>: Shh.</p>
<p><strong>mr. blume</strong>: You guys have it real easy. I never had
it like this where I grew up. But I send my kids here. Because, the fact
is, whether you deserve it or not: you go to one of the best schools in
the country.</p>
<p><strong>mr. blume</strong>: Rushmore. You lucked out.</p>
<p><strong>mr. blume</strong>: Now, for some of you it doesn’t matter.
You were born rich, and you’re going to stay rich. But here’s my advice
to the rest of you: take dead aim on the rich boys. Get them in the
crosshairs. And take them down.</p>
<p><strong>insert hymnal:</strong>: Rushmore – best school in
country.</p>
<p><strong>mr. blume</strong>: Just remember: they can buy anything. But
they can’t buy backbone. Don’t let them forget that. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>ext. quadrangle day</strong>: Mr. Blume and the headmaster,
DR. GUGGENHEIM, come out of the chapel among the throng of students.</p>
<p><strong>dr. guggenheim</strong>: Are you free for graduation, Herman?
Maybe you could give us an encore. Nicholas! Copernicus!</p>
<p><strong>mr. blume</strong>: I don’t give a shit. I paid for the whole
damn natatorium. The least these little pricks can do is hear me
out.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Mr. Blume.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: My name’s Max Fischer. I just wanted to tell
you, I strongly agree with your views concerning Rushmore.</p>
<p><strong>mr. blume</strong>: You don’t say. Tell me something. How
long have you gone here?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Ten years.</p>
<p><strong>mr. blume</strong>: Then you’ve been living in a dreamworld
for ten years.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I know it, sir.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Your speech was excellent. Except I disagree
with your ideas about rich kids. Because. After all, we don’t choose who
our fathers are. But that’s really my only criticism.</p>
<p><strong>mr. blume</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>dirk</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: This is my chapel partner, Dirk Calloway.</p>
<p><strong>mr. blume</strong>: Nice to meet you, Dirk.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Thank you for coming today, sir.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I really. I think it is. You’re right about
Rushmore. Look around. It truly is a great school.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Anyway, nice to have met you.</p>
<p><strong>mr. blume</strong>: What’s his name again?</p>
<p><strong>dr. guggenheim</strong>: Max Fischer.</p>
<p><strong>mr. blume</strong>: He’s a sharp little guy.</p>
<p><strong>dr. guggenheim</strong>: He’s one of the worst students we’ve
got.</p>
<p><strong>insert cover of the rushmore yearbook:</strong>: It is called
the Rushmore Yankee. The masthead says Max is editor-in-chief. There is
a photograph of him laughing, surrounded by his staff.</p>
<p><strong>title:</strong>: September</p>
<p><strong>int. dr. guggenheim’s office day</strong>: A paneled room
with wooden floors, an old electric fan in the windowsill, and paintings
of ducks and geese on the walls. Dr. Guggenheim is seated at his little
oak desk. Max sits across from him and in an antique leather
armchair.</p>
<p><strong>dr. guggenheim</strong>: We’re putting you on what we call
sudden death academic probation.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: And what does that entail ?</p>
<p><strong>dr. guggenheim</strong>: It entails that if you fail another
class, you are going to be asked to leave Rushmore.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I see. In other words, I’ll be expelled.</p>
<p><strong>dr. guggenheim</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Dr. Guggenheim. I don’t want to tell you how to
do your job. But the fact is no matter how hard I try, I still might
flunk another class. And if that means I have to stay on for a
post-graduate year, then so be it. But if –</p>
<p><strong>dr. guggenheim</strong>: We don’t offer a postgraduate
year.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Well. We don’t offer it yet. And what about the
fact that I’m probably dyslexic?</p>
<p><strong>dr. guggenheim</strong>: You’re not dyslexic.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Well, I’m a terrible speller.</p>
<p><strong>dr. guggenheim</strong>: Just bring up the grades.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Do you remember how I got into this school?</p>
<p><strong>dr. guggenheim</strong>: Yeah, I do. You wrote a play.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: That’s right. A little one act. And my mother
read it and felt I should go to Rushmore. And you read it, and you gave
me a scholarship, didn’t you ?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Do you regret it?</p>
<p><strong>dr. guggenheim</strong>: No, I don’t regret it. But I still
might have to expel you.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Couldn’t we just let me float by? For old
times’ sake?</p>
<p><strong>dr. guggenheim</strong>: Can’t do it, Max.</p>
<p><strong>ext. quadrangle. day</strong>: Max and Dirk come out the door
into the cold. They head across the grass.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: They want to kick me out, Dirk.</p>
<p><strong>dirk</strong>: Oh, no. Not again. What are you going to
do?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: The only thing I can do. Try and pull some
strings with the administration, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>dirk</strong>: Maybe you ought to get a tutor.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I don’t have time for a goddamn tutor. You know
my schedule.</p>
<p><strong>backgammon club.</strong>: Founder: Max Fischer.</p>
<p><strong>int. library day</strong>: A long table in the Rushmore
library. Max is reading a library copy of a book about Jacques Cousteau.
He is also playing backgammon with a freshman named ALEX.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Did you hear they’re teaching Japanese next
year?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: That’s the rumor.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: And they’re canceling Latin.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What? I tried to get Latin canceled for five
years. “It’s a dead language,” I’d always say.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Well, I guess they finally heard you.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: At least I saved Dirk from the horror.</p>
<p><strong>insert fragment of note in book:</strong>: which reminds me
of a quote from Henry James: Try to be one of the people whom nothing is
lost.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Who’s Henry James?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What does this mean?</p>
<p><strong>librarian</strong>: It means try to be worldly.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You mean like smart.</p>
<p><strong>librarian</strong>: More or less. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’d like to see a list of all the people who’ve
checked out this book in the past year.</p>
<p><strong>insert scrap of paper:</strong>: Miss. Cross, 1st grade, room
121</p>
<p><strong>int. hallway. day</strong>: Max walks down a hallway in the
lower school. He is carrying the little scrap of paper, checking room
numbers as he walks.</p>
<p><strong>miss cross</strong>: I have seen wicked men and fools, a
great many of both; and I believe they both get paid in the end. But the
fools first.</p>
<p><strong>miss cross</strong>: Chapter fifteen. The Lad with the Silver
Button.</p>
<p><strong>int. blume international concrete. day</strong>: Mr. Blume
has a gigantic office with paintings of battle scenes and Viking ships,
a coat of armor and a statue of a discus thrower. The concrete plant is
outside the window.</p>
<p><strong>mr. blume</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Mrs. Blume wants you to pick up the twins
from school at –</p>
<p><strong>mr. blume</strong>: Tell them to take the fucking bus.</p>
<p><strong>int. car. day</strong>: Max is sitting in a parked Jaguar
with Dirk’s mother, MRS. CALLOWAY. She is beautiful. She is dressed in
tennis clothes and wears a terrycloth visor.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. calloway</strong>: Thank you, Max. I told Mr. Calloway
the other day how fortunate we are to have someone like you looking out
for Dirk.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: My pleasure. I’m just trying to impart some of
the experiences I’ve accrued to help Dirk. There he is now. Nice talking
with you, Mrs. Calloway.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: How’d the math test go?</p>
<p><strong>dirk</strong>: What math test?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I thought you had a math test today.</p>
<p><strong>dirk</strong>: No. Did you turn in your paper on the Berlin
Airlift ?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yeah, I got an extension.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: How’d it go?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I shook hands with her.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Big deal.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: And I gave her my phone number.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Buchan said he’d have already banged her by
now.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: He said that?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: That’s a really crude thing to say. That’s
Dirk’s mother.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: But I thought that’s why you picked Dirk as
your chapel partner.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What are you, a lawyer? All I’m saying is that
gorilla is a guest at our school for the year, so respect our women the
say way we would in his jerkwater country.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Mr. Blume!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: It’s Max Fischer.</p>
<p><strong>mr. blume</strong>: Hi, Max.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: How’s the concrete business?</p>
<p><strong>mr. blume</strong>: Oh, I don’t know. By the time you hit 45
you’re been fucked over so many times you don’t really care anymore.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’m sorry to hear that.</p>
<p><strong>mr. blume</strong>: What’s the secret, Max?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: The secret?</p>
<p><strong>mr. blume</strong>: Yeah. You look like you’ve got it all
figured out.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I don’t know. I think you just gotta find
something you love to do, then do it for the rest of your life. For me,
it’s going to Rushmore.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Hey, Ronny. Hey, Donny.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: Shotgun.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: I said shotgun, Donny!</p>
<p><strong>mr. blume</strong>: Get in the back, Ronny.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: I said, “Shotgun.” Get in the back,
Donny.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: See you tomorrow, Mr. Blume. Mrs. Reynolds!</p>
<p><strong>mr. blume</strong>: Did you invite that kid to your
party?</p>
<p><strong>donny</strong>: Max Fischer?</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: Come on, Dad. There’s gonna be girls
there.</p>
<p><strong>donny</strong>: I’d rather die. Pull your head out of your
ass.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: Remember what Mom said. Hugs not hits.</p>
<p><strong>int. auditorium. day</strong>: The school auditorium. The
stage is bare except for two folding chairs. A tall senior plays FRANK.
He is wearing a stocking cap and sunglasses. A fat kid plays WILLIE.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Wait a second. What time did the old lady
place the 911 call?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Ten-fifteen.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Meet me on the corner in ten minutes.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’ll tell you in the squad car.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Oh, and, Willie. You were wrong about Enrique
Sanchez. He died in his sleep.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Excellent!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Excellent. Irving?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Get some rootbeers for anybody who wants one. I
don’t want one. OK. Next scene. Frank, you enter stage right with a bag
of cocaine.</p>
<p><strong>int. barbershop. day</strong>: A small, clean barbershop. MR.
FISCHER is a white-haired man of sixty-five in a white a white barber’s
shirt. He has finished giving a buzzcut to a twelve year-old boy named
GORDON.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: May I see the back, please?</p>
<p><strong>mr. fischer</strong>: Hey, Max. How was your day?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Hm. I’d say 98% good, 2% not so good. I need a
signature on this geometry test, by the way.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>mr. fischer</strong>: Hm.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Pathetic. Just pathetic.</p>
<p><strong>mr. fischer</strong>: Well. It could have been worse. You
were right more than a third of the time.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Come on, Dad! That stinks! I can do better than
that!</p>
<p><strong>mr. fischer</strong>: Of course, you can.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: For once, will you please try not to look on
the bright side?</p>
<p><strong>mr. fischer</strong>: Sit down and let me give you a
trim.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Do you think I’m stupid?</p>
<p><strong>mr. fischer</strong>: No! You’re just not very good at
math.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: But I’m failing English and History, too.</p>
<p><strong>mr. fischer</strong>: Well. Maybe you’d be better off at a
school where there’s not so much emphasis on academics.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What, like barber college?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: No, I love Rushmore. I don’t want to go
someplace second rate. Besides, it would ruin my chances of getting into
Oxford.</p>
<p><strong>mr. fischer</strong>: I wish I knew how to help you. But I
just don’t. I’m sorry, Max.</p>
<p><strong>mr. fischer</strong>: You want to see the back?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: No, thanks. You know how I like it.</p>
<p><strong>int. the fischer’s house. night</strong>: An Archie
Bunker-type house. Max and Mr. Fischer sit on the sofa in front of the
TV having TV dinners.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You think I’m spending too much of my time
starting up clubs and putting on plays?</p>
<p><strong>mr. fischer</strong>: I don’t know. It’s possible.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I should probably be trying harder to score
chicks. That’s the only thing anybody really cares about. But it’s not
my forte, unfortunately.</p>
<p><strong>mr. fischer</strong>: It’ll happen, Max. It’s just. You’re
like one of those clipper ship captains. You’re married to the sea.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yes, that’s true. But I’ve been out to sea for
a long time.</p>
<p><strong>ext. soccer field. day</strong>: Miss Cross is sitting on the
bleachers watching her class play Capture-the-Flag. She opens a book. It
is 20,000 Leagues under the Sea. She puts a cigarette in her mouth and
searches in her pocket for a lighter.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>miss cross</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>miss cross</strong>: I like your hat.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Thank you. You’re a teacher here, aren’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>miss cross</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What subject do you teach?</p>
<p><strong>miss cross</strong>: Well, I teach first grade, so I do all
the subjects. Except music.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: And this is your first year at Rushmore, I take
it.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I see. How long have you been a smoker, if you
don’t mind me asking?</p>
<p><strong>miss cross</strong>: Hm. Let’s see. How old are you?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Fifteen.</p>
<p><strong>miss cross</strong>: Since I was your age.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You’re kidding.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You should quit.</p>
<p><strong>miss cross</strong>: You’re right.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: And I should mind my own business.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Where’d you go to school, by the way?</p>
<p><strong>miss cross</strong>: Harvard.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Really? That’s a coincidence. My top schools
where I want to apply to are Oxford and The Sorbonne. But my safety is
Harvard.</p>
<p><strong>miss cross</strong>: That’s very ambitious.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>miss cross</strong>: What are you going to major in?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Well. I haven’t decided for sure. But probably
a double major in Mathematics and Pre-Med. What was your major?</p>
<p><strong>miss cross</strong>: Latin-American studies.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Ah, that’s interesting. Did you hear they’re
not going to teach Latin here anymore?</p>
<p><strong>miss cross</strong>: This was more like Central America.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Sure. Central America and whatnot. But moving
on: they’re gonna cancel Latin. They’ve got to make room for
Japanese.</p>
<p><strong>miss cross</strong>: Really? That’s too bad. All the Romance
Languages come from Latin.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: They do, don’t they? Like French, probably.</p>
<p><strong>miss cross</strong>: Nihilo sanctum estne?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: That’s Latin, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>miss cross</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What does it mean?</p>
<p><strong>miss cross</strong>: Is nothing sacred?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Sic transit gloria. Glory fades. I’m Max
Fischer.</p>
<p><strong>miss cross</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>int. lunchroom. day</strong>: A crowd of MIDDLE SCHOOLERS has
gathered around Max. He is holding a clipboard. One of the kids finishes
signing a piece of paper on it.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Good. Now you. Sign here.</p>
<p><strong>insert piece of paper:</strong>: A long list of signatures.
Many of them are written in little kid’s handwriting. Some are neater.
Across the top, it says PETITION. This is written in calligraphy.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: The administration conference room. TEN
TEACHERS sit in chairs around a long table. Max stands before them
finishing a speech. The petition is tacked-up on the wall behind
him.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: In summation, I have only one question: is
Latin dead? Nisilum sacnus estne? Only you can say. Thank you for your
time.</p>
<p><strong>insert annoucement:</strong>: Thanks to part of the efforts
of 10th class member Max Fischer, Latin will now be a required course
for grades 7 through</p>
<p><strong>int. hallway. day</strong>: Max and a bunch of other kids are
reading this announcement on the bulletin board. Max is smiling
serenely. The others are cursing and looking at Max with angry faces.
Magnus Buchan is one of them. He has a strong Scottish accent.</p>
<p><strong>magnus</strong>: Bugger off, Fischer. Ya bleedin’ little

<p><strong>mr. blume</strong>: Why?</p>

anyone like you, either.</p>

<p><strong>max</strong>: Gladly. Your husband’s fucking a schoolteacher,
pardon my French. I thought you should know.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. blume</strong>: Why are you telling me this? Are you
trying to hurt Mr. Blume? Or are you trying to hurt me?</p>

weeks.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: She left you?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: How come? I thought she loved you.</p>
<p><strong>mr. blume</strong>: So did I. I guess maybe I am too old for
her after all.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Maybe so. Maybe so.</p>
<p><strong>mr. blume</strong>: She’s still in love with the dead guy,
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You mean Edward Appleby.</p>
<p><strong>mr. blume</strong>: Oh, yeah. She’s fucked up.</p>

<p><strong>miss cross</strong>: Oh, my God. Are you OK?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What?</p>

<p><strong>max</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: So this is where it all happens?</p>
<p><strong>miss cross</strong>: All what happens?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I wouldn’t know.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Why’d you dump Blume?</p>
<p><strong>miss cross</strong>: That’s none of your business.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I know it’s not. But I’m a little confused
right now. I mean. I thought you dumped me for Blume. Then I hear -</p>
<p><strong>miss cross</strong>: I never dumped you because we were never
going out.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: But it doesn’t make any sense. I -</p>
<p><strong>miss cross</strong>: Well, I am confused, too. But why don’t
we just deal with getting you -</p>

<p><strong>miss cross</strong>: I was married to him.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I know you were.</p>
<p><strong>miss cross</strong>: Although I will say Edward has more

<p><strong>miss cross</strong>: Right. One dead fingernail.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: How’d he die?</p>

<p><strong>dirk</strong>: I know, Max. Listen. I’m sorry I didn’t take
your hand when Buchan kicked your ass.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I got a few licks in. At the very least, he’ll
think twice about spreading that kind of garbage.</p>

right.</p>

build me an aquarium. I’m not sure how that rumor got started.</p>

would’ve built you one?</p>

the money.</p>

Mr. Blume. No offense, but I’m spoken for.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: No, it’s OK. He’s my friend.</p>
<p><strong>miss cross</strong>: Well, you pulled it off.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: It went OK. At least nobody got hurt.</p>
<p><strong>miss cross</strong>: Except for you.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Nah. I didn’t get hurt that bad.</p>
