<p><strong>mischa</strong>: Where to?</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Are you sure you got my bag in?</p>
<p><strong>mischa</strong>: What do you think? I left it on the
curb?</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: I’m sorry, I’m a little nervous. It’s my
first time in New York. Just a minute.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: I want to go to 526 East 5TH. That’s in the
East Village. My daughter said it would cost thirty dollars.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: I came to New York to visit my youngest
daughter.</p>
<p><strong>mischa</strong>: And where is she?</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: She would have come to the airport to meet
me - she wanted to - but … but, she just started a new job and, well, I
guess no one drives here.</p>
<p><strong>mischa</strong>: So, you come here all by yourself?</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Uh, yes. My husband passed away recently
…</p>
<p><strong>mischa</strong>: … Oh …</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: … And the children thought I should take a
trip.</p>
<p><strong>mischa</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: I’m from South Dakota. Where are you
from?</p>
<p><strong>mischa</strong>: Moscow.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Ohhh. Do you know the East Village?</p>
<p><strong>mischa</strong>: Oh, yeah … yeah … it’s a hellhole.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: You mean it’s dangerous?</p>
<p><strong>mischa</strong>: Nah, not dangerous. Not that dangerous. Not
during the day.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Pardon me, Mischa. Is this 526 East 5TH
Street?</p>
<p><strong>mischa</strong>: No, no. Sorry, I can’t drive you to door.
There’s a roadblock on Avenue B … right there …</p>
<p><strong>mischa</strong>: This is one-way street. You go down the
block to the middle.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: This way?</p>
<p><strong>mischa</strong>: Yeah. Not far. You will be fine. It’s still
day.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: I see. How much?</p>
<p><strong>mischa</strong>: Forty-five all total.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Forty-five? I thought it was only supposed
to be thirty?</p>
<p><strong>mischa</strong>: Thirty is base price. Tolls, tax, tip … it
all adds up.</p>
<p><strong>mischa</strong>: Hey, lady. Hold purse like this.</p>
<p><strong>mischa</strong>: Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>squatter #1</strong>: Hey, lady, can you help us out with
some change today?</p>
<p><strong>squatter #2</strong>: Come on. Every little bit helps. A
little food, you know?</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Maybe some other time.</p>
<p><strong>squatter #1</strong>: Thanks a lot anyway.</p>
<p><strong>woman in a rage</strong>: You forgot your fucking plant, you
fucking asshole!</p>
<p><strong>woman in a rage</strong>: And there’s a lot of other shit in
there you forgot. Just wait there, I’m going to go fucking get it for
you, all right? No, just wait there! Do you want me to go get it for
you? Well, why don’t I just do that, huh? I’m going to do that right
now!</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Mom! Hi! I’ll be right down.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: So, what do you think?</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Well, once you’re inside, it’s nice.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: You don’t like where I live?</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Well, when I walked up the block, I … well,
my word!</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: That’s New York. It looks rundown, but it’s
safe during the day. You’ll get used to it.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: You take the M-15 bus all the way to … 79TH
Street. And then you take the crosstown bus to 5TH Avenue, and the
Metropolitan Museum of Art is right there. You can’t miss it.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: I wanted to ask you something. Those
motorcycles across the street …?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Uh-huh?</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: … What are they all doing there?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: That’s the Satan’s Disciples’ New York
headquarters.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: The motorcycle gang? Don’t they deal drugs
and rape young girls?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: I’ve never had any problem with them. People
say it’s the safest block in the East Village. I just hope their
motorcycles don’t keep you up at night.</p>
<p><strong>random voices</strong>: Did that shipment of heroin come in?
That old lady see them? We can kill her if we have to.</p>
<p><strong>biker</strong>: Oh, Marian …</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: You didn’t leave the house all day?</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Would you look at those strawberries. They
made the best jam. Here are some more pictures of the farm. Crops were
unbelievable this year.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Plenty of rain. Your dad would have been
happy with that.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: I just can’t seem to focus on anything these
days.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: That’s why it’s good you came to visit
me.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: How are you doing sweetheart?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: I’m good.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Dating anyone?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: No, I’m working too much, I don’t have
time.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: What about the fellow in those pictures?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: What pictures?</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: You know … … whoops!</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Mother!</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Well, they were right out in plain view.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Behind the books.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: But I was dusting.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: I was seeing Aaron and there were some …
complications.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: He seemed quite taken with you.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: I don’t want to talk about it.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: You know, you never tell me anything.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: That’s not true. Besides, I don’t want you
dusting. I want you to see New York.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Excuse me. Could you please turn your
motorcycles off? They’re so loud, I can’t sleep.</p>
<p><strong>disciple prospect</strong>: You’re just chilling, huh? Not on
this block, do you understand?</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Oh, no.</p>
<p><strong>disciple prospect</strong>: What’s this, huh?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I ain’t got shit on me.</p>
<p><strong>disciple prospect</strong>: What is that? You’re chilling,
man? Well, then maybe we need to warm things up for you, man. How many
times do we got to tell you? You don’t listen and you don’t learn and
that’s the problem. That is the problem.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: My daughter lives here and I’m her mother
and I’ve lost my keys.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Hello? Hello?</p>
<p><strong>disciple</strong>: Roast him!</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: All right all right all right.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Yes, is Paula there? … Could you leave her a
message, please? Tell her it’s urgent. Her mother has lost her keys and
is stranded on the street with the Satan’s Disciples … When she comes
back, would you tell her to come home as quickly as she can? … Thank
you.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Oh, please, don’t hurt me.</p>
<p><strong>disciple prospect</strong>: I just need to use the phone,
lady.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Oh, let me get out of your way then.</p>
<p><strong>disciple prospect</strong>: What happened? Did you lose your
keys?</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Have a nice day.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>disciple prospect</strong>: Washing machine repairman.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Maybe you should lay low tomorrow. I’m going
to see if I can get off early and maybe we can take the ferry cruise.
Okay?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Three left.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Okay? Does that sound like a plan?</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>marika</strong>: It’s Marika. Is Paula there?</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: She’s at work. I’m her mother.</p>
<p><strong>marika</strong>: Oh. I thought today was Saturday.</p>
<p><strong>marika</strong>: I’m sorry. I had a wretched night.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Oh. You need a cappuccino.</p>
<p><strong>marika</strong>: And there was this number on my phone bill
that I didn’t recognize. Calls made at three and four in the morning.
So, I called the number … and a woman answered. And I … I hung up. So,
then I followed him. Just like in the movies. And I found out that he
has a wife and a little girl living in Brooklyn. We had been going
together for almost a year.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Men … they’re all the same. Our pastor in
Sioux Falls was caught with his wife’s sister.</p>
<p><strong>marika</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Oh, it was such a big scandal.</p>
<p><strong>marika</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Poor man had to leave town. And I hear that
other women came forward.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: You know, you ought to come out to South
Dakota some time and meet my son, Steve. He’s single.</p>
<p><strong>marika</strong>: What does he do?</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: He’s an organic farmer.</p>
<p><strong>marika</strong>: Oh. Well, that would be a … change. Thank
you, Mrs. Peterson. You have a very reassuring voice.</p>
<p><strong>marika</strong>: I wish they wouldn’t come and go in packs,
then they wouldn’t be so loud.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: I wonder what they do in there? Don’t they
frighten you? They all look so …</p>
<p><strong>marika</strong>: … Manly?</p>
<p><strong>marika</strong>: You know, probably none of them had a mother
like you.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Excuse me, sir. I just wanted to thank you
for helping me get into my building yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>disciple prospect</strong>: Yeah, sure, no problem, you’re
welcome.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: My daughter lives across the street from you
people and she tells me that you keep this area safe. Is that true?</p>
<p><strong>disciple prospect</strong>: We like to think so, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: And you don’t deal drugs?</p>
<p><strong>disciple prospect</strong>: Who told you we deal drugs?</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: I’m just concerned about my daughter.</p>
<p><strong>disciple prospect</strong>: You don’t have to worry. She’s
going to be fine. We’re law-abiding citizens just like you.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: What about yesterday? Kicking that poor
boy?</p>
<p><strong>disciple prospect</strong>: That poor boy’s a crack dealer
from Alphabet City. We do not allow his kind on this block.</p>
<p><strong>disciple prospect</strong>: Is there something else I can do
for you?</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Well, I’d love to see inside your club.</p>
<p><strong>disciple prospect</strong>: You want to come inside?</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Well, if you’re not holding a meeting or
anything.</p>
<p><strong>disciple prospect</strong>: Her daughter lives across the
street and she was wondering …</p>
<p><strong>head disciple</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>disciple prospect</strong>: She’s curious …</p>
<p><strong>head disciple</strong>: What the hell … Come on in.</p>
<p><strong>head disciple</strong>: You watch your step here.</p>
<p><strong>head disciple</strong>: Hey, guys. This here is, uh …</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Marian.</p>
<p><strong>head disciple</strong>: Marian!</p>
<p><strong>a chorus of voices</strong>: Hi, Marian. Hey, Marian. Yo,
Marian.</p>
<p><strong>head disciple</strong>: Marian’s daughter lives across the
street and she was a little worried about her.</p>
<p><strong>disciple #1</strong>: Swear to God, lady, she’s not here.</p>
<p><strong>disciple #2</strong>: Hey, is she cute?</p>
<p><strong>disciple #3</strong>: Does she like motorcycles?</p>
<p><strong>disciple #4</strong>: Can she cook?</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: You know, this isn’t so bad. It looks like
our kids’ rooms when they were growing up.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Could use some cleaning.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Well, I’d better be going. It was nice
meeting all of you.</p>
<p><strong>disciple #1</strong>: Thanks, Marian.</p>
<p><strong>chorus of other disciples</strong>: Thanks, Marian.</p>
<p><strong>disciple #2</strong>: The food was outstanding.</p>
<p><strong>head disciple</strong>: You know, if we can do anything for
you, Marian, you just let us know.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Well, there is one thing. At night, your
motorcycles are so darn loud, I’m not getting much sleep. Now, I’m going
home in a few days, so … could I ask you to keep them quiet?</p>
<p><strong>head disciple</strong>: Well, we’ll, uh, see what we can do,
Marian.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>mr. palmer</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Don, this is my mother. Mom, this is my boss,
Don Palmer.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Oh, it’s so nice to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>mr. palmer</strong>: We’re very glad to have your daughter
working for us.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: I met the Satan’s Disciples today.</p>
<p><strong>mr. palmer</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Mother, I …</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: My daughter lives right across the street
from the Satan’s Disciples’ clubhouse, and I was so worried about her …
so, I went over and introduced myself. And they were the nicest
people.</p>
<p><strong>mr. palmer</strong>: Well, that’s a very unusual New York
experience.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: I had a wonderful time.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: And they were so friendly those young men.
Though I do think they should shave their beards and … and get some
nicer clothes.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: What do you say … we take a subway uptown
and see a play tonight?</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Mom … I mean, it’s amusing to imagine such a
thing, but … how many of those pills have you been taking?</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Oh, that has nothing to do with it.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: No, no, it’s my fault. I’ve been pushing you
too hard to do things on your own.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: The, um, other night, I got up to get a glass
of water and you were standing by the window talking to daddy. I called
out to you, but you didn’t answer. You remember?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: New York is a … it’s a strange place in the
summertime. The noise, the warm air, it’s … easy to imagine things.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Now, you know you didn’t go into the
clubhouse, did you?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: It’s okay. Dad’s dying put a lot of stress on
you. But you’re going to be all right. We’re all going to be all right.
Where did you get this vivid imagination, huh?</p>
<p><strong>disciple prospect</strong>: Yo, man!</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Mom, I need to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: If it’s about the bikers, dear, I don’t want
to talk about it.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: No, I had a dream about daddy. Do you think
I’ll ever meet anyone like him?</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Oh, I hope so, dear.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: You know that guy in the pictures you
saw?</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Aaron?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Yeah … turned out to be a real jerk.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: It’s unusually quiet tonight, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Mm hmm.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: I think you should consider coming out and
staying with me longer.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Oh, I don’t want to be in the way. You’ve
got your career and everything.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: You wouldn’t be in the way. I like having you
around.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Dear, I was thinking. Why don’t we go to
Paris next year? I’ve never been. Your father, God bless him, wasn’t
much for traveling.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: I’d love to.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Here you go. I think you should talk to
Dr. Byrne when you get back about how much Valium he’s prescribing.
Okay?</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: At my age, I’m going to take any pill that
makes me feel better.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Mother!</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: I can make my own decisions.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: I love you, Mom. I have to run. You
remembered to call the limousine service, right?</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Mm hmm.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Well, bye. And have a safe trip … and … Paris
in the spring!</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Goodbye, sweetheart.</p>
<p><strong>disciple prospect</strong>: All right?</p>
