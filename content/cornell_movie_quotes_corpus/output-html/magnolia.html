<p><strong>narrator</strong>: In the New York Herald, November 26, year
1911, there is an account of the hanging of three men –</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: …they died for the murder of Sir Edmund
William Godfrey –</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: – Husband, Father, Pharmacist and all
around gentle-man resident of –</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Greenberry Hill, London. Population as
listed.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: He was murdered by three vagrants whose
motive was simple robbery. They were identified as:</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: …Joseph Green…..</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: …Stanley Berry….</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: …and Nigel Hill…</p>
<p><strong>lumiere footage replayed.</strong>: Three men hug.
Bang…bang…bang…</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Green, Berry and Hill.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: …And I Would Like To Think This Was Only A
Matter Of Chance.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: As reported in the Reno Gazzette, June of
1983 there is the story of a fire —</p>
<p><strong>high angle, the tree tops.</strong>: The trees are on
fire….moments later….</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: — the water that it took to contain the
fire –</p>
<p><strong>water falls down…</strong>: dropped from a FIRE DEPARTMENT
AIR TANKER.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: – and a scuba diver named Delmer
Darion.</p>
<p><strong>firefighter’s pov, that moment</strong>: CAMERA dollies in
and TILTS up towards the top of the tree to reveal:</p>
<p><strong>fire fighter</strong>: What the fuck is that?</p>
<p><strong>angle, cu. delmer darion.</strong>: He still has his mask and
mouthpiece.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Employee of the Peppermill Hotel and
Casino, Reno, Nevada. Engaged as a blackjack dealer –</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: – well liked and well regarded as a
physical, recreational and sporting sort – Delmer’s true passion was for
the lake –</p>
<p><strong>the massive air tanker fills the frame, touching down on the
water,</strong>: FULLING IT’S BODY FULL OF WATER FROM THE LAKE. It
enters CAMERA RT. and exits CAMERA LFT.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: – as reported by the coroner, Delmer died
of a heart attack somewhere between the lake and the tree. But most
curious side note is the suicide the next day of Craig Hansen –</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: …volunteer firefighter, estranged father
of four and a poor tendency to drink – Mr. Hansen was the pilot of the
plane that quite accidentally lifted Delmer Darion out of the water
–</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: – added to this, Mr. Hansen’s tortured
life met before with Delmer Darion just two nights previous –</p>
<p><strong>craig hansen</strong>: …oh God…fuck…I’m sorry…I’m sorry…</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: The weight of the guilt and the measure of
coincidence so large, Craig Hansen took his life.</p>
<p><strong>craig hansen</strong>: …forgive me…</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: And I Am Trying To Think This Was All Only
A Matter Of Chance.</p>
<p><strong>angle, man behind podium.</strong>: CAMERA pushes in quick
then blends to 60fps on a man in glasses: DONALD HARPER, forensic
scientist as he speaks into the microphone.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: The tale told at a 1961 awards dinner for
the American Association Of Forensic Science by Dr. Donald Harper,
president of the association, began with a simple suicide attempt –</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Seventeen year old Sydney Barringer. In
the city of Los Angeles on March 23, 1958.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: The coroner ruled that the unsuccessful
suicide had suddenly become a succesful homicide. To explain:</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: The suicide was confirmed by a note, left
in the breast pocket of Sydney Barringer –</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: At the same time young Sydney stood on the
ledge of this nine story building, an argument swelled three stories
below –</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: The neighbors heard, as they usually did,
the arguing of the tenants –</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: – and it was not uncommon for them to
threaten each other with a shotgun or one of the many handguns kept in
the house –</p>
<p><strong>older man</strong>: Put it down, put that fuckin’ thing down
Fay –</p>
<p><strong>older woman</strong>: – I’II fucking tell YOU. I’ll shoot you
in the face and end this argument and we see who’s right –</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: And when the shotgun accidentaly went off,
Sydney just happend to pass –</p>
<p><strong>older man</strong>: You CRAZY FUCKIN’ BITCH WHAT ARE YOU
DOING?</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Added to this, the two tenants turned out
to be: Fay and Arthur Barringer. Sydney’s mother and Sydney’s
father.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: When confronted with the charge, which
took some figuring out for the officers on the scene of the crime, Fay
Barringer swore that she did not know that the gun was loaded.</p>
<p><strong>fay barringer</strong>: I didn’t know – I didn’t know –</p>
<p><strong>arthur barringer</strong>: She always threatens me with the
gun, but I don’t keep it loaded –</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: – and you didn’t load the gun?</p>
<p><strong>arthur barringer</strong>: Why would I load the gun?</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: A young boy who lived in the building,
sometimes a vistor and friend to Sydney Barringer said that he had seen,
six days prior the loading of the shotgun –</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: C’mere a minute –</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: It seems that the arguing and the fighting
and all of the violence was far too much for Sydney Barringer and
knowing his mother and father’s tendency to fight, he decided to do
something –</p>
<p><strong>young boy</strong>: He said he wanted them to kill each
other, that all they wanted to do was kill each other and he would help
them if that’s what they wanted to do –</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Sydney Barringer jumps from the ninth
floor rooftop – His parents argue three stories below –</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Her accidental shotgun blast hits Sydney
in the stomach as he passes the arguing sixth floor window –</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: He is killed instantly but continues to
fall – only to find, three stories below – a safety net installed three
days prior for a set of window washers that would have broken his fall
and saved his life if not for the hole in his stomach.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: So Fay Barringer was charged with the
murder of her son and Sydney Barringer noted as an accomplice in his own
death…</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: …and it is in the humble opinion of this
narrator that this is not just “Something That Happened.” This cannot be
“One of those things…” This, please, cannot be that. And for what I
would like to say, I can’t. This Was Not Just A Matter Of Chance.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Ohhhh. These strange things happen all the
time.</p>

you find and it’s not what you deserve - It’s What You Take. I’m Frank

<p><strong>marcie</strong>: It’s a free country, you can think anything

<p><strong>jim kurring</strong>: Yes I can, Marcie. And until you start
givin’ me some straight answers: I’m gonna assume that some mischief has

<p><strong>jim kurring</strong>: Marcie - CALM DOWN. CALM DOWN and don’t

<p><strong>jim kurring</strong>: This is the LAPD. If anyone is back

<p><strong>jim kurring</strong>: Marcie - quiet down! Now if anyone is

<p><strong>jim kurring</strong>: – do not do this – my gun is drawn and
If I Have To Open That Closet you will get shot – Step Out Now.</p>
<p><strong>marcie</strong>: I told you there was no one in there!</p>
<p><strong>jim kurring</strong>: Marcie - Do not drag that couch any
further!</p>
<p><strong>jim’s pov, camera dollies in slowly towards the
closet.</strong>: He pushes some sheets aside and burries around to
reveal:</p>
<p><strong>jim kurring</strong>: What the hell is this Marcie?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: …n’I dowanna do this…sit here, I can see the

she’s a good girl I think. She’s a little daffy.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: She loves you.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: …ah…maybe…yeah…she’s a good one…</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: When was the last time you talked to your
son?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: ….I dunn…o….maybe ten…five, fuck, fuck….that’s
another thing that goes –</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: – memory?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Time lines, y’know? I remember things but not
so – right there – y’know?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: “yeah.” the fuck do you know?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I’ve seen it before.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Other fuckin’ assholes like me.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: There’s no asshole like you.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: …cocksucker….</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: How come every word you say is either
“cocksucker,” or “shitballs,” or “fuck?”</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Do me a personal favor –</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Go fuck myself?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: You got it.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: …I can’t hold onto this anymore…</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I’ll get you another pain pill. Another
morphine pill –</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: …gimme that fuckin’ phone…</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Who are you gonna call?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: I wanna see this…where is he, do you know?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Jack.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Is Jack your son?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You wanna call him on the phone? We can call
him, I can dial the phone if you can remember the number –</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: – it’s not him. it’s not him. He’s the fuckin’
asshole…Phil..c’mere…</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: This is so boring…so goddamn… and dying wish
and all that, old man on a bed…fuck…wants one thing:</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: It’s ok.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: …find him on the…Frank. His name’s Frank
Mackey –</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Frank Mackey. That’s your son?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: that’snotmy name…find Lily, gimmme that, give
it –</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: ifyougimmethat….overonthe….fuck…. I can’t hold
ontothis anymore…</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Respect the cock and tame the cunt, boys.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: And you did hear me right. Tame it. Take it
on, head first – with your skills at work and say, “No. You will not
control me. You will not take my soul and you will not win this game.”
‘cause it is a game, guys, you wanna think it’s not – go back to the
schoolyard and have a crush on Mary Jane – respect the cock – you are
embedding this thought: I’m in charge. I’m the one who says yes, no, now
or here. Shit, man. Sad but true. Sad But True. And you wanna know what?
It must be the way. The thing about chicks and the thing about this
course that we’re going through today is how universal the whole thing
is. I mean: I wish I could sit here and say that it’s not – because the
reality? If each chick had something new, something really new that I’d
never seen before? Fuckin’ hell: I’d be in the money! Because I’d have
to create a hundred new cassettes, a hundred new books, a hundred new
seminars and hundred new videos just to deal with each and every
situation a chick could create - but that is just not the case. They are
universal. They are sheep. They are to be studied and watched – they
have patterns that must be stopped, interupted and resisted. I’d be
makin’ a fuckin’ butt load if they were actually as much of a challenge
as they want you to think they are! Reality: They Are All The Same. Each
and every one of them. And once you learn these methods: You’re Set. You
Don’t Have To Come Back. That’s it. In solid. Boom. Done. Over. Why?
Because all women are the same. Period. End of discussion. Sorry. It’s
true. Sad But True. And anyone who wants to say that these methods we
work by are “unfair?” Yes, they are. Guilty as charged. And so’s the
world. It’s a harsh, hard unfair place, but it’s not gonna stop me from
getting my fair shair of hair pie – Period. Sorry. End of
discussion.</p>
<p><strong>captain muffy</strong>: You’re Gwenovier?</p>
<p><strong>gwenovier</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>captian muffy</strong>: I’m Captain Muffy, I’m Frank’s
personal assistant. This is Doc –</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>gwenovier</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>captain muffy</strong>: We can go right in here. He started
about thirty five minutes ago, but it’s all getting pumped up now –</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Number One: Get a calendar. I cannot stress
this enough. This is a simple item guys. It’s 99 cents at your corner
store: Go And Get One. Fuck it, if you reach into your packet, you’ll
see I’ve been nice enough to include one, ’cause that’s the kind of
prick I am – You’re gonna need this calendar and I know it sounds like a
small thing, but having it makes all the difference in the world: If you
meet a girl and you’re gonna work an A-3 Interuption – let’s say an
eight day waiting period before the next call – how you gonna know when
those eight days are up? Buy a calendar. Next move? Mark the calendar.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. What did I pay my eight hundred dollars for? To hear
Frank tell me to buy a calendar and mark it? Just stick with me and
stick by the calendar. Mark it up – use it to set goals – If you wanna
make that “friend” something else – you gotta be hard on yourself, set
goals: You, there: And What’s Your Name?</p>
<p><strong>female voice</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Hi. Is Frank there?</p>
<p><strong>female voice</strong>: I think you have the wrong number.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I’m looking for Frank Mackey.</p>
<p><strong>female voice</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Is this 509-9027?</p>
<p><strong>female voice</strong>: Yeah. You have the wrong number.
There’s no one named Frank here.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Alright. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>female voice</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>gwenovier</strong>: Sorry I’m late –</p>
<p><strong>cameraman</strong>: – we’re all set upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>gwenovier</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: You have everything you need?</p>
<p><strong>gwenovier</strong>: I’m set, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Denise?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: That’s right –</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: – and she hurt you didn’t she? I know, I
know. I know how that can be brother, but let me tell you loud and clear
what we will be teaching Denise when we put our calendars to work and
set goals:</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Little Denise, I say this: I mark it up and I
write it down and you’ve been warned: “By the end of May, you will know
I’m not gay.” “On the fourth of June, Denise, you’re gonna be lickin’ my
spoon.” “And Come August, You Suck My Big Fat Sausage.” I’ve SET GOALS
FOR MYSELF. And what? I’ve said “enough is enough.” Because why? She’s
not gonna be your pal. She’s not gonna be your friend. You think she’s
gonna be there for you the second you need something? Think again - this
fuckin’ bitch Denise! But: Listen up: That is not to say that we don’t
all need women as friends, ’cause we’re gonna learn later on in Chapter
23 that having a couple of chick-friends laying around can come in real
handy in setting Jealousy Traps. But we’ll get to that. Number One in
your booklets, blue cover - go to it and</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Create a crisis – simple and clean, and if
done properly can be quite effective in getting some bush. Here we go:
Set a date with your so-called “friend.” Let’s say you make it 7:30. You
call her on the phone –</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: That sounds like fun, Frank. I love
seafood.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: So I’ll see you about 7:30? Great, then.
Bye-bye, Cindy.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You wait until about nine o’clock and you
ring the doorbell.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: She opens it up, pissed as hell, but finds
you sobbing your eyes out –</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: …I can’t believe what happened…</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You explain between sobs that you hit a dog
on the way over to pick her up and you had to rush it to the animal
hospital but by the time you got there –</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: …and it’s paw was sticking out… and it was
too late. It was too late.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Ohhh, shhhh…shhh…Frank…</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I can’t believe I’m telling you guys this,
but the truly terrifying part is that: THIS WORKS. Any girl that calls
herself your friend is not gonna let you be alone in a situation like
that. Technique #2: Staging a fight. This is not knock down, drag out,
crying screaming, yelling – this is a simple, direct and subtle way of
planting confusion into a girl’s mind. Remember we are using
reinforcement technique “G” with these women. Here’s how:</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: One day, she calls you up on the phone…</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Hey, Frank. It’s Cindy. I’m wondering if you
wanna grab a bite and see a movie?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You very directly say:</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: “I don’t think I have anything to say to you,
Cindy.”</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Let her wonder what she did wrong.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: This is the way…because they will always
wonder, “What did I do?” “What could I have done different?” “How should
I behave to get this back?” And if they think that way – then they are
asking for you to hurt them and That Is What You Must Do. That is what
you must do which is punish them many, many times over.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Mrs. Partridge –</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I’m here and I need to see him.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: – he’s fucking dying, he’s dying as we’re
sitting here and there isn’t a fucking thing – jesus, how can you tell
me to calm down?</p>
<p><strong>dr. landon</strong>: I can help you through this the best I
know how but there are certain things you are gonna have to be strong
about and take care of, now we can go over them, but I need to know that
you’re listening to me, ok?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I just, I just – I just – I’m just in a
fucking state, I know he’s going and it’s like I don’t know how – just
tell me practical things – What the fuck do I do with his body? What
happens when he dies? That next moment: What? What do I do? Then
What?</p>
<p><strong>dr. landon</strong>: Well that’s what Hospice will take care
of for you. They will send a nurse, someone who can take care of all of
that for you –</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: He has Phil right now.</p>
<p><strong>dr. landon</strong>: Phil’s one of the nurses from the
service?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>dr. landon</strong>: If you’re happy with Phil taking care of
him and helping you, that’s fine, but contact Hospice to arrange for the
body –</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: – you don’t understand: it’s more pain than
before and the fucking morphine pills aren’t working, he’s – past two
days it’s like he can’t really swallow them and I don’t know if they’re
going down – I can’t see inside his mouth anymore – I’m up all night
staring at him and I don’t think the pills are going down and he moans
and he hurts –</p>
<p><strong>dr. landon</strong>: We can fix that, because I can give you
– are you listening?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I’m listening. I’m getting better.</p>
<p><strong>dr. landon</strong>: Do you wanna sit down?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I need to sit down.</p>
<p><strong>dr. landon</strong>: Ok. Linda: Earl is not gonna make it.
He’s dying. He is. He is dying very, very rapidly –</p>
<p><strong>dr. landon</strong>: Now the thing here is making that
experience as painless and easy as possible for him, you understand? Now
you need to get in touch with Hospice care because they can take care of
all those practical things that you’re asking me about – they are who
you call when he dies.</p>
<p><strong>dr. landon</strong>: This is the number for Hospice. Ok. Now.
As far as the morphine pills go, there is something else to consider
that can take the pain away that he is in, there is a very strong and
very potent solution of liquid morphine….it’s a little bottle, with an
eye dropper and it’s easy to get in his mouth and drop on his tounge and
it will certainly diminish the pain that he is in but you have to
realize that once you give it to him; there really is no coming back, I
mean, it will certainly cure his pain, but he will float in and out of
consciousness, even worse than he is now, Linda. I mean, any sign of the
recognizable Earl will pretty much go away –</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: – how the fuck can I say anything to that – I
don’t know what to say to that –</p>
<p><strong>dr. landon</strong>: The job here is to make him as
comfortable as possible – right now – our job is to just try and make it
as painless as possible. Right? You understand?</p>
<p><strong>middle aged guy</strong>: Hello?</p>

things that I want to tell you –</p>

<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Please. It doesn’t have to be now. Maybe we
can make a date to sit down, I didn’t mean to walk in on you like this
–</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Why are you here, why are you doing this?
Coming in here – you wanna call me a whore?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I don’t want you to think that I’m that way
to you – I’m not gonna call you a slut or something –</p>

<p><strong>i’m not your baby, i’m not your girl.</strong>: I’m not your
fuckin’ baby –</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Please put your clothes on, please –</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: YOU BURN IN BELL. You burn in hell and you
deserve it – YOU GET THE FUCK OUT.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Honey.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Your mother wants to hear from you –</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>middle aged guy</strong>: It’s alright.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Can you get your shit and leave,
please?</p>

<p><strong>captain muffy</strong>: Chief, this is Gwenovier from the
show, “Profiles,” for the interview –</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Hello, hello, I’m a bit out of breath from
all this work –</p>
<p><strong>gwenovier</strong>: That’s fine. It’s nice to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Are we gonna tape some stuff now?</p>
<p><strong>gwenovier</strong>: If you’re up to it, I’ve got us set up in
a suite upstairs –</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You got us a room so quick?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’m kidding of course.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I swear to fucking-god, I do one-a-my
seminars, I’m Superaman! I’m Batman! I’m like a fucking action hero the
way I feel afterwards, like I could walk out this door, down the street,
pick up any fuckin’ pootie I see that has even one second to stop –</p>
<p><strong>gwenovier</strong>: All it takes is one second?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Just one look, one hesitation, one subtle
gesture for me to know – And Bing-Bam-Boom I’m away on a tangent – I get
so fuckin’ amped at these seminars and lemme tell you why: Because I Am
What I Believe. I am what I teach, I do as I say, I live by these rules
as religiously as I preach them: And you wanna know what? I’m gettin’
pussy left, right, up, down, center and sideways.</p>
<p><strong>gwenovier</strong>: I’m gonna start rolling –</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: – go, go, go. I’m givin’ pearls here. And
I’II tell you samethin’ else: I’m not succeding in the bush because I’m
Frank TJ Mackey. If anything, there are women out there that want to
destroy me – it makes it twice as hard for me, I run into some little
muffin, knows who I am, knows my schemes and plans – shit, she’s gonna
wanna fuck around, prove to her friends, say, “Yaddda-yadda-yadda, I saw
that guy, he wasn’t anything, didn’t get me.” So me? I’m runnin’ on full
throttle the whole fuckin’ time. Dodging bullets left and right from
terrorist blonde beauties. But I’II tell you this: The battle of the
bush is being fought and won by Team Mackey. Can I have a cigarette?</p>
<p><strong>gwenovier</strong>: Ok. So, lemme just ask you a couple
questions to start –</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What do you want to know?</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: Make it happen, make it happen and
go,go,go.</p>
<p><strong>cocktail waitress</strong>: Hello. You’re back again,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: yeah, yes, hi, hello.</p>

<p><strong>cocktail waitress</strong>: Diet Coke.</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: I want a shot of tequila too.</p>
<p><strong>cocktail waitress</strong>: – what kind?</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: It doesn’t matter.</p>
<p><strong>julia</strong>: Do you still have to do homework?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Not as much as I used to. Ever since we
started, I haven’t really gone in to school that much because I’ve been
getting more and more auditions –</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I don’t have regular classes anymore.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: What do you do?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: They just let me have my own study-time, my
own reading time in the library.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: That’s pretty cool.</p>
<p><strong>julia</strong>: Do you have an agent, Stanley?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>julia</strong>: You should get one, I’m serious, you could
get a lot of stuff out of this –</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: What do you mean, “like what?” – you could
get endorsments and shit –</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: – Richard.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Bite it, Cynthia. You could get free things
from people that want you to endorse their products.</p>
<p><strong>julia</strong>: Commercials, a sitcom, an MOW or
something.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: What’s MOW?</p>
<p><strong>julia</strong>: Movie Of The Week. I went up for one this
morning with Alan Thicke and Corey Haim –</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Was it a call back?</p>
<p><strong>julia</strong>: No. But I probably will get a call back.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: If we beat the record, you might get a call
back –</p>
<p><strong>julia</strong>: I’ll get it because I’m a good actress,
Richard.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Saucy-saucy.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: C’mon guys, settle down –</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Cynthia?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: How much time do we have?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Not enough, what do you want?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I should maybe go to the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Can you hold it?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Just hold it, you’ll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>julia</strong>: Here they come –</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: They look pretty smart, I think.</p>
<p><strong>julia</strong>: No they don’t –</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: What are they gonna do – beat us?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>julia</strong>: We’re not going out two days before we set
the record, it’s not gonna happen.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: When they want us done, they’ll call in the
Harvard S.W.A.T team or some shit.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You look great.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: What the fuck is this, Jimmy?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: …you know…</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Did your wife find out?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Then what?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: It’s just…too late for me to be fuckin’
around. I gotta stop. I gotta clean my brain of all the shit I’ve done
that I shouldn’t have done –</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: – that you shouldn’t have done? That you
regret, what? This? What’s this? Fuck, man, c’mon. Treat me like an
asshole, but treat me like an asshole.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I don’t wanna have to lie to anyone. I don’t
want to hurt anyone else, anymore.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Thirty fuckin’ years I’ve been with Rose,
don’t – y’know – with this, and I know what you think –</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: All your other fluzzies?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Yeah. Yes.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: You’re making me feel so dirty and shitty. I
feel like a big piece of shit right now.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Are you gonna tell her what you’ve done?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Will you say my name?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: If she asks me any question I want to tell
her. I want to tell her everything I’ve done.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Well can you do me one favor and don’t do
that.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Come and tell me it’s over and I’ll walk
away, Jimmy. I’ve fucked you behind your wife’s back for three years,
and you’ve fucked teenage girls behind mine for the same amount of time
– I’ll walk away, you need something for your life, for your conscience,
but don’t put me in the middle –</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I won’t.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: What happend to you?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I got in trouble at school.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Are you ok?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Fuck no.</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: Ready to run. Paula.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Burt.</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: You smell like trouble –</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I’m fuckin’ hammered, Burt.</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: You ok?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: ooohhhhhh no.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: It’s been the same fuckin’ thing for thirty
years, Burt –</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: These adults are tough enough, I think you’ll
be surprised – the Mexican’s a bit of a question mark –</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: Fuck - fuck - fuck - Jimmy -</p>

I have a situation, a situation just come up that’s really pretty
serious and I’m not sure who I should talk to or what I should do but
could you maybe put me in touch with the right person if I explain

<p><strong>chad</strong>: I’m really only equipped to take orders –</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Well can you connect me to someone else?</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Well what’s the situation?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Well, ok. Lemme see how I explain this without
it seeming kinda crazy, but here go: I’m, my name is Phil Parma and I

<p><strong>chad</strong>: I’m here, I’m listening.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: OK. See: Frank TJ Macky is Earl Partridge’s
son….</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Where are you from originally?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Around here.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: the valley?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Hollywood, mainly.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: And what did your parents do?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: My father worked in televison. My mother –
this is gonna sound silly to you – she was a librarian.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Why does that sound silly?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Well I guess it doesn’t.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Does you mother still work?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: She’s retired.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Are you close?</p>

<p><strong>frank</strong>: Muffy, can I get another ciggy?</p>
<p><strong>young pharmacy kid</strong>: Cats and Dogs out there,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: mmmhmm.</p>
<p><strong>young pharmacy kid</strong>: Must have alot goin’ on for all
that stuff you got back there, eh? You could have quite a party all that
stuff….</p>
<p><strong>young pharmacy kid</strong>: You been on Prozac long?
Dexadrine?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: …I don’t….</p>
<p><strong>young pharamcy kid</strong>: Interesting drugs. Dexadrine’s
basically speed in a pill. Y’know? But I guess a lot of doctors are
balancing out the prozac with the dexadrine, eh? That Liquid Morphine’ll
knock you down, out, around, up and down someone’s not careful…..can’t
mix those up, y’know… …Must have a lot goin’ on in your life for all
that stuff there.</p>
<p><strong>young pharamcy kid</strong>: Strong, strong stuff here,
boy…wow…. What exactly you have wrong, you need this stuff?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: You motherfucker…you motherfucker….</p>
<p><strong>young pharmacy kid</strong>: – what-what-what, ma’am – I
–</p>
<p><strong>older pharmacist</strong>: Please, lady, why don’t you just
calm down –</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: And FUCK YOU TOO. Don’t you call me “lady.” I
come in with these things, I give it over to you, you doubt, you make
your phone calls, check on me, look suspicious, ask questions, “I’m
sick.” I HAVE SICKNESS</p>
<p><strong>what’s wrong? have you seen death in your bed</strong>: IN
YOUR HOUSE? And where is your fucking decency? That I’m asked questions
“WHAT’S WRONG?” You suck my dick, that’s what’s wrong and you, you
fucking call me “lady.” You SHAME ON YOU.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Why don’t they have the same last name? They
don’t have the same last name.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I know – and I can’t really explain that, but
I have a feeling there’s something, some situation between them, like
they don’t really know each other much or well, something like they
don’t talk much anymore –</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Does this sound weird?</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Well I’m not sure why you’re calling me.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: There’s no number for Frank in any of Earl’s
stuff and he’s pretty out of it – I mean, like I said, he’s dying,
y’know. Dying of Cancer.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: What kind of Cancer?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Brain and Lung.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: My mother had breast cancer.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: It’s rough. I’m sorry, did she make it?</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Oh, she’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Oh that’s good.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: It was scary though.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: It’s a helluva disease.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Sure is. So why call me?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I know this all seems silly. I know that maybe
I sound ridiculous, like maybe this is the scene of the movie where the
guy is trying to get ahold of the long-lost son, but this is that scene.
Y’know? I think they have those scenes in movies because they’re true,
because they really happen. And you gotta believe me: This is really
happening. I mean, I can give you my phone number and you can call me
back if you wanna check with whoever you can check this with, but don’t
leave me hanging on this – please – please. See: See: See this is the
scene of the movie where you help me out –</p>
<p><strong>gwenovier</strong>: – see, I thought you grew up here in the
valley –</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Like I said, yeah –</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: And you went to Van Nuys High, right?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I don’t how much I went – but I was enrolled.
I was such a loser back then. I was – misguided, pathetic – I was very
fat. Not even close to what I am today. Not the Frank TJ Mackey you’re
eager to talk to because I was swimming in what was as opposed to I
wanted.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Where does that name come from?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What name? My name?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: It’s not your given name, right?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: My mother’s name, actually. Good question.
You’ve done you’re research.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: And “Frank?”</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: “Frank” was my mother’s father.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Ok. That’s why. I had trouble locating your
school records at Berkely and UCLA. Your name change – they had no
official enrollment –</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Oh, yeah. No, no, no. They wouldn’t –</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: They wouldn’t?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: no, no, no. Certainly not. I wasn’t officialy
enrolled, that’s right. Was that unclear?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Kind of.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I wouldn’t want that to be misunderstood: My
enrollment was totally unoffical because I was, sadly, unable to afford
tuition up there. But there were three wonderful men who were kind
enough to let me sit in on their classes, and they’re names are:
Macready, Horn and Langtree among others. I was completely independent
financially, and like I said: One Sad Sack A Shit. So what we’re looking
at here is a true rags to riches story and I think that’s what most
people respond to in “Seduce,” And At The End Of The Day? Hey – it may
not even be about picking up chicks and sticking your cock in it – it’s
about finding What You Can Be In This World. Defining It. Controling It
and saying: I will take what is mine. You just happen to get a blow job
out of it, then hey-what-the-fuck- why-not? he.he.he.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy gator</strong>: End of Round One! Excellent work ladies
and germs, let’s see the scores on the boards: Kids up a leg with 2025,
Adults down a bit with 1200. We’ll be back for Round Two and a
Ring-Dang-Do –</p>
<p><strong>jimmy gator</strong>: HELLO! Musical Bonus Question before we
go to break and the lucky team is –</p>
<p><strong>jimmy gator</strong>: Kids in the lead and they get a chance
to pull further and farther ahead – with the following secret bonus
musical question: I will read you a line from an opera and you are to
give me the same line in the language in which the opera was originaly
written and for a bonus 25 you can sing it. Here’s the line: “Love is a
rebellious bird that nobody can tame, and it’s all in vain to call it,
if it chooses to refuse.”</p>
<p><strong>stanely</strong>: Well that was..uh..in French…and that was
in the opera, “Carmen.” And that goes…um… L’amour est un oiseau rebelle
Que nul ne peut apprivoiser, Et c’est bien en vain qu’on l’appelle, S’il
lui convient de refuser.</p>
<p><strong>jim kurring</strong>: got some coffee brewing, huh?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Yeah…it’s not…it’s been on for a bit –</p>
<p><strong>jim kurring</strong>: I like iced coffee, generally, but a
day like this, rain and what not, I enjoy a warm cup –</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: – do you wanna cup?</p>
<p><strong>jim kurring</strong>: That’s great, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: I don’t know how fresh it’s gonna be –</p>
<p><strong>jim kurring</strong>: Oh, it’ll be fine, I’m sure,
Claudia.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: You take cream or sugar?</p>
<p><strong>jim kurring</strong>: That’d be fine. So, Claudia, lemme just
say, so I can get my role of LAPD officer out of the way before we enjoy
our coffee I’m not gonna write you up or anything, I’m not gonna give
you a citation here – but the real problem we have is that there are
people around here, people that work from their homes, people tryin’ to
get some work done, and if you’re listenin’ to your music that loud:
They’re incovenienced by that. If you had a job you’d probably
understand, but I see you like listenin’ to your music and that’s fine,
you’re just gonna wanna keep it down at a certain volume, maybe memorize
what number you see on the dial and just always put it to that – If it’s
the middle of the day – that’s what I do – just put it on two and a half
and that’s a good listening level, alright? I see you like listenin’ to
your music loud, but, hey, forget about the neighbors, you end up
damaging your own ears ok?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>jim kurring</strong>: Arlight, then. Cheers.</p>
<p><strong>jim kurring</strong>: Is this boyfriend bothering you?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: I don’t have a boyfriend.</p>
<p><strong>jim kurring</strong>: The gentleman who came to the door
–</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: – is not my boyfriend.</p>
<p><strong>jim kurring</strong>: Many times, in damestic abuse
situations the young lady is afraid to speak, but I have to tell you
that, being a police officer, I’ve seen it happen: Young woman afraid to
speak, next thing you know, I’m gettin’ a call on the radio, I got a 422
–</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: It’s not – what’s a 422?</p>
<p><strong>jim kurring</strong>: It’s where situations like these lead,
Claudia, unless you do something about it early, if and when the police
call and come for help. Now there are certain measures you can take
–</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: It’s not my boyfriend – and it’s not
anything – it’s over. Really. It’s not. He won’t came back.</p>
<p><strong>jim kurring</strong>: I don’t wanna have to come back here in
an hour and find that there’s been another disturbance.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: You won’t. You won’t have to.</p>
<p><strong>jim kurring</strong>: But I wouldn’t mind comin’ back in an
hour just to see your pretty face!</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: I’m gonna run to the bathroom real
quick.</p>
<p><strong>jim kurring</strong>: Okey-doke.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I can’t fuckin’ do this.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Fuck. I think I’m gonna throw up, I think. I
haven’t thrown up since I was twenty years old.</p>
<p><strong>angle, game show set.</strong>: Stanley is trying to flag
down Cynthia, who stands off in the wings, she finally comes over;</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Stanley, what’s the problem?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I have to go to the bathroom, Cynthia.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Jesus Christ, Stanley, you can’t go to the
bathroom now. You have exactly one minute before we’re back on the air,
this is NOT the time to go to the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I’m, I need to go, I’m gonna –</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Why does this kinda shit always happen,
Stanley?</p>
<p><strong>luis</strong>: What’s the problem over there?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Mind yer bussiness –</p>
<p><strong>mim</strong>: Watch your mouth, little man.</p>
<p><strong>julia</strong>: Why don’t you mind your own bussiness?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Alright, stop it, cool down, cool it.
Please. Now: Stanley, you wait until the next commercial break and you
can go then – Just Hold It. Don’t taunt the kids –</p>
<p><strong>luis</strong>: I just asked what was going on –</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Don’t start trouble, Luis.</p>
<p><strong>angle, backstage.</strong>: CAMERA pushes in on Jimmy from
behind as he throws up in a corner. Mary pets his back. He throws up a
lot of BLOOD. She snaps fingers to a stage hand to bring some towles and
a glass of water –</p>
<p><strong>oc voice</strong>: Two minutes, everyone, we’re back in

Frank’s assitant, Janet she’s gonna see what she can do –</p>

<p><strong>chad</strong>: Thank you. Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Ok. Janet you have Phil Parma –</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Hello, Phil.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Hi, hi, thank you for taking my call –</p>
<p><strong>jimmy gator</strong>: I have Cancer, Mary.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy gator</strong>: I have about two months, I have no

a stroke last week –</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: …Jimmy…</p>
<p><strong>floqr director</strong>: Ten Seconds.</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: ….do you know who I am?</p>
<p><strong>thurston</strong>: You’re a friend of the family I
presume?</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: What? What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>thurston</strong>: Nothing special, just a spoke in the
wheel.</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: You talk in rhymes and riddles and
ra…rub-adub — but that doesn’t mean anything to me, see….see…see I used
to be smart….I’m Quiz Kid Donnie Smith. I’m Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from
the tv –</p>
<p><strong>thurston</strong>: Might of been before my time.</p>
<p><strong>patron #1</strong>: I remember you. I remember. In the 60’s
right?</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: I’m Quiz Kid Donnie Smith.</p>
<p><strong>thurston</strong>: …like you said…</p>
<p><strong>patron #1</strong>: Smart Kid! Fuck, yeah, he-he. You got hit
by lightning that one time, right?</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: So what?</p>
<p><strong>patron #1</strong>: I heard about that.</p>
<p><strong>patron #2</strong>: Did it hurt?</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>thurston</strong>: But you’re alright now, so what’s the
what?</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>thurston</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: I used to be smart but now I’m just
stupid.</p>
<p><strong>thurston</strong>: Brad, dear?</p>
<p><strong>thurston</strong>: Who was it that said: “A man of genius has
seldom been ruined but by himself.”</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: – Samuel Johnson.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>thurston</strong>: It was the lovely Samuel Johnson who also
spoke of a fella “Who was not only dull but a cause of dullness in
others.”</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: “The” cause of dullness in others –</p>
<p><strong>thurston</strong>: Picky, picky.</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: – and lemme tell you this: Samuel Johnson
never had his life shit on and taken from him and his money stolen – who
took his life and his money? His parents? His mommy and daddy? Make him
live this life like this – “A man of genius” gets shit on as a child and
that scars and it hurts and have you ever been hit by lighting? It hurts
and it doesn’t happen to everyone, it’s an electrical charge that finds
it’s way across the universe and lands in your body and your head – and
as for “ruined but by himself,” not if his parents take his friggin’
life and his money and tell you to do this and do that and if you don’t?
well, what –</p>
<p><strong>patron #1</strong>: You’re parents took your money you won on
that game show?</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: Yes they did. What does that mean, “spoke in
the wheel?”</p>
<p><strong>thurston</strong>: Things go round ’n round, don’t they?</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: Yes they do, they do, but I’ll make my
dreams come true, you see? I will.</p>
<p><strong>thurston</strong>: This sounds Sad as a Weeping Willow.</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: I used to be smart but now I’m just
stupid.</p>
<p><strong>thurston</strong>: Shall we drink to that?</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: “If a brick weighs one pound plus one half
brick – how much does the brick weigh?” “Well if subtracting the half of
brick from the whole brick you got one half of brick, equals one pound
so therefore the brick equals two pounds –” “A little more than kin and
less than kind,” is Hamlet to Claudius. “The sins of the father laid
upon the children,” is Merchant of Venice but borrowed from Exodus 20:5
and “win her with gifts if she respects not words,” is Two Gentleman
from Verona. Where? Who? How and Why, Kids?</p>
<p><strong>thurston</strong>: “Why don’t you shut the fuck up,” is me to
you, Chapter Right Here, Verse Right Now.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy gator</strong>: KIDS! Are you guys glued to those seats
or what? Are you ever leaving? You’re getting close to the record, do
you get more nervous as we go along?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: A little –</p>
<p><strong>julia</strong>: – yeah….</p>
<p><strong>jimmy gator</strong>: – kids at school must be real excited
for you, eh?</p>
<p><strong>julia</strong>: Oh, yeah…yeah…</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy gator</strong>: Stanley the Man! How are you?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I’m fine. Yes.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy gator</strong>: You’re fast becoming a celebrity. How
are you handling it all?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Ohh, it’s all fine. It’s all. Nice. I’d
just like to keep going….keep getting on….</p>
<p><strong>jimmy gator</strong>: Sure, sure…that’s fine,
then…there…with…..</p>
<p><strong>jimmy gator</strong>: Well you’ve got..many..things, many
things happening and on the way….</p>
<p><strong>angle, burt.</strong>: CAMERA PUSHES IN on Burt as he sees
Jimmy start to zone out a bit.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: What were you saying, Stanley?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I was saying…thinking maybe I’d get my own
quiz show someday, Jimmy. Just like you!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: OK, OK, here we go: Steeper questions, bigger
payoff, individual challenges with musical and audio pockets,
no-steal-lock-out’s, let’s get it on in Round Two, Categories are:</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: – that’s right, that’s right, and what I’M
saying, that none of my competitors can say is this: That there is no
need for insight or understanding. Things of the past! Gone, Over, Done.
Do you realize how fucking miraculous this is? How fucking razor sharp
and cutting edge and ahead of it’s time this concept is? I’m talking
about eliminating insight and understanding as human values. GOD DAMN
I’M GOOD. There is no need for INSIGHT. There is no need for
UNDERSTANDING. I have found a way to take any subjective human
experience – in other words – all the terrible shit or all the great
shit that you’ve had happen to you in your life – and quickly and easily
transform it in the unconscious mind through the subtle and cunning use
of language. The “listener-patient” settles into a very light, very
delicate, conversationally induced state: NOT A TRANCE, mind you, but a
STATE. A state that is brand new. The System’s state. What did I do? I
REALIZED that concept and put it into practical “get my dick hard and
fuck it” use. I’m gonna build a state for the seducer and the seducee to
live, vote, breath, pay takes and party ’till dawn. I’m gonna teach
methods of language that will help anyone get a piece of ass, tit and
tail –</p>
<p><strong>gwenovier</strong>: Let’s talk about –</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I just realized this is for television, isn’t
it? I can’t swear up and down like I just did.</p>
<p><strong>gwenovier</strong>: It’s fine. I can bleep it out.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I warned you – I get on a roll…</p>
<p><strong>gwenovier</strong>: – let’s talk more about your background
–</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Muffy – coffee?</p>
<p><strong>gwenovier</strong>: I’m confused about your past is the
thing.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Is that still lingering?</p>
<p><strong>gwenovier</strong>: – just to clarify –</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: So boring, so useless –</p>
<p><strong>gwenovier</strong>: I would just want to clear some things
up:</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Thank you, Muffy. Funny thing is: This is an
important element of, “Seduce and Destory:” “Facing the past is an
important way in not making progress,” that’s something I tell my men
over and over –</p>
<p><strong>gwenovier</strong>: This isn’t meant –</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: – and I try and teach the students to ask:
What is it in aid of?</p>
<p><strong>gwenovier</strong>: Are you asking me that?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>gwenovier</strong>: Well, just trying to figure out who you
are, and how you might have become –</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: In aid of what?</p>
<p><strong>gwenovier</strong>: I’m saying, Frank, in trying to figure
out who you are –</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: – there’s a lot more important things I’d
like to put myself into –</p>
<p><strong>gwenovier</strong>: It’s all important –</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Not really.</p>
<p><strong>gwenovier</strong>: It’s not like I’m trying to attack you

<p><strong>frank</strong>: This is how you wanna spend the time, then
go, go, go – you’re gonna be surprised at what a waste it is – “The most
useless thing in the world is that which is behind me,” Chapter Three
–</p>
<p><strong>gwenovier</strong>: We talked earlier about your mother. And
we talked about your father and his death. And I don’t want to be
challenging or defeatist here, but I have to ask and I would want to
clarify something – something that I understand –</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’m not sure I hear a question in there?</p>
<p><strong>gwenovier</strong>: Do you remember a Miss Simms?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I know alotta women and I’m sure she
remembers me.</p>
<p><strong>gwenovier</strong>: She does. From when you were a boy.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Mm. Hm.</p>
<p><strong>gwenovier</strong>: She lived in Tarzana.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: An old stomping ground –is this the “attack”
portion of the interview, I figured this was coming sooner or later – Is
“the girl” coming in for the kill?</p>
<p><strong>gwenovier</strong>: No, this is about getting something right
and claryfying one of your answers to an earlier question –</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Go ahead and waste your time.</p>
<p><strong>gwenovier</strong>: I was told that your mother died. That
your mother died when you were young –</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: And that’s what you’ve heard?</p>
<p><strong>gwenovier</strong>: I talked to Miss Simms. Miss Simms was
your caretaker and neighbor after your mother died in 1980.</p>
<p><strong>gwenovier</strong>: In my research I have you listed as the
only son of Earl and Lily Partridge. And what I learned from Mrs. Simms
is that your mother passed away in 1980. See: It’s my understanding that
the information supplied by you and your company and answers to
question’s I’ve asked are incorrect, Frank. And if I’d like to get to
the bottom of who you are and why you are then I think your family
history – you’re accurate family history…well: this seems
important…Frank…?</p>
<p><strong>video camera pov - that moment</strong>: Frank lights his
cigarette. CAMERA zooms into CU.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Are you asking me a question?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Well I guess the question is this: Do you
remember Miss Simms?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Kids, Adults, I’d like you to put yourself at
a picnic. Place yourself there with your family and friends if you’d
like – you’ll hear three musical notes and you are to tell me what it
might represent that you’d find at a picnic – The First Three Notes:</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Well, Jimmy, I know this, I have perfect
pitch, you see – and that would be A-D-E. And that would represent
lemonade.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: For 250. Next notes, please:</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: For 500 and the Third Set Of Notes:</p>
<p><strong>kligman</strong>: You don’t want any water?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: No…I just… I’m so fucked up here Alan, I
don’t know…there’s so much…so many things –</p>
<p><strong>kligman</strong>: Are you on drugs right now?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: If I talk to you…y’know…if I tell you
things…then you’re a lawyer, right? You can’t say things, you can’t tell
anyone, it’s like the privelage, right? Attornery-client, you
understand?</p>
<p><strong>kligman</strong>: Not exactly, Linda. I’m not sure where
you’re going with this –</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Like a shrink, like if I go to see a shrink,
I’m protected, I can say things – fuck – I don’t know what I’m doing
–</p>
<p><strong>kligman</strong>: Linda, you’re safe. Ok. It’s alright.
You’re my friend. You and Earl are my clients and what you need to talk
about won’t leave this room, you have something you have to say –</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: – I have something to tell you. I have to
tell you something. I want to change his will, can I change his will?…I
need to —</p>
<p><strong>kligman</strong>: You can’t change his will. Only Earl can
change his will.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: No, no….no, you see…I never loved him. I
never loved him, Earl. When I started, when I met him, I met him and I
fucked him and I married him because I wanted his money, do you
understand? I’m telling you this now…this I’ve never told anyone…I
didn’t love him. And now….I know I’m in that will, I know, I was there
with him, we were all there together when we made that fucking thing and
all the money I’II get – I don’t want it – Because I love him so much
now…I’ve fallen in love with him now, for real, as he’s dying, and I
look at him and he’s about to go, Alan, he’s dead…he’s moments… I took
care of him through this, Alan. And What Now Then?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Let’s listen:</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: “Hello, Mary. How are you and the seven kids?
As you probably heard by know, we sure gave that Pope a run for his
money –”</p>
<p><strong>mim</strong>: Well: That would be General Robert E. Lee. His
wife Mary Park Custiss. And he did have seven children and he would be
talking about Pope, who he defeated at the Battle of Monasses –</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: C’mon, c’mon, c’mon, snap out of it.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Mim –</p>
<p><strong>mim</strong>: Well that would be Napoleon speaking to
Josephine.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: That’s right!</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I don’t want him to die, I didn’t love him
when we met, and I’ve done so many bad things to him that he doesn’t
know, things I want to confess to him, but now I do: I love him. I love
him so much and I can’t stand – he’s going.</p>
<p><strong>kligman</strong>: What kind of medication are you on right
now, Linda that’s –</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: This is not any fucking medication talking,
this isn’t – I don’t know. I don’t know – Can you give me nothing? You
have power of attorney, can you see him, can you, in this final fucking
moment, go see him and make sure — change the fucking will – I don’t
want any money, I couldn’t live with myself, this thing I’ve done – I’ve
fucking done so many bad things – I fucked around. I fucked around on
him, I fucking cheated on him, Alan. You’re his lawyer, our laywer,
THERE, I’m his wife, we are married. I broke the conract of marriage, I
fucking cheated on him, many times over, I sucked other men’s cocks and
fuck - fuck - fuck - Other Things I’ve Done..</p>
<p><strong>kligman</strong>: Adultery isn’t illegal – it’s not something
that can be used in a court to discredit the will or – Linda. Linda.
Calm down.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>kligman</strong>: You don’t have to change the will, if what
you want to do is get nothing you can renounce the will when it’s
time.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Where will the money go?</p>
<p><strong>kligman</strong>: Well. Considering that there’s no one else
mentioned in the will…we’d have to go to the laws of intestacy, which is
– as if someone died without a will –</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>kligman</strong>: The money would go to Frank. The court
would put the money in the hands of a relative –</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: – that can’t happen. Earl doesn’t want him to
have the money, the things.</p>
<p><strong>kligman</strong>: – unless Frank is specifically ommitted as
a beneficiary that’s what will happen.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: This is so over-the-top and fucked-up I can
hardly stand it.</p>
<p><strong>kligman</strong>: Linda, you just have to take a moment and
breath and one thing at a time –</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Shut the fuck up.</p>
<p><strong>kligman</strong>: I’m trying to help, Linda –</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up.</p>
<p><strong>kligman</strong>: You need to sober up.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Now you must really shut the fuck up, please.
Shut The Fuck Up.</p>
<p><strong>kligman</strong>: Linda –</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I have to go.</p>
<p><strong>kligman</strong>: Let me call you a car, Linda.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Shut the fuck up.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Imagine you are attending a jam session of
classical composers and they have each done an arrangment of the classic
favorite, “Whispering.” Here are three variations on the theme, as three
classic composer’s might have written it – you are to name the composer.
The First:</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Well, Jimmy that sounded to me like Brahms, a
bit like his Hungarian Dance Number Six, I believe.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Excellent. Next number:</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Stanley the Man – answer:</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: …I don’t know the answer…</p>
<p><strong>jimmy gator</strong>: That is not right! That’s not right,
Stanley, the answer is…Ravel….Ravel…. ….xhjksndlsmnop…..</p>
<p><strong>floor director</strong>: What the fuck is wrong with him?
What do you wanna do here, he’s fading fast –</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: I need a better cutaway, go to the black
chick, Camera Three, Camera Three the black chick –</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: Get the technical difficulty card up –</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: Cut it, go to the card, go to the fucking card
–</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Go to the card, now – go –</p>
<p><strong>cu - monitor image.</strong>: The card that reads, “Technical
Difficulty,” comes up and holds.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Ok, ok. I’m back.</p>
<p><strong>jim kurring</strong>: This is, for not a fresh cup, a great
cup of coffee, Claudia –</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: What do you wanna talk about?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Did you piss your fuckin’ pants,
Stanley?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Shut up – shut up –</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: What happend, what’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Don’t tell me to go away, Stanley. I am the
Co-ordinator in this show and you will answer the questions that I ask,
you understand?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: What’s the problem, what’s the problem
here?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I’m fine. nothing.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Why didn’t you answer those questions?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I didn’t know the answer –</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Bullshit. Bullshit. You know the answer to
every goddamn question and I knew the answer to those questions and I’m
not half as smart as you are so What Happened?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: He pissed his pants.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Did you – did you –</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I didn’t I’m fine, I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Stand up.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I said I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: …oh Jesus, what the fuck…?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I’m fine. I’m fine, I just wanna keep
playing –</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Why did you do this?</p>
<p><strong>angle, jimmy. that moment.</strong>: Jimmy is sweating.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I had a stroke, I think I had a stroke.</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: Call 911. Call 911 right now.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: No, no, no. I’m fine. It’s small, I wanna
keep going –</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: no, no, c’mon Jimmy we need to call this quits
and you need to see a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I’m telling you right now, I’m fine. I lost
my goddamn balance and I couldn’t see a moment, but I’m ok.</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: Call 911, Mary, do it right now.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You fuckin’ don’t do that. You don’t do it,
you cocksucker. I’ll fuckin’ kill you with my barehands. Go. get the
fuck fuck – we’re going back and we finish the show –</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: Jimmy you look like you’re about to fuckin’
die right here –</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Shut it. Shut yer fuckin’ mouth.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Are we gonna keep going with this game?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: You’re two fuckin’ days from the record, get
through this and I’II do anything for you, you just gotta get through
this –</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Alright.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: hang in there, ok. I love you.</p>
<p><strong>floor director</strong>: What are we doing?</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: This is fuckin’ stupidity, we’ll get back on
and go through it –</p>
<p><strong>gwenovier</strong>: Frank…Frank…what are we gonna do here?
Are we having a staring contest? Do you have anything to say?</p>
<p><strong>captain muffy</strong>: I think maybe we should rap this up,
Chief –</p>
<p><strong>gwenovier</strong>: I’m not trying to attack you, Frank. I
think that if you have something that needs to be cleared up…Well, then…
I was told that your father, that he left you and your mother and you
were forced to take care of her during her illness…that you took care of
your mother as she struggled with Cancer…. And Miss Simms became your
caretaker after your mother died…Frank…Frank… Frank, can you talk about
your Mother? Frank….can you?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: — yeah, yeah, I get in it in my ear. It’s
TMJ is what it’s called technically.</p>
<p><strong>jim kurring</strong>: What’s that stand for?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Tempural-something-mandibular, thing with
something, I dunno. But it affects my ear, I don’t even know if I have
TMJ exactly but just very tight, like - it’s like a muscle spasm and
it’s just gets so clenched –</p>
<p><strong>jim kurring</strong>: This is my job.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: We were just gettin’ warmed up. We were
just getting started.</p>
<p><strong>jim kurring</strong>: Well if you listen’ to that music too
loud again and that fella returns maybe we’ll share another cup of
coffee –</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: If you’re not here for a 422 –</p>
<p><strong>jim kurring</strong>: No. No. Don’t joke about that. That’s
not funny, Claudia. Please, now.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>jim kurring</strong>: Ok, then. Keep your chin up and your
music down, alright?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Yes. I will. It was nice to meet you
Officer Jim.</p>
<p><strong>jim kurring</strong>: Just Jim.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: yeah, good, ok.</p>
<p><strong>jim kurring</strong>: Bye, bye, Claudia.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Good bye.</p>
<p><strong>jim kurring</strong>: I’m sorry, Claudia.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: What is it? Did you forget something?</p>
<p><strong>jim kurring</strong>: No, no. I was wondering…man oh man. I
think I feel like a bit of a scum-bucket doing this, considering that I
came here as an officer of the law and the situation and all this but I
think I’d be a fool if I didn’t do something I really want to do which
is to ask you on a date.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: You wanna go on a date with me?</p>
<p><strong>jim kurring</strong>: Please, yes.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Well…is that illegal?</p>
<p><strong>jim kurring</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Then…I’d like to go…What do you want to
do?</p>
<p><strong>jim kurring</strong>: I don’t know. I haven’t thought about
it – you know what – that’s not true – I have thought about it. I’ve
thought about going on a date with you since you opened the door.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>jim kurring</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: I thought you were flirting with me a
little.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Do you wanna go tonight? I mean, are you
working?</p>
<p><strong>jim kurring</strong>: No, I’m off tonight. I would lov-like,
to go tonight, I can pick you up, I can pick you up here at about what
time? What time?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Eight o’clock?</p>
<p><strong>jim kurring</strong>: What about ten o’clock, is that too
late? I don’t get off and then –</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Oh sure yes, that’s fine, late dinners are
good. Should I get dressed up or – ?</p>
<p><strong>jim kurring</strong>: No, no, just casual maybe, maybe I
thought – there’s a spot I like to go, it’s real nice that overlooks a
golf course and the course is lit up at night –</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Billingsley’s?</p>
<p><strong>jim kurring</strong>: Yeah, You know it? You know
Billingsley’s?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: It’s my favorite place –</p>
<p><strong>jim kurring</strong>: Oh, see? This is great. Ten
o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Great, bye.</p>
<p><strong>jim kurring</strong>: Bye.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Not true. Not true. And you know what? Even if
you don’t get to pump her, you can still practice honing your skills on
a femenist –</p>
<p><strong>disciple</strong>: – I know –</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: – and you need to do that.</p>
<p><strong>disciple</strong>: I will.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: No, you need to do it.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Doc it’s Janet.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: I have to talk to Frank, is he nearby?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: He’s doing the interview with the lady –</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: I need you to interupt him, I need to get him
on the phone with me right away –</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: What happend?</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Doc, go get Frank and put him on the
phone.</p>
<p><strong>gwenovier</strong>: C’mon, Frank. What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What am I doing?</p>
<p><strong>gwenovier</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’m quietly judging you.</p>
<p><strong>floor director</strong>: And…three…two…one —</p>
<p><strong>jimmy gator</strong>: What a day and what a round, going back
and in for me and the final speed round to determine who’s who today –
scores on the board’s Kids: 9225. Adults: 11,000. And this game is not
out of reach for the Kids…can they hang in there and break the record?
Elders! Who’s the lucky so and so?</p>
<p><strong>mim</strong>: It’s gonna be me, Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: C’mon down here, Mim.</p>
<p><strong>angle, stanley.</strong>: CAMERA pushes in on him and lands
in CU.</p>
<p><strong>angle, jimmy and mim</strong>: They chat about the game so
far, etc. “They’re quite a challenge, etc.”</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I don’t wanna go, I can’t do it this
time.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: – the fuck are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>julia</strong>: You have to go, Stanley. You’re the
smartest.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I don’t wanna do it. Why can’t one of you
do it –</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Stanley if you don’t fuckin’ stand up and
go over there I’m gonna beat your ass –</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I’m sick of being the one, the one who
always has to do everything, I don’t want to be the one always –</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Do I even have to ask? Stanley, get your butt
over here –</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: …I’m sick….I’m sick here now…..</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: I confuse melancholy and depression
sometimes….</p>
<p><strong>thurston</strong>: Mmm.Hmm.</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: You see?</p>
<p><strong>thurston</strong>: Why don’t you run along now friend, your
dessert is getting cold.</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: I’m sick.</p>
<p><strong>thurston</strong>: Stay that way.</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: I’m sick and I’m in love.</p>
<p><strong>thurston</strong>: You seem the sort of person who confuses
the two.</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: That’s right. That’s the first time you’re
right. I CONFUSE THE TWO</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: I love you. I love you and I’m sick. I’II
talk to you….I’ll talk to you tommorrow. I’m getting corrective oral
surgery tomorrow. For my teeth. For my teeth and for you….for you so we
can speak. You have braces. Me too. Me too. I’m getting braces, too. For
you. For you, dear Brad. And I don’t have any money. And I don’t have
any money now but I’II get it…I will for you, Brad. I love you, Brad.
Brad the Bartender. You wanna love me back? Love me back and I’ll be
good to you. I’II be god damn good for you. And I won’t be mad if you
don’t know who said what. I won’t punish you if you get the answer
wrong. I can teach and tell you: Samuel Johnson.</p>
<p><strong>thurston</strong>: Brad, honey, you have a special secret
crush over here I think, don’t take him too lovely – he might get hurt
–</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: You mind your own bussines.</p>
<p><strong>thurston</strong>: Gently, son –</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: Brad, I know you don’t love me now –</p>
<p><strong>thurston</strong>: “It’s a dangerous thing to confuse
chidlren with angels…”</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: – and you wanna know the common element for
the entire group, like he asks…I’ll tell you the answer: I’ll tell you,
’cause I had that question. I had that same question….Carbon. In pencil
led, it’s in the form of graphite and in coal, it’s all mixed up with
other impurities and in the diamond it’s in hard form. “Well…all we were
asking was the common element, Donnie…but thank you for all that
unnecessary knowledge…ahhh, Kids! Full of useless thoughts, eh?” Thank
you. Thank you. And the book says: “We may be through with the past but
the past is not through with us.” And NO IT’S NOT DANGEROUS TO DO
THAT.</p>
<p><strong>overhead angle, looking straight down onto:</strong>: Donnie
bursts in the bathroom and starts to vomit and moan, etc.</p>
<p><strong>jim’s pov</strong>: A young BLACK MALE is standing on the
street, about to jay-walk.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I’m going to pass, Jimmy.</p>

<p><strong>phil</strong>: No I haven’t.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Alright, good, I’d like to keep it that way –
all the security and what not, you understand? This could be a delicate
situation for Frank and the family –</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: What happend?</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Doc, just - don’t, how close are you?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I’m about to get off the elevator –</p>

always answer the questions and I don’t wanna do it anymore –</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: What the fuck is he doing, what’s wrong with
him?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: I have no idea.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: This fuckin’ kid ain’t gettin’ up and we
don’t have a show, live television, ladies and gents –</p>
<p><strong>julia’s mom</strong>: What the hell does he think he’s
doing?</p>
<p><strong>richard’s dad</strong>: Is this a point? is this a game?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Time’s up. Thank you for the interview.</p>
<p><strong>gwenovier</strong>: So you sat it out, that’s what you
did?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You requested my time and I gave it you, you
called me a liar and made accusations. And you say, “If I’d known I
wouldn’t have asked,” then it’s not an attack? Well, I don’t wanna be
the sort of fella who doesn’t keep his word. I gave you my time, Bitch.
So fuck you now.</p>
<p><strong>gwenovier</strong>: You’re hurting a lot of people, Frank
–</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: – fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Frank, there’s a situation on the phone –</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I need a player, Kids….c’mon now. The
indescision of a child, ladies and germs!</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: This isn’t funny. This isn’t “cute.” Jimmy
– Jimmy – we’re not a toy – we’re not dolls, here. This isn’t funny you
see, the way we’re looked at if you think that we’re cute Because What?
What? I’m made to feel like a freak if I answer questions and I’m smart
or I have to go to the bathroom. What Is That? And what is that, Jimmy,
I’m asking? I’m asking what is that, Jimmy? I’m asking you that – ?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Well I’m not sure, Stanley.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: I’m sorry, Frank. I didn’t know what you
would want here, what you would want me to do – I’m – I asked him all
the right questions, he’s his nurse, he’s sitting right there with him
and he’s – I mean, I can hear him in the background – your father –</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Is he at the house?</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: I asked him the exact adress and he gave it –
I know that this must be hard, you having to hear this –</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Don’t give me things, Janet just tell me the
thing, the information –</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: We are not on display. I am not a doll.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I’m sorry, Stanley.</p>

<p><strong>frank</strong>: “How To Fake Like You Are Nice and Caring.”
This is…obviously…quite an important section…I mean, let’s face it…face
the facts…Men Are Shit, right? I mean, that is what they all say. We’ve
all done bad things…bad things that no woman has ever done…that’s what
they say. We As Men are taught to apologize: “I’ve done wrong.” “I’m
sorry.” “My needs as a man made me…” Something, something…bullshit….well
what I would like to say….</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: If you feel, made to feel like you need them,
like – like you can’t live if you’re without them or you need, what?
They’re pussy? They’re love? Fuck that. Self Sufficient, gents. That’s
the truth. What you are – we are – you need them for what? To fucking
make you a piece of snot rag? A puppett? huh? Hear them bitch and moan?
bitch and moan – and we’re taught one thing – go the other way – there
is No Excuse I will give you, I’m not gonna apologize – I’m not gonna
apologize for my NEED my DESIRE…my, the things that I need as a man to
feel comfortable… You understand? You understand? You need to say
something, “my mommy hit me or daddy hit me or didn’t let me play
soccer, so now I make mistakes, cause a that – something, so now I piss
and shit on it and do this.” Bullshit. I’m sorry. ok. yeah. no. fuck.
go. fuck. alright. go make a new mistake. maybe not, I dunno…fuck….</p>

<p><strong>earl</strong>: She’s my love…my life…love of it… In school
when you’re 12 years old. In school, in six grade….and I saw her and I
didn’t go to that school…but we met. And my friend knew her…I would say,
“What’s that girl?” “How’s that Lily?” “Oh, she’s a bad girl…she sleeps

y’know… she was…she had some boyfriends…they liked her y’know…but I
didn’t like that. I couldn’t get over that I wasn’t a man, but she was a
woman. Y’see? Y’see I didn’t make her feel ok about that….I would say,
“How many men you been with?” She told me, I couldn’t take it…take that
I wasn’t a man….because if I hadn’t had sex with women…like as many
women as she had men…then I was weak…a boy…. But I loved her…you
understand? ….well, of course, I wanted to have sex with her…and I did
and we were together….we met…age twelve, but then again…age
seventeen…something, somethin… I didn’t let her forget that I thought
she was a bad…a slut…..a slut I would call her and hit her….I hit her
for what she did…but we married…Lily and me and we married…but I cheated
on her…over and over and over again…because I wanted to be a man and I
couldn’t let her be a woman…a smart, free person who was something…my
mind then, so fuckin’ stupid, so fuckin….jesus christ, what would I
think…did I think….? …for what I’ve done…She’s my wife for thirty eight

<p><strong>phil</strong>: What? Say it again…walking in the car?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: ….getthat on the tv….there…</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: …mistakes like this are not ok… sometimes you
make some, and ok…not sometimes to make other one….know that you should
do better….I loved Lily. I cheated on her. For thirty five years. And I
have this son. And she has cancer. And I’m not there. And he’s forced to
take care of her. He’s fourteen years old to take care of his mother and
watch her die on him. Little Kid. And I’m not there. And She Dies. And I
Live My Life. And I’m Not Fair. Thirty eight years and she has cancer

done but the LOVE was stronger than anything you can think up.</p>

punish…punish her….</p>
<p><strong>earl’s voice</strong>: ….and the punishment for what? What?

things…don’t let anyone tell you that you shouldn’t regret
anything…..don’t do that…don’t…..</p>

guilt of what I’ve done…I don’t want you to think…maybe you knew, I
think that maybe you’ve known… So I hope that I’m not saying this for
me…for me to make myself feel better about what I’ve done…but for making
you not feel like you’re sitting there like a jerk…you’ve been the good
one… You understand…I’m so sorry for all I’ve done wrong…and this is
pathetic…what? “Dying man, confess the sins” something? Is it selfish
for me to say this? To say what I’ve done…I feel better already. I do…do
you hate me?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: …No…I don’t hate you. Do you want talk…do you
really want to talk to me and say things and get things figured out,
Jimmy?</p>

people go out on a date, something. They want to impress people, the
other person…or they’re scared maybe what they say will make the other
person not like them –</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: So you’ve done it –</p>
<p><strong>jim kurring</strong>: Well I don’t go out very much.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>jim kurring</strong>: I’ve never found someone really that I
think I would like to go out with.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: And I bet you say that to all the girls
–</p>
<p><strong>jim kurring</strong>: No, no.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: You wanna make a deal with me?</p>
<p><strong>jim kurring</strong>: ok.</p>

say things….no guts to say the things that they…that are real or
something…</p>

maybe done – before –</p>
<p><strong>jim kurring</strong>: Let’s make a deal.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Ok. I’ll tell you everything and you tell
me everything and maybe we can get through all the piss and shit and
lies that kill other people….</p>

tell you that, this: that I lost my gun and I’m not a good cop…and I’m
looked down at…and I know that….and I’m scared that once you find that
out you might not like me.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Oh my god, Jim. Jim, that was so –</p>
<p><strong>jim kurring</strong>: I’m sorry –</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: That was so great what you just said.</p>
<p><strong>jim kurring</strong>: I haven’t been on a date since I was
married and that was three years ago….and Claudia…whatever you wanna
tell me, whatever you think might scare me, won’t…and I will listen…I
will be a good listener to you if that’s what you want…and you know, you
know…I won’t judge you…. I can do that sometimes, I know, but I won’t…I
can…listen to you and you shouldn’t be scared of scaring me off or
anything that you might think I’ll think or on and on and just say it
and I’ll listen to you….</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: You don’t how fuckin’ stupid I am.</p>
<p><strong>jim kurring</strong>: It’s ok.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: You don’t know how crazy I am.</p>
<p><strong>jim kurring</strong>: It’s ok.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: I’ve got troubles.</p>
<p><strong>jim kurring</strong>: I’ll take everything at face value.
I’ll be a good listener to you.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Ohhhh I started this, didn’t I, didn’t I,
didn’t I, fuck.</p>
<p><strong>jim kurring</strong>: Say what you want and you’ll see –</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Wanna kiss me, Jim?</p>
<p><strong>jim kurring</strong>: Yes I do.</p>
<p><strong>worm</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>worm</strong>: ..sorry…</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: It’s ok.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: …say it, Jimmy…</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Do you know the answer to this?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I’m asking you. I’m asking you if you know why
Clauida will not speak to you….please, Jimmy….tell me.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I think that she thinks I may have molested
her.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: She thinks terrible things that somehow got
in her head…that I might have done something. She said that to me last
time…when it was…ten years ago she walked out the door, “You touched me
wrong…” “I know that.” Some crazy thought in her, in her head…</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Did you ever touch her?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: …No….</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Jimmy, did you touch her?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: …Jimmy…</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I really don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: But you can’t say….</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I don’t know what I’ve done.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Yes you do….you do and you won’t say.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: …I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: What…? …no…no, please…</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: You deserve to die alone for what you’ve
done.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I don’t know what I’ve done.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Yes you do.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Stay here, please don’t leave me, please,
please, if I said I knew would you stay?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I don’t know what I’ve done.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: You should know better.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: ….now that I’ve met you…. Would you object
to never seeing me again?</p>
<p><strong>jim kurring</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Just say no.</p>
<p><strong>jim kurring</strong>: I won’t say, no, wait, Claudia –</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Let me go, leave me, let me go, it’s ok,
please.</p>
<p><strong>jim kurring</strong>: please, what is it, please –</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: just let me walk out, ok?</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: What am I doing? What am I doing? What the
fuck am I doing?</p>
<p><strong>wide angle, that moment</strong>: Donnie’s Buick Regal makes
a u-turn and heads back the direction it came —</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Dad…dad it’s me…it’s Frank… It’s Jack….It’s
Jack….Dad….</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’m here. I’m here now. What do you want? Do
you want anything?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I don’t think, he can’t…</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: …just wait…Dad…you want something…can you

<p><strong>earl</strong>: …..fuck…fuck…fuck…</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: …thismssm….</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Oh, Dad. It’s ok. jesus. ok. it’s ok…I’m here
with you now, please. i’m sorry…it’s ok. alright..ok.</p>
<p><strong>worm</strong>: ….you have it…easy….you know? You have a
father who loves you, huh?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>worm</strong>: You know what it’s like to come home scared,
scared that maybe if you don’t have the money you’re supposed to go out
each day and get that you’re gonna get beaten….by a belt…he hits me with
a belt, Stanley…. I’m supposed to sell those candy bars, and if I don’t,
I come home without the money….</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: ….Why does he do it…?</p>
<p><strong>worm</strong>: Cause he hates me….he hates me so much.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: It’s not right.</p>
<p><strong>worm</strong>: I hate it.</p>
<p><strong>worm</strong>: I’m sorry to put all this on you, Stanley
–</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I have money.</p>
<p><strong>worm</strong>: …what…?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I have money to give you.</p>
<p><strong>worm</strong>: No. No. I have to do this on my own.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I can take you to get money. I don’t need
it…I don’t need it – listen to me: I can let you have money so your
father won’t hit you ever again – you’ll have the money because I don’t
need it.</p>
<p><strong>worm</strong>: Where do you have it?</p>
<p><strong>jim’s pov - that moment - moving</strong>: he sees the parked
Buick Regal and Donnie get out and head for the back door….</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: Fuck.</p>
<p><strong>jim’s pov - moving - through the windhsield.</strong>: The
car starts to turn 180 degrees……as soon as it is headed going back the
opposite direction….</p>
<p><strong>closer angle, push in on the driver’s side window.</strong>:
Jim is scared and sweating…..he looks up, out the driver’s side
window….</p>
<p><strong>jim’s pov - looking straight up.</strong>: It’s dark and
empty sky…..</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: There are frogs falling from the sky.</p>
<p><strong>cu - inside the wall, near the socket.</strong>: Camera moves
in and sees some SPARK and FLASH and FIRE started….</p>
<p><strong>….frogs are falling staight at him/camera and they knock him
down</strong>: AND TO THE CEMENT…..he falls flat on his FACE…</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: You are not what you think you are.</p>
<p><strong>worm</strong>: What is that?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: It’s frogs. It’s raining frogs.</p>
<p><strong>worm</strong>: …fuck you mean, it’s raining frogs?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: It’s raining frogs from the sky.</p>
<p><strong>worm</strong>: ….what the fuck, what the fuck….</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: This happens….this is something that
happens.</p>
<p><strong>worm</strong>: What the fuck is goin’ on, WHAT THE</p>
<p><strong>worm</strong>: Stay quiet…stay quiet, son –</p>
<p><strong>worm</strong>: No, Son…be quiet…be quiet now…</p>
<p><strong>dixon</strong>: C’mon, Dad. We gotta just GET HIS MONEY AND
GO, LET’S GO. Let’s get the money –</p>
<p><strong>worm</strong>: We’re not gonna do that now. We’re not gonna
do that now and that’s over.</p>
<p><strong>worm</strong>: Son, don’t –</p>
<p><strong>worm</strong>: – no.</p>
<p><strong>worm</strong>: Put the gun down, please, boy.</p>
<p><strong>worm</strong>: Son, please, now….</p>
<p><strong>worm</strong>: Please, boy, put it down and it’s ok.</p>
<p><strong>worm</strong>: It’s ok –</p>
<p><strong>dixon</strong>: We gotta get his money so we can get outta
here – we gotta –</p>
<p><strong>worm</strong>: That idea is over now. We’re not gonna do that
now.</p>
<p><strong>worm</strong>: I’m not mad, son, I will not be mad at you and
it’s ok and please put it down and I won’t be mad and I won’t –</p>
<p><strong>dixon</strong>: I - just - thought - that - I - didn’t want -
I - didn’t - I - didn’t -</p>
<p><strong>worm</strong>: It’s ok, boy.</p>
<p><strong>music/kermit the frog</strong>: “It’s not that easy bein’
green… Having to spend each day the color of the leaves…”</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: My teeff…my teeef….</p>
<p><strong>jim kurring</strong>: YOU’RE OK…you’re gonna be ok….</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: And there is the account of the hanging of
three men….and a scuba diver and a suicide…..</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: There are stories of coincidence and
chance and intersections and strange things told and which is which and
who only knows…</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: …and we generally say, “Well if that was
in movie I wouldn’t believe it.”</p>
<p><strong>angle, in the kitchen, moments later</strong>: Phil enters
and answers the phone, “…hello…oh no…yes, yes…” Phil looks to Frank
–</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Are you with us? Linda? Is it Linda?</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Someone’s so and so meet someone else’s so
and so and so on –</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: And it is in the humble opinion of this
narrator that these strange things happen all the time….</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Dad…Dad.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: You have to be nicer to me, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Go to bed.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I think that you have to be nicer to
me.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Go to bed.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: …and so it goes and so it goes and the
book says, “We may be through with the past, but the past is not through
with us.”</p>
<p><strong>marcie</strong>: I killed him. I killed my husband. He hit my
son and he hit my grandson and I hit him. I hit him with the ashtray and
he was knocked out and I killed him, I strangled him. I strangled my
husband to protect my boys. I protected my boys.</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: I know that I did a thtupid thing.
Tho-thtupid…getting brathes…I thought… I thought that he would love me.
…getting brathes, for what… for thumthing I didn’t even…i don’t know
where to put things, y’know?</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: I really do hath love to give, I juth don’t
know where to put it –</p>
<p><strong>jim kurring</strong>: …these security systems can be a real
joke. I mean, a frog falls from the sky and lands on the x-4 box ’round
back and opens all the doors? Triggers a siutation? You don’t know who
could be driving by at any moment, walk in and rob the place – I was you
I’d talk to your boss about a new security system –</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: ….ohh-thur-I-thur-thill….</p>
<p><strong>jim kurring</strong>: You guys make alotta money, huh?</p>
<p><strong>jim kurring</strong>: I got a buddy a mine down at the med.
center, he’d probably do quite a deal on a set of dentures, you’re
interested in that. He’s in training, you know he’s not a dentist yet,
but he’s real good at corrective oral surgery from what I
understand…</p>
<p><strong>jim kurring</strong>: …alot of people think this is just a
job that you go to…..take a lunch hour, the jobs over, something like
that. But…it’s a 24 hour deal…no two ways about it….and what most people
don’t see: Just How Hard It Is To Do The Right Thing. People think if I
make a judgment call that it’s a judgment on them…but that’s not what I
do and that’s not what should be done…I have to take everything and play
it as it lays. Sometimes people need a little help. Sometimes people
need to be forgiven and sometimes they need to go to jail. And that’s a
very tricky thing on my part…making that call…the law is the law and
heck if I’m gonna break it…but you can forgive someone….? Well, that’s
the tough part….What Do We Forgive? Tough part of the job…..tough part
of walking down the street…</p>
