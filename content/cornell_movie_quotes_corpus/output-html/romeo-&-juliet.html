<h1 id="romeo--juliet">romeo-&amp;-juliet</h1>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: A heavy, low-slung, pickup truck traveling
toward the sedan.</p>
<p><strong>wide shot</strong>: Sky, freeway, the cars closing.</p>
<p><strong>tight on</strong>: The sedan.</p>
<p><strong>tight on</strong>: The pickup.</p>
<p><strong>tight on</strong>: The fat face of GREGORY, yelling at the
disappearing sedan.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: A dog of the house of Capulet moves me!</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: A dog of that house shall move me to stand.
I will take the wall of any man or maid of Capulets.</p>
<p><strong>sampson</strong>: That shows thee a weak slave. For the
weakest goes to the wall.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: ’Tis true; and therefore women, being the
weaker vessels, are ever thrust to the wall. Therefore, I will push
Capulet’s men from the wall, and thrust his maids to the wall.</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: The quarrel is between our masters…</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: …and us their men.</p>
<p><strong>follow</strong>: Benvolio as he heads for the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>pick up</strong>: A mother wrangling three little boys out of
a station wagon - the smallest kid carries a toy pistol.</p>
<p><strong>super fast scan track</strong>: Past the mother to - the huge
black sedan pulling up outside the gas station mini-mart.</p>
<p><strong>hold</strong>: The spurred boots move out of frame.</p>
<p><strong>crane up</strong>: The other feet belong to a tough-looking
Latin youth ABRA - and his goateed side-kick PETRUCHIO.</p>
<p><strong>follow</strong>: The girls as they head for their car.</p>
<p><strong>super fast scan track</strong>: Past the girls to:</p>
<p><strong>sampson</strong>: I will show myself a tyrant. When I have
fought with the men I will be civil with the maids, I will cut off their
heads.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: The heads of the maids?</p>
<p><strong>sampson</strong>: Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maiden
heads, take it in what sense thou wilt.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: They must take it in sense that feel
it.</p>
<p>****: I am a pretty piece of flesh! I am a pretty piece of flesh! Me,
they shall feel while I am able to stand; I am a pretty piece of
flesh!</p>
<p><strong>gregory’s p.o.v.</strong>: The car pulls away revealing… Abra
and Petruchio exiting the mini-mart.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Gregory.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Sampson - Their singing abruptly
halts.</p>
<p><strong>sampson</strong>: Here comes of the House of Capulet.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Sampson swallowing hard.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Gregory; eyes locked to the Capulets. With
fake bravado he nudges Sampson.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: Quarrel I will back thee.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Sampson trying to quell his rising
panic.</p>
<p><strong>sampson</strong>: Let us take the law of our sides. Let them
begin.</p>
<p><strong>suddenly</strong>: BANG! Gregory and Sampson jump.</p>
<p><strong>whip pan</strong>: It was the garage attendant slamming the
hood.</p>
<p><strong>follow</strong>: The mother and kids exiting the
mini-mart.</p>
<p><strong>super fast scan track</strong>: To…</p>
<p><strong>sampson</strong>: I will bite my thumb at them; which is a
disgrace to them if they bear it.</p>
<p><strong>e.c.u.</strong>: The rear view mirror; Sampson biting his
thumb.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: A scurry of limbs scrabbling across seats
and reaching for door handles;</p>
<p><strong>abra</strong>: Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?</p>
<p><strong>sampson</strong>: I do bite my thumb, sir.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: The panicked mother in the station wagon.
She motions her children to the floor.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Abra: An hysterical rage; he shrieks:</p>
<p><strong>abra</strong>: Do you bite you thumb at us, sir?</p>
<p><strong>sampson</strong>: Is the law on our side if I say “Ay”?</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: The black cowboy boots, trousers down
around them. The sound of a toilet flushing.</p>
<p><strong>pan to</strong>: The next cubicle, the door opens revealing
Benvolio.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Sampson, still sweating.</p>
<p><strong>sampson</strong>: No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir
- but I do bite my thumb, sir!</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Gregory; a ridiculous inquiry.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: Do you quarrel, sir?</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Abra; a dangerous smile.</p>
<p><strong>abra</strong>: Quarrel sir, no sir.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Sampson; unconvincing bravado…</p>
<p><strong>sampson</strong>: But if you do, sir, I am for you. I serve
as good a man as you.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Abra; a lethal question.</p>
<p><strong>abra</strong>: No better?</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Sampson, trapped.</p>
<p><strong>sampson</strong>: Well sir…</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Inside the station wagon. The mother does
not notice her five year old aiming a toy gun toward the boys.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Gregory’s P.O.V.: Benvolio emerging from the
bathroom - he whispers maniacally.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: Here comes our kinsman. Say better!</p>
<p><strong>extreme close up</strong>: Sampson; he screams:</p>
<p><strong>extreme close up</strong>: Abra demonically roars:</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Benvolio. Terror stricken, he sees the
boys.</p>
<p><strong>distorted out of control close up</strong>: Abra shrieks:</p>
<p><strong>lightning cut</strong>: Four hands reaching for guns.</p>
<p><strong>slam zoom</strong>: To Benvolio - weapon outstretched he
screams:</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: Part, fools! You know not what you do!</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Benvolio. He screams in desperation:</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: Put up your swords!</p>
<p><strong>extreme close up</strong>: The black cowboy boots.</p>
<p><strong>crane up</strong>: To find the dark cold eyes and feline
smile, of the wearer of the boots. His name is TYBALT; a cigarette is
clenched between his teeth and his gun is aimed at Benvolio’s head.</p>
<p><strong>tybalt</strong>: What, art thou drawn amoung these heartless
hinds? Turn thee Benvolio.</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: I do but keep the peace.</p>
<p><strong>tybalt</strong>: Peace? I hate the word As I hate hell, all
Montagues, and…</p>
<p><strong>extreme close up</strong>: Tybalt’s finger squeezing the
trigger…</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Gregory firing - a bullet rips through
Abra’s arm.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Tybalt taking aim.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: The gas tank erupts into an almighty
fireball.</p>
<p><strong>news chopper p.o.v.</strong>: Citizens run in the
streets.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: The powerful 60 year old face of FULGENCIO
CAPULET. Seated next to him is his much younger wife GLORIA.</p>
<p><strong>suddenly</strong>: Windows explode in a tidal wave of glass.
Diners take cover.</p>
<p><strong>capulet</strong>: Give me my long sword!</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: The word MONTAGUE fills the screen.</p>
<p><strong>pull back</strong>: We see the word is the number plate of a
large black limousine.</p>
<p><strong>montague</strong>: What noise is this!</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a
foe!</p>
<p><strong>montague</strong>: Hold me not, let me go!</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: The barrel of Tybalt’s gun enters frame
and presses into Benvolio’s forehead. Tybalt whispers sweetly.</p>
<p><strong>tybalt</strong>: Look upon thy death, Benvolio.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Tybalt’s finger on the trigger. Benvolio
screams a scream of mortal horror.</p>
<p><strong>captain prince</strong>: Rebellious subjects, enemies to
peace, Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: The steely gray eyes of CAPTAIN PRINCE,
chief of the Verona Beach Police Department. He lifts the microphone and
repeats the command.</p>
<p><strong>captain prince</strong>: Throw your mistempered weapons to
the ground!</p>
<p><strong>super wide shot</strong>: A trail of devastation winds up
through grid-locked traffic to the burning supermarket.</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: Two households, both alike in dignity.
In fair Verona, where we lay our</p>
<p><strong>scene</strong>: From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean. From forth the fatal loins
of these two foes A pair of star crossed lovers take their life. Whose
misadventured piteous</p>
<p><strong>overthrows</strong>: Doth with their death bury their parents
strife.</p>
<p><strong>slam into</strong>: A coat of arms that labels a large tower
- the emblem reads; “Verona Beach Police Department: In God We
Trust”.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Captain Prince’s grim features. He eyes
Capulet and Montague.</p>
<p><strong>captain prince</strong>: Three civil brawls, bred of an
airy</p>
<p><strong>word</strong>: By thee, old Capulet, and Montague, Have
thrice disturbed the quiet of our streets.</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: My noble Prince I can…</p>
<p><strong>captain prince</strong>: If ever you disturb our streets
again, Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: O where is Romeo? Saw you him today? Right
glad I am he was not at this fray.</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: Madam, underneath The Grove of</p>
<p><strong>sycamore</strong>: So early walking did I see your son.</p>
<p><strong>montague</strong>: Many a morning hath he there been</p>
<p><strong>seen</strong>: With tears augmenting the fresh morning’s
dew.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Away from light steals home my heavy son
And private in his chamber pens himself, Shuts up his windows, locks
fair daylight out And makes himself an artificial night.</p>
<p><strong>montague</strong>: Westward from this city side.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: The boy, ROMEO. Looking out over the ocean
he sucks on the last of a cigarette and then writes intensely in a small
worn note book.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs;
Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers’ eyes; Being vexed, a sea
nourished with lovers’ tears. What is it else? A madness most discreet,
A choking gall and a preserving sweet.</p>
<p><strong>montague</strong>: Black and portentous must this humour
prove Unless good counsel may the cause remove.</p>
<p><strong>p.o.v.</strong>: From the limousine. Romeo rises and
listlessly makes his way up the beach - seeing his father’s car he turns
and heads for the path that hugs the beach front.</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: So please you step aside. I’ll know his
grievance or be much denied.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Montague, an encouraging smile.</p>
<p><strong>montague</strong>: Come Madam. Let’s away.</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: Good morrow, cousin.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Is the day so young?</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: But new struck, Coz.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Ay me! Sad hours seem long.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Was that my father that went hence so
fast?</p>
<p>****: It was.</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: What sadness lengthens Romeo’s hours?</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Not having that which having makes them
short.</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: In love?</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Out.</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: Of love?</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Out of her favor where I am in love.</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: Alas that love, so gentle in his view,
Should be so tyrannical and rough in proof!</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Alas that love, whose view…</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: What fray was here?</p>
<p>****: Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all. Here’s much to do
with hate, but more with love.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Why then, O brawling love, O loving hate, O
anything, of nothing first create! O heavy lightness, serious vanity,
Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms, Feather of lead, bright smoke,
cold fire, sick health, Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: This love feel I, that feel no love in
this!</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Dost thou not laugh?</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: No, coz, I rather weep.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Farewell, my coz.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: The sleeping face of a fourteen year old
boy -</p>
<p><strong>pull back</strong>: Balthasar sleeps on the hood of a
magnificent silver car.</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: Tell me in sadness, who is it that you
love.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: In sadness, cousin, I do love…a woman.</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: I aimed so near when I supposed you
loved.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: A right good marksman; and she’s fair I
love.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: The tattooed word; ROSALINE.</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: Rosaline! A right fair mark, fair coz, is
soonest hit.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: She’ll not be hit with Cupid’s arrow. She
hath Dian’s wit, And in strong proof of chastity lives well armed.</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: Then she hath sworn that she will still
live chaste?</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: She hath; and in that sparing makes huge
waste.</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: Be ruled by me; forget to think of
her.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: O, teach me how I should forget to think!</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: By giving liberty unto thine eyes. Examine
other beauties.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Farewell. Thou canst not teach me to
forget.</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: I’ll pay that doctrine, or else die in
debt.</p>
<p><strong>capulet</strong>: But Montague is bound as well as I, In
penalty alike;</p>
<p><strong>capulet</strong>: And ’tis not hard, I think, for me so old
as we to keep the peace.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Of honorable reckoning are you both, And pity
’tis you lived at odds so long.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?</p>
<p><strong>capulet</strong>: But saying o’er what I have said</p>
<p><strong>before;</strong>: My child is yet a stranger in the</p>
<p><strong>world;</strong>: Let two more summers wither in their pride,
Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Younger than she are happy mothers made.</p>
<p><strong>capulet</strong>: And too soon marred are those so early
made. Earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she; She is the hopeful lady
of my earth.</p>
<p><strong>capulet</strong>: But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart.
My will to her consent is but a part, And she agreed, within her scope
of</p>
<p><strong>choice</strong>: Lies my consent and fair according voice.
This night I hold an old Accustomed feast.</p>
<p><strong>capulet</strong>: At my poor house, look to behold this
night, Fresh female buds that make dark heaven light. Hear all; all see,
And like her most whose merit most shall be.</p>
<p><strong>capulet</strong>: Come go with me!</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: Take thou some new infection to thy
eye.</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: And the rank poison of the old will
die.</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: Why, Romeo, art thou mad?</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Not mad, but bound more than a madman is;
Shut up in prison, kept without my food,</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Whipped and tormented.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Good day, good fellow.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Now I’ll tell you without asking. The great
Rich Capulet, holds an old accustomed feast;</p>
<p><strong>rich</strong>: A fair Assembly.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I Pray you sir can you read?</p>
<p><strong>rich</strong>: Signor Placentio and his wife and daughters,
Signor Martino, the Lady Widow Of Utruvio and her lovely nieces,
Rosaline and Livia…</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Benvolio, he leans into Romeo.</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: At this same ancient feast of</p>
<p><strong>capulet’s</strong>: Sups the fair Rosaline; whom thou so
loves, With all the admired beauties of Verona. Go thither, and with
unattained eye Compare her face with some that I shall show, And I will
make thee think thy swan a crow.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: One fairer than my love?</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: The all-seeing sun Ne’er saw her match since
first the world begun.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: If you be not of the house of Montagues, Come
and crush a cup of wine!</p>
<p><strong>rich</strong>: Rest you merry!</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Romeo, he considers.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: I’ll go along, no such sight to be shown. But
to rejoice in splendour of mine own.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: A long deserted corridor.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: An echoey Chinoiserie style drawing
room.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: The still, serene, submerged features of a
beautiful young girl. Dark floating hair gently frames the face. Heavy
liquid eyes stare up through the water.</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: Nurse, where’s my daughter? Call her forth
to me.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: I bade her come. God forbid! Where’s this
girl? Juliet!</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: The top of the stairs. As if from nowhere,
Juliet has appeared. She wears a bathrobe and her hair is wet.</p>
<p>****: Madam, I am here. What is you will.</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: Nurse, give leave awhile, we must talk in
secret.</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: Nurse, come back again. I have remembered
me, thou’s hear our counsel.</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: Nurse, thou knowest my daughter’s of a
pretty age.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Thou wast the prettiest babe that e’er I
nursed.</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: By my count, I was your mother much upon
these years That you are now a maid.</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: Thus then in brief, the valiant Paris seeks
you for his love.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Juliet; an uncomprehending stare.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: A man, young lady! Lady, such a</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: As all the world - why, he’s a man of wax.</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: Verona’s summer hath not such a flower.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Nay, he’s a flower; in faith, a very
flower.</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: This night you shall behold him at our
feast; Read o’er the volume of young Paris’ face And find delight writ
there with beauty’s pen. This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
To beautify him only lacks a cover. So shall you share all that he doth
possess, By having him, making yourself no less.</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: Can you like of Paris’ love?</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: I’ll look to like, if looking liking move,
But no more deep will I endart mine eye, Than your consent gives
strength to make it fly.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Madam. The guests are come.</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: We follow thee.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Juliet stares out the windows and across
the water.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Go girl, seek happy nights to happy days.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Juliet’s face.</p>
<p><strong>jump cut</strong>: Aerial shot of Capulet Mansion. We time
lapse from late afternoon to night; fairy lights illuminate, guests
appear, music swells, and a single incandescent flare, explodes pink
against the inky sky.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Romeo: his face glows pink. He is sitting
on the grubby shoreline of Verona Bay dressed as a boy King Arthur, with
fake chain mail and sword.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Music blares from the sound system. A
silver stilettoed foot emerges from the car and plants itself firmly in
the dirt.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: The boys, eyes wide with amazement.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Another stiletto follows the first. Guitar
groans.</p>
<p><strong>pan</strong>: Slowly up a shapely pair of black stockinged
legs, past a hint of garter belt to a black sequined mini-skirt and up
over a muscular dark skinned stomach and tiny sequined bra top, to
discover: the 21 year old male, African American face of MERCUTIO.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: The boys. Recovering from the initial shock,
they laugh and cat-call raucously.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Mercutio. He roughly jams a short black wig
onto his head and yells above the music.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: Strike drum!</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: We’ll on without apology.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: I am not for this ambling. Being but heavy, I
will bear the light.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you
dance.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Not I, believe me. You have dancing shoes
With nimble soles. I have a soul of lead.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: Too great oppression for a tender
thing.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Is love a tender thing? It is too rough, too
rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: If love be rough with you, be rough with
love.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: Prick love for pricking, and you beat love
down.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Under love’s heavy burden do I sink!</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Benvolio, impatiently honking the horn.</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: Every man betake him to his legs!</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: Come, we burn daylight, ho!</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: But ’tis no wit to go.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: Why, may one ask?</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: I dreamt a dream tonight.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: And so did I.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Well, what was yours?</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: That dreamers often lie.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: In bed asleep, while they do dream things
true.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: O, then I see Queen Mab hath been with
you. She is the fairies’ midwife, and she comes In shape no bigger than
an agate</p>
<p><strong>stone</strong>: On the forefinger of an alderman, Drawn with
a team of little atomies Over men’s noses as they lie asleep.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: Her chariot is an empty hazelnut, Her
wagoner a small gray-coated gnat.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: And in this state she gallops night by
night Through lovers’ brains, and then they dream of love;</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: O’er lawyers’ fingers who straight dream
on fees; O’er ladies’ lips, who straight on kisses dream, Which oft the
angry Mab with blisters plagues. Because their breaths with sweetmeats
tainted are.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: Sometime she driveth o’er a soldier’s
neck; And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats. And being thus
frighted, swears a prayer or two And sleeps again.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: This is that very Mab That plaits the
manes of horses in the night And bakes the elf-locks in foul sluttish
hairs</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: This is the hag, when maids lie on their
backs, That presses them and learns them first to bear, Making them
women of good carriage. This is she, this is she…</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Mercutio. He breaks off. There is a
strange stillness amongst the group. Romeo goes to his friend.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace. Thou talkest
of nothing.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: True, I talk of dreams; Which are the
children of an idle brain, Begot of nothing but vain fantasy. Which is
as thin of substance as the air And more inconstant than the wind, who
woos Even now the frozen bosom of the</p>
<p><strong>north</strong>: And, being angered, puffs away from</p>
<p><strong>thence</strong>: Turning his attention to the dew- dropping
south.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Benvolio in the car. The alcohol has caught
up with him and he looks a little queasy.</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: This wind you talk of blows us from</p>
<p><strong>ourselves:</strong>: Supper is done and we shall come too
late.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: I fear, too early, for my mind</p>
<p><strong>misgives</strong>: Some consequence yet hanging in the</p>
<p><strong>stars</strong>: Shall bitterly begin his fearful</p>
<p><strong>date</strong>: With this night’s revels, and expire the term
Of a despised life closed in my breast, By some vile forfeit of untimely
death.</p>
<p><strong>pause</strong>: The water turns golden as fireworks explode
across the bay. Romeo smiles.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: But he that hath the steerage of my</p>
<p><strong>course</strong>: Direct my sail!</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: On, lusty gentlemen!</p>
<p><strong>pull out</strong>: From Romeo’s eyes. He is lying in the
passenger seat of Mercutio’s convertible as it rockets along the
freeway. The camera is directly above Romeo. He stares up at the
fireworks that reflect in the windshield. The car and freeway begin to
rotate and the camera follows. We feel that the car is now travelling
upside-down. The camera sways through a brilliant explosion of fireworks
that fill the screen with a zillion pixilating, colored dots of
fire.</p>
<p><strong>pull out</strong>: To discover the glittering dots of fire
refracting from the sparkling domed roof of the magnificently ornate
Capulet Ballroom. The camera swoops down over bizarrely costumed
revellers cavorting to a driving Latin big band. The camera partners
with a drugged Mercutio and Benvolio who shamelessly caper with each
other in a mock antic adagio.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Romeo gazing blankly at the dance floor.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Mercutio. He sweeps up a thirty-something
sophisticate and twirls her in Romeo’s direction.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: Everyman betake him to his legs!</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: ROMEO’S P.O.V.: Contorted images of costumed
guests eat, drink and laugh in a grotesque collision of Yves Saint
Laurent cocktail party and Bacchanalian romp.</p>
<p><strong>distorted extreme close up</strong>: A seriously intoxicated
Fulgencio Capulet; his puffy red face squeezes against Romeo’s.</p>
<p><strong>capulet</strong>: Ah, I have seen the day that I</p>
<p><strong>could</strong>: Tell a whispering tale in a fair ladies ear.
Such as would please.</p>
<p><strong>capulet</strong>: Come musicians play!</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Juliet, dressed as an angel, on the other
side of the tank. We now realise that the girls’ powder room and the
boys’ bathroom are divided by this watery wonder world.</p>
<p><strong>slow track</strong>: From Romeo’s profile, in through the
water, and…</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Juliet, your mother calls.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Juliet being dragged along by the Nurse. She
glances back toward the mystery boy, but he is gone.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Will you now deny to dance?</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: A man, young lady, such a man.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Romeo in the crowd. Desperate to find the
girl, he roughly shunts aside a reveller dressed as Lucifer, Prince of
Darkness.</p>
<p><strong>hold on</strong>: Lucifer. He removes his mask: it is Tybalt.
He turns to Abra, who’s dressed as a demon.</p>
<p><strong>tybalt</strong>: What, dares the slave come hither to fleer
and scorn at our solemnity? Now by the stock and honor of my</p>
<p><strong>kin</strong>: To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.</p>
<p><strong>capulet</strong>: Why how now kinsman, wherefore storm you
so?</p>
<p><strong>tybalt</strong>: Uncle, this is that villain Romeo. A
Montague, our foe.</p>
<p><strong>capulet</strong>: Young Romeo is it?</p>
<p><strong>tybalt</strong>: ’Tis he.</p>
<p><strong>capulet</strong>: Content thee gentle coz, let him alone. I
would not for the wealth of all this town Here in my house do him
disparagement. Therefore be patient; take no note of him.</p>
<p><strong>tybalt</strong>: I’ll not endure him.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Capulet, exploding with rage.</p>
<p><strong>capulet</strong>: He shall be endured! What, goodman boy! I
say he shall! Go to.</p>
<p><strong>capulet</strong>: You’ll make a mutiny among my guests!</p>
<p><strong>capulet</strong>: What? Cheerly my hearts!</p>
<p><strong>capulet</strong>: You’ll not endure him! Am I the master here
or you? Go to.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Tybalt choking back tears of rage.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Romeo moving through the crowd. For a moment
the crush clears and he spies the Angel on the dance floor.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Romeo whispers:</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Did my heart love till now? Forswear it,
sight. For I ne’er saw true beauty till this night.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Dave slow dancing with Juliet.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Romeo.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Juliet.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: The songstress, her voice soars.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Juliet. Unable to look away from the boy,
she stares over Dave’s shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Romeo. Ignoring the danger, he continues to
move toward the Angel.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Juliet, searching for the boy.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: If I profane with my unworthiest</p>
<p><strong>hand</strong>: This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this. My
lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand To smooth that rough touch with
a tender kiss.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too
much, Which mannerly devotion shows in this. For saints have hands that
pilgrim’s hands do touch, And palm to palm is holy palmers’ kiss.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Have not saints lips, and holy palmers
too?</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in
prayer.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands
do, They pray: grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Saints do not move, though grant for
prayer’s sake.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Then move not while my prayer’s effect I
take.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Thus from my lips, by thine my sin is
purged.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Then have my lips the sin that they have
took.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged!
Give me my sin again.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: You kiss by th’ book.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Madam, your mother craves a word with
you.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Come, let’s away.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: ROMEO’S P.O.V.: The Nurse and Juliet reach
the door, but instead of leaving, they turn and ascend the staircase
that arcs around to the mezzanine level. They join a vexed Gloria
Capulet who clings to a patient Dave Paris.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Romeo. He halts at the foot of the stairs
unsure.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Gloria. Catching Juliet’s interest in the
boy, she indicates to her daughter to ‘COME ALONG’.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Romeo; a dawning realisation.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Is she a Capulet?</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Juliet. She stops and turns back.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Romeo, comprehending the reality of who she
is.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Juliet. The Nurse whispers in her ear.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: His name is Romeo, and a Montague, The only
son of your great enemy.</p>
<p><strong>hold on</strong>: Juliet. Like a cloud passing across the
sun, a dark coldness descends upon her.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Mercutio. He throws himself upon the shell
shocked Romeo.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: Away, begone, the sport is at its
best.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Ay so I fear,</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: The more is my unrest.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Juliet. Manoeuvred by the Nurse up the
stairs, she breaks away and rushes to a tiny, windowed alcove.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Mercutio’s convertible and its noisy
confederacy joining the line of departing limos.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Juliet leaning out of the tower window.
Brilliant sparkles light in her eyes.</p>
<p><strong>push in</strong>: We hear her secret whisper:</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: My only love, sprung from my only hate. Too
early seen unknown, and known too late. Prodigious birth of love it is
to me</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: JULIET’S P.O.V.: In slow motion Romeo,
through the falling curtain of fiery embers.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: That I must love a loathed enemy.</p>
<p><strong>crane down</strong>: The side of the building past revellers
who don’t know when to leave. Standing in the front doorway is someone
else who cannot take their eyes off the departing Romeo. It is Tybalt.
The music darkens as we push through the smoky wind.</p>
<p><strong>tybalt</strong>: I will withdraw. But this intrusion shall,
Now seeming sweet, convert to bitterest gall.</p>
<p><strong>boys</strong>: “I am a pretty piece of flesh, I am a pretty
piece of flesh…”</p>
<p><strong>push in</strong>: On Romeo, he whispers:</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Can I go forward when my heart is here? Turn
back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: Romeo! Cousin Romeo! Romeo!</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: He ran this way. Call, good Mercutio.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: Nay, I’ll conjure too.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: Romeo! Humours! Madman! Passion! Lover! I
conjure thee by Rosaline’s bright eyes, By her high forehead and her
scarlet lip, By her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh. And
the demesnes that there adjacent lie, That in thy likeness thou appear
to us!</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Romeo’s fake chain mail shirt tangled in
the barbed wire at the top of the wall.</p>
<p><strong>pan down</strong>: Romeo, now on the other side of the wall,
pulls up his undershirt and gingerly inspects the cuts inflicted by the
wire.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: He jests at scars that never felt a
wound.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: O Romeo, that she were, O that she</p>
<p><strong>were</strong>: An open-arse and thou a poperin pear!</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Mercutio. He’s brave but not stupid. He
gets back into the car.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: Come, shall we go?</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: A pair of stone cherubs on top of the
retaining wall of a terraced garden. Romeo’s face appears between
them.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: But soft, what light through yonder window
breaks?</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: It is the East, and Juliet is the sun! Arise,
fair sun, and kill the envious moon, Who is already sick and pale
with</p>
<p><strong>grief</strong>: That thou her maid art far more fair than
she. Be not her maid, since she is envious. Her vestal livery is but
sick and green, And none but fools do wear it. Juliet stands on the top
step of the pool stairs. She is directly below Romeo as he whispers.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Cast it off!</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: It is my lady. O, it is my love! O that she
knew she were!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Ay me!</p>
<p>****: She speaks. O, speak again, bright angel!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: O Romeo, Romeo! - Whyfore art thou Romeo?
Deny thy father and refuse thy name. Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn
my love, And I’ll no longer be a Capulet.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Romeo. Incredulous.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at
this?</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: ’Tis but thy name that is my enemy. Thou are
thyself, though not a Montague. What’s Montague? It is not hand nor foot
Nor arm nor face nor any other part Belonging to a man. O, be some other
name! What’s in a name? That which we call a rose By any other word
would smell as sweet. So Romeo would, were he not Romeo called, Retain
that dear perfection which he owes Without that title. Romeo, doff thy
name, And for thy name, which is no part of thee, Take all myself.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: I take thee at thy word! Call me but love,
and I’ll be new baptised. Henceforth I never will be Romeo.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: A security guard. Alerted by the noise he
moves toward the pool area.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Above water, real time: Romeo and Juliet
surface spluttering. Juliet thrashes the water in an attempt to get
distance from her attacker.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: What man art thou that, thus bescreened in
night, So stumblest on my counsel?</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: By a name I know not how to tell thee who I
am: My name, dear saint, is hateful to</p>
<p><strong>myself</strong>: Because it is an enemy to thee. The
ferocious barking of a guard dog arrests the teenagers attention. A
moment, then they slide beneath the water.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: The security guard and dog appearing above
the pool area.</p>
<p><strong>guard’s p.o.v.</strong>: The rippling surface of the
water.</p>
<p><strong>cut to - underwater shot</strong>: Romeo and Juliet
submerged, hair streaming, stare at each other like two beautiful
fish.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: The guard. He can see noisy caterers
cleaning up around the other side of the house. Frowning, he returns the
way he came.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Romeo and Juliet. Gasping for air, they
cautiously surface. A moment - then Juliet, a small smile.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Neither, fair maid, if either thee
dislike.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: How cam’st thou hither, tell me, and
whyfore? The garden walls are high and hard to climb, And the place
death, considering who thou art.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: With love’s light wings did I o’er perch
these walls. For stony limits cannot hold love out, And what love can
do, that dares love attempt. Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to
me.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: If they do see thee, they will murder
thee.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: I have night’s cloak to hide me from their
eyes. And but thou love me, let them find me here. My life were better
ended by their</p>
<p><strong>hate</strong>: Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Thou knowest the mask of night is on my
face, Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek, For that which thou
hast heard me speak tonight. Fain would I dwell on form - fain, fain
deny What I have spoke. But farewell compliment! Dost thou love me?</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: I know thou wilt say ‘Ay’, and I will take
thy word. Yet, if thou swearest, Thou mayst prove false. O gentle Romeo,
If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully. Or if thou think’st I am too
quickly won, I’ll frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay, So thou wilt
woo. But else, not for the world. In truth, fair Montague, I am too
fond, And therefore thou mayst think my ’haviour light. But trust me,
gentleman, I’ll prove more true Than those that have more cunning to be
strange.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Lady, by yonder blessed moon I vow, That tips
with silver all these fruit-tree tops -</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: O, swear not by the moon, th’ inconstant
moon, That monthly changes in her circled orb, Lest that thy love prove
likewise variable.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: What shall I swear by?</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Do not swear at all. Or if thou wilt, swear
by thy gracious self, Which is the god of my idolatry, And I’ll believe
thee.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: If my heart’s dear love -</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,
I have no joy of this contract tonight. It is too rash, too unadvised,
too</p>
<p><strong>sudden;</strong>: Too like the lightning, which doth cease to
be Ere one can say ‘it lightens.’ Sweet, good night. This bud of love,
by summer’s ripening breath, May prove a beauteous flower when next we
meet. Good night, good night. As sweet repose and rest Come to thy heart
as that within my breast.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: What satisfaction canst thou have
tonight?</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Romeo.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: The exchange of thy love’s faithful vow for
mine.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Juliet. She runs joyously to Romeo.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: I gave thee mind before thou didst request
it!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: And yet I would it were to give again.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Wouldst thou withdraw it? For what purpose
love?</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: But to be frank and give it thee again.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Juliet!</p>
<p>****: Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed. If that thy
bent of love be honourable. Thy purpose marriage, send me word tomorrow,
By one that I’ll procure to come to thee, Where and what time thou wilt
perform the rite, And all my fortunes at thy foot I’ll lay And follow
thee my lord throughout the world.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Madam!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: I come, anon - But if thou meanest not well,
I do beseech thee…</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Madam!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: By and by I come! To cease thy strife and
leave me to my grief. Tomorrow will I send.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: So thrive my soul.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Madam!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: A thousand times good night!</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: A thousand times the worse, to want thy
light. Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books; But love
from love, toward school with heavy looks.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Romeo! What o’clock tomorrow Shall I send to
thee?</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: By the hour of nine.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: I will not fail. ’Tis twenty year till then.
Goodnight, goodnight! Parting is such sweet sorrow. That I shall say
goodnight till it be morrow.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy
breast, Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest.</p>
<p><strong>pan down</strong>: As we hear:</p>
<p><strong>father laurence</strong>: O mickle is the powerful grace
that</p>
<p><strong>lies</strong>: In plants, herbs, stones, and their true
qualities.</p>
<p><strong>father laurence</strong>: Within the infant rind of this
weak</p>
<p><strong>flower</strong>: Poison hath residence, and medicine
power.</p>
<p><strong>pull back</strong>: The Priest carefully gathers the sap into
a beaker. We discover that we are in a small tropical greenhouse.</p>
<p><strong>father laurence</strong>: For this, being smelt, with that
part cheers each part; Being tasted, stays all senses with the heart.
The boys follow the Father as he moves out of the greenhouse and into an
adjoining work area. The walls are lined with bottles of herbs and dried
plants and a television flickers in the corner.</p>
<p><strong>father laurence</strong>: For naught so vile on the earth
doth live, But to the earth some special good doth give;</p>
<p><strong>father laurence</strong>: Nor aught so good but, strained
from that fair use, Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: The muted television. A morning news program
shows footage of a murder scene cordoned off with police tape. A
distraught mother is being restrained.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: The priest contemplating the
television.</p>
<p><strong>father laurence</strong>: Two such opposed kings encamp
them</p>
<p><strong>still</strong>: In man as well as herbs: grace and rude will;
And where the worser is predominant, Full soon the canker death eats up
that plant.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Good morrow, father!</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Good morrow, father!</p>
<p><strong>father laurence</strong>: Benedicite! What early tongue so
sweet saluteth me?</p>
<p><strong>father laurence</strong>: Young son, it argues a
distempered</p>
<p><strong>head</strong>: So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed. Or if
not so, then here I hit it right - Our Romeo hath not been in bed
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: The last is true. The sweeter rest was
mine.</p>
<p><strong>father laurence</strong>: God pardon sin! Wast thou with
Rosaline?</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: With Rosaline, my ghostly father? No. I have
forgot that name and that name’s woe.</p>
<p><strong>father laurence</strong>: That’s my good son! But where hast
thou been then?</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: I have been feasting with mine enemy, Where
on a sudden one hath wounded me. That’s by me wounded. Both our</p>
<p><strong>remedies</strong>: Within they help and holy physic lies.</p>
<p><strong>father laurence</strong>: Be plain, good son, and homely in
thy drift. Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Then plainly know my heart’s dear love is
set, On the fair daughter of rich Capulet. We met, we wooed, and made
exchange of vow, I’ll tell thee as we pass. But this I pray, That thou
consent to marry us today.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: The Priest, thunderstruck. The two kids, now
dressed in red altar-boy robes, enter.</p>
<p><strong>altar boys</strong>: Good morrow, Romeo.</p>
<p><strong>father laurence</strong>: Holy Saint Francis! What a change
is here! Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear, So soon foresaken?
Young men’s love then lies Not truly in their hearts, but in their
eyes.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Thou chid’st me oft for loving Rosaline.</p>
<p><strong>father laurence</strong>: For doting, not for loving, pupil
mine.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: I pray thee chide me not. Her I love now Doth
grace for grace and love for love allow. The other did not so.</p>
<p><strong>father laurence</strong>: O, she knew well Thy love did read
by rote, that could not spell.</p>
<p><strong>choir</strong>: How can you just leave me standing Alone in a
world so cold, Maybe I’m just too demanding, Maybe I’m just like my
father, too bold, Maybe you’re just like my mother, She’s never
satisfied. Why do we scream at each other? This is what it sounds like
when doves cry…</p>
<p><strong>push in</strong>: On the Priest; moved, he looks to
Romeo.</p>
<p><strong>father laurence</strong>: But come, young waverer, come, go
with me. In one respect I’ll thy assistant be. For this alliance may so
happy</p>
<p><strong>prove</strong>: To turn your households’ rancor to pure
love.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: O, let us hence! I stand on sudden haste.</p>
<p><strong>father laurence</strong>: Wisely and slow. They stumble that
run fast.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: Where the devil should this Romeo be? Came
he not home tonight?</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: Not to his father’s. I spoke with his
man.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: Why, that same pale hard-hearted wench,
that Rosaline, Torments him so that he will sure run mad.</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: Tybalt hath sent a letter to his father’s
house.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: A challenge, on my life.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Benvolio, unsure.</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: Romeo will answer it?</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: Any man that can write may answer a
letter.</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: Nay, he will answer the letter’s master,
how he dares, being dared.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: Alas, poor Romeo, he is already dead!
Stabbed with a white wench’s black eye,</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: Run through the ear with a love song. And
is he a man to encounter Tybalt?</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: Why, what is Tybalt?</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: More than Prince of Cats, I can tell you.
O, he’s the courageous captain of compliments. The very butcher of a
silk button.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: A duellist, a duellist.</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo!</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: Signor Romeo, Bonjour. There’s a French
salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit fairly last
night.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did
I give you?</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: The slip, sir, the slip. Can you not
conceive?</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Pardon, good Mercutio. My business was great,
and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.</p>
<p>****: A most courteous exposition.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Nay I am the very pink of courtesy.</p>
<p>****: Pink for flower?</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: I will bite thee on the ear for that
jest!</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: Come between us, good Benvolio! My wits
faint.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Switch and spurs, switch and spurs, or I’ll
cry a match.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: Why, is not this better now than groaning
for love?</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: Now art thou sociable.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: Now art thou Romeo. Now art thou…</p>
<p>****: What thou art, by art as well as by nature.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Here’s goodly gear.</p>
<p>****: God ye good e’en fair gentlewoman.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: I desire some confidence with you.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho!</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: She will endite him to some supper?</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: Romeo, will you come to your father’s?
We’ll to dinner thither.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: I will follow you.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: Farewell, ancient lady. Farewell.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Romeo jammed into the corner of the seat.
The Nurse’s face is pressed alarmingly close to his. She speaks in cold
deadly earnest.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: If ye should lead her in a fool’s paradise,
as they say, it were a very gross kind of behavior, as they say. For the
gentlewoman is young; and therefore, if you should deal double with her,
truly it were an ill thing and very weak dealing.</p>
<p><strong>beat</strong>: Romeo chooses his words carefully.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Bid her to come to confession this afternoon,
And there she shall at Friar Laurence’s cell Be shrived and</p>
<p>****: married.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Juliet’s face peering out her bedroom
window.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: O God she comes!</p>
<p><strong>pull back</strong>: JULIET’S P.O.V.: The limousine pulls up
at the front door, the Nurse alights.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: O honey nurse, what news?</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Nurse!</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: I am aweary, give me leave awhile. Fie, how
my bones ache. What a jaunce have I.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: I would thou hadst my bones and I thy
news.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Nay come, I pray thee, speak: good;</p>
<p><strong>good</strong>: Nurse, speak.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Jesu, what haste. Can you not stay awhile?
Can you not see I am out of breath?</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: How art thou out of breath when thou hast
breath To say to me that thou art out of breath! Is the news good or
bad? Answer to that.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Well, you have made a simple choice. You know
not how to choose a man. Romeo? No, not he. Though his face be better
than any man’s, yet his leg excels all men’s and for a hand and a foot
and a body, though they be not to be talked on, yet they are past
compare. He’s not the flower of courtesy, but I’ll warrant him as gentle
as a lamb. Go thy ways, wench, serve God. What, have you dined at
home?</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: No, no. But all this I did know before. What
says he of our marriage? What of that</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Lord how my head aches! What a head have I:
My back -</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: o’ t’other side - ah, my back! Beshrew your
heart for sending me</p>
<p><strong>about</strong>: To catch my death with jauncing up and
down.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: I’faith I am sorry that thou art not well.
Sweet, sweet, sweet Nurse, tell me, what says my love?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Your love says like an honest gentleman, And
a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, And I warrant a virtuous -
Where is your mother?</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Where is my mother? How oddly thou repliest!
‘Your love says, like an honest gentleman, “Where is your mother”’!</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: O God’s lady dear are you so hot? Henceforth
do your messages yourself.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Here’s such a coil! COME WHAT SAYS</p>
<p><strong>pause</strong>: The Nurse considers Juliet.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Have you got leave to go to confession
today?</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: I have.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Then hie you hence to Father Laurence cell.
There stays a husband to make you a wife!</p>
<p><strong>hold on</strong>: Juliet’s ecstatic features.</p>
<p><strong>father laurence</strong>: These violent delights have violent
ends!</p>
<p><strong>pull back</strong>: Father Laurence is preaching
energetically from the pulpit. Hidden from the congregation, Romeo waits
in a small alcove chapel at the side of the altar.</p>
<p><strong>father laurence</strong>: The sweetest honey Is loathsome in
its own deliciousness, Therefore love moderately.</p>
<p><strong>father laurence</strong>: Long love doth so. Too swift
arrives as tardy as too slow. Juliet pushes through the double doors at
the far end of the church.</p>
<p><strong>father laurence</strong>: Here comes the lady.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Good afternoon to my ghostly confessor.</p>
<p>****: Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.</p>
<p><strong>father laurence</strong>: Come, come, and we will make short
work. For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone Till Holy Church
incorporate two in one.</p>
<p><strong>macro close up</strong>: A simple silver ring. Engraved on
the inside of the band are the words ‘I love thee.’</p>
<p><strong>pull back</strong>: Romeo slips the ring onto Juliet’s finger
as the priest executes the formal sacrament of marriage.</p>
<p><strong>crane up</strong>: Through the majestic patterning of stained
glass, and out of the church to find Peter, the chauffeur, cradling a
small camera as he waits nervously beside the limo.</p>
<p><strong>hold</strong>: On Romeo as he watches the big black car speed
away.</p>
<p><strong>fish-eye view</strong>: From the bottom of the ocean;
Mercutio’s distorted features. Gun aimed, he stares intently into the
water.</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: I pray thee, good Mercutio, let’s retire.
The day is hot,</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: The Capels are abroad. And if we meet we
shall not ’scape a brawl.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: Thou art like one of these fellows that,
when he enters the confines of a tavern, claps me his sword upon the
table and says ‘God send me no need of thee!’ and by the operation of
the second cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there is no
need.</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: By my head, here comes the Capulets.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: By my heel, I care not.</p>
<p><strong>tybalt</strong>: Gentlemen, good day. A word with one of
you.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: And but one word with one of us? Couple it
with something. Make it a word and a…</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: …blow.</p>
<p>****: You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, And you will give me
occasion.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Mercutio. He stops, eyeing the hand on the
gun. No one moves.</p>
<p>****: Could you not take some occasion without giving?</p>
<p><strong>tybalt</strong>: Mercutio, thou consortest with Romeo.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: Consort? What, dost thou make us
minstrels? And thou make minstrels of us look to hear nothing but
discords. Here’s my fiddlestick.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: Here’s that shall make you dance. Zounds,
consort!</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Tybalt.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Mercutio. He will not back down. Benvolio
tries to diffuse things.</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: Either withdraw unto some private place.
Or reason coldly of your grievances. Here all eyes gaze on us.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: Men’s eyes were made to look, and let them
gaze. I will not budge for no man’s pleasure, I.</p>
<p><strong>tybalt</strong>: Well sir, here comes my man.</p>
<p><strong>tybalt</strong>: Romeo, the love I bear thee can</p>
<p><strong>afford</strong>: No better term than this:</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Tybalt. He clears his jacket from his side
arm and issues the challenge.</p>
<p><strong>tybalt</strong>: Thou art a villain!</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Mercutio.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Benvolio.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
Doth much excuse the appertaining</p>
<p><strong>rage</strong>: To such a greeting: villain am I none,
Therefore farewell. I see thou knowest me not.</p>
<p><strong>tybalt</strong>: Boy, this shall not excuse the</p>
<p><strong>injuries</strong>: That thou hast done me!</p>
<p>****: Turn and draw.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: I never injured thee, And so, good Capulet,
which name I</p>
<p><strong>tender</strong>: As dearly as mine own…</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: …be satisfied.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: O calm, dishonourable, vile
submission!</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: Tybalt, you ratcatcher,</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: Will you walk?</p>
<p><strong>tybalt</strong>: What wouldst thou have with me?</p>
<p>****: Good King of Cats, nothing but one of your nine lives.</p>
<p><strong>tybalt</strong>: I am for you.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Forbear this outrage, good Mercutio!</p>
<p><strong>abra</strong>: Away Tybalt!</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: Art thou hurt?</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: Ay, ay, a scratch.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: A scratch!</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Courage, man. The hurt cannot be much.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: ’Twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow and you
shall find me a grave man.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: A plague o’ both your houses!</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: Why the devil came you between us? I was
hurt under your arm. Romeo starts to register the panic in Mercutio’s
eyes.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: I thought all for the best.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: A plague o’ both your houses! They have
made worms’ meat of me.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: Your houses!</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: Mercutio is dead!</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Oh sweet Juliet, Thy beauty hath made me
effeminate And in my temper softened valor’s steel!</p>
<p><strong>aerial shot</strong>: The two cars speed along parallel roads
toward Plaza Jesu. Romeo is gaining.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Tybalt’s car negotiating the immense
roundabout at the foot of the statue of Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Romeo’s car firing out of the one way street
and slamming into Tybalt’s car. Tybalt’s car careens out of control up
the stairs of the statue, clips the fountain, flips, and slides upside
down onto the roadway.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Tybalt scrambling from his upturned
vehicle.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Romeo running toward him.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Mercutio’s soul Is but a little way above our
heads,</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Staying for thine to keep him company.</p>
<p><strong>tybalt</strong>: Thou, wretched boy, shalt with him
hence.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Either thou or I, or both, must go with
him.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Either thou or I, or both, must go with
him.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: Why the devil came you between us?</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Patrol cars sliding to a halt.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: The spinning gun slowly falling to
earth.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Tybalt rising from the ground.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Cops leaping from their cars.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: The gun landing in Romeo’s hand. His eyes
full of rage.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Cops levelling their revolvers.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Put up thy weapon.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Real time - Romeo fires three deliberate
shots. Tybalt’s body convulses backwards against the car, hitting it
with a thud, bloodying the shattered windscreen.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: O, I am fortune’s fool!</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: The scaffolding surrounding the Jesus
statue. Part of it’s canvas covering rips away. Scaffold rains down as
the insanely flapping material tries to smash free from it’s
moorings.</p>
<p><strong>balthasar</strong>: Romeo, away be gone! Stand not
amazed!</p>
<p><strong>crane up</strong>: In the distance we see Montague and
Capulet towers. Divided by the statue of Christ, they suffer the storm’s
rage.</p>
<p><strong>the camera</strong>: Falls through heavy rain toward a woman
crouched over the lifeless body of Tybalt.</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: Tybalt!</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: Tybalt, my cousin, O my brother’s child! O,
the blood is spilled of my dear kinsman.</p>
<p><strong>captain prince</strong>: Where are the vile beginners of this
fray?</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: O noble Prince I can discover all The
unlucky manage of this fatal brawl.</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: Prince as thou art true, For blood of ours
shed blood of Montague!</p>
<p><strong>captain prince</strong>: Benvolio, who began this bloody
fray?</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
That slew thy kinsman brave Mercutio.</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: He speaks not true! Affection makes him
false!</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: Romeo, that spoke him fair, could not take
Truce with the unruly spleen of</p>
<p><strong>tybalt</strong>: Deaf to peace!</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: He is a kinsman to the Montague! I beg for
justice which thou Prince must give. Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not
live!</p>
<p><strong>captain prince</strong>: Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio.
Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?</p>
<p><strong>montague</strong>: Not Romeo, Prince, he was Mercutio’s
friend; His fault concludes but what the law should end, The life of
Tybalt.</p>
<p><strong>captain prince</strong>: And for that offence Immediately we
do exile him.</p>
<p><strong>montague</strong>: Noble Prince…?</p>
<p><strong>captain prince</strong>: I will be deaf to pleading and</p>
<p><strong>excuses;</strong>: Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out
abuses. Therefore use none.</p>
<p><strong>captain prince</strong>: Let Romeo hence in haste, Else, when
he is found that hour is his last.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Captain Prince.</p>
<p><strong>captain prince</strong>: Bear hence this body and attend our
will. Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Come gentle night, coming loving black
browed night, Give me my Romeo. And when I shall die, Take him and cut
him out in little stars, And he will make the face of heaven so fine
That all the world will be in love with night, And pay no worship to the
garish sun. O, I have bought the mansion of a</p>
<p><strong>love</strong>: But not possessed it, and though I am sold,
Not yet enjoyed. So tedious is this day As is the night before some
festival To an impatient child that hath new</p>
<p><strong>robes</strong>: And may not wear them.</p>
<p><strong>pull out</strong>: Of the window and CRANE DOWN: Juliet runs
from the room.</p>
<p><strong>track in</strong>: The Nurse’s words are lost in the
storm.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Oh God! Did Romeo’s hand shed Tybalt’s
blood?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: It did, it did! Alas the day, it did!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Oh serpent heart, hid with a flowering face.
Was ever book containing such vile</p>
<p><strong>matter</strong>: So fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell
In such a gorgeous palace!</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: There’s no trust, No faith, no honesty in
men. All perjured, All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers. Shame come
to Romeo.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Blistered be thy tongue For such a wish! He
was not born to shame. Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Will you speak well of him that killed your
cousin?</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name When I, thy
three-hours wife have mangled it? But whyfore, villain, didst thou kill
my cousin? That villain cousin would have killed my husband. All this is
comfort, wherefore weep I then? Some word there was worser than Tybalt’s
death: I would forget it fain - exiled. Tybalt is dead, and Romeo
exiled. To speak that word is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet, all
slain, All dead.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Nurse, I’ll to my wedding bed, And death,
not Romeo, take my maidenhead.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Hie to your chamber. I’ll find</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: To comfort you. I know well where he is. Hark
ye, your Romeo will be here at night.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: O find him, give this ring to my true
knight, And bid him come to take his last farewell.</p>
<p><strong>slam macro zoom</strong>: Into the ring. The screen fills
with the words ‘I love thee’.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Nurse!</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Ah sir! Ah sir! Death’s the end of all.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Speakest thou of Juliet? Where is she? And
how doth she? And what says My concealed lady to our cancelled love?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and
weeps, And then on Romeo cries, and then falls down again.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: As if that name, Shot from the deadly level
of a gun, Did murder her, as that name’s cursed hand murdered her
kinsman!</p>
<p><strong>father laurence</strong>: I thought thy disposition better
tempered! Thy Juliet is alive, There art thou happy. The law that
threatened death becomes thy friend And turns it to exile. There art
thou happy. A pack of blessings light upon thy back.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Here sir, a ring my lady bid me give you.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: How well my comfort is revived by this.</p>
<p><strong>father laurence</strong>: Go, get thee to thy love, as was
decreed. Ascend her chamber. Hence and comfort her. But look thou stay
not till the Watch be set, For then thou canst not pass to Mantua where
thou shalt live till we can find a time To blaze your marriage,
reconcile your friends, Beg pardon of the Prince and call thee back,
With twenty hundred thousand times more joy Than thou wentst forth in
lamentation.</p>
<p><strong>father laurence</strong>: Go hence. Be gone by the break
of</p>
<p><strong>day</strong>: Sojourn in Mantua. Give me thy hand.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Farewell.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Gloria on the upper landing. There is a
strange faraway quality about her as she descends to Dave and
Capulet.</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: She’ll not come down tonight.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: These times of woe afford no times to woo.</p>
<p><strong>capulet</strong>: Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt
dearly.</p>
<p>****: And so did I.</p>
<p><strong>capulet</strong>: Well, we were born to die.</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: I’ll know her mind early tomorrow. Tonight
she’s mewed up to her heaviness.</p>
<p><strong>up</strong>: toward Juliet’s bedroom door.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Juliet’s face. Tears stream onto the
pillow. Without warning a hand lightly touches her cheek. Juliet’s eyes
dart up to discover Romeo standing above her.</p>
<p><strong>capulet</strong>: We’ll keep no great ado - a friend or two.
For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late, It may be thought we held him
carelessly, Being our kinsman if we revel much - But soft what day is
this?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Monday my lord.</p>
<p><strong>capulet</strong>: Well Wednesday is too soon - what say you
to Thursday?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: My lord I…</p>
<p><strong>capulet</strong>: I will make a desperate tender of my
child’s love. I think she will be ruled in all respects by me; Nay,
more, I doubt it not!</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Gloria, her face hardens.</p>
<p><strong>capulet</strong>: But what say you to Thursday?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: My lord I…</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Capulet he eyes Dave intently.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: I would that Thursday were tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>capulet</strong>: A Thursday let it be then!</p>
<p><strong>capulet</strong>: Wife, go you to Juliet ere you go to bed.
Tell her, a Thursday she shall be</p>
<p><strong>married</strong>: To this noble sir!</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: The glasses clink.</p>
<p><strong>crane down</strong>: Toward the sleeping innocence of the
faces.</p>
<p><strong>hold</strong>: A shadow of fear passes across Romeo’s
features.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Romeo. A pair of lips enter frame and find
his neck. It is Juliet. She hugs herself to him.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near
day.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: I must be gone and live, or stay and die.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Yond light is not daylight,</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: I know it, I It is some meteor that the
sun</p>
<p><strong>exhales</strong>: To light thee on thy way to Mantua.
Therefore stay yet. Thou needest not to be gone.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Let me be taken, let me be put to death. I
have more care to stay than will to go. Come, death, and welcome! Juliet
wills it so.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: How is’t, my soul? Let’s talk. It is not
day.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: It is, it is! Hie hence, be gone, away! O,
now be gone! More light and light it grows.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: More light and light: more dark and dark our
woes.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Madam!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Nurse!</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Your lady mother is coming to your
chamber.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Then, window, let day in, and let life
out.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Farewell, farewell. One kiss, and I’ll
descend. Romeo climbs down from the balcony and into the shadows.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: O, think’st thou we shall ever meet
again?</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: I doubt it not;</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: O God, I have an ill-divining soul. Methinks
I see thee, now thou art so low, As one dead in the bottom of a
tomb.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Trust me, love, all these woes shall serve
For sweet discourses in our times to come.</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: Ho daughter! Are you up?</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: Well, well.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Romeo sheltered just below the lip of the
balcony.</p>
<p><strong>follow</strong>: His hand, as it slowly reaches up and
touches Juliet’s fingers hidden behind her back.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Adieu, adieu!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: O Fortune, Fortune! Be fickle, Fortune, Fo
then I hope thou wilt not keep him long But send him back.</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: Thou hast a careful father, child: One who,
to put thee from thy heaviness, Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy That
thou expects not nor I looked not for.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Madam, in happy time. What day is that?</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: Marry, my child, early next Thursday</p>
<p><strong>morn</strong>: The gallant, young, and noble gentleman, Sir
Paris, at Saint Peter’s Church, Shall happily make thee there a joyful
bride.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Juliet. She can barely speak.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Now by Saint Peter’s Church, and Peter too,
He shall not make me there a joyful bride!</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: Here comes your father. Tell him so
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>capulet</strong>: How now, wife? Have you delivered to her
our decree?</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: Ay, sir. But she will none, she gives you
thanks. I would the fool were married to her grave!</p>
<p><strong>capulet</strong>: How? Will she none? Is she not proud? Doth
she not count her blest, Unworthy as she is, that we have</p>
<p><strong>wrought</strong>: So worthy a gentleman to be her bride?</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Not proud you have, but thankful that you
have. Proud can I never be of what I hate.</p>
<p><strong>pause</strong>: Capulet considers his daughter, then -</p>
<p><strong>capulet</strong>: Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no
prouds, But fettle your fine joints ’gainst Thursday next …</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Hear me with patience but to speak a
word…</p>
<p><strong>capulet</strong>: Speak not, reply not, do not answer me!</p>
<p>****: Fie, fie! What are you mad?</p>
<p><strong>capulet</strong>: Hang thee, young baggage! Disobedient
wretch.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: God in heaven bless her! You are to blame, my
lord, to rate her so.</p>
<p><strong>capulet</strong>: Peace, you mumbling fool!</p>
<p><strong>capulet</strong>: I tell thee what - get thee to church a
Thursday Or never after look me in the face. And you be mine, I’ll give
you to my friend. And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets,
Trust to it. Bethink you. I’ll not be forsworn.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Juliet. She huddles, shaking at the top of
the stairs.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: O sweet my mother, cast me not away! Delay
this marriage for a month, a week. Or if you do not, make the bridal</p>
<p><strong>bed</strong>: In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: Talk not to me, for I’ll not speak a word.
Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: O God! - O Nurse, how shall this be
prevented?</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: What sayest thou? Hast thou not a word of
joy? Some comfort, Nurse.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Faith, here it is. I think it best you
married with this Paris. O, he’s a lovely gentleman! I think you are
happy in this second match, For it excels your first; or if it did not,
Your first is dead - or ’twere as good he were As living here and you no
use of him.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Speakest thou from thy heart?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: And from my soul too. Else beshrew them
both.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Amen.</p>
<p>****: What?</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous
much. Go in; and tell my lady I am gone, Having displeased my father, to
Friar Laurence, To make confession and to be absolved.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: This is wisely done.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt’s death…</p>
<p><strong>crane down</strong>: Father Laurence and Dave Paris stand at
the front of the church.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: …Now, sir, her father counts it</p>
<p><strong>dangerous</strong>: That she doth give her sorrow so much
sway, And in his wisdom hastes our</p>
<p><strong>marriage</strong>: To stop the inundation of her tears…</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Happily met, my lady and my wife.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Juliet’s hand concealed beneath her coat -
we can just see the handle of a gun.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: That ‘may be’, must be, love, on Thursday
next.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: What must be, shall be.</p>
<p><strong>father laurence</strong>: That’s a certain text.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Come you to make confession?</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Are you at leisure, holy father, now? Or
shall I come to you at evening mass?</p>
<p><strong>father laurence</strong>: My leisure serves me, pensive
daughter, now. We must entreat the time alone.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: God shield I should disturb devotion! -
Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye;</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Juliet; she stares stonily ahead as Dave
kisses her cheek.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Till then, adieu, and keep this holy kiss.</p>
<p><strong>track with</strong>: Juliet; she runs for the sacristy.</p>
<p><strong>father laurence</strong>: O Juliet, I already know thy
grief.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Tell me not, Father, that thou hearest of
this, Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it.</p>
<p><strong>father laurence</strong>: It strains me past the compass of
my wits.</p>
<p>****: If in thy wisdom thou canst give no</p>
<p><strong>help</strong>: Do thou but call my resolution wise, And with
this I’ll help it presently!</p>
<p><strong>father laurence</strong>: Hold daughter!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Be not so long to speak. I lone to die!</p>
<p><strong>father laurence</strong>: I do spy a kind of hope, Which
craves as desperate an</p>
<p><strong>execution</strong>: As that is desperate which we would
prevent. If, rather than marry Paris, Thou hast the strength of will to
slay thyself, Then it is likely thou wilt</p>
<p><strong>undertake</strong>: A thing like death…</p>
<p><strong>father laurence</strong>: to chide away this shame…</p>
<p><strong>pull back</strong>: The blue liquid fills a tiny glass vial
held by Father Laurence.</p>
<p><strong>father laurence</strong>: No warmth, no breath shall testify
thou livest. Each part, deprived of supple government, Shall stiff and
stark and cold appear, like death. Now when the bridegroom in the</p>
<p><strong>morning</strong>: Comes to rouse thee from thy bed, there art
thou, dead. Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault Where all the
kindred of the Capulets lie. In the meantime, against thou shalt awake,
Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift, And hither shall he come. And
that very Night shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.</p>
<p><strong>father laurence</strong>: Take thou this vial, being then in
bed, And this distilling liquor drink thou off. I’ll send my letters to
thy lord with speed to Mantua.</p>
<p><strong>track</strong>: With the canvas bag. It continues its journey
into the back of an express delivery van.</p>
<p><strong>crane down</strong>: A weathered sign reads - Mantua: Behind
it a vast colony of permanent trailer homes stretches into the
distance.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: The source of the knocking. An express
delivery man, envelope in hand, raps vigorously on the door of an
unremarkable trailer.</p>
<p><strong>topographical shot</strong>: Romeo lies flat on a single bed
in the crampled trailer.</p>
<p><strong>pull out</strong>: From the mirror. The wedding dress is in
fact being held in front of Juliet by two members of the house staff.
Juliet is dressed in her night gown. The Nurse suggests various pairs of
shoes.</p>
<p>****: Ay, these attires are best.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: But, gentle Nurse, I pray thee leave me to
myself tonight.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Why Bride?</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
Which, well thou knowest, is cross and full of sin.</p>
<p>****: What if this mixture do not work at all? Shall I be married
then tomorrow morning?</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: What, are you busy, ho? Need you my
help?</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: No, madam. We have culled such</p>
<p><strong>necessaries</strong>: As are behoveful for our state
tomorrow. So please you, let me now be left alone, And let the Nurse
this night sit up with you.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: For I am sure you have your hands full all
In this so sudden business.</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: Get thee to bed, and rest, for thou hast
need.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Farewell!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: God knows when we shall meet again.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Gloria. A faint perplexity, and then with
an almost warm smile she turns out the light and leaves.</p>
<p><strong>track</strong>: Toward Juliet. The sombre tones of Faur�’s
Requiem seep into our consciousness.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: I have a faint cold fear thrills through my
veins That almost freezes up the heat of life.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Come, vial. Romeo, I drink to thee.</p>
<p><strong>p.o.v.</strong>: We hear snatches of radio calls.</p>
<p><strong>medic one</strong>: Mortal drugs?</p>
<p><strong>medic two</strong>: Of lethal quantity as ’twould render
death.</p>
<p><strong>father laurence</strong>: As the custom is, In all her best
array bear her to church.</p>
<p><strong>undertaker</strong>: She shall be borne to that same ancient
vault Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.</p>
<p><strong>pan down</strong>: From the vaulting glass ceiling of the
Capulet mausoleum.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: The young man. We recognise the distressed
face of Balthasar.</p>
<p><strong>push in</strong>: Balthasar rushes from the Mausoleum.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep
My dreams presage some joyful news at hand…</p>
<p><strong>crane down</strong>: The Express van pulls up at the front
office. The driver alights and goes inside.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: And all this day an unaccustomed</p>
<p><strong>spirit</strong>: Lifts me above the ground with cheerful
thoughts. I dreamt my lady came and found me</p>
<p><strong>dead</strong>: And breathed such life with kisses in my lips
That I revived and was an emperor. Ah me, how sweet is love itself</p>
<p><strong>possessed</strong>: When but love’s shadows are so rich in
joy.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: News from Verona!</p>
<p><strong>crane high</strong>: Romeo sprints across open ground to
intercept Balthasar’s car. We see, but Romeo cannot, the Express van
approaching from the office. The car slews to a halt and Balthasar jumps
out.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: How now, Balthasar?</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Dost thou not bring me letters from the
Priest? How doth my lady? Is my father well? How doth my lady Juliet?
That I ask again, For nothing can be ill if she be well.</p>
<p><strong>balthasar</strong>: Then she is well and nothing can be
ill. Her body sleeps in Capels’ monument, And her immortal part with
angels lives. I saw her laid low in her kindred’s vault.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Is it e’en so?</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: He speaks with bitter determination.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Then I defy you stars.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: I will hence tonight.</p>
<p><strong>balthasar</strong>: Have patience…</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Leave me!</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: The Speed Express messenger. Returning to
his truck, the priest’s undelivered envelope in his hand, the messenger
looks toward the two boys.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: The boys. Balthasar pleads with Romeo.</p>
<p><strong>balthasar</strong>: Your looks are pale and wild and do</p>
<p><strong>import</strong>: Some misadventure.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Tush, thou art deceived. Hast thou no letters
to me from the Priest?</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: No matter - I will hence tonight.</p>
<p><strong>push in</strong>: As he whispers:</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Well Juliet, I will lie with thee
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: The delivery man. He looks to the envelope
in his hand, then gets back into his truck.</p>
<p><strong>crane up</strong>: In the distance the glow of city
lights.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: A bespectacled eye peers through the crack
of a partly open doorway. Below the face, the barrel of a shotgun
protrudes menacingly.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Romeo in the dark, paint peeling
hallway.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Let me have A dram of poison, such soon-
speeding gear As will disperse itself through all the veins That the
life-weary taker may fall dead.</p>
<p><strong>apothecary</strong>: Such mortal drugs I have, but Verona’s
law Is death to any he that utters them.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: The world is not thy friend, nor the world’s
law. Then be not poor, but break it and take this.</p>
<p><strong>apothecary</strong>: My poverty, but not my will
consents.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Romeo.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: I pay thy poverty and not thy will.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Father Laurence. He speaks into the
telephone with concern.</p>
<p><strong>father laurence</strong>: Who bore my letter then to
Romeo?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: I could not sent it - here it is again.</p>
<p><strong>father laurence</strong>: By my brotherhood, unhappy fortune!
The letter was of dear import.</p>
<p>****: Adieu.</p>
<p><strong>father laurence</strong>: Now must I to the monument alone.
Within this hour will fair Juliet awake.</p>
<p><strong>dissolve from</strong>: The clock to…</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: A cat skitters across a stained formica
table.</p>
<p><strong>pull back</strong>: The Apothecary’s apartment is filled with
cats. Dozens of feline eyes glow in the dim room. Romeo stands
nervously. The Apothecary extracts a small chemist’s vial from inside a
‘Statue of Our Lady’ table lamp - he now speaks with cool
professionalism.</p>
<p><strong>apothecary</strong>: Drink it off and if you had the strength
of twenty men it would dispatch you straight.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: There is my gold - worse poison to men’s
souls Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: The cop.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: This is that banished haughty Montague.</p>
<p><strong>tight on</strong>: A rusted brown hood.</p>
<p><strong>crane up</strong>: Red and blue police light approach
fast.</p>
<p><strong>tight on</strong>: A smoking tire as it lays rubber to the
asphalt.</p>
<p><strong>whip pan</strong>: The patrol car is almost upon them when…
in a seemingly suicidal manoeuvre Balthasar throws his car into a
right-angle turn across four lanes of oncoming traffic. Horns blare.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: A skidding, squealing, out of control sedan,
braking to avoid collision.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: A stone angel etched against the night
sky.</p>
<p><strong>pan down</strong>: Romeo pulls a crowbar from the trunk of
the parked car. Police sirens sound in the distance.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Upon thy life, whatever thou</p>
<p><strong>hearest</strong>: Or seest, stand all aloof. Give me the
light -</p>
<p><strong>balthasar</strong>: I do beseech you…</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Do not interrupt me in my course or By heaven
I will tear thee joint by</p>
<p><strong>joint</strong>: And strew this hungry churchyard with thy
limbs!</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: The time and my intents are savage wild, More
fierce and more inexorable far Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.</p>
<p><strong>balthasar</strong>: I will be gone and not trouble ye.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: So shalt thou show me friendship.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Live, and be prosperous; and farewell, good
fellow.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: A crowbar wrenches at ornate glass and
iron doors.</p>
<p><strong>pull back</strong>: The Gothic structure of the mausoleum
rears against the night sky. Romeo frenziedly attacks the gates of the
small side chapel.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death, Thus
I enforce thy rotten jaws to open.</p>
<p><strong>romeo’s p.o.v.</strong>: An endless marble corridor lit by
hundreds of tiny flickering eternal flames.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Romeo. He murmurs:</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: In despite I’ll cram thee with more food.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: A police marksman in the chopper. His
finger squeezes the rifle trigger.</p>
<p><strong>captain prince</strong>: Hold! Hold!</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Stand all aloof!</p>
<p><strong>captain prince</strong>: Romeo, come forth, come forth.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Tempt not a desperate man!</p>
<p><strong>captain prince</strong>: Bring forth these enemies Montague
and Capulet.</p>
<p><strong>father laurence</strong>: Saint Francis be my speed
tonight!</p>
<p><strong>father laurence</strong>: Fear comes upon me. O, much I fear
some ill unthrifty thing.</p>
<p><strong>hold on</strong>: The green glow of the car clock as the
seconds pulse away.</p>
<p><strong>track</strong>: Down the marble corridor lit by the eternal
flames.</p>
<p><strong>discover</strong>: Romeo. He weakly stands at the entrance to
the viewing chapel.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: O my love, my wife, Death, that hath sucked
the honey of thy breath, Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty, Thou art
not conquered. Beauty’s ensign yet Is crimson in thy lips and in thy
cheeks, And death’s pale flag is not advanced there.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Ah, dear Juliet, why art thou yet so fair?
Shall I believe that unsubstantial</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: Is amorous and keeps thee here in</p>
<p><strong>dark</strong>: To be his paramour? For fear of</p>
<p><strong>that</strong>: I still will stay with thee. Here, oh here
Will I set up my everlasting rest And shake the yoke of inauspicious</p>
<p><strong>stars</strong>: From this world-wearied flesh.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Eyes, look your last. Arms, take your last
embrace. And, lips, O you The doors of breath, seal with a righteous
kiss…</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: A dateless bargain to engrossing death.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: O true apothecary, thy drugs are quick.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Oh Romeo, what’s here?</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Drunk all, and left No friendly drop to help
me after. I will kiss thy lips. Haply some poison yet doth hang on</p>
<p><strong>them</strong>: To make me die with a restorative.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Thy lips are warm.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Thus with a kiss I die.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Romeo. O’ my true love Romeo.</p>
<p><strong>track</strong>: Quickly past Captain Prince and the Capulets
taking cover behind a patrol car.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Father Laurence’s P.O.V.: Patrol cars,
lights flashing, surround the mausoleum.</p>
<p><strong>father laurence</strong>: Balthasar?</p>
<p>****: I brought news of Juliet’s death… And then in post came Romeo
from</p>
<p><strong>mantua</strong>: To this same place… to this same
monument.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Father Laurence.</p>
<p><strong>father laurence</strong>: How long hath he been there?</p>
<p><strong>balthasar</strong>: Full half an hour.</p>
<p><strong>father laurence</strong>: Romeo. The lady stirs…</p>
<p><strong>track slow toward</strong>: Juliet: Sobbing uncontrollably
she prises the gun from Romeo’s hand.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: The parents and Captain Prince.</p>
<p><strong>captain prince</strong>: Hold! Go not forth!</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Father Laurence, he screams as he mounts
the mausoleum stairs.</p>
<p><strong>father laurence</strong>: The lady stirs!</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Captain Prince.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: The parents, a look of cold shock.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: The priest - his cry echoes through the
night.</p>
<p><strong>hold</strong>: Music swells; the droplets grow to a torrent,
and a heavy rain begins to fall.</p>
<p><strong>crane down</strong>: From the Jesus. A sea of black umbrellas
stretches back from the steps of Freedom Tower.</p>
<p><strong>captain prince</strong>: See what a scourge is laid upon your
hate, That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love; And I, for
winking at your discords too, Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are
punished.</p>
<p><strong>aerial shot</strong>: The rain falls. Two black cars lead the
people of Verona Beach in a sorrowful parade.</p>
<p><strong>pull out</strong>: A TV anchor woman watches the image on a
studio monitor.</p>
<p><strong>anchor woman</strong>: A glooming peace this morning with it
brings: The sun for sorrow will not show his head. Go hence, to have
more talk of these sad things. Some shall be pardoned, and some
punished, For never was a story of more woe Than this of Juliet and her
Romeo.</p>
