<h1 id="basic">basic</h1>
<p><strong>over black:</strong>: The sound of HELICOPTER ROTORS slicing
through the air.</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: Jesus, God. . .</p>
<p><strong>fade in on:</strong>: An ARMY HELICOPTER as it soars over the
thick LOUISIANA BAYOU. Lush and green only a day ago, the foliage below
has been ripped to shreds. The kind of damage that can only be done by
nature.</p>
<p><strong>int. army helicopter – sunrise</strong>: Sitting next to the
PILOT is COLONEL WILLIAM STYLES. Mid- 40’s, normally gruff, but
completely cowed by the damage below. The PILOT, unfazed.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Hurricane Beth, huh? Had an ex-wife named
Beth, this is pretty much par for the course. This area got the worst of
it, I hope these guys are all intact-</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: That’s enough, Lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>int. army helicopter – sunrise</strong>: The Pilot pushes his
stick forward, descending to tree level.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Coming up on the pick-up.</p>
<p><strong>ext. clearing – dawn</strong>: TWO MEN emerge from the
underbrush at a run. The BIGGER MAN carrying the wounded SMALLER MAN
over his shoulder. Both in ragged army cadet fatigues - ripped, muddy,
and bloody. The Bigger Man lowers the Smaller Man to the ground and
unshoulders his M-16. Face panicked. The sound of the HELICOPTER
approaching…</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Holy shit, that’s live fire!</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: Who’s shooting at them-</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: I can’t see-</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: That was one of their own, he just Shot one
of their own men-</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Who was trying to shoot them-</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: Get us on the ground!</p>
<p><strong>bigger man</strong>: Are you ready for this?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Tell the truth, Vic. You made these with a
blender, right?</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Don’t like ’em, don’t eat ’em, don’t make
no damn difference to me.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: You know that was like a quadruple
negative?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Can I at least have a drink?</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: It’s ten thirty in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Yeah, if you’ve slept.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: You know the law - no liquor before noon.
Could lose my license.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Don’t you mean “don’t need no liquor license
not taken away from me”?</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Hurricane kept you up, too?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Yeah, and I could’ve used the sleep. I’m
supposed to meet people here tonight, try and get some work going.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: …is expected to announce the grand jury
indictments in the Guissepe Torres police corruption case as early as
tomorrow afternoon. Speculations abound that up to ten former homicide
detectives could be named in the proceedings-</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Bill Styles…</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Old friend. Haven’t talked to him in- 911.
Can I use your phone?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Hey, Bill, it’s Tom. Long time no. . . whoa,
whoa, slow down. Yeah… yeah, of course I’ll come. An hour.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: I gotta go out to McKinley.</p>
<p><strong>ext. fort mckinley – morning</strong>: Establishing. A
sprawling five square mile compound nestled in the Louisiana backwoods.
Also damaged by the Hurricane. HELICOPTERS loaded with emergency
supplies land and take off, REPAIR CREWS work feverishly on damaged
buildings, all while CADET PLATOONS complete morning drills around them.
This is still a boot camp after all.</p>
<p><strong>ext. fort mckinley – main gate – morning</strong>: Styles
stands waiting nervously just beyond the CHECKPOINT with WARRANT OFFICER
JULIA OSBORNE - early 30’s, attractive, close cropped hair and icy eyes.
In the middle of protesting.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: This is totally unnecessary-</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: He asked to see a policeman, we’re getting
him a policeman .</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: But this guy you called, he’s not even
Army-</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: He’s former Army and the best I’ve ever seen
in a room. Besides, he knows the territory, we did Basic together here.
You’ve had three hours with Dunbar and haven’t gotten a peep, we need to
take a different tack.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: He’s not Army, it’s not official-</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: Then it’s unofficial.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Doesn’t get any unofficialer than that…</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: How are you?</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: Been better. I read about what’s been
happening With you… I should have called-</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: What kind of trouble are you in?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: That bad?</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: Would I have called you if it wasn’t? If
there was any other way-</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Tell me what I can do.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: You can get us some answers.</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: This is Warrant Officer Julia Osborne, The
closest thing we have to an in- House investigator.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: And here you are going out of house. How’s
that make you feel, Jules?</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Hostile and uncooperative.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Fantastic. You want to tell me what’s going
on?</p>
<p><strong>int. fort mckinley – corridors morning</strong>: Hardy
follows Styles and Osborne. They pass SOLDIERS replacing broken windows
and sweeping up glass.</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: The official term for it is “Clusterfuck” .
By the time Beth hit us, I’d canceled all off base exercises save one -
a six man cadet team and their Drill out in the bush. We’re missing
three and the Sergeant. The cadets are in their eighth week of the
cycle, nobody here knows much about them, up to and including their
names. But the Sergeant…</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: It’s not West, is it? Tell me it’s not
West.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Ah, Christ</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: You knew Sergeant West?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: He was our Drill here. Man’s older than
sand.</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: A few years ago, the Army picked our good
buddy as their go to non-com to trot out to the press to talk about the
kinder, gentler military. He even did the standard video greeting played
to all incoming Basic cadets across the country.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Well, he’s a good soldier.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: I didn’t mean that as a compliment.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Sergeant West’s served for twenty- Three
years. He’s the public face of the modern Army.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: And you notice I’m not in the Army
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: The exercise was one of his Section Eight
“private sessions”. Left around 2100 yesterday and were scheduled for
pick up at 0630 this morning.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: And the problem is you only got three.</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: No, the problem is one’s dead, one’s got a
bullet in his arm, and one won’t talk. The one who won’t talk was
trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: I’m assuming that’s what made him the dead
one?</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: Cadet Roberto R. Nunez. Killed right in
front of me.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Search parties for the others are fanning
out in a ten click radius from the pickup. If they’re hurt and we can
get to them in time…</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: I called the JAG Corps, the two cadets we
retrieved are to be flown to D.C. On a transport leaving here at
1700-</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Which gives us about five hours. Why’d you
call me?</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: The guy in interrogation said he’d only talk
to a cop.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: And I’m the closest thing to it, right?</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: Tom, bottom line: I let those kids go out
there. If JAG shows up and I don’t have any answers for them, my career
is finished-</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: I’m not gonna let that happen.</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: Thank you. Osborne will brief you on the
cadets. And Tom? It really is good to see you.</p>
<p><strong>int. fort mckinley – osborne’s office – morning</strong>:
Osborne and Hardy enter, stepping over broken glass and hurricane
debris. Hardy looks around.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Gotta be honest, I love what you’ve Done with
the place-</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: You and the Colonel go back.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: He got me through Basic and a lot of other
stuff. I owe him.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: You’re the Tom Hardy I’ve been reading
about in the papers, right? New Orleans PD fired you for taking bribes
from Guissepe Torres.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: It was for suspicion of bribery, it’s really
all in the wording-</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Wording and your friendship with the
Colonel aside, I’m not comfortable having you involved in this.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Subtlety really isn’t one of you finer
points, is it, Osborne?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Three things. First - You don’t have a
choice. Second- I’ve never taken a bribe in my life. And Third - I’m
still a little drunk from last night, so if I skip over the witty banter
and move forward to straight hitting on you, try not to take offense.
Tell me about the two guys.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Hurricane knocked out our Mainframe, so all
we have are their dogtags. Cadets Raymond Dunbar and Levi Kendall-</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Levi? Who names their kid Levi-</p>
<p><strong>osb0rne</strong>: Senator Jonathan Kendall, of Ohio.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Christ… Remind me to thank Bill for
mentioning that on the phone-</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Kendall Junior is still in surgery, so he
won’t be available to answer for his name or anything else for another
hour - the cadet we’re talking to first is Dunbar.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: He’s in interrogation?</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Move him.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Because interrogation rooms look suspiciously
like interrogation rooms, which doesn’t exactly put people at ease. Is
he cute?</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Is Dunbar cute?</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: That is the most unprofessional-</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Is he handsome, self assured, carry himself
well, does he look you in the eyes or down at the floor, does he have
good bones, suggesting good breeding, does he slouch or sit up straight
- these are important questions, as they reveal a great deal about this
man’s character so please get over yourself for two and a half seconds
and tell me is he cute?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Thank you. At some point in there I’m gonna
rub my nose. When I do, go at him with everything you got.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Good cop/bad cop?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Something like that.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Oh, and Osborne? You have any donuts around
here?</p>
<p><strong>int. fort mckinley – corridor – morning</strong>: As two
M.P.’s escort RAYMOND DUNBAR into</p>
<p><strong>int. coffee room – morning</strong>: A small cluttered room
with the shades drawn. A folding table has been set up in the middle of
it with a chair on each side. Dunbar takes a seat in the far chair.
Takes in his surroundings as the MP’s leave, locking the door.</p>
<p><strong>int. fort mckinley – corridor - morning</strong>: Hardy and
Osborne head towards the Coffee Room.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: I questioned him for three hours and he
didn’t make a sound. You don’t have a badge, he won’t talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>hardy,</strong>: Ten bucks says I have him talking in under
three minutes.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Go.</p>
<p><strong>int. coffee room – morning</strong>: Dunbar looks up as they
enter. Hardy smiles, cheerily.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Cadet Dunbar, good morning! I’m Tom Hardy and
I believe you’ve already met Officer Osborne. I understand you had a
rough time of it last night?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Not talking, huh? You probably just want to
get some food and some sleep. They feed you yet?</p>
<p><strong>donut.</strong>: Dunbar eyes it, wary but definitely wanting
it.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Go on. You can eat in front of someone and
still not talk to them - my parents did it for years.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Want another one?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Maybe later. Ray, let me say this up front -
I’m not a cop.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: I used to be, but that’s beside the point.
Who I am doesn’t really matter; what matters is that right now, you’re
in a shitload of trouble. You understand that, right?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Now, I don’t know if you did what you did in
self defense and frankly I don’t really care. I’m just doing a favor for
Colonel Styles because he wants to know if anyone else who’s still out
there is in need of assistance. To be honest with you, though, I don’t
care about that either.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: I don’t know those guys, you do. They die, to
me, it’s like seeing a couple people died in a fire on the news -
tragic, but it doesn’t affect me. The only thing I care about is I
agreed to do a favor for a friend and try and talk to you till your
transpo shows up. You like baseball?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: I could talk baseball for days. Batting
averages, ERA’s, I got statistics in my brain, I don’t know how I
remember them. It’s freaky. You wanna talk baseball?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Come on Ray, we’re gonna be here five hours,
we gotta talk about something. So who do you like?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: I don’t like baseball.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: I asked for a policeman.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: You’re under military arrest, it’s not gonna
happen. What’s wrong with baseball?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: It’s… too slow.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Well, it’s a game of anticipation, that’s the
beauty.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: I just don’t like it.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: What do you like then?</p>
<p><strong>int. styles’ office – morning</strong>: Styles and an M.P.
listening to the Coffee Room conversation. DUNBAR’S VOICE, over the
speaker:</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: I don’t know… I like the Army.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: C’mon, Ray, everyone hates the Army during
Basic. I’ll tell you straight, I hated it here.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: You did Basic here?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Fifteen years ago under Sergeant West. Piece
of work, that guy. I remember, he used to have these two silver .45’s
with ivory handles and if you weren’t quick enough, he’d</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: knock you on the head with one of them. He
still carry those guns?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: I was also his ” knife dummy” . See, West
used to say he could slit a man from stem to sternum in three seconds.
He’d use this length of pipe to demonstrate and if you were the knife
dummy, you’d spend all day getting a pipe rammed into your balls if you
weren’t fast enough to defend yourself. That was a loooong day.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Incidentally, Ray, I promised them I’d ask
where West and the others are. Can we get to them?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: There’s no need…</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: They’re dead, aren’t they?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>int. styles’ office – morning</strong>: Styles lowers his
head at this.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: You kill them?</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: The Colonel saw you shoot Nunez, You’re a
murderer-</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: See, Ray, this is what we call “good cop, bad
cop”.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: She shouts, I stand up for you, you’re
grateful, a bond of trust is established.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: But I don’t want to play games. That’s why
you’re not in an interrogation room, with one of those two way mirrors -
everyone knows those things are two way, right?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Right. Now, I’m gonna go get you another
donut and you think about whether you want to talk more, okay?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>int. fort mckinley – corridor – morning</strong>: Osborne
follows him out into the hall where Styles waits.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Baseball?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Believe somebody owes me ten dollars-</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: You made me look like an idiot-</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Oh, I’m sorry, I didn’t know the object of
the interrogation is to make you look good- Everyone knows good cop, bad
cop - by admitting it I appeared trustworthy.</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: You think he did it?</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: No-</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Yes-</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: You’ve got four hours and forty-five minutes
to find out.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Why’d you ask for a cop, Ray?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: I’m not telling you what happened.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Okay… but I would like to know about the
other cadets. What they were like - nice guys? Dunbar takes a deep
breath.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Some.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Tell me about them.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: First day was when I met Pike. Sarge hated
him from the beginning.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: You motherfuckers have just made the worst
mistake of your lives! You have chosen to join my Army! This Army is my
mother, my father, and my little virgin sister and I will not allow
anyone or anything that is not up to my standards near her pretty little
virgin cooze, do you understand me - give me a sir, yes, sir!</p>
<p><strong>the cadets</strong>: Sir, yes, sir!</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Those who I deem unworthy to pass through this
camp will quit, and those who refuse to quit I will kill. You ever hear
of a training accident - Give me a sir, yes, sir!</p>
<p><strong>the cadets</strong>: Sir, yes, sir!</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: In my time I have killed sixteen men for the
good of my country, sixteen men whose entrance into this Army I could
not condone, as it would weaken the fabric of this nation’s defense!
This base suffers an average of three training accidents a year,
unfortunate incidents that I will not hesitate to repeat if you cross
me, understand - Give me a sir, yes, sir!</p>
<p><strong>the cadets</strong>: Sir, yes, sir!</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: So forget what you’ve seen on Sixty fucking
Minutes about the kinder, gentler military - you will either succeed,
quit, or die by my hand!</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: My power here is absolute, isn’t that right,
nigger?</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Sir, yes, sir!</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: I hail from Biloxi, Mississippi where we
string greasy coon necks up from tree branches when the mood strikes us
you have a problem with that?</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Sir, no, sir!</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: What the fuck is this? You lay a hand on me
while I’m trying to do my duty and rid the world of you?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Get the fuck up, you’re still in formation,
get the fuck up!</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: What the fuck have you done to that uniform,
take it off, take it off, take it off!</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Get those fucking pants off, I want you buck
ass naked, you don’t deserve to wear these beautiful United States Army
issue clothes!</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Cadet, what’s your name!</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Sir, Dunbar, sir!</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Sir, yes, sir!</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Dunbar you are to stand here and guard this
nigger for the next twenty- four hours! He is not to be given food,
water, or clothes! If he so much as moves, you are to blow his nigger
brains out, is that clear?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Sir, yes, sir!</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: The rest of you, fallout for physicals!</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Fifteen guys quit that day. But not
Pike.</p>
<p><strong>ext. obstacle course – eight weeks ago – morning</strong>:
The CADETS, navigating a log spanned over a PIT OF MUD.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Time went on and the Sarge started singling
people out.</p>
<p><strong>ext. tarmac – eight weeks ago – afternoon</strong>: Anderson
stands naked, his arms straining to hold up,TWO PAINT CANS perpendicular
to his body as West berates him.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: He’d zero in on a fella and ride him till he
quit.</p>
<p><strong>ext. main gate – eight weeks ago – night</strong>: Anderson,
now in civilian clothes, gets into a TAXI. Quit.</p>
<p><strong>ext. firing range – eight weeks ago – morning</strong>: West,
screaming at a weasely looking cadet named CHILDS.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Those who wouldn’t quit, he’d put in what he
called Section Eight.</p>
<p><strong>int. section eight barracks – eight weeks ago –
night</strong>: A horribly dilapidated quarters. Four cadets, Dunbar,
Pike, Childs, and MUELLER sleep in rickety bunks.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Washout rejects, guys he said were ,
“dumbfucks too stupid to know they were dead”. He separated us from the
rest. We slept alone…</p>
<p><strong>int. mess hall – eight weeks ago – morning</strong>: The same
four Cadets, eating ON THE FLOOR as the other members of the Cadet Corps
chow at tables.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: . . .ate alone.. .</p>
<p><strong>ext. regular barracks – eight weeks ago – evening</strong>:
The four Cadets fallout on a run shirtless, with heavy packs and rifles
held over their heads as the rest of the Cadet Corps files into their
barracks for sleep.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: …and trained long after the other guys got
to turn in.</p>
<p><strong>ext. parade grounds – eight weeks ago – morning</strong>: The
Cadet Corps, mustered. West zeroes in on NUNEZ , whose t-shirt has a
spot on it.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Fellas lived in daily fear of being
Sectioned and with good reason, too.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: They figured we were the boys who’d meet
with a “training accident” .</p>
<p><strong>int. coffee room – present day</strong>: Osborne leans
forward.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Are you saying Sergeant West tried to kill
you?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: No, ma’am, he just wanted us to quit. Making
it through was kind of an honor. Some of the other guys on the base told
us that if you could hack Section Eight, Command would consider you at
the top of the class.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: That’s not exactly true… I’m living proof.
How did you get Sectioned, Ray?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: That first night with Pike. I made the
mistake of letting him sit down at around 0300.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Tell us about the other guys, the ones West
weeded out.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: There were six of us…</p>
<p><strong>ext. obstacle course.– one week ago – evening</strong>: The
six members of Section Eight on a forced run through the rain. We focus
in each face as Dunbar describes them. First up is MUELLER a tall Aryan
looking blonde with a square jaw.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Mueller was from Tulsa, a real good ol’ boy
type. One of those “his Daddy’s Daddy’s Daddy died at Bull Run and no
bleeding heart Yankee was gonna take away his scatter gun” . He idolized
West.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: And Nunez idolized Mueller. Big fella from
New Mexico. After he got Sectioned he just followed Mueller around like
a lap dog. He wasn’t mean like Mueller, though, didn’t have it in
him.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: But Childs did. Didn’t talk to anyone, but
you got this feeling something was wrong with him, like real wrong. Type
of guy you felt uncomfortable going to sleep near.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Pike I told you about. He took the brunt of
it from Mueller and West. Once they found it out he was a convict they
were merciless.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: He’d been busted for Auto Theft, judge gave
him the option of jailor the Army. He made the wrong choice.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Finally Kendall and me. Kendall was a smart
guy, we got along okay. Pike and I tried to help him, but…</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: He was sickly. Had that shaking thing,
whatd’yacall it, epoxy?</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Epilepsy.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Yeah. Spent half his time in the infirmary.
Only reason he enlisted was his father. West didn’t section him till
last week.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: And those were the guys who went on the
exercise with you?</p>
<p><strong>dun bar</strong>: Yeah. And that’s all I’m saying.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: You smoke, Ray?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: This is one of those interrogation tricks,
isn’t it? You don’t give me a cigarette till I tell you more.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: No, actually, I just left mine in the car and
was hoping you had some.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: My brand. Must be my lucky day.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Let me ask you one thing. You seem like a
good guy, Ray. You carried Kendall wounded to the pickup. So what I
don’t get is what you did to make Nunez want to kill you?</p>
<p><strong>m. p.</strong>: Sirs?</p>
<p><strong>int. fort mckinley – corridors – morning</strong>: Hardy and
Osborne emerge to find Styles waiting for them.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: He’s not done by a longshot, I can get more
out of him-</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: He can wait. Kendall’s out of surgery.</p>
<p><strong>ext. army jeep – morning</strong>: Hardy and Osborne sit in
the back of the open car as it rumbles across the grounds, headed
towards the Base Hospital. They sit in silence until:</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Why’d you join the army?</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: You really want to make banal chit- Chat
like that now?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: You’re right. We should sit in silence.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: We’re in the middle of a murder case-</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Best time for banal chit-chat.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: What is that?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Microrecorder for Kendall - didn’t have- time
to wire his room. Now tell me why you joined the army or I’ll jab this
pen through your neck.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Typical army brat story. Dad was noncom,
Mom was a Nurse. There was never any real doubt of joining up.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: You had a mobile of bayonets above your
crib.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Something like that. You?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: I lost a bet.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: You’re kidding.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Yeah. That’s just the story I tell the girls
to get them into bed. Truth is… I don’t know. The whole honor and duty
thing. Make a difference in the world, crap like that. Didn’t really
work out.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: I bet that’s the second story you tell the
girls to get them into bed, after you make them laugh with the first
one.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: This is the straight hitting on me you were
talking about, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: The very same.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: You do understand that there’s absolutely
no way I could ever be attracted to you, right?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: I plan to grow on you.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: You’re off to a late start.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: So noted.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: You guys really got the shit kicked out of
you here.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Imagine what it must have been like for
them out there. What do you think of Dunbar?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: He’s telling the truth, up to a point.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: What point?</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Something wrong?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Being back here. Gives me the willies.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Not the happiest of memories?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>int. base hospital – recovery unit – day</strong>: A NURSE
leads Hardy and Osborne down a spotless white hall.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Normally we wouldn’t let anyone see him this
soon, but Colonel Styles said it was urgent-</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: It is.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Remember, he’s the son of a Senator, so go
easy. Kid gloves.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Got it.</p>
<p><strong>int. base hospital – kendall’s room – day</strong>: Kendall
lies in a bed, a network of tubes in his arm. He is awake but pale,
still weak. He studies his visitors.</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: You… I’ve seen you around the Base. But
you…</p>
<p>****: You’re not Army, are you?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Coast Guard, special detective detail. We
feel this incident may have put the beaches of Florida at risk.</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: That’s it. You’re that policeman with
friends in low places. Tell me, how’s Guissepe Torres doing these days?
Those racketeering indictments must have really been a downer-</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Levi, you got about four hours before armed
men show up here, put you on a plane to Washington, and lock you in a
very small dark room. I suggest you talk to us.</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: I’ve done nothing wrong. I’m the victim
here.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: But not the only victim, right?</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: My, my, my, how did things turn so hostile
so quickly? If I didn’t know better, I’d say you two were out to get
me.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: We just want-</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: What, “The Truth”? Please. There are
degrees of truth, officer, always degrees. Things are not what they
seem.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: It’s too early in the day for me to give a
shit about some pissant cadet’s bad version of “intrigue”. You want to
talk to us, send word over to the brig. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: You’re working too hard, Levi. I can tell
cause you’re sweating. And you’re sweating cause you have no idea what
Dunbar’s already told us.</p>
<p><strong>int. base hospital – corridors – day</strong>: Hardy and
Osborne walk to the NURSE’S STATION.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: That was kid gloves?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Have no fear, Osborne, we have not yet begun
to fight.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: But we have to question him- Thought you
didn’t have cigarettes-</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: I lied. Wait for it…</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Cadet Kendall-</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: We’re on our way.</p>
<p><strong>int. kendall’s hospital room – day</strong>: Hardy and
Osborne sit across from Kendall’s bed.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Sergeant West is dead isn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: And the other three Cadets?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Feel free to elaborate .</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: My father is a powerful man. Over the years
he’s used that power to protect me, in one form or another, from
certain… unpleasantries. I am a homosexual.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Senator Daddy must be thrilled.</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: He is not, shall we say, wild about the
idea. He has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my
proclivities, and I have done my best to oblige him. However, in the
last four weeks, I began a relationship with another cadet. What do you
think of that?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: I think you just blew “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell”
out of the fucking water.</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: The Sergeant discovered this relationship
and wanted me expelled. My father interceded, so instead, West Sectioned
me and made sure every other cadet knew that I was gay.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: He couldn’t kick you out so he wanted you
to quit on your own.</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: He wanted more than that.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: More intrigue, Levi?</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: It was the regular Tuesday night drill.
He’d let us sleep for an hour and then wake us up, drag us out to the
bayou, and work us all night, separate from the others. The door SLAMS
OPEN, revealing West.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Get up, get up, get up! We’re going on a
little night hike, boys - muster in five on the south tarmac!</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Hurricane’s due after midnight and we’re still
going out?</p>
<p><strong>mueller</strong>: Toughens us up, Pike. You don’t like it,
quit.</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: Maybe we shouldn’t go.</p>
<p><strong>mueller</strong>: The faggot speaks.</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?</p>
<p><strong>mueller</strong>: You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?</p>
<p><strong>nunez</strong>: You really heard this?</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: You know Popham, works in the kitchen? He told
me it was on the radio.</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: We should tell him we’re not going.</p>
<p><strong>mueller</strong>: Oh, yeah, “Excuse me, Sergeant, sir, we
don’t feel like going out - we don’t want to get rained on.” He’ll kick
our asses from here to Cleveland.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: He’s right. We don’t have a choice.</p>
<p><strong>ext. fort mckinley – tarmac – last night</strong>: The six
cadets, mustered in front of West and a TRANSPORT CHOPPER. West hands
out M-16’s, sidearms, and grenades while yelling above the wind.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: A rifle, a pistol, and three phosphorous
grenades to a man! This is live fire, so keep those safetied until we
touch down; I don’t want anyone shooting their dick off!</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Some of you may have heard there’s a hurricane
coming! American soldiers do not wait for good weather - they do not
wait for a bright sunshiney day to do their duty! An American Soldier
learns to operate in the worst conditions and turn said conditions into
an advantage against their enemy! Anyone who thinks these conditions are
too harsh, feel free to lay down and die, you get me?</p>
<p><strong>the cadets</strong>: Sir, yes, sir!</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: LZ is two clicks North of a cabin, you are to
split into teams of two</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: and work your way through your designated area
blasting as many targets as you can find! Each area has twenty targets,
first team to take all twenty and find the cabin wins! Teams are as
follows - Dunbar and Nunez, Pike and Mueller, Kendall and Childs!</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: I will be in the areas monitoring your
progress and if I see anyone drag ass I will personally slit you stem to
sternum and leave you for dead! Fall out!</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: You’re gonna die tonight, faggot.</p>
<p><strong>int. kendall’s hospital room – present day</strong>: Osborne
looks up.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: He said what?</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: “You’re gonna die tonight, faggot” . Clear
as day.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: No one else heard it?</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: He whispered it in my ear.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Levi, I don’t know if you’re familiar with
investigative work, but we have this little thing called “motive” and
you just gave yourself one.</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: You said you wanted to know what happened-
I’m telling you the truth.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: What happened to “degrees”?</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: Didn’t kill him-</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Then who did?</p>
<p><strong>int. army transport helicopter – last night</strong>: On
Kendall, sitting among the Sectioners in silence. terrified he looks
like he’s about to throw up.</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: I wanted to tell someone what he’d said,
but I couldn’t. Mueller would just laugh. Nunez and Childs wouldn’t
care. Pike and Dunbar were okay, but… When West outed me, he isolated
me. An outcast among outcasts. And I’d just been told tonight was the
night I’d die.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: First team, second team, third team, go, go,
go!</p>
<p><strong>ext. louisiana bayou – last night</strong>: We track with
Kendall and Childs as they head away from the Landing Zoe, rifles up,
heads down, side by side. Moving the brush quickly and quietly, eyes
scanning for targets.</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: I knew Childs a little, we worked at the PX
together.</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: I started getting it in my head that maybe
West had paid him, maybe he was the one who was supposed to give me a
training accident-</p>
<p><strong>childs</strong>: Don’t you ever point a gun at me!</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: I’m- I’m sorry. . .</p>
<p><strong>childs</strong>: Come on, let’s move.</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: All I could think of was West, out there
somewhere in the dark. Maybe watching the others, maybe watching me. And
waiting to make his move.</p>
<p><strong>childs</strong>: Christ, am I alone in this world? Shoot
something-</p>
<p><strong>childs</strong>: A target, Kendall, cap a fucking target.
What’s wrong with you?</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: I thought I was gonna have an attack. Go
into a fit and bite off my own tongue in the middle of the bayou. Childs
could tell I wasn’t right.</p>
<p><strong>childs</strong>: Just safety your shit and get behind me,
okay? I’ll take care of this.</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: Maybe it was a trick. Maybe this was when
they’d get me, when I felt safest.</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: But if I struck first and took out Childs,
then maybe I could make it out alive…</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: Maybe I shouldn’t tell you that. Maybe I
should tell you I wasn’t scared at all. But I was… Enough to almost kill
him.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: But you didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: No. Poetic justice, though.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Because Childs is the one who shot you.</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: But that came later.</p>
<p><strong>ext. louisiana bayou – last night</strong>: As Kendall
safeties his rifle and lowers it… The SOUND of a tremendous EXPLOSION
comes from their right! Kendall and Childs knocked off their feet as the
sky momentarily LIGHTS UP with the blast as a MAN SCREAMS!</p>
<p><strong>childs</strong>: Over there!</p>
<p><strong>childs</strong>: Hello! HEL-</p>
<p><strong>get down!</strong>: They hit the deck, face down in mud. It
takes them a second to realize the shots are not directed at them.</p>
<p><strong>childs</strong>: Fuck, what the fuck is going on-</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: What do we do?</p>
<p><strong>childs</strong>: Whoever it is isn’t shooting at us…</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: Don’t want to go-</p>
<p><strong>childs</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>ext. louisiana bayou – creek bed,– last night</strong>: The
SCORCHED GROUND and TREES smolder under the rainfall. Kendall finds
Childs, standing down by the creek. Something lies by his feet.</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: What’s-</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: Oh, Jesus.. .</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: Did- Did you-</p>
<p><strong>childs</strong>: It was the grenade you fucking idiot. Look
at him!</p>
<p><strong>childs</strong>: This isn’t our area. Whose area is This-</p>
<p><strong>mueller</strong>: Can anybody hear me!</p>
<p><strong>mueller</strong>: Hey, I- Holy fuck. .,. holy fuck, what the
fuck did you guys do?</p>
<p><strong>childs</strong>: We found him like this-</p>
<p><strong>mueller</strong>: You killed him you fucking faggot-</p>
<p><strong>childs</strong>: We found him like this! Kendall was with me
the whole- Listen to me!</p>
<p><strong>mueller</strong>: Jesus, Jesus fucking Christ…</p>
<p><strong>childs</strong>: Where’s Pike?</p>
<p><strong>childs</strong>: Mueller, where’s Pike?</p>
<p><strong>mueller</strong>: We got- I don’t know, we got separated</p>
<p><strong>childs</strong>: Before or after the explosion? Mueller-</p>
<p><strong>mueller</strong>: I don’t know!</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: How can you not know-</p>
<p><strong>mueller</strong>: Shut the fuck up, you fucking faggot, You
just shut the FUCK UP-</p>
<p><strong>hey!</strong>: Mueller stops, eyes crazed. Childs looks to
the sky, which is becoming worse by the second.</p>
<p><strong>childs</strong>: We have to get out of this. To find the
cabin.</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: What about Pike?</p>
<p><strong>childs</strong>: Maybe he’ll be there. Either way, we have to
go.</p>
<p><strong>mueller</strong>: Shouldn’t we- I mean, we shouldn’t just
leave him here.</p>
<p><strong>childs</strong>: You can carry him if you want.</p>
<p><strong>ext. louisiana bayou – last night</strong>: Kendall, Childs,
and Mueller make their way through the bush. The WIND and RAIN have
conspired into a FULL BLOWN HURRICANE. The three men are practically
stumbling now, leaning in against it to stay on their feet. Kendall
spies something through the maelstrom. It looks like WET WOOD. He
points:</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: There!</p>
<p><strong>int. cabin – last night</strong>: Obviously abandoned. Bare
of any furniture save for two wooden chairs next to an empty fireplace.
DUNBAR and NUNEZ shout in surprise as the three men practically collapse
into the cabin. Dunbar runs to bolt the door against the elements as
Nunez helps them up.</p>
<p><strong>nunez</strong>: What happened to you-</p>
<p><strong>mueller</strong>: What happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: We finished the course and came here, Then
heard an explosion- Where’s Pike?</p>
<p><strong>childs</strong>: We don’t know. West is dead.</p>
<p><strong>mueller</strong>: They found him. Poor fucker was Practically
blown in half-</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: Poor fucker my ass…</p>
<p><strong>mueller</strong>: You better watch it, faggot, I’m not Sure
you and Childs didn’t do him-</p>
<p><strong>childs</strong>: What about you, wandering around Alone? At
least we have an alibi-</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: What do you mean, alone?</p>
<p><strong>mueller</strong>: Pike and I got separated-</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: Yeah and he doesn’t know when-</p>
<p><strong>mueller</strong>: I remember now, it was before the
Explosion-</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: Oh, you remember now-</p>
<p><strong>mueller</strong>: I’m about two seconds away from seeing If
fairies really can fly-</p>
<p><strong>nunez</strong>: What about Pike?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: He wouldn’t kill anybody. . .</p>
<p><strong>mueller</strong>: Oh, bullshit, he’s a fucking convict. You
know how much he hated West-</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: I hated West, Childs hated West, everyone
with a goddamn brain hated West but that doesn’t mean we killed him!</p>
<p><strong>nunez</strong>: What if it wasn’t one of us? What if it was a
local-</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: He was blown up by a phosphorous grenade,
they don’t exactly sell those at 7-11.</p>
<p><strong>mueller</strong>: Look, here are the facts - Roberto was with
Dunbar, Queen Kendall was with Childs, and Pike’s the only one not here.
He did it!</p>
<p><strong>childs</strong>: He is the only one unaccounted for.</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: Maybe he’s dead too. Maybe you killed Them
both, Mueller-</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Shut up. Let me see your grenades.</p>
<p><strong>mueller</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: We were each given three so whoever killed
West will be missing one.</p>
<p><strong>mueller</strong>: See? Three. Now can we please-</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Hey, guys.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Whose blood is that, Jay? West’s.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Any kindling for afire?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: What do you mean, West’s?</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: I mean I killed him. Isn’t that what we all
wanted?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: He admitted it.</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: Right in front of us. Mueller went after
him but we held him back. Pike surrendered and volunteered to be tied
up. So we roped him to a chair and tried to ride out the storm.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Why would he just surrender?</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: Because he had a plan.</p>
<p><strong>int. cabin – living room – last night</strong>: Pike, tied to
a chair by the fireplace while the others look for, food in the KITCHEN.
Alone, Kendall walks past Pike:</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Hey, Kendall, talk to you for a sec?</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: You hated West as much as I did. I’m not
saying what I did was right, but you can’t tell me you’re not glad the
motherfucker’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: The thing is, we’ve got a real opportunity
here. You turn me in Tomorrow and we’re both fucked-</p>
<p><strong>kenoall</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: A gay Senator’s son who let his Sarge get
fragged on a training exercise? The press’ll crucify you and your
father. His career will be over and it’ll be your fault. But we do this
different and you come out a hero.</p>
<p><strong>kenoall</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Mueller. He’s as bad as West and we both know
it. Now I can’t do it, cause I’m tied up, but we get the others to go
along-</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: Don’t think I want to hear this-</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Someone else can do the deed, it doesn’t have
to be you. Maybe Nunez too, he’s got a tendency to follow Mueller, but
the rest of us can come out ahead - the guys who took out their
Sergeant’s killers!</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: We’ll move the bodies out to the creek and say
we came over the hill right as they fragged West, all we gotta do is
tell the story right.</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: You’re sick, Pike.</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: Later on I.saw him talking to Dunbar. They
had been close. I was in another room when it happened.</p>
<p><strong>int. cabin – kitchen last night</strong>: Kendall, looking
through the empty cabinets for food when A GUNSHOT – From the living
room. As Kendall bolts towards the noise, the air is filled with the
sounds of SCREAMING and SHOOTING! He pushes through the door…</p>
<p><strong>int. cabin – living room – last night</strong>: Kendall,
coming through the door as we SLO-MO… Mueller, sprawled out on the
floor, dead… Pike, tied to the chair, bullethole in his forehead… Nunez,
wounded, stumbling out the front door into the hurricane… And a badly
wounded Childs, pistol out, TURNING towards the SOUND OF THE DOOR and
FIRING… Kendall’s arm, HIT with a SLUG, and he starts to go down…
FREEZE-FRAME – On Kendall’s form, falling.</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: I don’t think he meant to do it. It was
just reflex - he’d already been gutshot. I must have passed out cause
next thing I knew…</p>
<p><strong>ext. louisiana bayou – dawn</strong>: The sounds of RUNNING
and HEAVY BREATHING. Kendall’s eyes flutter open. He’s on Dunbar’s back,
being carried through the woods. The sound of GUNFIRE and a TREE BRANCH
SHATTERS next to them. Someone is chasing them. Trying to kill them.
Nunez.</p>
<p><strong>ext. clearing – dawn</strong>: As Dunbar bursts into the
sunlight, carrying Kendall. The entire thing dreamlike, what we saw at
the opening, but from KENDALL’S VIEWPOINT – the helicopter overhead,
Nunez behind, Dunbar turning and shooting, NUNEZ GOING DOWN…</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: And that’s it.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Nunez was chasing Dunbar.</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: Because he’d shot Mueller.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: But you didn’t see it, right?</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: Like I said, I was in the kitchen. When I
came out, Mueller and Pike were dead, Nunez and Childs were hit and
Dunbar was gone.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Why did he come back for you?</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: I honestly don’t know. Maybe to have
someone to cover for him. And I wish I could, but there’s no doubt in my
mind he killed those men.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Okay. I think that’s it. He rises and walks
to the door.</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: Mr. Hardy?</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: What did Dunbar tell you?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Pike killed West, Dunbar killed Mueller,
Childs, and Nunez.</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: Who killed Pike?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Someone must have got a shot off. He wasn’t
exactly a moving target.</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: It’s too neat.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: “Too neat.” How long have you been an
investigator?</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: I don’t think that has anything to do
with-</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: That means under a year. Let me explain what
ten years of police work has taught me - murder is basic. There are no
conspiracies, no grand mysteries, and no evil puppet masters behind it
all, pulling the strings; murder is shitty people doing a shitty thing
to other shitty people - it doesn’t always make sense but it’s always
neat. Dunbar’s our guy.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: I just… He came back for Kendall. I don’t
think he’s capable of murder.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Everyone’s capable of murder, Osborne.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Look, all we’ve got is what Kendall says,
and he didn’t actually witness any deaths except Nunez. He found West,
he saw Mueller and Pike, but just their bodies - he didn’t see any crime
committed.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Well, I’m sure if he’d known this was all
going to happen he’d have Tried harder to witness it for you-</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: West’s body isn’t in the creek bed.</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: We’ve already been over the terrain twice.
Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: There was a hurricane, Bill, the wind
probably moved it.</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: Habeas Corpus - you have to have a body to
have a crime.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Okay, then let’s widen the search ’to include
the endzone in Giants Stadium and the trunk of my car-</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: Without the body we have no physical proof.
We need a confession.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: From Dunbar? I hate to break this to you, but
I don’t think he’s gonna be all that psyched to put himself in for the
death penalty.</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: Nevertheless-</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Nevertheless what’? Kendall will testify and
that’ll be enough.</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: Not for me.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: You mean not enough to save you.</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: JAG gets here in three hours. Try for the
confession.</p>
<p><strong>int. coffee room – day</strong>: Dunbar looks up as Hardy and
Osborne enter.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Hey, Ray! Just had a nice talk with your
buddy. Kendall - seems you killed three people!</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: That son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: That’d be my reaction too-</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: He’s lying.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Well, why didn’t you say so? We’ll Just drop
all your charges, then-</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: I’m serious-</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Fuck “you’re serious”, Raymond, you got
exactly zero truck with us; right now we’d take the word of a crackhead
over yours, so if you’ve got something to say, say it.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Did Kendall tell you about the PX?</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: He said he worked there-</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: No, did he tell you about it? About the
business Childs ran?</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: What business?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Pills, shots, you name it, Basic’s a lot
easier when you don’t feel pain-</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: So Childs made some side money, so what?
People are dead, Ray, and the only one we have to blame is you-</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Didn’t shoot West-</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Yeah, we know, Pike did.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: You think you know everything, don’t you?
You haven’t even scratched the surface.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: I know enough to know you got two choices -
you can sign a confession, in which case you’ll probably spend the rest
of your life in a military prison, or you can tell us to fuck off, in
which case you’ll probably get the gas chamber. Am I scratching your
surface yet?</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Hardy!</p>
<p><strong>int. fort mckinley – corridors – day</strong>: Hardy, walking
angrily towards the front entrance, wheezing and massaging his neck.
Osborne, runninq to catch up.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Why the fuck wasn’t he in restraints?</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: Tom, where are you going-</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Home, I’m done.</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: What about the confession?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: You want a confession? Why don’t you confess,
Bill: people are dead and you don’t give a shit about it! Only reason
you called me is to protect your fucking job, you know this is your
fault-</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: What the hell are you talking about-</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: I’m talking about West! We had him, Bill, we
were there. You’re the fucking Base Commander, you knew what he did to
Cadets and you let him go on the way he always he has- Styles couldn’t
reassign him, he’s a legend-</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: You knew what he was capable of and you just
stood by. It was just a matter of time till somebody fragged his ass,
and you know what? He deserved it. There’s your confession.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Goddammit, Hardy, you can’t just leave-</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Watch me.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: You said you owed Styles and now you’re
gonna turn your back on him?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: West was a monster! Fifteen years ago, I was
here, I was Section Eight, I was Pike. Fuck being the knife dummy- that
thing he did, stripping Pike down, making him stand outside all night?
He did that every year, he did that to me. Fifteen years ago, I wanted
him dead, and now I’m supposed to care that somebody offed him? Sorry,
no can do. I tried.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: You did more than try. You cracked Dunbar
in less than three minutes, as an investigator you’re phenomenal-</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Phenomenal at taking bribes, right?</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: I was starting to believe you, you know?
That you weren’t who everyone Said. I guess I was wrong-</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Oh, spare me the reverse psychology bullshit!
This isn’t my “great second chance”, Osborne. Everyone thinks I’m a
piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that.
Nobody will ever know what happens here-</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: But you will.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Why do you care?</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Because it’s my job. Because people are
dead. Because of the whole honor and duty thing, make a difference in
the world, crap like that. We can do this, Hardy.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Two and a half hours. That’s all I’m
asking. Two and a half hours to maybe get the truth. Silence.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: I didn’t shoot West…</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Dunbar… He said he didn’t shoot West. West
wasn’t shot, Kendall said he was blown apart by a phosphorous grenade
and Dunbar never saw the body.</p>
<p><strong>int. coffee room – day</strong>: Hardy and Osborne enter to
find Dunbar in SHACKLES.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Apologize-</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: You saw West’s body.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Of course-</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: The creek bed-</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: And he’d been shot.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Yeah-</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: What about the phosphorous grenade?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: One went off, yeah, but it didn’t Touch him-
I thought you knew this-</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Tell it to me.</p>
<p><strong>int. louisiana bayou – creek bed – last night</strong>:
Dunbar and Nunez RUNNING towards the glow of phosphorous and sound of
GUNFIRE. They come over the hill to see Childs and Kendall, standing
over WEST’S BODY. Dunbar stops, shocked.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Holy fuck… Holy fuck, what the fuck did you
guys do?</p>
<p><strong>childs</strong>: We found him like this…</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: Somebody emptied a full clip into him-</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Stop.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Kendall told us Mueller was the one who found
them with West’s body.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: He’s lying, then. We didn’t see Mueller till
we got to the cabin.</p>
<p><strong>int. cabin – last night</strong>: Dunbar, Kendall, Childs,
and Nunez push through the door to find Mueller in his undershirt, a
FIRE burning in the hearth.</p>
<p><strong>mueller</strong>: Jesus, what happened?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: West…he’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Back up.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Mueller was alone in the cabin?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>mue:ller</strong>: Pike and I got separated… then I heard
gunfire. Close.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: So did we. Why didn’t you come?</p>
<p><strong>mueller</strong>: I was afraid… Mueller voice FADES OUT as he
continues to talk.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: I didn’t buy it. But Mueller had all three
of his grenades.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: At least you and Kendall agree on that.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: What happened next? Dunbar shudders.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Pike came back.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: What the fuck happened to you-</p>
<p><strong>mueller</strong>: What the fuck happened to you? One minute
you’re next to me and the next you’re gone and the sky lights up like
fucking Christmas-</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Where have you been, Jay?</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Wandering through a hurricane trying to find
this place. It’s gettin’ bad out there- Where’s West?</p>
<p><strong>childs</strong>: Yeah, right. . .</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Shut up. West’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Where have you been, Jay?</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Oh, no. . . no, fuck that-</p>
<p><strong>nunez</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Roberto, what the fuck?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: We just want to check your pack-</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>mueller</strong>: Whoever shot the Sarge blew a grenade
first-</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Blame the nigger, then, huh? Someone turns up
dead, you just look for the Darkest face in the crowd-</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: You know it’s not like that-</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Do I?</p>
<p><strong>nunez</strong>: Let him check your pack.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Tie him up.</p>
<p><strong>int. cabin – last night</strong>: Later. The fury of the
storm has increased. Kendall, Childs, Nunez, and Mueller, in the KITCHEN
looking for food.</p>
<p><strong>in the living room</strong>: Pike, tied to the chair. Dunbar
sitting in a corner, listening to the hurricane rage outside. Pike
watches him.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Just like the first day, huh? You standing
guard on me.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: This place ain’t gonna hold much longer.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: You and me are friends, right?</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Right?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: You gotta untie me. I didn’t do this thing,
Ray.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: You hated West more than any of us.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Maybe, but that don’t make me a killer-</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: You’re the only one missing a grenade.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Which anyone coulda taken out of my gear on
the chopper. Were you watching your pack on the ride in?</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Ray, this is my life here. I ain’t gonna
pretend I’m not happy West is gone, but you know I couldn’t have done
this. It’s not in me.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: If not you, then who?</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Mueller.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Oh, come on-</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: We’re sweeping our area and suddenly he’s
gone. Couple minutes later, phosphorous grenade pops off about a third
of a click away-</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: That’s exactly what he says about you.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Who you gonna trust, Ray? Him or your
friend?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: You hated West, Mueller loved him-</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Enough to go to prison? Childs’ PX Scam,
Mueller was in on it-</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Look in my pack.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Just look. Little pocket.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Combat grade morphine. Mueller sold it to me.
.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: You’re lying-</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Pull up my sleeve. Right arm.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: That look like a lie to you? I been using
solid for the last eight weeks.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: After that first night on the parade Grounds
with you, I was bad - Exposure, malnutrition, the works. I needed
something to keep me from crashing. Mueller found me.</p>
<p><strong>int. cadet showers – eight weeks ago</strong>: Empty except
for Pike. He sits, nude, curled up on the tile, as the nozzles blast
STEAMING WATER down onto his shivering form. FOOTSTEPS approaching.
Mueller. He leans down next to Pike, speaking to him. Kindly.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: He said he knew guy who had an in at the PX,
could hook me up. This is before I knew what a dick he was.</p>
<p><strong>int. base px – backroom – six weeks ago</strong>: A covert
meeting among stacks of supplies. Childs stands with Mueller, talking to
a gaunt Pike. Behind Pike are a group of other SICKLY LOOKING CADETS,
all jonesing.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Later on Childs got assigned there, started
running the shit out to every cadet who needed it. But I was our class’s
first customer.. .</p>
<p><strong>int. cabin – last night</strong>: Dunbar staring open mouthed
at Pike. Shocked.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Why… why didn’t you tell me?</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Becoming a morphine addict during Basic ain’t
exactly something you want to broadcast. Only Mueller and Childs
know.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: That still doesn’t mean you didn’t kill
him.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: You saw West, right? How was he killed?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Full clip to the body-</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: From up close or far away?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: His chest was hamburger-</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: That’s close range. You go full auto on a guy
from close range, you’re gonna be swimming in blood. Look at my uniform.
Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: And where’s Mueller’s? When I came in, he was
only wearing a t-shirt.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Way I figure it, West must have found out
about their little business and was gonna bust them, so they decided to
get rid of him first…</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: They?</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Mueller and Childs. One of them must’ve taken
the grenade from my pack on the chopper…</p>
<p><strong>int. transport helicopter – earlier last night</strong>: The
Sectioners sit, stonefaced, staring out the window. CLOSE ON - Mueller’s
hand as it snakes into Pike’s pack and extracts a phosphorous
grenade.</p>
<p><strong>ext. louisiana bayou – earlier last night</strong>: Mueller
and Pike, twenty feet apart, scouring the brush for targets. Mueller
looks to Pike and then slips away…</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Then Mueller ditches me during the exercise
and heads for the creek.</p>
<p><strong>ext. louisiana bayou – creek bed,– earlier last
night</strong>: Mueller stands on the hill and pulls the grenades pin,
tossing it down the embankment. ..</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: He blows the grenade to frame me and gets West
to come running… .</p>
<p><strong>ext. louisiana bayou – earlier last night</strong>: Kendall
and Childs, turning towards the sound… Note: Each shot of Kendall and
Childs in this sequence should correspond exactly to Kendall’s
Flashback.</p>
<p><strong>ext. louisiana bayou – creek bed – night</strong>: West
emerges from the bush at a sprint.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: What the fuck is going on?!</p>
<p><strong>mueller</strong>: Don’t know, sir, I-</p>
<p><strong>ext. louisiana bayou – earlier last night</strong>: Kendall
and Childs, running in the direction of the grenade…</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Childs’ job is easy, he only has to delay
Kendall long enough for Mueller to get away.</p>
<p><strong>get down!</strong>: He tackles Kendall into the mud.</p>
<p><strong>ext. louisiana bayou – creek bed – earlier last
night</strong>: Mueller, smoking rifle in hand, uniform covered in blood
stands over WEST’S DEAD BODY. He turns and runs off INTO THE BRUSH. A
moment later, Childs and Kendall come into view at the top of the
embankment…</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Now all Mueller has to do is get rid of the
evidence…</p>
<p><strong>int. cabin – earlier last night</strong>: Mueller, still
covered in blood, enters the dark cabin. He strips of his shirt and
throws it in the fireplace. Striking a match, igniting the bloody rag…
.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: And wait for everyone else to arrive.</p>
<p><strong>int. cabin – last night</strong>: Pike sighs, finished with
his story.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: I… I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: What don’t you know?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: This is a lot of information to be Getting…
I have to think-</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: There’s no time to think, Ray, we gotta get
out of here! You untie me, we grab the guns, get Kendall and Nunez, and
make a run for it-</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: No… no, we can just wait till we get back
and then tell the M.P.’s-</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: We wait and I’m a dead man. I got a black
face, a criminal record, and over a hundred other cadets who’ll testify
how much I hated West - my court martial will take six minutes. It’s
either me or them, Ray, and you gotta decide right now.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Untie me.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Untie me, Ray.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Thank God. . .</p>
<p><strong>mueller</strong>: What the fuck are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>mueller</strong>: Guys, get out here!</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: This place is going, Mueller. We gotta
move-</p>
<p><strong>mueller</strong>: Shut the fuck up. He was gonna cut him
loose.</p>
<p><strong>nunez</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Cause I didn’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>childs</strong>: Get away from there.</p>
<p><strong>mueller</strong>: We all know what you did, Pike. I don’t
know what kind of nigger voodoo You been working in here, but-</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Where’s your shirt, Mueller?</p>
<p><strong>mueller</strong>: Used it to start the fire-</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Still got mine on, not a speck of blood on it.
Not a bad trick for a murderer- you said you burned yours?</p>
<p><strong>mueller</strong>: Was freezing from the hurricane-</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: So you took off your shirt?</p>
<p><strong>mueller</strong>: To start a fire, goddammit! What about him,
huh? Maybe he offed the Sarge and changed shirts, brought an extra one
in his pack. Y’ever think of that? Go ahead, cut him loose! First chance
he gets, he’ll waste the rest of us, that’s how they work-</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Goddammit, Ray, we gotta get out of Here-</p>
<p><strong>mueller</strong>: We’re not going anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Cadet Michael Mueller, I hereby place you
under military arrest for the Murder of Sergeant Nathan West-</p>
<p><strong>mueller</strong>: The fuck are you talking about-</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: You are to be stripped of all weapons And
placed under guard-</p>
<p><strong>mueller</strong>: Bullshit-</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Until we return to base, and ballistics can
match your weapon to the slugs in Sergeant West’s body-</p>
<p><strong>mueller</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: Mueller, what the fuck-</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Don’t do this-</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: A test will no doubt link you to the
Killing-</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Put it down!</p>
<p><strong>mueller</strong>: Tell him to shut up-</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: -failure to comply with this arrest is a court
martialable offense in and of itself-</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: Pike, please-</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Although that won’t matter much when Coupled
with the murder charge-</p>
<p><strong>shut the fuck up you fucking nigger-</strong>: Pike leans
forward.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: You stupid white trash motherfucker, I saw you
do it-</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: Oh.. . my God…</p>
<p><strong>mueller</strong>: He wouldn’t… stop talking…</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: So you killed him?</p>
<p><strong>i. . .</strong>: Almost mechanically, Dunbar begins to reach
for his own gun… The unmistakable sound of a two rifles’ magazines being
RACKED simultaneously. Dunbar turns to see Childs and Nunez, their
M-16’s in hand. Levelled at him.</p>
<p><strong>childs</strong>: Get that hand away.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: You too?</p>
<p><strong>childs</strong>: We can still come out of this okay. Pike got
free, he got a gun, he came after us. That’s the story.</p>
<p><strong>mueller</strong>: West was one thing, but this-</p>
<p><strong>childs</strong>: Shut up, Mueller.</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: You framed-him…</p>
<p><strong>childs</strong>: None of that matters now. We got two dead
bodies and a story that explains them. You’re either with us, or against
us - which is it?</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: Okay-</p>
<p><strong>ext. demolished cabin – first light</strong>: Hours later.
The rain has lessened and the Hurricane has begun to lift as Dunbar
pulls himself from the debris. Hearing a FAINT CRY from his left.</p>
<p><strong>ext. louisiana bayou – sunrise</strong>: Dunbar, carrying
Kendall towards the clearing when GUNFIRE comes from behind. He turns to
look… Nunez. The only other survivor from the Cabin. A hundred yards
back, rifle in hand, coming after them with a vengeance. Dunbar,
sprinting towards the clearing, bullets at his heels and as he bursts
from the tree line he looks up to see a</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: And then I killed the last of them.</p>
<p><strong>int. coffee room – present day</strong>: And we’re back to
the interrogation. Dunbar, stubbing out a cigarette and looking up at
Hardy and Osborne.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Can I have some coffee?</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Yeah… yeah, sure.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: You shot Childs and Nunez.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: They would have killed us both. You want me
to write a confession, I’ll write a confession.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: You saved Kendall’s life-</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: But not Pike’s.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Why didn’t you tell us all this in the
first place?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Would you have believed me?</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Where’s the cabin?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Don’t know on a map. West told us it was
there, we just found it. Maybe the hurricane took it away.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Raymond, for you to have any chance of coming
out of this, we need to locate the other bodies and examine them to
corroborate your testimony. Otherwise this is just another story-</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Mr. Hardy, I joined the army for college
money. I didn’t ask for any of this - I tried to do the right thing out
there and people got killed. You say finding those bodies’ll help me,
then go find them. I don’t want to die.</p>
<p><strong>ext. for mckinley – corridors – day</strong>: Hardy and
Osborne, walking and talking.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Talk it through: Childs, Mueller, and Nunez
know they’re going out on the regular Tuesday Night drill, hurricane or
ho hurricane, so they plan it: Kill West, pin it on Pike.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: And they’re smart about it. They know when
you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated, you need a fall
guy and for that to work, you have to have a witness.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Dunbar.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Exactly, someone who’s not involved, who’s
word can’t be questioned. You only let them see what you want them to
see, you make them believe, so when the time comes, they’ve totally
bought into your version of events.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: They believe the innocent are guilty and
the guilty are innocent.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: And if they’re asked, that’s what they’ll
tell the, world.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: So it’s a good plan but it goes wrong;
Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to
bring Dunbar and Kendall into the Cover story-</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Kendall maybe would have agreed, but The
hurricane buttfucks the cabin-</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Buttfucks the cabin?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: And all hell breaks loose. A lot of Good guys
shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: So why, after Dunbar drags Kendall out from
under a house, does the Senator’s son try and get us to put his savior
in the gas chamber?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: That bugs you too?</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Little bit.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Let’s go talk to Bill…</p>
<p><strong>int. styles’ office – day</strong>: Hardy and Osborne stand
in front of an agitated Styles. He tries to take a hit off his asthma
inhaler and gets nothing. Frustrated, he tosses it away.</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: Fucking asthma… This whole thing’s driving
it nuts.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: What I said before-</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: Was dead right. You think Dunbar’s on the
level?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: Does Osborne agree?</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Yes, sir, I do.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Dunbar’s confession. It should be enough to
get you out of trouble.</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: You want Kendall, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: He tried to burn Dunbar to us. You don’t do
that if you’re not involved.</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: You both know if you do this, if you go
after a Senator’s son and you’re wrong… it’s not just me in the hot seat
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: We know.</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: I’m giving you a chance to walk away.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: We know.</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: You don’t get to be a Colonel without
compromising. Without getting out of the way of the bigger dogs. You
politic, play it safe, think of the career first. And when things get
dirty, you just look the other way…</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: Four of my men are dead. You think Kendall
had something to do with it, then you go get the son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Pike never confessed.</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: We’ve been making progress, I see.</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: Running out of time, are we? Tick- Tock,
tick-tock, how long till your witnesses fly the coop?</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Fifty minutes.</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: Not much time to solve the crime. Tell me,
detective, how did it feel taking blood money from Guissepe Torres? Did
it weigh on your conscience or did you just not think about it?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: You tried to pin three stone murders on
Dunbar-</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: How many murders did you cover up? One?
Five? Maybe an even ten.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Can I go to jail for punching a guy who’s
been shot?</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: I think they’re giving me the wrong
medicine. This isn’t a very good Hospital, you know-</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: Epileptic attacks are murder on your
system. Rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: My heart weeps.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Pike never confessed.</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: No, but it got you interested, didn’t it?
Got you to dig. Inspired Ray to tell you terribly sordid tales about
drugs and creek beds and dead little sergeants who stuck their noses
where they didn’t belong.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Is it the truth?</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: There’s that word again. As I told you, I
wasn’t in the room when everyone started shooting.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Dunbar says you were.</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: Then he’s mistaken. You know, I really
don’t think my father would approve of this line of questioning-</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Why did you tell us he shot everybody, Levi?
You put him in for three murders, the man saved your life-</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: So I should stay silent about his misdeeds?
The guns went off, I ran in, Childs shot me, Pike and Mueller were dead,
and Dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun-</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh… See
that’s where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was
running out the door.</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: No. I said Dunbar.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Huh. You know, I really thought you said
Nunez. I thought you said “Dunbar was gone,” My fault, I gotta check the
tape on that. Oh, yeah we taped the last interview. This one too. Cause
it’d be a real break for us to catch you in a lie.</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: I believe your next line is “What are you
trying to hide?”</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: Sorry to disappoint. I’m on painkillers for
the injury - they cloud the mind. You’re right, it was Nunez. Any more
questions?</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: Don’t get me wrong, Mueller and Childs were
quite the pair, the type of guys you didn’t feel comfortable going to
sleep around. Completely capable of murder. But as I said, I didn’t hear
the exchange before the shooting. I wasn’t in the room.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Dunbar will testify that you were.</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: Then we’ll leave it up to the courts - His
word against mine. What does his father do again? Steelworker? Doesn’t
matter, I’m sure justice will be served. In any case, my father will
definitely want to talk to you about all these questions, these
accusations on his son. He’s quite protective.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: I need to talk to you outside.</p>
<p><strong>ext. base hospital – corridor – day</strong>: Osborne and
Hardy, exiting the room. Whispering:</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: We’re fucked, I know-</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: They got their stories straight.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: What Kendall said - “the type of guys you
don’t feel comfortable going to sleep around.” That’s what Dunbar said
about Childs to the letter.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Positive. Hardy, they planned this.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Not bad for hostile and uncooperative,
eh?</p>
<p><strong>int. kendall’s hospital room – day</strong>: Hardy and
Osborne reenter, smiling. Kendall chuckles.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Something funny, Levi?</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: I was just thinking of what’s going to
happen to your careers when my father gets through with you.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Why don’t you talk to Levi off the record for
a second?</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Good idea.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: You and Dunbar got your stories straight.
Little details, little inconsistencies, designed to bounce us back from
one of you to the other, asking questions, killing time, until the
transport arrives and whisks you away to where Senator Daddy can protect
you. You think you’re just going to slide out of this? You’re an
accessory to murder, Levi, you’re Going to jail-</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: You can’t threaten me-</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Jail if he’s lucky, the gas chamber if he’s
not-</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: Didn’t do anything-</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: It doesn’t matter, Levi. We’re going to
find those bodies and when we do, I’m going to make sure one of them has
a bullet in them that matches your weapon-</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: That’s a fantastic idea-</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: See, I just take your gun to the morgue and
fire it into one of their skulls; then I call every newspaper in the
country with the story about how Senator Kendall’s gay son went nuts on
a training mission-</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: It won’t work-</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: It will and you know why?</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Because you’re not a person anymore, you’re
a cadet in the United States Army; you have no identity, no Miranda
warning, and no rights. So I’m gonna throw you to the wolves, and unlike
you I’m gonna get away with it, because you’re pissing me off!</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Enjoy your flight to Washington-</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: Wait-</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: What.</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: Dunbar’s telling the truth.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Wrong answer-</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: We did get our stories straight, but not
because we killed anyone. It was because I threatened him.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: Because of what I saw. Who really killed
West.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Who killed Sergeant West?</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Who, Levi-</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: Childs.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: Because I was standing next to him.</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: I was in on the PX thing. He and Mueller
and me, we were making thousands. West found out. Childs said we were
just gonna scare him - Use my Dad’s clout. I had this whole speech
prepared about how if he ratted us, his career was over. We met him in
the creek bed but before I said anything…</p>
<p><strong>ext. louisiana bayou – creek bed – last night</strong>: West
stands in front of Childs and Kendall, facing them. Kendall opens his
mouth to speak, but Childs steps forward and raises his rifle,
FIRING…</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: I swear, I didn’t know he was gonna do it.
After, he told me we were gonna pin it on Pike, one of our biggest
customers.</p>
<p><strong>int. cabin – last night</strong>: As they TIE PIKE to the,
chair.</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: Nobody’d believe the word of a black junkie
ex-con against ours.</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: He told me I’d better keep quiet, or I’d
end up the same as West.</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: Dunbar didn’t know anything about any of
it. Everything he told you was true, except after…</p>
<p><strong>ext. louisiana bayou – last night</strong>: Dunbar pulls
Kendall from the cabin’s wreckage. As Kendall begins to talk to him,
Dunbar’s eyes widen in shock. ..</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: I told him what had really happened to
West. Told him to keep quiet about it or I’d destroy him. Because if it
came out that I was involved with the whole PX scam, my father would be
finished.</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: I scared Dunbar into silence. He’s been
trying to cover for me the whole time. We got here, you came to see me…
I didn’t know if I could trust him with that kind of secret-</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: So you framed him. The same way Childs was
going to frame Pike.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Little advice, Levi, next time you frame a
guy, pick someone who can’t defend themselves.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: What happened with Nunez?</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: He came after us. And I told Dunbar he had
to kill him…</p>
<p><strong>ext. clearing – earlier that morning</strong>: The
helicopter, hovering overhead. Dunbar, carrying Kendall, spinning his
rifle to face Nunez, sixty yards away. Dunbar hesitates before firing,
not wanting to…</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: Do it!</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: And he did.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: That’s how you do good cop/bad cop.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Childs did it, huh?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: First Pike, then Mueller, now Childs? When
are we getting to the others? When are we gonna hear about Nunez?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Or Dunbar?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Or you, Levi? When is it finally going to
come out that you were the one who killed him?</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: I didn’t-</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: But you can’t prove it! You can’t prove
anything until we find the bodies!</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: You lied to us, Levi, you’re going to the gas
chamber unless you tell us where to find them!</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: I don’t know-</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Where are they!</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: Maybe-</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Get something between his teeth!</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: What is-</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: He’s an epileptic!</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: You’re going to have to wait outside-</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: He’s a witness!</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: It doesn’t matter, outside-</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: F-F-F-F-F-F-Fuh-</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: He’s trying to say something-</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Out, NOW.</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: Fuh-Fuh-Fuh-Fuh-Fuh-</p>
<p><strong>security!</strong>: Kendall looks up, focusing on Osborne, a
slight moment of clarity in his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>kendall</strong>: Fuh-Fucking Pike.</p>
<p><strong>int. base hospital – waiting room – day</strong>: Later.
Hardy and Osborne sit in silence, eyes downcast. Waiting. Hardy pulls
his last cigarette from the pack, lights it, crumples the pack and
tosses it into a garbage can.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: I pushed him too hard.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: You couldn’t have known-</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Yeah, I could’ve. Should’ve.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: You wanted to get the truth.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: No, I didn’t. I wanted to humiliate him. For
what he did to Dunbar. For fucking over the little guy.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: You mean the falsely accused?</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: You wanted to break him.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: So did I.</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: It’s over. Time of death was 4:42.</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: JAG’s been notified and I called the Senator
myself. My report will reflect that his medical condition made this
unavoidable… you two had no culpability in the matter.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: That’s horseshit and you know it.</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: Maybe. But it’s my fault and I’ll carry
it.</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: We found the cabin. Demolished, like they
said. No bodies. Hurricane like that coulda scooped ’em up, dropped them
down two counties over. We’ll find them.</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: You think you could explain all this to
me?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: I wouldn’t know where to start. I guess it
was about one man framing another. He thought if the other guy got
blamed, people would over look his own wrong doings.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: What happens to Dunbar now?</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: Gets on his plane in ten minutes, which
means you two are done. You’ll understand if I don’t walk you out.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: They’re taking your command, aren’t they?</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: The Senator…</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: I’m sorry, Bill.</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: Don’t be. I’m not cut out to deal with the
West’s of the world.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: You’re a good soldier, Bill.</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: I thought you said that wasn’t a
compliment.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: This time it is.</p>
<p><strong>ext. fort mckinley – parade grounds – evening</strong>: The
sun, beginning to dip in the sky, as Hardy and Osborne exit the
hospital.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Your car’s in the motor pool. I’ll walk you
over.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: So what now?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget
this ever happened.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Think it’ll work?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Nah.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: You know, you never told me why you left
the army.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: It dawned on me one day that we were supposed
to be a nation founded on the principle of questioning authority… and
all I did here was follow orders. It didn’t add up.</p>
<p>****: Plus, I got kicked out.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: That’s gonna stay my secret.</p>
<p><strong>int. motor pool – evening</strong>: Hardy and Osborne make
their way towards Hardy’s car.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: We were close to something with
Kendall.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Maybe… Maybe we were nowhere near. I haven’t
by any chance grown on you, have I?</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Good, just making sure.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: We’re going need a vehicle release.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Sign here and here. Hey, ain’t you the
folks workin’ on that whole hulabaloo from last night?</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Terrible tragedy. One of those Section
Eight boys worked in here. Pike. Heard he got out okay.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Hate to be the bearer of bad news, Sergeant,
but he didn’t make it.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Funny. I swear I saw them bring him and
the smaller guy in this morning.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: No, no that was Cadet Dunbar-</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: You mean Ray Dunbar? Well, that ain’t
right.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: I saw ’em get off the chopper. White guys,
right? Two</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Ma’am, Ray Dunbar’s black.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Did I say something wrong-</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: What runway’s that transport leaving
from?</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Four-</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Get in.</p>
<p><strong>ext. fort mckinley – parade grounds – evening</strong>:
CADETS SCATTER as Hardy’s car ROARS OUT OF THE MOTOR POOL, PEELING
across the grass towards the far side of the base! Hardy, white
knuckling the wheel, doing his best to steer around anyone who can’t get
out of the way in time.</p>
<p><strong>ext. fort mckinley runway four – evening</strong>: A Large
TRANSPORT PLANE sits on the runway waiting as three M.P.’s and a JAG
LAWYER lead Dunbar/Pike out to it.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: We need to talk to him-</p>
<p><strong>jag lawyer</strong>: Sorry, Officer, we have a schedule To
keep-</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: We need to talk to him now.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: We’re not finished yet-</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: You wanna bet?</p>
<p><strong>jag lawyer</strong>: M.P.’s, escort this man off the
base!</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Sorry, detectives. Time’s up.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: James Randall Pike, COME ON DOWN!</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Let’s go have a talk.</p>
<p><strong>int. coffee room – evening</strong>: Hardy and Osborne
roughly lead Dunbar into the room, the JAG Lawyer trailing behind,
shouting:</p>
<p><strong>jag lawyer</strong>: This is your entire career here-</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Fuck off.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: We got maybe three minutes till they break
it down.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Right back where we started.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: You want to talk about baseball now?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: No more games, right, Pike? It was you who
West singled out…</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: You who got hooked by Mueller’s morphine…</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: You who did it all.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: You wanted revenge on West, revenge on them
all, so you killed them.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: But that wasn’t enough. You needed a new
identity, because no one was going to believe James Randall Pike,
convicted felon, had acted so nobly in the face of danger - you needed a
name people could trust, one that hadn’t been to jail, one that hadn’t
publicly been West’s bitch boy.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: You kept Kendall alive to corroborate your
story and he did it all they way up to the end. You even gave him his
own motive in case we decided to burn him, too.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Can’t do that now, though, can you?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: You walked into the army a convicted felon
with a sentence of five years in a uniform and were going walk out eight
weeks later with a different name, a clean record, and an honorable
discharge - a guy who did “everything he could” to save his friends.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Is that what I did, now? And of course, you
can prove all of it.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: We can prove that you’re not Ray Dunbar.
Impersonating a fellow Cadet is a court-martial in and of itself-</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Did I ever claim I was Raymond Dunbar? Was I
ever told to state my name rank and serial number for the record?
No. You assumed who I was, because I was wearing this uniform. Don’t
believe me?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Check your tapes.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: We don’t need the tapes-</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Oh, you don’t? What else do you have on me?
You haven’t found any bodies yet, have you?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: We’ve found all of them.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Ohhhh, I don’t think so…</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: How do you know that?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Just a guess. Maybe they’re not where
they’re supposed to be. Maybe somebody moved them. Habeas Corpus - no
bodies, no crime, and Nunez still plays as self defense. Face it
detectives … you have nothing.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Not true, Cadet, I’ve got a gun-</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Hardy, what are you doing-</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Isn’t this how your story goes? Pike annoys
someone so much he gets shot in the head-</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Please, please don’t-</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: We can tie you to the chair if it’ll work
better for you-</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Hardy, for Chrissakes-</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: You’ll never find it-</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: You’ll never find it cause HE’S NOT</p>
<p><strong>dead!</strong>: A CRASH as the door’s lock SNAPS and M.P.’s
POUR into the room! Styles and the JAG Lawyer behind, taking in the
scene.</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: What in God’s name is going on?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: He- He made me do it-</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Do what?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Hunting- we had to hunt him-</p>
<p><strong>jag lawyer</strong>: Sergeant, arrest these men!</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: You mean the exercise?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: There never was an exercise! Never targets,
never teams, I don’t even know if there’s a creek bed out there-</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: What did you do?</p>
<p><strong>jag lawyer</strong>: That’s enough-</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Goddammit, what did you DO?!</p>
<p><strong>i couldn’t kill him!</strong>: He breaks down sobbing. Styles
holds up a hand to the M.P.’s.</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: Hang on.</p>
<p><strong>jag lawyer</strong>: Colonel-</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: No. I want to hear this.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: You’re right. I was the one he singled out.
Beat me morning, noon, and night, ran me ragged. When Mueller found me,
I was gone. He gave me a little taste…</p>
<p><strong>int. cadet showers – eight weeks ago</strong>: Mueller
showing the syringe to the naked Dunbar. Dunbar’s voice over speaks in
unison with Mueller:</p>
<p><strong>mueller and dunbar</strong>: I got a friend with an in at the
PX, can hook you up…</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: What I didn’t know, was his friend was West.
He ran the whole thing.</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: You’re lying, son.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: You think it’s easy to have all that
morphine just disappear without a higher up authorizing it? Check the
requisition orders, I’ll lay money it’s his signature on them.</p>
<p><strong>int. section eight barracks – eight weeks ago</strong>:
Dunbar, alone, sleeve rolled up, arm tied off: Sliding the needle into
his vein…</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: That was his game, see? Ride the cadets so
hard they’d need something to stay on their feet. Then he’d send Mueller
or Kendall to them, waving around their magic needle promising to make
it all go away.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: It wasn’t a new thing either. He’d been
doing this for years.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Every nine weeks, a new class of cadets, new
potential customers. The amount of money involved over that period of
time… this was some high stakes shit.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Dunbar moved his through the kitchen. I
worked in the motor pool and hooked all the mechanics. By the time the
hurricane hit, we were all in. Some using, some pushing, some both. But
then something happened. West heard one of us was about to talk, to blow
his whole operation. He figured he’d made enough money, had enough of
the army, maybe it was time to disappear. But first he was gonna teach
us one last thing.</p>
<p><strong>int. section eight barracks – last night</strong>: West,
entering the,barracks, shouting the cadets awake.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: The Tuesday Night drill was the perfect
cover. The hurricane made it even better.</p>
<p><strong>ext. fort mckinley – tarmac – last night</strong>: The
cadets, climbing aboard the chopper.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: He put us on the chopper and flew us to his
cabin. And then he told us.</p>
<p><strong>int. cabin – last night</strong>: The six men stand in rigid
formation, eyes on West.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Gentlemen! It has come to my attention that
there is a traitor in our midst. Someone who was going to break the code
of fraternal brotherhood that I have endeavored to create in all of you.
Perhaps that failure is mine. But we take care of our own. And this
traitor must be made to pay.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Run.</p>
<p><strong>nunez</strong>: Sir, I wasn’t-</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: I know you were. Cadet Mueller found the
letter you’d written to the Colonel in your locker. You were going to
betray us all. Now, run.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Now we’ll see whose training’s paid off the
most. You are to hunt Cadet Nunez down and bring his body back to me. If
you fail and he escapes, we all go down together.</p>
<p><strong>ext. louisiana bayou – last night</strong>: Lightning,
thunder, and rain as Nunez runs unarmed through the thick brush.
SOMEWHERE BEHIND HIM - The other five fan out, rifles up, following his
trail, ready to kill.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: It was insanity. We were hunting a man down
to kill him.</p>
<p><strong>on mueller</strong>: Making his way down embankment, M-l6
out, ready for anything. From behind him, MOVEMENT…</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: He got Mueller first.</p>
<p><strong>mueller</strong>: Roberto…</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: He took his gun. Used it on Childs.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: I can’t imagine what it was like. Having
your friends try to kill you…</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: But you do what you have to survive.</p>
<p><strong>elsewhere</strong>: PIKE, creeping through the foliage.
Trying to listen for sounds of movement through the storm. His eyes
narrow as he hears a HIGH PITCHED WHINE… The bullet hits his forehead
dead center. He crumples. PULL BACK TO REVEAL - Nunez in a tree, thirty
meters away. Lowering his rifle. He climbs down.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Kendall and I found Dunbar a couple minutes
later.</p>
<p><strong>time cut to:</strong>: Dunbar and Kendall come upon Pike’s
fallen form. They gaze down at the uniform emblazoned with the name
“DUNBAR”.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: It came to me in a split second. Change
clothes, change identities. If James Pike gets discharged he goes right
back to jail. But if I was Dunbar, I could walk away from all this with
a new life. But then…</p>
<p><strong>nunez</strong>: Put it down!</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: I just want to go!</p>
<p><strong>nunez</strong>: You were gonna kill me, Pike! Thought you
were my friend!</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: I have to get Kendall to a hospital!</p>
<p><strong>nunez</strong>: He was gonna kill me too!</p>
<p>****: I snapped Mueller’s neck! He was my best friend and I had to
snap his neck because he was gonna shoot me for drugs! For West!</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: We don’t have to do this! You go that way,
I’ll go this way!</p>
<p><strong>nunez</strong>: You’ll shoot me in the back!</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: You killed three people! Isn’t that enough
for one night?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: I don’t want to die out here, Roberto! Do
you?</p>
<p><strong>nunez</strong>: If you even twitch…</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Forgive me. ..</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Congratulations, Cadet Pike. You get the gold
star.</p>
<p><strong>dun bar</strong>: Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: You’d best get him out of here. Don’t worry
about the bodies, they’ll be taken care of.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: This is where we part ways, Cadet. You tell
them I died out here, or I’ll come back for you. Tell them one of the
others did me. Mueller, Childs, I don’t care who. You and Kendall, you
tell them a story. You can tell a story, can’t you?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Dismissed.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: I guess Nunez wasn’t dead after all. He came
after us with a vengeance. You know the rest.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: And the bodies?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: You won’t find them. Won’t find West,
either. He’s too good.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: No bodies, no West…</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: No death certificates. No crime.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Just four people MIA. Silence.</p>
<p><strong>jag lawyer</strong>: You’ll testify to this, the corruption,
the drug scam?</p>
<p><strong>jag lawyer</strong>: We can cut a deal for you on the Nunez
killing.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: I don’t want any deals.</p>
<p><strong>jag lawyer</strong>: If you’re telling the truth, the PX
requisition records will prove it-</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: All the proof you need will be when West
comes back and puts a bullet in my brain. But I’ll do it. I’m a dead
man, anyway. Like Kendall. We both should have died out there with our
brothers. I know that now.</p>
<p><strong>jag lawyer</strong>: I’ll take him now if you don’t mind.</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Tell me, detective. Did you get what you
wanted?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Not even close.</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: Tom-</p>
<p><strong>int. fort mckinley – officer’s club – night</strong>: Several
hours and bourbons later, Hardy sits at the bar, drunk and alone. Out of
place, the only one not in uniform. Osborne walks in, locates Hardy, and
strides over to the bar, a sheaf of papers under her arm. Her face,
stoic.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: We need to talk-</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Seven.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Seven guys. What was it you said? You were
“just starting to believe I wasn’t the guy people said”.</p>
<p>****: Seven. That’s the answer to Kendall’s question. How many?
Seven.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: This isn’t the time-</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: This is the perfect time. You know what makes
a good detective? The number of confessions they get. You’re a good
detective, Osborne. So now you get mine.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: What if I don’t want it?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Tough.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Thing about taking money is, you don’t have
to do anything. You just sit there. Maybe you don’t return a phone call.
Maybe you don’t follow up a lead. But that’s it. Keep the money, your
work’s done.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Seven unsolved murders. And you know what? It
didn’t weigh on my conscience. Not one goddamn bit.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: That’s not true.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: There are degrees of truth, officer. Always
degrees.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: You’re a good man, Hardy.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Really.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Far as I’m concerned, whatever you did in
the past can stay in the past.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: I may not be growing on you, but you’re sure
as hell growing on me.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: And because you’re a good man, I know
you’ll do the right thing.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Pike never made it to D.C.. Somebody took
him off the plane before it left. My guess is he’s already dead.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: West?</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Nobody saw. But I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: These are the requisitions from the PX, the
ones used to release the drugs to Mueller. West signed half of them -
Pike was telling the truth. Look who signed the other half.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Do I have a choice in this?</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Yeah. I can wait till you’re off the base
and do it myself.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Fuck it. Let’s go finish this.</p>
<p><strong>int. styles’ office – night</strong>: Styles, finishing his
paperwork. He rises and turns off his desk light, bathing the office in
DARKNESS. He’s about to leave when he notices a SILHOUETTE in the
doorway.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: “You have to get out of the way of the bigger
dogs”. That was good.</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: Tom, is that you?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: It was so good, I actually forgot you’re one
of the bigger dogs now. The Base Commander. The one in control.</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: If you let him testify then it would have all
come out. West was supposed to take care of it out there, shut Nunez up
and then disappear. But it got messy and people got killed. So you
called your old pal Tom Hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he’d
cover for you.</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: You’re drunk-</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: I’m not going to cover for you, Bill. Not for
this.</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: Look-</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Stay where you are.</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: Or what? You’ve gone round the bend-</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: West had a partner. Someone who knew how to
get things done.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: What I can’t understand is why you signed
these. If you’d just let West take care of the paperwork, no one would
have known, but you got careless. So when Pike finally told the truth
you had to get rid of him, too.</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: That’s preposterous-</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Toxicology report came back. Kendall’s attack
was caused by a drug known as anephadrine, maybe you’ve heard of it.
It’s for asthmatics. If an epileptic takes enough, it kills them. I
checked with the nurses at the hospital - you’re the only other person
who visited Kendall.</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: Wanted to see if he was okay-</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: You poisoned him, Bill. You heard our
interrogation, you knew he was ready to crack, so you killed him, just
like Pike.</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: I’m not even going to dignify that-</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: No! You will stand there and you will listen!
What happened to you, Bill? You were the one who joined up to do good in
the world. You were the one who believed in it-</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: You want to get into a finger pointing
contest about character? The army kicked you out for drugs, the cops
fired you for taking bribes from a mobster, and you think you can stand
there and lecture me on codes of conduct? There’s only one criminal
standing in this room and it’s you.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Not for long.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: No more witnesses. West’s a ghost. But it
doesn’t matter because we have your signature, the hospital log, and
Kendall’s toxicology report. And that’ll be enough.</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: You’re crazy-</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: You can’t duck this, Bill. I may have done
every goddamn thing in my life wrong but I won’t let this happen.</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: For the last time, I have no idea what
you’re talking about-</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Get your hands away from the desk!</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Osborne, gun!</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: It’s West’s, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Now it’s over.</p>
<p><strong>ext. fort mckinley – parade grounds – night</strong>: The
aftermath. Flashing blue and red lights from parked Military Police
vehicles illuminate the grounds as M.P. ’S string crime scene tape
around the front entrance of the building, securing the site for
investigation. Hardy takes in the entire scene from afar. Standing by
his GTO, watching as several M.P.’s finish questioning Osborne. When
she’s done she spies Hardy and walks over to him.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: What are you doing out here?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you
gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Go home, get drunk, and try and forget this
ever happened.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Think it’ll work?</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Nah.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Want company?</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: A word of advice about women - that first
hour or so after they kill their boss? Probably not the best time to hit
on them.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: I should probably write that down.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Yeah. .</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Your phone number?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: In case you need me to testify about the
shooting. They’ll clear you.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: He was your friend.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Yeah. But he was a lot of other things, too.
Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: I’ll see you.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: Hey, Hardy!</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: I owe you this.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: You saved my life tonight. Keep it. Actually,
don’t keep it, I need the money.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: You’re one of the good ones, Osborne. Don’t
sweat the details.</p>
<p><strong>int. osborne’s apartment – night</strong>: A bottle of Scotch
at her side, Osborne slips a tape marked “BASIC TRAINING INTRO - SGT. N.
WEST” into her VCR. Settles back to watch it. West’s face fills the
screen.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Welcome, Cadets. The art of warfare is simple
and complex. Simple in its goal, complex in its execution.</p>
<p><strong>int. hardy’s gto – night</strong>: It’s started to rain.
Hardy drives in silence.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: As Sun Tzu writes, the true warfare is
deception.</p>
<p><strong>int. osborne’s apartment – night</strong>: Osborne, drinking
and watching.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: At all times you must confuse your enemies,
surrounding them with uncertainty, giving them false hope.</p>
<p><strong>int. hardy’s gto – night</strong>: The Hitchhiker gets into
the car.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: At all times, you must mask your true
intentions.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Why’d you ask for a cop, Ray?</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: They got their stories straight. . .</p>
<p><strong>ext. louisiana bayou – creek bed – last night</strong>: 24
hours ago. The hurricane rages. A HAND pulls the PIN on a phosphorous
grenade and CHUCKS IT. It blows, frying brush and nothing more. West
comes over the hill, running to investigate. He stops at what he sees.
Nunez stands unarmed in the creek bed, SURROUNDED by the other Section
Eight Cadets. A prisoner.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: What the fuck is going on?</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Your weapons, Sergeant.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Is this about that little drug business you
all are running? Yeah, I know about that, Roberto told me-</p>
<p><strong>nunez</strong>: Shut up! Look, we won’t say anything-</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Fuck that. You little pissers really think you
can throw a scare into me?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: You’re gonna have to do a lot better than
that, son.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: How about this?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Didn’t I kick your ass out for this drug thing
fifteen years ago?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Should’ve known you were involved in this.
Come on then. Let’s see you try and stick me-</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Stem to sternum. You taught me well,
Sarge.</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: You think you could explain all this to
me?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: I wouldn’t know where to start.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: I guess it was about one man framing
another…</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: When you commit a crime you know is going to
be investigated, you need a fall guy.. .</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: The one who won’t talk was trading live fire
with the dead one as we reached the pick-up.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: And for that to work, you have to have a
witness…</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Someone who’s not involved, who’s word can’t
be questioned…</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: You only let them see what you want them to
see, you make them believe…</p>
<p><strong>int. officer’s club – earlier</strong>: Osborne, showing
Hardy the requisition forms.</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: They believe the innocent are guilty and
the guilty are innocent.</p>
<p><strong>ext. fort mckinley – earlier</strong>: After shooting Styles,
Osborne gives her story to the M.P.’s.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: And if they’re asked, that’s what they’ll
tell the world.</p>
<p><strong>int. osborne’s apartment – present night</strong>: Osborne,
watching the taped West.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Your greatest weapon will by your allies . .
.</p>
<p><strong>int. coffee room – earlier</strong>: Hardy, taking a
cigarette from Dunbar’s pack.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: My brand. Must be my lucky day.</p>
<p><strong>int. kendall’s hospital room – earlier</strong>: Kendall,
coughing fit. Hardy, getting him a GLASS OF WATER.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: . . . some of which you may have to sacrifice
for the greater good.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: We got the toxicology report . . .</p>
<p><strong>int. styles’ office – earlier</strong>: Hardy, confronting
Styles in the dark.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Make no mistake, the innocent will die. .
.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Next time you frame a guy, pick someone who
can’t defend themselves… But it will not be in vain. Sometimes, you can
trick the enemy into doing your work for you. . .</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: He still carry those guns?</p>
<p><strong>int. styles’ office – earlier</strong>: Earlier. Alone, Hardy
plants West’s pistol in Styles’ desk.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: …if you engage in a clever enough
subterfuge.</p>
<p><strong>int. base px – backroom – earlier</strong>: Hardy stands
behind Kendall and Dunbar, overseeing them as they fill out requisition
forms. Kendall signs West’s signature, Dunbar signs Styles’.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: What I can’t understand is why you signed
these…</p>
<p><strong>osborne</strong>: You never told me why you got kicked out
of…</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: The army kicked you out for drugs…</p>
<p><strong>mueller and dunbar</strong>: I got a friend with an in at the
PX, can hook you up…</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: There’s only one criminal standing in this
room and it’s you.</p>
<p><strong>int. osborne’s apartment – night</strong>: Osborne, watching
the tape of West’s speech.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Which brings us to the simple goal. For the
true warrior, the one and only objective is to emerge from conflict
unscathed.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: I promised them I’d ask you where West and
the others are…</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Washout rejects, guys he said were
“dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead”…</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: He’s telling the truth up to a point…</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: You can’t prove anything until we find the
bodies…</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: All we gotta do is tell the story right…</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: You haven’t found any bodies yet, have
you…</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: Habeas Corpus - you have to have a body to
have a crime.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: You can tell a story, can’t you?</p>
<p><strong>ext. roadhouse parking lot – night</strong>: Silence. We
slowly move towards Hardy’s parked GTO…</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Murder is basic.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: There are no conspiracies, no grand
mysteries, no evil puppet masters behind it all, pulling the
strings.</p>
<p><strong>int. gto trunk – night</strong>: WEST’S BODY, stuffed into
the trunk of Hardy’s car.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Everyone’s capable of murder, Osborne.</p>
<p><strong>ext. clearing – this morning</strong>: Dunbar lays the
wounded Kendall down as the Helicopter carrying Styles comes in for a
landing. Dunbar wipes the sweat from Kendall’s brow and asks him
seriously:</p>
<p><strong>dunbar</strong>: Are you ready for this?</p>
