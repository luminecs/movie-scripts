<h1 id="bringing-out-the-dead">bringing-out-the-dead</h1>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Thursday started out with a bang: a gunshot
to the chest on a drug deal gone bad. Heat, humidity, moonlight– all the
elements in place for a long weekend. I was good at my job: there were
periods when my hands moved with a speed and skill beyond me and my mind
worked with a cool authority I had never known. But in the last year I
had started to lose that control. Things had turned bad. I hadn’t saved
anyone for months. I just needed a few slow nights, a week without
tragedy followed by a couple of days off.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: We’re there.</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Which apartment? Which apartment?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Move back. Where’s the stairs? 5A.</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Oh Jesus, it’s Mr. Burke.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: We were just watching TV and Dad yelled out
and started punching his chest, next thing he locked himself in the
bathroom. I said we were gonna call you guys and he said not to. He was
crying, I never heard him crying before, then he sorta stopped. We
pulled him out and put him on the bed.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: How long ago did he stop breathing?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Maybe ten minutes. Woman on the phone tried to
tell us how to do CPR. Please, you gotta do something.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: We’ll do all we can.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Clear! Clear!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: No more, please don’t!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: In the last year I had come to believe in
such things as spirits leaving the body and not wanting to be put back,
spirits angry at the awkward places death had left them. I understood
how crazy it was to think this way, but I was convinced if I turned
around, I’d see Old Man Burke standing at the window, watching, waiting
for us to finish.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’ll take over. Call ER and ask for an
eighty-three. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Do you have any music?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Music. I think it helps if you play something
he liked.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: John, play the Sinatra.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Play the Sinatra.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: It’s OK, Frank. We can call it. Eighty-
three.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: No we can’t. He’s got a pulse.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: No shit.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Is he going to be alright?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: His heart’s beating.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Have ’em bring up a stretcher.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Help your family. Ride with your mother and
brother. Help your family. They need you more. Help yourself.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I needed to concentrate because my mind
tended to wander on these short trips. It was the neighborhood I grew up
in and where I had worked most as a paramedic, and it held more ghosts
per square foot than any other.</p>
<p><strong>er</strong>: a white-lit cement box painted yellow and
decorated with old framed Playbills. Four rows of six plastic chairs
face a TV bolted and chained to the ceiling. The seats are filled with
backed-up drunks, assault victims and “regulars,” bleeding and spilling
over against the walls and the floor, getting up to ask their status or
going out to throw up and have a smoke.</p>
<p><strong>griss</strong>: Hey partner. Your man does not look well.
They’re not gonna appreciate you inside.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Griss, let us in.</p>
<p><strong>griss</strong>: Things are backing up.</p>
<p><strong>griss</strong>: You can’t go in there, folks.</p>
<p><strong>nurse constance</strong>: Just keep moving. Don’t even slow
down.</p>
<p><strong>nurse constance</strong>: Sir, you say you’ve been snorting
cocaine for three days and now you feel your heart is beating too fast
and you would like us to help you. To tell the truth, I don’t see why I
should. If I’m mistaken, correct me. Did we sell you the cocaine? Did we
push it up your nose?</p>
<p><strong>noel</strong>: For God’s sake, give me some water.</p>
<p><strong>big feet</strong>: Shut up! Goddamn civilians.</p>
<p><strong>noel</strong>: Give me some water!</p>
<p><strong>nurse crupp</strong>: Don’t take another step. We’re on
diversion. Can’t accept any more patients. Your dispatcher should have
told you.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: We got him at Eighteen and Second. You’re
closest.</p>
<p><strong>nurse crupp</strong>: Where will I put him, Frank? Look. Tell
me.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: He wanted to come here. Said the nurses at
Misery were the best.</p>
<p><strong>nurse crupp</strong>: All right, give me a minute. I’ll kick
someone out of slot three.</p>
<p><strong>noel</strong>: Excuse me. You are a very kind man. I can see
that. A man like you could not refuse a poor sick dying helpless man a
small cup of water.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I can’t. I have to stay with my patient.</p>
<p><strong>big feet</strong>: Shut the fuck up! If it wasn’t for these
dun feet I’d get up and kick your ass!</p>
<p><strong>hazmat</strong>: Godammit, guys, what are you doing to me?
We’re all backed up in here. Christ, would you look at him? He’s gonna
need the works. What’s wrong with him?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: You should know. You pronounced him.</p>
<p><strong>hazmat</strong>: You told me he was dead. Flatline.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: He got better.</p>
<p><strong>hazmat</strong>: I hate pronouncing people dead over the
phone. Better, huh? They’re fixed and dilated. He’s plant food.</p>
<p><strong>nurse crupp</strong>: We stole a stretcher from X-ray. No pad
on it, but I don’t think he’ll mind. Put him in three, next to the
overdose.</p>
<p><strong>hazmat</strong>: He’s our lowest priority now. He shouldn’t
even be here. All this technology. What a waste.</p>
<p><strong>griss</strong>: Please folks, step back. Don’t make me take
off my sunglasses.</p>
<p><strong>hazmat</strong>: First-time heart attack, age 45. Should have
gone to the CCU ten hours ago. There’s three bodies up there Mike the
one you just brought in. over there, two AIDS patients, one in twelve
filling up with liquid. I’m gonna hafta intubate because the kid’s
mother won’t sign the Do Not Resuscitate. Mercy killing doesn’t
translate well in Spanish. It’s a sin to tube this kid. Three more ODs
from some new killer junk. They call it Red Death.</p>
<p><strong>noel</strong>: Water, water, water, doctor man, water.</p>
<p><strong>hazmat</strong>: A mix of heroin and I don’t know what else,
some kind of amino acid maybe. Stuff so strong they’re drinking it with
grain alcohol. You have to use ten times the usual amount of Narcan and
watch out when they wake up, liable to go nuts on you.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: He one of them?</p>
<p><strong>hazmat</strong>: No, that’s Noel. Used to be a regular off
and on, hasn’t been in in a while. He seized and almost coded–I gave him
a hypertonic solution. He drank so much the kidneys were taking out
salt. One for the textbooks.</p>
<p><strong>noel</strong>: Oh doctor, you are the greatest. You must help
me.</p>
<p><strong>big feet</strong>: For God’s sake, give him a drink of
water.</p>
<p><strong>hazmat</strong>: I am helping you, Noel. You could die if you
drink more water.</p>
<p><strong>hazmat</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>hazmat</strong>: Crupp, start CPR. Milagros, get me an epi.
Odette wake up Dr. Stark. Tell him I need a blood gas, stat.</p>
<p><strong>noel</strong>: Bless you sir, bless you.</p>
<p><strong>big feet</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>nurse constance</strong>: … so you get drunk every day and
you fall down. Tell me why we should help you when you’re going to get
drunk tomorrow and fall down again?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: He’s very very sick.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I know him. That’s Noel.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: We’d better go outside. Quickly.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Is there any chance?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I guess there’s always a chance.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Noel, Noel, it’s me, Mary. From 17th
Street.</p>
<p><strong>noel</strong>: Mary, Mary, Mary. I’m so thirsty. They won’t
give me anything to drink. Please, Mary.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’ll get you some.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I wouldn’t do that. The doctor seems to think
he’s suffering from some rare disorder.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: It’s not so rare. He grew up on our street.
He’s had a rough life and he’s a little crazy from it, but that’s no
excuse for not giving someone a lousy cup of water.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: My father’s dying, Noel.</p>
<p><strong>noel</strong>: Oh Mary, Mary, Mary.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: The Chinese close in five minutes. Beef lo
mein. It’s been on my mind since I woke. Whatjathink?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I think the moment that food hits your mouth
we’ll get a job.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Turn here. You missed it. The Chink is on
3rd.</p>
<p><strong>whore #1</strong>: Hey ambulance man. What you looking
at?</p>
<p><strong>whore #2</strong>: Pretty soon you’ll be coming for me.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Some partner you are Frank. I coulda walked
there faster. I’m starving and you stop to talk to hookers. You’re
making me nuts. Is that what you’re trying to do, drag me down with you
to nutsville?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Oh no!–I just remembered.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I’m so stupid. I had beef lo mein last night.
I can’t eat the same thing two nights in a row. It’s almost two o’clock,
what the hell am I gonna do? What you getting?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’m not hungry.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Oh yeah, you don’t eat food.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I eat. I just haven’t had coffee yet.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Coffee and whiskey, lucky you ain’t dead with
that diet. Wait, I’ve got it. Half fried chicken with fries. Let’s go,
hurry up. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Rose was getting closer. Ever since the call
a month before, when I’d lost her, she seemed like all the girls in the
neighborhood. One of the first things you learn is to avoid bad
memories. I used to be an expert, but lately I’d found some holes.
Anything could trigger it. The last month belonged to Rose, but there
were a hundred more ready to come out.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: These spirits were part of the job. It was
impossible to pass a building that didn’t bold the spirit of something:
the eyes of a corpse, the screams of a loved one. All bodies leave their
mark. You cannot be near the new dead without feeling it.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I could handle that. What haunted me now was
more savage: spirits born half-finished, homicides, suicides, overdoses,
innocent or not, accusing me of being there, witnessing a humiliation
which they could never forgive.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Turn it off.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: You know what. The radio.</p>
<p><strong>police dispatch</strong>: Ladder Four, respond to a 10-22
four flight residential, 317 East 32nd.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Let’s do it. It might be a good one.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You wanted it turned off. There’s no such
thing as a good fire. People get burned up. They can’t breathe.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: That’s what we’re here for. Come on,
Frank.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Don’t push it, Larry.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: You’re burned out.</p>
<p><strong>radio dispatcher</strong>: One-three Zebra. Zebra three, I
need you.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: You see, he’s giving it to us anyway.</p>
<p><strong>radio dispatcher</strong>: Zebra, are you there? I’m holding
an unconscious at First and St. Marks.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: No! It’s three o’clock. That can only mean
one thing.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Mr. Oh.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: It’s Mr. Oh. I’m not answering it.</p>
<p><strong>radio dispatcher</strong>: Answer the radio Zebra. You know
it’s that time.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Four times this week I’ve had him. Aren’t
there any other units out there? Don’t answer the radio. They’ll give it
to someone else.</p>
<p><strong>radio dispatcher</strong>: Thirteen Zebra. One-Three Zebra.
You’re going out of service in two seconds.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Look, Frank, when I say don’t answer it, that
means answer it. You can do that for me at least. Three Zebra.</p>
<p><strong>radio dispatcher</strong>: Yes, Zebra. You’ll be driving to
the man who needs no introduction, chronic caller of the year three
straight and shooting for number four. The duke of drunk, the king of
stink, our most frequent flier, Mr. Oh.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Ten-four. Don’t go. Not this time.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Relax, it’s a street job, easy except for the
smell. We’ll just throw him in back and zip over to Mercy–no blood, no
dying, that’s how I look at it. He’s just a drunk.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: It’s not our job to taxi drunks around.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: They’ll just keep calling.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Someone’s gonna die someday causa that bum,
going to have a cardiac and the only medics will be taking care of
Mr. Oh.</p>
<p><strong>male street person #1</strong>: He’s bad mister. He ain’t
eaten nuthin all day, he’s seizing and throwing up.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: So what’s different?</p>
<p><strong>male street person #1</strong>: He says his feet hurt.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Well why didn’t you say so?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: He’s drunk.</p>
<p><strong>male street person #2</strong>: He’s sick. You gotta help
him.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: He’s fine. He can walk to the hospital.</p>
<p><strong>female street person</strong>: Walk? You crazy? He’s in a
wheelchair.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Don’t start that. I’ve seen him walk. He
walks better than me.</p>
<p><strong>mr. oh</strong>: Oh, oh, oh.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: That’s him, Mr. Oh. Get up.</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: Good luck! Get better!</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Faster! God!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Faster!</p>
<p><strong>griss</strong>: Get that stinky-assed motherfucking
bug-ridden skell out of my face.</p>
<p><strong>nurse constance</strong>: I would have to register you to
give you something to eat and my conscience just will not allow that.
Griss, the gentleman wants to leave. He looks pale. You’re not eating
enough. You need more fiber.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: He’s wasted. That’s my diagnosis:
shit-faced.</p>
<p><strong>nurse constance</strong>: He just needs a bath and some food.
Take him in back and see if you can find a stretcher.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: She’s nuts. That’s why he comes here. She
encourages him.</p>
<p><strong>nurse crupp</strong>: Don’t you dare! That’s my last
stretcher. This is not a homeless shelter. He’ll have to wait in the
lobby.</p>
<p><strong>griss</strong>: No way man. Not even in the corner. Griss
cannot abide the funk tonight.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: It’s my first cigarette in over a year.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: The first is always the best.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: It’s the waiting that’s killing me, not
knowing, you know? It’s really hard on my mother. The doctor doesn’t
think my father’ll make it. He says he was dead too long, after six
minutes the brain starts to die and once that goes, close the door.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You never know.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I mean if he was dead, I could handle
that.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: At least he’s got people around him.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’m not so sure. My father and I haven’t
spoken in three years. When my brother called to say my father was
having a heart attack, that he’d locked himself in the bathroom, all the
way going over I was thinking how I was gonna tell him what a bastard he
was. Then when I got up the stairs and we moved him onto the bed, I
thought of all these other things I wanted to say.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Even when you say the things, there’s always
more things.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Right now, I’m more worried about my mother
than anything. They won’t let her see my father.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Go home. Take her home. Get some rest. Not
going to find anything out now.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: That’s what I told her. If she could just see
him a second, then I could take her home.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Time to switch. I wheel, you heal.</p>
<p><strong>radio dispatcher</strong>: 12 David on the corner of Thirty-
eight and Two you’ll find a three- car accident, two taxis and a taxi.
One-two Henry, 427 East Two-two, report of a very bad smell. No further
information …</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Larry, swing over on Eighth. We’re gonna
hafta run one of these calls.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Relax, will you.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: The biggest problem with not driving is that
whenever there’s a patient in back you’re also in the back. The doors
close, you’re trapped. Four in the morning is always the worst time for
me, just before dawn, just when you’ve been lulled into thinking it
might be safe to close your eyes for one minute. That’s when I first
found Rose …</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: She was on the sidewalk, not breathing.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’m not feeling very well, Larry. I say we go
back to the hospital and call it a night.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: You have no sick time, Frank. No time of any
kind. Everyone knows that.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Take me back, put me to bed; I surrender.
We’ve done enough damage tonight.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: You take things too seriously. Look at us,
we’re cruising around, talking, taking some quiet time, getting paid for
it. We’ve got a good job here.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Yeah, you’re right.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Tell me, you ever think of doing anything
else?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Sure, I’m taking the captain’s exam next
year. After the kids are in school, Louise can go back to the post
office and, I thought, what the hell, I’ll start my own medic service.
Out on the Island the volunteers are becoming salaried municipal. It’s
just a matter of time and who you know. Someday it’s going to be Chief
Larry calling the shots.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’d always had nightmares, but now the ghosts
didn’t wait for me to sleep. I drank every day. Help others and you help
yourself, that was my motto, but I hadn’t saved anyone in months. It
seemed all my patients were dying. I’d waited, sure the sickness would
break, tomorrow night, the next call, the feeling would drop away. More
than anything else I wanted to sleep like that, close my eyes and drift
away …</p>
<p><strong>timecut</strong>: radio wakes Frank from his reverie.</p>
<p><strong>radio dispatcher</strong>: Zebra. One-three Zebra. Zebra,
answer the radio. Come on, I’ve got one for you. Pick up the radio and
push the button on the side and speak into the front.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Zebra.</p>
<p><strong>radio dispatcher</strong>: Male bleeding, corner of Houston
and One. No further information.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Ten-four.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: We have a call Chief. Somebody’s bleeding,
Houston and First.</p>
<p><strong>noel</strong>: Kill me!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Noel, don’t!</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: He’s crazy.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You really think so?</p>
<p><strong>noel</strong>: See, I can’t do it. I came out of the
desert.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You came out of the hospital. You were tied
down and hallucinating. You got some bad chemicals in your head, Noel.
There’s some medicine at the hospital that will fix that.</p>
<p><strong>noel</strong>: No, no medicine!</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: He got you.</p>
<p><strong>black punk</strong>: Do it! Man wants to die. Take him out! I
know how to kill that mother. Pop, pop.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Noel, you didn’t let me finish. We have rules
against killing people on the street. Looks bad, but there’s a special
room at the hospital for terminating. A nice quiet room with a big
bed.</p>
<p><strong>noel</strong>: Oh man, do you mean that? Thank you man, thank
you. How?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Well, you have your choice: pills, injection,
gas.</p>
<p><strong>noel</strong>: I think pills. Yes, pills, definitely.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Jesus, Tom Walls, that crazy
motherfucker.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Used to be my partner.</p>
<p><strong>walls</strong>: Frank, this the guy you called about? I know
him. You give my friend here any trouble and I’ll kill you.</p>
<p><strong>noel</strong>: Yes, at the hospital.</p>
<p><strong>walls</strong>: This looks like a very bad man I took in a
couple weeks ago, a man who’d been holding two priests hostage with a
screwdriver. I told him if I ever caught him making trouble again I’d
kick the murdering life outta him.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It’s not worth it, Tom. He’s
surrendering.</p>
<p><strong>walls</strong>: No prisoners. Don’t worry, Frank, just a
little psychological first aid.</p>
<p><strong>walls</strong>: Stay still, dammit!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Don’t do it, Tom!</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: There’s a double shooting three blocks- up.
First and Third. confirmed.</p>
<p><strong>walls</strong>: We’ll do it.</p>
<p><strong>noel</strong>: At the hospital. You told me at the
hospital.</p>
<p><strong>frank &amp; walls</strong>: EMS. Move it!</p>
<p><strong>bystander</strong>: Man just walked up and shot ’em. Not a
word. Man, that was cold.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Where you hit?</p>
<p><strong>voice in crowd</strong>: Outlaw did this. He works for
Cy.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Major Tom, I’m going to Misery. You take
yours to Bellvue.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You’re gonna feel a stick in your arm. Don’t
move.</p>
<p><strong>drug dealer</strong>: I don’t want to die.</p>
<p><strong>noel</strong>: I want to die. I’m the one.</p>
<p><strong>drug dealer</strong>: Oh Jesus, I don’t want to die.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You’re not going to die.</p>
<p><strong>noel</strong>: What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Shut up. You’re going to die and he’s not.
Got it.</p>
<p><strong>drug dealer</strong>: Hold my hand.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I can’t. I got to do the other arm.</p>
<p><strong>drug dealer</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Hold this–right there. If you let go, I
swear, I won’t kill you.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It’s all right. We’re here.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Noel, let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: He’s not breathing. Call a code.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Hello again.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You shouldn’t smoke.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It’s okay. They’re prescription. Works better
with a little whiskey.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: That’s my brother’s problem. He’s passed out
inside.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: That’s it! I can’t do it anymore!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: That boy you brought in, he was shot, wasn’t
he?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: He’s dead, huh?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I think this place stinks.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Our Lady of Misery.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Did you see my father?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: It’s crazy in there. What’s wrong with that
doctor? He keeps mumbling, poking himself in the eye when he talks to
me.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: He’s working a double shift.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Thing is, I’m supposed to be the fuckup. The
one on the stretcher in there–that’s supposed to be me. With my parents
crying out here. I got a lot of guilt, you know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: My father’s in a coma, now my mother’s going
crazy. It’s like she’s in a trance.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: She should go home.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’d take her, but then who would stay
here?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Here she is.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. burke</strong>: It wasn’t him.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You saw him?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. burke</strong>: They showed me someone. It wasn’t him.
It wasn’t my husband.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Mrs. Burke, please, they’ll take care of him.
You should go home now.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. burke</strong>: I should know my own husband. They
wouldn’t let me see him.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Larry and I’ll drop her back home. Help me
get her to the ambulance.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. burke</strong>: You want some coffee? I have some apple
sauce cake too.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Saving someone’s life is like falling in
love, the best drug in the world. For days, sometimes weeks afterwards,
you walk the street making infinite whatever you see. Once, for weeks I
couldn’t feel the earth. Everything I touched became light. Horns played
in my shoes; flowers fell from my pockets …</p>
<p><strong>time dissolves</strong>: Frank paces the room. Pours himself
another drink.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You wonder if you’ve become immortal, as if
you saved your own life as well. What was once criminal and happenstance
suddenly makes sense. God has passed through you, why deny it, that for
a moment there, God was you.</p>
<p><strong>time dissolve</strong>: window is closed. Frank tosses in his
sleep.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Good morning, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>capt. barney</strong>: What am I going to to do with this
guy? Pierce, I was just on the phone with Borough Command. Out of twelve
shifts this month, you’ve been late for nine, sick four and that
includes the shift where you came late and went home early.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’m sick. That’s what I’ve been telling
you.</p>
<p><strong>capt. barney</strong>: You’re killing me, you know that? You
got no sick time according to Command. I’ve been told to terminate.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It’s okay. I’ll just get my things out of the
locker.</p>
<p><strong>capt. barney</strong>: I’ve never fired anyone in my
life.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’m sorry Captain. Don’t take it too
hard.</p>
<p><strong>capt. barney</strong>: Nobody tells me to fire anyone. I told
them: shove it up the big one. Sorry. I said, you want to fire him, come
over and do it yourself.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You know they won’t do it. It’s up to you.
You gotta be strong.</p>
<p><strong>capt. barney</strong>: I feel for you, but we got an
emergency here. It’s a weekend of full moons. Everyone’s called in sick.
Larry, Veeber, Stanley too. We need bodies out there. I had to put
Marcus on Twelve Young. You know he’s not supposed to work two nights in
a row.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You swore you’d fire me if I came in late
again.</p>
<p><strong>capt. barney</strong>: I’ll fire you tomorrow. Hell, better
than that, I’ll forward you some sick time. A week, two weeks off– how
about that?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I don’t think a week’s gonna do it.</p>
<p><strong>capt. barney</strong>: I’m sorry, Pierce. You’re going out
with Marcus. Duty calls. The City needs you.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: My Lord mother man, you look like hell. What
were you drinking?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: The captain almost fired me tonight. I’m on
my way out. Anytime now.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Nobody gets fired. Look at me. Only thing
they might do is transfer you to the Bronx. You look like you aged ten
years since I rode with you last.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: The ghosts–</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: You ever notice people who see shit always,
are crazy?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I think the worst is over.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: It can always get worse. You can’t change
what’s out there, only where you’re coming from. You got to let the Lord
take over, in here.</p>
<p><strong>dispatcher love</strong>: Twelve Young. Let’s go, Twelve
Young. Answer the radio.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Hey, Marcus, it’s Love. I haven’t heard her
in months.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: She only works when I’m on. I make her wait
and it drives her crazy.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Is it true that you and Love went on a blind
date? She hit you with a bottle?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: She loves me the way no woman ever has.</p>
<p><strong>dispatcher love</strong>: Twelve Young, I don’t have time for
your games. Now answer me or do I have to come out there myself?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: I usually don’t do calls before coffee. But
I think it might do you some good. Twelve Young is here and I’m gonna
take care of you, baby. Don’t you worry about a thing, yahear, cause
Marcus is alive and on arrival.</p>
<p><strong>dispatcher love</strong>: I’m not your baby, Young, I’m not
your mother either. You’re going to a cardiac arrest, Avenue C and
Ninth, northeast corner. It’s a club. Take the side entrance.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Ten-four, hon. This is for you.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: I hope we’re not late from you guys holding
us up here.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Okay, what happened?</p>
<p><strong>drummer</strong>: He’s going to be all right, right?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: No. He’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>drummer</strong>: No way, man.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: He’s dead and there’s nothing we can do.
Come on, Frank, that’s it.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: He’s not dead. It’s a heroin overdose. Break
out the Narcon.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: He’s dead unless you folks want to stop
bullshitting me and tell it straight. Then, Lord willing, we’ll try to
bring him back.</p>
<p><strong>bystander</strong>: He broke up with his old lady.</p>
<p><strong>girlfriend</strong>: We didn’t break up. We were just seeing
other people.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: I’m still waiting and this young man is
still dead.</p>
<p><strong>bystander</strong>: She broke his heart.</p>
<p><strong>drummer</strong>: All right, all right, he’s been snorting
that Red Death stuff. Been going for four days.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: What’s his name?</p>
<p><strong>drummer</strong>: IB Bangin.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: What’d you mean IB Bangin? What kind of name
is IB Bangin?</p>
<p><strong>girlfriend</strong>: It’s Frederick. Frederick Smith.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Okay, Freddy.</p>
<p><strong>girlfriend</strong>: It’s Frederick.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Okay, IB Bangin, we’re gonna bring you back.
Every person here grab the hand of the person next to you.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Oh Lord, here I am again to ask one more
chance for a sinner. Bring back IB Bangin, Lord. You have the power, the
might, the super light, to spare this worthless man.</p>
<p><strong>girlfriend</strong>: Frederick!</p>
<p><strong>bystander</strong>: Oh wow, man. Oh wow.</p>
<p><strong>ib bangin</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>girlfriend</strong>: You died, you stupid bastard. I warned
you.</p>
<p><strong>drummer</strong>: You guys are awesome.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: C’mon.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Not us. The first step is Love. The second
is Mercy.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: That guy I brought in yesterday, post-cardiac
arrest. He’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>hazmat</strong>: Burke. You won’t believe it. He’s showing
cognitive signs. He started with spontaneous respiration, now he’s
fighting to pull out the tube. Had to sedate him. He’s in a CAT scan.
I’m giving him every test I can: thromboytics, steroids, nitrodrips,
heparin.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>hazmat</strong>: Who knows? It’s all lower-brain-stem-
activity. The heart refuses to stabilize–he’s coded eleven times since
he got here. This guy’s a fighter. Every time the Valium wears off he
starts yanking those restraints.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: The family know?</p>
<p><strong>hazmat</strong>: I wanted to bring them in, to see if he’d
respond to voices, but they weren’t in the waiting room. The guy’s
daughter was in my face all last night and when I finally have something
positive to tell her, she’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>nurse constance</strong>: … you put poison in your veins and
now that you’re breathing again you can’t wait to say thank you and go
back to poison shopping. Well, since we saved your life, maybe you could
do us a favor and stop breathing in another city next time …</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: I ever tell you about the time years ago I
was on this ledge uptown, trying to talk this psycho inside?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Where the guy jumped and you almost fell. No,
you never told me that story.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: No, you never listened. I was going, man, if
someone on high hadn’t pulled me in. I had put all I had into saving
this dumbass lowlife suicidal that when he went down, there was a part
of me that wanted to go with him.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Make a left here. I want to stop.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Hello, I’m Frank Pierce, from the ambulance
last night. I brought your father into the hospital and I just learned
some news.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’ll be right down.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: He’s better, isn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Well, the doctor says he’s showing some
movement. It’s still early, it might mean nothing, but I thought you’d
want to know.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I knew. I sensed it when I heard your
voice.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You look so different.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I know. It’s awful, isn’t it? Night of the
Living Cheerleaders.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I think it looks good.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I was going nuts in that waiting room so I
came back to check on my mom.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: How is she?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Sleeping.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I was just going to get some food. Pizza.
Maybe we could.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You can’t kill my father that easy. He’ll
fight forever. Like with me: hasn’t talked to me in three years. But
it’s okay. Sometimes you have to put things behind you.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Be tough to get a taxi here. We can give you
a ride if you like.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Who’s that?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: She’s the daughter of a cardiac arrest I
brought in last night. I told her we’d give her a ride back to Misery.
Her father’s showing signs of improving.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Oh, Frank, you’ve got it bad, so much worse
than I thought.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’m hungry too. We gotta get some food after
this.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: God help us, he’s hungry too.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Dad, can you hear me? Open your eyes if you
can hear me.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: He squeezed my hand!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: He’s moving, Doctor. He grabbed my hand. Move
your hand, Dad, one more time. See. See.</p>
<p><strong>hazmat</strong>: I’ll be damned. It’s movement, but I’m not
sure how voluntary.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: He hears me. Open your eyes, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>hazmat</strong>: Nurse Crupp, I need ten milligrams of
Valium.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Why don’t we go outside for a little while,
wait until this passes.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: He wants to pull that tube out. It’s pretty
painful–that’s why they keep him sedated–but it’s a good sign.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You sure? I know my father would hate to be
tied down. He wouldn’t even go to the dentist.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: That’s how it’s done. You have to keep the
body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their
own.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: He’s better, though, right?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: He’s better.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Look, I’m sorry, but it’s important to me. I
mean, a week ago I was wishing he was dead. And now I want hear his
voice again, just once more– you know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Went over to Sal’s got this. There must be
some place in Hell for a guy who sells a dollar-fifty a slice. I call
you if anything comes up.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’m not really hungry.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: My father was a great man, you know. There was
nobody he wouldn’t help. You know that crazy guy Noel who I gave water
to last night? He lived in our house for almost a year. A total stranger
he’d do anything for, his own family though …</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It’s best not to … It’s good pizza, huh?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Not as good as Nino’s.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You remember that pizza place, Joe’s on Tenth
Street maybe fifteen years ago? When you ordered a pie it came with a
little plastic madonna in the middle?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Yeah, or Saint Anthony. You from the
neighborhood?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I grew up on Elizabeth. I went to Blessed
Sacrament.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: On yeah? I went to Holy Name. Where’d you go
to high school?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: We moved out after that. Upstate.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Like everybody else–except us. Always standing
on the sidewalk waving goodbye to moving trucks. Your parents … ?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: They’re fine. My old man was a bus driver,
mom a nurse–I was sort of born to it, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You married?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Ah, no. I was. It’s hard to explain. She had
a hard time adjusting to, well, maybe it was my fault too.</p>
<p><strong>drunk</strong>: White cocksuckers! Get your–Ow!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Is it always this bad in here? I mean, how
does anyone survive?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It’s been bad lately, but it’s always
bad.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: How long you been doing this?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Five years.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Wow, you musta seen some things, huh? What’s
the worst thing you ever seen?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You learn to sort of block it out, you know,
like cops fence off a crime scene. But then something good will happen
and everything will just glow.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You must get a lot of overdoses. I bet you
picked me up a couple of times.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I think I’d remember that.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Maybe not. I was a different person then. Does
everybody you meet spill their problems on you like this?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Mostly. It must be my face. My mother always
said I looked like a priest.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I better go check on my father. Thanks for the
pizza. I owe you one. Maybe when he gets better, you know, when we’re
done with all this.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Look after her, Griss, okay?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Rule number one: Don’t get involved with
patients. Rule number two: Don’t get involved with patient’s daughters.
You understand?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What about rule number three: Don’t get
involved with dispatchers named Love.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: You don’t know the first thing about rule
number three, cannot begin to understand the complexities of that rule.
Come on, let’s go look at some hookers. The Kit Kat will be letting out.
Don’t ever call a junkie whore a crackhead. They get real mad.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Look at these women. You can’t even tell
who’s a hooker anymore. Whatever happened to go-go boots and hot pants?
They wear anything now, walk outta the house with whatever they got on
…</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: The street is so much more unpredictable than
the ER and to prepare for the unexpected I was taught to act without
thinking, like an army private who can take apart and reassemble a gun
blindfolded …</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I realized that my training was useful in
less than ten percent of the calls and saving someone’s life was rarer
than that. As the years went by I grew to understand that my role was
less about saving lives than about bearing witness. I was a grief mop
and much of my job was to remove, if even for a short time, the grief
starter or the grief product. It was enough I simply showed up.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: … look at her. Leaves you no idea what’s
underneath, not even a suggestion. Could be a skeleton for all you
know.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Nice though, pulling back her hood as we
drive by. There’s a mystery to it, then she shows you.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: She’s no whore, Marcus.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: We’re all whores, Frank. You know what I’m
talking about, the way she looked at me.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: She wasn’t looking at you, man, she was
looking at me.</p>
<p><strong>“rose”</strong>: Why did you kill me, Frank?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I didn’t kill you.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: No, you didn’t, Frank, thank you. But
there’s still a couple hours left on the shift.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I need a drink, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>dispatcher love</strong>: Twelve Young, answer the radio. I
have a call for you.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: She said to me, I love the way you talk on
the radio.</p>
<p><strong>dispatcher love</strong>: I can’t wait all night, Young. I’m
holding a priority and if you don’t answer I’m going to knock you out of
service.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Don’t worry, hon. Young is here and he’s
gonna help out–just remember, you owe me.</p>
<p><strong>dispatcher love</strong>: You’re going to three-four Avenue
C, 17 year-old female cardiac arrest, no further information.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Ten-four, hon.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Look at that. A fat junkie. That’s a
first.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What’s wrong.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: No English. She has terrible pain in her
belly.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Pregnant.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: No, no, that’s impossible.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Are you pregnant? Estas embarazada?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Can you walk? Puedes caminar?</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: She say she in great pain.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Thanks for the translation. What’s your name?
Nombre?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Maria.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Let’s have a look.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: You know each other a long time?</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Two years. Ever since we left island.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: In that time, you ever have sex?</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Never. No cigarettes, no drugs, no
booze.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: No underwear?</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: We are virgins.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Oh Jesus, we’d better go. Call for
backup.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It’s coming. Hold her down.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: What’s that, Frank?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Three legs.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: That’s too many.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Backup?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: It’s coming.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Is she dying?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: She’s having a baby. Twins.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Es impossible.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You can trust me on this one.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: It’s a miracle.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You take the first one.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: She had a pulse.</p>
<p><strong>nurse constance</strong>: Code! Code Blue!</p>
<p><strong>hazmat</strong>: Oh Jesus, put her on the monitor. Where’s
the pediatric code cart? Odette give me that tube. All right,
flatline–let’s do CPR. step back, Frank. How many months?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Can’t tell. It was a breech, twins. The other
one seems okay, though. Marcus is taking him and the mother to
Maternity.</p>
<p><strong>crackhead</strong>: I’m a mother! I got a daughter! I got
rights!</p>
<p><strong>hazmat</strong>: 10 mil Valium, stat.</p>
<p><strong>mishra</strong>: Status.</p>
<p><strong>nurse constance</strong>: I think there’s a pulse. I
think.</p>
<p><strong>mishra</strong>: Fuck.</p>
<p><strong>nurse constance</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>noel</strong>: Excuse me, sir, excuse me, I would please
trouble you for one cup of water. The smallest thing in the world to ask
for, water. A man is dying and that is me.</p>
<p><strong>noel</strong>: For days I’ve eaten nothing but sand, O Lord,
I waited so long.</p>
<p><strong>hazmat</strong>: Christ. Who the hell woke him up?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Don’t give me that look.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: What look?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You know what I’m talking about. It’s all
over your face. That I-just- saved-a-little-baby-boy look.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: We just saved a little baby boy. Think of it
that way.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I don’t want to hear about it, okay? That’s
three jobs for the night. It’s over. Three jobs and time for a drink.
Six am, the cocktail hour. Pass the bottle; I know you’re holding.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: The bar is now open.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I hate vodka.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Please, a little decorum if you will. What I
was going to say is, is that holding that baby in my arms, I felt like I
was twenty-one again. A call like that makes me think of going back to
three nights a week, not two, start running again, cut down on the
drinking.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’ll drink to that.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Here’s to the greatest job in the world.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Greatest job in the world.</p>
<p><strong>dispatcher love</strong>: Twelve Young, I have priorities
holding. Pick up the radio.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Don’t do it, Marcus. Tell her the bus died,
our radio’s not working, our backs are out. Tell her we’re too drunk to
take any more calls.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Let’s do it! It’s Marcus, Love, only for
you.</p>
<p><strong>dispatcher love</strong>: Male diff breather, approximately
30, Houston and A.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Ten-four.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: I’m coming, Love! I’m coming!</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Where you going?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I quit! I’m through!</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: You can’t leave me now.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: So long, Noel.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What’s going on, Griss?</p>
<p><strong>griss</strong>: Your friend there just untied the water
beggar. Griss was coming out to thank her. Probably saved Griss a murder
charge. Having a tough time of it.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Excuse me. You seemed like you were in
trouble.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’m all right. I just can’t stand to see
people tied up. I’m in the waiting room for hours, listening to Noel
screaming. The only reason he’s screaming is ’cause he’s tied up.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Don’t seem so bad to me.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Don’t say that. I wanted to cut my father
loose too. They told me he almost died and five minutes later they say
he’s better and I go in. It’s killing me seeing him fighting like that.
Look, since you’re here, maybe you could do me a favor. I need you to
wait for me outside this building, okay? I have to visit a friend who’s
sick.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’m only asking because it’s a dangerous
building. There’s been some robberies, a woman was raped not long ago.
This woman I’m seeing, she’ll want to talk to me all day, but if I can
point to you out the window and say you’re waiting, I can be out quick.
if anything happens, I’ll be in apartment 16M.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Maybe I should come up with you.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: If I’m not back in fifteen minutes, hit the
buzzer. That way she’ll let me go.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Nothing’s going to happen. I’ll come with
you.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: No, I’ll be fine. I’m just visiting a sick
friend.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I shouldn’t have asked you to come.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You asked me not to come.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Promise you won’t go inside.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Fifteen minutes.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I just have to relax a little. Not feel so
guilty all the time.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: We can still go back. I’ll walk you home. You
sleep a couple of hours, watch some TV, take a bath.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Don’t be a cop. If you have any doubts about
this, it’s my fault.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You go on home, okay. I’m fine, really. I
don’t need you. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>kanita</strong>: Hey Cy, guess who’s here?</p>
<p><strong>coates</strong>: Mary …</p>
<p><strong>kanita</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Mary Burke. She’s a friend.</p>
<p><strong>kanita</strong>: She’s not here.</p>
<p><strong>kanita</strong>: Wait a minute. You can’t go in.</p>
<p><strong>coates</strong>: It’s okay, Kanita. Come on in.</p>
<p><strong>kanita</strong>: He looks like a cop.</p>
<p><strong>coates</strong>: He’s not a cop, he’s a medic. I’m CY
Coates.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Frank Pierce.</p>
<p><strong>coates</strong>: Mary said you might be coming.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>coates</strong>: Sleeping in the back.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: She asked me to pick her up.</p>
<p><strong>coates</strong>: I know, but she told me to tell you she
wants to crash here a few hours. Terrible about her father, isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I better just go in and see her.</p>
<p><strong>coates</strong>: I call this the Oasis. Refuge from the world
out there. Did you know two people were shot in this building last
week?</p>
<p><strong>coates</strong>: Careful. That’s the Tiger. The lady’s down
the hall. Welcome to Sunrise Enterprises, Frank, the stress-free
factory.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Mary. Mary, we’ve got to get going.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: No, no.</p>
<p><strong>coates</strong>: She wanted something to help her sleep.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Mary, we really have to go.</p>
<p><strong>coates</strong>: Frank, she’s suffered enough. She’s okay, I
promise. C’mon, Frank.</p>
<p><strong>coates</strong>: I’m always interested in people in stressful
occupations and being a paramedic is about as stressful as I can
imagine. Here, sit down. What’s it like? Tell me some war stories.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Got a beer?</p>
<p><strong>coates</strong>: That shit is poison, Frank. We don’t drink
alcohol here. What you need is one of these.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Did you give Mary something called Red
Death?</p>
<p><strong>coates</strong>: Red Death? Tell me something, Frank–does
killing your clients make good business sense to you? The kids selling
that shit have no sense. They’ll be taken care of, don’t worry about
that.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I should be going. I just quit.</p>
<p><strong>coates</strong>: Sleep is all stress reduction. Here. You
take one of these, sleep two hours, that’s all you need. Why do you
think I’m telling you this, Frank–for my health? You ought to look at
yourself in the mirror, man. Kanita, get him a glass of water.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Is this what you gave Mary?</p>
<p><strong>coates</strong>: That’s the stuff. I call it the Red Lion.
Very king-of-the-jungle.</p>
<p><strong>coates</strong>: Frank, I’m trying to help you. Drink up.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I guess I’ll be going.</p>
<p><strong>coates</strong>: Just take it easy.</p>
<p><strong>kanita</strong>: Take my pulse. It’s good, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Perfect.</p>
<p><strong>kanita</strong>: I knew it. I was wrong about you. You’re not
so bad.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: You’re in the stomach!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You sure?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Rose!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: My name. Rose.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: You’re in the stomach, man.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: You’re in the stomach! Let me try.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: One more time!</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Stomach again.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: No way!</p>
<p><strong>coates</strong>: Frank, take it easy. what happened?</p>
<p><strong>kanita</strong>: He flipped out.</p>
<p><strong>coates</strong>: Be cool, man. You’re having a paradoxical
reaction. It can happen. Didn’t I tell you this guy was stressed
out?</p>
<p><strong>kanita</strong>: Stressed? He’s psycho.</p>
<p><strong>coates</strong>: Frank, where you going?</p>
<p><strong>coates</strong>: You’re making a mistake. Sit down and relax
a minute.</p>
<p><strong>coates</strong>: She’ll be back. And, by the way, you owe me
ten bucks.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I can walk.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Let go of me. You shouldn’t have come up. I
told you not to. You could have gotten us both killed.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You and CY have a nice talk? He tell you about
Sunrise Enterprises, helping people? Well, I’ve seen him hurt people.
Why are you following me?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Because you can barely walk.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You remember Noel, from the other night, how
Noel is now? He wasn’t always like that. He was my brother’s best
friend. Cy or Tiger or one of those other goons put a bullet in Noel’s
head. He was in a coma three months. Crazy ever since.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: This is my place.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What is it? You want to help me, you feel
sorry for me? Keep it to yourself.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I need to sit down a minute.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Or maybe you wanna fuck me? Everyone else
has.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’ve been clean two years now. I got a job. I
paint when I’m home. Don’t bother anybody. Then all this shit
happens.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Oh no you don’t. You can’t stay here.</p>
<p><strong>fade in</strong>: a passing siren wakes Frank. He thinks
back, looking around the darkened room, realizes where he is. The dog
comes over, licks his hand.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Hello, I’m Frank. Mary’s friend. A very close
friend who loves animals.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I washed my face with three kinds of soap,
each smelling like a different season. It felt good to be in a woman’s
room again, especially a woman who wasn’t comatose or severely disabled.
I felt that perhaps I had turned a corner, like I saved someone, though
I didn’t know who.</p>
<p><strong>capt. barney</strong>: You’re late, Pierce. I know, but I
can’t fire you. I’ve got nobody to work sixteen XRay with Walls.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: No …</p>
<p><strong>capt. barney</strong>: I got some forms here to fill out
about that accident when you get the time. I’ll fire you tomorrow. I
promise.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What if there is no tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>capt. barney</strong>: Go on, get outta here, Pierce, before
I give you a big hug. I love this guy.</p>
<p><strong>walls</strong>: Frank, what do you know. It’s you and me
again tonight, the Rough Riders, tearing up the streets just like old
times. This old bus is a warrior, Frank, just like us. I have tried to
kill him and he will not die. I have a great respect for that.</p>
<p><strong>griss</strong>: Don’t make me take off my sunglasses.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Morning, Griss.</p>
<p><strong>nurse constance</strong>: We’re full up tonight, Frank.</p>
<p><strong>burke’s voice</strong>: Go to the bank, boy, take out
everything you can.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Mr. Burke?</p>
<p><strong>burke’s voice</strong>: I’m going. I’ve had enough.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You do it.</p>
<p><strong>milagros</strong>: Can’t reach. You’re taller.</p>
<p><strong>burke’s voice</strong>: Don’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I thought he was getting better.</p>
<p><strong>milagros</strong>: Technically, yeah. I suppose. It doesn’t
matter.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>milagros</strong>: Tha family wants us to do everything to
save him–so, that’s it. They want to keep him alive, they want to
believe in miracles, we keep him alive. Shock him, Frank. He’ll come
back. He always comes back.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Clear!</p>
<p><strong>burke’s voice</strong>: Ow!</p>
<p><strong>burke’s voice</strong>: You son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>milagros</strong>: Should I increase the lidocaine?</p>
<p><strong>walls</strong>: Frank, what you doing back there?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’m sick, Tom. I need a cure. Vitamin B
cocktail, followed by an amp of glucose and a drop of adrenaline. Not as
good as beer, but all I got.</p>
<p><strong>walls</strong>: Come on, Frank. There’s blood spilling in the
streets.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: These are hard times, Tom.</p>
<p><strong>walls</strong>: Yeah. Great, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Great to be drunk. Sobriety’s killing me.</p>
<p><strong>walls</strong>: Look up, Frank. Full moon. The blood’s gonna
run tonight. I can feel it. Our mission: to save lives.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Our mission is coffee, Tom. A shot of the
bull, Puerto Rican espresso.</p>
<p><strong>walls</strong>: Ten-four. El Toro de Oro. Blast off.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: The cure’s not working, Tom. Maybe we should
go back to the hospital.</p>
<p><strong>walls</strong>: Don’t worry, kid. Tom’ll take care of you.
Put your head out the window, get some of that summer air. Listen to the
music. El Toro de Oro. Andale. Pronto.</p>
<p><strong>dispatcher</strong>: Okay, units, it’s suicide hour. Fourteen
Boy, I show you in the hospital sixty minutes but I know you’re in the
diner on 14th. Put down the burger, I got a call for you around the
corner, 14 and 3rd, a man with a noose around his neck and nothing to
hang it on. Sixteen XRay, don’t even think about getting coffee, I have
a call for you too.</p>
<p><strong>walls</strong>: Sixteen XTerminator here. We like our coffee
bloody. Make it good–my partner’s dying to help someone.</p>
<p><strong>dispatcher</strong>: You’re in luck, X: your patient awaits
you with bleeding wrists on Avenue C and Fourth.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Tom, where are the Band-aids? This is an
ambulance, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>walls</strong>: Look out!</p>
<p><strong>walls</strong>: What the hell’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>drunk #1</strong>: You’ve gotta take him to the hospital. He
tried to kill himself. Show him your wrist. Show A.</p>
<p><strong>drunk #1</strong>: See, he ain’t right.</p>
<p><strong>walls</strong>: Hold it. I will not take anyone anywhere
against his will. This is America. People have rights.</p>
<p><strong>drunk #2</strong>: He was bleeding before. He kept spilling
his beer. I gave him mouth- to-mouth.</p>
<p><strong>walls</strong>: You’re lucky you didn’t kill him. We’re going
to hear it straight from the loony’s mouth. Are you crazy? Did you try
to bump yourself off?</p>
<p><strong>cut wrists</strong>: Yesssss.</p>
<p><strong>walls</strong>: Why didn’t you say so.</p>
<p><strong>walls</strong>: Sir, I am going to give you some medicine
that is still very experimental. It’s from NASA, and although the
astronauts have been using it for years, we are the first service to try
it. I will put this patch on your forehead like this, and in about a
minute you will have to relax. You will forget all your suicidal
feelings. It’s very important that you wear this for a least twenty-
four hours and keep checking the mirror. If the patch turns green you
have to see the doctor immediately. The side effects could be fatal.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: This is the worst suicide attempt I’ve ever
seen. You feel the pulse? Here. That’s where you cut, and it’s not
across, it’s down like so. Here take it.</p>
<p><strong>cut wrists</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: With all the poor people of this city who
wanted only to live and were viciously murdered, you have the nerve to
sit here waiting to die and not go through with it. You make me sick.
Take it.</p>
<p><strong>walls</strong>: We cured him, Frank. When we work together
there’s nothing we can’t fix.</p>
<p><strong>walls</strong>: Sounds like they’re trying to clean up the
bus terminal tonight,</p>
<p><strong>walls</strong>: Hello, hello. Major Tom to Frank, time to
come home.</p>
<p><strong>walls</strong>: Where you going?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: C’mon, Tom. The city’s burning.</p>
<p><strong>walls</strong>: Whatja doing?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I feel the need, the need for speed. I’m
driving out of myself.</p>
<p><strong>walls</strong>: The brakes are shot.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’ve taken that into consideration.</p>
<p><strong>walls</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I never felt better in my life.</p>
<p><strong>dispatcher</strong>: Sixteen XRay, XRay.</p>
<p><strong>dispatcher</strong>: First of all, I want you to know how
sorry I am about this. I’ve always liked you two. A unit above none, a
legend in its own lunchtime, so it hurts me deeply to do this but I have
no choice. You must go to Second and St. Marks. In front of a liquor
store you’ll find a forty year-old male, unconscious, lying next to his
wheelchair. Do I have to say more?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You’ve said too much already.</p>
<p><strong>walls</strong>: Mr. Oh.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It’s early for him.</p>
<p><strong>walls</strong>: That’s all right, we’re not meant to do Oh
tonight. Something is going to happen. I can feel it.</p>
<p><strong>walls</strong>: Bingo. EMS to Central. What was that
call?</p>
<p><strong>police dispatch</strong>: A jumper. Stuyvesant Town.</p>
<p><strong>walls</strong>: Ten-four. One minute out.</p>
<p><strong>dispatcher</strong>: Sixteen, Sixteen XRay. Level One
Emergency.</p>
<p><strong>walls</strong>: Whadda we bring?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Better bring it all.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: The elevator’s fucked. We’d never all fit
anyway. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>fireman</strong>: That’s thirteen flights.</p>
<p><strong>walls</strong>: The news guys just pulled up.</p>
<p><strong>police sergeant</strong>: The stairs, men, the stairs.</p>
<p><strong>walls</strong>: This guy a jumper?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: We got a call for shots fired on the sixteenth
floor. The jumper called right after.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’m going to sixteen.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: That’s it, nobody else home.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’m going to thirteen.</p>
<p><strong>walls</strong>: Get this, Frank–we got two patients. Number
one, the scarecrow outside. Number two misses the railing but breaks
both legs on the balcony, then throws himself through a glass window,
heads to the bedroom, where he’s now passed out.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Well, he’s the steakhead of the night,
then.</p>
<p><strong>walls</strong>: I don’t think the fire people can touch him
out there.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: How’s he doing?</p>
<p><strong>walls</strong>: I haven’t had a chance to see him yet. I’m
going to take care of sleeping beauty.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Does that hurt?</p>
<p><strong>coates</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I don’t think you’ve hurt any major organs.
We got to get you off this thing without setting off bleeding.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: They’re gonna torch the fence. You’re gonna
feel the metal getting warm, maybe very warm.</p>
<p><strong>coates</strong>: I can’t hold up my head anymore.</p>
<p><strong>coates</strong>: So, Frank, am I going to live?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You’re going to live.</p>
<p><strong>coates</strong>: I’ve been thinking about things. Meditating
on my financial future. You guys gave me plenty of time to meditate on
the future. Whatja do, stop for Chinese on the way over? There’s plenty
of food in my place.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I was tired. I needed a coffee.</p>
<p><strong>coates</strong>: What about Kanita?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Dead.</p>
<p><strong>coates</strong>: That’s too bad. Get some money, a nice
looking girl on your arm, and everyone wants to take a piece. Some kid I
wouldn’t let wash my Mercedes is in my house, shooting at me. Damn, I
thought I could make it onto the balcony like Tiger. He’s fat, that’s
why, falls faster. I’m trying to watch my weight, and look what happens.
Am I shot, Frank?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>coates</strong>: Boy can’t shoot for shit, either. Goddamn
that’s hot.</p>
<p><strong>coates</strong>: Isn’t it beautiful? When the fires start to
fall, then the strongest rule it all. I love this city.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Good thing we buckled you in, huh?</p>
<p><strong>coates</strong>: What about me? Who’s supposed to buckle
me?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: I thought you did.</p>
<p><strong>2nd cop</strong>: I thought you did.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: I’m so sorry, sir.</p>
<p><strong>hazmat</strong>: Nurse Crupp, we’re going to need some Valium
here. He’s waking up again.</p>
<p><strong>hazmat</strong>: Where’s that Valium?</p>
<p><strong>burke’s voice</strong>: Don’t. Don’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>hazmat</strong>: Give me a hand, Frank. I’ve got to get
something between those teeth.</p>
<p><strong>hazmat</strong>: You can’t believe how much he’s
improved.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: How many times have you shocked him
tonight?</p>
<p><strong>hazmat</strong>: Fourteen. We finally got him a room
upstairs. Should be up there in a couple of hours.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What do you do, just have someone follow him
around with a defribilator?</p>
<p><strong>hazmat</strong>: That’s good, Frank. No, but they might
surgically implant one, about the size of my thumb. It goes near the
shoulder here, with two electrodes connected to the heart. It sends a
shock whenever it senses a drop in blood flow. Amazing, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: A medical miracle.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Everyone, this is the medic who brought my
father in. Frank, these are some of my father’s friends.</p>
<p><strong>family friend</strong>: We live out an the Island now, but we
used to live right down the block from Pat. He was like a saint to us.
Came as soon as we heard.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’m going out for a smoke.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I heard CY Coates was brought in. He looked
pretty bad.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: He’ll be all right.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Too bad. He called me up today, can you
believe that? I don’t know how he got my number. He asks me do I want to
come over and see him, I tell him I’d rather go to a leper colony. He
says there’s a new gang that wants to kill him, take over the business.
I told him I hope he’s right. That they kill him. That’s what I told
him.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It’ll be a while before he’s up and running
again.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: OK, last night I was weak. it won’t happen
again. And all that shit I said–it was just because I was stoned. Forget
it.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: No problem. Thanks for letting me crash. It
was the best sleep I’ve had in months. I used some of your soap.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I wish these people would leave already. I
can’t listen to another story. Did you see him? That doctor says the
brain is coming around. They’re waiting for the heart to stabilize. I
don’t know who to believe. He says they still have to keep him tied
up.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Can I bring you something back to eat–a
falafal, some pizza?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: No, we just ate. I only remember how tough my
father was. Now I know he had to be like that, to make us tough. This
city’ll kill you if you aren’t strong enough.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: No, the city doesn’t discriminate. It gets
everybody.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I gotta go. Another call.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: We’re all dying, Mary Burke.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: This is not a good time.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: There’s no time.</p>
<p><strong>inxs</strong>: “The Devil Inside.”</p>
<p><strong>walls</strong>: Get ready, Frank. Missed a drug shooting
while you were dicking around in there. There’s gonna be trauma
tonight!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: As long as we keep moving. No standing
still.</p>
<p><strong>walls</strong>: C’mon, look at your screen. Give up some
blood!</p>
<p><strong>dispatcher</strong>: Sixteen XRay, a man at the bus terminal
shot three years ago says his arm hurts.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: C’mon, Tom, pick up a job.</p>
<p><strong>walls</strong>: You want some bum in the bus terminal? We’ll
wait for a real call.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Let’s get in a fight, then.</p>
<p><strong>walls</strong>: Who with?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: That’s your job. Just keep driving, keep
moving. No stopping. We’re sharks. We stop too long, we die.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Let’s break something, Tom. Let’s bust
something, bomb something.</p>
<p><strong>walls</strong>: What do you want to break?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I don’t know–let’s break some windows.</p>
<p><strong>walls</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Destruction, distraction. I feel the
need.</p>
<p><strong>walls</strong>: You need a reason, Frank. You don’t just go
around breaking people’s windows. That’s anarchy.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What’s the reason? Give me a reason, Tom.</p>
<p><strong>walls</strong>: Let me think.</p>
<p><strong>walls</strong>: Classic cabbie move. Hey, swammy, that’s
called a crosswalk. You stop before it, not on it!</p>
<p><strong>walls</strong>: I know who to work over. Him.</p>
<p><strong>walls</strong>: This guy’s been terrorizing the neighborhood
for weeks, ever since he got outta jail, wreaking general havoc,
contributing to the bad name of the place. The term “menace to society”
was made up for him.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: He’s crazy. He can’t help it.</p>
<p><strong>walls</strong>: Well, why don’t they put him away? Prisons
don’t want him. I took him to the hospital yesterday and here he is
again.</p>
<p><strong>walls</strong>: Look at that. Tell me that’s a crazy person.
Every move is calculated. He knows exactly what he’s doing. This is the
guy. I’ve been after him for weeks. He’s quick, runs like a rat, tough
for one person, but with two of us–</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Okay, whatta I do?</p>
<p><strong>walls</strong>: If he sees me, he’ll run, so I’ll get out
here. You start talking to him about baseball or something while I sneak
around behind and get down and you push him. When he falls we get
him.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: That’s ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>walls</strong>: Believe me, it always works. The simpler, the
better.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You learn that in the army?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Flatbush.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: That’s a hell of a swing you got there, Noel.
I’m thinking Strawberry in his prime.</p>
<p><strong>noel</strong>: Strawberry ain’t shit. Drug pussy. Me. I swing
like Reggie. Mr. October. Number three, game six, World Series.</p>
<p><strong>noel</strong>: Here, you try.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: No, I’d better not.</p>
<p><strong>noel</strong>: Sure, sure, give go.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What the hell. The next year, tiebreaker for
the division, in Boston, Yanks down two to nothing, Bucky Dent steps to
the plate.</p>
<p><strong>noel</strong>: Oh man, Bucky.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: The pitch, high heater. Bucky knows what’s
coming. He steps in, smash, over the green monster.</p>
<p><strong>walls</strong>: Frank, what the hell are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>walls</strong>: You go down those stairs there. Meet me back
here if you can’t find him in ten minutes. Call out if you see him. Get
with the program, Frank.</p>

<p><strong>floor nurse</strong>: He coded.</p>
<p><strong>hazmat</strong>: Christ, what a way to start the day. He’s in
V-fib. Shock him.</p>
<p><strong>floor nurse</strong>: Clear!</p>
<p><strong>hazmat</strong>: Zap him again.</p>
<p><strong>hazmat</strong>: Nothing. Get the cart, start compressions,
get an epinephrine in.</p>
<p><strong>hazmat</strong>: That’s enough. I called it. Let’s get some
coffee. You gonna tell the family?</p>
<p><strong>walls</strong>: Die!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Frank.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Come on up.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: He’s dead, Rose. Your father passed.</p>
<p><strong>rose/mary</strong>: How can that be? He was getting
better.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: He coded. They shocked him one too many
times. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>rose/mary</strong>: He was tough. You did all you could.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>rose/mary</strong>: You have to keep the body going until the
brain and heart recover enough to go on their own.</p>
