<h1 id="the-goonies-2">the-goonies-2</h1>
<p><strong>passenger#1</strong>: Ah… maybe this wasn’t a good idea. I
think that I…</p>
<p><strong>pirate#1</strong>: Ah, ne’r ye mind. Capn’s always lookin’
fer fresh meat. Er, new blood.</p>
<p><strong>pirate#2</strong>: Yeah… ‘sides, who wouldn’t wanna’ be
parta’ the fiercest crew afloat? Hmm?</p>
<p><strong>pirate#1</strong>: Don’ fall… wouldn’t want ye ta feed the
sharks a’for meetin the cap’n.</p>
<p><strong>passenger#2</strong>: Sh-sharks?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Welcome aboard the Inferno. 2. In an instant,
we see his left side… and the decorated patch covering his left eye.
ONE-EYED WILLY. He is in his mid-30’s and doesn’t look like your typical
idea of a pirate except for the eye patch. He is clean-shaven and speaks
very well.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I hear that you wish to become pirates. That
true?</p>
<p><strong>passenger#1</strong>: Yes… We do, sir.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Fine. Then pirates you are. Just not aboard
<i>this</i> ship until you accomplish one thing.</p>
<p><strong>passenger#1</strong>: J-just <i>one</i> thing? What
"thing"?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: The Gauntlet.</p>
<p><strong>passenger#2</strong>: What is the "gauntlet"?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Oh… nothing really. Just a test.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: A simple test to see if you have what it
takes to become a member of my elite crew of "ruthless barbarians". All
you have to do is retrieve a sword for me. That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Unfortunately for you two, the weapons are
located BENEATH the Inferno. Attached to the centermost point of her
lovely hull are your keys back onto the ship. One for each of you. Bring
them to me, and you shall reap the benefits of all that I have to
offer.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Oh. There is a rope ladder at the stern of
the ship. If you still have an arm left by then, please feel free to use
it.</p>
<p><strong>pirate#3</strong>: Uh-uh! Ye ain’t finished yet… ye gotta’
get ta’ the ship!</p>
<p><strong>pirate#1</strong>: Ye better jump, flea!</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Well, men… it appears that we have a new
shipmate!</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Someone attend to his leg! We don’t need
another damn peg leg aboard!</p>
<p><strong>passenger#1</strong>: How many have… 5. WILLY Huh? Speak up,
mate!</p>
<p><strong>passenger#1</strong>: How… How many have made it though that
alive?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: None! You are the first, Matey. Not too easy,
was it?</p>
<p><strong>messenger</strong>: They ’re almost upon us. A ship just
pulled into port and said they passed ’em on the way in. A DAY’S travel!
THEY ARE ALMOST HERE!</p>
<p><strong>pirate#1</strong>: Ye said we had <u>weeks</u>, Cap’n!</p>
<p><strong>pirate#2</strong>: Yeah! Wha’ happened? We…</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: ENOUGH! The English have gained on us sooner
than I had planned, but all is not yet lost. Close it up… NOW! We are
leaving!</p>
<p><strong>pirate#1</strong>: But Cap’n… there are MEN down there!</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I don’t care! Let God worry about them – Not
me.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: And get that man a change of clothes. He’s a
welcome addition to the crew!</p>
<p><strong>pirate#2</strong>: Cap’n? Anything?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>pirate#1</strong>: Cap’n! They says there’s a cave aroun’ the
bend a bit! Can barely be seen from the nest…</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>pirate#1</strong>: We was thinkin’ that we could pull the
Inferno inside. You know, so…</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Big enough for her, eh? Hmmm. If they pass
by, we can swing around behind her… Aye. DO IT! NOW!</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Cut her as close to the shore as ye can! We
need to make it in before they can see around the bend! MOVE, fer God’s
sake, MOVE! Man the hand lead and lines!</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Good afternoon, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Uh, Sir that is not for sale. It’s only a
display…</p>
<p><strong>chester</strong>: Twenty-Five thousand.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>chester</strong>: Twenty-Five thousand. Cash.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: F-For those…?</p>
<p><strong>chester</strong>: Each.</p>
<p><strong>tami</strong>: Hi, Babe… Oh, sorry.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: I, uh, can’t. Did you say… "Each"?</p>
<p><strong>chester</strong>: I will pay you fifty thousand dollars cash
for these two pieces.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: No. No, I can’t. They’re special – we went
though a lot together.</p>
<p><strong>tami</strong>: Mike…</p>
<p><strong>chester</strong>: Mr. Walsh, EVERYTHING has a price. What do
you need from me to make us BOTH happy? Just say a number.</p>
<p><strong>tami</strong>: Mikey…</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: No. I’m sorry, they are not for sale.</p>
<p><strong>tami</strong>: Uh, Mr… let me talk to him. He’s just…</p>
<p><strong>tami</strong>: Mikey, do you realize what we could do with
that money? We…</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Yes, Tam. I know. Those aren’t really mine to
sell. They were a gift from a VERY old friend.</p>
<p><strong>tami</strong>: You know that they have treatments for
obsessive-compulsive disorder, right? Ok, Mr. You win. You get to keep
your trinkets. We can squalor in poverty for now.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Whatcha’ got, Buzz? Any hacksaws today?</p>
<p><strong>inmate</strong>: Yeah, but I just gave the last one away to
someone who knows how to use it.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Oh, that hurt. Just gimme’ my paper.</p>
<p><strong>guard1</strong>: What the hell’s this shit? The "Astoria
Times Delta"? How cute… Why do YOU care what goes on in Astoria – ain’t
like you’re ever gonna’ go back, Jake.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I like to read the obituaries… hoping I might
find someone I know.</p>
<p><strong>guard1</strong>: Oh, yeah… ain’t that the section where I
found your mother’s picture? Geez, you’d think she could at least crack
a smile.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You son-of-a-bitch! I’ll get YOUR damn picture
in the paper… she died in PRISON. I didn’t even get a chance to see
her!</p>
<p><strong>guard1</strong>: Kill a federal agent, and you deserve to die
in the CHAIR. Not a prison cell. She got lucky. Tell your brother I send
my regards. I heard he’s been raked over so many times now that he’s
gotta’ wear Diapers.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You’ve got mail.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: All Right! He’s gettin’ married!</p>
<p><strong>mouth</strong>: Clarke Devereaux here.</p>
<p><strong>stef</strong>: Mikey’s getting married! In Astoria!</p>
<p><strong>mouth</strong>: Whoa, whoa… Mikey WALSH? Shit, you sure,
Babe?</p>
<p><strong>stef</strong>: Of course I’m sure, Dork. Why would I say that
if I wasn’t sure? I have the invitation right here!</p>
<p><strong>mouth</strong>: I <i>love</i> when you call me names, Stef.
13. He is on his Cellular phone, and surrounded by election signs
covered with his name and picture. He is running for public office. A
lady walks up and shakes his hand while he is on the phone.</p>
<p><strong>mouth</strong>: When’s the wedding?</p>
<p><strong>stef</strong>: You have to wait until you get HOME to find
out. Soon I hope?</p>
<p><strong>mouth</strong>: You wanna’ get all "Demi Moore" with the clay
again? I should be home in a bit, Stef Yeah, I love you too.</p>
<p><strong>mouth</strong>: Wow… Mikey. Married.</p>
<p><strong>student</strong>: Lawrence! You got a letter here… looks kind
of strange. LAWRENCE!</p>
<p><strong>chunk</strong>: Yeah? What is it?</p>
<p><strong>student</strong>: Weird, man. Looks like an invitation or
something.</p>
<p><strong>student</strong>: What the hell does "Chunk" mean?</p>
<p><strong>student</strong>: What a freak.</p>
<p><strong>brand</strong>: Hey, everyone! My brothers getting
married!</p>
<p><strong>worker#1</strong>: "You lover’s getting carried?" What the
hell does THAT mean, Brand?</p>
<p><strong>brand</strong>: No… My…</p>
<p><strong>brand</strong>: My BROTHER’S getting MARRIED!</p>
<p><strong>worker#2</strong>: And you’re <i>happy</i>?</p>
<p><strong>worker#1</strong>: Poor bastard.</p>
<p><strong>worker#3</strong>: Sorry, Bud. Better him than you.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>stef</strong>: What is it with you people? Chunk was the one
who made up stories… not me. Of course I am sure. I have the invitation
right here.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Wow. It almost feels surreal. What’s her
name?</p>
<p><strong>stef</strong>: Tami. Cute. I didn’t even know he was dating
anyone.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Do you… do you think Brand will be there?</p>
<p><strong>stef</strong>: Duh. It’s his brother. Of course he will be
there. Why? Uh-Oh… A coal still burning in the fire? I thought you were
living with that prissy model guy, Jason.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Well… It’s a long story. He was just the short
version of it. Everyone seems so… Boring.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Oh, crap. Gotta’ go, Stef.</p>
<p><strong>stef</strong>: Call me…</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I will!</p>
<p><strong>guard1</strong>: Pssst. Hey, Dirtbag.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Yeah, yeah? Who… the hell? I didn’t do
nothin’! I –</p>
<p><strong>guard1</strong>: Get up, you’re coming with us. Now.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Look, Man. I’m OK with you sayin’ crap about
my Mom. Say whatever you want –</p>
<p><strong>guard1</strong>: Shut the Hell up, Jake. You have 30 seconds,
or I am going to walk out of here without you.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: So… all I have to do is lay here and you’ll
leave?</p>
<p><strong>guard1</strong>: You don’t WANT me to leave without you.
Trust me.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What’s this about?</p>
<p><strong>guard1</strong>: The warden wants to see you.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: In the middle of the night? Gimme’ a break.
You guys planing on shooting me? Saying that I was trying to escape
–</p>
<p><strong>guard2</strong>: Jeezus. Are you for real?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’ve seen the movies. You guys always pull
that kind of shit.</p>
<p><strong>guard1</strong>: Oh, and by that theory… all prisoners are
actually innocent, right?</p>
<p><strong>guard1</strong>: Need one of us to stay with you?</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: That will not be needed. Go about your
business and have a good night.</p>
<p><strong>guard1</strong>: You need us to check back in? To take this
scumbag back to his…</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Uh, Warden. I ain’t been causin’ no problems,
Sir.</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: Mr. Fratelli.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: …and I’m actually kinda tired too. Gotta’ get
ready for my parole board hearing next Thursday.</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: Jake. There isn’t going to BE a parole
hearing.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: I…I didn’t do anything! Come on, guys. Jus’
let me go back to my cell. Please? PLEASE?</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: Enough!</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Warden… I…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Francis? Francis!</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Wha? Jake? That you?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: It’s good to see you, Bud.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Why the hell are you lettin’ them push you
around, Francis? Huh? What would Ma think?</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: Save the reunion festivities for later,
won’t you? We are here to work out some details.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Huh? For what? What is this, Jake?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I dunno. Warden… what did you mean? I’m not
havin’ a hearing?</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: Do you really think they are ever going to
let you out, Jake? Seriously?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Sure. I have…</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: No. They won’t. Roaches like yourselves are
destined to scurry in the halls of prison your entire lives. Sure. You
may see the light of day, but you always come home to nest.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: However, there are other ways out of this
uh, "Roach Motel". Can I interest you in an open door?</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Wait. We been here for over fifteen years
without ever talkin’ with you… sides’ our introduction the first day.
Now…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: …You’re our best friend? Like I asked before,
you guys setting us up?</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Oh, I’m not your friend. Never confuse that
with what we are talking about here. I would just as soon shoot you as
feed you. You two are nothing besides green to line my pockets with. If
it weren’t for money, we wouldn’t be here talking.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: We don’t have any money, Warden.</p>
<p><strong>chester</strong>: Yes, but gentlemen… I do.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Who the Hell?</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: You two have only one chance.</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: Knowing how stupid you two are, I know one
isn’t enough. But one it is. Your friend here – Um, OUR friend here –
has made me happy. Happy enough to chance several things on you. You
blow this, and I report you as escaped. I guarantee that I can put
together a manhunt big enough to scrape you from whatever shoe you try
to hide under. You do what he asks – and then quietly disappear when you
are done… and these files are filed away permanently. With my signature.
Nobody will ask questions that I can’t answer.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: This ain’t no trick?</p>
<p><strong>chester</strong>: No. Do exactly as I ask, and you two will
be free men within a week.</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: That is a scary thought.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What’s the catch?</p>
<p><strong>chester</strong>: No catch really. You just have to promise
me that I will have your undivided attention and commitment for the next
week. No questions asked.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: No problem! You got it… What are we doing?
Housework? Cleaning your car? Driving you around…</p>
<p><strong>chester</strong>: You may actually enjoy this. One last job…
finishing up something that you had already started.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: All it’s gonna’ to cost us is one week?</p>
<p><strong>chester</strong>: Gentlemen, it may end up costing you your
lives.</p>
<strong>warden</strong>: We can only hope!</font></tt>
