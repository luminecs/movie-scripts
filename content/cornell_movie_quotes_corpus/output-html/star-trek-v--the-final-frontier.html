<p><strong>nimbus iii</strong>: IN THE NEUTRAL ZONE</p>
<p><strong>rider</strong>: I thought weapons were forbidden on this
planet.</p>
<p><strong>rider</strong>: Besides, I can’t believe you’d kill me for a
field of empty holes.</p>
<p><strong>j’onn</strong>: It’s all I have.</p>
<p><strong>rider</strong>: Your pain runs deep.</p>
<p><strong>j’onn</strong>: What do you know of my pain?</p>
<p><strong>rider</strong>: Let us explore it together.</p>
<p><strong>rider</strong>: Each man hides a secret pain. It must be
exposed and reckoned with. It must be dragged from darkness and forced
into the light. Share your pain. Share your pain with me and gain
strength from the sharing.</p>
<p><strong>j’onn</strong>: Where did you get this power?</p>
<p><strong>rider</strong>: The power was within you.</p>
<p><strong>j’onn</strong>: I feel as if a weight has been lifted from my
heart. How can I repay you for this miracle?</p>
<p><strong>rider</strong>: Join my quest.</p>
<p><strong>j’onn</strong>: What is it you seek?</p>
<p><strong>rider</strong>: What you seek. What all men have sought since
time began - ultimate knowledge. But to find it we’ll need a
starship.</p>
<p><strong>j’onn</strong>: A starship? There are no starships on Nimbus
III.</p>
<p><strong>rider</strong>: Perhaps I have a way to bring one here.</p>
<p><strong>j’onn</strong>: But how?</p>
<p><strong>rider</strong>: Have faith, my friend. There are more of us
than you know.</p>
<p><strong>j’onn</strong>: You’re a Vulcan.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Greetings, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Spock - What are you doing in this neck of the
woods?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I’m flattered. Twelve hundred points of
interest in Yosemite and you pick me.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I regret to inform you that the record for
free-climbing El Captain is in no danger of being broken.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I’m not trying to break any records. I’m doing
this because I enjoy it. Not to mention the most important reason for
climbing a mountain…</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: And that is?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Because it’s there.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Ah, Captain?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: MM.?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I do not think you realize the gravity of
your situation.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: On the contrary. Gravity is foremost on my
mind. Look, I’m trying to make an ascent here. Why don’t you go pester
Dr McCoy for a while?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I believe Dr McCoy is not in the best of
moods.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Concentration is vital. You must be one with
the rock.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Spock, I appreciate your concern, but if you
don’t stop distracting me, I’m liable to be one…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Oh, God</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Perhaps “because it is there” is not
sufficient reason for climbing a mountain.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I’m hardly in a position to disagree.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Hello, Bones. Mind if we drop in for
dinner?</p>
<p><strong>television announcer’s voice</strong>: …your dream can become
a reality… the Paradise Inn…lots to choose from. We at the Paradise Inn
attempt to create the closest thing to paradise in Paradise City, that
is…</p>
<p><strong>caithlin</strong>: Gentlemen, I’m Caithlin Dar.</p>
<p><strong>talbot</strong>: Ah, yes. Our new Romulan representative.
Welcome to Paradise City, my dear, capital of the so-called “Planet of
Galactic Peace.” I’m St John Talbot, the Federation representative here
on Nimbus III. My charming companion here is the Klingon consul,
Korrd…</p>
<p><strong>caithlin</strong>: I expect that’s Klingon for hello.</p>
<p><strong>talbot</strong>: Won’t you come in, my dear?</p>
<p><strong>caithlin</strong>: Twenty years ago, our three governments
agree to develop this planet together.</p>
<p><strong>korrd</strong>: Hmmm…</p>
<p><strong>caithlin</strong>: A new age was born.</p>
<p><strong>talbot</strong>: Our new age has died a quick death. And the
settlers we conned into coming here - they were the dregs of the galaxy.
They immediately took to fighting amongst themselves. We forbade them
weapons and they soon began to fashion their own.</p>
<p><strong>caithlin</strong>: Well then, it appears I’ve arrived just in
time.</p>
<p><strong>korrd</strong>: Mmmm…</p>
<p><strong>television announcer’s voice</strong>: ….we have spared no
expense to create the closest thing to….</p>
<p><strong>j’onn</strong>: Get away from that transmitter!</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: Romulan. Terran. Klingon. Consider yourselves
my prisoners.</p>
<p><strong>talbot</strong>: Prisoners? We’re already prisoners on this
worthless lump of rock. What possible value could we be to you?</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: Nimbus III may be a worthless lump of rock,
but it does have one unique treasure. It’s the only place in the entire
galaxy that has the three of you.</p>
<p><strong>caithlin</strong>: I don’t know who you are or what you want
but I can tell you this: our governments will stop at nothing to insure
our safety.</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: That’s exactly what I’m counting on.</p>
<p><strong>scotty’s voice</strong>: U.S.S. Enterprise, shakedown cruise
report. I think this new ship was put together by monkeys. She’s got a
fine engine, but half the doors won’t open. And guess whose job it is to
make it right?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Borgus Frat.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: “Let’s see what she’s got,” said the
Captain. And then we found out, didn’t we?</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: I know you’ll whip her into shape, Scotty.
You always do.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Uhura, I thought you were on leave.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: And I thought we were supposed to be going
together.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Oh, I cannot leave her now when she needs me
the most.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: I had a feeling you would say something like
that. So I brought us dinner.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Oh, lassie, you’re the most understanding
woman I know.</p>
<p><strong>computer voice</strong>: Red, Red, Red Alert. Red Alert. Red,
Red, Red Alert.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: I just fixed that damn thing.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Turn it off, will you?</p>
<p><strong>command voice</strong>: Red Alert. Red Alert. This is a Red
Alert. Enterprise acknowledge.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: This is Enterprise. Identify yourself.</p>
<p><strong>command voice</strong>: Enterprise, this is Starfleet. We
have a Priority Seven situation in the Neutral Zone.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Stand by Starfleet. Scotty, this is for
real.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: They can’t be serious. The ship’s in pieces
and we’ve less than a skeleton aboard.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Starfleet, are you aware of our currant
status?</p>
<p><strong>command voice</strong>: Currant status understood. Stand by
to copy operational orders and recall key personnel.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Admit it. We’re lost.</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: All right, we’re lost. But we’re making good
time.</p>
<p><strong>uhura’s voice</strong>: Commander Sulu, come in, please.</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: I don’t believe this. Commander Sulu here.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Bad news, gentlemen. Shore leave’s been
cancelled.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Rescued at last.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Return to prearranged coordinates for
pickup.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Don’t tell them you’re lost. You’ll never
live it down.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Is there a problem, gentlemen?</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Um… yes. We’ve been caught in a blizzard!</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: And we can’t see a thing. Request you direct
us to the coordinates.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: My visual says sunny skies and seventy
degrees.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Sulu! Look! The sun’s come out! It’s a
miracle!</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Don’t worry, fellas. Your secret’s` safe with
me. I’ll send the shuttlecraft to pick you up.</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Uhura, I owe you one. Sulu out.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Knock it.. knock it… Bones… Bones.. knock it
off. We’re right here. And we’re starving.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Bi-podal seeds, Doctor?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: In that case, I have little choice but to
sample your… beans.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Mmmm. Surprisingly good. It does have a
flavoring I’m not familiar with.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: You got any more of that secret ingredient,
Bones?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Am I to understand that your secret
ingredient is.. alcohol?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Bourbon and beans, an explosive combination.
Think Spock can handle it?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: As you are so fond of pointing out, Doctor, I
am half human.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Ahhh.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: What did I do?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: It crossed my mind.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: And, even as I fell, I knew I wouldn’t
die.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Oh, no. It isn’t that. I knew I wouldn’t die
because the two of you were with me.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I’ve always known… I’ll die alone.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Other people, Bones. Not us.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I am preparing to toast a marsh melon.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Before leaving the ship, I consulted the
computer library to familiarize myself with the customs associated with
“camping out.”</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: We consume them.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Oh. I believe we are required to engage in a
ritual known as the singalong.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: That’s great. I haven’t sung around a campfire
since I was a boy in Iowa. What are we going to sing? What… Bones, what
are we going to sing?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: “Pack Up Your Troubles.”</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Are we leaving, Captain?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: “Moon Over Rigel Seven?”</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: “Row, row, row your boat…” I love “Row…” Do -
do you know “Row, Row, Row, Row, Row Your Boat?”</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: That song did not come up in my research,
Captain.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: The lyrics are - are very simple. It’s, er,
“Row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream. Merrily, merrily,
merrily, merrily, life is but a dream..” The Doctor and I will start it
off, and then when we give you the signal, you jump in. Doctor, if you
please.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Come on, Spock. Why didn’t you jump in?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I was trying to comprehend the meaning of the
words.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Oh. I am sorry, Doctor. Were we having a good
time?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: All right, all right, let’s call it a night,
will ya?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Let’s go to bed and just let’s get some
sleep.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Captain?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Spock, we’re on leave. You can call me
Jim.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Jim.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Yes, Spock?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Life is not a dream.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Go to sleep, Spock.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Yes, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Goodnight, Bones.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Goodnight, Spock.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Goodnight, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Goodnight, Jim.</p>

<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Mr. Scott apologizes for having to send the
shuttlecraft. The transporter beam is non-operational. Captain, we’ve
received important orders from Starlet Command.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Why didn’t you beep my communicator?</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: ER… You forgot to take it with you.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Oh. I wonder why I did that? Well, gentlemen,
it appears shore leave has been cancelled. Pack out your trash.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: “… all I ask is a tall ship and a star to

<p><strong>spock</strong>: John Masefield.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I am well-versed in the classics, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>uhura’s voice</strong>: Ready for landing. Enterprise, you
have control.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: We’re doing just fine.</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: All I can say is that they don’t make them
like they used to.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: You told me you could have the ship
operational in two weeks. I gave you three. What Happened?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: I think you gave me too much time,
Captain.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Very well, Mr. Scott. Carry on.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Aye, Captain How many times do I have to
tell you? The right tool for the right job…</p>
<p><strong>elevator voice</strong>: Level.. level.. level..?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Bridge. I hope.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I could use a shower.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Yes.</p>

<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Can we have a little quiet, please?</p>

<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Can you clear that up?</p>
<p><strong>commander’s voice</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Can we have it quiet?</p>
<p><strong>commanders image</strong>: Enterprise, this is Starfleet
Operations. Come in.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Bob?</p>
<p><strong>commanders image</strong>: Jim…? Well, we’re dressing
informally, aren’t we?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: You caught me on my way to the shower.</p>
<p><strong>commanders image</strong>: I apologize for canceling shore
leave, but look, we have a dangerous situation out on Nimbus III.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: On “The Planet Of Galactic Peace?”</p>
<p><strong>commanders image</strong>: The same. From what we can make
out, a terrorist force has captured the only settlement. And they’ve
taken hostages.</p>
<p><strong>commanders image</strong>: The Klingon, the Romulan, the
Federation consuls. Now I know Enterprise is not exactly up to
specs…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: With all due respect, the Enterprise is a
disaster. There must be other ships in the quadrant.</p>
<p><strong>commanders image</strong>: Other ships, yes. But no
experienced commanders. Captain, I need Jim Kirk.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Oh, please.</p>
<p><strong>commanders image</strong>: Your orders are to proceed to
Nimbus III, assess the situation and avoid a confrontation if possible.
Above all, however, get those hostages back safely.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Have the Klingons responded?</p>
<p><strong>commanders image</strong>: No, but you can bet they will.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Understood. Kirk out.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I’m afraid the ship’s problems will have to be
solved en route. Since we’re undermanned, I’m counting on each one of
you to give his best. End of speech. Let’s go to work.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: The feeling’s mutual.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Engine room.</p>
<p><strong>scotty’s voice</strong>: Scotty here.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: We’ll need all the power you can muster,
Mister.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Don’t you worry, Captain. We’ll beat those
Klingon devils even if I have to get out and push.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I hope it won’t come to that, Mr. Scott.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: All possible speed, Mr. Sulu.</p>

<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Captain’s Log, Stardate 84 fif…</p>
<p><strong>computer voice</strong>: Good morning, Captain</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: That’s it. Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Captain, we’re receiving the hostage
information you requested.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Put it on the screen.</p>
<p><strong>computer voice</strong>: This is an authorized transmission
from Starfleet Galactic Memory Bank.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Not General Korrd.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: The same. He’s apparently fallen out of favor
with the Klingon High Command.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: General Korrd’s military strategies were
required learning when I was a cadet at the Academy. When they put me
out to pasture, I hope I fare better than Korrd.</p>
<p><strong>caithlin’s image</strong>: A short time ago, we willingly
surrendered ourselves to the forces of the Galactic Army of Light. At
this moment we’re in their protective custody. Their leader assures us
that we will be treated humanely so long as you cooperate with his
demands. I believe his sincerity. He requests that you send a Federation
starship to parlay for our release at once. Be assured that we are in
good health, and would appreciate your immediate response.</p>
<p><strong>sybok’s image</strong>: I deeply regret this desperate act,
but these are desperate times. I have no desire to harm these innocents
but do not put me to the test. I implore you to respond immediately.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: What is it? You look like you’ve seen a
ghost.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Perhaps I have, Captain. Perhaps I have.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Spock, what is it? Do you know this
Vulcan?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I cannot be certain.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: But he does seem familiar?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: He reminds me of someone I knew in my
youth.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I do not often think of the past.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Who is it he reminds you of?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: There was a young student, exceptionally
gifted, possessing of great intelligence. It was assumed that one day he
would take his place amongst the great scholars of Vulcan. But he was a
revolutionary.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: The knowledge and experience he sought were
forbidden by Vulcan belief.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: He rejected his logical upbringing and
embraced the animal passions of our ancestors.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: He believed the key to self-knowledge was
emotion, not logic.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: When he encouraged others to follow him, he
was banished from Vulcan, never to return.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Fascinating.</p>
<p><strong>uhura’s voice</strong>: Captain to the bridge.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: On my way.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Spock?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Coming, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Approaching Nimbus III.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Hailing frequency open.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Standard orbit, Mr. Sulu.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Captain, we’re receiving transmission from
Paradise City. They’re demanding to know our intentions.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Respond with static. Let them think we’re
having difficulty. Which wouldn’t be far from the truth.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Paradise City, can you boost your power?
We’re barely receiving transmission.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Transporter room. Status.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Scotty here, Captain. Transporter is still
inoperative. Even if we could lock onto the hostages, we couldn’t beam
them up.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Then we’ll have to get them out the old
fashioned way.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Klingon vessel now entering quadrant. Bird of
Prey. Estimating 1.9 hours until her weapons come to bear.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Damn. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Their equipment is primitive but effective. I
recommend we land at Coordinate 8563.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: That puts us pretty far away from Paradise
City.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: To land any closer would risk detection.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Mr. Sulu. Execute.</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: aye, sir.</p>
<p><strong>chekov’s voice</strong>: Paradise City.</p>
<p><strong>chekov’s image</strong>: This is the Starship Enterprise.</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: A Federation starship.</p>
<p><strong>chekov’s image</strong>: This is Captain Pavel Chekov
speaking. You are in violation of Neutral Zone Treaty. I advise you to
release your hostages at once or suffer the consequences.</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: Your threats amuse me, Captain Chekov. What
consequences did you have in mind?</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Even as we speak, a Klingon warship is on
its way. We estimate arrival within the hour.</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: I imagine the Klingons will be quite
angry.</p>
<p><strong>chekov’s image</strong>: You are a master of understatement.
They are likely to destroy the planet.</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: Then it’s fortunate that I have you and your
starship to protect me. In the meantime, Captain Chekov, I instruct you
and your First Officer to beam down to my coordinates.</p>
<p><strong>chekov’s image</strong>: We will be happy to beam down. But
first we must have certain assurances.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: At footspeed I estimate the journey to
Paradise City at 1.2 hours.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: We don’t have 1.2 hours.</p>
<p><strong>kirk’s voice</strong>: …Wait a minute… Perfect. But we will
have to get their attention.</p>
<p><strong>black soldier</strong>: What is that?</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Hello, boys… I’ve always wanted to play to a
captive audience.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Oh, damn.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Spock.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Yes, Captain?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Be one with the horse.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Yes, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>j’onn</strong>: Open the gate. It’s our lookout party.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Federation soldiers right behind us. Close the
gate!</p>
<p><strong>j’onn</strong>: Where are they going?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Spock.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Hold your horse, Captain. I’m scanning. The
hostages are in the structure just ahead.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: This is Strike Team. Start your run.</p>
<p><strong>j’onn</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Phasers on stun! Get rid of the mounts! Sulu -
take out that light!</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Yes, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>chekov’s image</strong>: I instruct you to surrender. You are
under attack by Federation forces.</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: Do you realize what you’ve done? It wasn’t
bloodshed I wanted.</p>
<p><strong>chekov’s image</strong>: Wait! Come back!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Uhura, come on down.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Roger. Coming in.</p>
<p><strong>television announcer’s voice</strong>: … recreational
opportunities are limitless.. The vicinity is famous for plentiful local
wildlife. And the fishing is terrific…</p>
<p><strong>television announcer’s voice</strong>: … easy financing
through Federation Federal can put you in your own home on the
beautiful, conveniently located…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Thank God…</p>
<p><strong>caithlin</strong>: Please cooperate.</p>
<p><strong>korrd</strong>: Ahhh…</p>
<p><strong>talbot</strong>: Would you mind handing over your
weapons?</p>
<p><strong>television announcer’s voice</strong>: Beam on down!</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: Well done, my friends.</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: Spock. It’s me. It’s Sybok. After all these
years, you’ve finally caught up with me. Don’t you have anything to say
to me?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: You are under arrest for seventeen violations
of the Neutral Zone Treaty.</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: Spock, you’ve developed a sense of humor
after all.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: It was not my intention to amuse you. These
are serious charges. However, if you surrender now-</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: I’m sorry, Spock. I can’t surrender now. I’m
not through violating Neutral Zone Treaty. In fact, I’m just getting
started. And now for my next violation I intend to steal something.
Something very big.</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: I must have your starship.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: You staged all this to get your hands on my
ship?</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: James T. Kirk, Captain of the Enterprise.</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: But I thought Captain Chekov.. I see. Very
clever, Captain. Spock, it would appear that you’ve been given a second
chance to join me. What do you say?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I am a Starfleet Officer.</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: Of course. Of course. Then I’ll take the ship
without your help.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Shuttle en route.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Position, Bird of Prey?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Closing.</p>
<p><strong>vixis</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>klaa</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>klaa</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Mr. Chekov, I’ve lost the Bird of Prey. She
must have cloaked.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Raise shields.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: But the shuttle-</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: DO it. Go to Red Alert.</p>
<p><strong>talbot</strong>: Once we’ve taken control of your vessel,
we’ll bring up the rest of our followers.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: The Klingons are out there. We’ll be lucky to
get back to the ship ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>chekov’s voice</strong>: Galileo, this is Enterprise.
Condition Red Alert. Bird of Prey approaching. She is cloaked. Raising
shields.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Recommend Galileo find safe harbor until
situation secure.</p>
<p><strong>chekov’s voice</strong>: Acknowledge.</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: No! No reply. Remain on course.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Sybok, listen to me. In order for this craft
to enter the landing bay, Enterprise must lower the shields and activate
the tractor beam. To get us inside and re-raise the shields will
take-</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Exactly 15.5 seconds.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: An eternity during which we’ll be vulnerable
to Klingon attack. Korrd-you tell him.</p>
<p><strong>korrd</strong>: He speaks the truth. If my people are
cloaked, then they intend to strike.</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: We cannot turn back.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: You must allow us to act.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Let me do something.</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: Very well. Do what you must-but no more.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Enterprise.</p>
<p><strong>kirk’s voice</strong>: This is Kirk.</p>
<p><strong>klaa</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Understand your situation. Are unable to
return to planet. Stand by to execute… Emergency Landing plan.. B</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: What’s Emergency Landing Plan B?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: I don’t have a clue.</p>
<p><strong>kirk’s voice</strong>: B as in “barricade.”</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: He can’t be serious.</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: In order to lower and raise the shields as
quickly as possible, we’re going to forego the tractor beam and fly her
in manually.</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: How often have you done this?</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Actually it’s my first attempt.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: He’s good. Really Scotty, on my mark. Open bay
doors.</p>
<p><strong>klaa</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Kirk to Scotty-lower shields!</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Lowering shields, sir.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Bird of Prey bearing one zero five mark
two.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Go, Sulu.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: They’re in!</p>
<p><strong>klaa</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>vixis</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Warp speed now!</p>
<p><strong>klaa</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>klaa</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>klaa</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: We must change our course at once.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I’ll take you to the bridge.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Spock… pick it up!</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Sybok, you must surrender.</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: No. You must kill me.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Shoot him!</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: For a moment, I thought you might actually do
it.</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: Put him in the brig with Captain Kirk. Spock,
you will accompany me to the bridge?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: No. I will not.</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: You know I’m right.</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: Then you must join them.</p>
<p><strong>korrd</strong>: These two will be useful.</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: Give us a moment alone.</p>
<p><strong>caithlin</strong>: Don’t be afraid.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Damnit, Spock. God damnit!</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Captain, what have I done -</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: What you have done is betray every man on this
ship.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Worse. I have betrayed you. I do not expect
you to forgive me.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Forgive you? I ought to knock you on your
goddamn ass!</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: If you think it would help.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: You stay out of this! Why, Spock? Why? I.. All
you had to do was pull the trigger.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: If I had pulled the trigger, Sybok would be
dead.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I ordered you to defend this ship.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: You ordered me to kill my brother.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Look, the man may be a fellow Vulcan, but that
doesn’t…</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: No, no, no, Captain. You do not understand.
Sybok also in a son of Sarek.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: You mean he’s your brother brother? You made
that up!</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I did not.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: You did too. Sybok couldn’t possibly be your
brother because I happen to know for a fact that you don’t have a
brother.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Technically, you are correct. I do not have a
brother.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: There, you see? See?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I have a half brother.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I gotta sit down.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Exactly. That is correct. Sybok’s mother was
a Vulcan princess. Upon her death, Sybok and I were raised as
brothers.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Why didn’t you tell me this before?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I was not disposed to discuss… matters of a
personal nature. For that, I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: He’s sorry, See, he’s sorry. Everything… that
makes everything all right. He’s sorry, everything’s…</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Nor I myself.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: I was beginning to worry. Where is the
Captain?</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: It’s all right Pavel. Sybok will explain
everything.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Sulu, what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Plotting our new course.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: New course? You have no authority. What’s
going on here?</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Pavel.</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: I won’t force you.</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: You’ve got to listen to this man.</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: The decision must be yours.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: Each of us hides a secret pain. Share yours
with me and gain strength from the sharing.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Useless.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Unwise.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: You could’ve warned me.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: There’s got to be a way out of this place.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: This is a new brig, Captain. It is
escape-proof.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: The designers tested it using the most
intelligent and resourceful person they could find. He failed to
escape.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: This, er, person… didn’t by any chance have
pointed ears and an unerring capacity for getting his shipmates into
trouble, did he?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: He did have pointed ears.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Following new course. Warp seven.</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Estimating destination in 6.7 hours, present
speed.</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: Now that we’re underway, it’s time I
announced my intentions to the rest of the ship. Brave crew of the
Starship Enterprise… Consider the questions of existence. These are the
questions which man has asked ever since he first gazed at the stars and
dreamed.</p>
<p><strong>sybok’s image</strong>: My Vulcan ancestors were ruled by
their emotions. They felt with their hearts. They believed with their
hearts. But above all else, they believed in a place in which these
questions of existence would be answered. Modern dogma tells us this
place is a myth, a fantasy concocted by pagans.</p>
<p><strong>sybok’s voice</strong>: It is no fantasy! I tell you it
exists!</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: My brothers, we have been chosen to undertake
the greatest adventure of all time - the discovery of Sha Ka Ree.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Is it possible?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Is what possible?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: That he’s found it. Sha Ka Ree. The reason
Sybok left Vulcan.</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: Our destination is the planet Sha Ka Ree,
which lies beyond the Great Barrier…</p>
<p><strong>sybok’s image</strong>: … at the center of the galaxy.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: The center of the galaxy?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: There Sha Ka Ree is fabled to exist.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: But the center of the galaxy can’t be reached.
No ship has ever gone into the Great Barrier. No probe has ever
returned.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Sybok possessed the keenest intellect I have
ever known.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Spock! My only concern is getting the ship
back. When that’s done and Sybok is in here then you can debate Sha Ka
Ree until you’re green in the face. Until then, you’re either with me or
you’re not.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I am here, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: That’s a little vague, Spock -</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: What’s that noise?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I believe it is a primitive form of
communication known as Morse Code.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: You’re right. I’m a little out of practice.
Uh….that’s an “s.”</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: A “t.”</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: “a”… “n”…uh, “d”… end of word.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: New word. “b”.. “a”… um…</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: “c.”… “k.”</p>
<p><strong>together</strong>: Stand back!!</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: The bond between these three is strong…
difficult to penetrate. This will be quite a challenge.</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: We’ve got to find them!</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Captain, we can’t trust anyone now.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: If we could send a distress signal…</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: There is an emergency sending apparatus in
the forward observation room.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: The only problem is, it’s up there. We’re down
here.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: You might be able to reach it by means of
turbo shaft number three which is closed for repairs. It’s a long and
dangerous climb.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Mr. Scott, get the transporter working. If we
contact a rescue ship we’ll need it. Which way to the turbo shaft?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Head down that tunnel to the hydro vent and
turn right. Then left at the blowscreen. You can’t miss it.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Mr. Scott, you’re amazing.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Oh, there’s nothing amazing about it. I know
this ship like the back of my hand.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: All right, look at it this way. We’ll get a
good workout.</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Get Mr. Scott to sick bay.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Where’s Spock?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I believe I have found a faster way.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Hmmm?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Uh-uh.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Bones…?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: We’re not splitting up.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: It would appear we are too heavy.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: It must be all those marsh melons.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Spock… the booster rockets.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: If I activate them now, Captain, we will be
propelled upward at an unbelievable rate.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Fire the rockets!</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Captain, please come back down here.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Hit the brakes!</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I’m afraid I overshot the mark by one
level.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Spock.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: The emergency channel, open.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: To anyone within the sound of my voice: This
is Captain James T. Kirk of the Federation Starship Enterprise. If you
read me, acknowledge. Acknowledge.</p>
<p><strong>female voice</strong>: Enterprise, this is Starfleet Command.
We read you. Over.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: A hostile force has seized control of our
vessel and put us on a direct course with the Great Barrier. Our
coordinates are zero-zero-zero…</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: …mark two.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Mark two. Request emergency assistance.
Acknowledge.</p>
<p><strong>vixis</strong>: Understood, Enterprise. We are dispatching a
rescue ship immediately.</p>
<p><strong>kirk’s voice</strong>: Roger, Starfleet.</p>
<p><strong>klaa</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>vixis</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>klaa</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: I trust your message was received?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: You can’t expect us to stand by while you take
the ship into the Great Barrier.</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: What you fear is the unknown. The people of
your planet once believed their world was flat. Columbus proved it was
round. They said the sound barrier could never be broken. It was broken.
They said warp speed could not be achieved. The Great Barrier is the
ultimate expression of this universal fear. It’s an extension of
personal fear. Captain Kirk, I so much want your understanding. I want
your respect. Are you afraid to hear me out?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I’m afraid of nothing.</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: Wait outside.</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: I’m sure you have many questions Here, amidst
the stars of our own galaxy, we shall seek the answers together.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Easy, easy, easy, Scotty. Easy. You’re back
with us.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Uhura, I had the strangest dream. I dreamt
that a madman had taken over the Enterprise.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Scotty, dear, he’ not a madman.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: He’s not?</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: No. Sybok has simply put us in touch with
feelings we’ve always been afraid to express.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: I.. er… have to get back the
transporter.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: No, no, no. Scotty - Scotty… There’s so much
I want to tell you.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Maybe you could wait until I’m a wee bit
stronger I don’t think I could take it in my present condition. Or
yours.</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: Sha Ka Ree. “The Scource.” “Heaven.” “Eden.”
call it “Qui’Tu.” To the Romulans, it’s “Vorta Vor.” The Andorian word
is.. unpronounceable. Still, every culture shares he common dream of a
place from which creation sprang. For us, that place will soon be a
reality.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: The only realty I see is that I’m a prisoner
on my own ship. What is this power you have to control the minds of my
crew?</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: I don’t control minds. I free them.</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: By making you face your pain and draw
strength from it. Once that’s done, fear cannot stop you.</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: Your pain is the deepest of all.</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: I can feel it. Can’t you?</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Leonard…</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Leonard…</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Leonard…</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: The pain… stop the pain.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: I can’t stand the pain. Help me.</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: You’ve done all you can. The support system
will keep him alive.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Son, release me…</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: You’re a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: Why did you do it?</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: That wasn’t the worst of it.</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: Was it?</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: Share it.</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: So if you hadn’t killed him he might have
lived.</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: Then you did what you thought was right.</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: Release this pain.. Release it. This pain has
poisoned your soul for a long time.</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: Now you’ve taken the first step. The other
steps we’ll take together.</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: Each man’s pain is unique.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I hide no pain.</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: I know you better than that.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Do you?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Spock… don’t.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: It’s all right, Captain. Proceed.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I believe we are witnessing my birth.</p>
<p><strong>sarek</strong>: So human.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Spock… What have you done to my friends?</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: I’ve done nothing. This is who they are.
Didn’t you know that?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: No… I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: Now learn something about yourself.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: No. I refuse.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: About what? That I’ve made the wrong choices
in my life? That I turned left when I should’ve turned right? I know
what my weaknesses are. I don’t need Sybok to take me on a tour of
them.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: And be brainwashed by this con man?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Damnit, Bones, you’re a doctor. You know that
pain and guilt can’t be taken away with a wave of a magic wand. They’re
things we carry with us - the things that make us who we are. If we lost
them, we lose ourselves. I don’t want my pain taken away. I need my
pain.</p>
<p><strong>uhura’s voice</strong>: Sybok, this is the bridge. We’re in
approach of the Great Barrier.</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: Captain, I’m afraid you’ll have to remain
here. Spock. Dr. McCoy… Come with me.</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: Spock?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I cannot go with you.</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I belong here.</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: I don’t understand…</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Sybok, you are my brother, but you do not
know me. I am not the outcast boy you left behind those many years ago.
Since that time I have found myself and my place. I know who I am. And I
cannot go with you.</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: Then I’ll see you on the other side.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Wait! You know we’ll never make it through the
Great Barrier.</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: But if we do, will that convince you that my
vision was true?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Your vision?</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: Given to me by God. He waits for us on the
other side.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: You are mad!</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: Am I? We’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: They say no ship can survive this.</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: I say they’re wrong. I say the danger is an
illusion.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: We have no instrument readings. Is it there
or isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: Mr. Sulu… full ahead.</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Full ahead, aye.</p>
<p><strong>kirk’s voice</strong>: Is it possible?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Fascinating.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: If we are, then life is a dream.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Instruments are back on line. Incredible.
There’s a power scource emanating form the planet like nothing I’ve ever

<p><strong>caithlin</strong>: Vorta Vor.</p>
<p><strong>talbot</strong>: Eden.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: About the ship…</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: The ship needs its Captain.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: No special conditions?</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: No conditions.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: What makes you think I won’t turn us
around?</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: Because you, too, must know.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Well, if we’re going to do it… … we’re going
to do by the book. Mr. Chekov, you take the con. Mr. Sulu, standard
orbital approach. Uhura, alert the shuttlecraft to stand by. Sybok,
Spock, Dr. McCoy - come with me. The rest of you remain on board until I
determine what we’re dealing with.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Well, don’t just stand there. God’s a busy
man.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I am no longer in control of the craft.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: All right. We’ll play it your way.</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: It’s amazing. The land… the sky… just as I
knew it would be.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Scotty, you’ve got to see this.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: I don’t have the time. The Captain told me
to get this transporter working and I’m not about to let him down.</p>
<p><strong>quadrant. recommend</strong>: ACTIVATION OF DEFENSE
SYSTEMS.:AWAITING COMMAND.” A low warning BEEP. But no one’s there to
respond.</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: We have traveled far by starship…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Enterprise, this is Kirk. We have, er…</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Sybok, perhaps, er…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Brave souls. Welcome.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: One voice. Many faces.</p>
<p><strong>being</strong>: Does this better suit your expectations?</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: Qual se tu?</p>
<p><strong>being</strong>: It is I. The journey you undertook to reach
me could not have been an easy one.</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: It was not. The Barrier stood between us -
but we breached it.</p>
<p><strong>being</strong>: Magnificent. You are the first to find
me.</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: We sought only your infinite wisdom.</p>
<p><strong>being</strong>: And how did you breach the Barrier?</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: With a starship!</p>
<p><strong>being</strong>: This starship, could it carry my wisdom
beyond the Barrier?</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: It could. Yes.</p>
<p><strong>being</strong>: Then I shall make use of this starship.</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: It will be your chariot!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>being</strong>: It will carry my power to every corner of
creation…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I’d just like to ask a question.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: What does God need with a starship?</p>
<p><strong>being</strong>: Bring the ship closer.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I said… what does God need with a
starship?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I’m asking a question.</p>
<p><strong>being</strong>: Who is this creature?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Who am I? Don’t you know? Aren’t you God?</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: He has his doubts…</p>
<p><strong>being</strong>: You doubt me?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I seek proof.</p>
<p><strong>being</strong>: Then here is the proof that you seek.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Why.. is God… angry?</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: Why? Why have you done this to my friend?</p>
<p><strong>being</strong>: He doubts me.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: You have not answered his question. What does
God need with a starship?</p>
<p><strong>being</strong>: Do you doubt me?</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: Stop! The God of Sha Ka Ree would not do
this!</p>
<p><strong>being</strong>: Sha Ka Ree? A vision you created. An eternity
I’ve been imprisoned in this place! The ship! I must have the ship! Now
give me what I want!</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Sybok - this is not the God of Sha Ka Ree -
or any other God!</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: I don’t understand.. Reveal yourself to
me!</p>
<p><strong>being</strong>: What’s wrong? Don’t you like this face? I
have so many. But this one suits you best.</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: No, no, it’s not possible.</p>
<p><strong>being</strong>: Bring me the ship or I will destroy you!</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: The ship….</p>
<p><strong>being</strong>: Bring it closer so that I might join with it.
Do it, or watch these puny things die horribly.</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: What have I done?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Kirk to Enterprise. Listen carefully…</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: Spock…</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Sybok.</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: This is my doing. This is my arrogance… my
vanity…</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Sybok, we must find a way…</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: No. You must save yourselves. Forgive me,
brother. Forgive me.</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: I couldn’t help but notice you pain.</p>
<p><strong>being</strong>: My pain?</p>
<p><strong>sybok</strong>: It runs deep. Share it with me.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Enterprise… are you ready?</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: In firing position. Torpedo armed.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: But, Captain, we’re firing directly on your
position.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Send it down, Mr. Chekov. Now!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Run! Go!</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Sybok…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: We’ve got to get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Sulu, I’ve lost them.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Spock, get us out of here!</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Thrusters are inoperative.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Mr. Scott!</p>
<p><strong>scotty’s voice</strong>: Scotty here, sir.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Please tell me the transporter is working.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: She’s got partial power, sir. I might be
able to take two of you.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Beam up Spock and Dr. McCoy. Now!</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Thank you, Mr. Scott. Beam up the
Captain.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Aye-aye.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Please get a grip on yourself, Doctor. Status
report.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Klingon Captain wishes to name his terms,
Mr. Spock.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: On screen.</p>
<p><strong>klaa’s image</strong>: This is Captain Klaa of the Klingon
Empire. Attempt to raise shields or arm weapons and I will destroy you.
You are alive for a single reason. The renegade James T. Kirk. Hand him
over and I will spare your lives. My transporter stands ready to beam
him aboard.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Captain Kirk is not among us.</p>
<p><strong>klaa’s image</strong>: You lie!</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I’m a Vulcan. I’m incapable of lying. Captain
Kirk is on the planet below.</p>
<p><strong>klaa’s image</strong>: Then give me his coordinates!</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: General, I am in need of your assistance.</p>
<p><strong>korrd</strong>: My assistance?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: You are his superior officer.</p>
<p><strong>korrd</strong>: I am a foolish old man.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Damn you, sir, you will try!</p>
<p><strong>spock’s voice</strong>: Klingon Commander, someone wishes to
speak with you.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: So it’s me you want, you Klingon bastards!
What are you waiting for?!</p>
<p><strong>korrd</strong>: Release him.</p>
<p><strong>korrd</strong>: Kirk, my junior officer has something he
wants to say to you.</p>
<p><strong>klaa</strong>: I apologize.</p>
<p><strong>klaa</strong>: The attack upon your vessel was not authorized
by my government.</p>
<p><strong>korrd</strong>: Kirk, and now, may I present our new
gunner.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Spock?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Welcome aboard, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Spock, I thought I was going to die.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Not possible. You were never alone.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Please, Captain, not in front of the
Klingons.</p>
<p><strong>265 int. enterprise - forward observation room - angle
on</strong>: KORRD</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Would you care for a wee nip of Scotch
whiskey?</p>
<p><strong>korrd</strong>: Ummmm…</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: I never thought I’d ever be drinking with a
Klingon, heh?</p>
<p><strong>korrd</strong>: What are you two conspiring about?</p>
<p><strong>talbot</strong>: We were just saying how far we’ve come in
such a short space of time.</p>
<p><strong>korrd</strong>: We certainly have.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: She has wonderful muscles.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Cosmic thoughts, gentlemen?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Maybe he’s not out there, Bones. Maybe he’s
right here… in the human heart Spock?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I was thinking of Sybok. I’ve lost a
brother.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Yes. I lost a brother once. I was lucky. I got
him back.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I was wrong.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Are you just going to sit there and pluck that
thing? Or are you going to play something?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: “Row, row, row your boat, gently down the
stream, merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream.”</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: “Row, row, row your boat, gently down the
