<p><strong>final shooting script</strong>: July 27, 2006</p>
<p><strong>bumpy o/s</strong>: This is the problem. This is what’s wrong
with America.</p>
<p><strong>bumpy o/s</strong>: It’s gotten so big you can’t find your
way.</p>
<p><strong>bumpy</strong>: The corner grocery’s a supermarket. Candy
store’s a MacDonald’s. And this place.</p>
<p><strong>bumpy</strong>: Where’s the pride of ownership here? Where’s
the personal service? Does anybody work here?</p>
<p><strong>bumpy</strong>: What right do they have cutting out the
suppliers, pushing all the middlemen out, buying direct from the
manufacturer - Sony this, Toshiba that, all them Chinks - putting
Americans out of work?</p>
<p><strong>bumpy</strong>: What am I supposed to do with a place like
this, Frank? Who am I supposed to ask for, the assistant manager? This
is the problem. This is the way it is now: You can’t find the heart of
anything to stick the knife.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Somebody call an ambulance!</p>
<p><strong>bumpy</strong>: Forget it, Frank. No one’s in charge.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: - whose passing has brought together a
who’s who of mourners on this chilly afternoon. The Governor has come
down. The mayor of New York - its Chief of Police and Commissioner -
sports and entertainment luminaries -</p>
<p><strong>reporter on tv</strong>: He was a Great Man, according to the
eulogies. A giving man. A man of the people. No one chose to include in
their remembrances the word most often associated with Ellsworth Bumpy
Johnson: Gangster.</p>
<p><strong>tosca</strong>: White wine, please.</p>
<p><strong>banker</strong>: How you doing, Frank?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>banker</strong>: What a loss. How are you otherwise? Things
okay financially?</p>
<p><strong>banker</strong>: Bumpy set something up for you?</p>
<p><strong>tango</strong>: Hey, Frank, get me an ashtray while you’re at
it.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I know you’re hurting, Frank. So am I.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You going to be all right?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’m sure Bumpy never told you, but he made
me promise, anything ever happened to him, I’d make sure you didn’t go
without.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’ll be fine, Charlie. Half the people here
owed Bumpy money when he died. A lot of money. If they think I’m going
to forget to collect, they’re wrong.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: That’s the spirit. Go get them.</p>
<p><strong>richie v.o.</strong>: I live in fear of hearing my name
called.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Mr. Roberts, Give us U.S. vs. Meade -</p>
<p><strong>richie v.o.</strong>: Of walking up there, turning around,
knowing every one of them knows more than I do -</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Subject, issues, what the determination
was and what it means to us today.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: You know the Number 1 fear of most people
isn’t dying; it’s public speaking. They get physically ill. They throw
up.</p>
<p><strong>rivera</strong>: And that’s what you want to do for a
living.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: I don’t like being like that. I want to beat
it.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Hey -</p>
<p><strong>rivera</strong>: Who’s going to do this?</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: He knows me, he’ll take it from me. I’ve
known him since high school.</p>
<p><strong>rivera</strong>: Just throw it in, he doesn’t take it. That’s
good service.</p>
<p><strong>rivera</strong>: Throw it -</p>
<p><strong>rivera</strong>: Down -</p>
<p><strong>campizi</strong>: I swear to God, Richie, I didn’t know it
was you. I would never slam a door on your hand. Knowingly.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: You bit my fuckin hand -</p>
<p><strong>campizi</strong>: What can we do, Richie? You don’t want to
do this. For old times sake, what can we do? Who do you want? Who can I
give you? You want Big Sal’s bookie? You want his accountant? I’ll give
him to you.</p>
<p><strong>11 int. new york police annex - property room - day
11</strong>: One of the same undercover cops - Detective Trupo -
scribbles a signature and badge number different from the one on his
gold shield lying next to the voucher requesting evidence needed in
court.</p>
<p><strong>trupo</strong>: Now just enough for the reagent test.</p>
<p><strong>rossi v/o</strong>: This is the French Connection dope. The
same dope Popeye Doyle and Sonny Grasso took from us.</p>
<p><strong>rossi v/o</strong>: They seize it, arrest everybody, whack it
up and sell it back to us. Our dope. They been living off it for years,
these New York cops.</p>
<p><strong>rossi</strong>: They basically control the market with it.
What the fuck has happened to the world, Frank?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Fuckin crooks.</p>
<p><strong>rossi</strong>: Sad about Bumpy.</p>
<p><strong>rossi</strong>: Things are never going to be the same in
Harlem. The girls, the clubs, the music - walk down the street, nobody
bothers you because Bumpy’s making sure of it. How bad is it there
now?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It’s chaos. Every gorilla for himself.</p>
<p><strong>rossi</strong>: Who can live like that? There has to be
order. That would never happen with Italians. More important than any
one man’s life - is order.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Thank you, Charlene. Last one.</p>
<p><strong>charlene</strong>: It’s all right with me, Frank, you can
stay all day if you want, but I wouldn’t. It’s nice outside.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Then maybe I’ll have to go for a walk. Just
cause you said so.</p>
<p><strong>21 int. redtop’s apartment building - day 21</strong>: Frank
leads the servicemen up the stairs of a building.</p>
<p><strong>red top</strong>: On the house for our men in uniform.</p>
<p><strong>serviceman 1</strong>: Why, thank you, sugar, that’s very
kind.</p>
<p><strong>red top</strong>: Thank Frank.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: How’s Nate? You seen him?</p>
<p><strong>serviceman 1</strong>: All the time. Nate is everywhere. He’s
good. Got himself a club now.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Where, Saigon?</p>
<p><strong>serviceman 1</strong>: Bangkok.</p>
<p><strong>serviceman 2</strong>: I don’t think he’s ever coming
home.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You’re gonna have to boot it a couple times.
Cops keep cutting it, selling it, cutting it -</p>
<p><strong>serviceman 1</strong>: I don’t want to say anything cause the
price is right - but the shit in Nam is way, way, way, way, way -</p>
<p><strong>campizi</strong>: That’s him.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: All right. Get lost. Get out.</p>
<p><strong>rivera</strong>: We gonna stay with him or the car?</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Let’s see who comes for the car.</p>
<p><strong>rivera</strong>: Think he made us?</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: You called for the warrant? Where are
they?</p>
<p><strong>rivera</strong>: I just called. I called and walked back here
and ten seconds has gone by.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: We saw him with the slips, Javy.</p>
<p><strong>rivera</strong>: You saw policy slips? You saw grocery bags.
You don’t know what’s in them.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Yes, I do, and so do you, don’t give me that
bullshit -</p>
<p><strong>rivera</strong>: What’s the rush? Half an hour the warrant’ll
be here -</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: I got night school.</p>
<p><strong>rivera</strong>: Guess you’re going to miss it. You know,
what you were saying before - about throwing up in front of people -
money will take that feeling away.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Not when it’s less.</p>
<p><strong>rivera</strong>: Less than what.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Than what I make now.</p>
<p><strong>rivera</strong>: No lawyer on earth makes less than a
cop.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: They do in the Prosecutor’s Office. Three
thousand less.</p>
<p><strong>rivera</strong>: You’re fuckin kidding me.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Fuck this -</p>
<p><strong>rivera</strong>: Richie -</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Check inside.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Javy …</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: This isn’t a couple of bucks.</p>
<p><strong>rivera</strong>: It’s the same thing. In principle.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: We’re talking about principle?</p>
<p><strong>rivera</strong>: Richie, a cop who turns in this kind of
money says one thing: He’ll turn in cops who take money. We’ll be
pariahs.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: We’re fucked either way.</p>
<p><strong>rivera</strong>: Not if we keep it. Only if we don’t. Then
we’re fucked, you’re right. But not if we keep it.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Yes, we are.</p>
<p><strong>rivera</strong>: Goddamn it, did we ask for this? Did we put
a gun to someone’s head and say, Give us your money? Cops kill cops they
can’t trust. We can’t turn it in.</p>
<p><strong>toback</strong>: How much.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Nine hundred and eighty thousand.</p>
<p><strong>toback</strong>: What happened to the rest?</p>
<p><strong>toback</strong>: What’re you doing counting this in front of
everybody? Are you out of your fuckin mind? Take it into a room.
Now.</p>
<p><strong>tango</strong>: Didn’t you see the jar, Frank? I think you
walked right past it.</p>
<p><strong>tango</strong>: The money jar. On the corner. What I got to
do, put a sign on it?</p>
<p><strong>tango</strong>: Bumpy don’t own 116th Street no more, Frank.
Bumpy don’t own no real estate in Harlem no more. I’m the landlord now
and the lease is twenty-percent.</p>
<p><strong>tango</strong>: Then don’t sell dope, Frank. Get a fuckin
job. You need a job? You can be my driver, drive me around, open my
door, yes, sir, no sir, where to, sir, right away, Massa Johnson,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Twenty percent?</p>
<p><strong>tango</strong>: Of every dollar. Every VIG, every truckload,
every girl, every ounce. In the jar.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Twenty percent’s my profit. If I’m giving it
to you then what am I doing? Twenty percent puts me, and everyone you
know, out of business, which puts you out of business. There are ways to
make money legitimately, and then there’s this way. Not even Bumpy took
twenty percent.</p>
<p><strong>tango</strong>: Bumpy’s fuckin dead.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: There. That’s twenty-percent.</p>
<p><strong>bumpy v/o</strong>: A leader is like a shepherd -</p>
<p><strong>bumpy v/o</strong>: Sends the fast nimble sheep out front,
and the others follow as the shepherd walks quietly behind -</p>
<p><strong>bumpy</strong>: He’s got the stick - the cane - and he’ll use
if he has to.</p>
<p><strong>bumpy</strong>: But most of the time he doesn’t have to. He
moves the whole herd - quietly.</p>
<p><strong>bumpy</strong>: What right do they have cutting out the
suppliers, the middlemen, buying direct, putting Americans out of work …
This is the way it is now, Frank.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Get yourself a new suit.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: I don’t know, Richie.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: It couldn’t be avoided. Next weekend I’ll be
able to take him.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: I’m moving.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: What? Where?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: To the St. Regis, what do you care. My
sister’s.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Your sister’s. In Vegas?</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: You can’t move to Vegas. Not with Michael
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: What am I supposed to do with him? Leave him
with you? There’s a picture.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Hey, you want to shut up over there?</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: No court will allow it for one thing. I
won’t allow it.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: You?</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: When am I supposed to see my son?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Last weekend!</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Laurie, you can’t raise a kid in Las
Vegas.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Oh, like this is a good environment. Around
your friends. There are less creeps in Vegas.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: What’s he going to grow up to be in a mobbed
up place like that? What are you thinking?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: I’m thinking - Richie - of him!</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Goddamn it -</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: I told you nice to shut the fuck up. Now I’m
gonna kill you.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Pick up the fuckin glass!</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: Frank - ?</p>
<p><strong>thai</strong>: He say how much he wants?</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: He said “a lot.” What that means, I don’t
know. Four or five keys?</p>
<p><strong>thai</strong>: He’s your cousin.</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: My cousin-in-law. My ex-wife’s cousin.</p>
<p><strong>thai</strong>: Ask him how much he wants.</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: How much you gonna want, Frank?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: A hundred kilos.</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: No one I know can get that much. It’d have to
be pieced together from several suppliers and none of it’s gonna be 100-
percent pure.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: That’s not what I want.</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: I know that. But that means dealing with the
Chiu-Chou syndicates in Cholon or Saigon - if they’ll deal with you
-</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: No, even then it’s too late. It’s been
chopped. I want to get it where they get it. From the source.</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: You’re gonna go get it.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Why not.</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: You’re gonna go into the fuckin jungle -</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’ve lived in jungles all my -</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: No. This is the jungle. Tigers. Vietcong. The
fuckin snakes alone will kill you.</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: He says this whole area’s controlled by the
Kuomintang - Chiang Kai-Shek’s defeated army.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: They ain’t Chinese.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: How would you get it into the States?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What do you care?</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Who do you work for in there?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What do you care?</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Who are you really?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It says right there. Frank Lucas.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: I mean, who you represent?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Me.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: You think you’re going to take a hundred
kilos of heroin into the US and you don’t work for anyone? Someone is
going to allow that?</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: I don’t believe a word of this.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: After this first purchase, if you’re not
killed by Marseilles importers - or their people in the States - then
what?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Then there’d be more. On a regular basis.
Though I’d rather not have to drag my ass all the way up here every
time.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Of course not.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Where’s it now?</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: Bangkok. I can bring it here or anywhere in
between.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: A hundred kilos. I never seen that much
dope in one place.</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: It’s bigger than an Amana refrigerator-
freezer.</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: Fifty grand. In advance. That’ll cover them,
the pilots and the guys on the other end.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Give them a hundred.</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: Fifty, to cover them all.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: A hundred. And it’s all I got left. So if
that dope doesn’t arrive, for whatever reason - Cousin or no cousin -
don’t let me down.</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: I’ll let you know when it’s in the air.</p>
<p><strong>rivera v/o</strong>: Richie? Richie, I’m in trouble. This
fuckin guy “made” me - I don’t know how but he did. He went for his gun.
I had to do it, I swear to God. Now they’re going to kill me.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Who.</p>
<p><strong>rivera v/o</strong>: There’s a hundred people out there heard
the shots. You gotta help me. You gotta do something.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Is he dead?</p>
<p><strong>rivera v/o</strong>: He’s dead. I’m dead. They’re gonna kill
me.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Where are you? Javy, where are you?</p>
<p><strong>rivera v/o</strong>: That’s the problem.</p>
<p><strong>dispatcher</strong>: There are no cars in that area,
Detective Roberts.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Bullshit. I got a man in trouble and I need
back-up.</p>
<p><strong>dispatcher</strong>: I missed that - you’re breaking up -</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: I said, put the fucking call out again -</p>
<p><strong>dispatcher</strong>: I just did. No one responded. I’ll try
again, but -</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Fuck you, too.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Sergeant, I’m not asking, I’m fuckin telling
you: Get some patrolmen over here now.</p>
<p><strong>paramedic</strong>: You got no back-up? Why is that?</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Bandage his head.</p>
<p><strong>paramedic</strong>: Detective … he’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: I know he’s fucking dead. Bandage his head,
clean him up, put him on a gurney and prop it up so he’s sitting. And
open his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Step back, injured man coming out. Let them
do their job and he’ll be all right. Ma’am. Excuse me. Step back. Sir.
Please.</p>
<p><strong>rivera</strong>: Thank you -</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: You robbed him, didn’t you.</p>
<p><strong>rivera</strong>: What? What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: This. Where’d this come from?</p>
<p><strong>rivera</strong>: What. That’s my money. I’ve never taken
dirty money in my life.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: You lying piece of shit -</p>
<p><strong>rivera</strong>: Maybe the occasional gratuity. Like anybody
else. You’re going to tell me that’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>rivera</strong>: No, it isn’t. It’s part of the salary for
getting shot at. For that, certain courtesies are shown. In gratitude
-</p>
<p><strong>rivera</strong>: A discount on a TV, a Doughboy in the
backyard, a new dress for your girlfriend maybe once a year. I’m talking
about not living in fucking poverty. You want to call that wrong, call
it wrong.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: It’s wrong.</p>
<p><strong>rivera</strong>: Then goddamn it, pay me fifty grand a year,
you son of a bitch. Pay me what I deserve for getting shot at. No? Fine.
Next time four guys come into your place with sawed-off shotguns, you
take care of it.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: You robbed him, and then you shot him, and I
helped you get out of there. How many more you shot?</p>
<p><strong>rivera</strong>: You know what, Richie? Fuck you, you make
that kind of accusation against your own kind. And you know why.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: You’re a disgrace.</p>
<p><strong>rivera</strong>: I’m a leper. Because I listened to you and
turned in a million fucking dollars. You know who’ll work with me after
that? Same as you. No one.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Don’t look down there. Look here. You ever
fuckin threaten me again, I’ll kill you.</p>
<p><strong>70 ext. army base, new jersey - dusk 70</strong>: Silence.
Marshland. A beat-up Chevy parked alongside a perimeter fence. Frank
waits by the car as a military Jeep with its lights out comes across a
firing range. It slows, stops. In it, the silhouettes of three
servicemen, black, armed with M-16’s. Silence again, before:</p>
<p><strong>army captain</strong>: Open the trunk.</p>
<p><strong>chemist</strong>: Typically what I see is 25 to 45 percent
pure. I’ve never seen anything like this. No alkaloids, no adulterants,
no dilutents. It’s a hundred percent. May I?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Take it with you. I don’t want to have to
call the coroner.</p>
<p><strong>chemist</strong>: Store it in a cool, dark place.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Yeah … for you.</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>frank v/o</strong>: Teddy.</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: Who’s this?</p>
<p><strong>frank v/o</strong>: Frank.</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: Frank who?</p>
<p><strong>frank v/0</strong>: Frank your brother.</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: I’m not talking about your proclivities,
Richie. Those I only know too well. I’m talking about being a cop.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: About taking money? I don’t care about
money. I don’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: Because it’ll come out. You’re going to have
to sit down with shrinks and social workers, her lawyers, the judge,
lots of questions.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: What’s going on there?</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: Scheduling.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: No, the money.</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: Scheduling. What about your friends from the
neighborhood? You still hang out with them?</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: I play softball on Sundays with some
guys.</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: Wise guys. That’s going to look good.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: I grew up with them, big deal.</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: What about Anthony Zaca?</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: What about him?</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: Richie, I’m just trying to understand things
your wife has said. If they’re not true, tell me.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Yeah, Tony’s one of them.</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: Is he also your son’s godfather?</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: Do you really care about this? Or do you
just not want her to win - ever. How often do you see your son as it
is?</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Not enough. But she wants to make it
never.</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: Yeah, all right. Give me a twenty. Well, I’m
not going to sit here all day.</p>
<p><strong>bailiff</strong>: All rise -</p>
<p><strong>turner</strong>: He got an arm on him. Major League arm,
ain’t that right.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You show me after supper.</p>
<p><strong>turner</strong>: You can’t catch him. He’ll take your head
off. We’re talking 95-mile-an-hour. You know how fast that is? You see
the ball leave his hand, and that’s the last you see it before it knocks
you down.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Is that right.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: This is your room.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lucas</strong>: How did you …</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I had it made. From memory.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lucas</strong>: You were five when they took it away.
How could you remember it?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I remember.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lucas</strong>: It’s perfect. It’s all perfect. I’m so
proud of you.</p>
<p><strong>frank v/o</strong>: The man I worked for ran one of the
biggest companies in New York City for almost fifty years.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I was with him every day for fifteen of them,
looking after him, taking care of things, protecting him, learning from
him.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Bumpy was rich, but never white man rich.
Why? Because he didn’t own the company. He thought he did. He didn’t. He
only managed it. Someone else owned it. So they owned him.</p>
<p><strong>79 int/ext. redtop’s apartment building - harlem - day
79</strong>: Frank leads his brothers up the stairs and down the
hall.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Nobody owns me. Because I own my company.</p>
<p><strong>intercut</strong>: Feminine hands stamp small packets of blue
cellophane with the words `Blue Magic’ -</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: And my company sells a product that’s better
than the competition’s at a price that’s lower.</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: What are we selling, Frank?</p>
<p><strong>redtop</strong>: Hi, Frank.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Honey, these are my brothers.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What matters in business is honesty,
integrity, hard work, loyalty, and never forgetting where you came
from.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You are what you are and that’s one of two
things. You’re nothing … or you’re something. Understand what I’m
saying?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Hey, Tango, what’s up. I was just thinking
about you.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I was looking at the jar and you know what? I
didn’t see nothing in it.</p>
<p><strong>tango</strong>: The fuck you want, Frank -</p>
<p><strong>tango</strong>: What’re you going to do, boy? Shoot me in
broad daylight? In front of everyone?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Yeah, that’s right.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: For the cops. Should be enough.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: That basically’s the whole picture right
there.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Did you know his girlfriend? Good-
looking girl. One of his informants.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Beth.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Should’ve seen their place. Like animals
lived there.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: I have seen it.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Chose a good night, huh? Grand Central
Station in here.</p>
<p><strong>medical examiner</strong>: It’s been like this. I’m lucky I
get home before midnight; lots of careless- ness.</p>
<p><strong>reporter v/o</strong>: Heroin addiction is no longer
exclusive to big city neighborhoods; it’s epidemic -</p>
<p><strong>85 time cut. a television: 85</strong>: The reports shows
lawmakers on Capitol Hill juxtaposed against images of inner-cities,
junkies, homicide victims and, perhaps most telling, white suburbia.</p>
<p><strong>reporter on tv</strong>: Since 1965, law enforcement has
watched its steady increase and with it a rise in violent crime. Now
unaccountably, it has exploded, reaching into cities as a whole - our
suburbs and towns - our schools.</p>
<p><strong>reporter on tv</strong>: Someone is finally saying: enough.
Federal authorities have announced their intention to establish special
narcotics bureaus in Washington, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston,
Newark and other major cities -</p>
<p><strong>richie v/o</strong>: It’s a dog and pony show.</p>
<p><strong>toback v/o</strong>: It’s not being advertised as one.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: But it’s federal. I’d have to answer to who?
FBI?</p>
<p><strong>toback</strong>: Me and the U.S. Attorney. No one else. No
FBI. Hoover knows better than to mix his men with dope. Too much
temptation for the feeble-minded.</p>
<p><strong>toback</strong>: Richie, a detective who doesn’t have the
cooperation of his fellow detectives can’t be effective.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: You know why I don’t have it.</p>
<p><strong>toback</strong>: Doesn’t matter.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: No, they’re all on the take and I’m not and
it doesn’t matter to anyone. Instead of giving you a medal for turning
in money, they bury you.</p>
<p><strong>toback</strong>: It’s fucked up. You’re right. Maybe this’s
an opportunity away from all that.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: I’ll do it, but only like this: I don’t set
foot in a police station again. I work out of a place of my own. And I
pick my own guys. Guys I know wouldn’t take a nickel off the
sidewalk.</p>
<p><strong>toback</strong>: Done.</p>
<p><strong>90 int. basement - narcotics squad hq - day 90</strong>:
Richie regards the colored light thrown down by the stained glass
windows -</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: This is the only floor we’ll be using.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: No loan, no contingencies. Cash sale.</p>
<p><strong>singer</strong>: Mr. Joe Louis, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Who’s the beauty queen?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: She is a beauty queen. No kidding. Miss
Puerto Rico.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: What. These are clothes. This is a very nice
-</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’m wearing clothes. These are clothes. Those
- - are a costume. With a sign on it that says Arrest me. You look like
fuckin Jackie Fox.</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: What’s wrong with Jackie. I like Jackie.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You like Jackie? You want to be Superfly? Go
work for him, end up in a cell with him.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: The guy making all the noise in the room is
the weak one. That’s not who you want to be.</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: He wants to talk to you by the way. I told
him I’d tell you.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You and Jackie were talking about me?</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: Not about you. We were talking. He said he
wanted to talk to you about something.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’m taking you shopping tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: I went shopping today.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You go shopping every day. Like a girl.</p>
<p><strong>joe louis</strong>: It’s a tax thing. It’s a mistake my
lawyers will straighten out, but for the time being it’s a headache
-</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: How much you owe?</p>
<p><strong>joe louis</strong>: It’s nothing, like - fifty grand.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Sure. Don’t worry about it.</p>
<p><strong>joe louis</strong>: Thank you. I’ll pay you back soon as
-</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Joe. It’s a gift. Not a loan. You don’t owe
me nothing.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: Hi. I’m Ana.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’m Frank.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: You’re Frank and this is your place. Why’s it
called Small’s? Why don’t you call it Frank’s?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Because I don’t have to.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: I’m reluctant to bring anyone in I don’t
personally know.</p>
<p><strong>spearman</strong>: You know me, and I vouch for them.</p>
<p><strong>spearman</strong>: Richie, we work together. You want me, you
got to take them, too.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Where are they?</p>
<p><strong>spearman</strong>: That’s Jones. With the skinny white
woman.</p>
<p><strong>spearman</strong>: That’s Abruzzo, with the fat black
one.</p>
<p><strong>spearman</strong>: Both are good with wires. Have good
informants. They’re honest. And they’re fearless. They’ll do anything.
They’re insane, Richie, like you.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I got it.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I hope you weren’t waiting long. A woman as
beautiful as you shouldn’t have to wait for anything.</p>
<p><strong>104 int. mama lucas’s teaneck, n.j. house - day 104</strong>:
Ana considers some family photographs on a mantle.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: This is your father?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You really don’t know who that is? It’s
Martin Luther King.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: It is not.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You’re right. He was as important as
Dr. King, though.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: What’d he do?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: A lot of things. He had a lot of friends. He
served New York and it served him.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: What was he to you?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Teacher.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: What’d he teach you?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: How to take my time … how if you’re going to
do something, do it with care … do it with love.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: Anything else?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: How be a gentleman.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: That’s what you are?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I got five different apartments in the city I
could’ve taken you to. I brought you here instead -</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: To meet my mother.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lucas</strong>: Is this her? Oh, she’s beautiful, Frank.
Look at her. She’s an angel come down from heaven.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Our mandate is to make major arrests. No
street guys - we want the suppliers - the distributors.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Heroin, cocaine, amphetamines. No grass
under a thousand pounds. Less than that, someone else can waste their
time.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: We’ll be handling big shipments, big money,
big temptation. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: There’s a story about you. About turning in
some money. A lot of money. Is it true?</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: It’s not true.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Stuff’s ten percent pure. Strong enough to
smoke for all those suburban white kids afraid of needles.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: You paid ten bucks for it?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: And it’s all that’s out there.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Now, how is that possible? Who can afford to
sell shit twice as good for half as much?</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: We’re going to be here all night if we count
every bill.</p>
<p><strong>time cut</strong>: A money-counting machine flips through the
bills, its counter flying. The brothers rubberband it all in $100,000
decks. Jot down the numbers. Put the money in newly-assembled file
boxes. Tape them shut.</p>
<p><strong>banker</strong>: You got a stockbroker, Frank?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I deal with enough crooks as it is.</p>
<p><strong>banker</strong>: This one couldn’t be more honest. Ask
around. He’s got a lot of clients in the business. You can’t leave all
your money in safety deposit boxes; give him a call.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Frank. This is Mike Sibota.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Mr. Sibota. What can I get you?</p>
<p><strong>sibota</strong>: A left-hander from what Charlie tells me.
Your nephew?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It’s been his dream all his life to play for
the Yankees - and he’s good enough.</p>
<p><strong>sibota</strong>: So I hear. You have him come see me. We’ll
give him a try-out.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: What’s this? Oh, that’s it, I’m taking
you in.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You can’t take me in for that, I got a
license for that, motherfucker.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: This then - But first -</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: All right, now I’m arresting you.</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: Let him go. This is for you.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: What is that, a bribe? Oh, now you’re all
under arrest.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: What is that?</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: I’m taking you all in.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I said, what the fuck was that?</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: What was what?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Oh, he’s all right. I just shot him in the
leg. You got a health plan, what are you complaining about. He’s fine.
Here - Five hundred all right? Six? Look, he’s feeling better all the
time.</p>
<p><strong>133 int. frank’s penthouse apartment - night 133</strong>: As
Ana tries to clean the blood stain on the rug with salt and soda water,
Frank sits with his five brothers in the debris-strewn aftermath of the
party. Silence before:</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I can’t have this kind of stupidity.</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: It was an accident. He feels terrible about
it.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: He doesn’t feel shit, coked up all the time.
Get rid of him.</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: Frank. He’s your cousin. What’s he gonna do?
Go back home? I’ll talk to him. I’ll straighten him out.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Gimme those glasses.</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: What? Why?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Ice Pick Paul goes here -</p>
<p><strong>abruzzo</strong>: No, he’s under Benny Two-Socks -</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: No, you’re thinking of Benny the Bishop.
Benny Two-Socks is Tosca’s deadbeat son- in-law.</p>
<p><strong>spearman</strong>: Jonesy’s right.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: What’re you doing? We just -</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: For a cop the uppermost thing is the arrest.
For a prosecutor, the arrest is nothing without the evidence to convict.
We don’t have any real evidence on anyone on this board, so they’re
coming down. We’re starting over from the street.</p>
<p><strong>abruzzo</strong>: What are you, a prosecutor all of a
sudden?</p>
<p><strong>phone voice</strong>: Those snow tires you give me last time
come in yet? I’m going to want some more of them, gimme one and a half
more of them.</p>
<p><strong>toback</strong>: This is more than a year’s salary, Richie.
If it disappears, I won’t be able to get it for you again.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: It’ll never be out of my sight.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: It’s got to be `Blue Magic.’</p>
<p><strong>mechanic</strong>: Yeah, yeah, it’s `Blue.’ You can pick it
up here tomorrow. Where’s the rest of the money?</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: That’s half. I’ll give you the other half
tomorrow when you give -</p>
<p><strong>mechanic</strong>: No, no, no, I don’t do that. Go fuck
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>143 int/ext. spearman’s car - moving - near gw bridge - day
143</strong>: Spearman watches the pickup truck driven by the mechanic
change lanes up ahead - heading for the George Washington Bridge - and
glances over concerned to Richie, who is changing the cashmere sweater
for an old t-shirt.</p>
<p><strong>spearman</strong>: He’s going into New York. Are we?</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: What are they going to do, arrest us?</p>
<p><strong>spearman</strong>: They could. New York cops. They can do
worse than that.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: We’re not losing that money. Go.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Get out.</p>
<p><strong>taxi driver</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Get the fuck out of the car!</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: That’s my money.</p>
<p><strong>siu det 1</strong>: The fuck are you. What money?</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: The bills are sequenced and registered with
the Essex County Prosecutors Office. All begin with CF3500. Take a
look.</p>
<p><strong>siu det. 2</strong>: Goddamn it, I thought we had a score. I
thought I had a fucking Chris-Craft sitting in my driveway.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Honest mistake. Just give it back to me.</p>
<p><strong>siu det. 1</strong>: This time.</p>
<p><strong>trupo</strong>: When’s the last time I was in Jersey? Let me
think. Never. What’re you doing coming over here without letting anybody
know? You don’t know you can get hurt doing that?</p>
<p><strong>trupo</strong>: You got your money. Now, never, ever, come
into the city again unannounced. You come in to see a fuckin Broadway
show you call ahead first to see if it’s okay with me.</p>
<p><strong>toback v.o.</strong>: What do we hate most? Isn’t it the
transgressions of others we fear we’re capable of ourselves?</p>
<p><strong>toback</strong>: Richie - cops are like -</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Yeah, I know, like everyone else. Some of
them will steal no matter what. There can be a camera on them they’ll do
it. Some’ll never do it. The rest are capable of either, depending how
their department leans … Only theirs isn’t leaning, it’s fallen over.
The patrol cars don’t even stop in Harlem, just roll down the window so
the dealers can throw the money in. I saw drops made on precinct
steps.</p>
<p><strong>toback</strong>: What were you doing there?</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: It’s where this dope is coming from. Blue
Magic. Out of New York. What am I supposed to do, ignore it?</p>
<p><strong>toback</strong>: The cab driver’s filed aggravated assault
and grand theft charges -</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: He wouldn’t stop. Motherfucker almost ran me
over.</p>
<p><strong>toback</strong>: - which he may reconsider depending on the
amount the State of New Jersey offers to settle -</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: I told him I was a cop. I showed him my
identification.</p>
<p><strong>toback</strong>: You stole his cab and broke his arm.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: I was chasing your 20 thousand dollars.</p>
<p><strong>toback</strong>: I don’t want to hear about you going into
New York anymore.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Then my investigation’s over.</p>
<p><strong>toback</strong>: You’re not listening to me. I said: I don’t
want to hear about it … You do whatever you have to do, go wherever you
have to go to find out who’s bringing this shit into the country … Just
don’t tell me. Get some sleep.</p>
<p><strong>aa153 int. richie’s apartment - morning aa153</strong>:
Richie - in robe and underwear - opens the door to find a woman in the
hall holding a briefcase.</p>
<p><strong>vida</strong>: Mr. Roberts? I’m here for our appointment.</p>
<p><strong>vida</strong>: From Child Social Services?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: When you asked me to be your son’s godfather,
I took it very seriously.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: I said yes, I’d take on this responsibility,
take care of your son, God forbid something happened to you -</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Tony, the things she’s telling Child Social
Services make me look very bad: Out all night. Lowlife informants
hanging around. Women -</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Old friends like me.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: It’s all right. I understand. They ask me,
I’ll tell them what you want me to tell them. I’ll lie for you.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: What.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: You don’t have to talk about it, you don’t
want. What do you hear about Blue Magic? Anything?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: A lot of sorrow and misery from guys being put
out of business. That’s all.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Nothing about who’s bringing it in?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Guys down south is all I heard.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Down south, Florida? Cubans? What.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: I don’t know. All I can tell you is whoever it
is, they’re upsetting the natural order of things.</p>
<p><strong>tosca</strong>: Pull -</p>
<p><strong>mrs. tosca</strong>: The whole place was imported brick by
brick from Gloucestershire.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: It’s very nice.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Pull -</p>
<p><strong>tosca</strong>: She’s a lovely girl. You should marry
her.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Too many things to look after right now to
think about that.</p>
<p><strong>tosca</strong>: Frank. That’s a mistake. If I may say. Don’t
take her for granted, girl like that.</p>
<p><strong>tosca</strong>: You interested in history, Frank? The events
that have brought us to where we are today? You know who was? Bumpy.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Bumpy was interested in a lot of things.</p>
<p><strong>tosca</strong>: I always wonder if people know when history’s
being made. And what they’re doing at the time. This, for instance,
could be a historic moment, and you’re sipping a glass of ice water.</p>
<p><strong>tosca</strong>: Bumpy and I did a lot of business together,
as you know. Whatever he needed, he’d come to me and I’d do my best to
provide it. He came to me, I didn’t go to him, is the point I’m trying
to make. You know why?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: He didn’t have what you needed. You had what
he needed. We’ve always had to come to you.</p>
<p><strong>tosca</strong>: Yes. Until now.</p>
<p><strong>tosca</strong>: Monopolies are illegal in this country,
Frank, because no one can compete with a monopoly. If they let the dairy
farmers do that, half of them would go out of business tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’m just trying to make a living.</p>
<p><strong>tosca</strong>: Which is your right. Because this is America.
But not at the unreasonable expense of others. That’s un-American. You
know the price you pay for a gallon of milk doesn’t represent its true
cost of production. It’s controlled. Set.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I set a price I think is fair.</p>
<p><strong>tosca</strong>: It’s very unfair, in fact. Your customers are
happy, but what about your fellow dairy farmers? You’re not thinking of
them.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’m thinking of them as much as they ever
thought of me.</p>
<p><strong>tosca</strong>: All right. I can see you’re getting excited.
Don’t get excited. That’s not why I invited you to my home. To get
excited.</p>
<p><strong>tosca</strong>: Here, I got something for you.</p>
<p><strong>tosca</strong>: Now what if - I’m just thinking out loud -
you sold some of your inventory wholesale and I helped with the
distribution.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I don’t need it. I already got everything
from 110th Street to Yankee Stadium, river to river.</p>
<p><strong>tosca</strong>: Which is a little mom and pop store compared
to what I’m talking about. I could make you bigger than K-Mart. L.A.,
Chicago, Detroit, Vegas. I’m speaking nationwide. And I’d guarantee you
peace of mind. You know what I mean by that.</p>
<p><strong>tosca</strong>: Frank. You can see I’m a Renaissance man.
Unfortunately not all my people are as enlightened. Ask them, What is
civil rights, they don’t know. They’re not as open to change from the
way things are done and who’s doing it. But I can talk to them so there
won’t be any misunderstanding. That’s what I mean by peace of mind.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You pay what a kilo now, 75, 80? I’d consider
50. And I can get you as much as you want.</p>
<p><strong>tosca</strong>: You see, I was right. This is a historic
moment. You’re going to be bigger than Bumpy himself.</p>
<p><strong>tosca</strong>: Can’t smoke it here, unfortunately. Grace
doesn’t like it. Take it with you.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: Why would you trust these people, the way they
look at you?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: They look at me like it’s Christmas and I’m
Santa Claus.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: They looked at us like we’re the help.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: No. They’re working for me now.</p>
<p><strong>a tv</strong>: Muhammad Ali, the black man’s black man, and
Joe Frazier, the white man’s black man, at their 1971 Madison Square
Garden press conference where Ali says as much.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: I bought you something, too.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: Come on. You look great. You want to miss the
fight? Come on.</p>
<p><strong>joe louis</strong>: Excuse me -</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Mr. Louis -</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: I’m sorry, but I just have to tell you, sir,
you were a hero to me growing up. I still push elevator buttons eight
times for the rounds you beat Billy Conn in. For luck.</p>
<p><strong>tosca</strong>: Hey, Frank, you keep that hat on, I’m gonna
miss the fight -</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: That’s is the plate number on the limo.
Check with the company, who rented it.</p>
<p><strong>spearman</strong>: He’s a supplier at most. Or just a pimp.
We’d’ve heard of him otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: No, he’s bigger than that. His seats were
phenomenal; better than Al Tosca’s. Joe Louis and Ali shook his fuckin
hand.</p>
<p><strong>richie v/o</strong>: His name is Frank Lucas …</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Originally from Greensboro, North Carolina.
Couple of arrests years ago. Gambling, robbery, unlicensed firearm.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: For fifteen years he was Bumpy Johnson’s
collector, bodyguard and driver. He was with him when he died.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Five brothers, he’s the oldest, lots of
cousins, all living here now, spread out around the boroughs and Jersey.
The brothers are -</p>
<p><strong>richie v/o</strong>: Eugene Lucas in Brooklyn -</p>
<p><strong>richie v/o</strong>: Earl Lucas in Newark -</p>
<p><strong>175 int. metal door shop - day 175</strong>: Another brother
at the register, hands Abruzzo a receipt -</p>
<p><strong>richie v/o</strong>: Lester Lucas in Queens -</p>
<p><strong>richie v/o</strong>: Turner Lucas, the Bronx -</p>
<p><strong>richie v/o</strong>: And Teddy Lucas, in Bergen County.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Except for the chinchilla coat, which no one
can explain, Frank’s life seems orderly and legitimate.</p>
<p><strong>richie v/o</strong>: He gets up early. Five a.m.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Has breakfast at a Midtown place, usually
alone.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Then goes to work. Meeting with his
accountant, or lawyer, dropping in on one of the several office
buildings he owns.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Nights, he usually stays home. When he does
go out, it’s to a club or dinner - with his new wife - friends,
celebrities, sports figures - never O.C. guys.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Sundays he takes his mother to church. Then
drives out to change the flowers on Bumpy’s grave. Every Sunday, no
matter what.</p>
<p><strong>191 ext. baptist church - day 191</strong>: As a photographer
takes the official photograph of the wedding party on the steps of the
church -</p>
<p><strong>toback</strong>: Not your typical day in the life of a dope
man, Richie.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Neither was Bumpy Johnson’s and he owned
Harlem.</p>
<p><strong>toback</strong>: You think Frank Lucas took over for Bumpy
Johnson? His driver? That’s a little far-fetched.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Is it? Everything he does, he does like
Bumpy.</p>
<p><strong>toback</strong>: Bumpy never wore a chinchilla coat in his
life.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: We haven’t seen that again. That apparently
has been retired to the closet.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: She’s the most beautiful bride I ever saw,
Frank.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I wish Bumpy could’ve met her. I wish she
could’ve met him.</p>
<p><strong>toback</strong>: What do you got on him you can use in court?
Because this isn’t it. You try this without informants and powder, no
one’s going to jail.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Won’t get any informants. Not inside. It’s
like a Sicilian family. Like he’s structured his own family the same way
to protect himself.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Being with Bumpy long as he was, he would
have been around Italians a lot. Enough to learn that much.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: But it’s not even Frank Lucas I want. I want
to know who he’s working for: Which Italians are bringing the heroin
in.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Stay in the car</p>
<p><strong>trupo</strong>: Hello, Frank.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Detective.</p>
<p><strong>trupo</strong>: You sure you done the right thing? She’s a
beautiful girl - there’s no question - but she’s got an attitude on
-</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Listen to me. Before you say another word -
about her - or me - remember that you’re saying it on the most important
fuckin day of my life.</p>
<p><strong>trupo</strong>: Man walks around in a fifty thousand dollar
chinchilla coat and he never even bought me a cup of coffee? Something
wrong there.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I don’t know what you’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>trupo</strong>: You pay your bills, Frank?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You want to keep talking, talk to my lawyer,
here’s his card. You call him, because we’re done here -</p>
<p><strong>trupo</strong>: Do you pay your bills, I asked you.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: If you’re not getting your share, it’s not my
fault, go ask the chief of police.</p>
<p><strong>trupo</strong>: What’s my share? You don’t even know me.
Maybe I’m special.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: No, you’re all the fuckin same.</p>
<p><strong>trupo</strong>: What does that say? Special - Investigations
- Unit. See that word there? “Special.” Ten grand, first of each month,
delivered here.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Detective … There are some things you don’t
do. This is one of them. Not on a man’s wedding day.</p>
<p><strong>trupo</strong>: Have a nice honeymoon.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Where is it?</p>
<p><strong>darylynn</strong>: Fuck you, I’m not telling you.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Where is my fuckin dope? You and your
girlfriends take it again? I’ll fuckin kill you.</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: Richie, yes, fuck me like a cop, not a
lawyer - Oh, God, Richie, no - don’t answer it - No, no, no -</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Yeah -</p>
<p><strong>spearman v/o phone</strong>: Richie. Newark just picked up
one of the celebrities on our Wall of Fame: Teddy’s driver. For
attempted murder.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Because it’s an attempted homicide, that’s
Grand Jury. Now, that Grand Jury could come in very favorably. Might
turn out to be Attempted Manslaughter. Self Defense even. She had a
knife. Depends on how I want to deal with you. You see where this is
going.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: The fuck is this place?</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Let’s say you beat it somehow. What do you
think Cousin Frank’ll think of that? He knows you had to sit here
listening to something like this. And then you beat an attempted murder?
Is he stupid? He’ll assume you talked.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: You fucked up, Jimmy. But nobody knows.
Frank doesn’t know. Yet. Do you want him to read about it in the paper?
Or do you want to walk out of here - no bail, no trial - just walk out,
now.</p>
<p><strong>richie v/o</strong>: Jimmy? Look at me -</p>
<p><strong>richie v/o</strong>: Any time I want to change my mind? I
don’t like the quality of your work? I can find a witness saw you shoot
your girlfriend. It just took me a while. I even know what he’ll look
like. He’ll look just like you.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Stevie. Come over here. I heard you didn’t
show up.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You’re too busy to meet with Billy Martin?
After I set it up?</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: I don’t want to play pro ball, I
decided.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What’re you talking about? This is your dream
since you were their age - Maybe I can set it up again.</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: It’s not what I want. I want to do what you
do, Uncle Frank. I want to be you.</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: We got a problem.</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: He’s been cutting it so much it’s down to
two, three percent pure.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You tested it. You’re sure.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: The fuck you looking at?</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Frank. Welcome.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: We need to talk.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Great. Girls, get out.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: You talked to Charlie. You want to hear more
about my Black Coalition. Let me explain it to you -</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: That’s not why I’m here. Everybody’s happy,
Jackie. Charlie, Baz, the cops, the Italians, everybody. Everybody
except you.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: I’m happy.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Then I don’t understand. Why do you have to
take something that’s perfectly good the way it is, and wreck it?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Brand names mean something, Jackie. Consumers
rely on them to know what they’re getting. They know the company isn’t
going to try to fool them with an inferior product. They buy a Ford,
they know they’re gonna get a Ford.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Not a fuckin Datsun. Blue Magic is a brand
name; as much a brand name as Pepsi. I own it. I stand behind it. I
guarantee it and people know that even if they don’t know me any more
than they know the chairman of General Foods.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: What the fuck are you talking about,
Frank?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What you’re doing, as far as I’m concerned,
when you chop my dope down to five percent, is trademark
infringement.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: With all due respect, Frank, if I buy
something, I can do whatever I want with it.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: That’s not true. That’s where you’re
wrong.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: If I buy a car, I can paint it, God damn
it.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Jackie, you don’t need to. You don’t need to
make more money than you can with Blue the way it is. No one does. At a
certain point it’s just greed.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: What do you want, Frank? You want me to call
it something else?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I have to insist. You call it Blue Magic,
that’s misrepresentation.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Fine. I’ll call it Red Magic, even though it
doesn’t sound as good.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: That’s all I’m saying. Wrap it in red
cellophane and -</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Pink Magic. Black Magic -</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Whack it down to nothing, tie a bow around it
and call it Blue Dogshit if you want, just don’t let me catch you doing
this again.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Catch me? Insist? Infringement? I don’t like
these words as much as please - thank you - sorry to bother you, Jackie.
These are better words to use you come into my place without an
invitation.</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: Give me the keys; take a cab home.</p>
<p><strong>222 int. teddy’s car - moving - night 222</strong>: Frank and
Teddy driving in silence. Eventually -</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You don’t go over there any more.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It’s all right, pull over, what are they
going to do? Give us a ticket?</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: Frank? Some of it’s in the trunk.</p>
<p><strong>trupo</strong>: Hello, Frank.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Detective. How’s it going? You have a nice
Thanksgiving?</p>
<p><strong>trupo</strong>: I did not, as a matter of fact. Get out of
the car.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Where’s the Shelby?</p>
<p><strong>trupo</strong>: The Shelby’s gone, Frank.</p>
<p><strong>trupo</strong>: Want to come over here a minute, Frank?</p>
<p><strong>trupo</strong>: Now what are we gonna do about this?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: We’re gonna shut the trunk and say good
night, forget you pulled us over.</p>
<p><strong>trupo</strong>: I got a better idea.</p>
<p><strong>trupo</strong>: Or would you rather I took it all and threw
you and your brother in the fuckin river?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I don’t know, would you rather it’s your
fuckin house blows up next time?</p>
<p><strong>trupo</strong>: I loved that car.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>trupo</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Don’t you ever put me in a car with dope in
it.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Yeah. Tony. How’s it going?</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: The fuck is a `micro’ wave?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: It’s a scientific force like atomic energy. It
rearranges the molecules.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Of what.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Of anything. Of popcorn. You don’t want to put
your head in there.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: I can get you one of these. Just like this,
brand new. I’ll have it delivered.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: No, thanks. I don’t want one.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: This is nice, where’s this?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Aspen. Just got back. Had a great time.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: I’d like to ski Aspen some day.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Know who we met? Burt Reynolds. I’m not
kidding. Lot of people from Hollywood go up there now, buying up
everything.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: This is your place?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Are you kidding? You know what it’s worth?
Ski-in-ski-out, five bedrooms, sauna, everything. We were guests. No …
No, that’s your place.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Isn’t there something we can do - about
leaving the big guy alone? You know who I mean.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: If I don’t report what you just said to me,
you know I could be in a lot of trouble. If I do, then it’s you.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: I’m hoping you won’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: I’m not taping it. How do you know? Because
we’re friends and I’m telling you. This is a real offer.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: From who, your uncle? Why would you do this?
Why would you risk our friendship?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Because I care what happens to you.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: You shouldn’t have done it.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: I had to. I had no choice. Neither do you.
Leave Frank Lucas alone.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: He’s not important enough for you to do
this.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Yes, he is.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Tell Marie I’m sorry I had to leave. You can
tell her why.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: INS, FBI, IRS - I can’t get anything out of
them. Nothing on his travel, his bank accounts, property holdings -
nothing.</p>
<p><strong>toback</strong>: That’s because they all think you’re on the
take and you think they are.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: They don’t want this to stop. It employs too
many people. Cops, lawyers, judges, probation officers, prison guards.
The day dope stops coming into this country, a hundred thousand people
lose their jobs.</p>
<p><strong>spearman</strong>: Richie. Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Who took it out? If there’s a contract on
me, it would be nice to know who took it out.</p>
<p><strong>fbi agent</strong>: We can’t say without compromising our
source. You understand.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: No. I don’t. Not when it’s my life.</p>
<p><strong>fbi agent</strong>: If you want, we can assign someone to
you.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Who? FBI? You’re going to protect me?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Don’t shoot! For God’s sake.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Talk.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Are you Richard Roberts? I got a subpoena.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Laurie. I’m sorry I couldn’t give you the
kind of life you wanted. I’m sorry it was never enough. But don’t punish
me for being honest. Don’t take my son away.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: What are you saying? That because you were
“honest” and didn’t take money like every other cop, I left you?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: You don’t take money for one reason: to buy
being dishonest about everything else. And that’s worse than taking
money nobody gives a shit about - drug money, gambling money nobody’s
gonna miss. I’d rather you took it and been honest with me. Or don’t
take it, I don’t care. But don’t then go cheat on me. Don’t cheat on
your kid by never being around. Don’t go out and get laid by your
snitches and secretaries and strippers. I can tell just by looking,
she’s one of them.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: You think you’re going to heaven because
your “honest.” You’re not. You’re going to the same hell as the crooked
cops you can’t stand.</p>
<p><strong>bailiff</strong>: All rise -</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: Your honor, a lot has been said here today
about how unsavory Mr. Roberts’ environment is for a child. How
dangerous it is. I’m sorry, but this is our world. This is where we live
and we tell him, Protect us. We give him that responsibility, and then
say, Oh, but we don’t trust you to raise a child. We don’t think you’re
fit for that.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: You’re right. This is no place for him.
Around me. Take him. The further away the better. For him.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Frank -</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Yeah, I see them.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Here you go, boys. Merry Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Paying cops is one thing, I understand that.
I been paying them since I was ten - put more of their kids through
college than the National Merit Award. This is different, this Special
Investigations Unit. They think they are special.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: They’re fucking crooks. No code of
ethics.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Someone’s been following me. Besides cops. I
see cars where they shouldn’t be. Guys I don’t know -</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Me, too.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Bumpy hardly ever went out at a certain
point. He stayed in - read - watched TV - played chess. I thought he
chose to lead a quiet life. He didn’t. He couldn’t go out without
something happening.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: We can still go out.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Where? With who? Everyone I know is under
surveillance. I can’t even be with my family at Christmas anymore.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: Why don’t you just pay who you have to pay?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I do pay them, I pay them all. Cops,
accountants, lawyers, who don’t I pay? Everybody. I pay them a fortune,
it doesn’t matter. It doesn’t satisfy them. The more you pay, the more
they expect.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You can’t start with them because they can’t
stop. It’s like dope. They always want more.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Put on something nice, we’re going out.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Keep going.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Around back?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Fuck that. I’m not going to sneak into my own
club. Just drive.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: I’m going to wait in the car.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Go ahead, Frank. I’ll wait for it.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You can carry it all? We ordered a lot.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Don’t forget the yellow sauce.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Doc’s got the keys. Let’s go back.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: The lights give me a headache, you go.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’m not leaving you on the street.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: Get the keys, Frank, it’s cold.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Gimme some of that yellow sauce.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: You hit?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What the fuck was that?</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: Was it Jackie? I’ll fuckin kill him whether
it was or not, you tell me to. What do you want us to do, Frank? We
can’t just sit here and -</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Who didn’t like Charlie? Everybody liked
Charlie …</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: Who shot at us? It doesn’t matter. We’re
leaving.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Go home. Go see your kids.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What are you doing? Where’ve you been?</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: We’re leaving from here. Money’s in the
car.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What money?</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: Everything from your mother’s house.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: In your car?</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Where’s the car?</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: Out front.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: With ten million dollars in it?</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: I didn’t count it.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Are you crazy? Take it back to Teaneck. What
are you doing driving around without security? Doc’ll take you back.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: We’re not going there, we’re going to the
airport. We’re leaving the country.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: To go where? No, we’re not.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: Frank, Charlie’s dead. They tried to kill us.
What else has to happen - ?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Shhh. Come on, now. Shhh.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Where are we going to go? Spain? China? Which
fuckin place is it going to be?</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: We can go anywhere we want. We can live
anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: We can run and hide is what you’re
saying.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: This is where I’m from. This is where my
family is. My business. My mother. This is my place. This is my country.
This is America.</p>
<p><strong>spearman</strong>: Said he’ll only talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>trupo</strong>: From what I hear, it was the Corsicans. The
French Connection, Fernando Rey, the exporters Frank has put out of
business. Now, I can take care of him in New York, but I don’t want to
have to worry every time he drives across the bridge to Jersey someone’s
gonna take another shot at him.</p>
<p><strong>trupo</strong>: We need to start working together. We need to
step up our efforts. Next time their aim could be better. We need to
keep this cash cow alive.</p>
<p><strong>trupo</strong>: Jesus. What the fuck you doing here? You
actually going to arrest Frank Lucas? What’s the matter with you?</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: I’m crazy. Can’t you tell that? I’m crazy
enough to shoot someone and make it look like an accident next time he
comes over the bridge without my permission. Get the fuck out of New
Jersey.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: “I can guarantee you peace of mind,” you
said. Do I look like a man with peace of mind to you? They shot at my
wife. Who does that?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Who was it, which one of your people? I’ll
take that gun away and shove it up their ass.</p>
<p><strong>tosca</strong>: I don’t know that it was any of them, Frank.
Neither do you.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Then maybe I’ll kill them all just to make a
fuckin point.</p>
<p><strong>tosca</strong>: You want to know who it was? I can tell you.
It was a junkie. Or a rival. Or some dumb ass kid trying to make a name
for himself. Or someone you forgot to pay off. Or slighted without
realizing it. Or someone you put out of business by being too
successful. Success has a lot of enemies. Your success is who took a
shot at you. How you gonna kill it? By being unsuccessful? You can be
successful and have enemies, or unsuccessful and have friends. It’s the
choice we make.</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’m watching the news. Where the hell’s
everyone going?</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: Home. The war’s over.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Just like that? We’re going to leave the
fuckin country to the communists?</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: We been here since 1961, Frank.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I haven’t!</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Opium plants are hearty enough to outlive
any war. They’ll still be here long after the troops are gone. But what
are you going to do for transportation when the last US plane goes
home?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’ll figure something out. You’ll see me
again.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: It’s not in my best interest to say this,
Frank … but quitting while you’re ahead is not the same as quitting.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: That’s what my wife thinks.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: But you don’t think she’s right.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Give them half!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Cut half of them loose! The mules!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Newark. Short Term Parking Lot 3.</p>
<p><strong>teddy v/o</strong>: When you need it? Today?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Tomorrow will be fine.</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: Short Term Lot 3. This the Mustang were
talking about … Camero? … What’s the plate number? Yeah, I got it … I
got it, Frank …</p>
<p><strong>abruzzo</strong>: There’s no Short Term Lot 3 at Newark.
They’re lettered, A, B, C, D -</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I’m just telling you what I heard -</p>
<p><strong>abruzzo</strong>: Then you heard wrong!</p>
<p><strong>spearman</strong>: Maybe he means the time? 3 o’clock?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: And this isn’t a Jersey plate. Or New York.
Not with just two letters. It’s three and three, not two and three -</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: It’s what he said -</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Then what the fuck is it -</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: The fuck should I know -</p>
<p><strong>abruzzo</strong>: You’re fuckin lying -</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: It’s what he said. I’m sure.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: None of you ever been in the service? It’s
an Air Force tail number.</p>
<p><strong>277 ext. newark airport - continued 277</strong>: The cabin
door slides up, the passengers begin emerging: Military officers,
embassy personnel and families. Richie’s detectives and Toback watch him
with concern as the official passengers, met by a bevy of assistants,
file past -</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Captain, I’m Richard Roberts, Director of
the Essex County Narcotics Bureau.</p>
<p><strong>trupo</strong>: Your husband’s illustrious career is over.
The Feds are going to come in and take it all. Everything. But not
before I get my gratuity. Where’s the money?</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: There was some on that dresser, but it’s gone
now so I guess you -</p>
<p><strong>trupo</strong>: The money! The getaway money Frank and every
other gangster keeps in his house!</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: If you leave now, there’s a chance Frank might
not kill you -</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>289 int/ext. mama lucas’s teaneck, n.j. house - day
289</strong>: Frank’s bedroom has been destroyed. Trupo, standing at a
window glances out at the sound of a barking of a dog to see Frank’s
German shepherd down in its kennel.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Open it.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: The warrant permits me to search the plane
and its cargo.</p>
<p><strong>army captain</strong>: But you don’t have my permission.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: I don’t need it.</p>
<p><strong>295 ext. mama lucas’s teaneck, n.j. house - continued
295</strong>: Trupo comes around to the front of the kennel again with
his gun out and aims it at the dog. As he fires -</p>
<p><strong>us attorney</strong>: That’s enough.</p>
<p><strong>us attorney</strong>: That was a military transport plane. If
there was heroin on board then someone in the military would have to be
involved. Which means that even as it fights a war that’s claimed 50,000
Americans lives, the military is smuggling narcotics.</p>
<p><strong>us attorney</strong>: That’s how these events are being
interpreted by General Easton in that call to me. That someone employed
by the this office believes the United States Army is in the drug
trafficking business - and is trying to prove it by desecrating the
remains of young men who’ve given their lives in the defence of
democracy.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: There are drugs on that plane -</p>
<p><strong>us attorney</strong>: Shut the fuck up.</p>
<p><strong>us attorney</strong>: Is it any wonder then, because of your
actions, the entire federal narcotics program is now in jeopardy of
being dismantled as completely and enthusiastic- ally as that fucking
transport plane? That’s what you’ve accomplished Mr. Roberts.
Single-handedly.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: I had good information the target of my
investigation was bringing dope in on that plane.</p>
<p><strong>us attorney</strong>: And that target is?</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Frank Lucas.</p>
<p><strong>us attorney</strong>: Who? Who’s Frank Lucas? Who’s he work
for? Which family?</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: He’s not Italian. He’s black.</p>
<p><strong>us attorney</strong>: Is that supposed to be some kind of
joke? You’re this close to the end of your career in law enforcement,
you’re making jokes?</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: I believe Frank Lucas is above the mafia in
the dope business. I believe he buys direct from the source in Southeast
Asia, cuts out all the middlemen, and uses US military planes and
personnel to bring pure No. 4 heroin into United States.</p>
<p><strong>toback</strong>: Richie has a lot of experience -</p>
<p><strong>us attorney</strong>: Does he. And how many arrests has he
made in his so-called investigation?</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: I was promised when I took this job, it was
about real arrests.</p>
<p><strong>us attorney</strong>: Does that mean `none?’</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: I have cases against most of Frank’s
organization. Not him -</p>
<p><strong>us attorney</strong>: Frank’s organization -</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>us attorney</strong>: No fucking nigger has accomplished what
the American Mafia hasn’t in a hundred years!</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Yeah, you’d know, sitting here, having never
been on the -</p>
<p><strong>us attorney</strong>: Lou, get this fucking kike out of here
-</p>
<p><strong>toback</strong>: He was out of line, Richie.</p>
<p><strong>toback</strong>: It’s over. You’re shut down.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Ten million dollars means nothing to me.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: This - is his death warrant.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lucas</strong>: Frankie -</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lucas</strong>: Sit down.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lucas</strong>: If you’d have been a preacher, your
brothers would be preachers. If you’d been a soldier, they’d be
soldiers. Do you know that? They all came here because of you. You
called and they came running. They look up to you. They expect you to
always know what’s best. But even they know you don’t shoot cops. Even I
know that. Ana knows it. You seem to be the only one who doesn’t.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Is that where I’m going?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lucas</strong>: I never asked you where all this came
from because I didn’t want to hear you lie to me. Don’t lie to me. Don’t
do that, too.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lucas</strong>: Do you really want to make things so bad
for your family they’ll leave you? Because they will. She will - I know
I will.</p>
<p><strong>319 int/ext. richie’s car - moving - near gw bridge -
morning19</strong>: 3</p>
<p><strong>toback</strong>: Where is it?</p>
<p><strong>richie v/o</strong>: Somewhere in the South tower.</p>
<p><strong>toback</strong>: You know that it’s there. You’re sure.</p>
<p><strong>richie v/o</strong>: Positive.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Lou. We’re ready to go in there knowing
there’s a good chance we won’t all come out. That’s what we’re willing
to do. All I’m asking you to do get me a warrant.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: We don’t have a lot of time to fuck around
-</p>
<p><strong>toback v/o</strong>: I’ll call in the warrant. And some
backup. Don’t go in before either gets there.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: How long we gonna wait for it?</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: It’ll be here.</p>
<p><strong>329 int. apartment, the projects - morning 329</strong>: A
paper-cutter blade slices a sheet of blue cellophane. The girls at the
tables, with the expertise of Cuban cigar makers, wrap pieces of the
cellophane like tobacco leaves around precisely-measured 1/4-ounce
drifts of Black Magic.</p>
<p><strong>spearman</strong>: I got to talk to Teddy.</p>
<p><strong>guy with gun</strong>: Get the fuck out of here.</p>
<p><strong>spearman</strong>: What the fuck is that? I got business with
Teddy and it’s none of your fuckin business except to knock on the
fuckin door and get him.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: What kind of trees are these?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You think you got Frank Lucas. You got
nothing.</p>
<p><strong>a342 int. richie’s apartment - day a342</strong>: Richie cuts
the tags off a new, inexpensive suit. Slips the jacket on, which seemed
somehow to fit a little better at the store. Cuts the tags off a
tie.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Mr. Roberts -</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Thank you, your Honor. Ladies and gentlemen
-</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Here he is, let me talk to him alone.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I just heard something. I said it couldn’t be
true. You didn’t really turn in a million dollars you found in the trunk
of a car, did you?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Want me to tell you what happened to it? It
ended up in cops’ pockets.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Maybe? No. It did. All you did was give it to
them for nothing in return. Not nothing: You got their contempt.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Why’d you do that? What’re you trying to
prove, you’re better than them? You’re not better than them. You are
them.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: I don’t have the time or interest to listen
to -</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You did it because it was right. That’s all.
Why’s that hard to say? The question is would you do it again? That was
a long time ago. It’d be very easy to find out. Tell me you want to find
out, tell me the address, and a car will be there, the trunk loaded.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: No, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Who the fuck are you to say no to that? You
think that impresses me?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Let me ask you something. You think by
putting me in jail, you’re going to stop even one junkie from dying?
Because you won’t. If it isn’t me, it’ll be someone else. With me or
without me, nothing’s going to change.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Then that’s the way it is.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You have any sort of case? Or just that idiot
drives for my brother. Is he your case? Because if it’s just him and the
powder, it’s not enough.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Then you got nothing to worry about.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: My brothers won’t talk to you. My cousins.
None of my family. No one but that mother fucking driver.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: I got more than that. I got a line of people
wanting to testify that stretches out the door and around the block.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Is it? Tony the Bug. Benny Two-Socks.
Carmine Camanetti.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Who the fuck are they? I don’t know them and
they don’t know me.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: They sell dope for the Mazzano crime family.
Which you all but put out of business.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: This is who you’re going to put on the stand?
Guys who don’t know me? Who got nothing to do with me?</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: They have everything to do with you. And the
only thing they hate more than you is what you represent.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I don’t represent nothing.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: You don’t? Black businessman like you? Of
course you do. But once you’re gone, things can return to normal.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Look at me. You looking? Can you tell by
looking it would mean nothing to me if tomorrow you turned up dead?</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Get in line. That one stretches around the
block, too.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What can we do?</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: You know what you have to do.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I could give you cops, but that’s not who you
want, is it. You want organized crime names.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: I’ll take them, too. I want them all.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You’ll take them, too? You’d go after cops?
Are you serious? You’d do that? Lock up your own kind?</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: They’re not. Not the ones in business with
you. They’re not my kind any more than the Italians are yours.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What can you promise me?</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: I can promise you if you lie to me about one
name, you’ll never get out of prison. Lie about one dollar in one
offshore account, you’ll never get out. You can live rich in jail the
rest of your life, or poor outside it, that’s what I can promise.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You know, I don’t care if the feds take all
my buildings, my stocks, my off-shore accounts. They can take it all, I
don’t care - use it to build battleships, paint bridges, whatever the
fuck they want. Fight another war. But those other motherfuckers - the
cops - put my money in their pockets. Millions.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: I believe it.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: I want to know everyone you’ve met for the
last twenty years. Everyone you sold to. Every cop you ever paid off.
Every one who ever stole from you. Every one you remember.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Oh, I remember them all. That’s not the
problem.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: What is?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: The jail’s aren’t big enough.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You go up here. Your “special.”</p>
<p><strong>351 a tv</strong>: A report on the indictments handed down by
the 351</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Frederick Douglass Boulevard? What was wrong
with just plain 8th Avenue?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I used to sit here with Ana in my old car.
She hated it. Now I don’t even have a car. Or her.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Just do what?</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: The fuck is that? Just do what?</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Sneakers. Expensive ones.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Who the fuck would buy those?</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Your brothers know you’re out?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I haven’t talked to them in years. It’s
better that way. For them. I don’t know where they are. Went back to
Greensboro when they got out, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What am I going to do now, be a janitor? What
do I know how to do? How am I going to live?</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: I told you I wouldn’t let you starve.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You told me but you can barely take care of
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You know, one phone call, Richie, I could be
back in business.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I won’t. I’m just saying I could.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Thanks for the clothes.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: You’re welcome.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Uh-oh. Look out. Here come the gangsters.</p>
<p><strong>gangsta 2</strong>: What.</p>
<p><strong>gangsta 1</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Every idiot gets to be young once.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Let’s get out of here.</p>
