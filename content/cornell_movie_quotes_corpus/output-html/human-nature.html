<h1 id="human-nature">human-nature</h1>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I’m not sorry.</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: I am sorry.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: I don’t even know what sorry means
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I’m not sorry. So I spend the rest of my life
in jail. So what? I’ve been in jail my whole life anyway. A jail of
blood and tissue and coursing hormones…</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: …a jail called the human body.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: My soul held prisoner in this reeking,
stench-ridden bag of bones and entrails. A bag of feces and piss and
fibroid cysts in my tits and precancerous moles on my sun-damaged
back…</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: At least now I’ll be able to blame the state,
not God, for my incarceration.</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: I am sorry, gentlemen, sorry for all of us.
Your’s is a complicated, sad world.</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: And I never knew that. I was living a life of
simplicity, of purity, when I was ripped out of my Eden and immersed in
this harshness. Some would argue that the life I was living was not a
human life at all. And, gentlemen, I don’t have any clever retort. I am
not a philosopher. The only thing I know is that I am sorry, sorry for
my expulsion from Eden, sorry for my Lila rotting in her jail cell, and
sorry for Nathan… rotting in his grave.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: I don’t even know what sorry means anymore.
It’s odd. When I was alive I knew – maybe it was all I knew – but here
sorry is meaningless. Love is meaningless. Jealousy is meaningless.
Ambition is meaningless. Everything that motivated my every breath while
I was alive is meaningless now. I guess that’s how I can be sure I’m
really dead.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: My story begins when I was twelve.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Something terrible happened when I was
twelve.</p>
<p><strong>kid brother</strong>: Hey, no fair!</p>
<p><strong>twelve year old lila</strong>: Drop dead, Eric.</p>
<p><strong>adult lila</strong>: Something terrible started to happen to
my body when I was twelve. My mother said because of it I would never be
able to get a man, so I should get used to the idea of dedicating my
life to the pursuit of knowledge, or religion… or whatever.</p>
<p><strong>adult lila</strong>: The doctor said…</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: It’s hormonal. Nature is a funny and complex
thing. It could get worse with time.</p>
<p><strong>twelve year old lila</strong>: By the time I was twenty I
looked like an ape.</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: I don’t think there’s anyone in the world who
doesn’t know by now that I was raised in the wilderness by an ape. Well,
to be fair, by a man who thought himself an ape, but it amounts to the
same thing gentlemen, does it not?</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: My father escaped from a New Jersey mental
institution in 1963.</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: He had been committed the previous year after
applying one too many times at our local zoo for the job of “apprentice
ape.”</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: My father saw what the human race had come to
while he was… in captivity. He felt something had to be done to create a
better world.</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: He stole little me from my mother, his
ex-wife, and raised me, with love and tenderness and respect, as an ape
like himself.</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: Apes don’t assassinate their presidents,
gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: Until quite recently I believed myself to be
an ape, although I didn’t know specifically what type. Apes don’t think
in terms of type.</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: It might be argued, gentlemen, that apes don’t
even know that they are apes. In retrospect, however, I’d say that I was
a pygmy chimp.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: I have to say I always hated apes. Of course
I don’t any longer. I don’t even know what hate means now. But while
alive, I hated apes. I blame my parents. I mean, I don’t blame them. I
don’t know what blame is, really, anymore, but I think they influenced
me in my ape-hating tendencies.</p>
<p><strong>nathan as a boy</strong>: Monkeys! Look, mama, monkeys!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Nathan, those are not monkeys. Those are
apes. Mountain Gorillas to be precise.</p>
<p><strong>puff’s father</strong>: I am not a human being! I am an
animal!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: And furthermore… Tell him, Harold.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Uh… We must never act like apes, son. For
you see, The ape is our closest biological relative – specifically the
pygmy chimp. A single chromosome separates us. But you know what truly
separates us from the apes, what makes us better than apes?</p>
<p><strong>nathan as a boy</strong>: No, papa. What?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Culture. Civilization. Refinement. If we do
not have these as humans, then we might as well be living in pens and
throwing our feces about, masturbating in public… …sniffing red swollen
female rump…</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Enough, Harold.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Oh, I had sexual urges. I had the urge to
merge, officers. Inside I was 100% Grade A female. But what
self-loathing I felt! Who would have someone as repulsive, as unladylike
as me? I did everything I could to shield the world from this
repulsiveness.</p>
<p><strong>female roommate</strong>: Lila, what are you doing in there?
I need to get ready for my date.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Nothing! I’ll be out in a minute!</p>
<p><strong>female roommate</strong>: Look, I’ll just… What the…?</p>
<p><strong>female roommate</strong>: I don’t know why you didn’t tell me
about this.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: It’s embarrassing, okay?</p>
<p><strong>female roommate</strong>: It’s not so bad. So, it just keeps
growing?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Yeah, Natalie. It’s hair. It grows.</p>
<p><strong>female roommate</strong>: Well, don’t jump down my throat.
I’m just trying to help.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: How is that helping, Natalie? How exactly?</p>
<p><strong>female roommate</strong>: Look, if you’re going to be like
that… You should be appreciative that I’m interested.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Why, because I’m a freak and you are
beautiful, and you are being nice enough to come down to my freak,
nonbeautiful level and act concerned about my repulsive troubles?</p>
<p><strong>female roommate</strong>: You’re fucked up, Lila. Why don’t
you fucking try electrolysis or something? Figure it out for
chrissake.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: At sixty dollars an hour, electrolysis was not
a feasible solution. I explored my alternatives.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I remember once coming across a painting of
Mary Magdalene entirely covered with fur. I guess that’s where I got the
idea that maybe the Catholic Church might be a place that encouraged
excessive hair growth in its women.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: So I became a nun.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Heavenly Father… …please let this hair go
away.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: But my prayers were always so selfish.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I tried being a lesbian separatist.</p>
<p><strong>lesbians</strong>: A woman without a man / Is like a fish
without a bicycle.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: But I guess I just wasn’t attracted to women,
even hostile, man-hating, hairy ones who wore sensible shoes.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: For a while I was a professional circus
freak.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: During the holiday season, they made us wear
costumes.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Ho ho ho.</p>
<p><strong>kid on her lap</strong>: That’s not real.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Ow! You little fuck.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Aside from the great dental, this occupation
was not pleasant.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: They say the holidays are difficult for a lot
of people.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I decided there was something poetic about
killing myself with a razor blade.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: The way that mouse looked at me. There was no
judgement. It didn’t care if I had hair all over my body. I was just
what I was. I felt so free. Do you understand what I’m saying?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Something about a mouse, right?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Birds and squirrels and rocks and trees didn’t
seem to judge my hair. I felt at peace when there were no humans around.
I figured out a way to spend as much time as possible with no people
around. I became a nature writer.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Last night I almost died on this mountain top,
and the irony is I had never felt more alive.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I knew it was coming when in late afternoon, a
thunderhead drifted over, sneaking in like kids through the back door of
a movie theater, forced casual. It turned the sky a queer shade of
green. A green that said “watch out, baby, this is gonna hurt like
hell.” I could’ve hightailed, but that would be cheating. Part of the
Nature experience is recognizing its mastery over you, your smallness in
the face of it.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: As Nietzsche said, what does not kill me makes
me stronger, and that goes double if you’re a woman.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I became a successful nature writer.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Then I became a famous nature writer. I said
to myself, fuck humanity…</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: …and I became a recluse. I had a menagerie of
animals at my house. They loved me because I was me. They loved me on
the days I shaved. They loved me on the days I didn’t. For a while this
was enough.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: By the time I was thirty I was very, very
horny.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I had to have a man in my… life. At any cost.
I would become what I needed to become to achieve this. I would become a
hairless lie.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I was rich enough for electrolysis by this
time, so I began the long arduous process of having each inappropriate
hair burned out of my body at the root.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: This is when everything changed, and this is
where my confession really begins.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Progress!</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Ouch. Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Oh yes, honey. Getting to be smooth smooth
smooth all over. Smooth as a baby’s butt.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I love it, Rose. I’m getting to be a real
girl.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: You still in the market for a real boy?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Always. Ow.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Cause there’s this guy. My brother knows him.
Might be right up your alley.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Tell me. I could use someone up my alley.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I don’t get that. Is that sexual?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Shut up and tell me.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Handsome, thirties, psychologist…</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Loves animals? Ouch. Must love animals,
Rose.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Loves animals. Loves you.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Somehow it came up that you were a friend of
mine. Mr. handsome, animal- loving psychologist said he would love to
meet you.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Holy shit. Your brother didn’t tell him about
the nature of our relationship, did he?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: My brother is discreet.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Won’t he be able to tell?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: My brother says the guy’s a thirty- five year
old virgin, so maybe he won’t know how women usually feel. Plus he’s got
bad eyesight, almost legally blind, which is helpful in this situation.
Plus he’s got an extremely small penis, of which he is “mortifyingly
ashamed”, so chances are he’ll be so grateful for any non- judgmental
attention, that he’ll be yours forever.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: God, he must be really close to your brother
to tell him such personal stuff.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Yeah, well my brother is his shrink.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Meditations on a Banana Slug was a
delightful read.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Thank you so much. I love slugs. All slugs,
not just banana slugs.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: As do I.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: They’re so even keel. They forge ahead with
slow determination. They don’t get distracted or side-tracked. They
don’t care what they look like. They don’t care that people look at them
and go, “Ewww. A slug.”</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: They don’t seem to be especially ego driven,
this is true.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: You’ve got to respect that.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: I have to say that I’m not there yet.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Slugdom. Sluggishness. Whatever you’d call
it. I’m not there yet. I still have many human characteristics.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: That’s not necessarily a bad thing.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Yes. I suppose not. But still. One would
like to move along. To move beyond.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I’m not sure we can escape our natures.
Believe me I’ve tried. I’m not even so sure anymore that we should want
to.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: I love that you said that. It makes me feel
a bit lighter. I’ve been rather heavy lately. Thinking about my
childhood. Realizing how much a product I am of my upbringing. I’ve been
seeing someone. A therapist.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: You are a therapist, right?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: No no. I’m a psychologist, but I do
research. I’m a behaviorist. I work with animals. Mice at the
moment.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I hope you don’t perform any of those dreadful
torture experiments, Nathan.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Heavens no. My work now is… Right now I’m
teaching mice… well, table manners, to be candid.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: How’s it going?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Quite well, really. It’s a lot of work. A
lot of reinforcement, mostly positive. Right now I’ve gotten two of my
subjects to use napkins. Tiny napkins of course.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Paper or cloth?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: I hope you don’t think me daft. It’s
important work. It’s part of a larger sociological experiment. I’m
federally funded.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: What’s the larger experiment?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: It’s my thesis that if table manners can be
taught to mice, they can be taught to humans.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Going out on a limb, aren’t you, Nathan?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: The truth is most people don’t have table
manners today. And when the foundations of civilized society crumble and
disappear, civilized society in its entirely follows closely at its
heels.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I’m not sure.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Courtesy, decorum, manners, are all sadly
lacking from our daily intercourse. Rudeness, vulgarity, meanness are
the norm.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: We are animals after all.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Ergo if I can teach table manners to mice, I
can teach them to humans. If I can teach table manners to humans, I can
save the world.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I really like him, Rose. He’s so… …passionate
about his work.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: My brother says he likes you, too.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Yeah. Says he likes you even more than he
likes his own mother. And according to my brother Nathan’s abormally
close with his mother.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: I began going to a therapist when I was in
my thirties, because I felt that I wasn’t enjoying life the way my
friends were. After a time my childhood came up.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Lord, we thank you for this bountiful gift
we are about to receive.</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: Amen.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: My God, no! My God! Oh, Nathan.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: That is the wrong fork, young man. Harold,
tell the boy.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: That is the wrong fork, young man.</p>
<p><strong>nathan as a boy</strong>: I’ll use the right one. I’m sorry.
I forgot.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Harold, tell the boy more.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Too late. Go to your room.</p>
<p><strong>nathan as a boy</strong>: But…</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Harold! Tell the boy again.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: No “buts.” Go to your room now.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: And think about what you’ve done.</p>
<p><strong>wendall</strong>: And do you think maybe this early childhood
indoctrination has something to do with your interest in table manners
in the present.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: I don’t think so. No.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Why do you ask?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: It looks wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: You look wonderful. I’m on top of the world
tonight, Lila. Work is going splendidly and my personal life is …</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Um-mmm. Oh Nathan, this salad is delish…</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: My God! The fork! The fork!</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I’m sorry?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Tell her, Harold… It’s just that… It’s
nothing. It’s just that the outside fork is the salad fork. One goes
from the outside in as the dinner progresses.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Oh, I’m sorry. I’m sorry, Nathan. I never
really learned those things.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: No biggie.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Boy, this is good!</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: I’m sorry that I became so upset.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: No, I’m sorry. I’m really backward in certain
areas.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: It’s only that I really enjoy your company
and…</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: You do?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Yes, and…</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: You really enjoy my company?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Yes. Please don’t talk with food in your
mouth, Lila. Please. You’re so pretty and it only mars your… I’m sorry.
I’m being critical.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: It’s just that I have some peculiarities,
and…</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I like you, too, Nathan.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: You do?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Yeah But I have some peculiarities also.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: I don’t care. I don’t care! Like what, for
example?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Like nothing.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: My brother says things are going really well
between you and Nathan.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I cannot believe how in love I am with this
man.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: He’s so cute. I even like his cute little
penis. It’s like a little pig’s penis or something. Rose, we connect on
every level. I’ve finally found someone I can feel completely safe
with.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Don’t throw that away. I had that once with a
guy. But I threw it away for a cheap thrill.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: One night stand?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: No. I married a midget.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Marrying a midget was a cheap thrill?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Well he wasn’t really a midget. He was on the
cusp of midgethood. That’s what made it cheap. Had he been an actual
midget, there would’ve been nothing cheap about it, my dear.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I didn’t know you were into that sort of
thing.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Let me tell you, honey, midgets are the best
kept secret in male companionship. They’re portable. They’re
controllable. They’re eager. And they’re exactly the right height for a
little covert oral fun on the dance floor.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I have a friend you might like to meet.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Oh?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Three foot one.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Be still my crotch.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Rose, Nathan’s no midget, but he’s asked me to
move in with him.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Yeah. My brother told me.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: And I think I’m going to.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Stand on a stepladder sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Lila moved in with me. Did I love her? I
thought so. But from my new vantage point I realize that love is nothing
more than a messy conglomeration of need, desperation, fear of death,
insecurity about penis size, and the self-involved, ego driven need to
collect other people’s hearts. Not that I judge it. Listen, I don’t want
to be dead yet. Is there any way to…</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: No I suppose not. No biggie. Anyway, Lila
moved in. We had our problems, but we both wanted love so badly, we
turned a blind eye.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: It’s lovely to finally meet you, Mr. and
Mrs. Bronfman. I’ve heard so much about you and I’ve seen you in
photographs from Nathan’s childhood, but it’s nice to meet you in the
flesh. I must say, you look exactly the same as in the photographs.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Thank you, dear.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Actually, Mother and Father, you look very,
very old. You look terrible.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Nathan!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Tell him, Harold.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Son, your mother and I are doing a
production of The Gin Game at the local community theater. We forgot to
take off our make-up.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Goodness, you two look exactly as you did in
those old photos.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Yes, so you mentioned earlier, dear.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Lila’s a nature writer, mother.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: I love nature. As long as it stays in the
zoo where it belongs.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Don’t you agree, dear?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Of course she does, mother.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: What are you doing in there?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I’ll be out in a minute.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: I’m sorry about my parents.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: You didn’t seem sorry when you were laughing
at all your mother’s stupid, tasteless, cruel animal jokes.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: I was simply attempting to keep the evening
light. You know that I feel similarly to you about nature.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Do you?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Of course. I simply love the… naturalness of
it all.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Do you? Oh do you, darling?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Why certainly!</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Oh, darling. I’m so relieved. Let’s celebrate
with a long hike in the woods tomorrow!</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: That’s a great idea.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: It’ll be wonderful! I’ll show you my old
stomping grounds!</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Terrific. Can’t wait!</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Shaving cream?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I don’t think so. Why?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Darling, did you bring the insect repellent
lotion?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Yes, darling.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Oh, and the sun block?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: What SPF, sweetie?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Fifteen.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Perfectomundo! We are ready! Say, wouldn’t
it be wonderful to have an insect repellent lotion that also worked as a
sun block? Think of all the time one would save.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Yes, darling.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: I think I’ll get Johannsen in chemistry on
that. Oh! Did you bring the first aid kit?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Flares?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: We could call it “Quit Bugging Me, Sunny.”
Get it? Sunny. S-u-n-n-y.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: That’s very funny.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: I love you so much.</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: Then, gentlemen, one day I saw something I
hadn’t seen since my father died in a freak accident involving a rotted
log and four thousand bees stinging his head… I saw other human beings.
They chattered away at each other in what appeared to be gibberish.
Later I learned it was English. Now I wonder if perhaps my initial
assessment hadn’t been correct.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: It was a flash of white. I ruled out deer
immediately. Too… upright.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Did you see that?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I don’t know. Something.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: A deer?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: No. Too… upright. Might’ve been a person.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: It might behoove us to turn back at this
point.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: If it’s a person, why should we go see it?
It’s not like it’s nature or anything. It’s just a person. Sometimes
people who live in the woods don’t want to be seen. They live in the
woods because they’re anti-social, Lila. We have to respect that.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: This is the way to get ticks, Lila. This is
it. Bingo! Lyme Disease! You’ve hit the nail on the head here.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Oh for God’s sa…</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: I had never seen anything like it.</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: It was an ape as I had never seen before. Like
me, yet different in certain essential details. And all at once I felt a
heat pass through me. My heart raced. Gentlemen, I wanted to touch her,
to caress her, to be one with her. I had urges and desires I could not
explain. I felt overwhelmed by the power this strange creature had over
me, and so I did what any animal would do when it comes across an animal
of superior strength…</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: He bolted.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: You don’t understand my language, do you?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I take it back, you do understand my
language.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Oh God.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Oh my God! Is he dead? Please put something
on.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: You’ll catch cold. It’s cold. What do you
suppose he is, a survivalist?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I think he’s feral.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Feral? Don’t touch him! He might be
diseased! He might… My God, rabies!</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: He looks perfectly fine.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: I think we should go. Please. Before he
wakes up and, I don’t know, eats us, or whatever feral things do.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I don’t understand you. This is fascinating
and you just want to run away. I mean, here we have a human being
totally uncontaminated by civilization, totally free, and all you want
to do is run back to your…</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Actually, I just had an amusing thought.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Feral, huh? Totally uncontaminated?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Look at him. He doesn’t understand English. He
moves like an animal.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: It’s perfect!</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Nathan, what the hell are you talking
about?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Forget mice! Actually forget guinea pigs,
cats, monkeys, and chimps also. I’m on to stage five: The human
subject.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Oh no. You can’t take him from his home,
Nathan.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Don’t you see? He’s my Tabula Rasa, my Eliza
Dolittle. He’s my ticket to the top of the Behaviorist food chain. He’s
going to make me famous.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I won’t allow you. It’s wrong. He’s happy
here.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Is he, Lila? Is he happy living filthy and
naked alone in this tick infested wilderness? Never to know the love of
a good woman, never to revel in the pitter-patter of little feet, never
to read Moby Dick, or marvel at a Monet, or just sit back after a day of
hard but rewarding work, smoke a pipe, and wonder about the nature of
reality.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: You’d be taking away his freedom, Nathan.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Freedom’s just another word for nothing left
to lose, Lila, to quote Janet Jackson.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Belonging to something, a person or a
society, is a basic human craving. We are communal creatures. This poor
soul has no one, nothing…</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Oh God, I have no one. Nothing. You give me
this beautiful gift, this glorious sunset. But with no one to say “isn’t
that a beautiful sunset” to, it becomes meaningless, just another stupid
sunset. They happen everyday. So what?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: …what is it that makes us human, if not the
knowledge that we are indeed human? Think of this poor soul’s education
as the greatest gift we could bestow upon…</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Great. Grab his feet. We’ll throw him in the
trunk.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Doctor…</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Only three shocks. A chimp takes fifteen.
This is going to be tres simple, no, Gabrielle?</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Oui, doctor, oui.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Good morning… We need a name for him, don’t
we?</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Oui.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: You decide. Today is your day.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Really? My day? Well, I had a sweet
little mongrel puppie named Puff when I was a girl. This one reminds me
of my dog, all shaggy! So cute! I loved my doggie very much,
monsieur.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Puff it is then. Puff Bronfman. Is that
okay?</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Oui. Perfect!</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Good morning, Puff Bronfman. I’m
Dr. Bronfman and this is my assistant Gabrielle. We’re your mommy and
daddy while you are here.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: How about some salad, son?</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Dr. Bronfman! Dr. Bronfman!</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Oh, Hi, Gabrielle.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Hi. I just wanted to tell you that I very
much enjoy working with you. Now I’m embarrassed that I say this.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: No. Don’t be. I really enjoy hearing that.
You’re a terrific assistant.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Merci. I… Do you… would you like to go
get a cup of coffee, perhaps?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Well, I don’t know. I’m actually on my way
to…</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Now I am truly embarrassed. Forgive me. I
should not have asked such a stupid question. I know you are a very
important man and…</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: No. Don’t be silly. It’s just…</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: I am a foolish little thing. I am pink in
my face, no? It is only that I have been so lonely lately and… I am
ashamed. I’ll see you tomorrow, okay? Unless… Am I fired now?</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Thank you so much for accompanying
me.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Not at all.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: I have had such a difficult time in my
personal life and you seem to be such a nice man… but I’m talking too
much again, no?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Of course not.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: You’re so sweet. Oh, why are there not
more men out there like you?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: There there.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: You know just the right thing to say.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Listen, you’re the best assistant I’ve ever
had… Gabrielle.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: I like it when you say my name. Is that
stupid?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: What are you doing in there?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Nothing. Be right out.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Hello? Oh, hi… Gabrielle!</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Uh-huh. Right, Gabrielle. Right.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Absolutely, Gabrielle. Someone from work!
Sorry about that, Gabrielle. Uh-huh. Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Who from work?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Excuse me one second, would you,
Gabrielle?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Who is it, Nathan?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Look, Lila, when I’m on a work…</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Nathan, I…</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: It’s hormonal, Nathan. I can’t help it. I’m
sorry.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Your entire body?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I’m getting electrolysis. It’s working, but it
takes time. So meanwhile I have to…</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: You have to shave? Like an ape?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Apes don’t shave, you son of a bitch!</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Don’t quibble. You know what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I’m sorry. Please don’t be mad at me for
this.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Mad? I’m I’m… disgusted!</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I’m the same person I was before you knew,
damn it! Oh God!</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: I have to think! I have to think!</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Oh God, why… do… I… have… to… be… like… Oh,
no! Oh, shit! Hello? Hello? Is anyone there? Who’s there?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: I don’t get it. I don’t get it. I don’t get
it. How could I find myself in this mess? This is a mess. This is not a
situation I understand. This is a mess. How do I extricate myself from
this mess? Is my girlfriend a man? I don’t understand. This is not part
of any plan. She deceived me. She has hair. But am I being fair? So what
if she has hair? Who am I to judge? I have hair. But I’m supposed to
have hair. I am a man. Men are supposed to have hair. But poor Lila.
Think of what she’s had to go through. The courage she’s had to have in
the face of this abomination of nature. I should love her all the more.
I should love every hair on her body. I mean, she doesn’t mind that I
have a mortifyingly small…</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Oh, Doctor. I did not know. I’m sorry to
disturb you. I just came for some papers I left.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Gabrielle. No, I’m sorry if I startled you.
I came to think. God, Did I hang up on you?</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Oui. Perhaps I called at a bad time. I am
sorry.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: No. I just got distracted. I’m so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Is everything fine?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Oui. Now you’ve got me talking French.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: I was in my p.j.’s when I remembered I
left some papers I need to go over. See? I rushed right out of the
house. I must look a mess. I’m so embarrassed.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: I’m in my p.j.’s, too. Funny, huh?</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Coincidence, yes? And how is our son?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Our…? Oh! He seems fine. I guess we woke
him. The lights and all.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: I should turn them off. Maybe I sing him
a lullaby my mama sang to me when I was a little girl.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: When you were a little French girl?</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Oui.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: That would be good.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: There.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Shall we close up, then?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Maybe we should just sit for a while. It’s
very peaceful.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: It’s nice, yes. I’m glad I ran into you,
both in our silly pajamas. It is two happy coincidences, no?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Yes. Happy happy.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Yet you look so sad. A great man like you
should not be sad.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: I’m fine. Life is funny, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: I am sleepy.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: I shouldn’t say this, but you’re pretty,
Gabrielle. It’s unprofessional, I know.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Really? I always think myself so ugly.
No, not ugly, but plain. A wallflower.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Really? No. Not at all. You’re a very pretty
girl. You should know that. You should be confident.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Thank you so much. Merci. It’s very
wonderful to hear a man say such a nice compliment.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: It’s true. I wouldn’t lie.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: You are sweet.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: So soft. So smooth. I’m sorry. It’s
just…</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Shh.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Was that okay? I mean, was I able to…
satisfy you?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: You are an animal.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Really? Wow! That’s that’s terrific to hear
from someone so… feminine, so female.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I love being female because it, how do you
say, allows me to be close to men.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: I’m glad you’re female. Do you think our boy
witnessed the primal scene?</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Anyway it’s time he grew up. N’est- ce
pa? I love chest hair on a man. I know it isn’t fashionable now, hairy
men. But to me it is the very sign of masculinity.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: What is wrong, my darling?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Nothing, my darling. All is right with the
world.</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: I saw it, gentlemen. I saw the whole sweaty,
passionate, ugly, beautiful act, and to use the vernacular, I wanted me
some of that.</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: And I think I understood from that moment,
that in order to get some, I would have to do what they said. In order
to experience this primal, basic, animal thing, I would first have to
become a civilized, prissy, uptight human. I would have to become
Nathan.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Excellent, Puff. Now, the lady you’re with
excuses herself to go powder her nose.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Perfect. Perfect, Puff!</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Dr. Bronfman’s line. Yes. One moment
please. Lila.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Shit. Hi, honey.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: So, how’s it going today?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Good. Making progress.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Honey, can we talk tonight? You know, about
stuff? Things have been so strained for the past three weeks, since you
know, and I just want to talk.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Everything’s fine, honey. We don’t need to
talk. Besides I have to work late.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Please, Nathan. I really need this. You’ve
been working late a lot.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Okay, we’ll have dinner tonight.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Yeah. Okay. Be home around seven. Bye. What?
I’m sorry. What was I supposed to do?</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: I don’t know, Nathan. What are you
supposed to do?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: You don’t abandon somebody because they have
a physical problem.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Funny. I thought that’s exactly what you
did. You just don’t have the courage to admit it to yourself.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Funny. I still feel guilt. Even dead. One
would’ve hoped… But alas. You know, I really did love Lila. But with
her… problem… and then when Gabrielle revealed her feelings. And
Gabrielle was so… conventionally female. And she had an accent. I was
lost from that moment on. But Gabrielle was right. I couldn’t admit it
to myself, this shallowness of character, let alone to Lila.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Are you seeing somebody else, Nathan? I just
have to know.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Of course not.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: It would just be helpful to know.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Because, you know, you seem so distant. And
you work late every night. And we hardly ever have sex, and when we do,
it’s… I don’t know. It feels different.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: I’m just preoccupied.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Do you like my new look?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Yeah. It’s nice. It’s really good.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I’m trying, you know. I’m trying to be what
you want. I want to be what you want, Nathan. All I want is to be what
you want.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Shh. It’s okay. It’s okay, Lila. You’re what
I want. You know that. You’re exactly what I want.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Sure. Of course.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Because I’m really trying, you know. Rosie
says maybe only another two years of the elctrolysis.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: That’s great.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I’ve signed up for a ballet class. And look at
my nails! A real girl!</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: That’s great. It’s a great color for
you.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Oh, Nathan, let’s have a baby!</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: So anyway, that’s the nightmare I’ve been
having lately.</p>
<p><strong>wendall</strong>: Do you suppose it has anything to do with
Lila’s unusually hairy body?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: No, why?</p>
<p><strong>wendall</strong>: Well, it seems that since Lila broached the
subject of children, you’ve been on edge and I know you have an issue
with the, uh, body hair.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Oh, I see. Yes, that’s something to think
about. That’s very good. That’s what you get the big bucks, right? Ha
ha.</p>
<p><strong>wendall</strong>: I just think it might be important to
explore your feelings for Lila.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: I love Lila. I mean, she’s a wonderful
person. And… she loves me! That’s no small potatoes. I mean she really
loves me. She’s sacrificed so much to be in this relationship with me.
And she’s a good person. A truly good person. How rare is that in this
world, eh? And how could I stop loving somebody because of a little
physical imperfection, if it can even be called that. I mean, God knows
I’m not perfect! What about my eyesight? It’s lousy, that’s what! Lila’s
not going to leave me because of my eyesight. What about my penis?</p>
<p><strong>wendall</strong>: And how do you feel about Gabrielle?</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: Good-eve-n-ing-lay-dees-and-gent- elmen.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Bravo, Puff! Bravo!</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Isn’t Puff doing spectacularly, honey?</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Hmmmph.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Gabby, what is it?</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Hmmph. Hmmph. Nathan, we have to talk,
you and I.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Not in front of the boy.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Very well.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: My little French.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Stop. Get away.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: You have to choose Nathan. It’s like
Sophie’s choice. Only it is Nathan’s choice. Did you ever see that
movie, Sophie’s Choice? It is like that. Only it is this.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Gabby, you know I’m trying to sort things
out.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: No! It is now that you must decide. I
love you, Doctor Nathan… …but I will not wait. I will not be your
chippy. I will not be your little Mademoiselle Parlez-vous side dish. My
love. I want to have a sweet tiny baby inside my belly… from you.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: I love you so much, Gabrielle.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: But?… But? There is a “but,” Nathan.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: But I don’t know how to leave Lila.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Now there’s a butt, Nathan.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Oh! I didn’t see you there, sneaky boy! You’re
like a boy sneaking in…</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: …the back door of a movie theater. Yes,
indeed.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: You remember that from my book? I’m touched!
What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Nothing. Hard day. Gonna have a drink.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I’ll make it. I’m so happy, Nathan!
Everything’s going to be so great! Scotch on the rocks, right? Just
kidding. I know what you drink, mister. I know what you drink.
Voila!</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: How’s work?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Cruddy, okay? Are you satisfied?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: No. I don’t want your work to be cruddy.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: My assistant quit today. Okay? He was highly
valuable to the project.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Oh, baby. I’m sorry. Can’t you hire somebody
else?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: I guess.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Hey! I could come work for you! I know I
haven’t been all that supportive of this project, but I’ve come
around.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Have you?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Oh yes, baby! I think that this is a wonderful
project you’re doing, taking this poor unfortunate, uncivilized creature
and turning him into a human being! What a wonderful wonderful
compassionate man you are!</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Yes! And I want to help. You won’t have to pay
me, and I was thinking of giving up that crazy nature writing
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: How come?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Who needs it? I have you and I have being a
woman and I have thinking about womanly things! I love being a woman
because…</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Such as what womanly things?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Such as my man and how to please him! Such as
making wonderful dinners for my man! Such as looking pretty for my man!
And I’m writing an article on quilting for the Ladies Home Journal!</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I had sold my fucking soul.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: I let her sell her soul. I stood by as she
did it. It’s inexcusable. At the time though I thought it might
help.</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: When she came to work with Nathan, she seemed
different, gentlemen, I don’t know, somehow soulless.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Bravo to you, Puff!</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: That was wonderful!</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: You were wonderful today, darling. Such
authority with the ape-man boy. It made me so hot for you.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Unnhh.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: The way you are taming him, it sends
chills down my girlish spine and… everywhere else, too.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Urgh.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Take me, darling! Tame your little monkey
of love!</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Well, I’m tamed, Dr. Bronfman.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: I’m glad… my assistant.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: I think he’s ready.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Oh boy!</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: Oh boy!</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Now, Puff, we’re leaving on the electronic
collar. I don’t think we’ll need to shock you, but just in case.</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: Okay. That’s fair.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: No, Puff! Bad!</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: My apologies, madam.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: It’s okay, Puff.</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: Shan’t happen again.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: This is great, Puff. You’re doing fine.</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: I’m loving this. It’s such a treat to be out
and about. What a wonderful invention a city is. The immense buildings
of glass and steel glinting in the afternoon sun, the smartly dressed
women in their best summer frocks, the colorful street vendors.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: How is everything?</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: Just spectacular. Great salmon. Fantastico!
You’ve got to give me the recipe! My compliments to the chef!</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: I’m glad you…</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Puff, no!</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: And will that be all today?</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: It shan’t happen again. I swear it. I’m just
getting my sea legs, you know.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: It’s an animal urge, Puff. It’s nothing to be
ashamed of.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Lila! Tell him.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: You just have to control it. We’re not
apes.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Thank you very much for that.</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: I don’t think this aversion therapy is really
necessary, doctor. I understand the problem.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Humor me, Puff. It’s essential that I am
able to trust you to function independently in the world.</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: I bow to your expertise in these matters.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Lila?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Good. You’re doing fine.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Excellent.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: You’re doing very nicely, Puff. I’m
pleased.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Great…</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: Eh.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Excellent work, Puff. Extra desert
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: Yahoo!</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Tomorrow, the acid test.</p>
<p><strong>chester’s waitress</strong>: How you all doin’ today?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Very well.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Very well.</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: Very well.</p>
<p><strong>chester’s waitress</strong>: Good enough! What can I get for
you?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Puff, why don’t you order first?</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: Uh, what’s a Reuben, please?</p>
<p><strong>chester’s waitress</strong>: The what, honey? Oh, the Reuben?
That’s a sandwich with corned beef and sauer…</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: That’s fine. That’s what I’ll have. Corned
beef is a good food.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Puff, I’m proud of you! You did remarkably
well under difficult circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Absolutely!</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: Did I? I tried so hard! I really concentrated!
Oh, I’m so happy!</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: And because you did so well, we have a
little surprise for you.</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: Extra dessert?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Even better.</p>
<p><strong>nathan and lila</strong>: Surprise!</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Free to come and go as you please. There’s
some “mad money” in the night table drawer.</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: It’s wonderful! Do you think I’m ready? Do you
really?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: I trust that you’ll make good, mature
decisions. I trust that you’ll do the proper thing.</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: Oh, I will! Your very trust has instilled an
enormous sense of responsibility in me. I don’t want to disappoint
you.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Good. Remember, when in doubt: Don’t ever do
what you really want to do.</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: Got it.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: I’m going to go down and check on Puff. See
how he’s holding up.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Should I come with?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Nah. You just relax. How’s the book?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Ummm. It’s good.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: I won’t be long.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: You’re kidding! Holy shit. Yeah, no duh!
I had a wild hair up my ass over that for a month.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Yeah? What?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Hi. It’s Nathan.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Call you back. You bastard! What do you
want?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: I just want to talk.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: We have nothing to say! You are a rotten
bastard, that’s what!</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Please. Just one minute of your time.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Why? You’ve made your decision, Mister
Stinky American! Now I hate you! No, I don’t hate you; I don’t even
think about you!</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: I’ve got some things to tell you.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Well, I think it would be easier if I could
talk to you in person.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Well, I think…</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: You think too much. I need a man who
doesn’t think so much but acts more than he thinks… is what I need!</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: You heard me! You make me sick when you
pretend to not understand what I am saying to you! Go away from
here!</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Well, look, I’m sorry to have bothered
you.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: All right, already! Come in if you must!
The door’s open, you son of a bitch!</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: In here, you lousy piece of merde.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: God, you’re beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Please. I look a mess.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: No. You look so beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Anyway. Come already to the point.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: I’m… I’m going to leave Lila. I can’t stop
thinking about you.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: I’ve moved on.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: I’ve been seeing Johannsen in
chemistry.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: That goddamn Neanderthal? I’m the one who
gave him the idea for the combination bug spray-sun screen! Did you know
that?!</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: That’s not how he tells it.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Of course not, that Swedish thief! He’s a
thief of hearts! I love you, Gabrielle.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Hunh.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Just give me some time to let Lila down
easily. She’s a really nice girl and I don’t want to hurt her more than
is necessary.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: You hurt me, you know, when you made
Nathan’s Choice. Does that not even matter to you, you pig?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Can you ever forgive me?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: You were gone a long time.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Yeah. Puff and I got into a big,
philosophical discussion. He’s really quite well read, considering he’s
only been literate for a month now. He’s going to make us famous,
Lila.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: So he’s doing okay?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying his new
digs.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: That’s funny because, you know, I just went
and picked him up at some flophouse on the lower eastside. He called
here when he ran out of his “mad” money after spending an entire evening
drinking, watching strippers, and fucking a whore! Oh, and what did you
do tonight, honey?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: And what did you do tonight, honey?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: I’ve fallen in love with somebody else,
Lila.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: And what did you do tonight, honey?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: I fucked her! Okay? I fucked her. I’m sorry.
But that’s what the hell I did.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Do you know what I gave up to be with you?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I gave up my soul, my beliefs. I gave up my
body hair!</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Yeah, well, I’m sorry. The human heart is a
strange thing.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: How the hell would you know anything about the
human heart?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Lila…</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: How’s that for ladylike, Nathan.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: For two weeks I holed myself up in a motel
room. I didn’t even know who I was. My world had crumbled. There is
nothing that makes you feel dirtier than finally deciding to sell your
soul and finding no buyers.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: No maid service! For God’s sake, can’t you
read the fucking “do not disturb” sign on the fucking doorknob?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Lila, it’s Rosie.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Go the fuck away, Rosie.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Please, honey, let me in.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Rose, please go away.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Lila, I want to help you.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: How’d you know where I was?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Nathan told my brother.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Your brother should have his license
revoked.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Yeah, although I’m not going to turn him in. I
like hearing the dirt.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Why didn’t your brother tell you that Nathan
was having an affair?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I don’t know, honey. I don’t know. Maybe he
just didn’t want to get involved.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Oh, Rosie.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Let’s get you out of here. Come stay with me
until you get your strength back. Free electrolysis, if you want it!
We’ll get that face of yours cleared up in no time.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Yeah. I gotta get myself together. I want to
look good. If I’m gonna fuck with Nathan, and I am, I want him to want
to fuck me when I do it.</p>
<p><strong>bearded psychologist</strong>: …and so without further ado, I
give you Dr. Nathan Bronfman and Puff.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Thank you. Let’s get right to it. Here we
have Puff the day of his capture.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: And here he is today, a scant three months
later.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Puff, why don’t you say a few words to the
assemblage.</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: It would be my pleasure, doctor. Distinguished
gentlemen and ladies of the psychological community, I stand before you
today, a living testament to the amazing skill of Dr. Nathan Bronfman.
To say that he took me from crayons to perfume would be a vast
understatement. Dr. Bronfman took me from playing with my own feces,
then to crayons, and then to an appreciation of the complex works of
Franz Kline, Joseph Beuys, and Marcel Duchamp. From compulsive
masturbation to…</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: And, so, goodnight, adieu, until we meet
again, au revoir.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: You were wonderful!</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Was I? I wasn’t a tad stiff?</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Don’t be silly! And you were wonderful,
too! I loved the way you said ” au revoir.”</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Come on, you two. Let’s go celebrate!</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Now the tango.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: I think it went swimmingly today. You two
make an excellent team.</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: To be taken from the depths of ignorance and
depravity and raised to heights of culture and refinement! This is the
priceless gift bestowed upon me by Dr. Nathan Bronfman.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Done!</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Ready!</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: So we’ve got seventeen new bookings for
speaking engagements, my wonderful men.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Terrific. We’re all going to be rich and
famous.</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: Thanks to you, Nate.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Thanks to you, Buddy. And your diligence and
intelligence and perseverance.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: And of course to you, my sweet, for your…
moral support.</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: here, here.</p>
<p><strong>midget</strong>: Excuse me, are you Dr. Bronfman?</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: Is that a little boy?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: No, Puff. This man is a midget. In
actuality, they prefer to be called “Little People.” Isn’t that correct,
my good man?</p>
<p><strong>midget</strong>: Yes sir. Little People.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: This Little Person is actually a fully grown
adult man, Puff, believe it or not, who, due to a genetic anomaly, is
miniature but perfectly proportioned. Turn, please.</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: Interesting.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Now, my diminutive friend, what can I do for
you?</p>
<p><strong>midget</strong>: You can get into that goddamn Lucite
bachelor pad for starters, Goliath.</p>
<p><strong>midget</strong>: Not you, Joyboy.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: What is this about? We have no money on
these premises. Please if you are from some little person terrorist
fringe group…</p>
<p><strong>midget</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Lila?</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: That’s Lila?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Shut up! Yeah, this is Lila, cunt. And don’t
let the hirsutism fool you. I know more about being a woman, and more
about the black hearts of men than you, in your pretty little powdered,
bullshit fantasy world, can ever imagine. I know the darkness and
cruelty of nature, sweetie pie.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Lila, you don’t intend to hurt us, do
you?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Eat shit, thumbtack dick! Thank you, Frank.
You’re the best.</p>
<p><strong>midget</strong>: Anything for you, Lila.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: See, Frank and I are kindred spirits. We both
know what it’s like to be shunned because of our appearance. We both
know how easily that turns into self-hatred.</p>
<p><strong>midget</strong>: Amen. Praise the Lord and pass the
ammunition!</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Sorry I’m late, parking is a bitch at this
place.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Uh, tie them up, Rosie. If you will.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: With pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I’m going to miss you.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Oh, Rosie.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: And I’m going to miss the lifestyle having you
as a client has afforded me.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Shut up, you.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I like you so much, with or without hair. But
don’t spread that around. Bad for business.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I’m really glad you two found each other.</p>
<p><strong>midget</strong>: We’re soul mates.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Souls have nothing to do with it, babe.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I’ll be in touch.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: No you won’t. But it’s okay. You have stuff
you gotta do.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Stay.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Out.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Bad.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Get up.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Take off your clothes.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: We’re going back to nature, you and I. I’m
going to retrain you. I’m going to make you free again if I have to kill
you doing it.</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: But I like being human now.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: You what?</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: I want to be the way I was before.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Good. I’ll show you how, apey.</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: Nice night.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Talking is to be kept to a minimum.
Eventually, when we are ready, there will be none. Language was invented
so that people could lie to each other and to themselves. There is no
other reason.</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: I agree?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: You lose. Any answer is the wrong answer.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: You’ll thank me eventually, Puff. Well, you
won’t thank me, because we won’t be speaking, but you’ll sort of thank
me with a special look, the look a dog gives you to let you know he
loves you.</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: What an enchanting picture you paint of our
future together.</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: And so commenced my reeducation, gentlemen.
Lila taught me so much. She was a stern but fair teacher. And over time,
I began to remember the carefree joy of living in a pure state of being.
But something else happened as well, something perhaps distinctly human…
I began to fall in love with Lila.</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: Boy, you look so good from this ang…</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: A penny for your thoughts, mon cheri.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: I don’t know. Something’s missing.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: So, Mother and Father, how’s Godspell
going?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: How did you know we…</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Tell him, Harold.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: It’s going famously, son, famously!</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: I’m glad.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Harold, ask Nathan what’s wrong.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Yes, please, somebody ask him what is
wrong.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: I want our boy back.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Oui.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: That bitch. I worked so hard. We worked so
hard, you and I. He would’ve made us famous.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: We still have you and I.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: I know. And that’s great. But it would be
great in a better way, not a better way but a different way, if I could
find him and bring him back.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Where do we look for little lost
Puff?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: I have some thoughts. I think that hairy
bitch is somewhere trying to turn him back into an ape.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: That is horrible. Apes are dirty. No?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: You better believe they’re dirty! And
smelly! And messy! And they don’t know their forks from their
assholes!</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: I’m going alone. This could be
dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: and turning away from him onto her</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: A little resistance would be nice, damn
it.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Please let me go with you.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Aha!</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: No luck yet, my sweet.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: It was paradise. At least for a tiny little
while.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Aha! Finally. I’ve covered almost the entire
seaboard and parts of eastern Ohio.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Ugnh.</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: Ugnh.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Oh please, is that as articulate as you can
be after all the time I spent teaching you? We’ve discussed
Wittgenstein, for Christ’s sake. Not that you ever had anything very
original or challenging to say on the subject.</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: Unn.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Down from the tree. Both of you. Keep your
hands where I can see them. Don’t want you pulling any weapons out of
your fur.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Look at you two. You both disgust me.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Oook. Oook.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Shut up! I gave you… life. I created you in
my image, Puff. I took you from this primordial ooze and brought you
into the world of culture and art and manners. And this is how you repay
me? By heading back to the ooze first chance you get? I should leave you
here with Lila the ape woman. It would serve you right, you ungrateful
piece of crap. But I’m not going to. You’re too valuable to me. Totally
selfish of me. You serve my purpose. But if you had any smarts you would
realize that I serve your purpose as well. Life is so much more
delightful when lived in a silk suit.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Ooka.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Don’t worry, Lila. You can stay. I don’t
have any interest in you anymore. C’mon, monkey boy.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Now!</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Puff, put the gun down.</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: Ounpoo. Ungh.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Let’s be reasonable human beings here. We’re
all reasonable human beings, aren’t we?</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: Unka unka unka unka unka.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Look, why don’t you and Lila stay here and
have your natural life. I’ll just go on my way. You’ll never see me
again.</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: I have to talk. Is that okay?</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: You did create me in your image, Nathan.
Before you I was a simple, happy, complete being, in harmony with the
world around me. After you I became duplicitous, cynical, angry, anal,
totally out of touch with my surroundings. In a word, Nathan, I became
you. Lila has reintroduced me to myself. And, incidentally, what I’m
about to do, kill you, is something that would never have occurred to me
to do as a creature of the Earth. Before when I killed, it was for food
or in self-defense. Now I will kill for revenge. Revenge is an abstract
concept, Nathan. And I learned abstract thinking from you.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Puff, don’t.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Then I shot Nathan.</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: Then Lila shot Nathan.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Then Puff shot me. Then I died. That’s all I
know. That’s the end of my story. Do I get to go to heaven now? Or is
it… hell? Or… what? I just stay here, is it? I just stay here and tell
it again? And after that? Again? And after… Yes. Yes, of course.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: I don’t even know what sorry means anymore.
It’s odd. When I was alive I knew – maybe it was all I knew…</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: He’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: We bury the body. We disappear into the woods.
Nobody knows.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: No. This is the end of the road. There’s a
dead human being here. For all of his faults, he was a human being, and
certainly a victim of his culture as much as anybody.</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: Forget him, Lila. We’ll disappear. We’ll never
talk about it again. We’ll never talk again period. I love you.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Puff, what happened to you is as much my fault
as Nathan’s. Maybe more so, because I knew it was wrong and I went along
with it anyway. I’m taking responsibility for the murder. I want you to
go back to your old life.</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: I won’t let you do that. I shot the bastard.
And I’m glad.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: No. Go back to the woods. This is a sacrifice
I need to make. In my world we have something called penance. It’s
another abstraction, but I had the concept drummed into my head during
my years in the convent. It doesn’t exist for you, and it shouldn’t.
See, I could never be free again anyway, so I might as well be in
jail.</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: Then I’ll live for both of us, Lila. I’ll be
the most free, truest animal in the whole forest. For both of us.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: That’s what I’m counting on.</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: But first I’ll live among them, just long
enough to testify before congress about the waywardness of
humankind.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Okay. If you think it will help.</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: And so, gentlemen, that is my story. I agreed
to testify before this committee because I hoped to convey to the
American public that there is indeed a paradise lost. Human beings have
become so enamored of their technologies and their intellectual prowess
and their fancy gourmet foods, that they’ve forgotten to look to the
Earth as a teacher. This is hubris, my friends. And my story of
destruction and betrayal is proof of that. I will keep my promise to
Lila. I will shed this suit and go back into the wilderness. I will live
out my days naked and free.</p>
<p><strong>congressman</strong>: Thank you, sir. Your story has touched
us all deeply. We will pass some legislation addressing this
problem.</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: Thank you. That is all I ask. Good-bye, Lila.
I take you with me in my untamed heart.</p>
<p><strong>older woman</strong>: Wait!</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>older woman</strong>: I saw you on C-Span. I’ve been looking
for you for thirty years. Then there you were, such a beautiful,
beautiful grown man.</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: Mother?</p>
<p><strong>older woman</strong>: Yes… Derek.</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: It’s a pleasure to meet you, mother. But I’m
an ape like dad was… And I have to go back into the woods now…
forever.</p>
<p><strong>older woman</strong>: Yes, I suppose so. I suppose I knew
that was going to be what you would say. It’s good to see you again
though.</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>older woman</strong>: I’m in the book, if you ever want to
drop me a line or something.</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: I’m an ape, mom. I’m an ape. And apes don’t
drop lines.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Hello, my little boy.</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: Hey, ma. Did you bring any clothes? I’m
freezing my ass off.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Oui. Nathan’s silk suit, just like you
asked.</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: Great. God, I’ve wanted you forever.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Say my name.</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: Gabrielle.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: You remind me so much of Nathan.</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: Like father, like son.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: You remind me so much of Nathan plus so
much of my little mongrel doggie.</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: Woof.</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: Arf.</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: As much as I loved Nathan, I’m not sorry she
killed him, if it means I can have you. Is that a terrible thing to say,
my sweet?</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Hush. No, it is never terrible to be in
love. Nathan’s memory lives on in our sacred union. I’m not sorry she
killed him either. Nathan was wonderful. He was erudite and
sophisticated and charming. You are all that, too. But you have
something more. You have a bit of the animal in you.</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: Let’s go eat, I’m starved.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: French?</p>
<p><strong>puff</strong>: Oui.</p>
