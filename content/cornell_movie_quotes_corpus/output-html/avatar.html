<h1 id="avatar">avatar</h1>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: When I was lying there in the VA hospital,
with a big hole blown through the middle of my life, I started having
these dreams of flying.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Sooner or later though, you always have to
wake up…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: They can fix a spinal, if you’ve got the
money. But not on vet benefits, not in this economy.</p>
<p><strong>perky newscaster</strong>: The Bengal tiger, extinct for over
a century, is making a comeback. These cloned tiger cubs at the Beijing
Zoo are…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I became a Marine for the hardship. To be
hammered on the anvil of life. I told myself I could pass any test a man
can pass.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Let’s get it straight up front. I don’t want
your pity. I know the world’s a cold-ass bitch.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You want a fair deal, you’re on the wrong
planet. The strong prey on the weak.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: It’s just the way things are. And nobody does
a damn thing.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: All I ever wanted in my sorry-ass life was a
single thing worth fighting for.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I hope you realize you’ve just lost a
customer!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Candy ass bitch.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: If it ain’t rainin’ we ain’t trainin’!</p>
<p><strong>agent 1</strong>: Are you Jake Sully?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Step off. You’re ruinin’ my good mood.</p>
<p><strong>agent 2</strong>: It’s about your brother.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: The strong prey on the weak. A guy with a
knife took all Tommy would ever be, for the paper in his wallet.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Jesus, Tommy.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: The Suits’ concern was touching.</p>
<p><strong>agent 1</strong>: Your brother represented a significant
investment. We’d like to talk to you about taking over his contract.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: The egghead and the jarhead. Tommy was the
scientist, not me. He was the one who wanted to get shot light years out
into space to find the answers.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Me – I was just another dumb grunt gettin’
sent someplace I was gonna regret.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Are we there?</p>
<p><strong>med tech</strong>: We’re there, Sunshine.</p>
<p><strong>med tech</strong>: People, you have been in cryo for five
years, nine months and twenty two days. You will be hungry, you will be
weak. If you feel nausea, please use the sacks provided for your
convenience. The staff thanks you in advance.</p>
<p><strong>crew chief</strong>: Exopacks on!</p>
<p><strong>crew chief</strong>: Remember people, you lose your mask
you’re unconscious in 20 seconds and you’re dead in four minutes. Let’s
nobody be dead today, it looks bad on my report.</p>
<p><strong>crew chief</strong>: Exopack on, let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>crew chief</strong>: Go directly into the base! Do not stop!
Go straight inside!</p>
<p><strong>wainfleet</strong>: Look at all that new meat.</p>
<p><strong>fike</strong>: Check it out, man. Meals on wheels.</p>
<p><strong>wainfleet</strong>: That is just wrong.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What’re you two limpdicks starin’ at?</p>
<p><strong>wainfleet</strong>: Seen a lotta guys leave this place in a
wheelchair. Never seen anybody show up in one.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: You are not in Kansas any more…</p>
<p><strong>quaritch</strong>: … You are on Pandora, ladies and
gentlemen. Respect that fact every second of every day.</p>
<p><strong>quaritch</strong>: Out beyond that fence every living thing
that crawls, flies or squats in the mud wants to kill you and eat your
eyes for jujubees.</p>
<p><strong>quaritch</strong>: We have an indigenous population of
humanoids here called the Na’vi. They’re fond of arrows dipped in a
neurotoxin which can stop your heart in one minute. We operate – we live
– at a constant threat condition yellow.</p>
<p><strong>quaritch</strong>: As head of security, it’s my job to keep
you alive. I will not succeed – – not with all of you. If you wish to
survive, you need a strong mental attitude, you need to follow
procedure…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Nothing like an old-school safety brief to put
your mind at ease.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Hey, you’re Jake right? Tom’s brother? You
look just like him. Sorry, I’m Norm Spellman, I went through avatar
training with him.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: He was a great guy – funny. It was a big shock
to all of us.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: And duh! – obviously you look like him. I
mean, if you weren’t genetically identical, you wouldn’t be taking over
his avatar.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: That’s why I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: So – you want to go check it out?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Me and Norm were out here to drive these
remotely controlled bodies called avatars. They’re grown from human DNA
mixed with DNA from the natives here.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Damn. They got big.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Yeah, they mature on the trip out. So the
proprioceptive sims worked pretty well.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yeah, they’ve got great muscle tone. Give us a
few hours, you guys can take them for a spin.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: It looks like him.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: No, it looks like you. This is your avatar
now, Jake.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: The idea is – every driver is matched to his
own avatar –</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: – so their nervous systems are in tune. Or
something. Which is why they offered me this gig, because I can link
with Tommy’s avatar, which was insanely expensive. Is this right? I just
say whatever in these videologs?</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Yeah. You just need to get in the habit of
documenting everything – what you see, what you feel – it’s all part of
the science. Good science starts with good observation.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Right. So, whatever. Here I am. Doing science.
Never been in a lab before.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Log off. It’s time to meet your boss for the
next five years.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Grace Augustine is a legend. She’s the head of
the Avatar Program, and she wrote the book – I mean literally wrote the
book – on Pandoran botany.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: That’s because she likes plants better than
people.</p>
<p>****: Who’s got my goddamn cigarette?!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: And here she is, Cinderella back from the ball.
Grace, I’d like you to meet Norm Spellman and Ja –</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Norm. I hear good things about you. How’s
your Na’vi?</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: May the All Mother smile upon our first
meeting.</p>
<p>****: Not bad. You sound a little formal.</p>
<p>****: There is still much to learn.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Uh, Grace, this is Jake S—-</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Yeah, yeah, I know who you are, and I don’t
need you. I need your brother. You know – the PhD who trained three
years for this mission.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: He’s dead. I know it’s a big inconvenience to
everyone.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: How much lab training have you had? Ever run
a gas chromatograph?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Any actual lab work at all?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: High school chemistry. But I ditched.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You see? You see? They’re pissing on us
without even the courtesy of calling it rain. I’m going to
Selfridge.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Grace, that’s not a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Here, tomorrow, oh eight hundred. Try to use
big words.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Parker, I used to think it was benign
neglect, but now I see you’re intentionally screwing us.</p>
<p><strong>selfridge</strong>: Grace. You know I enjoy our little
talks.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I need a research assistant, not some jarhead
dropout.</p>
<p><strong>selfridge</strong>: Actually, we got lucky with him.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Lucky? How is this in any way lucky?</p>
<p><strong>selfridge</strong>: Well – lucky your guy had a twin brother,
and lucky the brother wasn’t an oral hygienist or something. A Marine we
can use. I’m assigning him to your team as security escort.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: The last thing I need is another trigger
happy asshole out there!</p>
<p><strong>selfridge</strong>: Look, you’re supposed to be winning the
hearts and minds of the natives. Isn’t that the whole point of your
little puppet show? If you look like them, if you talk like them,
they’ll trust you?</p>
<p><strong>selfridge</strong>: But after – how many years? – relations
with the indigenous are only getting worse.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: That tends to happen when you use machine
guns on them.</p>
<p><strong>selfridge</strong>: This is why we’re here. Unobtanium.
Because this little gray rock sells for twenty million a kilo. No other
reason. This is what pays for the party. And it’s what pays for your
science. Comprendo?</p>
<p><strong>selfridge</strong>: Those savages are threatening our whole
operation. We’re on the brink of war and you’re supposed to be finding a
diplomatic solution. So use what you’ve got and get me some results.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: How much link time have you logged?</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Five hundred and twenty hours.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Like – an hour.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Tell me you’re joking.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Don’t! I got this.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: So you just figured you’d come out here to
the most hostile environment known to man, with no training of any kind,
and see how it went? What was going through your head?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Maybe I was just tired of doctors telling me
what I couldn’t do.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Relax and let your mind go blank. That
shouldn’t be hard for you.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Kiss the darkest part of my lily white –</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Initiate link.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: That’s a gorgeous brain. Nice activity.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Go figure. Alright, I’m going in.</p>
<p><strong>tech</strong>: Phase-lock at forty percent. He’s in
transition.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: That’s it. Find your way home.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: He’s in.</p>
<p><strong>tech</strong>: Phase-lock ninety nine percent. The link is
stable.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Take it slow, Jake. We need to check your motor
control. Try touching your fingertips together –</p>
<p><strong>med tech</strong>: Easy, Jake, I need you to sit down –</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Jake! Wait, we have to run some tests –</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Hey Marine!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Grace?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Well who’d you expect, numbnuts? Think
fast!</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Motor control is looking good.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Hey, check it out.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: I am a living god.</p>
<p><strong>quaritch</strong>: For you pogues, this is a banshee. A small
one. See, they like it when I bring fresh meat out here. And this
clearcutting really stirs up the hornet’s nest. So keep your head on a
swivel. If it moves, shoot it. If you’re not sure it’s moving – shoot
it! If it looks like a bunch of flowers you want to take home to Sally
Rottencrotch – SHOOT IT! What’re you gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>troopers</strong>: Shoot it, sir!</p>
<p><strong>quaritch</strong>: Outstanding. Let’s roll.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: That’s kinda freaky.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Lights out amigos. See ya’ at dinner.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Damn. Same old sack a’ bones.</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: Sully – Colonel wants to see you in the Armor
Bay.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You guys’re packing some heavy ordinance.</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: Yeah, `cause we’re not the only thing flyin’
around out there. Or the biggest. I’m gonna need you on a door gun, I’m
a man short.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Yeah, no problem.</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: See ya on the flight-line, zero nine. He’s
down there.</p>
<p><strong>quaritch</strong>: This low gravity makes you soft. You get
soft, Pandora will shit you out dead with zero warning.</p>
<p><strong>quaritch</strong>: I pulled your record, Corporal. Venezuela
– that was some mean bush. Nothing like this here, though. You got heart
kid, coming out here.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I figured – just another hellhole.</p>
<p><strong>mechanic</strong>: That servo’s in, Colonel, if you want to
try it.</p>
<p><strong>quaritch</strong>: I was in First Recon a few years ahead of
you. More than a few. Two tours in Nigeria, not a scratch. I come out
here and –</p>
<p><strong>quaritch</strong>: They could fix this if I rotated back. But
you know what? I kinda like it. Reminds me every day what’s out there.
Besides, I can’t leave –</p>
<p><strong>quaritch</strong>: This is my war, here.</p>
<p><strong>quaritch</strong>: The avatar program is a joke – buncha
limpdick scientists. But we have a unique opportunity here, you and I. A
recon Marine in an avatar body could get me the intel I need, on the
ground, right in the hostiles’ camp.</p>
<p><strong>quaritch</strong>: Looks good. I need you to learn about
these savages, gain their trust. Find out how I can force their
cooperation, or hit `em hard if they don’t. Maybe you can keep some of
my boys from going home like you. Or bagged-and-tagged.</p>
<p>****: That sounds real good, Colonel. So – am I still with
Augustine?</p>
<p><strong>quaritch</strong>: On paper. You walk like one of her science
pukes, you quack like one, but you report to me. Can you do that for
me?</p>
<p><strong>quaritch</strong>: Look, son – I take care of my own. Get me
what I need, I’ll see you get your legs back when you rotate home. Your
real legs.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Start calibrating. We’re on the flight line
in ten minutes.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: What did Atilla want?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Just Marines comparin’ tattoos.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Yeah. Well, listen to me, Marine –</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: – you’re driving an avatar, now. That means
you’re in my world, got it?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Got it.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: That son of a bitch has screwed up this
program enough. All this – – exists so we can go out there and build a
bridge of trust to these people, who could teach us so much. But thanks
to Quaritch and his thugs the Na’vi won’t even talk to us anymore.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Then how’s this supposed to work?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: We have a new face. You’re fluent, you’ve
studied the culture. You’re non-threatening. The ones we know best – the
Omaticaya clan – may give you a chance. Maybe you can get them back to
the table before things go tits-up for good.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: This is failing as a pep talk.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: How do we contact them?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: We don’t. They contact us. If they see us
taking our samples, treating the forest with respect – Not trampling
everything in sight – they may reach out to us.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Or they may skin us and make a drum.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Just keep your mouth shut and let Norm do the
talking.</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: Sturmbeest herd, one o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Looks like a bull, six cows and some
juveniles.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: The bull has the red on the dorsal armor?</p>
<p><strong>wainfleet</strong>: Yo Chacon! Get some!</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Stay with the ship. One idiot with a gun’s
enough.</p>
<p><strong>wainfleet</strong>: Whatever you say, Doc.</p>
<p>****: Ya’ll have fun out there.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Relax, Marine. You’re making me nervous.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: How will they know we’re here?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I’m sure they’re watching us right now.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: The kids were so bright, so eager to learn…
they picked up English faster than I could teach it to them.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Bring the soil probe – right there, yellow
case.</p>
<p>****: The stingbats knock them off. I guess I always hope somebody
will come back and read them.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Why don’t they come back?</p>
<p>****: The Na’vi learned as much about us as they needed to know.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What happened here?</p>
<p>****: Are you going to help with this gear? We’ve got a lot to
do.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: See, right here where the roots of the two
trees interact.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Don’t shoot. You’ll piss it off.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: It’s already pissed off!</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Jake, that armor’s too thick. Trust me.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: It’s a territorial threat display. Do not
run, or he’ll charge.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What do I do?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Hold your ground!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Oh yeah! Who’s bad?! That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: That’s what I’m talkin’ about, bitch!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: That’s right motherf–</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What about this one? Run, don’t run? What?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Run. Definitely RUN!</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: I’m going to have to call it, guys. We’re not
allowed to run night ops. Colonel’s orders.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: Sorry, Doc. He’s just gonna have to hang on
`till morning.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: He’s not going to make it till morning.</p>
<p>****: I don’t have all goddamn night! Come on! Come on!</p>
<p><strong>neytiri</strong>: Rrreeyaaah! Hyaaaah!!</p>
<p><strong>neytiri</strong>: Raaaarrrr!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Wait, don’t –</p>
<p><strong>neytiri</strong>: Forgive me, my brother.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Look, um, I know you probably don’t understand
this. But – thanks. Thank you. I owe you.</p>
<p><strong>neytiri</strong>: Forgive me. May your spirit run with the
Great Mother.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I would have been screwed if you hadn’t come
along –</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Hey, wait. Wait! Where you goin’?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Slow down a second will you. I just want to
thank you for killing those –</p>
<p><strong>neytiri</strong>: Don’t thank! You don’t thank for this! This
is sad. Very sad, only.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Okay, I’m sorry. Whatever I did – I’m
sorry.</p>
<p><strong>neytiri</strong>: All this is your fault! They did not need
to die.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: They attacked me. How’m I the bad guy</p>
<p><strong>neytiri</strong>: Your fault! You are like a baby, making
noise, don’t know what to do. You should not come here, all of you! You
only come and make problems. Only.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Okay, fine, you love your little forest
friends. So why not just let them kill my ass? What’s the thinking?</p>
<p><strong>neytiri</strong>: Why save you?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Yes, why save me?</p>
<p><strong>neytiri</strong>: You have a strong heart. No fear.</p>
<p><strong>neytiri</strong>: But stupid! Ignorant like a child!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: If I’m so ignorant, maybe you should teach
me.</p>
<p><strong>neytiri</strong>: Sky people can not learn. You do not
See.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Whooaa.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Then teach me to “see.”</p>
<p><strong>neytiri</strong>: No one can teach you to See.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Hey, slow down. Look, I think we just got off
on the wrong foot and –</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: –you just have to get to know me. I’m Jake.
Jake Sull–</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Whooaaa – shit!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I need your help.</p>
<p><strong>neytiri</strong>: You should not be here.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: So take me with you.</p>
<p><strong>neytiri</strong>: No. You go back.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What are they?</p>
<p><strong>neytiri</strong>: Atokirina’. Seeds of the Great Tree – very
pure spirits.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What was that all about?</p>
<p><strong>neytiri</strong>: Come!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p>****: Tsu’tey, what are you doing?! He is my captive!</p>
<p>****: These demons are forbidden here. I will kill this one as a
lesson to the others!</p>
<p>****: Stop! There has been a sign. This is a matter for the
Tsahik.</p>
<p>****: Bring him.</p>
<p>****: Why do you bring this creature here?</p>
<p>****: I was going to kill him, but there was a sign from Eywa.</p>
<p>****: I have said no dreamwalker will come here, to offend our home!
His alien smell fills my nose</p>
<p>****: Father, many atokirina came to this alien.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>neytiri</strong>: My father is deciding whether to kill
you.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Your father!? Uh, good to meet you, sir.</p>
<p>****: Step back!</p>
<p>****: I will look at this alien.</p>
<p><strong>neytiri</strong>: That is Mother. She is Tsahik – the one who
interprets the will of Eywa.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Who’s Eywa?</p>
<p><strong>mo’at</strong>: What are you called?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Jake Sully.</p>
<p><strong>mo’at</strong>: Why did you come to us?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I came to learn.</p>
<p><strong>mo’at</strong>: We have tried to teach other Sky People. It
is hard to fill a cup which is already full.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: My cup is empty, trust me. Just ask Doctor
Augustine. I’m no scientist.</p>
<p><strong>mo’at</strong>: What are you?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I don’t know. I was a Marine – uh, a warrior.
Of the Jarhead clan.</p>
<p>****: A warrior! I could kill him easily!</p>
<p>****: No! This is the first warrior dreamwalker we have seen. We need
to learn more about him.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What’s going on? What are they saying?</p>
<p><strong>mo’at</strong>: Daughter. You will teach him our way, to
speak and walk as we do.</p>
<p>****: Why me? That’s not fair! I only–</p>
<p>****: It is decided!</p>
<p><strong>mo’at</strong>: My daughter will teach you our ways. Learn
well, Jakesully. We will see if your insanity can be cured.</p>
<p>****: He is your responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: So it’s all good, right? You and me –</p>
<p><strong>neytiri</strong>: Do not speak.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Don’t get up.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You never told me your name.</p>
<p><strong>neytiri</strong>: Neytiri te Ckaha Mo’at’ite.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Okay, again, a whole lot slower.</p>
<p><strong>neytiri</strong>: Neytiri. Nay-TEE-ree.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Nay-TEE-ree. That’s nice. Nay-TEE-ree.</p>
<p>****: These aliens try to look like people, but they can’t.</p>
<p>****: He seems dim to me. And his eyes are too small.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Your mom likes me. I can tell.</p>
<p>****: Neytiri will test this “warrior.” Hey may learn nothing – but
we will learn much.</p>
<p><strong>eytukan</strong>: You speak truth. We must understand these
Sky People if we are to drive them out.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: These rock. What are they?</p>
<p><strong>neytiri</strong>: Teylu. You call beetle larvae.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: That’s some damn fine teylu. That’s like
grandma’s teylu.</p>
<p>****: I say she will kill him.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Come on back, kid, that’s it.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Wha –? Oh.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Damn, you were dug in like a tick. Is the
avatar safe?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Yeah, Doc – and you are not going to believe
where I am.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: – so the kid’s out there one night and he’s
got the Queen Bitch herself offering him the spare room and the car
keys. Unbelievable.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: It’s not something you can teach.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: That’s awesome, Jake.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: For reasons I cannot fathom, the Omaticaya
have chosen you. God help us all.</p>
<p><strong>quaritch</strong>: Jarhead clan? And that worked?</p>
<p>****: Yeah. They want to study me. See if I can learn to be one of
them.</p>
<p><strong>quaritch</strong>: That’s how you seize the initiative. I
wish I had ten more like you.</p>
<p><strong>selfridge</strong>: Look, Sully – find out what these blue
monkeys want.</p>
<p><strong>selfridge</strong>: Their damn village is sitting right over
the richest unobtanium deposit for a hundred klicks in any direction.
Which sucks – for them – because they need to relocate.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Does Augustine know about this?</p>
<p><strong>selfridge</strong>: Yeah, she does, and she’s on the next
ship back if she tries to cock-block me on it.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: So – who talks them into moving?</p>
<p>****: Guess.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What if they won’t go?</p>
<p>****: I’m betting they will.</p>
<p><strong>selfridge</strong>: Killing the indigenous looks bad, but
there’s one thing shareholders hate more than bad press – and that’s a
bad quarterly statement. Find me a carrot to get them to move, or it’s
going to have to be all stick.</p>
<p><strong>quaritch</strong>: You got three months. That’s when the
dozers get there.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’m on it.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Tsu’tey. Mo’at. Eytukan.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: He’s the clan leader – – but she’s the
spiritual leader. Like a shaman.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Got it. So who’s this Eywa?</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Who’s Eywa? Oh, only their deity. The Great
Mother. The goddess made up of all living things. You’d know that if you
had any training whatsoever.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Who’s got a date with the chief’s
daughter?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Knock it off. Jesus, it’s like kindergarten
around here.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Neytiri was my best student. She and her
sister Silwanin. Just amazing girls.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I didn’t meet the sister.</p>
<p>****: No, she’s dead. Okay, let’s go – village life starts early.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Link is ready.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Don’t do anything unusually stupid.</p>
<p><strong>neytiri</strong>: This is shahaylu – the bond. Feel her
heartbeat, her breath. Feel her strong legs.</p>
<p><strong>neytiri</strong>: You may tell her what to do – – inside. For
now, say where to go.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Forward.</p>
<p><strong>neytiri</strong>: Again.</p>
<p><strong>tsu’tey</strong>: You should go away.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I knew this guy could speak English.</p>
<p>****: This alien will learn nothing. A rock Sees more.</p>
<p><strong>neytiri</strong>: Again.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You’ve got outer columns, then a secondary
ring here, and an inner ring. Then a core structure, it’s like a spiral,
that’s how they move up and down.</p>
<p><strong>quaritch</strong>: I’m going to need accurate scans of all
these columns.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Roger that.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I’m not about to let Quaritch and Selfridge
micro-manage this thing. We’re going up into the mountains.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: The Hallelujah Mountains?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Yesssss! The legendary Floating Mountains of
Pandora? Heard of them?</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: It only takes tiny inputs. Here, put your
hand on the cyclic –</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: Feel how small the moves are? You barely have
to think it, and the aircraft reacts.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: See these magnetic formations. We’re getting
close.</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: Yeah we are. Look at my instruments.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Yup. We’re in the flux vortex.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Oh. My. God.</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: You should see your face.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Yeah, so what does hold them up? Grace
explained it to me – some kind of maglev effect because unobtanium is a
superconductor, or something. At least somebody understands it. Just not
me.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Jake, take number two, it’s the least
glitchy. Norm, I need you to operate Jake’s link.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Hey. You got a problem?</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: I trained three years for this mission. I
speak the language fluently. He falls off the frickin’ turnip truck and
all of a sudden he’s cultural ambassador!?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: It’s not our choice, Norm.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Yeah, well I didn’t come out here to wash the
dishes while you’re on some interspecies booty call.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: He can’t go far.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Let’s get you in.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Holy shit.</p>
<p><strong>neytiri</strong>: Do not look in her eye.</p>
<p><strong>neytiri</strong>: Ikran is not horse. Once shahaylu is made,
ikran will fly with only one Hunter in the whole life.</p>
<p><strong>neytiri</strong>: To become taronyu – Hunter – you must
choose your own ikran. And he must choose you.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>neytiri</strong>: When you are ready.</p>
<p><strong>neytiri</strong>: Heeyaaahh!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Do I have to do this? I need some rack.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: No – now, when it’s fresh.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Yeah, yeah. The days are starting to blur
together. The language is a bitch, but I figure it’s like
field-stripping a weapon. Repetition.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Seyri.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Ontu, mikyun, nari.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Neytiri thinks I’m some kind of retard.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Norm’s attitude has improved lately.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Thank you?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Ireiyo.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Irrrreiyo. Irrrreiyo. You’ve gotta roll the R,
r-r-r-oll it.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: It’s good he’s back on board, but he thinks
I’m a retard too.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: My feet are getting tougher. I can run farther
every day.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I have to trust my body to know what to do.
With Neytiri it’s learn fast or die.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I sweet-talked Mo’at into giving Norm and
Grace a hall pass. Now Grace even makes me coffee before link every
morning.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I See you, Neytiri Mo’at’ite.</p>
<p><strong>neytiri</strong>: I See you, Doctor Grace Augustine.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’m learning to read the trails, the tracks at
the water-hole, the tiniest scents and sounds.</p>
<p><strong>neytiri</strong>: When you hear nothing, you will hear
everything. When you see nothing, you will See everything.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Sometimes I have no idea what she’s talking
about.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: It’s been a month and I’m still not allowed to
make a kill. She says the forest hasn’t given permission.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: There’s a lot of crap like that. She’s always
going on about the flow of energy– the spirits of the animals and what
not –</p>
<p>****: I just hope this treehugger shit isn’t on the final.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: This isn’t just about eye-hand coordination
out there. You need to listen to what she says. Try to see the forest
through their eyes.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Excuse me – this is my video-log here,
okay?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Everything is backwards now. Like out there is
the true world, and in here is the dream.</p>
<p>****: I See you Brother, and thank you. Your spirit goes with Eywa,
your body stays behind to become part of the People.</p>
<p><strong>neytiri</strong>: A clean kill. You are ready.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You’re still losing weight. Here –</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I made a kill today. We ate it. I know where
that meal came from.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Other body. You need to take care of this
body.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Yeah yeah.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Jake, I’m serious – you look like crap.
You’re burning too hard.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Get rid of this shit, then you can lecture
me.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I’m telling you, as your boss and someone who
might even consider being a friend someday, to take some down time.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Not now. Tomorrow we leave for Iknimaya.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Yeah – you’re gonna go ride a banshee. Or die
trying.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: That’s right, Grace. This is what I’ve been
working for.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: And this is your check up from the neck up,
Marine. You’re getting in way too deep. Trust me, I learned the hard
way.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What did happen at the school?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Neytiri’s sister – Sylwanin – stopped coming
to school. She was angry about the clear-cutting.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: One day, she and a couple of other young
hunters came running in, all painted up – they’d set a bulldozer on fire
– I guess they thought I could protect them.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: The troopers pursued them to the
schoolhouse.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: They killed Sylwanin in the doorway. Right in
front of Neytiri. Then shot the others.</p>
<p>****: I got most of the kids out, before they shot me.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: A scientist stays objective – we can not be
ruled by emotion. But I poured ten years of my life into that school.
They called me sa’atenuk. Mother. That kind of pain reaches back through
the link.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: It’s a job. Learn what you can – but don’t
get attached.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: It’s not our world, Jake. And we can’t stop
what’s coming.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Iknimaya translates roughly as stairway to
heaven. It’s the test every young hunter has to pass.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: We doin’ this?</p>
<p><strong>tsu’tey</strong>: Jakesully will go first.</p>
<p>****: Now you choose your ikran. This you must feel – inside. If he
also chooses you, move quick, like I showed. You will have one
chance.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: How will I know if he chooses me?</p>
<p><strong>neytiri</strong>: He will try to kill you.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Outstanding.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Let’s dance.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: That’s right! You’re mine.</p>
<p><strong>neytiri</strong>: First flight seals the bond. You cannot
wait.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Heeeyyyaaaah!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Shut the hell up!!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Level out! Fly straight!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I may not be much of a horse guy. But I was
born to do this.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: The Great Leonopteryx is the apex aerial
predator. Not only rare, but the sightings tend not to get reported.</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: There usually isn’t time to key the mike.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: The People call it Toruk.</p>
<p>****: Last Shadow.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Last one you ever see.</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: I saw one take out a gunship once – WHAM!
Total frickin’ yard sale. Ate the crew like peanuts.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Vitraya Ramunong – The Well of Souls. It’s
their most sacred place.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Something big is going on in there,
biologically. I’d die to get samples, but outsiders are strictly
forbidden.</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: They’re coming back.</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: If you don’t give him something, he’s gonna
shut us down.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Hey, guys.</p>
<p><strong>neytiri</strong>: My grandfather’s grandfather was Toruk
Macto – Rider of Last Shadow. Toruk chose him. It has only happened five
times since the time of the First Songs.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: That’s a long time.</p>
<p><strong>neytiri</strong>: Toruk Macto was mighty – he brought the
clans together in a time of great sorrow. All Na’vi people know this
story.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Watch that stuff. It’ll knock you into next
week.</p>
<p><strong>tsu’tey</strong>: I thought – enough drink – you would not be
so ugly.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>tsu’tey</strong>: Your warriors – hide inside machines –
fight from far away. I did not think a sky person could be brave.</p>
<p><strong>neytiri</strong>: You must dance! It is the way.</p>
<p>****: We cannot let this seed grow. Her path is with Tsu’tey.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: It’s hard to put in words the deep connection
the People have to the forest.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: They see a network of energy that flows
through all living things. They know that all energy is only
borrowed–</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: – and one day you have to give it back.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Hard to believe it’s only been three
months.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I can barely remember my old life. I’m not
sure who I am anymore.</p>
<p><strong>selfridge</strong>: Good of you to stop by. How’s it going
out there? Our blue friends all packed up yet?</p>
<p><strong>selfridge</strong>: See, I keep hooking it. It’s the damn
pack.</p>
<p><strong>selfridge</strong>: The low gravity and the high air density
cancel out so –</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You called us back to report – you want to
hear it or not?</p>
<p><strong>selfridge</strong>: Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Jake is making incredible progress, years
worth in just a few months. But – we need more time.</p>
<p><strong>selfridge</strong>: Not what I was hoping to hear.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Parker, it’s their ancestral home. They’ve
lived there since before human history began. You can spare them a few
more weeks.</p>
<p><strong>selfridge</strong>: This thing is inevitable. What does it
matter when it happens? I’m sorry, Dr. Augustine. You’re out of
time.</p>
<p><strong>quaritch</strong>: You’re not gettin’ lost in the woods, are
you son?</p>
<p><strong>quaritch</strong>: Your last report was two weeks ago. I’m
starting to doubt your resolve. From what I see, it’s time to terminate
this mission.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: No. I can do this.</p>
<p><strong>quaritch</strong>: Look, you’ve given me plenty of usable
intel. Like this “Well of Souls” place – I’ve got them by the balls with
that, when it turns into a shit-fight. Which it will.</p>
<p><strong>quaritch</strong>: So you’ll get your legs back, like I
promised.</p>
<p>****: It’s time to come in.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’ve gotta finish this thing. There’s one more
test – the Dream Hunt. It’s the final stage of becoming a man. Then I’m
one of them. They’ll trust what I say…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: … and I can negotiate the terms of their
relocation.</p>
<p><strong>quaritch</strong>: Then you need to get it done,
Corporal.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Jake, I can’t allow this. You’re just not
strong enough.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: It’s the last door – I’m going through it. You
can help me or get out of the way.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Will you listen to me? Sometimes the Na’vi
themselves die in these vision quests. The venom takes you to the edge
of death.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Calibrating. Thirty seconds.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: No matter what you prove out there– you are
still in here. Right here.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I have to go all the way – become one of</p>
<p>****: Goddammit, Jake, you can never be one of them!</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Our life out there takes millions of dollars
of machinery to sustain. You visit – and you leave.</p>
<p>****: You can never truly be with her.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You know why I’m here? Because Quaritch sent
me.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: That’s right – to embed with the Omaticaya. To
find out how to screw them out of their home. By deceit or by force, he
didn’t care. And if it turned out to be force, then how best to do
it.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: And what about now, Jake?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’m not that guy any more.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: But if I tell Quaritch the truth, he yanks me
out – I never see her again. And if I tell her the truth, the clan
throws me out – that’s if they don’t cut my heart out and show it to
me.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: They won’t understand what you’ve done.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: They don’t even have a word for “lie” – they
had to learn it from us.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I know. I taught it to them.</p>
<p>****: Grace. I’ve gotta go. They’re waiting.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Link is ready.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Jake. You can’t carry this burden much
longer.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: It’s okay. Mo’at says an alien mind probably
can’t survive the Dream Hunt anyway.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Prep my link. I’m going in.</p>
<p><strong>neytiri</strong>: When your Spirit Animal comes, you will
know.</p>
<p>****: Oh wise worm, eater of the Sacred Tree – bless this worthy
Hunter with a true vision.</p>
<p><strong>mo’at</strong>: It is finished.</p>
<p>****: Did your Spirit Animal come?</p>
<p><strong>mo’at</strong>: Something has come. It will take time for the
meaning to be clear.</p>
<p>****: You are now a son of the Omaticaya. You are part of the
People.</p>
<p><strong>neytiri</strong>: This is a place for prayers to be heard.
And sometimes answered.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: It’s like – a sound you feel.</p>
<p><strong>neytiri</strong>: We call this utraya mokri – the Tree of
Voices. The voices of our ancestors, who live within Eywa.</p>
<p><strong>neytiri</strong>: You are Omaticaya now. You may make your
own bow from the wood of Hometree. And you may choose a woman.</p>
<p><strong>neytiri</strong>: We have many fine women. Ninat is the best
singer –</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I don’t want Ninat.</p>
<p><strong>neytiri</strong>: There is Beyral – she is a good hunter
–</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’ve already chosen. But this woman must also
choose me.</p>
<p><strong>neytiri</strong>: She already has.</p>
<p><strong>neytiri</strong>: Kissing is very good. But we have something
better.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Neytiri, you know my real body is far away,
sleeping.</p>
<p><strong>neytiri</strong>: This body is real. This spirit is real.</p>
<p><strong>neytiri</strong>: When I was first your teacher, I hated all
Sky People. But you have also taught me.</p>
<p>****: Spirit is all that matters.</p>
<p><strong>neytiri</strong>: I am with you now, Jake. We are mated for
life.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: We are?</p>
<p><strong>neytiri</strong>: Yes. It is our way.</p>
<p>****: Oh. I forgot to tell?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Really, we are?</p>
<p><strong>neytiri</strong>: We are.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: It’s cool. I’m there.</p>
<p><strong>neytiri</strong>: Jake! Wake up! Where ever you are, come
back to me now. Jake!</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Here – eat this. I’d hate to have to
force-feed a cripple.</p>
<p>****: She’s not going anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: And when was the last time you took a shower?
Jesus, Marine.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Hey! Heeeey! Stop! Stop!</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Hey, I got one of the natives blockin’ my
blade here.</p>
<p><strong>supervisor</strong>: What do we do?</p>
<p><strong>selfridge</strong>: Roll on. He’ll move. These people have to
learn that we don’t stop.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: I’m blind.</p>
<p><strong>quaritch</strong>: Freeze it, right – there.</p>
<p><strong>selfridge</strong>: Son of a bitch!</p>
<p><strong>quaritch</strong>: Get me a pilot!</p>
<p>****: Tsu’tey will lead the war party!</p>
<p>****: Please – this will only make it worse –</p>
<p><strong>tsu’tey</strong>: You do not speak here!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Okay, listen. There’s something I have to tell
you. It’s gonna be hard. I just need you to –</p>
<p><strong>tsu’tey</strong>: You!</p>
<p><strong>tsu’tey</strong>: You mated with this woman?!</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Oh shit.</p>
<p><strong>mo’at</strong>: Is this true?</p>
<p>****: We are mated before Eywa. It is done.</p>
<p>****: Neytiri was promised to me! Everything is changing. Everything
is being destroyed!</p>
<p>****: These aliens kill everything they touch, like poison.</p>
<p><strong>mo’at</strong>: Neytiri! If you choose this path, you can
never be Tsahik. Your life will be wasted.</p>
<p><strong>neytiri</strong>: I have chosen.</p>
<p><strong>tsu’tey</strong>: Yeeeeeaaa!</p>
<p>****: Stop! This is not a proper challenge.</p>
<p><strong>tsu’tey</strong>: I challenge you.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Jake, don’t –</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I accept.</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: Loveshack this is Samson One Six inbound hot
to your pos. I have Colonel Quaritch with me and –</p>
<p><strong>quaritch</strong>: Did I tell you to announce us?</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: Sorry sir, it’s procedure.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Samson One Six? Trudy? Crap.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: What the hell are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: It’s the only way to get him to goddamn
listen.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Hey, hang on, you can’t interrupt a link in
progress, it’s dangerous – wait!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Are you out of your goddamn mind?!</p>
<p><strong>quaritch</strong>: You crossed a line.</p>
<p>****: This is a demon in a false body. It should not live.</p>
<p><strong>quaritch</strong>: You let me down, son. You got a little
local pussy and completely forgot what team you play for.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Parker, listen, there may still be time to
–</p>
<p><strong>quaritch</strong>: Shut your fucking hole!</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Or what, Ranger Rick? You gonna shoot me? You
need to muzzle your dog!</p>
<p><strong>selfridge</strong>: Can we just take this down a couple
notches, please.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You say you want to keep your people alive.
Start by listening to her.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: This is bad, Parker. Those trees were sacred
to the Omaticaya in a way you can’t imagine.</p>
<p><strong>selfridge</strong>: You know what? You throw a stick in the
air around here it falls on some sacred fern.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I’m not talking about pagan voodoo here – I’m
talking about something real and measurable in the biology of the
forest.</p>
<p>****: Which is what exactly?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I can’t do this. How am I supposed to reduce
years of work to a sound bite for the illiterate?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Just tell him what you know in your heart.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Alright, look – I don’t have the answers yet,
I’m just now starting to even frame the questions. What we think we know
– is that there’s some kind of electrochemical communication between the
roots of the trees. Like the synapses between neurons. Each tree has ten
to the fourth connections to the trees around it, and there are ten to
the twelfth trees on Pandora –</p>
<p><strong>selfridge</strong>: That’s a lot I’m guessing.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: That’s more connections than the human brain.
You get it? It’s a network – a global network. And the Na’vi can access
it – they can upload and download data – memories – at sites like the
one you destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>selfridge</strong>: What the hell have you people been
smoking out there? They’re just. Goddamn. Trees.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You need to wake up, Parker. The wealth of
this world isn’t in the ground – it’s all around us. The Na’vi know
that, and they’re fighting to defend it. If you want to share this world
with them, you need to understand them.</p>
<p><strong>quaritch</strong>: We understand them just fine. Thanks to
Jake here.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: They’re not going to give up their home –
they’re not gonna make a deal. For what? Lite beer and shopping channel?
There’s nothing we have that they want. We’re a horror to them. We’re
the monsters from space.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: They’re never going to leave Hometree.</p>
<p><strong>quaritch</strong>: Since a deal can’t be made – it gets real
simple. So thanks. I’m getting all emotional. I might just give you a
big wet kiss.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Parker, we have to talk, like rational
people.</p>
<p><strong>selfridge</strong>: Well, I’d cherish that, but unfortunately
you’re out of here on the next shuttle. All of you. I’m shutting down
the Avatar Program, effective now.</p>
<p><strong>wainfleet</strong>: They hit with banshees first. Set the
ampsuit on fire. Driver’s toast.</p>
<p><strong>quaritch</strong>: The rest of the squad?</p>
<p><strong>wainfleet</strong>: Six bodies – that’s all of `em. And the
equipment is totalled.</p>
<p><strong>selfridge</strong>: Christ.</p>
<p><strong>quaritch</strong>: I can do it with minimal casualties to the
indigenous. We’ll clear them out with gas first. It’ll be humane. More
or less.</p>
<p><strong>quaritch</strong>: Hey, don’t go limp on me now. This is
exactly the incident we needed.</p>
<p><strong>selfridge</strong>: Alright, let’s pull the trigger.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: They bulldozed a sacred site on purpose, to
trigger a response. They’re fabricating this war to get what they
want.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: I can’t believe that.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Yup. That’s how it’s done. When people are
sitting on shit you want, you make them your enemy. Then you’re
justified in taking it.</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: Sec-ops is rolling the gunships. They’re
gonna hit Hometree!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: Now. We’re spooling up now! I gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: My God.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Parker, wait. Stop! These are people you’re
about to –</p>
<p><strong>selfridge</strong>: They’re fly-bitten savages who live in a
tree! Look around – I don’t know about you but I see a lot of trees.
They can move.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: For God’s sake, there are children in there.
Babies!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Look Selfridge, you don’t want this kind of
blood on your hands. Let me try to talk them out. They trust me.</p>
<p><strong>selfridge</strong>: You’ve got one hour. Unless you want your
girlfriend in there when the axe comes down, you get them to evacuate.
One hour.</p>
<p>****: Eytukan, I have something to say, to everyone.</p>
<p>****: Speak, Jakesully.</p>
<p>****: A great evil is upon us. The Sky People are coming to destroy
Hometree. They will be here soon.</p>
<p>****: You have to leave, or you will die.</p>
<p><strong>mo’at</strong>: Are you certain of this?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: They sent me here to learn your ways. So one
day I could bring this message, and you would believe it.</p>
<p><strong>neytiri</strong>: What are you saying, Jake? You knew this
would happen?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p>****: At first it was just orders. Then everything changed. I fell in
love– with the forest, with the Omaticaya People – – with you. And by
then, how could I tell you?</p>
<p><strong>neytiri</strong>: I trusted you, Jake!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Neytiri. Please, I only wanted to –</p>
<p><strong>neytiri</strong>: You will never be one of the People!</p>
<p>****: Bind them.</p>
<p><strong>quaritch</strong>: Well, I’d say diplomacy has failed.</p>
<p><strong>quaritch</strong>: I think they mean to cut their throats if
we don’t back off. Make sure you get a nice close-up of that. I can tack
it onto the after-action report.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You have to get out of Hometree! Run to the
forest! Please, I’m begging you!</p>
<p>****: Take the ikran! Attack from above!</p>
<p><strong>quaritch</strong>: Alright, let’s get this done. Give me
forty millimeter gas rounds, right in the front door.</p>
<p><strong>gunner</strong>: Roger. CS forties. Going hot.</p>
<p><strong>quaritch</strong>: Fire.</p>
<p><strong>eytukan</strong>: Everybody outside! Go to the Forest.</p>
<p><strong>mo’at</strong>: You are one of us. Help us!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: We’ve gotta move! He’s gonna blow the
columns.</p>
<p><strong>quaritch</strong>: That’s how you scatter the roaches. Okay,
switch missiles. Give me H-E’s at the base of the west columns.</p>
<p><strong>pilots</strong>: Copy, switching missiles.</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: Screw it.</p>
<p><strong>quaritch</strong>: Bring it down.</p>
<p><strong>quaritch</strong>: Nice work people. Alright, let’s light it
up.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Neytiri! Neytiri!</p>
<p>****: Daughter – take my bow. Protect the People.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’m sorry –</p>
<p><strong>neytiri</strong>: Get away from me, Jake. Go away! Never come
back!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I was a warrior who dreamed he could bring
peace. Sooner or later though, you always have to wake up…</p>
<p><strong>selfridge</strong>: Pull the plug.</p>
<p>****: Bring her.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: They never wanted us to succeed.</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: Personally I think steak’s too good for these
traitors.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: They get steak? That’s bullshit. Let me see
that –</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: Oops. All the way down, pendejo.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: That was unexpectedly satisfying.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Baby, you rock.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: So what do you say? Time for a revolution?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I’m free.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Get your ship fired up.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Stay here. I need somebody on the inside I can
trust.</p>
<p><strong>trooper</strong>: I need you to shut down and step out of the
vehicle! Now!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Take it nice and easy, troop.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: On the ground, face down. Hands behind your
head.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Do what he goddamn says!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Go! Go! Go!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Oh yeah, baby!</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Aaahh, crap. Not again.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: This is gonna ruin my whole day.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Hang on, Grace.</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: Well, at least they won’t be able to track us
up here. Not this deep in the vortex.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: It’s strongest at the Well of Souls,
right?</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Good, `cause that’s where we’re going.</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: Copy.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’m gonna get you some help, Grace.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Forget it, it doesn’t matter.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: No! The People can help you. I know it.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: The Well of Souls. The heart of the forest. I
knew the People would go there.</p>
<p>****: Wise ancestors who live within Eywa, guide us. Give us a
sign.</p>
<p>****: Tsu’tey is Olo’eyctan now. He’s not going to let you get near
that place.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’ve gotta try, Norm.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Outcast. Betrayer. Alien. To ever face them
again, I was gonna have to change the rules.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Sometimes your whole life boils down to one
insane move.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Come on, boy. Time to fly.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: The way I had it figured, Toruk is the baddest
cat in the sky. Nothing attacks him. So why would he ever look up?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: But that was just a theory.</p>
<p><strong>neytiri</strong>: Toruk Macto.</p>
<p>****: Toruk Macto!</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: Toruk Macto… Toruk Macto…</p>
<p><strong>neytiri</strong>: I See you.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I See you.</p>
<p><strong>neytiri</strong>: I was afraid Jake – for my people. I’m not
any more.</p>
<p>****: Tsu’tey of the Rongloa, son of Ateyo. I stand before you, ready
to serve the People. You are Olo’eyctan, and you are the best warrior. I
can’t do this without you.</p>
<p><strong>tsu’tey</strong>: I will fly with you.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Ireiyo.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Grace is dying. I beg the help of the Great
Mother.</p>
<p><strong>mo’at</strong>: Bring her, Jakesully.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Look where we are, Grace.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I need to take some samples.</p>
<p>****: The Great Mother may choose to save all that she is –</p>
<p><strong>mo’at</strong>: – in this body.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Is that possible?</p>
<p><strong>mo’at</strong>: Possible, yes. She must pass through the Eye
of Eywa – and return. But Jakesully– she is very weak.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Hang on, they’re gonna fix you up.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I – always held back. But you gave them your
heart. I’m proud of you, Jake.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Help them. You do whatever it takes. You hear
me?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I will.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I’m with her Jake – – she’s real –</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Grace!</p>
<p><strong>mo’at</strong>: Her wounds were too great, there was not
enough time. She is with Eywa now.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: With your permission, I will Speak now. You
would honor me by translating.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: The Sky People have sent a message that they
can take whatever they want, and no one can stop them. But we will send
them a message. Ride out, as fast as the wind can carry you, tell the
other clans to come. Tell them Toruk Macto calls to them. Fly now with
me brothers and sisters! Fly! And we will show the Sky People that this
is our land!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: We rode out to the four winds. To the horse
clans of the plain, to the ikran people of the mountains. When Toruk
Macto called them, they came.</p>
<p><strong>quaritch</strong>: People, you are fighting for survival.
There’s an aboriginal horde out there massing for an attack. First
slide.</p>
<p><strong>quaritch</strong>: These orbital images show the hostiles’
numbers have gone from a couple of hundred to over two thousand in one
day, and more are pouring in. By next week it could be twenty thousand.
Then they’ll be overrunning our perimeter here. We can’t wait. Our only
security lies in pre- emptive attack. We will fight terror with
terror.</p>
<p><strong>quaritch</strong>: Next slide. This mountain stronghold is
supposedly protected by their deity. When we destroy it, we will blast a
crater in their racial memory so deep they won’t come within a thousand
klicks of this place.</p>
<p><strong>selfridge</strong>: This thing is completely out of
control!</p>
<p><strong>selfridge</strong>: Listen to me! I am not authorizing you to
turn the mine-workers local into a freakin’ militia!</p>
<p><strong>quaritch</strong>: I declared threat condition red. That puts
all on-world assets under my command.</p>
<p><strong>selfridge</strong>: You think you can pull this palace coup
shit on me?! I can have your ass with one call –</p>
<p><strong>quaritch</strong>: You’re a long way from Earth.</p>
<p><strong>quaritch</strong>: Get him out of here.</p>
<p><strong>selfridge</strong>: You touch me you’re so fired.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I don’t know how secure this channel is.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Talk fast.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: It’s crazy here, Jake. It’s full mobilization.
They’re rigging the shuttles as bombers. They’ve made up these big
pallets of mine explosives. It’s for some kind of shock and awe
campaign.</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: Frickin’ daisycutters.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Holy shit.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Can you talk to Selfridge? Maybe we can cut
some kinda deal before this thing goes all the way.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: No, Quaritch has taken over. He’s rolling and
there’s no stopping him.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Oh six hundred tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: We’re screwed.</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: You know he’s gonna commit those bombers
straight to the Well of Souls.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: That’s right. Because I gave it to him on a
plate.</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: We both did.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: If he takes out the Well of Souls – it’s over.
It’s their main line to Eywa, to their ancestors – it’ll destroy
them.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Then I guess we better stop him.</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: You need to get some rack.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Gonna have to settle for coffee.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I was a warrior who dreamed he could bring
peace. But there was only one thing I was ever really good at.
Ooh-rah.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Strike here and here.</p>
<p>****: You know our chances suck.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: Going up against gunships with bows and
arrows…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What’s your point?</p>
<p>****: Right.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’ve never done this in my life.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: And I’m probably just talking to a tree right
now. But if you’re there – I need to give you a heads up.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: If Grace is there with you – look in her
memories – she can show you the world we come from. There’s no green
there. They killed their Mother, and they’re gonna do the same thing
here.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: More Sky People are gonna come. They’re gonna
come like a rain that never ends –</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: – until they’ve covered the world. Unless we
stop them.</p>
<p><strong>neytiri</strong>: Our Great Mother does not take sides. She
protects only the balance of life.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: It was worth a try.</p>
<p><strong>wainfleet</strong>: Contact. Two hundred meters.</p>
<p><strong>quaritch</strong>: Fire for effect.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Jake! Jake! We’re falling back!</p>
<p><strong>quaritch</strong>: Blue team, switch forties. Fire at
will.</p>
<p><strong>troopers</strong>: Yeah baby! Get some!</p>
<p><strong>quaritch</strong>: Blue team, stay with the ground units. Red
team, with me. We’re punching for the main target.</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: You’re not the only ones with guns, you
pricks.</p>
<p><strong>quaritch</strong>: There it is. Valkyrie One, this is Dragon.
Target is in sight.</p>
<p><strong>trooper</strong>: Target in sight.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: We have to stop the shuttles, no matter what
it takes.</p>
<p><strong>wainfleet</strong>: I hear this is worse than death for you,
chief.</p>
<p><strong>trooper</strong>: Right flank – something’s coming! It’s all
lit up out there.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What the hell – ?</p>
<p><strong>wainfleet</strong>: A and C squads – rally at my pos. I want
– Who’s screaming God damn it?!</p>
<p><strong>trooper</strong>: We gotta get outta here! Whoever’s in
charge, call for extraction!</p>
<p><strong>wainfleet</strong>: Shutup you crybabies!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Rogue One, Rogue One, this is Max. Tell Jake we
are in motion. Get in there. Barricade the door!</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Mains to a hundred percent! Get me
airspeed!</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: We’re good!</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Valkyrie Two is breaking off. And if any of
ya’ll want to get off this piece of shit planet, you better cover our
ass, `cause we’re the only way back to orbit.</p>
<p><strong>gunship pilot</strong>: Roger that.</p>
<p><strong>quaritch</strong>: Get back here you worthless pukes!</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Are we breaking off?</p>
<p><strong>quaritch</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>selfridge</strong>: What the hell is going on out there?</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Sir, all ground units are falling back to the
LZ.</p>
<p><strong>quaritch</strong>: Stay on target.</p>
<p><strong>quaritch</strong>: Switch missiles. Arm all pods.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Arming.</p>
<p><strong>quaritch</strong>: Let’s see what these blue bastards do when
I bitch-slap their goddess.</p>
<p><strong>quaritch</strong>: Put your mask on.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Quaritch is gonna take out the Well of Souls!
He’s got a clear shot. Hit him, anybody that can! Do it now!</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: On it.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: Norm, I love you.</p>
<p><strong>trooper</strong>: Dragon is down. It’s off the board.</p>
<p><strong>selfridge</strong>: What do you mean, off the board?!</p>
<p><strong>selfridge</strong>: Oh shit.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: It’s all over Quaritch –</p>
<p><strong>quaritch</strong>: Nothing’s over while I’m breathing.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Kinda hoped you’d say that.</p>
<p><strong>quaritch</strong>: How does it feel to betray your own
race?</p>
<p>****: I See you, Jakesully.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I See you, Tsu’tey te Rongloa Ateyitan.</p>
<p><strong>tsu’tey</strong>: Are the people safe?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: They’re safe.</p>
<p><strong>tsu’tey</strong>: I can never ride again, or bond with my
woman – or hear the voice of Eywa. I can not lead the People. You will
lead them, Jakesully.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: No. I’m not officer material.</p>
<p><strong>tsu’tey</strong>: It is decided. Now do the duty of
Olo’eyctan. Set my spirit free.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’m not killing you.</p>
<p><strong>tsu’tey</strong>: I am already dead.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>tsu’tey</strong>: It is the way. And it is good. I will be
remembered –</p>
<p><strong>tsu’tey</strong>: – I fought with Toruk Macto, we were
brothers – and he was my last shadow.</p>
<p>****: Forgive me, my Brother. Go now to the Mother Spirit.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: A few chose to stay. Fewer were chosen.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: The forest will heal, and so will the hearts
of the People. New life keeps the energy flowing, like the breath of the
world.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: This is my last videolog.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: The science guys will keep the lights on,
here. But I won’t miss this place.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I better wrap this up. There’s a funeral
tonight, and I don’t want to be late. It was someone very close to
me.</p>
