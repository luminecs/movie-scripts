<p><strong>ext. sky-day</strong>: A Black B-1 Bomber banks steeply
exposing its underside to us.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Slingshot this is Watchdog. Rabbit’s home.</p>
<p><strong>bomber pilot</strong>: Roger watchdog. Understand we are go
for crossbow.</p>
<p><strong>int. b-1 flight deck-day</strong>: THE PLANE VIBRATES. The
pilot and co-pilot are busy in their seats. Behind them sits a third
pilot wearing a space suit. He gives them a thumbs-up signal, rises and
crawls to the rear.</p>
<p><strong>bomber pilot</strong>: Watchdog, Slingshot. let us know when
the rabbit’s in the hole.</p>
<p><strong>ext. a crowd-day</strong>: A blond haired, blue-eyed man with
a small walkie-talkie is standing in the midst of a group of cheering
Central American peasants and townsfolk. He is disguised as one of
them.</p>
<p><strong>ext. b-1 bomber-day</strong>: The bomber approaches the top
of it’s arc.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: The shuttle pilot climbs into his seat,
straps in and checks his instruments.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle pilot</strong>: All systems check. Crossbow is
armed.</p>
<p><strong>bomber pilot</strong>: Roger, Ignition sequence, start,
separation in five…</p>
<p><strong>ext. top of the bomber</strong>: The explosive bolts blow on
the shuttle mount.</p>
<p><strong>int. bomber flight deck</strong>: The pilot pushes his yolk
forward.</p>
<p><strong>ext. bomber</strong>: As the bomber falls way, the shuttle’s
booster ignites with a roar, thrusting it toward space.</p>
<p><strong>ext. space-looking back</strong>: We see a tiny glowing speck
coming towards us. very quickly it gains in altitude and we see that it
is the shuttle. Suddenly it is upon us and blasts over our heads.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle pilot</strong>: Crossbow is established.</p>
<p><strong>bomber pilot</strong>: Roger, we have ground confirmation.
Reference grid seven. Check pathfinder, on.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle pilot</strong>: Roger, I’m going on the scope. Moving
Target Indicator, engage.</p>
<p><strong>int. shuttle</strong>: The pilot reaches above him and pulls
down a viewfinder and begins looking through it.</p>
<p><strong>ext. the shuttle.</strong>: A target sighting lens moves from
right to left, stops, and then moves back but this time with the mirror
moving in unison.</p>
<p><strong>int. the shuttle</strong>: While still looking through the
viewfinder, the pilot manipulates the targeting controls.</p>
<p><strong>pilot’s pov of the screen</strong>: Crosshairs, a grid patter
and digital, rangefinder readouts appear over various parts of the
Earth’s topography as the pilot searches for his target. Then it
steadies on a polarized image of a group of people. One of the images
seems to stand out brighter than the others.</p>
<p><strong>ext. villa patio-day</strong>: The president and his aide are
chatting with a group of visiting dignitaries. There is a jovial
atmosphere as they order drinks from a waiter. The president is proudly
displaying one of his medals to his guests. it has a very unique
jewel-like object in its middle.</p>
<p><strong>int. the shuttle</strong>: The pilot is watching through the
viewfinder.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Scanner on. Target locked. Tracking
locked.</p>
<p><strong>ext. the shuttle</strong>: The mirror and sighting lens
adjust as they track the target.</p>
<p><strong>ext. villa patio</strong>: The President is served a cup of
coffee. He asks the waiter for sugar. The waiter turns back to his
cart.</p>
<p><strong>int. the shuttle</strong>: The pilot puts his hands on the
joysticks and flips open the trigger covers.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Nice and easy does it.</p>
<p><strong>ext. the shuttle</strong>: Dead silence, then the mirror
erupts in brilliant light and sends an incredibly bright beam toward the
Earth. Behind the shuttle we see exhaust gases venting in giant plumes
into space.</p>
<p><strong>ext. villa patio</strong>: The beam strikes the president
like the finger of god. He vaporizes. The waiter turns back with the
asked-for sugar to find a smoking hole where the President once
stood.</p>
<p><strong>ext. space</strong>: The shuttle finishes its work and the
beam shuts down. The mirror folds away and the shuttle arcs across the
screen preparing for re-entry, firing small retro rockets.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: I’m coming home. Just like shooting ducks in
a barrel.</p>
<p><strong>int. a high-level government conference room-no
windows</strong>: A large screen at one end of the room continues to
show the re-entry.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: The Crossbow Project. There’s no defense
like a good offense.</p>
<p><strong>carmichael</strong>: Nice little weapon isn’t it, Dave?</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Well, I guess so, but gosh, Don, it’s a
movie. You want me to start buying weapons from George Lucas?</p>
<p><strong>carmichael</strong>: Now that would be somethin’, wouldn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Well, sometimes I think I might as well.
What do you think of what you saw, Roy?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: I think there weren’t enough girls. More polite
laughter. Then Roy turns ice cold in a flash.</p>
<p><strong>carmichael</strong>: No, Sir, this thing would take the skin
right off, of Air Force One if you wanted. Not that I’m saying we’d ever
want to kill our own President, but, you know, for example.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Our studies indicate that this type of weapon
is totally useless for warfare.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: It’s not intended for use in your kind of
warfare, Roy. This is a perfect peace time weapon.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: What’s the kill potential?</p>
<p><strong>carmichael</strong>: As soon as the size-to power ratio is
licked we’ll have about seven bangs for the buck.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: When that?</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Seriously, Don, I have to report to the
Secretary that everything’s on schedule. We have plans for your little
ray’s gun this summer.</p>
<p><strong>carmichael</strong>: As I understand it, guys, there’s some
major practical difficulties. I’m pushing as hard as I can.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Well, Don, you tell those geniuses you’ve
got until the end of the next fiscal quarter to come up with a working
model or I’m pulling the plug on the funding.</p>
<p><strong>carmichael</strong>: I’m assured they’re on the verge of a
major breakthrough.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Good. Just as long as we get a working
weapon out of it by June. Right, general?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: I wouldn’t know, Dave. I haven’t had a working
weapon since Korea.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Right. Larry, let’s see the film on blinding
techniques, then we’ll have some lunch, all right?</p>
<p><strong>int. exhibition hall -day</strong>: WE OPEN on a sign:
“Effects of marijuana on Rodents.” A cage is divided in half. One side
is marked “NO Marijuana.” A chinchilla is running furiously on a
treadmill. The other side is marked “Marijuana.” A chinchilla is lying
in a little hammock.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: It doesn’t seem to be working; but if it was,
these gases would be going around.</p>
<p><strong>a boy</strong>: We don’t care.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Hi, my name is Harry. Let me guess your
weight and age…midget mutant; weight…</p>
<p><strong>old lady</strong>: Are you Dr. Atherton?</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Yes, dear.</p>
<p><strong>old lady</strong>: I just love your television show.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Well, thank you. We try.</p>
<p><strong>old lady</strong>: What’s Albert Einstein really like?</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Dead.</p>
<p><strong>old lady</strong>: Oh, I thought you had him on.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: No, that was just an actor.</p>
<p><strong>old lady</strong>: Is everyone an actor, then?</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: No, I’m a physicist.</p>
<p><strong>old lady</strong>: But Einstein isn’t?</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Nice talking to you.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: See, Dad, it’s coherent light.</p>
<p><strong>mr. simon</strong>: It talks?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. simon</strong>: Dr. ATHERTON, what a surprise.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Hello, Mrs. Simon. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>mr. simon</strong>: No problem with Mitch’s test scores or
anything, is there?</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: No, no. I just thought I’d stop by, bring
you the good news myself. I just got word from the admissions committee.
We did it. Mitch is in.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. simon</strong>: Isn’t that wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Hello, Mitch.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Nice little display?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Thanks</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: What’s your medium?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Just Argon. But I have it all structured for
HF if I could get some.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: That would be interesting.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: It’s all theoretical at this stage, but I
have the power supply completely worked out.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Very nice.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: You must be very proud. he’s the first
student we’ve ever accepted for winter term entrance at Pacific
Tech.</p>
<p><strong>mr. simon</strong>: I image he’s the youngest, too.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: No, actually. The youngest we’ve had was a
twelve, but he cracked under the pressure within six months so we don’t
really count him.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. simon</strong>: Fifteen year old and off to college.
Image.</p>
<p><strong>mr. simon</strong>: Listen Doc. This scholarship thing, does
he get any kind of whatya call it, signing bonus sort of thing?</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Well, no…but by allowing Mitch to progress
at an accelerated rate we give him the opportunity to fulfill a far
greater portion of his remarkable intellectual potential. Don’t you
agree?</p>
<p><strong>mr. simon</strong>: Yeah, I guess. It’s just that athletes
get, you know, cars and stuff.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Well, I guess we scientists are a little
different than athletes.</p>
<p><strong>mr. simon</strong>: Cheaper.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Smarter</p>
<p><strong>mr. simon</strong>: Not when it comes to getting cars.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. simon</strong>: We just want the best for Mitchie.
Dr. Atherton, I saw your show the other night, about radioactive
isotopes, and I have a question for you.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Oh, yes?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. simon</strong>: Is that your real hair?</p>
<p><strong>mr. simon</strong>: Well, I wondered that, too.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Well, interesting question, when you
consider the philosophical aspects of whether anything on television is
“real” or actually just an “image” being broadcast.</p>
<p><strong>mr. simon</strong>: Didn’t look real. Anyway, listen, I got
to get something to eat or I’m gonna die.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. simon</strong>: Come on, let’s look for something.</p>
<p><strong>mr. simon</strong>: Did you see anyone doing anything with
corned beef?</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Your parents…</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: They’re…nice</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: They’re Okay. They just sometimes don’t have
any idea of what I’m talking about.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: I’m sure of that. Afraid you’re going to
miss your friends?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: No. I don’t have any. I think I intimidate
other kids.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Good boy.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: I don’t want to.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Remember, compared to you, most people
have the IQ of a carrot. We’re different than most people, Mitch, but
you should be proud of that. I mean, look around. From now on, you’ll BE
amongst peers, colleagues. I suppose I might as well tell you now, I’ve
put you on my personal research team. Some of the finest minds on
campus, not the least of which is, of course, my own.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: It sounds great.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Well, now, I’m expecting great things from
you, my boy. This is only the second time I’ve given this honor to a
freshman. The first was…</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Chris Kinsley.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: You know Chris?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: No, but he’s a legend in the Physics
Club.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Well, you’re going to become a legend
yourself. You’ll be working with Chris. He’s a senior now but he’s still
on the team and still as brilliant as ever.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Guys, I want you to meet Chris Kinsley.
Chris, this is Sherry Nugil, my assistant, and Mike Dodd.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Dr. Dodd?</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: He’s the man who just designed the new
Telcom Satellite here.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I know. Nice to meet you Dr. Dodd. Isn’t the
Telcom raining debris all over Europe?</p>
<p><strong>dodd</strong>: That was a launch problem, not a design
problem. Why are you wearing that toy on your head?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Oh, this. Sorry, I was worried that people
would think I was stuffy, You know, no fun; all brain, no penis,</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Pardon?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I’m sorry, it’s just an infantile response to
authority.</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Yes. you are Chris Kinsley, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: No. Well, yes. I mean, I used to be. Now I’m
Mhavishnue Kinsley.</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: I see. You are being funny.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Well, I just can’t help it. You’re such a fun
guy yourself.</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Oh yes. I think you’ll find we all are,
right Mike?</p>
<p><strong>dodd</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Now Chris, Sherry is going to show you
around the place. She can answer any questions you might have about
fringe benefits or dress codes or anything and I’ll see you back
upstairs when you’re done, okay? Sherry, take good care of this young
man. He’s one of the ten finest minds kin the country.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Someday I hope to be two of them.</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: See you later.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You are very beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>sherry</strong>: You don’t act like one of the top ten minds
in America.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Oh, really? How many of them have you
met?</p>
<p><strong>sherry</strong>: Seven.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>sherry</strong>: You’ll be eight. Six was Professor Hostetler
at M.I.T.</p>
<p><strong>sherry</strong>: He is now.</p>
<p><strong>sherry</strong>: And so, coupled with full insurance coverage
and bonus plans, you find it adding up to a fairly sizable perks
package.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I have a pretty sizable perks package right
now.</p>
<p><strong>sherry</strong>: Also, we understand that you people don’t
care too much for rigid timetables, and that’s pretty rare in private
industry.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: So are you.</p>
<p><strong>sherry</strong>: Is it true that school of yours keeps
getting smarter and smarter kids every year?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Yup! I mean no!</p>
<p><strong>sherry</strong>: You see the funding associations are the
same. Our theoretical work is in the Blue Sky sector as well.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You have no idea how much I need that kind of
continuity in my life right now.</p>
<p><strong>sherry</strong>: You just belong here, Chris. We have several
of Dr. Atherton’s former students and they’re all doing quite well with
us.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: What number was he?</p>
<p><strong>sherry</strong>: Two. One of his other students was four.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You’re wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>sherry</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Can we go somewhere?</p>
<p><strong>sherry</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ext. roof of hanger-dusk</strong>: The giant dish of a huge
radio telescope faces heavens.</p>
<p><strong>sherry</strong>: Talk smart to me.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>angle on chris and sherry</strong>: They are lying in the
middle of the dish. Passion mounts, fingers cope with belts and buttons,
clothing falls away; my god, these people are having sex.</p>
<p><strong>sherry</strong>: Please I need it. What was your favorite
course?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I guess right now I’d have to say Fluid
Mechanics.</p>
<p><strong>sherry</strong>: Oooooooooh…</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: And Gym.</p>
<p><strong>sherry</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>sherry</strong>: What’s your research with Artherton?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Ultra-high power laser as an energy force for
fusion. Tremendous boon to all mankind. And womankind, too.</p>
<p><strong>sherry</strong>: Fusion, more fusion.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: It’s the process for obtaining enormous
amounts of energy from forms of hydrogen, like Deuterium and
Tritium.</p>
<p><strong>sherry</strong>: Oh, my God, more.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Extracting the fuels is no problem.</p>
<p><strong>sherry</strong>: Hmmmm.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Getting them to combine and release the
energy is the problem.</p>
<p><strong>sherry</strong>: Oohh, yes</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: It takes temperatures of 100 million degrees
Celsius.</p>
<p><strong>sherry</strong>: Oh, God.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: So, I’m…</p>
<p><strong>sherry</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: …building…</p>
<p><strong>sherry</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: …a laser…</p>
<p><strong>sherry</strong>: Oh, yes.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: …that pulses…</p>
<p><strong>sherry</strong>: Hmmmmmmmm.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: …very hot…</p>
<p><strong>sherry</strong>: Ohhh…</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: …and causes…</p>
<p><strong>sherry</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: …Fusion…</p>
<p><strong>sherry</strong>: Ahhhhhhhhhhh.</p>
<p><strong>ext. pacific tech campus-day</strong>: It is an impressive
campus of older California Spanish building mixed with modern
architectural marvels. This is the Sunday before the beginning of the
Winter Term.</p>
<p><strong>ext. president’s house-afternoon</strong>: The tasteful and
elegant official residence of the university’s President. DR. EUGENE
MEREDITH. MITCH approaches the open front door, where he is greeted by
MRS. MEREDITH.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Good afternoon. I’m looking for the
President’s Freshman Tea.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. meredith.</strong>: Oh, good. I’m so glad we have one
then. Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>int. the house-continous</strong>: They pass through on their
way to the backyard.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Mitch Simon.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. meredith.</strong>: Oh yes. You’re the special case. I
know Gene wants to meet you. You’re just in time for his traditional
talk. Would you like a glass of sherry?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: I’m a minor.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. meredith.</strong>: Aha, well of course you are. That
would explain your height.</p>
<p><strong>ext. the patio and grounds of the house-continuous</strong>:
The returning freshman class has gathered for a social. Mitch is the
only one in a tie. He stands on the patio with Mrs. Meredith whose
husband, the apparently ever-jovial professional academic administrator,
is about to speak to the assembled.</p>
<p><strong>meredith</strong>: People, if I might get your attention.</p>
<p><strong>meredith</strong>: Welcome back, freshmen! I take it you all
put the Christmas break to good use?</p>
<p><strong>meredith</strong>: Now, if you’ll indulge me, I’d like to
speak seriously for a moment. You will recall that when I welcomed you
to the Pacific institute of Technology a few short months ago I spoke of
how we are one of the finest scientific institutions in the world. I
think the finest. I mentioned our six Nobel Prize winners, our members
of the national Academy of Sciences, and our members of the National
Academy of Engineering. This is an intellectual oasis of technological
achievement in the dessert of general academic mediocrity we see inmost
colleges and universities today.</p>
<p><strong>meredith</strong>: I also spoke of the fact that you are the
finest freshmen class we have ever had here.</p>
<p><strong>meredith</strong>: I say this to every freshman class. Each
year we raise our entrance requirements and each year there is a group
of students like you who meet and surpass those requirements.</p>
<p><strong>meredith</strong>: As you have no doubt already noticed by
now, over a third of you are gone. By the end of the year another third
of you will have followed them out of Eden and into mediocrity.</p>
<p><strong>meredith</strong>: We want only the best. Hard work and high
standards are expected of everyone. And if you aren’t up to it Cal tech
or M.I.T. might take you, but you don’t fit in here.</p>
<p><strong>meredith</strong>: Let me remind you that this place is an
opportunity, not a right; a chance not a gift; a working lunch, not a
picnic. Welcome back. Several waitresses begin serving tea but the
despair of reality creeps over the students and they begin to disperse.
Mitch stands waiting for the approaching Dr. Meredith.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. meredith</strong>: Gene, this is Mitch Simon.</p>
<p><strong>meredith</strong>: Oh, yes, Professor Artherton’s bright
star.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>meredith</strong>: And I understand you’re already on his
project. I’m assured you’re going to do great things.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: I hope so.</p>
<p><strong>meredith</strong>: Let me give you some advice.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>meredith</strong>: Don’t screw up.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Okay. I guess I better go now.</p>
<p><strong>meredith</strong>: I think the young people really appreciate
my ” getting down” verbally, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. meredith</strong>: Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>ext. campus-later</strong>: Once again Mitch, map in hand,
must ask another student for directions. This one also turns the map
right-side up and then points to the building they are standing in front
of. As he heads for it he passes a bronze bust of one of the founding
fathers, DR. BRADFORD. The students have decorated him with a muffler,
earmuffs and carrot nose to look like a snowman.</p>
<p><strong>int. applied physics building-moments later</strong>: Mitch
walks down a long corridor. He passes several open doors that reveal
laboratories with all kinds of scientific equipment all over them.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Come in here.</p>
<p><strong>int. lab-continuous</strong>: Mitch ENTERS quickly and shuts
the door behind himself. In the instrument glow we can make out the
forms of three other students. They are: KENT, CARTER and BODIE, members
of Dr. Atherton’s research team.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Just leave the sandwiches and go.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: No, Yoda; yeah, you.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: I don’t have any ah…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Brains?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: No, sandwiches.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Well then, what good are you?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: What are we supposed to eat?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: How about my shorts.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Hey! Who do you think you’re talking to?</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Are you from the restaurant or not?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: No. I’m Mitch Simon. I’m a student.
Dr. Atherton told me to come up here.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Oh, you’re the new stud, are you. Or is it
dud?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: How do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>bodie</strong>: Stud. Hot shot. Brain. You’re the
twelve-year-old, right?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: I’m fifteen.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Does your body know that?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Are you expecting him or…</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Sure. Can I get you something? A balloon?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Are any of you guys Chris Kinsley?</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: No, Thank God.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Hey Kent, I hear Kinsley got that PEI job
all locked up.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Damn! I wanted that job.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Why? Because it starts at fifty thousand a
year, that’s why. Plus travel, car, stock options…</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Oh. Well, I’m supposed to have a look at your
work up to date. Check it over.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Check it over.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Mistakes, I guess. He said you guys are
stuck.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Let’s get something very clear here.
Everything you’ve heard about the supportive student body and the honor
code might hold for the rest of the campus, but it doesn’t count for
squat in here. Which means when jerry’s not here, you do what I say.
From God to Jerry to me, get it?</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Hi Jerry.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: I’ve told you before, Kent, you don’t get
to use my first name.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Did I?</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Good to see you, Mitch.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: I’m sure you’re all going to become fast
friends.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: We’re well on our way already.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Good, because after Mitch is brought up to
date, I want the rest of you to take your cues from him. He’ll be in
charge of the group.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: What? I mean, good choice, Jerry.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: You’re doing it again, Kent.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Am I?</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Where’s Chris?</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: He didn’t bother to come in today.</p>
<p><strong>bodie</strong>: He said he didn’t feel like it; and then I
said ‘you better’; and then he said ’ or what?‘; and then I said’ or
he’d get the heck,’ and then he said ‘jam it, it’s Sunday’ and he looks
for God on Sundays; so I said ‘okay, but I’m telling.’</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Thank you Bodie. I notice you’ve stopped
stuttering.</p>
<p><strong>bodie</strong>: Yes, I’ve been giving myself some sock
treatment and it’s working.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Good. I’m sorry he isn’t here. I wanted
you to meet your hero.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Hero? That clown? Look at this.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: It looks like it’ll take at least a week to
re-do all this and start again.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Another costly mistake.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Positive.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Positive.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Negative. There’s a mistake all right, but I
think you guys made it. Look, you inverted the last two steps.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: I don’t make mistakes… …Usually.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Damnit, don’t touch other people’s
things.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: This shouldn’t take too long to fix.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: I’m glad that you were here, Mitch.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Yes, thanks for pointing out Carter’s mistake,
Mitch.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Don’t bother with that now. I’m sure you
want to go get settled.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Well, it has been kind of a long day.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Oh, I forgot Kent, I need your help.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Anything, Jerry.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Stop it.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Get copies made of everything so young
Mitch here can get started checking everything tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: My pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: And then, on your way back, stop at my
cleaners.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Don’t give it a thought. I enjoy it.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Shall we?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>bodie</strong>: I guess it goes from God to Jerry to you to
the cleaners, right Kent?</p>
<p><strong>ext. dorm hall- late afternoon</strong>: Mitch enters the
arched column portico of this dormitory building.</p>
<p><strong>int. room</strong>: The room is small, cramped, and more than
a little disheveled. PEI, NASA and science fiction posters hang on the
ceiling and wall, over and around one of the two beds. Junk food and
soft drink containers are littered everywhere. In one corner is a
fully-stocked Frito Lay Chip display.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: What kind of place is this?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Hey, you just gonna sit there admiring the
room or are you going to help me with this?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: What is this thing?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: It’s a penis stretcher. You want to try it
out?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Oh really? Well, congratulations, then, No,
It’s an Iron Mike.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: A baseball pitching machine.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: I was here for a second this morning…</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You didn’t straighten the place up, did
you?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Good. ’Cause all my filth’s in alphabetical
order.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Anyway, I dropped off my luggage and now all
my bags are empty.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I put your stuff away for you.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: It’s all in the bottom drawer. Shirts, pants,
underwear, shoes. I had a little trouble with your sport jacket, so I
threw it out. Nah, only kidding. This one’s for you, little Johnny.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: What a game. I’m Chris Kinsley.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Oh, no.</p>
<p><strong>int. moving car- same time</strong>: Dr. Atherton is riding
in a rental car with DON CARMICHAEL, a government contract monitor.
These two guys are part of an old boy network involved with research and
development.</p>
<p><strong>carmichael</strong>: We’re falling way behind, Jer.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Well, we’re not making cheese sandwiches
here, you know, Don.</p>
<p><strong>carmichael</strong>: That’s a good one. I’ll have to remember
to use that, Jer.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: The new boy is quick.</p>
<p><strong>carmichael</strong>: He better be because the company needs a
practical working model within four months.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: You can’t dictate innovation.</p>
<p><strong>carmichael</strong>: Let me put this another way, Jer. You
know all that money we’ve been spending for development?</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Yes</p>
<p><strong>carmichael</strong>: Well, when a project gets cut off, the
finance boys always run an audit.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>carmichael</strong>: Having a little work done on the old
place, are you? Looks nice.</p>
<p><strong>int. mitch’s room-that night</strong>: Mitch is gathering up
some books. He looks at a chart on the wall.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Library… library…205.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Welcome to Pacific Tech’s “Smart People On
Ice.”</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Ice turned out real good, Ick.</p>
<p><strong>ick</strong>: Yeah, it worked., didn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: What did you use?</p>
<p><strong>ick</strong>: Oh, sure, I tell you then you tell somebody
else, and the next thing you know we’re in the middle of another ice
age.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Come on, people. Nobody’s skating.</p>
<p><strong>a student</strong>: Just ’cause you’re a slack, Kinsley.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Moles and trolls.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Moles and trolls. Work, work, work, work. I
plan this for weeks. I go to a lot of trouble and all they want to do is
study. I’m hurt. I know that’s it’s not like me but I’m sorry. I’m
starting to get discouraged, people. We had nobody at the mutant hamster
races, one entry in the Madame Curie look-alike contest, and he was
disqualified later. Why do I even bother?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: How does he do it?</p>
<p><strong>ick</strong>: Well, I’m not an expert, but I think he puts
one foot in front of the other and pushes.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Not skating. The horsing around. The never
studying. I know he’s smart. but nobody’s that smart.</p>
<p><strong>ick</strong>: I don’t know how smart he is. Before he even
came here he invented a solar battery, which laid the groundwork for the
system that provides the energy for Amarillo, at half the cost. He’d be
a millionaire today if he been smart enough to make them pay for it. How
he pulls the grades, I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: No, not emotionally, no I’m not. I’m
disappointed… not terribly, but still, it should have gone much,
further, much faster. It’s okay, though, I know what the problem is,
that’s simple, it’s obviously the drag coefficient, I’ll just have to
re-design the blades. I can do that, that’s easy. I can do that here;
but I have to cut then after they’re designed, that takes tools, that
takes time. How long is this stuff going to last, do you know?</p>
<p><strong>ick</strong>: Maybe another half an hour.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: That’s great, that’s good. I can do that, no
problem, lots of time. What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Mitch</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Thanks for the help. See you.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Your welcome. Who was that?</p>
<p><strong>ick</strong>: That? that was…</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: I’m Jordan, I realized I’d forgotten to tell
you my name, it’s Jordan. I heard there was going to be someone new this
term, are you a freshman?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Do you have a bed?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Oh, I was going to make you one if you
needed it but you don’t so that’s okay. Well, I gotta go, I’ll see you
later, probably. See you Ick, see you Mitch.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: What’s all this suppose to be?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: This? This is new kind of shovel.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: This should keep you busy for awhile. This,
plus your regular class load should turn your brains to mush in a
month.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Aw! Kent, we were going to name you King of
the Winter Carnival.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Ha ha. I suppose you’re in on this, too. Did
you make this stuff?</p>
<p><strong>ick</strong>: I’m not saying.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Who’s going to clean it up?</p>
<p><strong>ick</strong>: Don’t have to. It’s going to go from solid form
directly to gas.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Really? What is it?</p>
<p><strong>ick</strong>: I’m not saying. But I can tell you that it’s
fairly rare, and very unstable.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: You’re all a bunch of degenerates.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: We are? What about that time I caught you
naked with a bowl of Jello?</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: I…you… I was hot and I was hungry. And
anyway…Look, Kinsley, you’re not number one anymore.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Number one what?</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Mighty mouse, here, beat your placement scores
by over twenty points.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Really? I guess you think you’re pretty hot
stuff?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Well…no, I mean</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Hey! Maybe you are smarter than me, but, can
you do this?</p>
<p><strong>ick</strong>: It worked!</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: That’s neat.</p>
<p><strong>ick</strong>: Now if we can just keep it from exploding.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Hey, Ick. Is it okay to breathe this stuff?
Ick? Ick?</p>
<p><strong>angle on mitch</strong>: To say the least, he’s thrown by
this strange intrusion.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>over mitch’s shoulder into closet</strong>: There’s nothing
in there but clothes. Mitch pushes the garments aside and finds just a
wall.</p>
<p><strong>angle on mitch</strong>: He shakes his head. This is getting
frustrating. He exits the room.</p>
<p><strong>int. bathroom</strong>: Mitch crosses to the urinal. Just as
he is about to relieve himself, the door opens. Jordan enters. This is
an experience Mitch has never before and as a result he is one
uncomfortable fifteen-year-old.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Hi, good morning, I thought I saw you come
in here, you must be an earlier riser, we met last night, I’m Jordan,
remember? I had a sled with me, I made you a sweater.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Last night?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: yeah, it’s just something I do with my hands
while I’m reading. I hope I got the size right, I’m pretty sure I did, I
have a brother so I use him as a sizing comparison, and I have a pretty
good eye for that sort of thing, so I just went ahead and made you one
because I was, you know, up. Peeing?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: I never sleep. I don’t know why. It drove my
roommate nuts. I mean really nuts, they had to take her away in an
ambulance and everything, she’s okay now thought but she had to be
transfer to an easier school but I don’t know if that part has anything
to do with being my fault, but still, anyway, if you ever want any help
studying at night or just let me know, okay, ’cause I’m just a couple of
doors down from you guys and I’m usually up and I wouldn’t mind,
okay?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Thanks, I will.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Are you finished yet?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: I can’t start.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Because I’m here?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: I think so.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Isn’t that weird? Well, I have to go.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Me, too.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Right, well, don’t forget what I said, I’ll
put the sweater in your room, see you later, tell Chris that if he wants
one I’ll be happy to make him one but nit today because after classes
I’m going to rebuild the back part of my room, you should come down and
see it later, I have to go, bye.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: bye.</p>
<p><strong>int. the lobby area of the dorm- a little later</strong>:
Mitch is coming down a hallway into the area. He is dressed in his tie
and jacket and has books under his arm. As he crosses past the
self-serve vending machine he spots Chris entering the kitchen. Mitch
follows him inside.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Something strange happened to me this
morning.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Was it a dream where you see yourself dressed
up in kind of sun god robes standing on top of a pyramid with all theses
nude women throwing little pickles at you?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: No</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Why am I the only person who has that
dream?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Liquid nitrogen?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Coffee?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: So, what’s happened?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Oh. There’s a guy living in our closet.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You’ve seen him too?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Hopsfield.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Is he… safe?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: So far.</p>
<p><strong>school montage:</strong>: A quick series of shots moves us
through the next two months of time, accompanied by an original
song.</p>
<p><strong>int. atom smasher room-day</strong>: Mitch stands with a
group of other students watching an instructor explain the intricacies
of nuclear fission. Mitch opens a notebook and starts writing
furiously.</p>
<p><strong>int. chris and mitch’s room-night</strong>: it is late but
Mitch is still hard at the books. Hopsfield goes by and disappears in
the closet. Mitch doesn’t even notice anymore. There is a knock at the
door and Jordan enters. She has brought Mitch a device that she just
built which holds textbooks and turns the pages automatically.</p>
<p><strong>int. lecture hall-day</strong>: Mitch, dressed more
informally, is in the same room with the same professor as in scene 54.
This time, however, there are several empty seats. The people have been
replaced by cassette tape recorders. Mitch takes notes.</p>
<p><strong>int. atherton’s lab-night</strong>: Mitch and Chris work
alone. it is obviously very late. Using a variety of exotic-looking
devices, they put the laser through its paces and make notes.</p>
<p><strong>int. wave tank room-day</strong>: A very attractive
instructress is demonstrating a dye trace experiment in a huge wave
tank. Mitch takes notes.</p>
<p><strong>int. dining hall</strong>: Mitch and Ick are carrying trays
of food, looking for a place to sit. They pass a seated Kent, who points
out a place for Mitch, who looks to see a highchair at the end of the
table.</p>
<p><strong>ext. library-morning</strong>: Mitch comes down the stairs
with several books under his arms. He stumbles and drops one of the
books. As he struggles to recover it, it is handed to him by none other
than Hopsfield. By the time Mitch realizes who it is, the mysterious
figure is once again gone.</p>
<p><strong>ext. street-day</strong>: Mitch is crossing the street
carrying a huge load of books. Suddenly a yellow Citroen pulls up behind
him and honks its horn causing Mitch to drop everything. He looks at the
driver and sees that it is a laughing Kent.</p>
<p><strong>int. atherton’s classroom</strong>: Chris, Kent, Bodie and
Carter are present as Atherton wraps up a day’s class. People take
serious notes. Chris reads a magazine. People file out and Mitch enters
approaches Chris to get him to work on the laser. Chris shakes his
head.</p>
<p><strong>int. atherton’s lab-late night</strong>: Mitch is working
alone. He adjusts the laser and turns it on. It burns through a very
thick block of wood, but Mitch is still not pleased.</p>
<p><strong>int. hallway-next morning</strong>: A very tired Mitch heads
for the lecture hall. He comes to the door, opens it and enters to see a
tape recorder lecturing to a roomful of tape recorders.</p>
<p><strong>int. chris and mitch’s room-another night</strong>: In need
of a break from studying, Mitch goes to the closet in hopes of figuring
out how to open the wall.</p>
<p><strong>int. atherton’s lab-day</strong>: There is an experiment in
progress. A large laser is building up an energy load. Atherton, Kent,
Bodie, Carter, and Mitch monitor various pieces of equipment. Things hum
and click and there is a sense that something big is going to happen.
Atherton seems pleased, while Mitch seems troubled. Suddenly, a valve
blows and a stream of liquid nitrogen hisses from a hose, spewing frost
over everything. Everyone jumps for switches and they shut the
experiment down.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: It’s nothing. It’s just mechanical.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: GOOD. Don’t bother changing it. I want you
and Bodie to rebuild the whole unit; same output in half the size.
Should hold up, right Mitch?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Sure, as long as we go with H.F.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Well, gentlemen, now what? Things are
going okay so far, aren’t they?</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: They certainly are in my area, Jerry.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Boy, when I think of all the applications for
this…!</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: We’ve got enough theory to deal with
without talking applications. You just worry about giving me that power
breakthrough. how close are you?</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Not very, from what I hear.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Aren’t you and Chris working together?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Yes…but…</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Where is Mr. Kinsley?</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: He’s outside.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Kinsley! Dr. Atherton wants you.</p>
<p><strong>ext. lab building-medium close on chris-waist up</strong>:
He’s sitting on a chaise lounge with a stack of encyclopedias, sipping a
beer.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Coming.</p>
<p><strong>angel on atherton and chris-framed by the window</strong>:
Chris hovers in mid-air.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: What are you doing out there?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Floating, sir. And thinking.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: I want to see you at my house at six
o’clock. Sharp.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Sounds fun. Should I bring anything?</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: How about a proper attitude for a
change?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I’ll try and borrow one. Now, if you’ll
excuse me, there are millions of boys and girls everywhere waiting for
me to bring them presents. Ho ho ho.</p>
<p><strong>int. lab</strong>: Atherton, Mitch and Kent stand at the
window, watching Chris ascend.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: He’s really pushing it, isn’t he, Jerry?</p>
<p><strong>angle on mitch</strong>: He smiles as he watches his roommate
and friend float off.</p>
<p><strong>ext. atherton’s house-early evening</strong>: The restoration
work is reaching completion and the house is looking pretty
beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You wanted to see me, your joggingness?</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Mr. Kinsley. Right on time. What a
surprise. Do you run?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Only when chased.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: What are you eating?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: It’s one of mark’s Ickagami’s experiments.
He’s been irradiating corn with strontium. it’s his hobby; big food.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: That’s popcorn?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: It’s big popcorn.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Get it away from me. I can’t stand it. I
hate popcorn. Leave it there. Chris puts the bag down on the porch.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Okay. Have you ever considered switching to
de-caffeinated coffee?</p>
<p><strong>int. atherton’s house- continuous</strong>: The interior is
immaculate. A classic example of elegant good taste. Atherton is
fastidiously protective of his things.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: I want to start seeing a lot more of you
in the lab.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You want me to work nude?</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Very funny, you’re a major disappointment
to me, Chris.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: And you to me, Jerry.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: We had a deal!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: And I advanced your project more than any
three guys on campus.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: That was yesterday. What have you done for
me today?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Hey, aren’t you getting a little obsessive
about this? I took in the new kid. He’s working his guts out for
you.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Your arrogant, disrespectful behavior is
distracting him. If you keep it up, you’re going to pay for it.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Hey, I’m out of here. Delenda Est Cartheo.
P.E.I. July one.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: You still have to pass, dear boy, and
considering the fact that my class is a requisite, it would seem that I
would have some control over your destiny. From now on, you and
Mr. Simon are going to spend every waking moment working on my power
problem and you will solve it by my deadline.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Okay, Jerry, but I really think you should
see an analyst.</p>
<p><strong>int. atherton’s lab-night</strong>: Mitch is alone and trying
to work on the new, smaller laser. He looks tired and upset. He tinkers
around for a while, then goes back to his table and looks at his notes.
Nothing seems to make sense anymore. Chris enters with a beaker in his
hand.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Hi. Do me a favor, taste this.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Come on, you won’t hurt my feelings.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Well, too sweet?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Beats me. I just found it in one of the
labs.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Aggghh!!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Come on. I’m just pulling your leg. How are
you doing?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: I’m stuck. Dr. Atherton says we’ve got to
miniaturize the power supply and you’re not helping.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Lighten up. It’s only a laser.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Instead of trying to take that roomful of
capacitors over there and putting new perspective. Charge this baby up.
Everything you’ve got.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You’ll see. Go</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: All set, I think.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Do it.</p>
<p><strong>chris’s pov</strong>: A roomful of capacitors loading.</p>
<p><strong>ext. the campus-night</strong>: The lights twinkle from
various buildings. WE HEAR the hum</p>
<p><strong>ext. the campus-night</strong>: The lights twinkle from
various buildings. We hear the hum growing.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: What are you doing now?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Making hamburgers.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Oh, no!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Relax, it’s just the fuses at the sub
station. They’ll have it back on in a second. More importantly, did we
get a charge?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Wow!</p>
<p><strong>ext. the campus-continuous</strong>: The beam has formed a
web of light across the darkened campus. The effect is quite
spectacular. People look in awe. Chris and Mitch exit the physics
building.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Follow the yellow brick road.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Have you ever considered the fact that you
are completely wasting your life?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Constantly.</p>
<p><strong>int. wave tank building</strong>: An open window above the
door lets the beam of light enter. Chris and Mitch enter.</p>
<p><strong>int. hallway-continuous</strong>: Chris and Mitch walk down a
stairway through an open door, following the beam.</p>
<p><strong>int. wave tank room-continuous</strong>: The place has been
turned into an indoor Waikiki. The beam has been directed into a
hood-shaped device that has split it into enough rays to cook a bunch of
hot dogs and hamburgers on an improvised barbeque, managed by ICK, who
is dressed for the beach and wearing a welding mask.</p>
<p><strong>ick</strong>: Aloha.</p>
<p><strong>angle on the doorway</strong>: A lot of the guys we’ve seen
around the dorm have started to arrive. They enter hesitantly at Chris’s
urging.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Come on in, boys. Surf’s up.</p>
<p><strong>cornell</strong>: I have a geochemistry test tomorrow and I
do not feel adequately prepared.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: But the main thing is you look good.</p>
<p><strong>cornell</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: What if we end up having too much fun and
end up failing?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: And would that be the end of the world.
Milton?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Yes, it would.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Yeah, you’re right. Maybe you should go back
to the library.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Well, maybe I could just look for a
minute.</p>
<p><strong>cornell</strong>: Are those girls?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I haven’t had them all tested yet, Cornell,
but so far so good.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Who are they?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: They’re not from here. I’d know.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: No, no they’re not, they’re from a nearby
college though.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Which one?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: The Wanda Trossler School of beauty.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: They’re beauticians?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>cornell</strong>: Gee, I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: They’ll teach you. Let’s get serious here,
lads. There are 670 guys at pacific tech and 136 girls.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: A ratio of 4.93 to 1</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Good, Milton. Of the 136 girls, most of them
can find guys a lot better than you.</p>
<p><strong>cornell</strong>: Oh, easily.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: These girls are not used to geniuses. You
might impress them.</p>
<p><strong>cornell</strong>: I don’t see how.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Let me put this another way. Given the type
of people you are and the environment you’re in, you guys have to admit
the strong probability that this may be the only chance you’ll ever get
in your entire lives to have sex.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Think about it.</p>
<p><strong>angles on various activities- a little later</strong>:
Water-skiing, dancing, a volleyball game. Most of the guys are making an
effort to socialize. Mitch watches quietly.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: So, what do you guys do? Just be smart all
the time?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: What’s your major?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Astrophysics.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Is that like sports medicine?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Space.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Oh! Let me ask you something about that. If
I was on the moon, Could I like tease hair much higher?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Theoretically.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: This is fascinating.</p>
<p><strong>connie</strong>: My friend Evelyn, tells me that brilliant
men are the best lovers.</p>
<p><strong>fenton</strong>: I’d say that’s true.</p>
<p><strong>connie</strong>: Up to now, what’s been your ultimate sexual
experience?</p>
<p><strong>fenton</strong>: I once fell off a ladder and landed on my
sister, Bernice.</p>
<p><strong>louisa</strong>: Why do you wear those glasses?</p>
<p><strong>cornell</strong>: So I can see.</p>
<p><strong>louisa</strong>: But you look very sexy without them.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: I really should be studying.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Me too. I have a bleaching final
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Achew.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Bless you.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: I’m allergic to suntan oil.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Maybe you should stop.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: I don’t think I can</p>
<p><strong>louisa</strong>: You know, I read in the Enquirer that woman
paid twenty thousand dollars for the sperm of a genius.</p>
<p><strong>cornell</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>louisa</strong>: I’ve GOT TWENTY BUCKS?</p>
<p><strong>cornell</strong>: Do you have a cup?</p>
<p><strong>angle on mitch</strong>: The party is in full swing and most
of the guys have become very comfortable. Some are making out. Mitch now
seems like the only one left out. he sees a pretty GIRL just coming out
of the water. She adjusts her top. Mitch wanders over to her.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: I was watching you…swim.</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: I was thinking of maybe going for a swim
myself.</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: Yeah? Is this the kiddy pool?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Don’t eat that!</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Don’t you know eating that stuff can give you
very large breasts? Oh. My god! I see I’m too late.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Christ, Don. I’m doing the best I can. You
act like I don’t want my own invention to work. There are only so many
hours in a day.</p>
<p><strong>carmichael</strong>: I agree. And what’s more important,
massaging your ego on television explaining the digestive system of a
rabbit to the great unwashed or “project crossbow”</p>
<p><strong>makeupman</strong>: Off-hand, I’d say television.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Just get rid of the crows’ feet! There’s
nothing more important than ” crossbow,” but when went from blue sky to
black you turned into Bigfoot.</p>
<p><strong>stage manager</strong>: Ready to go, Dr. Atherton.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Pushing me doesn’t help. You tell them
that.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>carmichael</strong>: Asshole.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: I have something to…</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Did you pick up my dry cleaning?</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Yes I did… there’s something you should
know.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: The gravy stain?</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: No, that came out. Chris and Mitch aren’t
working. They’re at a party.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: I want to show me where, right after I’m
finished here.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: My pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>stage manager</strong>: In five…four…</p>
<p><strong>stage manager</strong>: …three…two…and…</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: WELCOME TO “SCIENCE,” WITH YOUR HOST,
Dr. JEROME ATHERTON. FUNDED BY…</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: … A grant from Pacific Electric
Instruments. PEI. And now, Dr. Atherton.</p>
<p><strong>angle on atherton in the studio</strong>: He smiles broadly
and reads from the cue cards.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Good evening. Tonight we’re going to look
at something most of us take for granted… the colon. What’s it look
like?</p>
<p><strong>angle on jordan</strong>: She tosses a volleyball up into the
air in a one-woman game of catch. Mitch approaches forlornly.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Wanna play?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: I’m not very…</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Sure, all right.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Some party, huh?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: I guess. How come you’re not…</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Necking?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: well…</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: I’m not gay.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: I didn’t… I wouldn’t even…</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Look, I’m seventeen. I’m brilliant, and I’m
hyper kinetic. Guy are a little afraid of me, you know. It’ll pass…I
hope.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: I think you’re very nice.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Simon!</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: You were supposed to be in the lab
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Weren’t you!</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: I was and…</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: You are at Pacific Tech to work, not to
behave like a philistine.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: That’s right!</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: I was working, I…</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Where’s Kinsley. I imagine this was his
idea.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: No doubt!</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Kent!</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: yes?</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: I took a big chance recommending a
fifteen-year-old. I guess I made a mistake. I hope you’re proud of
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>cornell</strong>: Dr. Atherton?</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: What!</p>
<p><strong>cornell</strong>: Are you wearing makeup?</p>
<p><strong>louisa</strong>: Is it too try and hide those crows’
feet?</p>
<p><strong>angle on mitch</strong>: He is truly at a loss in the face of
this cruelty. Everyone is staring at him. He runs out the door.</p>
<p><strong>angle on jordan</strong>: She watches Mitch go, feeling very
badly for him</p>
<p><strong>int. atherton’s lab-the next night</strong>: Mitch, tired,
looking like a kid who’s been working for hours, is staring at a formula
on the blackboard. Frustrated, he throws his screwdriver against it in
anger and runs into the adjacent room and begins disconnecting the
capacitor bank.</p>
<p><strong>int. lab hallway-early morning</strong>: Kent, Bodie and
Carter cross toward the lab. Just then, Mitch comes out. He looks
exhausted and very upset. As he passes Kent, he turns away from his
stare.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Gee, he looks depressed.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: I’d like to make a collect call to Mrs. Bill
Simon.</p>
<p><strong>int. atherton’s office</strong>: Mitch is on the phone. He’s
very upset.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: I know, but I don’t like it here anymore. I
want to live at home with you… Yeah, and dad. I want to go back to high
school. I-dad did what? Rented out my room? …Well, why can’t
Mr. Echevarria and I share it?… Please, ma, I want to come home.</p>
<p><strong>int. kent’s lab-tight on a mini tape recorder</strong>: Its
reels are spinning. It’s being held up to a telephone receiver.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Please let me come home. I don’t want to stay
here.</p>
<p><strong>int. dorm hall-dining room-next morning</strong>: The dorm
population is eating their breakfast. Kent and his unholy two are smugly
downing their “shredded wheat” Mitch is alone off in the corner. It’s
obvious he hasn’t slept.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Kent…let’s never fight like that again.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: We’ve been lovers too long to have a silly
argument come between us.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Chris…</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Please. Don’t speak. You were right. Tonight
I’ll wear the cowboy suit.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: You…</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Do your parents know about this?</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Of course not!</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Nobody knows. I mean, there’s nothing to
know.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: Chris walks over to Mitch.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Where were you all last night?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: The lab. Where you were supposed to be.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Jordan told me about Atherton coming down on
you…what exactly did…</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: …Let me hold that thought and get back to
ya.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: Ken, Bodie and Carter. The gentle
strains of classical music fill the room.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Something soothing to eat by.</p>
<p><strong>angle on mitch</strong>: He can’t believe his ears. His
expression runs from surprise to embarrassment.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: Everyone stops eating and listens to
Mitch begging his mother to come home. They share his embarrassment and
lower their heads. Even Kent’s friends are uncomfortable. Kent, on the
other hand, is laughing it up, having a great time.</p>
<p><strong>angle on mitch</strong>: He’s in a state of shock.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Here comes the crying!</p>
<p><strong>angle on mitch</strong>: He runs out of the dinning room.
Kent loves Mitch reaction. It makes him laugh harder.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Too low.</p>
<p><strong>int. mitch’s room-a few minutes later</strong>: Mitch is
trying to pack, but it’s difficult because the place is in such
disarray. Chris enters. He watches and tries to think of what to
say.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Okay, if you want to leave, go ahead. But
you’ll miss the fun.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: What fun?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Ick invented a new virus and we’re gonna
release it in Kent’s room.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: That’s sick! That’s a sick thing to do!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Hey, I was just kidding, I…</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: You’re always just kidding. There’s something
wrong with you.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Just a second…</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: The other night I needed your help and all
you wanted to do was party.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I tried to help you. I tried to help you
relax.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Being snubbed by beauticians isn’t my idea of
relaxing.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Student beauticians.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: I thought this place was going to be
different, but it’s just the same. I’m either used or made fun of. In
high school they pushed me in a mailbox, did I tell you that?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: They called me Chris the whiss’…</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Really? What’s a whiss?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I think they meant wuss, but it didn’t
rhyme…when I was three years old, I balanced my father’s checkbook so
they sent me to school and fired their accountant. My father was so
intimidated, he stopped speaking to me. My teacher disliked me because I
was smarter than they were, and my classmates hated me because I bell
the bell curve. Sound familiar? And tell me why my…why did my mother
dress me in white shirts, hush puppies and a briefcase, guaranteeing
that a girl would never talk to me?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: And then one night, in this room, I was
sitting right where you are sitting now. I had a vision. I saw him.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: god</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Hopsfield.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Hopsfield? Oh! The guy in the closet.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Yeah. Laslo Hopsfield. I followed him.
Through the closet; down into the steam tunnels. And down there I saw
the most disgusting thing I�ve ever seen.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Hopsfield in his pajamas.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: And I talk to the guy . Turned out that in
the Seventies he was the number one stud around here. Smarter than you
and me put together. So brilliant, so sharp, so advanced, so long.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: He graduated. Went to work for some chemical
company. One day someone told him he was making stuff that was killing
people. I think it was his mother. He freaked. You see, he was totally
unprepared for the real world. He had no philosophy. He thought science
was the answer for everything.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Yes, you are, Metaphorically speaking. Unless
you see that the same thing that has made your life miserable can make
it great; your brain. When you’re smart, people need you, and you can
learn how to work that for fun and profit.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: You had a arrangement going with Atherton,
don’t you? That’s why you don’t have to study.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Hey, I don’t carry a briefcase. You’re a nice
kid. If you leave I’ll miss you.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: If I stay, what should I do, I mean…</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Well, the first thing you have to do is get
even with Kent. It’s a moral imperative.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>ext. campus-night</strong>: Kent’s Citroen pulls up. Kent and
Carter get out and walk by Jordan, who is sitting nearby.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: And at Northern Electronics you get the stock
options, but not the free housing, It’s what makes PEI so sweet. You get
everything.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Yeah, and Kinsley’s got that locked.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Maybe he does, and maybe he doesn’t. They walk
away.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Over here!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: He puts his name on his car. He does the same
thing with his underwear.</p>
<p><strong>montage</strong>: Chris, Mitch, Jordan and Ick working on
Kent’s car. They are undoing bolts, talking out wires, removing fenders,
etc. The last DISSOLVE and we see the car is gone. And no sign of our
foursome.</p>
<p><strong>ext. dorm hall-night</strong>: Chris quietly goes up the
stairs inside the dorm carrying a steering wheel. Ick and Mitch have an
engine on a flatbed cart. Jordan enters carrying heavy chains and a
drill.</p>
<p><strong>ext. kent’s room-early morning</strong>: Filthy with
crankcase oil, Chris, Mitch, Ick and Jordan exit and scamper down the
hall. All are very pleased with themselves.</p>
<p><strong>ext. kent’s room-later that morning</strong>: Kent is coming
down the hall. he opens his door and walks inside.</p>
<p><strong>int. kent”s room</strong>: CLOSEUP ON KENT. His jaw drops
open.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: Chris and Mitch enter.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Hey, Kent. That’s your car.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: You’re not supposed to park on campus.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: This isn’t funny. You went too far this time,
Kinsley.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I had help.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: You? I’m going to get you guys. Dr. Atherton’s
gonna hear about this.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Hey, Kent, you owe us ten dollars for the
gas. He’ll never pay us.</p>
<p><strong>ext. atherton’s house-dusk</strong>: The restoration has been
completed and the house looks beautiful. Chris comes up the walk, goes
to the door and rings the bell. A very pretty girl named SUSAN answers
the door.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Wow! Hello.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Jerry asked me to drop by. What did he ask
you to do?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Which word didn’t you understand?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Are you here for the meeting?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: What meeting?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I’m just waiting.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: And finally, it comes down to, if you can’t
do it, we’ll get somebody else. I have a timetable, doctor.</p>
<p><strong>carmichael</strong>: We’re very close, Dave, don’t worry,
everything’s going to be fine.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Don, try and remember you work for me. I
think I’ve made my point, haven’t I?</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Crystal clear, Mr. Decker.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Anything I should know about?</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Shut up Kinsley. I’ll be with you in a
moment.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Goodbye, Jerry, and good luck. Susan?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I guess this is goodbye. I’m sorry I didn’t
get a chance to know you. At all. Have you ever seen breasts like theses
before?</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: She happens to be my daughter.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Oh, then I guess you have.</p>
<p><strong>carmichael</strong>: I’ll be reporting to him every day.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Coming, Don?</p>
<p><strong>carmichael</strong>: Yes, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: What do you think you’re doing?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You said come over.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Take off those shoes.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Stay off the rugs.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: What’s up, Doc.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: I’m withdrawing your recommendation to
PEI.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: I’m giving Kent the job.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Did you suddenly find humor?</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: You haven’t solved my power problem.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I’m trying.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: No, you’re not. So, I’m going to fail you,
so you won’t graduate, so you can’t take the job. Q.E.D.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I’ll pass your exam.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: We had a deal!</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Did we? That doesn’t sound very
ethical.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You can’t do this. I’ll go to
Dr. Meredith.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Go ahead. What are you going to tell him.
Don’t forget, like most scientists, he is an honorable, moral man who
thinks everyone else is too. I’ll just deny anything you say.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You dick!</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Count on it.</p>
<p><strong>ext. dorm roof-night</strong>: Chris sits, lost in thought,
outside the window of his room, Mitch appears at the window, sees Chris
and climbs out to join him.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Self-realization. I was thinking of jumping,
but it’s only twelve feet.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Something wrong?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: No. Atherton is going to flunk me out of
school.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: But you had a deal.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Yeah, and he says I didn’t deliver. You sleep
with pits, you wake up smelly. I think Aristotle said that. It was him
or Eva Gabor. At least Hopsfield still has his integrity.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I thought I was so smart. I didn’t want to be
like the other dumb geniuses like Hopsfield. I though I could use Them.,
instead of Them using me. But, Guess what?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: I have to agree. It does appear that you’ve
been the victim of your own erroneous logic.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: However, this doesn’t mean that you can’t get
yourself out.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Hard work?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: But that’s the old way.</p>
<p><strong>grinding montage</strong>: A series of shots showing Chris
hard at work, underscored by an original song.</p>
<p><strong>int. laser lab</strong>: Mitch and Chris dismantle part of
the laser.</p>
<p><strong>int. dining hall</strong>: Mitch, Jordan and Ick are
listening as Chris shows them diagrams and formulas for a laser
supercharger while they try to eat.</p>
<p><strong>int. biochemistry lab</strong>: Chris and Ick search for a
new gas combination for the laser supercharger.</p>
<p><strong>int. atherton’s lab</strong>: Mitch and Chris work hard on a
second laser. Kent is both upset and suspicious of Chris’ new interest
in work.</p>
<p><strong>int. atherton’s classroom</strong>: Chris enters carrying
books and a note pad. Kent sees this and is shocked. Atherton gives
Chris a “you haven’t got a chance” grin.</p>
<p><strong>int. chris and mitch’s room-night</strong>: They both study
for exams; on the wall is a chart of exam week showing Mitch’s exam
schedule, a big red square around Chris’ exam with Atherton and, in
every free hour is written ” Laser”.</p>
<p><strong>int. dorm library</strong>: Many students, including our
gang, study for exams. Suddenly, Milton can’t take the pressure any
longer and momentarily goes out of his mind and runs from the room.</p>
<p><strong>int. atherton’s lab</strong>: A tired looking Chris and Mitch
attach a second laser to the original but nothing improves. They check
their notes and diagrams. Kent, Bodie and carter chuckle in the
corner.</p>
<p><strong>int. an exam room</strong>: Mitch is taking an exam with a
bunch of people he doesn’t recognize from the Professor who everyone
tape recorded. One of the students appears to be near panic as he deals
with a pile of mangled tape.</p>
<p><strong>int. jordan’s room-very late night</strong>: Chris and Jordan
use a blackboard diagram to discuss the engineering difficulties of
Chris’ laser supercharger assembly.</p>
<p><strong>int. dorm hall</strong>: Chris runs down the hall and enters
his room. Mitch is sprawled out asleep under a math text. Chris feels
bad about it but wakes him up.</p>
<p><strong>int. atherton’s lab</strong>: A wasted Chris and Mitch build
the new assembly that will allow a second laser to shoot at the gas jets
of the principal laser.</p>
<p><strong>int. dorm library-night</strong>: Chris is studying hard.
Mitch is asleep, his head on the table.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Please, Vito, not in the mailbox again.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Mitch!</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Oh… I was just reliving some high school
highlights.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Look, you don’t have to stay up with me. It’s
not like we’re driving. Get some sleep. You’re a growing boy. I
hope.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Hi, Laslo.</p>
<p><strong>hopsfield</strong>: I thought you might want some help so I
dug into the computer and got every question Artherton’s ever asked on
every final he ever given.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Gee, I didn’t get you anything. Is that
them?</p>
<p><strong>hopsfield</strong>: No, these are entries for McDonald’s
Sweepstakes. No purchase necessary. Enter as often as you want. So, I
am.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>hopsfield</strong>: This box makes it one million, six
hundred thousand. I should win thirty two point six percent of the
prizes, including the car.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Kind of takes the fun out of it, doesn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>hopsfield</strong>: I suppose so. But they set up the rules,
and lately, I have come to realize that I have certain materialistic
needs.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: So where are the questions?</p>
<p><strong>hopsfield</strong>: I memorized them.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: I have to go to sleep now.</p>
<p><strong>hopsfield</strong>: Want my pajamas?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Uhhh…thanks, no.</p>
<p><strong>hopsfield</strong>: Smart kid. He’s going to grow five inches
in the next year.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: How do you…never mind.</p>
<p><strong>int. mitch’s room</strong>: He opens the door and enters.
It’s dark.</p>
<p><strong>female voice</strong>: Mitch?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Jordan?</p>
<p><strong>sherry</strong>: Mitch Simon?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>sherry</strong>: I’m Sherry Nugil. And I’ve been waiting
three years for this.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>sherry</strong>: For you to be old enough.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>sherry</strong>: For this.</p>
<p><strong>sherry</strong>: Are you ready?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>sherry</strong>: Why do you keep saying, ‘For what?’</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: ’Cause so far it’s working great.</p>
<p><strong>int. jordan room-night</strong>: Jordan is using a big
machine to sand her floors. There’s a knock on the door.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Oh, hi, Mitch. I’m just sanding the
floor.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Could you turn that off a second?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: What’s wrong? Why are you sweating?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: I…I just…I came back from helping Chris and
there was this woman in my room.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: A woman?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: A woman. I mean she was…blessed</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Oh?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: And she wanted to…How can I say this so as
not to offend you?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Jump you?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Yeah. I hope you’re not offended.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: So what happened?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: She kissed me. Then she took off her clothes.
Then I took off my clothes-she had to help me. I kept blacking out -
then… it was unbelievable.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: You made it with her?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: No. That’s what was unbelievable.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: It’s true. I stopped her and told her I
didn’t want to.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Afraid?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: No…I mean I really did want to … but not with
her.</p>
<p><strong>int. atherton’s lab-day</strong>: Chris puts the finishing
touches on the second laser assembly. He seems pretty pleased with
himself. Kent, Bodie and Carter watch conspiratorially. Carter looks at
his watch and starts for the door.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Let’s go girls</p>
<p><strong>bodie</strong>: What’s that supposed to mean?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: It’s just a f..f..figure of speech, Bodie.
You guys coming to the exam or not?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I guess we should, seeing as he’s gone to all
the bother of having one and everything.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: You guys go ahead. I have to go to the
bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Okay, Kent, but I don’t think that’s going to
help your confidence, do you?</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: So, Mr. Funny Man, let’s see how funny you
think this is.</p>
<p><strong>int. atherton’s classroom-day</strong>: Students wait to
begin taking their final exams. Chris, Bodie and Carter enter and take
their seats. Atherton is passing out the booklets.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: You will have exactly three hours. And
remember, we believe in the honor system here, people.</p>
<p><strong>angle on kent</strong>: He enters and heads for his seat
beside Chris.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Good luck, buddy boy.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Is it okay if I name my first child after
you? Dipshit Kinsley has a nice ring to it.</p>
<p><strong>int. atherton’s classroom-later</strong>: The students are
busy taking the test.</p>
<p><strong>angle on chris</strong>: He seems to be breezing through
it.</p>
<p><strong>angle on kent</strong>: He’s taking the test. He looks up and
is distressed at Chris apparent lack of trouble. Chris looks over and
throws Kent a big kiss. Kent turns away immediately.</p>
<p><strong>int. atherton’s office</strong>: Atherton is going over some
plans. Carmichael ENTERS. Atherton rises.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: This is my class hour!</p>
<p><strong>carmichael</strong>: We’re past the deadline. Don’t you
understand, Decker’s dangerous. We need those plans.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: It’s not ready yet. But it will be. I’ve
got Kinsley cooking now. He’ll do it. Believe me, I know how to push
that kid’s buttons. Here are my drawings for the optics in the sighting
system.</p>
<p><strong>carmichael</strong>: Decker wants the laser by the end of the
week.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: I’m doing all I can, damnit!</p>
<p><strong>int. classroom</strong>: Atherton enters like a dark cloud.
He sits at his desk.</p>
<p><strong>angle on chris</strong>: He finishes his last question. He
gets out of his seat.</p>
<p><strong>angle on atherton</strong>: Sitting at his desk. Chris places
his test on the desk. Atherton looks up.</p>
<p><strong>angle on chris and atherton</strong>: Chris has a big grin on
his face. He takes a piece of paper and writes on it and then slides it
in front of Atherton.</p>
<p><strong>insert</strong>: The piece of paper. It says, “I aced
this.”</p>
<p><strong>angle on atherton</strong>: He writes a message and slides it
to Chris.</p>
<p><strong>insert</strong>: A piece of paper which reads, “Ace the
laser.”</p>
<p><strong>angle on chris</strong>: Chris places an apple on Atherton’s
desk. He exits. Atherton tosses the apple in the wastebasket. The APPLE
EXPLODES.</p>
<p><strong>ext. campus-day</strong>: Chris is heading for the lab. The
place has that look of exam period desertion.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Okie-dokie, doc, a house doesn’t have to fall
on ole Chris Kinsley.</p>
<p><strong>int. antherton’s lab-day</strong>: Chris enters and prepares
to test the new equipment. He aligns the secondary laser and let it
charge up. He makes some final checks and then throws a switch. The
laser fires for an instant but then seems to go crazy. The new laser
overheats and the main chamber sparks and smokes. Chris tries to shut it
down but to now avail. he tears the cover off in hopes of pulling the
wiring, but he’s too late. We see everything melting away as the machine
eats itself. We also see a message left for Chris just before it too
melts. It reads: “1 laser=1car.” Chris is on the verge of a complete
mental collapse as he watches his work go up in smoke.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: No!!!!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You bastard. This is your fault.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Shit! I deserve that. It all comes back on
you in the end.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Holy shit!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Of course, it’s so simple. Echoes, bouncing
back at me and you.</p>
<p><strong>ext. dorm-a little later</strong>: Chris runs up the stairs
three at a time.</p>
<p><strong>int. chris and mitch’s room</strong>: He bursts in.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Mitch?!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Laslo! Buddy! Have you seen Mitch?</p>
<p><strong>hopsfield</strong>: No. How did you do?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I failed!</p>
<p><strong>hopsfield</strong>: You shouldn’t have.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: That’s true. But never mind that now. It came
to me. The power problem. I solved it. Echoes! It’s so simple, four
little mirrors. It bounces back and supercharges the gas itself. I’ve
got to find Mitch to help me build it but it should increase the power
ten-fold at least. If you see him, tell him to meet me at the lab.
Bye.</p>
<p><strong>ext. student union-moments later</strong>: A hand-painted
sign hangs over the door that says: “Exam Week Decompression Here.”
Chris runs in the door.</p>
<p><strong>int. decompression room-continuous</strong>: The room is full
of students who are blowing off steam from studying for and taking
exams. They are engaged in all sorts of silly, mindless activities,
ranging from tiddly-winks and video games to watching cartoons. There
are supplies of “brain food” and health drinks around. Mitch, Ick and
Jordan are in the corner. Chris runs up to them.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Oh, Chris. How did it go?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Great. It was a snap. But Atherton said he’s
failing me anyway.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: That’s terrible. You must be feeling awful.
Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Thank you, Jordan. I do feel terrible but I
can’t talk about it right now. I need Mitch. Gotta go. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>ick</strong>: He seems to be handling it all right.</p>
<p><strong>ext. atherton’s house-later that night</strong>: Chris knocks
on the front door. Atherton answers the door. He is less than thrilled
to see Chris.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Hiya, Jerry, how’s it going?</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: What do you want Kinsley?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: World peace, but I don’t think this is the
time to discuss it.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: What are you doing here? I’ve already told
you you’ve burned out and you’ve failed me and yourself miserably.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Yes, I know that. But I thought you might be
interested.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: I’m not interested in anything you have to
say.</p>
<p><strong>coed</strong>: Jerry?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I solved the power problem, Jerry.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Debbie, go home.</p>
<p><strong>int. atherton’s lab-later that night</strong>: Atherton,
Kent, Bodie and Carter stand by the laser as Chris explains what he’s
done with formulas on the blackboard.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: As you know, I was working on supercharging
the DF by means of a fusion technique using a secondary laser. Well,
when I tried it, I discovered Kent had sabotaged it so it collapsed on
itself.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: And I want to thank him for the thought.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: What????</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: The Deuterium and Fluorine take up enough
space by themselves, right? Well, the mistake we’ve been making up to
now is in trying to kick up the power by means of yet another outside
source. Big and bulky, right? Well, the elegance of this is that by
reflecting part of the lasing light back in the gas jets we supercharge
the whole deal, increasing the power tenfold with no increase in
size.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: This is a complete waste of time.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Kent, make yourself useful for once and help
put those plates against the wall.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Okay, Mitch do it. This should work.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Now we open the vacuum chamber.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: So far so good. And now, cross your
fingers.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Sorry about the wall, sir.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: And the tree across the quad.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Screw the wall, you did it! You really did
it.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: I’ve done my part, too.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Okay, Kinsley. You did it. You pass.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Thank you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: And I think we can get that job back for
you at PEI.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: What! You can’t. That’s my job. I’ve done
everything you’ve ever asked. I get your laundry, and I finished the
mirror. Look.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: See! Do you have any idea how hard it is to
make a film virtually 100 per cent reflective, one micron thick and
apply it to a mirror this shape?</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Good, Kent. I have to go. I have a
pressing…</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Let’s celebrate.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Absolutely. Kent, you with us?</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Oh…eat me.</p>
<p><strong>ext. campus-night</strong>: Chris, Mitch, Ick and Jordan are
looking at the laser hole in the tree.</p>
<p><strong>ext. library-night</strong>: They look at where the beam has
cut a hole through the head of the statue of Dr. Bradford.</p>
<p><strong>ext. street-night</strong>: They look high up at a hole where
the beam went through a telephone pole and then across the street, even
higher, where it burned through a billboard on top of tavern. They
cheer.</p>
<p><strong>int. bar-later</strong>: Our group is celebrating. The
jukebox blares. Chris and Ick are drinking beers; Mitch and Jordan are
holding hands, sharing a milkshake and feeding each other French
fries.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: I don’t think I’m ready for that yet. Maybe
we should wait a year; at least until I get my license.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: I understand. There are a lot of things to
be considered here. For example, I could drive.</p>
<p><strong>hopsfield</strong>: I’ve been thinking about your laser
solution. I figure you’ve increased the output to six megawatts.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>hopsfield</strong>: What would you use that for?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: The applications are unlimited. Industrial
for one.</p>
<p><strong>hopsfield</strong>: With the gas tanks you’ve designed the
beam would only last for forty seconds. What good is that?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I don’t care, Laslo. I graduated.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Let the engineers figure out a use for it.
That’s not our concern.</p>
<p><strong>hopsfield</strong>: Maybe somebody already has a use for it,
one for which it’s perfectly designed.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: You mean Atherton had something in mind all
along?</p>
<p><strong>hopsfield</strong>: Looks at the facts: very high power,
portable, limited firing time, unlimited range. All you’d need is a big
spinning mirror and you could vaporize a human target from space.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: This is not good.</p>
<p><strong>ick</strong>: You want another beer?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: How big a mirror?</p>
<p><strong>int. hallway-early morning</strong>: Chris, Mitch, Ick,
Jordan and Hopsfield run down the hall and enter the lab.</p>
<p><strong>angle- the lab</strong>: The laser is gone.</p>
<p><strong>int. hallway</strong>: Chris runs next door and forces Kent’s
lab door open, looks in.</p>
<p><strong>int. kent’s lab</strong>: They all enter.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: The mirror is gone, too. Atherton, you worm!
You pig! You fuck! Kent, you too!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I should have seen it! How could I have not
seen it!</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: He lied to us.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: It’s easy to lie to you. You trust people!
I’m cynic! What an asshole I am!</p>
<p><strong>hopsfield</strong>: I understand how you feel, Chris, and
you’re right. But what we should be doing now is trying to find out what
he’s doing.</p>
<p><strong>int. chris and mitch’s room-night</strong>: Chris and Mitch
sit waiting. Chris is very despondent. Very. Jordan enters.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Did you do it?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: I put a receiver in it too. Is he okay?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: I don’t know he stopped talking about an hour
ago. May I see it?</p>
<p><strong>ick</strong>: Ready?</p>
<p><strong>int. dorm hallway -moments later</strong>: Mitch, Jordan and
Ick are gathered around the closed door to Kent’s room wearing the gas
masks. Ick feeds the end of the tube under the door and opens the valve
on the bottle.</p>
<p><strong>ick</strong>: We’ll have two minutes.</p>
<p><strong>student</strong>: Hi, guys.</p>
<p><strong>int. kent’s room</strong>: The gas has knocked Kent out. He
sleeps peacefully in a chair. The door opens and our gang enters.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Open his mouth.</p>
<p><strong>ick</strong>: It’s about time someone put it to good use.</p>
<p><strong>int. chris and mitch’s room-moments later</strong>: They all
huddle around a homemade radio transceiver.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Kent. Kent. Wake up, Kent.</p>
<p><strong>int. kent’s room-same time</strong>: Kent begins to stir. We
can HEAR Mitch’s voice coming from Kent’s head. At first he thinks he’s
dreaming.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: I’m talking to you, Kent.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: I said I’m talking to you.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: I’m not asleep. I must be overworked.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: You’re not overworked, Kent.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Well, I’m not insane!</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Am I?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: That remains to be seen, Kent. But we are
having a conversation.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: I have to metabolize this. Um… who is
this?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: This is Jesus, Kent, and you’ve been a very
naughty boy.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: All right! Who is this?! Bodie? Carter?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: I am known by many names. I am the One. Turn
to me and be saved.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Oh, Sure.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Cut the crap, Kent, you’ve built a
weapon.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: How did you know that?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: I know everything.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Oh. God.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: That’s right, Kent. Where is the laser
now?</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: I can’t tell you.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: How would you like to burn for the rest of
time?</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: No, they’re testing it on the twenty-seventh
but I don’t know where. It’s classified.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Nothing. I want you to think about what
you’ve done and repent, and from now on, stop playing with yourself.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: I don’t…okay</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Now what?</p>
<p><strong>hopsfield</strong>: Phase two.</p>
<p><strong>int. steam tunnels</strong>: They are near Hopsfield’s lair.
Hopsfield has removed the cover from an enormous terminal. Chris seems
remote and depressed.</p>
<p><strong>hopsfield</strong>: This is the phone terminal for the entire
school.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Okay, we tap Atherton’s office phone. What
about his home?</p>
<p><strong>ick</strong>: All the faculty’s home phone are part of the
University system.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Great, all we have to do is find it!</p>
<p><strong>hopsfield</strong>: We’ll find it.</p>
<p><strong>ick</strong>: I’m depressed. Why did I listen to my parents?
I should have become a ping-pong pro.</p>
<p><strong>hopsfield</strong>: It’s not too late.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: You shouldn’t be depressed. It’s us he
used.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Downtown Schmidlap.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Ernie “Downtown” Schmidlap. From my high
school. He was captain of everything. One day he told me he wanted to
“date me up.” so for a month he’d come over and I’d do his homework for
him. He was going to take me to the prom. But once he passed his
courses, he took Roberta Preen. I stayed home and re-wired our
housekeeper’s TV.</p>
<p><strong>ick</strong>: That’s awful!</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: You think that hurts? You should’ve met my
Uncle Stan. He was a Weasel.</p>
<p><strong>ick</strong>: That bad, huh?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: No, that was his lodge. The Royal order of
Friendly Weasels. Every Wednesday when I was eight, he’d take me down to
his lodge meeting and he’d challenge people to call out two five-digit
numbers. I had to multiply them in my head faster than a guy could do it
on a calculator. They’d bet on me. Of course, after the meeting, he’d
take me for ice cream.</p>
<p><strong>ick</strong>: That’s nice.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Well…he’d take me to the supermarket and I
had to dip my hand in.</p>
<p><strong>hopsfield</strong>: I’ve got his office.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: I’ve got his home.</p>
<p><strong>int. steam tunnel- sometime later</strong>: They’ve all made
themselves comfortable as they sit and wait for the phone tap to produce
results. Hopsfield has wired a speaker so that they can hear,</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Why doesn’t your phone ring, you jogging,
syphilitic microbe?</p>
<p><strong>ick</strong>: I think he’s coming around.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Hello</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Is this Jerome Atherton?</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Yes, it is.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: This is Bill Carlisle. I saw your television
show the other night about the reproductive system.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Thank you, I hope you enjoyed it.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I love it. Everything you said was copied
word for word from my book and I expect a lot of money for it.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Need I remind you, it’s public television,
an attempt to teach people something. And all you can think of is
personal greed. It’s people like you that make me feel bad about being
American.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I’m Canadian</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: I’m not surprised. Good day.</p>
<p><strong>ick</strong>: God, he’s good at that. He almost gets away
with it. That’s the most manipulative guy I’ve ever seen… I mean
heard.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: He does get away with it.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Not anymore.</p>
<p><strong>int. steam tunnel-later still</strong>: Everyone lies asleep
in various places and positions, Mitch awakens. He is amazed to find
Jordan asleep on his shoulder, so amazed he has to wake her.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Jordan?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Hmmmmmmmm.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: You were sleeping.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: I was? Gee I guess you relax me.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Wow!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: I put Jordan to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: And you’re proud of that?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Yes…hello</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Jer? Dave Decker How are you?</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Christ, Dave what time is it?</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Nine thirty here in Washington. I thought
you Californians all get up early and exercise. Ha, ha</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: This is it. That’s the guy I saw at his house
with the daughter.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Very funny, Dave. What do you want? I’m
busy.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: It sounds like it. Listen, I’ll be out there
tomorrow for the test but I want you to go to the Marsh this afternoon
and check optics systems one more time.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Because I’m in charge, Doctor. Goodbye. He
hangs up. All look to Chris.</p>
<p><strong>ick</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: It’s happening.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: It’s only weapon if it works, right?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You’re absolutely right! The time has come,
people. No more being used. No more Downtown Schmidlaps or Uncle Stans
or Jerry Athertons. We’re going to take responsibility for our own
brains. Remember, without ethics there can be no morality. Without
morality there is no society and without society there can be no fast
food restaurants. So the whole country, nay, in the world, is counting
on us to get even in a big way. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>ick</strong>: Nice logic.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Thanks. Synchronize watches.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: It’s just something you say at a time like
this.</p>
<p><strong>hopsfield</strong>: I don’t need a watch.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Okay, forget it. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>ext. atherton’s house-day</strong>: Atherton comes out and
heads for his car carrying an over-night bag. As he drives away we SEE
that Ick has been spying on him.</p>
<p><strong>ext. a filed-day</strong>: Ick is hiding behind some bushes
on a knoll. he is looking through binoculars.</p>
<p><strong>ick pov</strong>: Atherton’s car is passing through a high
security gate into Marsh field.</p>
<p><strong>ext. shipping dock-day</strong>: Chris, Mitch and Hopsfield
are loading the last of several large boxes into a beat-up van.</p>
<p><strong>ext. atherton’s house-evening</strong>: The van pulls up in
front. Painted on the side is a plumber’s logo. Mitch, Jordan and Ick
start unloading boxes. Chris goes to the front door.</p>
<p><strong>angle on the door.</strong>: Chris picks the lock.</p>
<p><strong>int. hopsfield’s lair-later that night</strong>: Chris and
Mitch enter to see Hopsfield as he works at the computer, attempting to
interface with another computer. Each time he hits the keys the READOUT
replies “Negative.”</p>
<p><strong>hopsfield</strong>: Boy, these secret fields are so
untrusting.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: So we can’t get on-base clearance.</p>
<p><strong>hopsfield</strong>: I guess not.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Forget it. We’ll balls it.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: How do these look?</p>
<p><strong>insert</strong>: Two fake I. D.’s with Mitch’s and Chris’s
picture on them. Perfect. I hope.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: What if they don’t fool anybody?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: They shoot us.</p>
<p><strong>ext. marsh air force base- middle of the night</strong>:
Technicians check monitors and prepare for the coming test. Nearby
stands a firing command module very reminiscent of the pilot’s
compartment in the opening sequence. Atherton goes over last minute
details with various people. He seems distracted as an engineer
discusses a problem with him.</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: What? Oh, yes, fine. Have you ever had a
feeling that there’s something terribly wrong?</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ext. main gate of the base-night</strong>: There are two Air
force Police GUARDS in the shack. Chris and Mitch pulls up in Kent’s
Citroen, behind a government sedan awaiting clearance at the gate. They
are dressed as technicians and Mitch sports a moustache.</p>
<p><strong>int. the citroen</strong>: Mitch is a wreck and Chris doesn’t
help. He begins humming the theme from “Mission Impossible.”</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: All clear, Mr. Decker. Just follow the yellow
line. Chris accidentally hits the horn. Through the windshield we SEE
Decker and the guard look back. Chris recognizes Decker.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: How long does it take?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Snap it up, will ya? We just flew in. We’re
tired. We’re hungry. We have this stupid car.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Are you out of your mind?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You have to intimidate these guys.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: You’re not on the list.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Of course not. We’re classified.</p>
<p><strong>int. command center</strong>: An Air Force Officer is on the
phone. An impatient Atherton stands beside him.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: I don’t know what he should look for, just
tell him if he sees anything out of the…let me tell him.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Aren’t you guys a little young to be
technicians?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Lasers are a young science. There, fine, now
you’ve made me say it. Now we’re all in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Look, I’ll call the duty officer.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Look, pal, don’t call anybody. We’re four
hours late. It’s our jobs. Give us a break, will ya? Someday you might
be in the private sector, right?</p>
<p><strong>second guard</strong>: We’re supposed to look for anything
out of the ordinary.</p>
<p><strong>first guard</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Nice work. Keep it up.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>int. hopsfield’s lair - same time</strong>: The computer
receives a signal. Hopsfield turns to Jordan and Ick.</p>
<p><strong>hopsfield</strong>: We’ve got a connection. They’re in.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Get the EEPROMs.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Abbott to Costello.</p>
<p><strong>int. hopsfield’s lair</strong>: Jordan picks up the
phone.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: This is Costello. Go ahead, Abbott.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Costello, who’s on first?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: We’ve got the goodies.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: We have the target coordinates computed for
trajectory adjustment.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Great. Shoot.</p>
<p><strong>int. hopsfield’s lair</strong>: Hopsfield’s computer screen
fills with machine code of ones and zeros. He begins searching through
many screens of code.</p>
<p><strong>hopsfield</strong>: Oh, oh.</p>
<p><strong>ick</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>hopsfield</strong>: Oh, nothing.</p>
<p><strong>int. bomb bay</strong>: Chris and Mitch freeze as a mechanic
walks by the open bomb bay door.</p>
<p><strong>int. command center - early morning</strong>: Technicians are
checking monitors and a radar scope at a control panel. Atherton is in
the rear of the room briefing a group of civilians and military brass.
Amongst them is Decker. Atherton points to a drawing on a large
chart.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: The plane will reach an altitude of
sixty-five thousand feet. When it is over, the target will fire the
laser from here …. … for five point two seconds.</p>
<p><strong>carmichael</strong>: They’re all set for the final onboard
check.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Fine. Right this way, gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>int. bomb bay</strong>: Chris and Mitch sweat it out.</p>
<p><strong>int. hopsfield’s lair</strong>: Hopsfield is scanning the
screens.</p>
<p><strong>hopsfield</strong>: I think I’ve found it. May I have the
coordinates, please.</p>
<p><strong>ick</strong>: Thirty-four degrees, ten minutes, fifteen
seconds North; one hundred eighteen degrees, nine minutes, three seconds
West.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: We’re sending.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: We’re taking.</p>
<p><strong>mitch’s pov</strong>: Atherton and his group come around the
corner of a building and head for the plane.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: They’re coming this way.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You may be interested in knowing that Mitch
reports that Herr Professor is approaching and I’m not even sweating.
Isn’t that remarkable?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Please hurry. Atherton’s coming.</p>
<p><strong>hopsfield</strong>: Please, I don’t work well under
pressure.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Okay, Chris … I mean Abbott. Hello … hello …
hello …</p>
<p><strong>ext. bomber</strong>: Atherton and his group approach and
enter the bomb bay.</p>
<p><strong>int. bomb bay</strong>: As they enter, there is no sign of
Chris and Mitch. Atherton checks out the laser and the computer. The
others examine various gauges and switches and the flight deck.</p>
<p><strong>carmichael</strong>: Everything all right?</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>ext. bomber</strong>: As the group exits the plane, Chris and
Mitch drop out of the forward landing gear well in the background.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Oh, I forgot …</p>
<p><strong>atherton’s pov</strong>: A glimpse of Chris and Mitch as they
disappear around the corner of the building.</p>
<p><strong>close on atherton</strong>: Uncertain of what he has just
seen.</p>
<p><strong>carmichael</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>int. dorm library - pre-dawn</strong>: Kent looks the worse
for wear as he sits surrounded by psychology books dealing with
schizophrenia.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Hi, Kent.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Oh, I thought you were gone.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Not yet. Have you been touching yourself?</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Yes. I mean, no.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Good, Kent. Dad, my father, you know, God,
wants to show you something.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Why? I mean, what?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: I’ve learned not to ask.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: He wants you to wait on the sidewalk at six
thirty nine Ivy Crest Drive at precisely six-oh-eight this morning.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Ivy Crest?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Just wait there and you shall receive a sign.
Do not despair and do not go inside.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Why not? Hello? Hello, Jesus?</p>
<p><strong>int. command center - dawn</strong>: Atherton and company
watch the bank of monitors as the flight controller clears the bomber
for take off.</p>
<p><strong>ext. campus - dawn</strong>: Chris and Mitch jump into the
van and drive off.</p>
<p><strong>int. command center</strong>: Some monitors show the bomber
climbing while others show the desert target area. It is a mock up of a
Presidential motorcade. The open cars are filled with test dummies, and
are linked together and are being towed slowly across the desert by a
tractor.</p>
<p><strong>controller</strong>: Crossbow One, radar contact. Climb and
maintain flight level six five oh.</p>
<p><strong>ext. atherton’s house</strong>: The van pulls up and parks
across the street. Chris and Mitch get out. Just then, a Volvo pulls up
and Jordan, Ick and Dr. Meredith get out. Dr. Meredith is wearing a
bathrobe, pajamas and slippers.</p>
<p><strong>meredith</strong>: Ah, Mr. Kinsley. Why am I not surprised to
see you here? Perhaps you have the explanation for this so-called event
I’m suppose to witness.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Yes, sir, I do, but first may I take this
opportunity to compliment you on your fashion sense.</p>
<p><strong>controller</strong>: Crossbow One, turn left to two eight
zero.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Two eight zero, roger.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Norman, if you’d be so kind. This cockpit
mock-up duplicates the shuttle flight deck and we’ve placed it here to
demonstrate the firing technique.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: We are thirty one DME from the target.</p>
<p><strong>controller</strong>: Roger, Crossbow. Open the doors.</p>
<p><strong>int. bomb bay</strong>: The doors open to reveal clouds
rushing past and the ground far below.</p>
<p><strong>meredith</strong>: These are rather strong accusations,
Chris.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Yes, sir, I know.</p>
<p><strong>meredith</strong>: If they’re true, I’m going to need some
proof.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I think we’re going to be able to accommodate
you in just a minute, sir.</p>
<p><strong>int. command center</strong>: Inside the firing module, the
specialist pulls down the target sighting device and puts his hands on
the joysticks.</p>
<p><strong>specialist</strong>: Power on.</p>
<p><strong>controller</strong>: T minus fifty and counting.</p>
<p><strong>int. bomb bay</strong>: The large mirror lowers into its
firing position and the laser powers up.</p>
<p><strong>ext. atherton’s house - morning</strong>: The group watch
Kent, who is nervously pacing back and forth, talking to himself.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Boy, if this works, he’s going to start a new
religion.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: If it doesn’t work …?</p>
<p><strong>int. command center</strong>: This countdown continues.
Monitors display the target sight, the pilot’s sighting screen of the
ground and a camera’s view of the bomber.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: Trajectory command relay, locked.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Now, Norm here has firing control.</p>
<p><strong>angle on targeting monitor</strong>: The target motorcade is
sighted.</p>
<p><strong>int. bomb bay</strong>: The laser mirror and sighting lens
move in unison as they line up on target.</p>
<p><strong>int. command center</strong>: The crosshairs line up on the
sighting monitor.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: What’s he doing?</p>
<p><strong>their pov</strong>: Kent has now started toward the front
door.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: I told him not to go in!</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Look, this is Jerry’s house, we’re very close,
so if you’re not going to answer me, then I’m going in …</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: … here I come.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Kent! Stop!</p>
<p><strong>angle on kent</strong>: who turns and sees them.</p>
<p><strong>int. command center</strong>: Everyone is riveted to the
sighting monitor.</p>
<p><strong>specialist</strong>: Target locked. In ten, nine, eight …</p>
<p><strong>int. bomb bay</strong>: The computer comes to life and
electronically unlocks the laser optics from the sighting camera. The
mirror turns to the left.</p>
<p><strong>int. command center</strong>: The aerial view of the
motorcade remains centered on the sighting monitor.</p>
<p><strong>int. atherton’s house</strong>: Kent opens the front door and
enters.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: That looked like Dr. Meredith in a bathrobe.
First I’m hearing things, now I’m seeing things.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Okay, God. Let me have it.</p>
<p><strong>specialist</strong>: … three, two, one, bingo.</p>
<p><strong>int. bomb bay</strong>: The laser fires.</p>
<p><strong>ext. sky</strong>: The laser beam traces through the
atmosphere.</p>
<p><strong>int. command center</strong>: The group waits expectantly.
Nothing happens to the target.</p>
<p><strong>ext. atherton’s house</strong>: Chris and Mitch, who are
running toward the house, are stopped in their tracks by the incredible
sight of the red laser beam shooting down out of the heavens, striking
the grass, tracking across the lawn then up the wall of Atherton’s
house.</p>
<p><strong>int. atherton’s house</strong>: The beam strikes the window
and for one tiny moment causes the most incredible light show anyone has
ever seen.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Oh, my!</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Popcorn?</p>
<p><strong>ext. atherton’s house</strong>: The beam disappears as
suddenly as it came. Everyone stands in awe. A few kernels fly out of
the broken window, then a storm.</p>
<p><strong>int. atherton’s house</strong>: Kent and furniture are being
forced up the stairs by a rising tide of popping popcorn. He struggles
against it, loses, and sinks into the mound like a dinosaur in
quicksand.</p>
<p><strong>ext. atherton’s house</strong>: The windows are filling up
with popcorn. Finally, they crack and break as popcorn forces its way
out of the house wherever it can.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Kent!</p>
<p><strong>int. command center</strong>: People furiously check
systems.</p>
<p><strong>carmichael</strong>: I don’t understand. Did it fire?</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: Yes, we indicate a shot. We’ve got
another problem, though. It’s not shutting down.</p>
<p><strong>int. bomb bay</strong>: The computer is still working. The
laser optics and equipment begin to melt. It’s been wired to
self-destruct.</p>
<p><strong>int. command center</strong>: The devastated group watches
the laser self destruct on the monitor.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Nice going, Jer.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Something’s wrong here. Unlock the bird’s
eye.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: I’m tracing where the shot went.</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Oh, no.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: What have you done?</p>
<p><strong>atherton</strong>: Retired.</p>
<p><strong>ext. atherton’s house</strong>: The group looks on as the
mountain of popcorn continues to engulf the house. Meredith goes to see
if Kent is all right.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Do you think we used too much?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Maybe a little.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Well, I guess we all learned something here
today.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I don’t know, but it seemed like the right
thing to say, didn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>ick</strong>: It did to me.</p>
<p><strong>hopsfield</strong>: I think you used too much.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Really? I’m sorry you missed it.</p>
<p><strong>hopsfield</strong>: Yeah, well, I had to pack.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>hopsfield</strong>: I’m getting married.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: What? To whom?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: What is all this?</p>
<p><strong>hopsfield</strong>: Oh, I won. Only thirty-one point eight
percent though. I have to figure that out. But not this summer.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Sherry?</p>
<p><strong>sherry</strong>: Hi. Isn’t it wonderful. I finally found him.
Number One. I’ve been looking for him for ten years.</p>
<p><strong>hopsfield</strong>: What can I do? She loves me.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Right. Congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>hopsfield</strong>: Thanks. Anyway, we probably won’t ever
get to see you again, so, bye.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: What do you mean? Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>sherry</strong>: I’ve got a little survival place in Wyoming.
We’re going to live there.</p>
<p><strong>hopsfield</strong>: Yeah, it’s getting too weird around here.
See ya.</p>
<p><strong>ick</strong>: You think it’s getting too weird around
here.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: I didn’t notice.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: I like it.</p>
