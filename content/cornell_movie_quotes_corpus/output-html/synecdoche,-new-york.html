<p><strong>radio voice</strong>: … a Labor Day luncheon today –</p>
<p><strong>olive radio voice</strong>: Mommy! Done! – at Stuckey Hall
–</p>
<p><strong>adeleradio voice</strong>: Okay!– in downtown Schenectady –
Adele leaves the kitchen. Caden, also 40, enters as she’s leaving. He’s
dressed in a ratty terrycloth robe.</p>
<p><strong>cadenadele</strong>: Morning. Morning. Tried not to wake
you.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Thanks. You didn’t. I was just – As Caden’s
voice goes under, we follow Adele into –</p>
<p><strong>adelecaden</strong>: Caden, could you get that? It’s Maria. I
don’t want to.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Ugh. Caden! That’s weird. The phone stops
ringing.</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: Is something wrong with my poop?</p>
<p><strong>adelemaria’s voice</strong>: No, honey. It’s just green.Hi,
it’s me. Where are you? Maybe you ate somethingI’ll try you on your
cell. green.</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: I didn’t! What’s wrong with me?! A cellphone
rings in the other room.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Honey, I have to get this. You’re going to be
fine.</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: But, Mommy – Adele runs into –</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p>****: Oh, wiping Olive’s ass. You? Caden is pouring himself a cup of
coffee. He sips it and stares out the window. It’s raining.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: You’re kidding! Holy fuck! Caden exits with
his coffee, annoyed about the phone call.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I don’t feel well.</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: Daddy, my poop is green. Caden enters the
bathroom, looks into the bowl at the green feces and smeared toilet
paper. He seems freaked out.</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: Am I going to be okay?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Of course, honey.</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: Did you have green poop when you were
little?</p>
<p><strong>cadenolive</strong>: I’m sure I did, honey. Am I going to
die?</p>
<p><strong>cadenolive</strong>: Of course not. You probablyI didn’t! I
didn’t eat ate something – green!</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: It’ll be fine, sweetie. I’ll be back in a
minute.</p>
<p>****: Is poop alive?</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: All right, baby. See you then. Adele clicks
off her cellphone.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Harold Pinter died!</p>
<p><strong>adelecaden</strong>: Yeah? Huh. Well, he wasOh wait. He won
the Nobel old, right?Prize. Good for him.</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: Mom!</p>
<p><strong>adele olive</strong>: What?!Do you need to come look at my
poop again?!</p>
<p><strong>adele olive</strong>: No, Olive, it’s fine. JustWhat if it’s
alive? What if flush.I kill it? It’s green! Like plants!</p>
<p><strong>adele caden</strong>: It’s not alive, honey.God, remember
that production of The Dumbwaiter I did at Albanyfest? The toilet is
flushed.</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: Everything’s alive. Everything grows big.
That’s how you know. Olive enters.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: I have your oatmeal, honey.</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: I want peanut butter and jelly.</p>
<p><strong>adele olive</strong>: Olive, c’mon. You told me I don’t want
oatmeal. oatmeal. This isn’t a restaurant. Adele growls, grabs the
oatmeal, dumps it in the sink.</p>
<p><strong>olive caden</strong>: Sorry, Mommy! I’m sorry! They found
Avian flu in Turkey. In the country Turkey not turkeys. It’s in
chickens. Adele is making a peanut butter sandwich for Olive.</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: Can I watch TV till school? Caden clicks the
remote for Olive and goes back to his paper. A cartoon cow talks to a
cartoon sheep.</p>
<p><strong>cow</strong>: There is a secret, something at play under the
surface, growing like an invisible virus of thought. The sheep nods.
Caden pours himself some more coffee, opens the milk carton to pour some
in, then sniffs at the spout. He checks the date on the carton. It’s
October 20.</p>
<p><strong>caden cow</strong>: Man. Milk’s expired. Jesus. But you are
being changed by it. Second by second. Every breath counts off time.
Caden goes back to his paper. Adele puts a peanut butter sandwich in
front of Olive.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Here. Now you better eat this.</p>
<p><strong>olive caden</strong>: I will. The first black graduate of the
University of Alabama died. Vivian Malone Jones. Stroke. Only 63. Adele
stares out the window at the rain.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Jesus! Caden! What the fuck – ?! Olive, in a
nightgown, stands quietly in the doorway, her curled toes clenched. She
holds a large stuffed owl.</p>
<p><strong>cadenadele</strong>: Um. I was shaving and – My God! Jesus!
Look at your head! Dumbly, Caden tries to look up at his forehead, then
squints nervously at himself in the mirror.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Honey, don’t look. Olive turns around.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Put pressure. Press. Press!</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Do I press above or below it?</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: I don’t know! Just… both! Caden sits on the
toilet, presses a towel to his head. Adele squats, goes into a spasmodic
coughing fit, finishes, opens the cabinet under the sink, pushes her arm
through bottles of cleaning products, old sponges, old toothbrushes,
toilet paper rolls and other junk to the shut-off valves.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: I can’t turn it! It’s gonna flood! Olive hugs
the owl tightly and it speaks.</p>
<p><strong>owladele</strong>: Whooo. Whooo. Whooo areI can’t – Oh wait,
got it! you? Adele turns off the water. Olive looks back into the
room.</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: Mommy, Daddy has blood.</p>
<p><strong>9 continued:9</strong>: Caden squints into the bright light
the doctor uses to see his work. In the background we hear another
patient.</p>
<p>****: Please, please, please… Caden sees a nurse shoving a tube far
up into a man’s nose. Another nurse wipes away the blood leaking out his
nostril.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Will there be a scar?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Probably. It looks like a mudflap.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I prefer there not be a scar.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: That fellow is annoying. He’s in here every
week. Like clockwork. The off-screen patient continues to whimper. The
doctor finishes his work on Caden.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: There. I think that should – He looks at
Caden’s eyes, turns off the bright lamp and looks again. He turns the
lamp back on and looks once more.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: What? The doctor feels Caden’s pulse, then
listens to his heart. He presses hard against the glands in Caden’s
neck.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Changes in bowel movements?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: A little more yellow than usual. What?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: I’d like you to see an ophthalmologist.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: A neurologist?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: What? No, an ophthalmologist. I said,
ophthalmologist.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Oh. The doctor stares blankly at Caden for a
long moment, then looks suspiciously in Caden’s ears.</p>
<p>****: It’s a beautiful day and the sun is shining and yellow. And the
world is too big to understand and today is Tuesday and –</p>
<p>****: Mom, is today Tuesday?</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: No, it’s Friday, honey.</p>
<p>****: And today is Friday and… Olive’s singing continues but goes
under.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: So what exactly did he say?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: My pupils weren’t properly dilating and, um,
not doing the opposite …</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Constricting.</p>
<p><strong>caden adele</strong>: No. Yes. The bump to the head?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: He doesn’t know. Maybe. He said he doesn’t
think so. But maybe. But he doesn’t know. But –</p>
<p><strong>adele caden</strong>: Okay. I got it. Jesus.Sorry. I’m a
little anxious.</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: Did you have to get a shot, Daddy?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: No, honey. It’s the start of something
awful.</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: Do I have to get a shot?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: What? No. Of course not. This is really
fucked timing.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Caden.</p>
<p><strong>caden olive</strong>: Sorry. Bad timing.Did you tell him I
have green poop?</p>
<p><strong>adele caden</strong>: Remind me to call the plumber, would
you? I need aI have rehearsal! Fuck! to-do list. Caden!</p>
<p><strong>caden olive</strong>: Sorry.How many years till I have to get
more shots?</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Not for a long time, honey. Caden pulls out a
cell phone and dials.</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: A million years?</p>
<p><strong>adele olive</strong>: Remember Dr. Woodman said Dad, what’s a
plumber? after the last vaccination –</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: He’s the man who –</p>
<p><strong>adele caden</strong>: Or woman, Dad.Right. He’s the man or
woman who fixes sinks and toilets and… do you know what pipes are?</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Hey, Jim. I know. I’m sorry. I had an
accident. No, I’m okay.</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: Like to smoke out of?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Different kind of pipe. Just run lines. I’ll
be there soon. ’kay. Houses have pipes. They’re, like, tubes and they’re
behind walls and under the floor everywhere and – Olive begins to
whimper in horror.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: What’s wrong, baby?</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: Every-single-where?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: It’s okay. They just carry water to and from
sinks and bathtubs and toilets. It’s like in your body you have veins
and … um…</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Capillaries.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: And they’re filled with blood. Olive is
crying in earnest now.</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: I don’t want blood. I have blood?</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: What are you doing? Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I’m trying to explain plumbing.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Well, stop it. It’s okay, honey.</p>
<p>****: I don’t want blood. Will it hurt? Will it hurt, Daddy?!</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: No, honey, you’re fine.</p>
<p><strong>olive caden</strong>: I don’t want blood! I don’t want blood!
I don’t wantI can’t do this now. blood…</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: You don’t have to worry, baby. You don’t have
blood.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Well, I don’t think you should tell her she
doesn’t have blood.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Caden, stop it! Olive cries. Adele coughs.
Caden stares out the window. It’s dark, but his pupils are
pinpricks.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Thanks for getting me in right away. The
doctor touches Caden’s eye repeatedly with a small probe.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Is it the bump to the head?</p>
<p><strong>ophthalmologist</strong>: No. Could be. But I think we need
to get you to a neurologist. Nothing urgent.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: A neurologist?</p>
<p><strong>ophthalmologist</strong>: Yes, a brain expert.</p>
<p><strong>caden ophthalmologist</strong>: I know what a neurologist is.
Fine. I just thought from the way you asked –</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I thought maybe you said urologist. Why do I
need to see a neurologist?</p>
<p><strong>ophthalmologist</strong>: For a look-see. The eyes are part
of the brain, after all.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: That’s not true, is it?</p>
<p><strong>ophthalmologist</strong>: Why would I say it if it weren’t
true?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: It just doesn’t seem right.</p>
<p><strong>ophthalmologist</strong>: Like morally correct? Or right as
in accurate?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I’m not sure. Accurate, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>ophthalmologist</strong>: Hmm. Interesting. The doctor writes
in Caden’s chart.</p>
<p><strong>12continued:12</strong>: Tom, the actor playing Willy Loman,
stands center stage. Claire, the actress playing Linda Loman, sits in
the set’s bedroom. Davis, the actor playing Biff, lies on the top bunk
of a bunk bed upstage. A fourth actor, playing Happy, lies on the bottom
bunk.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Willy, you coming up!!!!</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Sssssh!!</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Willy? Tom climbs in the car.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Willy? Answer me!…Willy! Tom starts the car
and guns the engine. A brick wall off stage speeds into the car,
accompanied by crashing and screeching sound effects.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: No!!!</p>
<p><strong>davis</strong>: Pop!! The wall continues to be pulled past
the car crashing into the rest of the set, knocking walls over, creating
havoc. A lamp post falls and hits Claire, knocking her over.</p>
<p><strong>caden claire</strong>: Yeah yeah, I’m fine. It’s no Oh crap,
Claire, are youbig deal. okay?</p>
<p><strong>caden david</strong>: David, what’s happening here? Sorry,
Caden. Hold on. David runs on stage to deal with the mess.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: It’s too late in the game to be having these
problems, David. You’re sure you’re okay?</p>
<p><strong>clairedavid</strong>: God yes, it was funny.I know, Caden.
I’m sorry. We’ll get it. Tom emerges from the car, covered with stage
blood.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Please. That was good, Tom.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Yeah? I was trying something different. I was
crashing differently. Ambivalently.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I saw that. I like it. Caden meets Tom at the
foot of the stage. Behind them a group of technicians are lifting the
wall and trying to re- set it. Claire primps in the bureau mirror.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Try to keep in mind that a young person
playing Willy Loman thinks he’s only pretending to be at the end of a
life full of despair. But the tragedy is that we know that you, the
young actor, will end up in this very place of desolation.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Great. Let’s try it again.</p>
<p>****: How long, David?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I think fifteen.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Why don’t you get cleaned up, Tom, and we’ll
go again. Tom exits. Caden rubs his temples, then heads to the back of
the house, pulling out his cell phone. He exits the theater.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: I just heard the death of the salesman.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: In more ways than one.</p>
<p>****: Oh no.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: In search of elusive signal.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Signal’s good here, oddly. She pats her lap
in a friendly manner.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: That is odd.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: I know! Cell phones, they’re crazy!</p>
<p><strong>caden hazel</strong>: See you in a few. Yup.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Dr. Heshborg said I should see Dr. Scariano.
My pupils don’t work.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: I keep reading the first line. It’s a good
line, I think. But I don’t know much about literature.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Maybe you should read the first line of
another series of books.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: I’m trying to better myself, Caden. Recommend
me something. You’re a genius; you must’ve read nearly a dozen
books.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Exactly twelve. Have you read Kafka?</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Um, I’ve read his name. A lot! I swear!</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: His whole name?</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Okay, not his entire name. Heinz?</p>
<p>****: You should read The Trial, maybe.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: If you say so, I will. Can’t wait till
Wednesday. I’m so excited to see it.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I hope you like it.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: It’s pretty impossible that I won’t, you
know. I mean… She trails off, shrugs. They smile at each other. Caden
exits. Hazel looks at her book, re-reads the first sentence.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I think I have blood in my stool. Adele looks
over, half asleep.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: That stool in your office?</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: When I was pregnant with Olive…</p>
<p><strong>madeline</strong>: What was it like?</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Um… I don’t know. Hopeful or something. Like
something was going to change.</p>
<p><strong>madeline</strong>: Something did, no?</p>
<p><strong>adele caden</strong>: Yes, of course. Yes. I mean… big
time.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Maybe not as much as I had hoped. That’s a
terrible thing to say.</p>
<p><strong>madeline</strong>: There are no terrible things to say in
here. Only true and false.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: I feel alone sometimes. I feel exhausted. Can
I say something awful?</p>
<p><strong>madeline</strong>: Yes. Please do.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: I’ve fantasized about Caden dying and being
able to start again. Guilt free. I know it’s terrible.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: It’s a nightmare in there.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: The car crash?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Well… not only.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Sorry. So I’m reading The Trial.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Yeah? You like?</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Love. I’m such an idiot for not knowing about
this book. It’s famous, it turns out.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: You’re not an idiot. Pause.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Then you say, in fact, you’re very bright,
Hazel. And I love your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>cadenhazel</strong>: In fact, you’re very bright, Hazel. And
I love your eyes. Oh, am I? Oh, do you? Oh, darling!</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Then what do I say?</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: I can’t say what then you say.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Cause it’s dirty. A whistling noise turns
their heads. In the distance a man with an unopened parachute is
plummeting.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Oh my God! Jesus! They watch as the man falls
behind a building. A scream. A screech of brakes.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: He’s gotta be dead. Right?</p>
<p><strong>plumber</strong>: Go ahead. I’ve seen boy parts.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Can I piss in your sink?</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Um, yeah, I guess. Caden pisses in the sink
in the corner of the studio. His urine is amber. He finishes and peeks
over Adele’s shoulder, through the magnifying glass at the painting.
It’s an amazingly detailed and angrily colored painting of a woman in a
state of profound despair, screaming to the heavens, while standing in a
field of flames.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: It’s gorgeous, Ad.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Thanks. How was rehearsal?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Awful. We have five hundred and sixty
lighting cues. I don’t know why I made it so complicated.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: It’s what you do.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Yeah. Anyway, we got through it. I think
you’ll be impressed.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Caden, listen, I’m really sorry. I just can’t
go tonight. I’m sorry. I’ve got to get two canvases ready to ship. By
tomorrow. I know it sucks.</p>
<p><strong>cadenadele</strong>: But it’s opening night.I know. I’m
sorry. I would go if I could.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I have to get ready.</p>
<p><strong>adele caden</strong>: I’ll go tomorrow! We’ll makeI mean, I
can’t take a dump tomorrow like the premiere! in your sink! What am I
supposed to do? I have to get ready!</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Oh boy, oh boy.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Willy!</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: It’s all right, I came back.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Why? What happened?</p>
<p>****: Did something happen, Willy?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: No, nothing happened.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: You didn’t smash the car, did you?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I said nothing happened. Didn’t you hear
me?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Don’t you feel well?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I’m tired to death. I couldn’t make it. I just
couldn’t make it, Linda.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Where were you all day? You look
terrible.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I got as far as a little above Yonkers. I
stopped for a cup of coffee… maybe it was the coffee.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I suddenly couldn’t drive any more. The car
kept going off onto the shoulder, y’know? The audience is rapt. Caden
relaxes.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Ugh, I hated myself tonight. Plus I’m so
bloated and enormous.</p>
<p><strong>caden claire</strong>: No. You looked great. You I thought
Tom was amazing! were great. I was very pleased.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Yeah. Absolutely. Sorry. I have a bit of a
headache.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I just want to thank you for everything.
You’ve been absolutely brilliant and it’s going to be miserable going
ahead without you.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I’ll be around. I’ll check in. She gets
teary, gives him a kiss on the cheek.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: God, I’m such a baby. She just looks at him
and smiles and nods.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I’m going to get drunk, that’s what.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Ok, Claire. She backs away and gets lost in
the crowd. Caden massages his temples. Suddenly Hazel is next to
him.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: I figured I’d better get in fast.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: I loved it! And, by the way, Claire is
trouble. And not terribly bright. Caden laughs.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Just wanted you to know the word on the
street.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: So you liked it?</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Are you kidding? I cried for like fifteen
minutes after. I loved every minute of it. Except Claire. I thought she
was weak.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Easy on the eyes.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Oh, Caden, not you, too. What I want to know
is why she started crying in her last monologue, right after she had the
line, ‘I can’t cry for you Willy…’?</p>
<p>****: She felt very strongly that it was right. They sip their
drinks.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Where’s el wife-o?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Had to work. Her Berlin show is in two weeks.
We’re going to spend like a month there.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Ah.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Ah.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Ah.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Choo!</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Hooray! We’ve still got it!</p>
<p>****: I’ll miss you.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Yeah, me too.</p>
<p><strong>hazel caden</strong>: You’re going to miss you? Yeah, that’s
it.</p>
<p>****: Why do I like you so much?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I couldn’t begin to guess.</p>
<p>****: Me neither. It must be that you’re married. Do you get high, my
friend?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Y’know. Sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: You want to now? With me. In my car.</p>
<p><strong>cadenhazel</strong>: I don’t know.Come on, it’s a party.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I get kind of… something when I’m stoned.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: What does something mean?</p>
<p><strong>cadenhazel</strong>: I don’t know. Bothered?What does
bothered mean?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Y’know… bothered. Horny.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: And me with a station wagon and all. Could be
dangerous.</p>
<p>****: Yeah, it really could.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: You’re absolutely zero fun.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: You know I wish I could.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Jesus, I like you. I’m going.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: You’re not staying for the reviews?</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: I know it’s brilliant. I don’t need some dope
with elbow patches telling me. She smiles, gives him a hug, and heads
toward the door.</p>
<p><strong>later</strong>: Hazel studies the dog. It’s a bloody, gutty
mess, squashed flat. Against all odds, it’s still alive. Its head is
lolling. She bends down to pet it.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: You’re not going to make it, baby.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: What are you going to do now?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I’m going to Berlin for a month for my wife’s
show. Then I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I wish I was your wife or a wife or had a
wife. Or was German even. I’m so lonely with none of those things. A man
walks in with a bunch of newspapers.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Yay or nay?</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: I’ve always loved this house.</p>
<p><strong>realtor hazel</strong>: Yes. It’s a wonderful place.The truth
is, I never really imagined I could afford it.</p>
<p><strong>realtor</strong>: The sellers are very motivated now.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: It’s a scary decision. I never thought I’d
buy a house alone. But, y’know, I’m 36, and I wonder what I’m really
waiting for.</p>
<p><strong>realtor hazel</strong>: Home-buying is always scary.But I
mean with the fire and all especially.</p>
<p><strong>realtor</strong>: It’s a good size though, twenty-two hundred
square feet. Not including the partially-finished basement</p>
<p><strong>hazel realtor</strong>: I don’t know. I’m thinking IIt’s a
perfect size for should go.someone alone.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: I like it, I do. But I’m really concerned
about dying in the fire.</p>
<p><strong>realtor</strong>: It’s a big decision, how one prefers to
die. Would you like to meet my son? Derek?</p>
<p><strong>29 continued: 29</strong>: Derek, 40 and scruffily handsome,
appears around a corner.</p>
<p><strong>derekrealtor</strong>: Hey, Mom.Derek’s living in the
basement since his divorce. If that’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>adelecaden</strong>: Hey. Hey.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Hi, Caden. How’d it go?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Hi. It’s late.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Maria came over to keep me company and we
lost track. I’m sorry I missed the play. But I got everything done here.
How’d it go?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: We’re a hit. Reviews are great. New York
Times said it was brilliant to cast young actors as Willy and Linda.</p>
<p><strong>adelemaria</strong>: Great. That’s great, Caden! Good for
you!</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: I’ll see it tomorrow. Tonight! Adele and
Maria laugh.</p>
<p><strong>mariaadele</strong>: Jesus, it is late. Early!Can we get a
ticket for I’d love to see it, too. Maria? Adele smiles.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Are you stoned?</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: A little. I don’t know. Y’know? I mean, are
you happy with it?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Yeah. Love to know what you think.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: It doesn’t matter what I think.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Absolutely! It’s all about your artistic
satisfaction, Caden.</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: What’s wrong with your face, Daddy?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: It’s pustules. It’s called sycosis. Spelled
differently than psychosis, but it sounds the same.</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: I don’t know what that means.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Well, there’s two different kinds of
psychosis. They’re spelled differently. P-s-y is like if you’re crazy
and s-y is like these things on my face.</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: You could have both though.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I could. But I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: Okay, pretend we’re fairies. I’m a girl fairy
and my name is … La-ru…lee. And you’re a boy fairy and your name is
Teeteree.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Ok.</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: What’s my name again?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: La-ru-lee.</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: No. I said … La-ru-la…ay.</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: Pretend we fight each other. And I say stop
hitting me or I’ll die. And you say okay, but you’re fibbing. And you
hit me again.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: Okay. Let’s go. Hit me. They pretend to hit
each other. Olive makes hissing and roaring noises. She stops.</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: Okay. You have to stop hitting me now or I
will die.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Okay. He stops.</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: No! Pretend you’re fibbing! Remember? He mock
hits her again. She falls.</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: Now I have to die.</p>
<p>****: Pretend you say you don’t want me to die.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I don’t want you to die.</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: But I have to.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: But I’ll miss you.</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: I have to. And you’ll have to wait a million
years to see me again. Caden tears up at this and tries to conceal
it.</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: And I’ll be put in a box. And all I’ll need
is a tiny glass of water. And lots of – tiny pieces of pizza. And the
box will have wings, like an airplane.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Where will it take you?</p>
<p>****: Home.</p>
<p><strong>davis</strong>: Let’s go, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I’ll be with you in a minute. Go on,
Charley. I want to, just a minute. The other characters exit the
stage.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I never had a chance to say good- bye.
Forgive me, dear. I can’t cry. I don’t understand it; I can’t cry. It
seems to me that you’re just on another trip. I keep expecting you.
Willy, dear, why did you do it? I search and search and I search, and I
can ’t understand it, Willy. I made the last payment on the house today.
Today, dear. And there’ll be nobody home. We’re free and clearâ€¦ We’re
freeâ€¦ We’re freeâ€¦ We’re freeâ€¦</p>
<p><strong>33 continued:33</strong>: The stage lights go dark.</p>
<p><strong>caden adele</strong>: I just –I don’t know what it matters
what I think.</p>
<p><strong>caden’s mother</strong>: I loved the story. So
interesting.</p>
<p><strong>caden adele</strong>: Because your opinion is –It was good.
It was well done. It was very … successful.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Oh, I thought it was wonnnderful!</p>
<p><strong>caden’s father</strong>: Why were the old people so
young?</p>
<p><strong>cadenadele</strong>: It was a choice, Dad. I’ll Nothing. But
nothing. explain later. I can’t get excited about But? your restaging
someone else’s old play. There’s nothing personal in it.</p>
<p><strong>cadencadenâ€™s father</strong>: I put my soul into thatI
mean, they were younger thing. than their kids. That doesnâ€™t make
sense.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Do you really believe that tripe?</p>
<p><strong>cadencadenâ€™s mother</strong>: Wow. It’s not tripe. Jesus.I
liked that the old people were so young. It was interesting.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Ok, fine. But it’s not you. It’s not anyone.
It’s not real.</p>
<p><strong>cadenadele</strong>: People come out crying,Great. Be a
fucking tool of saying their lives are suburban blue-hair regional
changed and – theater subscribers. But what are you leaving behind? You
act as if you have forever to figure it out.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Why are you being like this? Adele has a
coughing fit.</p>
<p><strong>adelecaden</strong>: I’m not being like anything. Are you
seeing someone else?</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Is that your entire frame of reference for
relationship problems?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: No. I don’t know. It’s a stressful time. Our
shows. The whole health thing.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Oh, you’re fine.</p>
<p><strong>jackal</strong>: When you are dead there is no time. The
world is a timeless rock. Caden pours a cup of coffee, sits down at the
table.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I think I might have arthritis. Adele
continues to talk on the phone.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: No, I know. Exactly. Caden picks up the
newspaper. It’s dated May 25th, 2006. He flips through, finds the
obituaries and starts to read.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Ok. All right. Yeah. Ok, bye. Adele hangs up
the phone, looks at the paper.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: My joints are stiff. Who was that?</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Maria.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Right. It’s been three hours since you
spoke.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Caden, I think I want to go to Berlin with
just Olive. Caden looks up.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: I think it would be good for us. Silence.
Caden’s father appears in the doorway.</p>
<p><strong>caden’s fathercaden</strong>: Morning, kiddos. Christ. Is
this about last night? Caden’s father smiles, nods, and exits.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Can I ask you a question, Ad? She looks up at
him.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Have I disappointed you somehow? She starts
to cry, hugs him.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Caden. I don’t know. Y’know? I don’t know
what I’m doing. It’s just a little time apart.</p>
<p>****: We’ll talk when I get back. Everyone is disappointing. The more
you know someone. The whole romantic love thing is just projection.
Right? I don’t know.</p>
<p>****: I’m sorry. I love you. I don’t know what I’m doing. We’ll talk
when I get back.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Flurostatin TR allows you to live life
when it’s your turn to face the challenges of chemotherapy. Ask your
doctor if it’s right for you. He feels the bumps on his arm, which have
grown. He writes down Fluorostatin TR. He starts to clean Adele’s
studio. Later: The room is sparkling. No more paint anywhere. Caden is
on his knees, scrubbing the last bit of dirt. He is sweaty and
focused.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: We should get a drink. Be fun.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Be weird.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: I like weird. I like you. See? He doesn’t say
anything.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Anyway. I don’t want to make you
uncomfortable. I just thought it would be a fun diversion. Okay, I do
want to make you uncomfortable.</p>
<p>****: Oh, Haze. I wish I could.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: You can, Cade. You can!</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I have an appointment.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Crease.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: It’s just a word. Don’t get all bent out of
shape. Jeez.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I won’t. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>caden madeline</strong>: I’m lonely.Yes. Anything else? Caden
notices Madeline’s feet in too-small shoes. There are visible blisters
and band-aids on her feet.</p>
<p><strong>caden madeline</strong>: I’m hurt.Yes. And?</p>
<p><strong>caden madeline</strong>: I think Adele’s right whenWhat would
be real? she says I’m not doing anything real.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I’m afraid I’m going to die. They don’t know
what’s wrong with me. I want to do something important. While I’m still
here.</p>
<p><strong>madeline</strong>: That would be the time to do it, yes. I
have a book that might help you get better.</p>
<p><strong>cadenmadeline</strong>: Better?Yes. It’s called Getting
Better.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Who wrote it?</p>
<p><strong>madeline caden</strong>: I did. Oh. All of these.Wow. I never
knew that.</p>
<p><strong>madeline</strong>: Wow. Yes, wow. Wow indeed. She hands Caden
the very thick book. He flips through it, catching words and snippets
here and there: Clairaudience … vaginal juices… The echo began …
Plumbing … Cats eat rats … Me who am as a raw nerve … Crease.</p>
<p><strong>madeline</strong>: That’s forty-five dollars. Wow.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I’m looking for… I’m sorry, I don’t speak
German. No. I’m –</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: We must live in the present moment. The now.
The now. The now. Caden tries to be in the present moment as a women
sings about gingivitis on a small stage in the back.</p>
<p><strong>singer</strong>: How do you know if youâ€™ve got gingivitis?
/ Hereâ€™s an experiment, Go ahead try this: / Brush your teeth, then
spit in the sink / Does it come out red? / Do they say your breath
stinks? Itâ€™ll only get worse, thatâ€™s just the beginning / Your mouth
will be cursed, thereâ€™s no hope of winning / Necrotizing ulcerative
gingivitis is next / Also called trench mouth, / youâ€™ll never get sex.
Later: Caden nurses a beer. He seems unwell.</p>
<p>****: Iâ€™m just a little person One person in a sea Of many little
people Who are not aware of me. I do my little job And live my little
life I eat my little meals Miss my little kid and wife. And somewhere
Maybe someday Maybe somewhere Far away</p>
<p><strong>singer</strong>: Iâ€™ll meet another little person Who will
look at me and say I know you Youâ€™re the one Iâ€™ve waited for Letâ€™s
have some fun Life is precious Every minute And more precious With you
in it. So letâ€™s have some fun. Letâ€™s take a road trip Way out west
Youâ€™re the one I like the best. Iâ€™m glad I found you Like hanging
â€˜round you Youâ€™re the one I like the best. Hazel plops down across
from him. She has a smudge of soot on her nose.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Hey! Thanks for meeting me. He points to his
nose. She wipes at the soot on hers.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: God, I’m delighted. Thought you’d never ask.
You did ask, right?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I didn’t want to be alone.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Who does?</p>
<p>****: You don’t look like you feel well.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I’m going through some things.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: You want to tell me about it?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I can’t really. But I’m meditating and
running and taking vitamins.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Cutting out sugar. I can’t really say any
more. It’s …</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Ok. Tell me something else.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: You tell me something. Oh. I’ve cut out
wheat.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Um, I bought this really nifty sweater today.
On sale. Fifty dollars reduced from three hundred!</p>
<p><strong>cadenhazel</strong>: It’s beautiful.It’s cashmere. So very
soft. You must feel it. Hazel holds her arm out. Caden touches it.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: What do we do with all this, Hazel?</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: I don’t know. We fuck? We continue to sort of
flirt? You divorce your wife and marry me and I make you happy for the
very first time in your life and all your symptoms disappear?</p>
<p>****: We call it a day?</p>
<p>****: Don’t choose the last one. I just said that one for effect.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Do I have to choose at all?</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: No, I suppose not. Choosing is not your
strong suit. You want to come over to my place, Cotard?</p>
<p><strong>cadenhazel</strong>: Um … I’m won’t let you off the hook by
saying “never mind” this time.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Adele is only on vacation.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: She hasn’t called you since she left. You’ve
left countless messages. It’s been a year.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: It’s been a week.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: I’m going to buy you a calendar. Caden rips a
cocktail napkin into little pieces.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Okay, just for one drink. Hazel smiles and
stands. She scoops up the torn napkin pieces and puts them in her
purse.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Scraps for my scrapbook. Caden watches her
ass as she turns to leave.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I really can’t drink very much because of my
condition.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Caden’s mysterious condition. Well, have one
sip, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Did you put something in it?</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Would you like me to have? A little love
potion, perhaps?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Sure, why not?</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: If that’s what it takes, consider it done.
Poof! Love potion number</p>
<p><strong>47 continued:47</strong>: Caden laughs and takes a sip.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: It’s good. She takes a sip of her drink.
Caden drinks some more of his.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Does it make you want to kiss me?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Yeah. Kind of.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Tell me why?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Um, I feel a lot of longing.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Hmm. Beg a girl, why dontcha.</p>
<p><strong>cadenhazel</strong>: Um, okay. Please, Hazel, let On your
knees. me –</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: I’d like you to beg me on your knees for a
kiss. Just for fun. Dumbly, Caden gets down on his knees.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Why am I doing this?</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: For fun, baby.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: You’ll help me forget my troubles?</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Oh, kiddo, you don’t even know.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I have a wife.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: You have me. And I adore you.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: What? What is it?</p>
<p><strong>cadenhazel</strong>: I don’t know. I’m sorry. What?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I’m just so confused. I’m sorry. I’m really
sick. I think I’m dying. I have a kid. I’m married.</p>
<p><strong>hazelcaden</strong>: Oh, Jesus. Oh, fuck me.I’m sorry. It’s
terrible, I know.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Yeah. I just thought this might change
things. I hoped. Ugh.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I had a good time. I think you’re a very nice
person. Really.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: That is just the wrong thing to say right
now, Caden. You should go.</p>
<p>****: I’m so glad I finally got you.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Hello? Hello? Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: It’s Caden!</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Ellen?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Caden! I can’t wait to see you and Olive on
the 12th. um… I went someplace without you tonight, Ad. I went some
place you couldn’t come with me. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: What? Who is this? Oh, I have to go. There’s
a party. I’m famous!</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Oh. Ok. Great. Have fu – The connection is
lost. Caden sits there, looks at the 2007 tax form in front of him, goes
into convulsions. He manages to grab the phone, his hand flopping all
over the dial.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: 911. What’s the problem, ma’am?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I’m sick.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: We’re out of ambulances, miss, but we’ll
send a taxi. Please wait in front of your house, miss.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Mr. Cotard? He looks up, having forgotten
where he was. He grabs his suitcase and follows the nurse down a dismal
hallway: gurneys against dirty walls, empty wheelchairs. Skinny man
takes a flash picture of Caden. Nurses drinking coffee out of paper cups
eye him. Puddles of vomit on the floor. They arrive at the end of the
hall. A doctor pokes his head out of a room. He studies a file and
doesn’t look up.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Mr. Cotard?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: You’ve had a seizure of sorts.</p>
<p><strong>caden doctor</strong>: What does that mean?Seems to be some
synaptic degradation. Fungal in origin. Autonomic functions going
haywire.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: It’s serious?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: We don’t know but yes. They both sit there
in silence for a long while.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: We’ll get you enrolled a biofeedback
program. Maybe you can learn some sort of manual override.</p>
<p><strong>hazel caden</strong>: Be quiet, Squishy.Hi.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Caden, I won’t be yet another woman you feel
guilty about.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Okay. Thank you anyway.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Here. Take this. I got like five for
Christmas. Goddamn Christmas. She hands him a 2009 calendar. It features
photos of Adele.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Now. Now. Now! Be here now!</p>
<p><strong>caden madeline</strong>: So I just got this MacArthurOh,
Caden! Grant last night.</p>
<p><strong>caden madeline</strong>: Yeah. A lot of money. Do you know
what you’re going to do with it?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: A theater piece. Something big and true and
tough. Y’know, finally put my real self into something.</p>
<p><strong>madelinecaden</strong>: Oh, Caden! What is your realI don’t
know yet. The self, do you think? MacArthur is called “the genius
grant.” And I want to earn it.</p>
<p><strong>madeline</strong>: That’s wonderful. God bless! I guess
you’ll have to discover your real self. Right?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Yeah, I mean, yeah. Oh, I wanted to ask you,
how old are kids when they start to write?</p>
<p><strong>madeline</strong>: Varies.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Could a four year old keep a diary?</p>
<p><strong>madeline</strong>: Listen, there’s an absolutely brilliant
novel written by a four year old.</p>
<p><strong>cadenmadeline</strong>: Really?Little Winky. By Horace
Azpiazu.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Aww. Cute.</p>
<p><strong>madeline</strong>: Hardly. Little Winky is a virulent
anti-Semite.</p>
<p><strong>madeline</strong>: The story follows his initiation into the
Klan, his immersion in the pornographic snuff industry and his ultimate
degradation at the hands of a black ex-convict named Eric Washington
Jackson Jones… Johnson… Jefferson, with whom he embarks on a brutal
homosexual affair.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Wow. Written by a four year old?</p>
<p><strong>madeline</strong>: Azpiazu killed himself at five.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: That’s horrible.</p>
<p><strong>madeline</strong>: He would’ve written so much more had he
lived. They developed a method – some software – to determine what he
would’ve written had he lived to ten, twenty, thirty, etcetera.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Is that possible?</p>
<p><strong>madeline</strong>: Which part?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Any of it. Why did he kill himself?</p>
<p><strong>madeline</strong>: I don’t know, why did you?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>madeline</strong>: I said, why would you?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Oh. I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Deer Diry. Thank you for being my new best
frend. My name is Olive Cotard. I am for yers old. I like choclit and
–</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: – my favorite color is pink.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I’m looking for a Christmas present for my
daughter. Something pink.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: How about this? The clerk holds up a pink box
with a picture of a nose on it.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Yes. That’s good.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: The idea is to do a massive theater piece.
Uncompromising, honest. I don’t know what it is yet or how to do it, but
it’ll come. It’ll reveal itself.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Huh. Pause.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Hereâ€™s what I think theater is: itâ€™s the
beginning of thought. The truth not yet spoken. Itâ€™s a blackbird in
winter. The moment before death. Itâ€™s what a man feels after heâ€™s
been clocked in the jaw. Itâ€™s love… in all its messiness. And I want
all of us, players and audience alike, to soak in the communal bath of
it, the mikvah, as the Jews call it. Weâ€™re all in the same water,
after all, soaking in our very menstrual blood and nocturnal emissions.
This is what I want to try to give people, Hazel. And I want your help.
Hazel just stares. The food arrives. Caden looks at his plate and
concentrates.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Salivating.</p>
<p>****: I have to concentrate.</p>
<p>****: Biofeedback training.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Huh.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: So I was wondering if you’ll help.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: In your box office?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: No. Like as my assistant.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: I’m not sure I can work with you, Caden. I’m
kind of angry.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I just want to normalize it, Hazel. I think
we’d have fun together. He swallows some food then concentrates. She
watches him.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I miss you. He concentrates some more. She
stares at him.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I’m digesting.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: It’s really disturbing.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: We’ll start by talking honestly. Out of that
a piece of theater will evolve. I’ll begin.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I’ve been thinking a lot about dying
lately.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: You’re going to be fine, sweetie.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I appreciate that, Claire, but –</p>
<p><strong>clairecaden</strong>: Well, you are. You poor regardless of
how this thing.particular thing works itself out, I will be dying. So
will you.</p>
<p><strong>clairecaden</strong>: Caden!So will everyone here. And I want
to explore that unflinchingly. There is a long silence as everyone looks
uncomfortable.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: We are all hurtling toward death.</p>
<p>****: Yet here we are, for the moment, alive. Each of us knowing we
will die; each of us secretly believing we won’t. Nobody says anything
for a long moment.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: It’s brilliant. It’s brilliant. It’s
everything. It’s Karamazov.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Dear diary. Germany is wonderful! So many
friends here. My new dads are great and handsome. And brilliant
directors of theater. Caden grimaces in pain for a moment. His mouth
bleeds. He dials the phone.</p>
<p><strong>hazel’s answering machine</strong>: It’s Hazel. Leave a
message or don’t. Your dime.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Hi. I haven’t heard from you so I thought I’d
say hi. Hi, Hazel! He giggles crazily, coughs, then hangs up,
embarrassed, grimaces once more, then dials again.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>cadenclaire</strong>: Hi, Claire, it’s Caden.Hi! I was just
thinking about you!</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Yeah? Um, I was calling to say hi, chat about
today maybe.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Hi! Here you are, on my phone!</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Yeah. Do you maybe want to get a drink or
something? It’s late so –</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Yeah! Yeah yeah yeah!</p>
<p><strong>hazelderek</strong>: I’m just asking. Stop!</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: You are so obnoxious!</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: You’re so obnoxious.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Yeah, well, you find it awfully charming. My
obnoxiousity.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Obnoxiousity is not a word.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: You don’t want to cross me.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Don’t I?</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: No. Because you like me so much.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: True. I like your obnoxiousity.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: And my use of the word “obnoxiousity.”</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Yes. You’re delicious in your acquiescence.
Claire enters, looks for Caden. She spots Hazel first.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Hi, Claire.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Hi…!</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Hazel.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Of course. Hazel. I knew that! Duh! The box
office.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Yes, I’m the box office.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: How are you?</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Wonderful! You?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Fine, thanks. I was supposed to meet Caden
here. You know Mr. Cotard, right?</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Yes, I recall Mr. Cotard. Hazel looks around
now, too. Both spot Caden at the same time. He smiles and waves and
approaches.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Oh, hey.</p>
<p><strong>hazelclaire</strong>: Hi, Caden. Hi, Caden.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Hi, Hazel. Hi, Claire.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: This is Derek.</p>
<p><strong>cadenclaire</strong>: Hi, Derek. Hi, Derek.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Hi, Derek.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: How’s everything, Haze… ul?</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Great, Cade. En.</p>
<p><strong>cadenclaire</strong>: Good. It’s good to see you. Reunion
night! How lovely!</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>hazelcaden</strong>: So –We’ll leave you be.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Yeah, okay. Thanks. Derek and I –</p>
<p><strong>cadenhazel</strong>: No, of course. It was nice Take care.
seeing you. Caden and Claire go to Caden’s booth.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: That was awkward.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Yeah, I guess. Caden steals glances at Hazel,
chatting animatedly, throughout his conversation with Claire. He hears
occasional snippets.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Let’s talk about our project. I’m so excited
about it.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Really? Why?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I just think it’s… brave. I feel like I’m
going to be part of a revolution. I keep thinking Artaud. I keep
thinking Krapp’s Last Tape. Grotowski, for Christ’s sake!</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I don’t know what I’m doing.</p>
<p><strong>claire hazel</strong>: But that’s what’s so … cryptology…
refreshing. I mean, how much prepackaged …</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: … theater can we take as a country? Y’know?
Knowing that you don’t know is the first and most essential step to
knowing. Y’know?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>claire hazel</strong>: I’m proud of you.Ptolemy was the first
to divide the day into 24…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: So tell me what you want from me?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Hmm?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: From my character.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Oh. Well, we’ll build it over time together.
Find a real person, maybe, to model it after.</p>
<p><strong>claire hazel</strong>: That sounds fun. …hairstyle called a
beaver tail. It’s a loop of hair…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: That Hazel girl is kind of interesting,
maybe. As a model.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Um, yeah. Something to think about. Sure.
Although –</p>
<p><strong>claire caden</strong>: Y’know, why is she still I don’t know.
Probably not working in a box office at that interesting. her age?</p>
<p><strong>claire caden</strong>: There’s got to be a storyYeah. Could
be. We’ll talk there. Did she want to be an about it. actress but lacked
confidence? You seem distracted.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: No. I have these health issues.</p>
<p><strong>claire hazel</strong>: It’s late. … and the jet, it exploded,
and she was sent plummeting.</p>
<p><strong>caden claire</strong>: Um…Well, we can talk more tomorrow
maybe.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p>****: When I get tired I have to remember to breathe. It’s a new
thing. My autonomic functions are failing.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Poor darling. It’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>cadenclaire</strong>: I’m just … Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh.
Claire leads Caden past Hazel and Derek, deep in conversation, heads
close together.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Whitrow says, “If a mind is regarded to be a
memory-based process of integration…”</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: My mother died last night.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: My God. I’m so sorry. What are you doing
out?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Ugh, I couldn’t deal with my sisters. It’s
like living in a Heironymous Bosch painting.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Oh. I see. Well, um, What happened to your
mother, if I could ask? I mean, God, that’s an awful thing to ask. I’m
sorry. I don’t mean to – It’s just that, I’m –</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Oh, this is me. No, it’s okay. She fell.
Slipped in her bathroom. Hit her head. It actually split in half.
Horrible. They stop at a small hatchback with a cow painted on it.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: In half?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Yes. Well, it was nice meeting you. Did I
say “meeting”? Ugh, I’m such an idiot.</p>
<p><strong>caden claire</strong>: Slip of the tongue is all.Freudian
slip.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I don’t know how it’s Freudian.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Y’know. Like “meet”? To meet?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Oh. Well, I’m sorry about your mother. In
half?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: It’s okay. It’s life. It’s – Claire’s face
contorts into a horrifying, paralyzed grimace.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: What is it? What? She weeps silently, with
gaping mouth. Caden awkwardly embraces her. She remains stiff.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Do you want me to drive you home? She shakes
her head “no” over and over. Then she looks in at her reflection in the
car window.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Sometimes when I cry, I watch myself so I
can remember how it looks for future roles. It’s horrible. I hate
myself.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: It’s okay. Everyone does that. It’s – is
there anything I can do?</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: …there she met Ralph Keene. They fell in
love, married, and soon their first child, Claire was born. The
minister’s voice goes under.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I used to be a baby.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I’m so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I was a baby girl with hair of spun gold,
the prettiest baby anyone had ever seen. One day the townsfolk, who were
jealous of my beauty, decided to steal me away.</p>
<p><strong>clairecaden</strong>: There was a knock at theGod, you’re
beautiful. door.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: It was a bearded old man. Caden can hold out
no longer. He kisses her. They fall back on the bed. He kisses her all
over as she continues to tell the story. Her voice becomes irresistibly
melodious.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: He said to me, “young lady, I have in my
satchel a ring. Whomever possesses it will receive all the magic of the
woodland sprites.”</p>
<p><strong>caden claire</strong>: lolling, breathing her”You can have
this ring if you promise me one thing.” I have to fuck you. I
have”Anything,” I whispered in to. his ear. Caden and Claire are having
sex now.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: He said, “There is one more thing. You must
never tell anyone what you promised me. If you do, you will die.”</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: So I used my new power to kill all the
townsfolk. Horrible, humiliating deaths. I was reunited with my family.
And I lived happily ever after, doing only good with my new powers.
Caden cries and rests his head on her thigh.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Why are you crying, honey?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I’m so in love with you. Claire smiles,
strokes his hair.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I have problems, Claire. I’m still attached
to my wife. I have also – I have also – feelings for Hazel.</p>
<p>****: Really? Hazel? Oh. Really? Our Hazel? That’s really
interesting. I must’ve picked that up unconsciously. Wow. Boy. Gosh.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I’ve left them behind. I’ve gone somewhere
without them. I’m guilty of so much.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: It’s okay. We’ll be fine. You’re with me
now. We’ll be good.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: There will be no other before you.</p>
<p><strong>davis claire</strong>: I’d like to buy a ticket. Okay.
That’ll be forty dollars.</p>
<p><strong>davis claire</strong>: Okay. Forty dollars it is.Okay. Here’s
your ticket.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Okay, hold it. We’re not really – I think we
need to work on your characters individually. We need to investigate, to
really discover the essence of each being. Davis, I’ll start with you.
Caden walks off with Davis. Claire seethes.</p>
<p><strong>night</strong>: Claire chops vegetables. Caden feeds a baby.
Christmas decorations are up.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Davis, I’ll start with you. There’s a
difference between favoring me and pretending we’ve never met. I mean,
we had Ariel, I think people know we’ve fucked.</p>
<p><strong>caden claire</strong>: That’s not the point. Apparently not.
I would’ve guessed you were sleeping with Davis.</p>
<p><strong>caden claire</strong>: We’ll talk about your Maybe you are. I
just want character after we get Arielto feel what we used to feel. to
bed. Okay? Y’know?</p>
<p><strong>night</strong>: Claire sits on the bed and seems almost in a
trance. She looks haggard and her cheeks are tear-stained.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: She’s 36. Works in a theater box office. She
had acting aspirations but lacked the confidence to pursue them. Her
life is passing by. She is alone. She’s old and ugly –</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I think you should pick another subject.
Other than Hazel.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Sacred ground?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: No. It’s just. I don’t feel like there’s
enough there. Claire thinks for a moment.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I suppose not. She is limited. Okay. There’s
this single mother who lives downstairs. I find her really deep and
sad.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I’m 42. I have a small child and no husband.
I work long hours as a cashier at a mini-mart. Sometimes I worry my
child will not even recognize me when I come home – Claire cries like
she did when her mother died. Ariel cries.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Check on her. Please, sweetie. I’m arriving
at something.</p>
<p><strong>night</strong>: Ariel sleeps in a crib in the corner of the
living room. Caden sits on a tiny chair, thumbing through a
magazine.</p>
<p><strong>79continued:79</strong>: Claire weeps off-screen. Caden sees
an article entitled “Flower Girl”, featuring a photo of a naked Olive,
smiling, her body covered from neck to ankle in tattoos of flowers. The
article begins, “Ten year old Olive Wittgart of Berlin is the first
child in human history with a full body tattoo…” Caden stares in
disbelief. Claire pokes her head in. Her eyes are red.</p>
<p><strong>clairecaden</strong>: Caden, I’ve made aI have to go find my
breakthrough. This woman is daughter. beautiful. I’ve got –</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Your daughter is right here.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: My real daughter.</p>
<p><strong>clairecaden</strong>: What? My first daughter. Olive. I’ve
got to find her.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Please don’t do this to us.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: She’s tattooed!</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Everyone’s tattooed!</p>
<p><strong>caden claire</strong>: I’ve never seen that before.You have
responsibilities.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I’ll be quick. I’ll do it quick.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Everyone’s tattooed. Please.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Redundancy is fluid. Life moves to the south.
There is only the now.</p>
<p><strong>madeline</strong>: Hi. He sees Madeline sitting across the
aisle. She is different, sexier in make-up and a tight dress.</p>
<p><strong>madeline</strong>: When you cancelled, it freed me up. So I’m
traveling, too! Yippee!</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I’m not sure I’m getting the book.</p>
<p><strong>madeline</strong>: But it’s getting you. You’re almost
non-recognizable now. Madeline spreads her legs a bit and smiles at
Caden. He nervously grins, goes back to his book. He reads:</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I offer my flower to you and you deny it.
This book is over. He turns the page. Blank. The rest of the book is
blank. He looks over at Madeline. She is watching a movie.</p>
<p><strong>caden german woman</strong>: I don’t speak German. I was -
Yes yes. I may help you, -Mister?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I’m looking for Adele Cotard.</p>
<p><strong>german woman</strong>: Yes. We must not give addresses or
other personal informations.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I’m her husband.</p>
<p><strong>german woman</strong>: No. You are not her husbands, which is
named Gunther und Heinz.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: You’re here, too?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: I live with Adele and Olive and Gunther und
Heinz and Uschi and Britt. I’m everyone’s nanny.</p>
<p><strong>cadenmaria</strong>: I want to see my daughter. They sent
me.</p>
<p><strong>cadenmaria</strong>: They? And who the fuck are They decided
it’s not time to Uschi and Britt? see you yet.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Maria, I can’t believe Adele got her tattooed
like that. I mean –</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: I did that. Olive’s my project.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: She’s a four year old!</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: She’s almost over eleven now. She’s my muse.
I love her. Caden stares at her for a moment, then lunges. He punches
her repeatedly as she tries to get away. She throws a punch which
connects with the side of his head and knocks him down. She hurries
off.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: What’d you do to my family? What’d you do to
my daughter?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Screw you, Caden. Faggot! FAGGOT! She turns
down an alley. Caden, a half-block behind, hurries to the alley. She’s
gone. He walks through, looking for her. It’s dark. Trash cans and
garbage. He spots an unopened box next to the trash. It’s pink with a
picture of a nose on it. Caden drops to his knees and weeps. No tears
come out. His eyes are dry and red. He pulls a vial of artificial tears
from his pockets and moistens his eyes. Suddenly his breathing becomes
wildly erratic.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Death comes faster than you think.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Yeah, I want to bring my production to New
York. To get it seen. By people, you know, who matter. The sooner the
better.</p>
<p><strong>realtor</strong>: Well, this theater is centrally located.
Heart of the theater district. So… great for plays.</p>
<p><strong>caden realtor</strong>: Yeah?Yeah. Very much so.</p>
<p><strong>realtor</strong>: Lots of room for seats over here.</p>
<p><strong>patient</strong>: And then he said he couldn’t see me
anymore. Just like that. I don’t understand. I… I mean, he just told me
two days before how much he loves me. Everything’s spinning out of
control. He stops at Claire’s “apartment.” She is ironing and watching a
daytime soap, which is a closed-circuit TV. The actors in the soap are
across the warehouse in another apartment.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Dr. Williams, that was your last patient
for the day.</p>
<p><strong>dr. williams</strong>: Jennifer, let’s stop this charade.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I don’t know what you’re talking about,
Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>dr. williams</strong>: The chemistry between us is palpable.
You and I both know that.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Dennis… I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>dr. williams</strong>: Why not? It’s the way God made us.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I can’t because Jerry came back last
night.</p>
<p><strong>dr. williams</strong>: Jerry, but he’s dead. I’m certain of
that because…</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Because what? Because what, Dennis?</p>
<p><strong>dr. williams</strong>: Because I’m certain, that’s all. Ariel
sits in a highchair and plays with a bowl of Cheerios. She is about two
and a half.</p>
<p><strong>arielcaden</strong>: Daddy! Daddy is mine!Daddy can’t play
now, honey.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Daddy doesn’t live with us anymore, baby. He
had to find himself. Claire shoots daggers at Caden and goes back to
ironing. Nearby, Tom and Davis rehearse their scene in another
“apartment.”</p>
<p><strong>davis</strong>: I like it but it’s a little tight in the toe.
Don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: No. It’s right. This is how they’re supposed to
fit. They’re French.</p>
<p><strong>davis</strong>: Oh. French, huh? Okay.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: I can’t argue with further testing.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Ok, you’re a doctor, right? Am I dying? Can
you tell me that?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: No, you can’t tell me?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: I can’t tell you.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: You can’t tell me if you can’t tell me?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Caden! I was wondering if I was going to bump
into you! She gives him a hug, notices his shaking leg.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: What are you doing here? You look great.</p>
<p><strong>hazelcaden</strong>: Oh, thanks. You… I –New haircut?</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Um, yeah. For a while now.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: What are you doing in New York?</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Oh. Iâ€™m here with Derek and the boys.
Mini-vacation! You know.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: The boys?</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Yeah. I thought you knew.</p>
<p><strong>cadenhazel</strong>: Ah. Congratulations. Yeah. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: How old?</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Five. Twins. Robert and Daniel and Allan.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Ah. Yes.</p>
<p>****: Nice names. Where are they?</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Oh. Derek took them to Natural History. So I
could shop.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Ah.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Nice to see you, Caden. How are things?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Yâ€™know. I was with Claire. We have a
daughter, but we’re separated now. How about with you?</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Good. The kids are wonderful. I have a great
job at Lens Shapers.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Great. You wear a lab coat?</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Itâ€™s so good to see you. I should run. I
want to get some shopping in. Weâ€™re meeting back at the hotel at
three. Then sushi!</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Okay. Good seeing you, Hazel. Hazel smiles
and waves and turns to head into the store. Caden watches after her.</p>
<p><strong>olive’s voice</strong>: How I love Maria! She is so much more
of a father than Caden ever was, with his drinking and unfortunate body
odor and rotting teeth. I could only loathe him and perhaps pity him.
But Maria! Caden blots his sopping brow and gums, sniffs under his
arms.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: It’s me.</p>
<p><strong>ariel claire</strong>: Daddy, Daddy! What, Caden?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I want to come back. I want to take care of
you and Olive. Ariel. There’s silence then the door opens. Claire is
crying.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I just want you to love us. Caden hugs her.
Ariel hugs Caden’s good leg.</p>
<p><strong>ariel</strong>: Why does you have a canes, Daddy?</p>
<p><strong>continued: 97 97</strong>: The phone rings. Claire cranes her
neck and looks at the clock. The gaunt man and Ariel both step out of
view.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: It’s 3:30. For crying out fuck. Caden
answers the phone.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Hello? What’s wrong? Okay. Okay. Caden hangs
up. Claire kisses Caden’s neck.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: My father died.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Oh, baby.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: His body was riddled with cancer. He didn’t
even know. He went in because his finger hurt.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: It’s okay, baby. It’s going to be okay. Let
me make you feel better. Claire begins kissing her way down Caden’s
chest.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: They said he suffered horribly. That he
called out for me right before he died. They said he said he regretted
his life. They said he said a lot of things. Too many to recount. They
said it was the longest and saddest deathbed speech any of them had ever
heard.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: There was so little left of him. They had to
fill the coffin with cotton balls to keep him from rattling around.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Excuse me, I have to use the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>later</strong>: Caden dials his cell phone.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Caden?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I had to talk to you. My father died.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Oh no. Oh, Caden. I’m so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>cadenhazel</strong>: Thanks. I know.Are you at your
mom’s?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Yeah. With Claire and Ariel.</p>
<p><strong>hazelcaden</strong>: Oh. I see. I’m back with Claire.
Pause.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Yes, I got that.</p>
<p><strong>cadenhazel</strong>: I’m sorry. What are you sorry about?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I don’t know. You got quiet. I thought I
should say something.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: You thought you should say something. That’s
lovely. That’s what makes our relationship so special. The
obligation.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: What am I supposed to do, Hazel? I have a kid
with her. You have twins with Derek. Three twins. It’s confusing!</p>
<p><strong>hazel caden</strong>: You’re not supposed to do I really miss
you. anything.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Yeah, I guess that’s what happens when you
have a kid with somebody else. You having sex with her?</p>
<p><strong>caden hazel</strong>: Hazel…I’m asking you a question. Did
you have sex with her now that you’re back together?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Yes. Of course. I mean, what –</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: I have to go. I’m sorry about your dad.
That’s awful news.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Hazel, please, I can’t bear it if you go.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: I have to. I’m going out. I have to get
ready. Everything’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I need to use a cane now.</p>
<p>****: Okay. Take care. Hazel hangs up. Caden sits there.</p>
<p><strong>olive’s german voice</strong>: Today I felt a wetness between
my legs. Maria explained to me now I am a woman. And being a woman is
wonderful with Maria to guide me.</p>
<p><strong>107 int dark small room - night 107</strong>: Caden sits by
himself in a cramped space. A light switches on behind scarred
Plexiglas. Olive dances naked. Caden tries to get her attention by
banging on the glass but she can’t see him. A bouncer enters and beats
Caden up.</p>
<p><strong>clairecaden</strong>: Get out of bed. I’m depressed.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: The cry of the North American Caden.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I’d just like a little sympathy.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I’ll save my sympathy for the eighty million
people with avian flu, the Tsunami victims in Puerto Rico, the countless
millennia dead from… how fucked it all is.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Millennia dead? What? And since when do you
care about anything?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I care every day about things! I care about
us! … Y’know?!</p>
<p><strong>ariel</strong>: Why do Daddy be sad now?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Hazel! Hazel and Derek turn.</p>
<p><strong>hazel caden</strong>: Caden, what are you doing Sorry. Can I
talk to you? here? Please? Hazel kisses Derek, whispers something in his
ear. They share a giggle. Derek waves at Caden and heads into the
burning house. Hazel approaches Caden’s car.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Tell me what to do.</p>
<p><strong>hazel caden</strong>: Caden, everyone has to figure I want
you to look at me like out their own life. Y’know? you used to.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Oh, honey, I can’t anymore.</p>
<p>****: I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I screwed everything up. I don’t have any
courage. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: It’s okay. I’m okay.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I don’t want you to be okay. I mean, I do but
it rips my guts out.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: I’ll always be your friend. I’ll help you
through any way I can.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I’ll help you through, too.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Caden, I’m fine. I have Derek.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I won’t settle for anything less than the
brutal truth. Brutal! Each day I’ll hand you a scrap of paper. It’ll
tell you what happened to you that day. “You felt a lump in your breast.
You looked at your wife and saw a stranger.” Etcetera.</p>
<p><strong>tom caden</strong>: Caden, when are we going to And I’m not
excusing myself get an audience in here?from this either. I will It’s
been seventeen years.have someone play me, to delve into the murky,
cowardly depths of my lonely, fucked-up being. He’ll get notes, too. And
they will correspond to the “notes” I truly get each day from my God.
The actors glance uncomfortably at Claire. She smiles
apologetically.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: They fired me. I caused an outbreak of
conjunctivitis. I didn’t wash my hands. I had pink eye hands! Pink
hands!</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Oh God.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: I didn’t wash my hands! I’m a stupid cow! I
don’t have anything to show for being on this planet. And this fucking
private Christian school is killing us. It’s not cheap. It’s Derek’s
thing. I don’t believe in that shit. Y’know? Try to be a good person.
That’s all there is. I’m sorry. I’m talking too much. Do you have
anything for me, Caden?</p>
<p><strong>caden hazel</strong>: Um, I have an assistant,Please, Caden.
Everything is Hazel. And there’s no box falling apart. I miss you.
office yet. There are problems at home. I’m worthless. I’m fat. What am
I going to do? Nobody laughs at my jokes the way you did.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Sammy Barnathan? Sammy Barnathan stands. He
is the gaunt man we’ve seen following Caden. Hazel leads him to Caden.
Caden stands.</p>
<p><strong>hazel sammy</strong>: This is Sammy Barnathan.I don’t have a
resume or picture. I’ve never worked as an actor.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Good. Tell me why you’re here.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: I’ve been following you for twenty years. So
I knew about this audition. Because I follow you. Caden, hiding is
nervousness, nods.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: I’ve learned everything about you by
following you. Hire me and you will see who you truly are. Caden stares
at Sammy. Sammy stares back. There’s fear in Caden’s eyes but he doesn’t
drop his gaze.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Peek-a-boo. Sammy transforms effortlessly
into Caden.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Okay, Hazel, I don’t think we need to talk to
anyone else. This guy has me down. I’m going to cast him right now. Then
maybe you and I can get a drink and we can try to figure out this thing
between us. Why I cried. I’ve never felt about anyone the way I feel
about you. I want to fuck you until we merge into a Chimera.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: A mythical beast with penis and vagina
eternally fused, two pair of eyes that look only at each other, lips
ever touching and one voice that whispers to itself.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Yes, okay. You’ve got the part. Sammy nods
and exits. Hazel follows him with her eyes.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: He’s good, Caden.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Please don’t fall in love with him.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: I only have eyes for you, dear.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: I’ve never seen your shit gray.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: It’s new. Sammy jots a note. Caden places his
backpack on a sink. He looks at himself in the mirror, stalling.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: I know it’s pill time. You don’t need to hide
from me. Caden opens his pack and pulls out a baggie full of pills. He
takes them, one-by-one. Sammy watches and counts. When it’s over, he
speaks.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: You’re missing your Fosonex.</p>
<p><strong>caden sammy</strong>: No. Check your bag. Caden pulls out
books and notebooks and a sweater. The pill falls out of the sweater
onto the grimy floor.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Fosonex, 2.5 mg. Caden picks the pill up off
the floor. It’s got grime on it.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Swallow it anyway. It’s important. Go on,
sweetie. Caden looks at Sammy and swallows the pill.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Good boy.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: When is it opening?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: When it’s ready.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: We need to get in. It’s bad out here. They move
on, passing poor people waiting in line for food distributed from a
military truck. There are sick people being herded into a scary bus
marked “Fun Land.” The guards wear surgical masks.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I was thinking of calling it Simulacrum. What
do you think?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I don’t know what it means.</p>
<p><strong>ariel</strong>: Can me have a nickel if I doesn’t play with
my pee-pee no more? A hovercraft glides down the street with
searchlights.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: How about The Flawed Light of Love and
Grief?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I’m not sure. Sammy jots something in his
book.</p>
<p><strong>later</strong>: Caden and Sammy watch the city: fires in the
distance. Human wailing. Christmas decorations in windows across the
way. Occasional explosions. Claire pokes her head out.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I’m going to work in my journal. You guys
need anything?</p>
<p><strong>cadensammy</strong>: No, thanks.No, thanks, Claire.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Claire? I want you to drop your study of
Mrs. Kranstein.</p>
<p><strong>claire caden</strong>: Caden – I want you to play yourself.
Sammy’s going to move into your apartment set as me.</p>
<p><strong>claire caden</strong>: It’s just that I’ve made suchAs the
vision reveals itself, enormous strides as Jocelynwe all have to be
willing to and – adapt, honey.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: It’d be my honor to play your husband,
Claire. You’re an amazing actress. I saw you in Bernarda Alba last year
at The Roundabout.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Yeah? That was a fun play. Emotionally
tough, but fucking fulfilling.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: And I loved working with so many strong
female actresses. Ugh, Lorca’s a genius. Okay. I’m going to start
thinking about myself. Claire exits.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Start, huh? Caden chuckles.</p>
<p>****: Why did we leave Adele, Caden?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: She left us. You know that better than
anyone. Except me.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Amazing artist though. The best living
artist. There’s no one who stares the truth in the face like she does. A
sweet pussy, too. Caden looks at Sammy, confused.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: How do you know that?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Oh. I read it.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Anyway, I don’t know where she is. A strange
dirigible flies very low overhead.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Maybe she’s got a sublet in New York. Maybe
the Met’s doing a retrospective. Maybe, baby. He hands Caden a slip of
paper.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Why are you giving this to me?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: I want to follow you there and see how you
lose even more of yourself. Research. For the part. Partner.</p>
<p><strong>faint faraway voice</strong>: Hold it. Hold it, please. Caden
reaches for the “door open” button but doesn’t press it. The doors close
and the elevator continues its shaky ascent. The doors open on 31 and
Caden exits.</p>
<p><strong>old person</strong>: I asked you to hold the door.</p>
<p><strong>caden old person</strong>: I’m sorry. I pressed it, butYou
didn’t press it. I think it was too late. Caden continues to walk down
the hall. The old person walks behind him. Caden looks behind him and
smiles awkwardly.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Have a good night. He picks up his pace,
trying to be casual about it. He arrives at 31Y, glances over and sees
the old person knocking feebly on a door down the hall.</p>
<p><strong>old person</strong>: Frances, I need to go to the clinic.
Something’s terribly wrong with my nose. Caden knocks on 31Y. No answer.
He knocks again. Down the hall, the door opens and another old person
steps out into the hall. This person examines the first old person’s
nose.</p>
<p><strong>old person #2</strong>: Oh yes. I see. Old Person #2 squints
over at Caden.</p>
<p><strong>old person #2</strong>: Are you Ellen? Ellen?!</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: What?</p>
<p>****: Are you Ellen Bascomb? I’m to give the key to 31Y to Ellen
Bascomb.</p>
<p>****: Yes, I’m Ellen. Old Person #2 fishes a key out of the overcoat
pocket.</p>
<p><strong>old person #2</strong>: She said you should just go in and
get started. She said, don’t forget to change the sheets.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Ok. Thank you. Old Person #2 turns and heads
back down the hall to Old Person #1, whose nose has started to
bleed.</p>
<p><strong>old person #2</strong>: Oh dear. Caden enters the
apartment.</p>
<p><strong>adele’s voice</strong>: Hi Ellen. Be a doll and do the sheets
and whatever is in the hamper. Your money is under the toaster. Kisses,
Adele. ps. bag of stuff in bedroom closet for Goodwill. Take what you
want.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I went for a walk. I had to think.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: All night? You smell weird. Are you wearing
lipstick?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: No! What do I smell like? Like bad? Like an
old person?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I don’t know. Like mold? I don’t know. Like
mold and … cleaning products? Like you’re menstruating? I don’t
know!</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I don’t like that guy you got to play
you.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: You don’t like Sammy? Why? I think he’s
good.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I think you need to fire him. Caden hands
her a scrap of paper.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Oh, fuck you. I’m forty-five years old. I
don’t want to do this shit anymore.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: I’m not firing him, Claire. He’s the best
thing in the show. Next to you.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: He’s coming on to me. He’s feeling my ass
during rehearsal.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: He’s your husband. Claire turns to the real
Caden and screams.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: He’s not my Godamn husband! You are! What is
wrong with you? The actor underneath them pounds on his ceiling.</p>
<p><strong>caden sammy</strong>: Good, Jimmy! It’s for the play. We’re
getting at something real here.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Ugh! I’m going to rehearsal. She grabs her
coat, tosses the note into the trash, and storms out and down the
stairs.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: That’s great, you guys. Sammy sits at the
table and starts to write on scraps of paper. Hazel hovers behind him,
watching.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Beautiful, Sammy. Caden leaves the set and
steps onto his platform.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Caden, time out?</p>
<p><strong>cadensammy</strong>: What’s up? I feel we need a Hazel in
here. There’s a whole side of Caden I’m not able to explore without a
Hazel. Caden looks over at Hazel. Claire watches Caden from the street
corner.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I guess, yeah. Claire walks off in a
huff.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: I get to be a character? Hooray!</p>
<p><strong>old person</strong>: Hello, Ellen.</p>
<p><strong>132continued: 132</strong>: Caden nods. They continue the
ride in silence.</p>
<p><strong>adele’s voice</strong>: Hi Ellen. Crackerjack job last night!
Would you do sheets again? We had quite a fuck last night and it’s musky
and gross. Kisses, A. Caden smells the sheets, strips the bed.</p>
<p><strong>caden’s voice</strong>: Hi Adele. Relined the cabinets. Just
wanted to let you know I won a MacArthur Grant and I’m mounting a play,
which I think is going to be pure and truthful. Best – Caden hesitates
for a moment, then signs it “Ellen.”</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Caden, what are you doing at night? I have a
right to fucking know.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: I’ve been going to Adele’s place. And
cleaning it. Long pause. Caden rubs his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Do you know what I’ve given up for you? For
this. For you. For you.</p>
<p><strong>sammy claire</strong>: I’m sorry.I – I thought I wanted to be
just a working stage actress. But, y’know, I’m watching all the young
girls crowding me out and it’s – There’s a knock on the door. Sammy just
stands there.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Get the door. Please. Just… Sammy opens it.
Tammy, playing Hazel, stands there.</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: Uh-oh. This looks serious. Am I
interrupting?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: What’s going on, Hazel?</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: Just wanted to tell you the girl playing me
is able to start today.</p>
<p><strong>sammy claire</strong>: Oh, good. That’s good.That’s all we
need around here, two Hazels.</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: Okay. I’ll take that as my cue. Tammy closes
the door and leaves.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Maybe you can clean her toilet.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Maybe I will.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: It’s over, Caden.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Claire, no.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I’m not talking to you. Claire turns to
Caden.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I didn’t say I was going to clean Hazel’s
toilet. He did.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: But you thought it. There’s a silence. Hazel
watches Caden closely.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I thought it. But I didn’t say it. Claire
packs up her stuff.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I got an offer to do Needleman in a Haystack
and I’m going to take it. I want you out of the apartment. The real one.
You can keep this one. Claire heads down the stairs.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Jesus. Claire! Please!</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Already put out a call for a Claire
replacement. Would you really clean my bathroom?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: God, Caden, it’s all so fucked.</p>
<p><strong>137 continued:137</strong>: a woman weeping over the grave of
a child; a man raping a woman. He comes to a wall titled: “Women I
Love.” He sees a self-portrait of Adele, a portrait of Maria, a portrait
of Olive, naked and covered in tattoos. Then he comes to a portrait
entitled “Ellen Bascomb.” He steps back for a second, unable to look.
The people behind him are impatient. Finally he flips the glasses and
studies the painting. Ellen appears to be a chubby, 40 year old white
woman, her mousy brown hair tied back in a kerchief. She is naked and
spreading her vulva for the viewer. She has a kind face and what appears
to be an appendectomy scar.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Oh, Needleman, you had such potential. But
Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™m going to have to move on.</p>
<p><strong>actor</strong>: Just like that? You donâ€™t give a guy even a
chance?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Iâ€™m not a chance-giving girl. Iâ€™m a
fun-loving girl. Remember?</p>
<p><strong>actor</strong>: I try to be fun-loving. See? Needleman makes
a funny face. Reba doesnâ€™t react.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: My analyst says you have complexes.</p>
<p><strong>actor</strong>: Once you enjoyed Needlemanâ€™s complexes.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Thatâ€™s before my analyst taught me that my
enjoyment of them was a sign of my suppressed non- enjoymnent of
them.</p>
<p><strong>actor</strong>: I hate your analyst.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: She told me your hatred of her is a sign of
your latent homosexuality.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: This is the end of my stuff.</p>
<p><strong>claireactor</strong>: Bye.Bye. Caden heads out the apartment
door.</p>
<p><strong>continuous</strong>: Caden enters the apartment next door and
closes the door.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: This is a lie! Caden paces. The actors stop
what they’re doing, sit with their legs dangling off the edge of their
apartments, wait for instructions. Caden limps off to the set designer’s
office.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Wall it up.</p>
<p><strong>adele’s voice</strong>: Good for you with your grant! Listen,
I fixed up the walk-in as a sort of bedroom if you want. We’d love to
have you and you wouldn’t have to schlep all the way to Queens. Just a
thought. Kisses.</p>
<p><strong>continuous</strong>: Eventually Sammy arrives at a warehouse
that looks exactly like the warehouse they are in. He enters.</p>
<p><strong>continuous</strong>: Inside it looks exactly like the
warehouse, including a duplicate city set. Sammy hands little scraps of
paper to people, then dumps his pack on the table where Tammy sits.
Hazel and Caden watch.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Morning, Haze.</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: Hi, Caden. How was your night?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Okay. Yours?</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: Eh. Philip was colicky. I was up all night.
Caden looks over at Hazel for confirmation. She nods, slightly freaked
out.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Sorry. Everybody here?</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: Sammy’s not here. Jimmy called and said
there’s some subway problem. Jimmy rushes into the warehouse.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry.</p>
<p>****: Hi, Hazel.</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: Hi, Sammy.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Sammy likes you. Caden looks at Hazel. She
nods.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Hazel, could you get everyone situated? I
need to speak to Will about some new sets. Sammy pulls some Polaroids
out of his backpack.</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: Yeah. We’ll take it from June 9th? Sammy
nods, heads toward the set designer’s office.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Oh, shit. I need to do that, too. Haze, keep
an eye on things?</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Yup. June 9th? Caden nods, rushes out the
door of the warehouse set.</p>
<p><strong>- 2031 - continuous</strong>: Caden finds Will up on some
scaffolding, working on the set.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Will, I need you to build this. Caden hands
Will shots of the exterior and interiors of Adele’s building and of
apartment 31Y.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Hazel, what do you think of this title:
Unknown, Unkissed, and Lost?</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Eh. Caden this is Millicent Weems.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Hi, Millicent. Have a seat. How are you at
cleaning?</p>
<p>****: I’m very, very good at it.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Because this part requires a lot of it. You’d
play a cleaning lady.</p>
<p><strong>millicent</strong>: I played Egga the cleaning lady in Hedda
Gabler at the Roundabout.</p>
<p><strong>cadenmillicent</strong>: Great. Okay. And Mrs. Dobson in
Scrub-a- Dub at the Pantages.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: You’re weirdly close to what I’ve visualized
for this character.</p>
<p><strong>millicent</strong>: Glad to be weirdly close. Millicent and
Caden study each other.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Good work, everyone. Nobody acknowledges
him.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Where’re Sammy and Hazel? Tammy jerks her
head to the left. Caden sees that Sammy has Hazel with her back against
a wall. They are talking intimately. Caden approaches.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Hey, Sammy, what are you doing? Sammy and
Hazel look over casually.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Hi, Caden. I’m being you. You like Hazel; I
like Hazel.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: This Hazel doesn’t exist for you. If you want
to like a Hazel, like that one. Caden points indicates Tammy. Sammy
squints over.</p>
<p><strong>tammyhazel</strong>: That’s what I tried to tellAw, no harm,
no foul, Caden. him! It’s Equity break anyway.</p>
<p>****: Ten minutes, everybody! The actors playing the people on the
street immediately stop what they’re doing. Actors pour from apartment
buildings and shops, lighting cigarettes and talking on cell phones.
Sammy goes off.</p>
<p><strong>cadenhazel</strong>: Hazel. What?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: You don’t like him, do you?</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Kind of. He reminds me of you.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I’m me. You don’t need someone to remind you
of me.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Don’t worry, Caden. I like you more. I do.
Sammy’s just fun.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I’m fun.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Oh, sweetie. No, you’re not. Caden’s cell
phone rings. He answers it.</p>
<p><strong>caden voice</strong>: Yes?Is this Caden Cotard?</p>
<p><strong>caden voice</strong>: Yes.This is Officer Mark Mellman of
Schnectady P.D.</p>
<p><strong>caden voice</strong>: Yes?I’m sorry to inform you, your
mother has been the victim of a home invasion.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Was my father standing with us?</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: I don’t know what he looks like.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: He’s dead. He looks dead, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: Probably wasn’t him then.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: A little moustache? She shrugs.</p>
<p><strong>cade</strong>: Anyway, Thanks for coming with me.</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I asked Hazel but she was busy tonight and
you’re the next best thing. I mean, it isn’t that you’re the next best
thing but because you play her, it feels comforting. Does that make
sense? Although the thing is offstage you’re nothing like her. You play
her very well though. Did Hazel mention what she was doing tonight
because I called her house before we left and her husband said she
wasn’t going to be back till late and I thought that was weird because
she told me Philip was sick.</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: She’s going to dinner with Sammy.</p>
<p>****: That’s interesting.</p>
<p><strong>tammycaden</strong>: He’s supposed to like me.I’ll have
another talk with him. Can you excuse me. I need to use the bathroom.
Caden gets up and turns to leave.</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: Don’t forget your phone.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Thank you, Yammy. Caden takes the phone and
limps off.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Hey. What you up to?</p>
<p><strong>hazel’s voice</strong>: In my car. Heading to dinner with
Sammy.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Why didn’t you tell me that before?</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Caden. I don’t want to say things that are
going to make you sad.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: It mostly makes me sad that it doesn’t make
you sad.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: You want me to be sad that someone’s taking
me out to dinner? I don’t know how to do that.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I want you to be sad that we had something
really special and it’s going away!</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: It just happened, Caden. I didn’t plan it.
You were with Claire. This probably isn’t going to go anywhere, sweetie.
I’m still your girl.</p>
<p><strong>cadenhazel’s voice</strong>: Oh, Haze. C’mon. It’s just
dinner. He’s got stories! It just seems fun.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: He has stories about me!</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Caden, I know everything about you and it’s
all adorable. I love you and I always will. So don’t worry. I gotta go,
I’m there. Hazel hangs up. Caden stands there for a minute.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Did you always want to be an actress?</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: Every girl wants to be an actress.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Is that true?</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: I did. So I figure everyone does.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I thought someone would’ve cleaned it up.</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I don’t know! Someone.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: This is my room. You can sleep here.</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: Where will you sleep?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: The living room couch.</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: Don’t you want to sleep with me?</p>
<p><strong>caden tammy</strong>: Um… It’s just sex.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Okay. If you think it’s okay. Tammy laughs,
matter-of-factly gets undressed in front of Caden. He just stands there
uncomfortably.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: How can you be like that?</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: I get undressed every day.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: In front of someone is different.</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: I don’t see why.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Maybe because you have a beautiful body.
Maybe that makes it easier.</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: I suppose it might. Do you want to fuck?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I do. Yes. Um. Do you?</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: It’d be fine. Caden starts to cry.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I’m sorry. I’m very lonely. I don’t know
what’s wrong. I just – I’m sorry. Can you understand? Do you understand
loneliness?</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: Yeah, I mean, I don’t know. I feel okay
mostly. Fucking might help.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: It’s okay. I don’t mind. Take your clothes
off.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: You’re very pretty.</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Sometimes I wish I were pretty like that.</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: You wish you were a chick?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Sometimes I think I might’ve been better at
it.</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: Interesting. It’s kind of a drag in a lot of
ways. You like guys?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: No. No. I like women. I only like women.</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: Well, I’m getting cold. She climbs into
bed.</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: Take off your clothes. Caden does, awkwardly
and shyly. He then stands there naked. Tammy smiles sweetly at him.</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: Pretty Caden.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Thanks. Thank you for saying that.</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: Come to bed, Pretty Caden. Caden turns off
the lights and climbs into the twin bed with Tammy. She looks at his
face, then kisses him.</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: What is attractive? How are attractive people
treated, how do they feel? How do unattractive people feel, how are they
treated? How do attractive people feel about unattractive people, how do
unattractive people feel about attractive people? How do unattractive
people feel about other unattractive people? How do attractive people
feel about other attractive people? How do unattractive men feel about
unattractive women? How do unattractive men feel about attractive women?
How do attractive men feel about unattractive women? How do attractive
women feel about unattractive men? How do old people feel about
attractive people? How do attractive people feel about old people? This
is my study. Caden slows down.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: That’s Hazel’s house. Caden points to the
house with smoke seeping out the windows.</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: Huh. Do you think we should have a Hazel’s
house on the set for me?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Um…</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: It would be verisimilitudinous.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Yeah. I don’t know. I have to speak to the
fire marshal.</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: It would be very verisimilitudinous if you
could.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I think both of you Hazels are going to like
this. Turn off here. Hazel rolls her eyes, drives down an exit ramp.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Hank! Okay! The house begins to smoke.</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: My house! Tammy kisses Caden on the cheek and
runs into the house.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Is there no end to your pussy kissing?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: It’s verisimilitudinous. I’m thinking of that
as a title.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Whatever. I’ve got work to do. Tell your
girlfriend to get out here if she wants a ride back.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: She’s not my girlfriend.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Give it a rest, Caden. I can smell her on
your breath.</p>
<p>****: Tammy! We have to get back.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Jeremy is playing to us. Tell him he simply
needs to talk to Donna. We’ll hear what we hear. Tammy takes down the
note.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Sammy’s explaining too much. Feels
expository. Needs to be shorthand, like, “Jeremy big.” Hazel writes that
down. They all continue down the hall.</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: Caden? Can we stop for a second?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: If Hazel’s in love with Sammy and Caden’s in
love with Hazel, there would be a dramatic confrontation, where Caden
turns to me and says, “It’s obvious he’s a substitute for me.” I think
then Hazel could have a good moment where she cries or gets angry. I’m
not sure which yet, but it feels dramatically sound.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: That didn’t happen, Caden.</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: I think Hazel would do that, Hazel.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: But Hazel hasn’t done it, Tammy.</p>
<p><strong>tammycaden</strong>: Caden? What do you think?I think we
could try it.</p>
<p><strong>tammyhazel</strong>: Great!Fuck. I’m going out for a smoke.
They watch her go. Caden turns back to the others.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Let’s try it. Maybe it could happen at the
director’s table.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Tammy was right. I don’t understand why
you’re with Sammy.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: He’s nice. He’s available. He fucks me
without crying.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: That happened one time! You fucked him?</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Yes! And you and I only fucked one time
that’s why you only cried one time! I give you endless
opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: What do you mean, he’s available? Since when
are you available?</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Derek left. Because of you!</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: When? How come you never told me?</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: I don’t know, Caden. How come a lot of
things? It’s not like we can start fresh, like Sammy and I can. There’s
all this pressure on us. We’re finally both free and there’s all this
fucking pressure.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Fuck. I have to let the actor who plays Derek
go. What is his name?</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: That’s such a romantic response. I’m
touched.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: It’s not my response. It just crossed my
mind. We have enormous budgetary concerns here.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Ugh. Forget it. Derek is played by Joe –</p>
<p><strong>cadenhazel</strong>: Stop, okay. Just stop. I don’t like
Tammy and she’s nothing like me. How can you like her? Joe
Abernathy.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: She looks like you. And –</p>
<p><strong>hazelcaden</strong>: No she does not. – and she offered to
have sex with me. Abernathy?</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Yes. Was it good?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I don’t know. Yeah. It was nice.</p>
<p><strong>hazelcaden</strong>: Ugh. I’m just trying to be honest. It
was nice. Not earth- shattering.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Did you cry?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: You’re making progress.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Okay, I cried a little before. Hazel, you’ve
been part of me forever. Don’t you know that? I breathe your name in
every exhalation.</p>
<p>****: Oh, Caden. Oh, fuck. What the fuck are we doing?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I don’t know. Hazel latches her pinky around
Caden’s. Sammy has been watching the whole thing from behind a pillar.
Caden glances at his watch.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Crap, Ellen’s October 23rd scene!</p>
<p><strong>day</strong>: Millicent, Hazel, and Caden wait in the
elevator. The elevator begins to ascend. Instead of a motor, the sound
of grunting men is heard. The elevator stops short and sways a little
bit.</p>
<p><strong>worker</strong>: Sorry, everybody! Caden pulls off a wall
panel, and sticks his head through.</p>
<p><strong>2032 - same</strong>: Caden looks down the shaft. Five guys
hold the elevator with a rope and pulley system.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: What’s going on, Maurice?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Sorry. We have a couple of new guys on and
we’re not in sync yet.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Okay. Are we good to go?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Yup.</p>
<p><strong>same</strong>: Caden replaces the panel. The elevator
continues its ascent to the sound of grunting men.</p>
<p><strong>- 2032 - continuous</strong>: The elevator doors close.
Millicent, Old Person, Caden, and Hazel walk down the hall. Old Person
knocks on a door, which is opened by Old Person #2 .</p>
<p><strong>old person #2</strong>: Are you Ellen? Ellen?!</p>
<p><strong>millicent</strong>: Shit. Line, please.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: â€œWhat?â€</p>
<p><strong>millicent</strong>: Right. What?</p>
<p><strong>old person #2</strong>: Are you Ellen Bascomb? I’m to give
the key to 31Y to Ellen Bascomb.</p>
<p>****: Yes, I’m Ellen. Old Person #2 fishes a key out of the overcoat
pocket.</p>
<p><strong>old person #2</strong>: She said you should just go in and
get started. She said, don’t forget to change the sheets.</p>
<p><strong>millicent</strong>: Ok. Thank you. Old Person #2 looks back
to Old Person #1, whose nose has started to bleed.</p>
<p><strong>old person #2</strong>: Oh dear. Millicent puts the key in
the lock. It doesnâ€™t turn.</p>
<p><strong>millicent</strong>: Wrong key.</p>
<p><strong>old person #2</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>millicent</strong>: Itâ€™s the wrong key. It doesnâ€™t
turn.</p>
<p><strong>old person #2</strong>: Itâ€™s the one they gave me.</p>
<p><strong>adeleâ€™s voice</strong>: Iâ€™m jumping in the shower. Make
some coffee, would ya?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Did you hear that?</p>
<p><strong>hazelcaden</strong>: What?Did we hire an Adele?</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Iâ€™m sure I wouldâ€™ve remembered that.
No. The shower turns on. Caden grabs the key from Millicent.</p>
<p><strong>millicent</strong>: Caden, youâ€™re breaking the fourth wall.
I get to open the door. He tries to turn the key in the lock. It wonâ€™t
budge.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: This is the wrong key, Sandy.</p>
<p><strong>old person #2</strong>: It isnâ€™t. Caden bangs on the
door.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Adele! Adele, are you in there?</p>
<p><strong>old person #1</strong>: Maybe itâ€™s the wrong key.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Adele?</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Caden, there’s no one in there. You’ve got to
let go of her. She’s not here anymore. I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Yeah, okay. Can we just get the right key, so
we can do the scene? Please, somebody?</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Yeah, we’ll get the right key.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Look familiar?</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Oh my God! It’s an exact replica of the
Tethered Maiden Terrace! Derek and the kids and I had so much fun on
that trip!</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Listen, I built this because I wanted to show
you what happened –</p>
<p>****: After me, Caden, there’s no one left to watch you. They look
up. Sammy stands on the ledge above them.</p>
<p><strong>hazel sammy</strong>: There’s nothing to talk Oh fuck! Sammy,
Just stay about, Hazel! This is not right where you are! I’myour
fault!</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: No fair, Sammy! She wouldn’t see you jump.
She never saw me! You’re not being authentic.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: This is where we part ways. This is
authentic. This is what the real Caden would do. This is what real love
looks like. Sammy leaps. The actors below scatter. Sammy hits hard,
breaks through the fake cement, and is dead. Blood everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I know how to do it now. There are nearly
thirteen million people in the world. Try to imagine that many people!
None of those people is an extra. They’re all the leads of their own
stories. They have to be given their due.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Do you see what I’m saying? Hazel has her
head in her hands. She looks over at Caden, imploringly.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Come over tonight? Please?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: We could get a place together. We could get a
loft.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: God, Caden, that sounds nice. I miss my
daughter. Maybe she could come live with us.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Yeah. I miss Olive. And the other one. The
retarded one.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: I’m a bad person.</p>
<p><strong>caden hazel</strong>: No you’re not. I’m a badI am. I should
never… have person.gone out with Sammy. I was just trying to get to
you.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: You can’t cause someone to kill himself. He
was troubled.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: I’m so ashamed of myself. Caden walks over to
her and touches her shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Oh, Caden. I wish we had this when we were
young. And all the years in between. So many years, so fast.</p>
<p>****: What did we do? Caden kisses Hazel’s forehead. She coughs and
smiles up at him, then cranes her neck and kisses him on the lips.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: My heart aches so much for you.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: We’re here, Caden. I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I’m aching for it being over.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Yeah. The end is built in to the beginning.
What can you do?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: God. You’re just perfect.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: I’m a mess. But we fit, don’t we. They kiss,
then Hazel climbs into bed.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: It doesn’t always happen for me now. Because
of the medication and everything. I take a lot of pills.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: I don’t care. It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I’m embarrassed. I just want you to know it’s
not you. And it’s not me. It’s the medication. They are tender and quiet
and intensely focused. The smoke in the room is dense. When it’s over,
they lie there quietly, with the occasional cough from both of them.
Caden cries quietly.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: It’s okay. It’s different crying this time. I
can tell. I’m crying, too. And I cried last time. After you left. I
never told you. But I cried, too. Caden kisses her again.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I have a title. The Obscure Moon Lighting an
Obscure World.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: I think it might be too much.</p>
<p><strong>medic</strong>: Might be smoke inhalation. Caden just nods
his head for a long time.</p>
<p><strong>173 continued:173</strong>: She looks at Caden and he is
struck by her resemblance to young Olive. Suddenly the passenger door
opens and Maria gets in the car. He glances over at her, then looks back
out the windshield.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Olive wants to see you. God knows why; the
way you abandoned her.</p>
<p><strong>caden maria</strong>: Oh, shut up.She’s had a fucked-up life
with issues, thanks to you.</p>
<p><strong>caden maria</strong>: You’re insane.She’s dying, asshole. Is
that insane enough for you?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Anyway, she wants to say goodbye to you. God
knows the fuck why.</p>
<p><strong>maria olive</strong>: Hello, darling. Hi.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: This is him.</p>
<p><strong>olive caden</strong>: Hello.Hi, Olive. I’ve missed you so
much.</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: Maria, would you leave us? Maria kisses Olive
again on the forehead.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: In heaven, my darling. Maria exits.</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: Forgive me but no longer remember English.
Speak German?</p>
<p><strong>caden olive</strong>: No. I’m sorry.I had hope you have
learned. Weakly, Olive points to a headset on her night table. She
pantomimes putting it on. Caden puts it on. Olive puts on her own. There
follows a slightly delayed and staticky translation, in an accented male
voice, of everything Olive says, with a delay between what Caden says
and Olive’s response, as she listens in translation.</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: I’m dying, as I’m sure Maria told you. The
flower tattoos have become infected and they’re dying. So I am, as well.
This is life. Olive pulls down her hospital gown a bit to show Caden the
now sickly and decayed flower tattoos.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: It’s Maria. She did this.</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: Maria gave me reason to live once you left.
The flowers defined me.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Your mother and Maria took you away. I tried
for years to find you. I didn’t leave you.</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: You did something. Caden is affected by this.
It resonates.</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: I want to talk to you about your
homosexuality.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: What? I’m not a homosexual!</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: Maria said you would deny it.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: She’s lying to you.</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: I had the same struggle when I first fell in
love with Maria and we began to have dirty, aching sex.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Maria is your lover?</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: Of course. She introduced me to myself. To my
vagina and to hers.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: You have no idea how evil she is.</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: I need to forgive you before I die, but I
can’t forgive someone who has not asked for forgiveness.</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: I have no time! I need you to ask for
forgiveness!</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Can you ever forgive me?</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: For abandoning you.</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: “For abandoning you to have anal sex with my
homosexual lover Eric.”</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: For abandoning you to be have anal sex with
my homosexual lover Eric.</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: No. No, I’m sorry, I cannot. Olive dies. Dead
flower petals slip from her hospital gown. Caden sits there. Maria
hurries rushes to Olive’s side.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: I hope you’re happy, faggot. Caden gets up
and leaves.</p>
<p><strong>hazel’s answering machine</strong>: It’s Hazel. Leave a
message or don’t. Your dime.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: My love. I know how to do the play. It’ll
take place over the course of one day. The day will be the day before
you died, the happiest day of my life. I’ll be able to relive it
forever.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I need a Caden for my Hazel.</p>
<p><strong>millicent</strong>: I… I’d very much like to play Caden.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Um…</p>
<p><strong>177continued:177</strong>: Tammy watches intently. Millicent
smiles at her.</p>
<p><strong>millicent</strong>: I know it would be non-traditional
casting, but I think I’m right for it. I think I understand Caden.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I don’t understand him.</p>
<p><strong>millicent</strong>: Caden Cotard is a man already dead,
living in a half-world between stasis and antistasis. Time is
concentrated and chronology confused for him. Up until recently he has
strived valiantly to make sense of his situation, but now he has turned
to stone.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Okay. That sounds good.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: She’s right? I didn’t see that at all. I
saw it all as more hopeful.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Any thoughts for today’s rehearsal?</p>
<p>****: I have a new title, maybe. Infectious Diseases In Cattle.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Huh.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: The title is about a lot of things. You’ll
see. It’s about a lot.</p>
<p>****: Are you gay, Michael?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Yes. I don’t see what that has to do with
anything.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Do you know someone named Eric?</p>
<p>****: No.</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: Come over tonight? Please?</p>
<p><strong>millicent</strong>: I’d like that.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Ok, take off the sweater. Tammy takes off the
sweater, puts it on the chair back.</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: I’m hot.</p>
<p><strong>millicent</strong>: Yes, you are.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Smile shyly at each other. They do. It
lingers. Millicent looks over at the funeral scene. It’s dull and
static.</p>
<p><strong>millicent</strong>: This is tedious. This is nothing.
Millicent touches Tammy’s hand, heads over to the funeral scene. She
whispers things to some actors, has longer conversations with
others.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: What’s she doing?</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: He’s directing.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: She’s not getting the feel of you, Caden.
You don’t move around. You don’t talk to people. It’s not –</p>
<p><strong>millicent</strong>: Okay, folks, let’s run it! The scene
comes alive with specific activity: weeping Hazel, a little boy in the
back playing with dirt clods, a man and a woman eyeing each other
flirtatiously from a distance, an old woman with Parkinson’s fiddling
with Rosary beads, a well- dressed woman squatting and peeing near a
gravesite. A minister addresses the mourners.</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: Everything is more complicated than you
think. You only see a tenth of what is true. There are a million little
strings attached to every choice you make; you can destroy your life
every time you choose. But maybe you won’t know for twenty years. And
you’ll never ever trace it to its source. And you only get one chance to
play it out. Just try and figure out your own divorce. And they say
there is no fate, but there is: it’s what you create. Even though the
world goes on for eons and eons, you are here for a fraction of a
fraction of a second. Most of your time is spent being dead or not yet
born. But while alive, you wait in vain, wasting years, for a phone call
or a letter or a look from someone or something to make it all right.
And it never comes or it seems to but doesn’t really. And so you spend
your time in vague regret or vaguer hope for something good to come
along. Something to make you feel connected, to make you feel whole, to
make you feel loved.</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: And the truth is I’m so angry and the
truth is I’m so fucking sad, and the truth is I’ve been so fucking hurt
for so fucking long and for just as long have been pretending I’m ok,
just to get along, just for, I don’t know why, maybe because no one
wants to hear about my misery, because they have their own, and their
own is too overwhelming to allow them to listen to or care about mine.
Well, fuck everybody. Amen. Soon it starts to rain. Thunder rumbles.
People pull out umbrellas. Caden looks up, surprised that such a system
is rigged here.</p>
<p><strong>night</strong>: Caden sits with Michael at the director’s
table and stares into space. The actors are doing what they’ve always
done, milling, walking to and fro. Millicent, holding hands with Tammy,
heads up the walk to the Hazel’s house set.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Millicent. She turns. He waves her over.
Tammy sits on the stoop.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: That was … spectacular.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: It really was! Delightful!</p>
<p><strong>millicentcaden</strong>: Thanks.I’m out of ideas. I’m
dead.</p>
<p><strong>millicent</strong>: Oh. I… could take over… as you… for a
bit. Until you feel refreshed.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Yes! Yes! Caden, looks sideways at Michael,
remains silent.</p>
<p><strong>millicent michael</strong>: I think you’re tired, Caden.Yes.
I think you just need All these years of creative some time. To regroup.
work.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I need to keep my hand in.</p>
<p><strong>millicent</strong>: Well, Ellen needs to be filled.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Filled? You mean…?</p>
<p><strong>millicent michael</strong>: Her role. Just for a bit. It’s a
choice role. Just until you’re refreshed.</p>
<p>****: I do like to clean.</p>
<p><strong>adele’s voice</strong>: Ellen, Olive has died. It’s a time of
overwhelming grief so please forgive my mess; I haven’t been able to get
out of bed. Until today. Much affection, A. Caden crosses to the window
and looks up at the night sky, even though it’s clearly the ceiling of
the warehouse. A tiny plane flies by.</p>
<p><strong>old person #2</strong>: Ellen? Is your name Ellen?</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>old person #2</strong>: Caden asked me to give you this.
You’re to keep it in all the time.</p>
<p><strong>182continued:182</strong>: Old Person #2 hands Caden a small
black button. Caden examines it. Old Person #2 points to his own ear, in
which he wears one. Caden sticks it in his ear.</p>
<p><strong>millicent’s voice</strong>: … touched by the sadness of
Adele’s neighbor. So close to death. Reminds me of granny. I should
really call her. Remember how Granny Bascomb bounced me on her knee
pretending to be a horsie. I loved that so much. Say thank you to
Adele’s neighbor.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>old person #2</strong>: You’re very welcome, young lady.</p>
<p><strong>millicent’s voice</strong>: Now say, have a very good
day.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Have a very good day.</p>
<p><strong>old person #2</strong>: I will indeed.</p>
<p><strong>millicent’s voice</strong>: … miss him. Why did he have to
get bored with me? Everyone gets bored with me. I’m not very bright. And
since I put on that weight, I don’t get the looks I used to. It’s not
that bad. Lots of people have it worse. I’ve got a job and place to
stay. Adele is nice to me. And so smart and talented. I don’t understand
her artwork, but that’s just me. I wish I’d gone to college. I feel
stupid around educated people like Adele. Eric was too smart for me,
too. We didn’t talk at all near the end.</p>
<p><strong>millicent’s voice</strong>: I’d try to tell him about my day
and he’d get this far away look in his eyes. I kind of felt sorry for
him; he seemed so miserable with me. I guess – Caden drifts off to
sleep.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I’m making eggs.</p>
<p>****: Is everything okay, Eric?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Everything’s everything.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Ellen, why do you look so serious?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I’m going to remember this moment for the
rest of my life, mama. And in exactly twenty years, come here with my
daughter and have exactly the same picnic.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Baby, that’s the loveliest thing I’ve ever
heard.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: There was supposed to be something else. I
was to have something. A calm. A love. Children. A child, at least.
Children. Meaning. I am always on the verge, never more than a tiny
shove from tears. I can feel them in my chest now. That squeezing
pressure. And it is so tempting to let go, but I am afraid, the next
time maybe, I will never stop crying. I miss my husband even though he
is lying here. He hates me. Oh God. I have disappointed him and he hates
me. The one person who should be able to see me and he won’t look. He
will never look again.</p>
<p><strong>morning</strong>: Caden lies on his back, and opens his eyes.
His pumps drone.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Eric. Caden looks over. No note from Adele.
He gets out of bed, glances in the mirror, seems surprised by his
reflection.</p>
<p><strong>millicent’s voice</strong>: My period is late this month. I
wonder what’s going on. I’m bloated. I wish it would come.</p>
<p><strong>millicent’s voice</strong>: I can’t believe she said that to
him! She’s a slut, anyway. He sticks a bookmark in the book, puts it on
the night table, turns off the light, and lies on his back with his eyes
open.</p>
<p><strong>millicent’s voice</strong>: Maybe I can ask Adele for a
raise. It’s been three years. I do a good job. God, I’m so tired
tonight. I’m getting old. I’m lonely here.</p>
<p><strong>morning</strong>: Caden awakens. He switches off his
pumps.</p>
<p><strong>millicent’s voice</strong>: Get up. Look at the night table
for a note from Adele. Caden gets up and glances at the night table. A
type-written</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: Adele died of lung cancer last night.
You may stay on if you like.</p>
<p><strong>millicent’s voice</strong>: Look shocked. Weep. Caden looks
shocked, then weeps.</p>
<p><strong>millicent’s voice</strong>: Go into the kitchen and – The
voice stops. Caden stops. He waits. Nothing. He takes out the earpiece
and looks at it, shakes it, then slips it back in his ear. Nothing. He
waits. In the distance he hears wailing and gun shots.</p>
<p><strong>old person #2</strong>: There’s nobody running it anymore.
Caden looks at Old Person #2 and nods.</p>
<p><strong>2055 - morning</strong>: Deserted here too. The same
occasional fires, flooding, dead bodies.</p>
<p><strong>- 2055 - morning</strong>: Caden walks, soon arriving at the
warehouse set within the warehouse set. He enters.</p>
<p><strong>- 2055 - morning</strong>: Another dark, deserted street,
more bodies, fires, floods. Caden panics. He pulls out his earpiece,
shakes it, and puts it back. He walks.</p>
<p><strong>- 2055</strong>: He arrives at the warehouse within the
warehouse within the warehouse. He enters.</p>
<p><strong>- 2055 - day</strong>: Deserted. Caden walks. He gets in a
golf cart and drives through the deserted street sets.</p>
<p><strong>- 2055 - continuous</strong>: Caden reaches the beach set,
and drives the cart on the sand. He sees footprints. He gets out and
follows them, spots a woman ahead walking with a suitcase. He hurries as
much as he can with his limp, his weakness, his ancient body, to catch
up with her.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Hello. The woman turns. She’s middle-aged,
face radiating kindness.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Where is everybody?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Mostly dead. Some have left.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Would you sit with me for a moment? I’m very
tired. And lonely. The woman smiles at Caden. They sit on a log.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I feel like I know you.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: I was the mother in Ellen’s dream. Perhaps
from there.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Yes! That’s it. Yes. You seem a bit older
than I remember.</p>
<p>****: That dream was quite a while ago. He’s silent. The woman
touches his hand.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I didn’t mean to say you look old.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: Everyone’s dreams in all those apartments.
All those secrets we’ll never know. That’s the truth of it – all the
thoughts nobody will ever know.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: It’s true.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I’m sorry the experiment didn’t work. I
wanted it to with all my heart. I wanted to do that picnic with my
daughter. I feel I’ve disappointed you terribly.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: No. No. I am so proud of you. Caden starts to
tear up.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: All I want is someone to see me, someone to
look at me with kindness. For me to be the most special person in the
world to just one person.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: I know, baby. I know. He looks at her
tentatively. She’s looking into his eyes directly, clearly, kindly. She
smiles.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: You’re going to be fine. Caden starts to weep
so hard he chokes. Strings of snot pour from his nose. The woman holds
him, gently takes off his wig, and strokes his sparse hair. He looks out
over her shoulder at the dark empty city at the far end of the
warehouse. His rheumy eyes light up.</p>
<p><strong>caden</strong>: I know what to do with this play now. I have
an idea. I think – The screen goes black fast.</p>
