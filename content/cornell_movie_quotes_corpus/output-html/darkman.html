<h1 id="darkman">darkman</h1>
<p><strong>bang!!</strong>: A shock chord as we cut from black to a
harshly toplit</p>
<p><strong>close shot:</strong>: A man is talking into a cellular phone.
He is a paunchy but powerful looking black man, bald with a gray fringe.
His baldness makes his head look muscular; he is a tough man whose life
has been shaped by the violence of the docks. His name is EDDIE BLACK.
In the distance a foghorn moans. We are pulling back.</p>
<p><strong>black</strong>: Yeah. .’Cause he’s an asshole. Tell him no…
Tell him no too… Him, tell fuck you… Yeah… Uh huh… The continuing pull
back shows that we are inside a huge empty pier building. Black is
leaning against the roof of his car, which is parked in the middle of
the vast empty space. The room is lit by bare bulbs, its farthest
reaches falling into darkness.</p>
<p><strong>black</strong>: No, I’ll be a few minutes here. Guy comin’
up, thinks he’s gonna muscle me outs my property… Does it matter? Just
another tough guy…Yeah, okay… Another hard-looking man is
approaching.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: They’re drivin’ up. Black nods.</p>
<p><strong>black</strong>: Get their pieces. We got a surprise for those
fuckers.</p>
<p><strong>2 ext wharf - day</strong>: We are tracking towards a chain
link fence which is swinging open to admit two midnight blue Lincoln
Continentals. The cars stop in the foreground and eight men get out,
eerily backlit in the mist of the riverfront.</p>
<p><strong>3 slow tracking - robert g. durant</strong>: is a
well-dressed and immaculately groomed man of forty.</p>
<p><strong>4 slow tracking - rudy guzman</strong>: wears a powder blue,
polyester leisure suit. His nose has been broken several times from his
years in the Mexican boxing league. He was almost a contender.</p>
<p><strong>5 slow tracking - skip natick</strong>: walks with a
pronounced limp.</p>
<p><strong>6 slow tracking - trumayne johnson mc sam</strong>: is a
large black man with a quiet, studied cool.</p>
<p><strong>7 slow tracking - rick</strong>: is a wiry twenty-year old
who looks about in short, jerky motions. He huddles in behind the
others. He is stylishly dressed, with slicked back, black hair. His
protruding Adams apple bobs as he swallows.</p>
<p><strong>b slow tracking - smiley 8</strong>: wears a permanent
psychotic smile.</p>
<p><strong>9 slow tracking - pauly 9</strong>: is middle-aged and
balding. His spare tire hangs over the edge of his suit pants. He
subdues a belch. He raises a bottle of Maalox and slugs down fifty cents
worth. A ring of white chalky fluid coats his lips.</p>
<p><strong>10 slow tracking - corky corcoran 10</strong>: has a thatch
of blond hair, he spits out tobacco juice between his wide spaced front
teeth. 11 They are approached by a group of fifteen dock workers, 11
Black’s men, with massive shoulders and grain-sack bellies. Looks like
they just got off their shift and now they’re ready to kick some
ass.</p>
<p><strong>dock worker</strong>: Okay, against the car, ladies. You’re c
gonna stand for a search. 12 The eight visitors assume the position,
placing their 12 hands on the roof of their car. The dock workers pat
them down and haul off iron – lots of it.</p>
<p><strong>dock worker #2</strong>: Bunch a cuties.</p>
<p><strong>dock worker #3</strong>: Put skirts on ’em, I’d marry one.
From the other Dock Workers, hearty male laughter. The visitors bare up
in silence.</p>
<p><strong>13 int pier building – night 13</strong>: As the visitors are
led in, into the beams of the car headlights, escorted by the dock
workers. The Dock Workers take up positions around Durant and his
men.</p>
<p><strong>14 black</strong>: stands waiting for them. He eyes Skip, the
limper.</p>
<p><strong>black</strong>: Bum leg?</p>
<p><strong>skip</strong>: No leg.</p>
<p>****: I was engaged to a girl with a wooden leg once. Skip
brightens.</p>
<p>****: Yeah? What happened?</p>
<p><strong>black</strong>: I hadda break it off.</p>
<p><strong>black</strong>: okay, let’s cut the crap here. Durant, I got
just three things to say to you. One He holds up a chubby finger.</p>
<p><strong>black</strong>: I ain’t selling my property. He flashes a
second finger.</p>
<p><strong>black</strong>: Two. Nobody muscles Eddie Black Especially a
bunch of fucks. He flashes a third finger.</p>
<p><strong>ppy</strong>: Number three, if you guys is unha with that,
which I can already is, then we can cutcha balls of f if that’ll be more
satisfactory.</p>
<p><strong>19 continued</strong>: The last shot echoes away to leave
silence – except for the arhythmic echoing scuffle of Skip’s one shoe,
as he continues to hop in place for balance. Smiley, after a watchful
pause to make sure everyone is dead, sticks out his left arm at waist
level. Skip grabs the arm for support, stops hopping, and there is
now…total silence.</p>
<p><strong>robert g. durant</strong>: the elegantly suited leader, takes
out a cigar and a gold-plated cigar trimmer. SNIP–he trims the and of
the cigar, and sticks it in his mouth. As he walks towards the dumbly
apprehensive Black:</p>
<p><strong>durant</strong>: Now let’s consider my points, one by
one…</p>
<p><strong>guzman</strong>: puts a full nelson on Black. Trumayne, grabs
Black’s right hand and holds it out, fingers splayed, towards
Durant.</p>
<p><strong>durant</strong>: One… He slips one of Black’s fingers into
his cigar trimmer.</p>
<p><strong>durant</strong>: .1 try not to let my anger get the better of
me. SNIP! Black screams. As Durant goes for another finger:</p>
<p><strong>durant</strong>: …Two: I don’t always succeed. SNIP! Black
screams. Reaching for another finger:</p>
<p><strong>durant</strong>: …Three: I’ve got seven more points.</p>
<p><strong>2 0 ext wharf - day - long shot</strong>: Looking down on the
lonely waterfront building, we hear Black’s screams.</p>
<p><strong>21 int westlake lab - day - an enormous eye</strong>: Making
jerky little movements this way and that.</p>
<p><strong>eye’s pov: an enormous nose</strong>: We pull focus through
the nose, then back to sharp focus again. The nose fills the screen,
every pore a cavern, every blemish a mountain.</p>
<p><strong>eye</strong>: Blinking.</p>
<p><strong>nose</strong>: The nostrils flare slightly.</p>
<p><strong>eye</strong>: Looking.</p>
<p><strong>nose</strong>: Still. Suddenly it is hit by a flash of light
as – B- DEEEE – we hear the automatic wind of a camera and its strobe
recharging. B-DEEEEE! B-DEEEE! We get rapid-fire left and right nose
profiles.</p>
<p><strong>22 wider</strong>: We are in a lab. DR. PEYTON WESTLAKE, an
earnest scientist in his early thirties, is straightening up from behind
a futuristic looking, tripod-mounted camera. He front the camera and
instantly hits a button nt of ut. thenfro eof o</p>
<p><strong>22 continued 22</strong>: The nose belongs to YAKITITO
YANAGITA a Japanese graduate’ student wearing a lab smock and glasses
with thick, coke bottle lenses.</p>
<p><strong>peyton</strong>: Now, if everything goes according to plan,
in a couple of months your nose will be on the lips of every American…
He is feeding the prints into the input slot of a computer.</p>
<p><strong>22p on the computer screen: 22p</strong>: The nose is broken
down into thousands of points. As each point of the nose is removed from
the screen, a number is assigned.</p>
<p><strong>peyton</strong>: We’ve finally got the Imager working how we
want it. 24 We pan to the Holographic Imaging Cylinder. The glass 24
cylinder, wired to the computer, glows to life. 24P A three dimensional
holographic image of Yakatito’s nose 24P rotates within. 25 Peyton
glances from the Imager to the computer. He types 25 on the computer
keyboard.</p>
<p><strong>peyton</strong>: Bio-press checks out okay… He glances
to…</p>
<p><strong>26 the bio-press 26</strong>: As it hums to life. It is a box
containing linear rows of densely packed pins. Tiny servo-motors beneath
the pins allow each pin to rise or fall individually, per computer
command. A smooth synthetic substance is being sprayed evenly atop the
surface of the pins. The sprays halts; the wet substance glistens. The
densely packed pins rise to programmed heights, molding the solidifying
synthetic substance into an exact replica of Yakatito’s nose.</p>
<p><strong>peyton</strong>: I don’t know about perfect, but it looks
like your nose. Down to the millimole… No, the bio-press won’t be a
problem. It’s the synthetic</p>
<p><strong>would</strong>: skin’s instability. If the</p>
<p><strong>a skinu</strong>: just hold up – Y give me victim and a
photograph of his old face – he’ll get more than a nose. We’re talking
complete reconstruction</p>
<p><strong>maybe even</strong>: damaged skin tissue. make him better
looking. Hey, what’s the time?</p>
<p><strong>yakitito</strong>: fumbles for the stopwatch that hangs
around his neck.</p>
<p><strong>yakitito</strong>: Ninety-eight minute and change.</p>
<p><strong>peyton</strong>: Let’s check in our friends.</p>
<p><strong>peyton</strong>: moves to a microscope.</p>
<p><strong>27p microscope p.o.v.</strong>: Cells swimming in an
agar-protoplasm bath.</p>
<p><strong>29 a computer monitor</strong>: that is connected to the
microscope.</p>
<p><strong>v28” the computer screen reads: v28</strong>: Amino acid
content - 64.0% Membrane potential - 120 millivolts DNA content -
00.000047 millimoles Collagen congeners - 22.8% 29 Peyton punches in
some data, and… 29</p>
<p><strong>v29. the image on the computer screen splits. v29</strong>:
on the left half, a rotating, three dimensional, computer generated
image of a protein molecule. Beneath it, the</p>
<p><strong>epidermis</strong>: On the right half of the screen, another
image forms. It is a second molecule. Beneath it, the words:</p>
<p><strong>structural match</strong>: The molecules rotate in
synchronization. A loud beeping tone. Suddenly, the synthetic molecule
begins to waver and spin randomly.</p>
<p><strong>30 peyton</strong>: Oh no…</p>
<p><strong>31 view through microscope 31</strong>: The unstable cells
fragment.</p>
<p><strong>32 int westlake lab 32</strong>: Peyton shoves himself away
from the microscope.</p>
<p><strong>peyton</strong>: Fragmentation. Time? Yakitito checks his
stopwatch.</p>
<p><strong>yakitito</strong>: Ninety-nine minute. Again.</p>
<p><strong>32 continued</strong>: He stares dumbly at the stopwatch,
frozen. He repeats,</p>
<p><strong>yakitito</strong>: ..Ninety-nine minute. Cells always break
up at a ninety-nine minute. He punches away at a keyboard and takes the
readout.</p>
<p><strong>peyton</strong>: Electrolytes, temp and glucose
concentration. all normal.</p>
<p><strong>yakitito</strong>: But still this ninety nine minute.
Yakitito makes a notation of the time on a lab sheet.</p>
<p><strong>peyton</strong>: Pacing, thinking;</p>
<p><strong>peyton</strong>: Why? What is destabilizing it? Vivification
process was cake. Tissue rejection? We licked that. We’re close. We’re
smart guys. So why can’t we make these cells stable? Hokay. Let’s try a
ten percent alkalinity. Get those suckers too drunk to fragment.</p>
<p><strong>yakitito</strong>: posts the completed lab sheet on a wall
covered with hundreds of similar sheets.</p>
<p><strong>yakitito</strong>: We already try ten. He pokes at a section
of lab sheets.</p>
<p><strong>yakitito</strong>: And twenty. And twenty-two… We try all
phase of alkalinity. He punches the wall. CONTINUED</p>
<p><strong>yakitito</strong>: But still a ninety-nine minute! Three
month ago, ninety nine minute. Ten month ago… ninety nine minute… BAM
BAM… Yakitito punches the wall again and again. Peyton calmly taps a
plastic dunking bird that slowly bobs.</p>
<p><strong>peyton</strong>: A word of advice, Yakitito. Don’t get
emotionally involved. Watch. Analyze. Remain object —</p>
<p><strong>bam!</strong>: He is cut off as Yakitito punches the wall
again and again to punctuate his speech.</p>
<p><strong>yakitito</strong>: Maybe I am lousy scientist.</p>
<p><strong>maybeoi</strong>: listen to father, get in Anaheim! Get drunk
on Sake nightly, forget I am failure!</p>
<p><strong>peyton</strong>: Quick, Yakitito. A basketball appears in
Peyton’s hands. He tosses it to</p>
<p><strong>yakitito</strong>: Catches the ball.</p>
<p><strong>peyton</strong>: The most striking characteristic of
thermionic emission.</p>
<p><strong>yakitito</strong>: Throws the ball away.</p>
<p><strong>ke</strong>: No, always you ask me question to ma me calm
down! I no want to calm down!</p>
<p><strong>peyton</strong>: catches the ball, dribbles and throws it
back to Yakitito.</p>
<p><strong>peyton</strong>: The answer, Yakitito.</p>
<p><strong>yaxitito</strong>: snags the ball angrily from the air.</p>
<p>****: It is most strongly depending on temperature! He throws it at
Peyton, who grabs it, and pump-fakes Yakitito, not letting him have the
ball.</p>
<p><strong>peyton</strong>: Go on! Again he pump-fakes. Yakitito
flinches.</p>
<p><strong>yakitito</strong>: This means the temperature of the emitter
is not critical as long as it is sufficiently high and as long as pure
metals with high operating temperatures such as tungsten or tantalum are
used. Peyton tosses him the ball. Yakitito catches it. Calm now. He
blinks.</p>
<p><strong>yakitito</strong>: Amazing. It work every time.</p>
<p><strong>33 continued</strong>: JULIE HASTINGS, a young attractive
woman who has apparently been awaiting their arrival rises from a chair
and crosses the lobby to greet them. She is dressed in a conservative
business suit and carries a briefcase.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Mr. Strack, my name is Julie Hastings. I’m
here from Pappas and Swain to represent you in the Von Hoffenstein
negotiation.</p>
<p><strong>strack jr.</strong>: How do you do? And please, call me
Louis. This is my father who– Strack Sr. interrupts his son’s
introduction.</p>
<p><strong>strack sr.</strong>: I don’t want some fancy-ass woman to do
my negotiating. Where’s Herb Gorson?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Gorson’s tied up in litigation this week.
Don’t worry–I’ve done my homework.</p>
<p><strong>strack sr.</strong>: scowls, ungraciously accepting her.</p>
<p>****: I’ll stop worrying when you get Von Balibreaker’s price down to
sixty million… He turns and starts striding down the hallway, the others
following.</p>
<p><strong>strack sr.</strong>: .If he goes that low, lock him up.</p>
<p><strong>34 int hunt club private dining. room - day</strong>: The
Stracks and Julie are seated at a table next to a large picture window
that looks out on the bridle path. Jodhpured equestrians gallop past in
the distance. Seated across from them are Baron Hugo Von Hoffenstein, a
bald, hook-nosed Austrian aristocrat with a patrician air and cold beady
eyes. He is accompanied by his attorney Myron Katz. Liveried waiters are
just clearing the table and serving coffee.</p>
<p><strong>katz</strong>: We want to be reasonable here. We said we were
interested in selling the pier frontage and we are interested in
selling. But frankly Mr. Von .will not be robbed. Seventy-five strikes
us as a fair price for this parcel. We’re ready to conclude a deal here
and now at that price.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Then I guess we’re only missing one element
here.</p>
<p><strong>katz</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: An interested party. Strack Jr. tries to
suppress a smile. Waiters bring in the wine and pour a tasting portion
for Von Hoffenstein, silent, coldly watchful. He rolls the wine in his
glass, eyes appraising Julie. He takes a sip, cocks his head, nods. Wine
is poured around.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: .Mr. Katz, I’ve found that in the real estate
business, three factors determine a property’s worth. CONTINUED</p>
<p><strong>34 continued</strong>: Katz leans forward, listening.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: …Location. Location. And… location. Frankly,
you have none of the above. Your fair price is fair for midtown
commercial, not for riverfront.</p>
<p><strong>katz</strong>: It’s worth more to your client, given his
plans for the area.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: if my client can spin straw into gold, he’ll
still pay market price for straw. As a matter of fact–</p>
<p><strong>von hoffensteen</strong>: –Business is business. Deals vill
come and go, but ze velt vill pause for a beautiful voman…and a fine
wine.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Our offer stands at forty-eight.</p>
<p><strong>von hoffenstien</strong>: Smiles a worldly smile.</p>
<p><strong>von hoffinstien</strong>: Let us toast a zale at ze price of
zixty millions. Strack Sr. smiles. He starts to raise his glass,
preparing to toast.</p>
<p><strong>camera dips incredibly fast</strong>: beneath the table to
reveal Julie’s high heel as it digs into Strack Sr’s toe to silence
him.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: To Von Hoffenstein: CONTINUED</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: You’re moving in the right direction, but our
offer stands firm. i believe if anyone had</p>
<p><strong>be</strong>: offered you more than us, you’d sharing this
wine with them. She sips the wine and then, frowning, turns to the wine
steward.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: .There’s been a mistake. We ordered a bottle
of ’67 Beaujolais Maison Reme. Is that not correct?</p>
<p><strong>steward</strong>: Oui madame. ’67 Beaujolais Maison Reme. Is
what I have serve. Julie pleasantly but firmly corrects him.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: No. You have served us a 1981 or 1982.
California Beaujolais.</p>
<p><strong>you’re</strong>: Pleasant, but hardly worth charging… Strack
Sr., frowning, examines the wine. It’s news to him.</p>
<p><strong>steward</strong>: Please, Madame! I serve the Reme!</p>
<p><strong>strack sr.</strong>: Mine tastes okay.</p>
<p><strong>katz</strong>: Ms. Hastings, please. The wine is fine. You’re
way out of your league here. I’m sure the wine steward–</p>
<p><strong>from</strong>: plucks the CALIFORNIA</p>
<p><strong>34 continued</strong>: The wine steward whispers sharply in
French to the waiter, then turns back to the table.</p>
<p><strong>steward</strong>: Please forgive us. We bring the bel Reme.at
once. Gratis. Julie addresses the baron.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: At any rate, our offer stands at forty-eight…
As she rises:</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: .And if we can’t toast, we prefer not to
drink. These gentlemen and I have other business to attend to, so if
you’ll excuse us… Strack Sr. rises, angrily. He turns to leave with her,
murmuring under his breath:</p>
<p><strong>strack sr.</strong>: I told you to make this deal. Von
Hoffenstein calls after them his wine glass held</p>
<p><strong>von hoffenstein</strong>: Permit me, madame! Too fine a vine
not to use for a toast!</p>
<p><strong>strack jr.</strong>: How much did she pay you?</p>
<p>****: Monsieur, I don’t know what you are talking about!</p>
<p><strong>strack jr.</strong>: For that little trick with the labels.
He takes the stewards fist in his and unfurls the steward’s fingers.
Revealing–A HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL. Strack Jr. turns to Julie’s retreating
figure and smiles.</p>
<p><strong>36 int westlake lab - day - a glass beaker</strong>: filled
with clear fluid. Above it is another beaker filled with a brown
crystalline substance. Above that is an empty beaker.</p>
<p><strong>whooosh!</strong>: The fluid disappears from the bottom
beaker and instantly reconstitutes in the top beaker as a steaming brown
fluid.</p>
<p><strong>peyton</strong>: .Time, Yakitito.</p>
<p><strong>yakitito</strong>: Ninety eight minute. A light goes out,
leaving the lab in darkness except for the glow from the computer
screen.</p>
<p><strong>yakitito</strong>: .Is a bulb. I get a fresh.</p>
<p><strong>37 continued</strong>: As he rummages in a drawer:</p>
<p><strong>yakitito</strong>: So, did you ask her?</p>
<p><strong>peyton</strong>: Tonight. Out of habit, Peyton glances back
to the microscope.</p>
<p><strong>yakitito</strong>: This is unbelievable! You been saying
tonight for weeks and still you don’t ask her! Maybe I ask to marry
you.</p>
<p><strong>peyton</strong>: Your father would never approve of me.
Yakitito stares at him in puzzlement. Then:</p>
<p><strong>yakitito</strong>: 216, no, I ask he if gbg marry you. I
Peyton looks through the microscope;</p>
<p><strong>38 microscope pov</strong>: The cells still pulsate with

<p><strong>strack jr.</strong>: Gold Kugerands are looking attractive.
Another long pause.</p>
<p><strong>strack sr.</strong>: Are those the ones with the chocolate
centers? Another pause.</p>
<p>****: Gold currency, father, as you know. And yet another pause.</p>
<p><strong>strack sr.</strong>: Krugerrands. Sounds like a frog trying
to burp. Strack Industries will stick with real estate. You remember
that.</p>
<p><strong>43 the limo 43</strong>: suddenly glides into a rundown
Texaco station.</p>
<p><strong>strack sr.</strong>: What the hell!</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: We have a flat, sir. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>strack sr.</strong>: You should be. This’ll come out of your
wages.</p>
<p><strong>the tire</strong>: is’NOT flat.</p>
<p><strong>the driver</strong>: discretely removes a straight-razor from
his coat pocket and approaches the tire.</p>
<p><strong>strack sr.</strong>: Time I took a leak anyway. Damn

twenty times a day. Strack Sr. exits the car.</p>

hurriedly, head bowed to the wind. CAMERA MOVES</p>
<p><strong>strack sr.</strong>: who hobbles directly toward the man.
CAMERA SWISHES in front of Strack Sr. to again reveal.</p>
<p><strong>the man</strong>: Closer now. A one-quarter-view of the man’s
downturned face. he looks up–revealing DURANT! A terrible malevolent
grin as he lifts his newspaper. We make out the muzzle of a silencer.
CAMERA SWISHES TO.</p>
<p><strong>close shot of strack sr.</strong>: A muffled POP as he jerks
backward, clutching his chest.</p>
<p><strong>high angle</strong>: The two men pass.</p>
<p><strong>49 ext limousine - his pov 49</strong>: Strack Sr. crumbling
to the ground atop a black cable. A bell sounds continuously within the
service station.</p>
<p><strong>strack jr.</strong>: Father?</p>
<p><strong>strack jr.</strong>: races out of the car and rushes over to
his father.</p>
<p><strong>strack jr.</strong>: Father!</p>
<p><strong>strack sr.</strong>: lies motionless on his stomach. Strack
Jr. turns him over, revealing that Strack Sr.’s chest is flooded in
BLOOD.</p>
<p><strong>a screeching sound</strong>: as a midnight blue Lincoln
Continental races away from the scene.</p>
<p><strong>strack jr.</strong>: lifts his father. Emotion etched on
every line of his face, he cradles the old corpse in his arms, lifting
him off the black cable, and the ringing sound is finally silenced.</p>
<p><strong>darkness</strong>: Julie ascending a flight of shadowy
stairs. The steps creak as she climbs them. We hear the eerie drip,
drip, dripping of a water pipe.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: is uneasy. She halts halfway up the stairs to
listen. We hear only the scurry of cautiously.</p>
<p><strong>the lab door</strong>: Julie reaches the landing and knocks…
causing the door to open with a CREAK…</p>
<p><strong>52 int westlake lab - night</strong>: …Julie moves
tentatively through the lab, increasingly frightened, sensing the
presence of another person.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Peyton?</p>
<p><strong>52 continued 52</strong>: No answer. As she starts to back
towards the door she brushes against a table. Something rolls and
SHATTERS on the floor …a test-tube.</p>
<p><strong>a beam of light</strong>: extends from one wall to the other.
Reacting to the shattered test-tube, Julie steps backward into the
beam.</p>
<p><strong>click</strong>: a photic-sensor picks up the disturbance.</p>
<p><strong>crash! crash! crash!</strong>: Corrugated steel coverings
slide down the windows, blocking out all light from the laboratory…
There’s a WHIRRING</p>
<p><strong>speakers</strong>: extrude slowly from slots over the
windows.</p>
<p><strong>a voice</strong>: fills the room. It is a hollow Voice that
echos about the lab.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Please be seated. A spotlight SNAPS on,
illuminating a chair behind her. Numbly, she sits in it.</p>
<p><strong>a screen</strong>: tak l in of her. Tvoice tak cati nal

<p><strong>voice</strong>: ve. ow does it work? A Westlake Yanigita
presentation. A smile spreads across Julie’s face.</p>
<p><strong>52 continued</strong>: A slide is projected on the screen. It
shows a sunset over the ocean. Very corny, distorted music over this
shot.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Love. Science is perplexed over this great
mystery. Shot of Peyton and Yakitito in white lab coats, identical looks
of perplexity on their, faces. Julie laughs.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: What are the causes of love? How do we detect
its presence? What are its effects? These are some of the questions we
will investigate in this lesson. Again the sunset and distorted
music.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Part one. je origins 21 ve. The sunset is
replaced by split-screen photos of Peyton and Julie, age twelve. Peyton
peers into a test-tube through glasses too big for his face. Julie
assumes a mock-debonair pose for the camera.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: These lovers first met on a seventh grade
field trip to the planetarium… Shot of the night sky, rich with stars
and galaxies.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: While the narrator discussed the origins of
the universe, Peyton held Julie’s hand. Shot of a somewhat nerdy Peyton
with his arm stiffly around Julie.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: You were so slick.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Our test-subjects were soon–to use the jargon
of teenagers–“going out.” This “going out” period can be as short as a
single date, or as long as a lifetime. Montage of Peyton and Julie
throughout the years.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: In the case of these two–a rare phenomenon–it
lasted twenty years.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Although we broke up sixteen times. Sunset
and distorted music.</p>
<p><strong>tua</strong>: Part two. Mating rumpled bed, The sunset is
replaced by a shot of Julie on a working on legal briefs, a camera-faced
shadow crossing the image.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Certain objects develop a special, shared
meaning to lovers. Here are some objects significant to our test
subjects. Shot of coffee-rings on a table.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: The coffee rings Peyton tends to leave. They
irritate Julie, and he leaves them everywhere! Quick shots. Coffee rings
on a lab report. Coffee rings on a book-shelf. Coffee rings on a wall
and ceiling. Julie laughs.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Yet such minor irritations can strangely
become endearing to the other mate.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Not just yet they haven’t. The slide changes
to a shot of a bottle covered in wax.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: The bottle of Dom Perignon Champagne Julie
gave Peyton for his twenty-first birthday. Now it serves as a candle
holder.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I never gave you that. The champagne bottle
is replaced by a shot of a record album turning on a player. The music
plays over the image. Haunting. Romantic.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Finally, the single Love in the ark The song
continues. Julie smiles, swept away by it.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: This song was playing when the two first
kissed. A high school prom picture comes up on the screen. Peyton in an
awkwardly fitting tux and Julie, a blossoming beauty. In the slide, they
have been caught kissing.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Now let us leave our test-subjects. The
sunset again. ov in the Dark theme plays over it,. and eventually fades
away.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Love. It’s fundamental nature still eludes
modern Science. Yet researchers across the globe continue to study this
ancient and powerful phenomenon. Hoping one day, to unlock love’s
mystery. Credits come on. A Westlake/Yanagita Presentation. Etc. Peyton
The lights in the lab come on. Julie turns around. steps out from behind
the slide projector.</p>
<p><strong>peyton</strong>: Pretty stupid, huh?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I thought it was beautiful-</p>
<p><strong>peyton</strong>: Yakitito helped. I just wanted you to see
it. It was just something I wanted you to. . know.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I know. Peyton wraps his arms about her.
Julie moves close and they kiss.</p>
<p><strong>fold-out</strong>: HALTS on Peyton an�EuRl et� y

<p><strong>54 later that night</strong>: Peyton watches Julie as she
sleeps, his shadow crossing her beautiful face. He strokes her hair.</p>
<p><strong>55 int westlake lab - morning 55</strong>: Sunshine streams
through the sheers of the window onto Julie’s shoulder. She sits on the
bed going over some papers, her expression increasingly disturbed. Julie
punches a number into the phone.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: .Dale Gorson, please… Peyton’s hand enters
with a mug of coffee, which he sets on the papers in front of her.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Peyton! Julie takes the mug away; it has
indeed left a brown circle on the topmost memo. Julie smiles at him.
Then:</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Dale? Yes, Julie Hastings… yes, I found some
memos researching the Von Hoffenstein deal that I don’t think I was
supposed to find… From the late Mr. Strack to a guy named Claude
Bellasarious. They’re records of payments to various people on the
zoning commission… Peyton, behind her, massages her back.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: .They look like payoffs. Suspicious, at the
very least… Well, the way I’d like to proceed is to talk to Strack’s son
first… Give him the benefit of the doubt. Under the circumstances, it’s
the least I can do. She hangs up. Peyton kisses her. She leans back into
his arms and closes her eyes blissfully. Reluctantly, she rises and
slips on her shoes. Peyton watches her admiring everything about her.
She gracefully lays her legal papers in her briefcase and heads for the
door. Half way out the door she turns to Peyton.</p>
<p><strong>55 continued</strong>: Bye. I’ll call l you tonight. Maybe we
can get together. She exits.</p>
<p><strong>peyton</strong>: The sound of the closing door echos. He sits
alone on the ksd, looking about the empty apartment and lab beyond.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: In an impressive corporate power suit,
briefcase in hand, walks briskl y down the sunny sidewalk, stopping at
the intersection to sig nal a cab Suddenly, running up behind her..</p>
<p><strong>57 peyton 57</strong>: Dressed in jeans and sweatshirt,
hurries to catch up to her.</p>
<p><strong>peyton</strong>: Julie, wait! She is opening the cab door
when she turns to him.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>peyton</strong>: I’ve been thinking. Maybe we should get
married.</p>
<p><strong>58 julie 58</strong>: Freezes half in and half out of the cab
door. Panicked.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Marriage–well, we could do that–of course,
there’s our careers–I men, I’m just starting to get things going at the
firm. And, you know, I kind of like having my own</p>
<p><strong>peyton</strong>: ’We’re practically living together now. All
marriage means is you answer the phone in the and if you to pretend
grandmother, it’s a wrong number. The poor woman’s beginning to think
she has alzheimer’s.</p>
<p>****: i–i can’t talk about this now…</p>
<p><strong>peyton</strong>: Julie, I’m asking you to marry me.</p>
<p><strong>60 the cabbie</strong>: leans out of the cab to Julie.</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: He got a ring?</p>
<p><strong>end a</strong>: Peyton, you didn’t go ou anp d you? lot of
money on a ring, di</p>
<p><strong>peyton</strong>: Ring? Oh, no, I don’t have a ring.</p>
<p><strong>61 the cabbie</strong>: motions for Julie. She leans
close.</p>
<p>****: He don’t show much sense of commitment.</p>
<p><strong>62 peyton 62</strong>: Bends down into frame and gives the
Cabbie a look that would stop a wristwatch.</p>
<p><strong>63 the cabbie 63</strong>: responds by starting the meter
running.</p>
<p><strong>peyton</strong>: I mean, I just now finally</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I love you, Peyton… She climbs into the cab,
closes the door.</p>
<p><strong>peyton</strong>: -Realized how much–</p>
<p>****: but I guess I’m not ready. 64 Julie leans close to kiss him,
but the cab pulls into 64 traffic.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Watches Peyton grow smaller as the cab moves
off. Julie looks longingly back at Peyton. Did she make the right
choice? She back once more for Peyton but he is only a tiny dot in the
distance.</p>
<p><strong>67 i/e the city from strack’s office - day</strong>: From
many, many stories up. We are pulling back.</p>
<p><strong>strack’s voice</strong>: Yes, go ahead, put a buy on the
Kugerands… Thank you for your sympathy, Franz. He was a great man. And
as long as Strack Industries flourishes my father lives on. The pull
back shows Strack behind his power desk, talking nd Strack into the
phone. waves the person on into his lush corporatecoffice</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: .Very good. Thank you. He hangs up.</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: .Miss Hastings. Have a seat.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Thank you for seeing me, Mr. Strack… I’m
–sorry about your father. I heard last night.</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: My father was a great man, and his</p>
<p><strong>can get</strong>: loss is felt by you something?
allfof?us.</p>
<p>****: Maison Reme 1967?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: No thank you. Mr. Strack, I’ve been going
over some documents and I came across something that puzzled me. It’s a
memo from your office to a Mr. Claude Bellasarious–it went out over your
father’s signature. It detailed</p>
<p><strong>certain payments–</strong>: Strack has gotten up to pace.</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: Yes yes, I know the memo. Julie continues,
hesitantly:</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: …It seems like the payments… were-</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: They were pay-offs. To the zoning
commission. Bribes, to call a spade a spade. He gives her an appraising
look.</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: .Does that shock you?</p>
<p>****: No. In fact I’d surmised as much.</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: But it disappoints you.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Well it’s hardly my place to–</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: That’s right, it’s not your place. Yet I
value your good opinion.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Surely you don’t expect me to endorse it.</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: Course not. I’m sure my father never
intended for you to know about it. I’m sorry if He’s compromised you in
any way. But I am asking you to understand. I’m not going to bore you
with that old speech about how we all have to swim in the same pond. But
you know as well as I that</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: not so much as one mini-mall ever went up in
this city without some grease being laid into the palms downtown. You’re
not naive; you know it’s a cost of doing business. Ordinarily you don’t
have to face it. Well, I face it, and a lot worse, into acynic–that’s
the easy way out, and I’m tougher than that. Strack gestures towards a
table-top architectural model of the Riverfront Development.</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: Take a look at that model, Julie. That was
my father’s dream. Now it’s my dream. Acres of riverfront reclaimed from
decay, thousands of jobs created, a building block–a very large building
block–laid for the future. Not such a bad dream, as dreams go. And if
the price of realizing that dream is the occasional distasteful chore,
well…</p>
<p>****: .the point is my father is well beyond the reach of the law,
but that memo could embarrass Strack enterprises.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: All right, you’re point is well taken. But
the fact remains that I’m in possession of evidence of the commission of
a crime. You can no more ask me to destroy it than I could ask you to
destroy one of your buildings.</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: Let me suggest this. You excuse yourself for
a few minutes, go to the ladies’ room, leaving your briefcase here. What
happens to the memorandum while it’s in my custody is my
responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>67 continued</strong>: Julie smiles.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I wish it were that simple. First of all, I
don’t have the memo with me. Even if I did–</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: It isn’t safe to have that document.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Are you threatening me?</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: moves closer, touching her arm.</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: I’m trying to protect you. Does. his lips,
wondering if he can tru Does the name Robert Durant mean anything to
you?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: He’s an underworld figure– racketeering,
drugs.</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: And real-estate. Robert Durant is competitor for
the river-front and knows about that document. He is a criminal, Julie.
And he will freelyat resort to criminal methods to get he wants. There’s
a pause.</p>
<p><strong>and</strong>: Well, you’re very eloquent, frankly I’m not
certain what I should do. You’ll have to trust me for a day or so to
figure this out.</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: Is that the most I can extract from you?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: For now.</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: I believe it is. Well then, my dear, I’m in
your hands.</p>
<p><strong>julie and two elder women</strong>: descend in the elevator.
Music is piped in from overhead speakers. it takes a moment before Julie
realizes what she’s</p>
<p><strong>hearing:</strong>: The song IM IR =E DARE Haunting. Sad. As
Julie listens, she becomes more and more affected.</p>
<p><strong>old woman #1</strong>: And you know he never said one bad
word to that girl. He never done wrong by her. She’s sure sorry now. He
was a rare one.</p>
<p><strong>old woman #2</strong>: Well, you find someone who loves you,
like Jim loved her, you shouldn’t give ’em up so easy.</p>
<p><strong>close on julie</strong>: The women’s remarks are not lost.on
her.</p>
<p><strong>70 int westlake lab - day 70</strong>: Peyton stands over the
projected microscope image on the computer monitor.</p>
<p><strong>peyton</strong>: Time?</p>
<p><strong>yaikitito</strong>: Ninety-six minute. A pause.</p>
<p><strong>yakitito</strong>: So, did you ask her?</p>
<p>****: Not yet, Yakitito, not yet. Time.</p>
<p><strong>yakitito</strong>: This is unbelievable! Every day–</p>
<p><strong>peyton</strong>: Time, Yakitito.</p>
<p><strong>yakitito</strong>: It still ninety six minute! Sounds to me
that maybe you didn’t ask her. Maybe your afraid?</p>
<p><strong>peyton</strong>: Look, I asked her. She said no, okay? Well,
she actually said “I don’t know”. Peyton stands and stretches. The
telephone rings, Peyton moves to answer it.</p>
<p><strong>peyton</strong>: I’ll get it.</p>
<p><strong>71 ext payphone - day -julie 71</strong>: is beaming as she
stands at a pay phone waiting for Peyton to answer.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: please be there Peyton.</p>
<p><strong>a hand</strong>: Juts out of the shadows and clutches at
Peyton’s wrist!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Don’t bother.</p>
<p><strong>peyton</strong>: We hold on his shocked face as the phone
rings and then stops.</p>
<p><strong>click!</strong>: A light hits Peyton’s face. He turns to
look.</p>
<p><strong>a tensor light</strong>: Pauly’s chunky outline flashes on in

<p><strong>another light</strong>: Rudy Guzman.</p>
<p><strong>another light</strong>: reveals the entire gang; Corky
Corcoran and a grinning Smiley stand side by side. Near them, Skip. In
the very back is Rick, looking a little green around the gills.</p>
<p><strong>peyton</strong>: looks wildly about.</p>
<p><strong>his pov</strong>: Panning from Skip to Rudy to Trumayne
to–Pauly’s fist, being launched directly into the camera.</p>
<p><strong>73 peyton</strong>: is knocked back across the lab table.
Glassware and equipment fly.</p>
<p><strong>pauly</strong>: pulls him up and slams him into the wall.</p>
<p><strong>peyton</strong>: sags down, then hauls himself to his knees
to behold:</p>
<p><strong>gold cigar trimmer</strong>: SNIP!–trimming the end of a
cigar, which is then brought to the mouth of…</p>
<p><strong>robert g. durant</strong>: towering above.</p>
<p><strong>durant</strong>: No foolish heroics, if you please. We have
come only for documentstell us where to find the Bellasarious memorandum
and we shall disappear– like a nightmare before the breaking day.</p>
<p>****: I don’t know what you’re talking</p>
<p><strong>73 continued</strong>: BAM–BAM–Pauly has grabbed him by the
hair and rams his head into the wall twice.</p>
<p><strong>74 durant 74</strong>: looking sadly down.</p>
<p><strong>durant</strong>: The Bellasaurious memorandum if you
please…</p>
<p><strong>peyton</strong>: I told you, I don’t know what you’re talking
about! CRACKLE–Yakatito Yanagita is thrust into frame, his mouth
stretched wide under the plastic bag that covers his head.</p>
<p><strong>durant</strong>: .Should your houseboy’s predicament not jog
your memory, you may bid him Godspeed.</p>
<p><strong>peyton</strong>: Stop it! Let him breathe!</p>
<p>****: You heard the doctor: Ventilate him. Rick steps forward,
unholstering a gun. Pointing it at the spot where Yakatito’s mouth gapes
under the plastic.</p>
<p><strong>peyton</strong>: surges forward but a vicious backhand blow
from Pauly sends him back to the floor. He raises his face just
as–BAM–an orange flash plays on Peyton’s horrified features. THUNK!
Yakatito drops into frame in front of him.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: With a trembling hand he holsters the gun. He
withdraws a bottle of pills from his jacket. He shakes out two and
swallows them dry.</p>
<p><strong>trumayne</strong>: emerges from the bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>trumayne</strong>: Bingo! He waves the coffee-stained
document that he has found.</p>
<p><strong>durant</strong>: Fine…</p>
<p><strong>75 trumayne and pauly</strong>: grab Peyton and ram him into

flaming hands, smothering them.</p>
<p><strong>82 durant 82</strong>: calmly puts out his cigar and opens
the valve on a green tank labeled: OXYGEN. Then another: ACETYLENE. He
places his electronic lighter under the beak of the drinking bird. Like
an oil rig, the bird’s beak bobs closer and closer to the switch on the
lighter.</p>
<p><strong>peyton</strong>: pulls himself to his knees, cradling the
smoking claws that were his hands. Durant lifts him to his feet.</p>
<p><strong>durant</strong>: Please, Remain calm. Let’s keep this
orderly. Resistance now would only prompt acts of pointless cruelty.
Durant gestures with a quick movement with his head.</p>
<p><strong>guzman and pauly</strong>: grab firmly ahold of Peyton’s
legs. They rush him forward and dunk his head into the electrified bath
of blue fluid.</p>
<p><strong>83 inside the bath peyton 83</strong>: face upside-down, eyes

erupt from his mouth.</p>

eats into his skin.</p>
<p><strong>83b smiley</strong>: grins with delight.</p>
<p><strong>83c peyton and the electrified bath</strong>: The SCREAM
subsides as the electricity short circuits and shuts down. Peyton’s limp
body falls out of frame.</p>
<p><strong>83d durant</strong>: surveys the wrecked lab, then hands
Trumayne his cigar trimmer. Softly:</p>
<p><strong>durant</strong>: Bring the Asian’s fingers.</p>

<p><strong>84 peyton</strong>: lies immobile.</p>

explosive mix of oxygen and acetylene.</p>
<p><strong>the drinking bird’s</strong>: beak inches closer to the
ignition button on the lighter.</p>
<p><strong>peyton</strong>: stirs slightly, his breath a twisted WHEEZE.
Slowly, he comes to his knees. Head and hands trailing smoke, he crawls
toward the bobbing bird and lighter.</p>
<p><strong>85 ext westlake lab/apartment building - twilight

up. Julie emerges from the cab and fishes in her purse for the fare. The
headlights of the limo sweep over her and away.</p>
<p><strong>86 peyton 86-</strong>: drags himself past the bay windows to
within a foot of the bobbing bird. The HISSING of the gas is loud.</p>
<p><strong>86a the beak of the drinking bird</strong>: dips closer to
the electronic lighter’s ignition button…</p>

us and the blast. An intense blue light fades up, brilliantly
backlighting Peyton. His stark shadow burns into us.</p>
<p><strong>90 silence - sam-o-cam rig - peyton</strong>: As he is thrust
off of his feet, and rocketed through the wall.</p>
<p><strong>91a</strong>: 91A Peyton’s rag doll body spins end over end,
upward towards the stars. Silently.</p>
<p><strong>91b</strong>: 91B It takes a moment for the SOUND of the
explosion to catch up with the blast– KAAABOOOOMMMM!!! Noise that makes
the earth shake.</p>
<p><strong>93 the sky - peyton dummy - night 93-</strong>: Peyton’s
flaming body plummets toward the earth like a comet. _</p>
<p><strong>95 ext - river - closer on peyton - night 95</strong>: He
floats like a dead man, flaming debris from the building SPLASHING down
around him. With a GROAN, he sinks beneath the murky water.</p>
<p><strong>b96 julie b 96</strong>: Julie pulls herself to her feet. She
stands in utter shock in a downpour of forks, knives and spoons. Before
her.</p>
<p><strong>p96 - peyton’s building burns</strong>: lke a hay stack.
Offscreen sirens WAIL.</p>
<p><strong>b 97 wider shot - julie - blue screen b97</strong>: She
stands in shock as.</p>
<p><strong>98 bits of charred paper - miniature - slow motion</strong>:
float-past her and the burning building beyond.</p>
<p><strong>the burning background fades away.</strong>: Night turns to
day as tombstones appear on either side of her. The falling bits of
paper change to falling leaves.</p>
<p><strong>b99.. julie - blue screen b99</strong>: She remains in the
exact same position. Her business suit becomes a black suit of
mourning.</p>
<p><strong>101 a limousine driver 101</strong>: leans against his
limousine, looking bored. He turns to the Gravedigger, an older man,
dressed in soiled work overalls who props himself up on his shovel.</p>
<p><strong>limo driver</strong>: Didn’t see you workin’ out there.</p>
<p><strong>gravedigger</strong>: Never found the guy’s body, just an
ear. Don’t take long to bury that. Now sometimes when this happens
folks’].]. be lookin’ for a discount. But see, it ain’t the diggin’ that
your payin’ for, It’s the real estate. They watch as…</p>
<p><strong>102 julie 102</strong>: buttons her coat and straightens
herself, attempting to gain resolve. She will put this behind her. She
walks toward the limousine but is suddenly hammered by grief. Her gait
wavers. Racked by sobbing, she falls. Tears stream from her eyes as she
clutches at the grass.</p>
<p><strong>103 a priest 103</strong>: helps her to her feet.</p>
<p><strong>104 julie 104</strong>: raises her tear soaked face and we
see the extent of her suffering.</p>
<p><strong>blue</strong>: The undifferentiated blue resolves itself, as
a ripplin blue fluid, resembling the acid bath in Peyton’s lab. A form
emerges from it’s depths; a completely bandaged head breaks the surface
of the fluid.</p>
<p><strong>107 wider 107</strong>: A patient is lifted from a hydro
tank, the complex water vessel in which burn patients are treated. He
lies perfectly still, hands and face swathed in gauze; A 20th- century
mummy. Tubes and wires.poke from his body. We hear the steady beeping of
a cardiogram.</p>
<p><strong>108 masked burn nurses 108</strong>: carefully strap the
mummy onto a hydraulically powered, multi-axied burn platform. Behind
him are other bandaged patients, some rotating on burn platforms, some
still submerged in their hydro-tanks.</p>
<p><strong>109 the resident physician and four interns</strong>: saunter
over to the hydraulic bed where nurses adjust the patient’s I.V.
tubing.</p>
<p><strong>resident</strong>: Here we have a 25-30 year-old-male, no
I.D., no medical history. Fished the guy out of the river with burns
covering over forty percent of his body. His hands and.face were the
most severe.</p>
<p><strong>110 a burn nurse</strong>: pushes a button. Motors grinding,
the hydraulic platform rotates, slowly spinning the mummified man. For a
brief moment he is upside down.</p>
<p><strong>resident</strong>: Ten years ago, pain from the burns would
have been intolerable. The guy would have spent the rest of his
screaming. Now we use the Rangeveritz technique; quite simply, we sever
his spino-thalamic nerve…</p>
<p><strong>resident</strong>: .Here. Which, as you know, transmits
neural-impulses of pain and vibratory sense to the brain.</p>
<p><strong>113 the hydraulic burn platform</strong>: continues its slow
rotation with the mummified patient now turned sideways.</p>
<p><strong>resident</strong>: No longer receiving impulses of pain, you
stick him with a pin…</p>
<p><strong>resident</strong>: .and he can’t even feel it. With a sharp
practiced motion, he plucks out the pin.</p>
<p><strong>resident</strong>: Of course, there are serious emotional
side effects to this operation. When the body ceases to feel, when so
much sensory input is lost, the patient becomes alienated. The mind, cut
off from its regular diet of input, has a never-satisfied thirst;
alienation gives rise to loneliness, anger; uncontrolled rage is not
uncommon. And the rage problem is exacerbated by the chemical effect of
severing the nerve. Now, surges of adrenaline flow unchecked through
body and brain– giving him the strength of dozen men. Hence the leather
restraints. The resident turns and heads for the door. The interns
follow behind like ducklings.</p>
<p><strong>resident</strong>: Naturally, we give him every chance of
recovery. He waves his hands about in futile circles letting the interns
know that this is the party line.</p>
<p><strong>resident</strong>: .Remain optimistic… inspire confidence…
Talk to him about rehabilitation potential… Personally? I give him a
nine on the buzzard scale.</p>
<p><strong>118 the loudspeakers 118</strong>: emit a loud warning
tone.</p>
<p><strong>public address</strong>: Code Blue, Burn Unit. All doctors
report. Code Blue, Burn Unit.</p>
<p><strong>119 the resident and interns 119</strong>: freeze for a
half-moment, turn and race back the way they came.</p>
<p><strong>and their “crash cart”</strong>: as they race pell mell down
the hallway, rubbing conductive jelly between the defibrilator
paddles.</p>
<p><strong>121 into burn unit - a hospital curtain 121</strong>: is
opened violently by a nurse. Her jaw drops in disbelief. Doctors and
technicians rush into the room and freeze.</p>
<p><strong>122 the resident 122</strong>: is the last to arrive. He
can’t see above the heads of the technicians and interns.</p>
<p><strong>resident</strong>: Alright, move. I’m in charge here! Lemme
through! He pushes his way to the front of the crowd and blinks stupidly
at the camera.</p>
<p><strong>123 peyton’s hydraulic platform. 123</strong>: Loose
bandages, torn leather restraints, and tangled E.K.G. wires dangle
aimlessly in the wind; a bright flash of lightning illuminates the empty
hydraulic bed.</p>
<p><strong>124 the resident’s hair 124</strong>: is suddenly blown back
by a gust of wind. Confused, he looks up from the bed and out the open
window.</p>
<p><strong>b124 through the open window b124</strong>: Dark storm clouds
billow over the city. Thunder crashes.</p>
<p><strong>127 close shot peyton 127</strong>: He slowly raises his
bandaged face from the mud. Desperate eyes peer out from a slit in the
muddied bandages. He forces himself to stand and move onward. He stops
in his tracks.</p>
<p><strong>128 his pov across the street - julie’s brownstone apartment
128</strong>: Julie steps from the stylish foyer and opens her
umbrella.</p>
<p><strong>peyton’s eyes</strong>: growing misty. He staggers across the
street after her.</p>
<p><strong>129 julie</strong>: terrified at the sight of…</p>
<p><strong>130 a hideous hand</strong>: clutching at her shoulder.
Scarred tendons and hand bones poke from unraveling bandages. They grip
tighter seeking help. Repulsed, Julie spins to see.</p>
<p><strong>131 dark figure/peyton</strong>: A vague, unrecognizable
shape in the shadows. From it comes the awful sound of an inhuman voice,
an unintelligible guttural rasp:</p>
<p><strong>dark figure/peyton</strong>: Juuuuulieeeeee. Heeeeeeeelp
meeeeeee…</p>
<p><strong>132 julie</strong>: A gasp caught in her throat, backs
away…</p>

behind his back. horror-hand andtuck eitlshamefully</p>
<p>****: It’s meeeeeee.</p>
<p><strong>3.34 julie</strong>: moves quickly away, her hand protecting
her throat. Her fear is mixed with pity as she turns away from this
monstrous man.</p>
<p>****: It’s me. But she is too far away to hear.</p>

<p><strong>141 a sewer drain 141</strong>: inches from his face. Rain
water spins round and round in a whirlpool. A scrap of newspaper is
swept into the current.</p>
<p><strong>142 peyton 142</strong>: stares at it.</p>

GOVERNOR BRYANT a red-faced man in his late forties. He sits at the head
of a crowded table.</p>
<p><strong>on the table</strong>: a huge cake, elaborately constructed
in the sleek shape of a sleek, modern skyline. The same as the model on
Strack’s desk.</p>
<p><strong>the governor</strong>: cuts one of the skyscrapers neatly in
half with the knife.</p>
<p><strong>loud applause</strong>: The Governor passes the piece to
LOUIS STRACK JR. who sits at his side.</p>
<p>****: As usual, Louis, you get the first piece of the action.
LAUGHTER…Strack takes a bite from the building’s top floors.</p>

sits at a bar a little away from the party area.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Vodka and lime, please. A double. A business
man, flushed with drink, observes her. He moves to the seat beside
her.</p>
<p><strong>businessman</strong>: Drowning your sorrows, eh?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Just giving them something to swim around in.
She drinks the vodka quickly. She sighs.</p>

beats a hasty retreat. Strack turns to Julie.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Thanks for getting rid of that guy.</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: Thank you for coming. I’m glad you’re here.
He takes her by the arm and starts to lead her across the crowded
floor.</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: I haven’t wanted to bother you during your
period of grief, but I have to know whether you’ve come to a decision
regarding the Belasarius Memorandum.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: The decision’s been made for both of us. The
papers were destroyed in the fire. I want to forget all about that–</p>
<p>****: The fire– the whole thing. . I’m quite disturbed by it. I can’t
help but wonder.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: Do you remember when I mentioned a certain
competitor of mine, Robert G. Durant?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: No. No. I’ve considered it. but the police
ruled out arson. It burned hot. A gas fire. There was an acetylene leak
– the tiniest spark</p>
<p><strong>could have–</strong>: She breaks off, getting choked up.
Strack’s manner is sympathetic and solemn.</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: Believe me, I am no stranger to the
frustration and anguish that comes from the loss of a loved one. He
forces himself to rally his spirits.</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: My dear, there’s no cure for grief</p>
<p><strong>except time–</strong>: He takes-her by the hand.</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: …But there is something that eases the

<p><strong>strack</strong>: Don’t be childish, I had every right. He
doesn’t want to lose you–said he’ll fight tooth and nail to keep you at
the firm. Good! I like a good scrap! If it’s not worth fighting for it’s
not worth having. Just consider that I won’t be outbid. Think about</p>

<p><strong>julie</strong>: resents being gripped and lectured to and
yet… she senses in Strack, a power and magnetism that holds her.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I’ll consider it… Strack smiles. As he sweeps
her around, her eye catches something. Her face tightens.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Mr. Strack, I don’t want to alarm you, but
who is that man, speaking with the Governor?</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: turns to look.</p>
<p>****: What’s bg doing here? SWISH PAN from Strack’s frozen
expression… through a blur of dancers to:</p>
<p><strong>robert durant</strong>: chatting with the governor. He
catches Strack’s eye.</p>

She sets down the drink.</p>

<p><strong>strack</strong>: Yes. Once upon a time. Married and in love –
deeply, deeply in love…</p>

<p><strong>julie</strong>: I’m sorry. Strack strains to conceal the
bitterness of his grief.</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: Private aircraft. over the Smokeys.
Painless. Quick. utterly pointless. You can fight a disease. Another
man? You can fight that too. But this… Quietly,_within himself:</p>

<p><strong>julie</strong>: It must have been a terrible time. I wondered
how you understood. About me. You’ve been very patient. And very kind.
Strack smiles warmly. He takes her hand.</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: God help us when there’s no more room in
this world for a little kindness…</p>

his head against the post.</p>

smiles charmingly at Darkman.</p>

places a wreath of flowers on it. Her eyes tear.</p>

Peyton she knew – smiling warmly at her.</p>

him. She stops, immobilized. Her jaw drops. Her eyes roll up into her
head and she faints.</p>

the side of Julie’s face. Gradually Julie regains consciousness.</p>

sunlight has burned through r the dapple of graveyard trees. A bubbling
skin bliste cracks open and smokes. His hand covers it.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Sold me, Peyton. Hold me and never let me go.
I’ve been so unhappy and I want you to hold me forever.</p>

<p><strong>julie</strong>: Peyton, it’s like you were never gone. I’m

kiss passionately. ve in the Dark theme comes on.</p>
<p><strong>our view</strong>: circles the lovers… as we pass around
Julie over to Peyton – who is no longer Peyton, but transformed
into:</p>
<p><strong>the darkman</strong>: his horrible scarred face pressed
against Julie’s. .then lets out an Julie’s eyes open. She reels
back.</p>
<p><strong>284 the darkman</strong>: bolting up from sleep, sweating
though his facial bandages. The vein in his temple throbbing, eyes livid
as a beast’s.</p>
<p>****: It’s Durant. Robert G. Durant.</p>
<p><strong>285 contin</strong>: He grasps a offscreen object with the
tweezers andit removes it from the formaldehyde solution. He pats dry
with a white cloth.</p>
<p><strong>durant</strong>: Get Rudy on the phone. Uh huh. Rudy …
Listen. Just shut up and listen. You get a little gift from Chinatown,
today? No? Well that coney that Pauly took is really stingin’ my ass… Uh
huh. No. We do it my way. You Tell Hung Fat that I’m coming by tomorrow
to make the pick-up personally. Either he coughs green or he becomes
part of my collection.</p>
<p><strong>durant’s hands</strong>: He places the object in a box, lined
with red velvet. He takes a long, admiring look. We get only a
glimpse.</p>

<p><strong>phone juncture box</strong>: An electronic bug attached to
one of the terminals gives off a flashing red light. A wire from the bug
leads to…</p>
<p><strong>a charred walkman tape-recorder</strong>: Its microcassette
spins. Filtered through it we hear Durant’s phone conversation
continue.</p>
<p><strong>durant’s voice</strong>: it would be a nice addition.</p>
<p><strong>guzman’s voice</strong>: Jew want me to be at your place …
around 8:30?</p>
<p><strong>durant’s voice</strong>: That would be just fine for me. We
are tracking off the cassette up a long cord that leads to a pair of
headsets worn by Darkman. His eyes glisten through the slits of his
bandages. A set of hands enter frame and crack him viciously across the
head. He sprawls backward, caught off guard.</p>
<p><strong>a switch blade</strong>: is shoved against his bandaged
throat.</p>
<p><strong>mugger 1</strong>: Hey shithead, give up the radio. And the
money. Like lightening, a skeletal claw lashes out.</p>
<p><strong>the bony pincer</strong>: SNAPS closed upon Mugger 2’s wrist.
The pincer twists sharply and we hear the awful CRACK of the mugger’s
wrist shattering.</p>
<p><strong>darkman’s eyes</strong>: gleam like a shark as it bites.</p>
<p><strong>mugger #1</strong>: SCREAMS, dropping the switchblade to the
pavement.</p>
<p><strong>darkman</strong>: turns to Mugger #2, as he pulls down the
bandages from around his mouth, revealing: a terrible maw of black and
crooked teeth, attached to a lipless jawbone. It jerks… and words come
out:</p>
<p>****: Run for your life.</p>
<p><strong>the muggers</strong>: flee in fear.</p>
<p><strong>dare 4an</strong>: contorts his face into a ghastly
interpretation of a smile, and slips back into the shadows.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: But why do you have to stay at this burn
center? You can stay at my place now.</p>
<p>****: No! No, it’s best, for now, till all the kinks have been
smoothed out —</p>
<p><strong>-</strong>: – kinks. Peyton glances at his watch. 97
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Peyton, I still don’t understand. Why didn’t
you come back to see me before now?</p>
<p><strong>peyton</strong>: Well… it’s like I told you. The burns left
some scars and… I was ashamed. Afraid. I was afraid that you wouldn’t
want me anymore.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Of course I still want you.</p>
<p><strong>peyton</strong>: But…what if I was…burned. So horribly
burned, that you couldn’t stand to look at me. Couldn’t stand to have me
touch you. What then?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Well…if that were the case… I don’t know. But
why even ask me that? The point is: You’re fine. Your back. Just like
always. She smiles. Peyton is filled with the warmth of being accepted
and wanted once again.</p>
<p><strong>peyton</strong>: Yeah. I am back, aren’t I? Just like
always.</p>
<p><strong>289 continued</strong>: From offscreen we hear Durant’s
recorded voice:</p>
<p><strong>durant’s voice</strong>: That would be just fine for me.</p>
<p><strong>the cat</strong>: sleeps. We hear the garbled chatter of the
audio tape being rewound. We are panning past the Walkman, which is
wired to the computer. The tape stops, then, as programmed, plays
again.</p>
<p><strong>durant’s voice</strong>: That would be just fine for me. We
pan past the back of the Darkman’s head. The - bandages have been
removed. Although his face is not visible, the singed hairless back of
his skull is. It is not a pretty sight.</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: The Darkman swabs a thick white paste, silvidine
burn ointment, upon his skeletal fingers.</p>
<p><strong>durant’s voice</strong>: That would be just fine for me. The
Darkman switches off the desk lamp and removes a mask from a black
lightproof bag. He examines it, returns the mask to the bag, then slips
it into his coat. The camera arcs around to see the bottom half of his
skeletal face.</p>
<p><strong>durant’s voice</strong>: That would be… CLICK–the Darkman
stops the tape mid-sentence and his own hideously charred mandible
finishes it:</p>
<p><strong>darkman</strong>: ..just fine for me.</p>
<p><strong>continued</strong>: �cw. f</p>
<p><strong>289 continued</strong>: The impression is good, though
slightly thick. The Darkman strokes his jawbone thoughtfully.</p>
<p><strong>p290 black-and-white view through rotating security camera

of a video camera. The harshly lit store has aisles of cheese whiz,

coat. The clerk takes a Fearful step back.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Hey-hey, take it easy, buddy!</p>
<p><strong>durant</strong>: Name ain’t buddy. It’s Durant. He waits for
the video security camera to pan to him and stop. He cheats in toward
the lens for a good clear close-up that fills the screen.. .Robert G.
Durant</p>
<p><strong>close shot–durant</strong>: Matching the previous shot except
that it is in color. He is speaking to someone just off camera.</p>
<p><strong>durant</strong>: Yeah, I’.m Robert G. Durant… The camera is
pulling back to reveal that he is</p>

facing cops. He glances at his watch.</p>

<p><strong>a gold cigar trimmer</strong>: Snipping a cigar. We follow it
up to the mouth of Robert G. Durant. His temple pulsates faintly.</p>
<p><strong>295 ext chinese restaurant - day</strong>: A large sign above
the entrance reads: “THE MANDARIN”. The Continental pulls up to the
curb. Trumayne waits in the car as Guzman and Darkman/Durant step out
into the bright morning sunshine.</p>
<p><strong>darman/durant</strong>: hesitates, calculating the intensity
of the sunlight. He sneaks a glance at his watch.</p>
<p><strong>close on watch</strong>: It reads; 90 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>the dar1 an</strong>: follows•L’uzman into the
restaurant.</p>
<p><strong>katz</strong>: .had it all on film. I almost didn’t get ’em
to post bail.</p>
<p><strong>durant</strong>: Just keep ’em out of my hair.</p>
<p><strong>katz</strong>: Hey where you going?</p>
<p><strong>the driver:</strong>: Jumps into a waiting taxi cab and
bellows at</p>
<p><strong>durant</strong>: The Mandarin! Fast! The cab PEELS out.</p>
<p><strong>hung pat</strong>: Wahbuht! So good of you to favor me with
your venerated presence! Please honor me by seating yourself in my
shabby chair! Darkman/Durant remains impassively standing.</p>
<p><strong>hung pat</strong>: . or do me the greater honor of remaining
on your feet!</p>
<p><strong>durant/ dariqian</strong>: The money.</p>
<p><strong>hung fat</strong>: The money! Yes! Wahbuht! How I tremble
with shame. How I hide my face. He elaborately does so with his
hands.</p>
<p><strong>guzman</strong>: Studies Durant/Darkman with uncertainty.
After another beat of uncomfortable silence, he decides to begin for his
boss.</p>
<p><strong>guzman</strong>: We no here for de bullshit, we here to pick
up de money and thas what we do.</p>
<p><strong>the darian</strong>: glances up at the harsh fluorescent
light. He runs a. hand across the artificial flesh’of his face, checking
for signs of decomposition. He sneaks a look to his…</p>
<p><strong>watch</strong>: 93 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>hung fat</strong>: How I regret having to burden you with my
miserable difficulties! I have no money! The Darkman’s eyes shift. He
was not expecting this. Hung Fat is waiting for an explosion. There is
none. Sensing an advantage, he presses on.</p>
<p><strong>hung fat</strong>: .The white powder no longer flows in iis
former volume. All a members of</p>
<p><strong>tong languish</strong>: in poverty…</p>
<p><strong>guzman</strong>: Studies the Darkman hard. How can he
tolerate this?</p>
<p><strong>hung fat</strong>: And of all your unworthy servants, Hung
Fat is the most destitute… As if in response to some silent signal, four
enormous and muscular Chinese men enter and stand, arms crossed, in a
threatening posture. Even Hung Fat’s own minable slaves sometimes ignore
his wishes, and attack those people whom Hung Fat cherishes most deeply!
Wahbuht, they know nothing of our golden friendship!</p>
<p><strong>guzman</strong>: is looking from Hung Fat to Durant/Darkman;
what’s wrong? Why doesn’t he do something?</p>
<p><strong>hung fat</strong>: So until that shining day – may it soon
come! – when I shall once again be able to honor you with bounty, I bid
you goodbye! Good bye, Wahbuht! He is shaking his hand, pressing his
advantage, invading his physical space and making mockery of him!</p>
<p><strong>hung fat</strong>: .. Wahbuht, goodbye!</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: can’t believe his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>the darxman</strong>: letting Hung Fat pump his hand like an
idiot. Hung Fat drops his hand. It dangles lamely at his side. The
Darkman walks over to a bamboo chair and slumps. closes his eyes and
sighs. He removes a cigar from his breast pocket. With his eyes
closed:</p>
<p><strong>darx24an</strong>: You will bring me the five million dollars
by the time I finish this cigar.</p>
<p><strong>but wahbuht–</strong>: SNIP’. Hung Fat flinches at what he
sees. The camera pans to the sound. the cigar to a third of its The
Darkman has just snippe d and puffs. former size. He lights</p>
<p><strong>hung fat</strong>: His mocking smile disappears as he
sees…</p>
<p><strong>extreme close shot–the cigar’s glowing tip</strong>: It fills
the bottom of the frame. Above, filling the top half of the frame: The
Darkman’s evil eyes, through the rippling heat of the cigar. Their
intensity pierces the shroud of smoke and burns holes into Hung Fat’s
soul.</p>
<p><strong>hung fat</strong>: dumbly nods. Without a trace of an
accent:</p>
<p><strong>hung fat</strong>: .Okay, Bob, you win.</p>
<p><strong>durant/d xnan’s cigar</strong>: is extinguished in an ashtray
as a briefcase is set down alongside it. Placed there by</p>
<p><strong>a burly vhinese warrior</strong>: who takes a step back,
alongside Hung Fat.</p>
<p><strong>durant/ darkman</strong>: grabs the case. As he exits the
office with Guzman he sneaks a look at:</p>
<p><strong>the digital stopwatch</strong>: it reads: 97 minutes. Click.
98 minutes. DUR.ANT/DART AN and GUZMAN head for the revolving doors.</p>
<p><strong>300 durant/ darkman’ s face</strong>: A tiny skin blister has
bubbled up on his light-sensitive facial mask. His hand comes up to
smooth it out.</p>
<p><strong>durant/darkman</strong>: spins, caught. CONTINUED</p>
<p><strong>a burly chinese body-guard</strong>: approaches quickly,
pointing at Durant/Darkman’s face.</p>
<p><strong>hold it!</strong>: He reaches into a pocket, pulls out…
…Durant’s monogrammed lighter, which he hands to Durant/Darkman.</p>
<p><strong>body guard</strong>: Your lighter.</p>
<p><strong>302 ext mandarin restaurant - real durant</strong>: as he
runs up to Trumayne and Smiley who are waiting in the Continetal.</p>
<p><strong>real durant</strong>: where is he?!</p>
<p><strong>trumayne</strong>: Where’s who?!</p>
<p><strong>real durant</strong>: Guzman.</p>
<p><strong>trumayne</strong>: I thought he was with you!</p>
<p><strong>real durant</strong>: sprints for the restaurant.</p>
<p><strong>303 int mandarin restaurant - durant/darkman</strong>:
clutching the briefcase as he follows Guzman through the revolving
doors. Guzman exits onto the street. But as Durant/Darkman revolves
through the door, he slams suddenly to a halt. In the next chamber of
the revolving door he sees…</p>
<p><strong>real durwt</strong>: whose disbelieving face moves closer to
get a better look.</p>
<p><strong>the two durants</strong>: dressed identically, stare at each
other through the glass in eerie confrontation.</p>
<p><strong>guzman</strong>: stands upon the sidewalk, gaping in
wonder.</p>
<p><strong>guzman</strong>: Dios Mio! Aye que papa!</p>
<p><strong>durant/ darxman</strong>: shoves the door forward, dislodging
the stunned Real Durant. He rotates past Guzman and points to the Real
Durant, revolving behind him.</p>
<p><strong>guzman</strong>: draws his gun and waits, sweating.</p>
<p><strong>t o</strong>: spins past the incredulous him to the Durant
shoot him. Real Durant points</p>
<p><strong>shoot him!!!</strong>: The revolving doors whirl faster.
Round he goes.</p>
<p><strong>guzman</strong>: nods, recalibrates his orders and stands
ready to fire.</p>
<p><strong>durant/darkman</strong>: spins past him.</p>
<p><strong>guzman</strong>: doesn’t know who to plug.</p>
<p><strong>304 motion control rig - durant 304</strong>: leaps out onto
the street.</p>
<p><strong>a second durant</strong>: leaps out onto the street. They
face each other. Who’s who? It’s impossible to tell. Only the briefcase
of cash distinguishes one from the other.</p>
<p><strong>the two durants</strong>: go directly for each other’s
throats. The briefcase falls to the ground. They call to Guzman.</p>
<p><strong>don’t just stand there…</strong>: Real Durant’s face is spun
out of frame and replaced with Durant/Darkman’s exact replica.</p>
<p><strong>guzman</strong>: waves his gun back and forth, from one
Durant to the other.</p>
<p><strong>durant</strong>: slams Durant’s face against the brick wall
of the restaurant. One Durant falls to the pavement, clutching his head,
groggy.</p>
<p><strong>guzman</strong>: raises an uncertain gun to the standing
Durant.</p>
<p><strong>b304 standing durant</strong>: backhands Guzman viciously
across the face–CRACK!</p>
<p><strong>standing durant</strong>: Son of a bitch set me up with the
cops and you practically hand him the cash!</p>
<p><strong>guzman</strong>: watches warily as Standing Durant picks up
the briefcase.</p>
<p>****: What the hell you lookin’at?! SHOOT</p>
<p><strong>p304 guzman</strong>: retrains his gun on the fallen Durant
who covers his face. But before he fires, he gives a final glance to
Standing Durant.</p>
<p><strong>305 standing durant</strong>: The sunward side of his face is
bubbling and blistering, revealing glimpses of a skull beneath.</p>
<p><strong>standing durant/darkman</strong>: What are you, deaf?! He
notes a wisp of smoke and knows the jig is up. He slams the briefcase
into Guzman’s face – THWACK! – knocking him to the ground. The Darkman
sprints down the sidewalk through the crowd.</p>
<p><strong>real durant</strong>: climbs to his feet, holding his
bleeding head. He backhands Guzman across the face–CRACK! He grabs
Guzman’s gun and runs after his alter-ego.</p>
<p><strong>guzman</strong>: woozily pulls a snub nosed .45 from his
ankle holster and gamely follows.</p>
<p><strong>durant/darxman</strong>: races down the street, leaving a
thin trail of yellow smoke. He halts at a busy intersection. Cars speed
past. No way to cross. He turns to the sound of gunshots.</p>
<p><strong>real durant</strong>: gun in hand, and closing fast. A cart
filed with crates is wheeled directly in his path. Real Durant
gracefully leaps atop the crates, and never letting up his rain of fire,
springs from them. While in free-fall, he ejects the spent cartridge and
snaps in a fresh clip. He lands . firing!</p>
<p><strong>we</strong>: in a shower</p>
<p><strong>next</strong>: hear the frightened scatter.</p>
<p><strong>308 darkman’s face</strong>: is in the process of cellular
fragmentation. His mask emits tiny jets of blue flame. He runs for a
subway entrance.</p>
<p><strong>309 durant and guzman</strong>: They are gun- follow after
the th em fire e at nce. toting T umayne. DAlll three of o</p>
<p><strong>close shot - darkman/durant</strong>: His smoking face
reveals no pain, only puzzlement. He vaults over the turnstile and races
down the platform.</p>
<p><strong>durant, rudy, and trumayne</strong>: note the blood as they
reload.</p>
<p><strong>durant</strong>: Got you.</p>
<p><strong>311 contib’ ed</strong>: They ju p the turnstile with guns
drawn and look about for the Darkman. Commuters scatter. Durant spots
something lying on the platform. He picks It up.</p>
<p><strong>the th33ng</strong>: is slims and translucent. Durant holds
it to the light. It’s the mask of his own face. It smolders and melts.
He f1Ligs it away.</p>
<p><strong>312 the melting facial mask</strong>: sticks to the tiled
wall of the subway next to Guzman and Trumayne. Durant’s nose and cheeks
melt together into a sickening goo.</p>
<p><strong>313 guzman and trumayne</strong>: step back, sickened.</p>
<p>****: Me cago en Dios, I can no believe dis shit.</p>
<p><strong>durant</strong>: notes drops of blood which lead off the
platform and down into the dark subway tunnel.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: We ain’t going in dere are we?! Durant pulls a
tiny penlight from his pocket and leaps from the platform onto the track
bed.</p>
<p>****: Goddamn it man… We follow some pendejo without a face… into a
goddamn hole in de ground…</p>
<p><strong>durant</strong>: holds up his hand commanding silence as-they
come to an intersection of subway tunnels. Both lead into darkness. They
listen, but all is quiet. They speak in hushed tones.</p>
<p><strong>trumayne</strong>: Now what?</p>
<p><strong>durant</strong>: You go that way. We’ll take this one.</p>
<p><strong>trumayne</strong>: doesn’t look too thrilled by the prospect
of being alone in the tunnels.</p>
<p><strong>trumayne</strong>: Alone?</p>
<p><strong>durant</strong>: No. Take a fucking squad of marines with
you!</p>
<p><strong>durant</strong>: tosses him the penlight. Hard. Casually he
lights a cigar and continues forward.</p>
<p><strong>trumayne</strong>: watches Durant and Guzman disappear down
the tunnel. The sound of their footsteps recedes. Trumayne’s breathing
is shallow. He loosens his necktie and unbuttons his collar. He takes a
breath.</p>
<p><strong>trumayne</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>ta-ckang! clang!</strong>: Trumayne flinches. He points the
penlight in the direction of the clanging sound.</p>
<p><strong>it</strong>: An empty wine bottle at his feet is illuminated.
rolls to a stop against the tunnel wall. He listens. Silence.</p>
<p><strong>trumayne</strong>: Gettin’ jumpy. Like Rick. A faint cough
comes from the blackness ahead.</p>
<p><strong>trumayne</strong>: raises the penlight.</p>
<p><strong>the feeble light beam</strong>: cannot pierce he darkness.
Trumayne bends down and picks up the bottle, keeping his fearful eyes on
the darkness ahead. The cough again.</p>
<p><strong>trumayne</strong>: heaves the bottle at the sound.</p>
<p><strong>316 slow motion - wine bottle</strong>: as it tumbles end
over end into the darkness.</p>
<p><strong>317 trum1</strong>: waitsr the crash, ready to fire at
anything that moves.. -</p>
<p><strong>his</strong>: Black. No sound.</p>
<p><strong>trumayne</strong>: still waiting, nerves on edge. Where’s the
crash?!</p>
<p><strong>his poy</strong>: The oppressive dark.</p>
<p><strong>trumayne</strong>: shudders Something in the darkness has
swallowed the bottle. He begins to back out of the tunnel the way he
came. He freezes in the center of a tunnel intersection at the sound of
FOOTSTEPS. Crunching on gravel; Approaching. He fingers the gun’s
trigger. Empty tunnels on all sides. The FOOTSTEPS quicken.</p>
<p><strong>trumayne</strong>: Mr. Durant?! Panicked, Trumayne shines his
light in front of him. Empty tunnel. The FOOTSTEPS come faster,
closer.</p>
<p><strong>trumayne</strong>: Guzman?! He jerks his penlight to the
tunnel behind him. Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>317 continue-</strong>: To his right… nothing. To his left…
nothing. He’s trying to see all the tunnels at once. He spins
desperately, firing into each of them.</p>
<p><strong>gun barrel</strong>: spits flame–BLAM!</p>
<p><strong>a tunnel</strong>: is illuminated by the brilliant flash of
the gun. Empty. The light fades.</p>
<p><strong>gun barrel</strong>: spins and fires – BOOM!</p>
<p><strong>trumayne’s eyes</strong>: are lit up. Crazed with fear. The
illumination fades.</p>
<p><strong>gun barrel</strong>: spins and spits sparks–BEAM!</p>
<p><strong>another tunnel</strong>: illuminated–empty. The light
fades.</p>
<p><strong>p318</strong>: P318 TUNNEL</p>
<p><strong>b318 the darkman. . illuminated. . unmasked!</strong>: The
split-second flash has caught him pouncing in mid-air.</p>
<p><strong>..,: b318 contin d</strong>: For the first time, we see the
complete nightmare. Only the uppw right quarter of Peyton’s face remains
intact. Perfect., Handsome. But as for the rest… The 3i,a is a hairless
skull, covered with random bits of scaranf char. Without the benefit of
gums or lips, the entire 3ength of his teeth are exposed down to the
root, connec g crookedly to the jaw bone. One ear remains intact, the
other a burnt hole. Only the rudimentary cartile forms the nose. But it
is the wild eyeballs protruig obscenely from the bone of their sockets,
that tell tba,story. There, lies madness; a dark river of evil rage.</p>
<p><strong>319 durant and guzman</strong>: They hear Trumayne’s throaty
SCREAM, then silence. They run toird the sound. When they arrive, they
see only the penlight laying upon the track bed. It’s dull glow shines
upon the wet walls of the tunnels. Nearby they find the gun and one of
Trumayne’s shoes.</p>
<p><strong>guzman’s eyes</strong>: look like saucers.</p>
<p><strong>durant</strong>: even looks a little scared.</p>
<p><strong>guzman</strong>: Oh shit, man. What did he do, man… eat him?
From the tunnel ahead, FOOTSTEPS approach. The two men squint,
attempting to pierce the blackness.</p>
<p><strong>guzman</strong>: Trumayne?! The FOOTSTEPS grow louder.
Closer.</p>
<p><strong>guzman</strong>: .Hey, amigo, dat chew?! From the darkness, a
figure emerges and runs at them.</p>
<p><strong>durant and guzman</strong>: raise their rods and blast:</p>
<p><strong>blammity-blam!</strong>: The dark figure, lurches and
collapses upon the ties. A shaft of light reveals it to be…</p>
<p><strong>trumayne</strong>: gagged, with his hands tied behind his
back, a wild look of terror in his dead eyes.</p>
<p><strong>durant and guzman</strong>: gape stupidly at the body before
them. They glance fearfully to one another through the fog of
gunsmoke.</p>
<p><strong>durant</strong>: looks about, gets control, loads a fresh
clip into his gun with an echoing SNAP.</p>
<p><strong>guzman</strong>: waves his arms in surrender.</p>
<p><strong>guzman</strong>: Good Bye. Das it. I’m outta here… Durant
grabs him.</p>
<p><strong>durant</strong>: Where the hell are you going?</p>
<p><strong>guzman</strong>: pulls free.</p>
<p><strong>wooooooodoooooooooooooi!1!!11</strong>: Durant looks wildly
over his shoulder as he runs for his life.</p>
<p><strong>323 the trailf</strong>: Two thousand tons of unforgiving
steel is barreling down upon his. One hundred feet away and
closing…Thirty feet Ten…</p>
<p><strong>324 the front wheels of the train</strong>: ROAR atop the
track. Durant’s feet slower moving, enter view just ahead.</p>
<p><strong>b325 tracking with darkman’s boney jaw</strong>: Lit by the
flying blue sparks it emits an evil laugh. Tunnel walls zip past in the
background.</p>
<p><strong>326 pulling durant</strong>: He runs, the train gigantic
behind him. Durant’s face is stretched in panic. The cigar is still in
his mouth, between clenched teeth. He fixes on something ahead.</p>
<p><strong>327 his pov - a section of raised subway track</strong>: in
the middle of the track, a shallow depression.</p>
<p><strong>328 durant’s feet</strong>: running only a shoe’s length
ahead of the sparking wheel.</p>
<p><strong>329 pulling durant</strong>: as he desperately leaps for the
depression in the tracks. He appears to go down right under the
train.</p>
<p><strong>330 under the track - durant</strong>: hugging the shallow
depression. Is he low enough? The underside of the train comes roaring
over us.</p>
<p><strong>vr00000000mi</strong>: The train begins its long roar past.
We hear an AGONIZED SCREAM that is either the train or Durant – or some
ungodly combination.</p>
<p><strong>the tunnel wall</strong>: is illuminated with a flash of
light.</p>
<p><strong>white.</strong>: from the light pouring out the passing train
windows.</p>
<p><strong>train wheels</strong>: throw blue sparks into the
darkness.</p>
<p><strong>low angle</strong>: The long subway train rolls into the
distance. It’s rumble fades. Quiet. Durant’s cigar smoulders on the
tracks.</p>
<p><strong>331 durant himself</strong>: rises quietly into frame. His
suit is still clean. He appears remarkably unscathed. He runs a hand
through his hair, turns and walks slowly along the tracks. That’s when
we see his back: the train has raked off the fabric of his suit and
pants, exposing bare back and buttocks. Somehow maintaining his dignity,
Durant picks up the smouldering cigar from the tracks. He takes a puff
and moves off.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: We cut from Darkman’s ravaged monster-face
to:</p>
<p><strong>333 julie</strong>: beautiful as ever.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: – Peyton! Where have you been? Why haven’t
you called?</p>
<p>****: Can I–can I see you? CLINK! The bullet is dislodged from the
wound and drops on the table.</p>
<p><strong>335 people screaming</strong>: Various close shots of
screaming patrons on the Tilt-A A-Whirl, their faces hideously distorted
by wind, centrifugal force, and their mouths stretched wide to
scream.</p>
<p><strong>merry-go-round horses</strong>: Various close shots of
leering horses bobbing up and down. We are at a carnival.</p>
<p><strong>peyton</strong>: laughing, his face restored, walking down
the midway, one arm draped over Julie’s shoulder. She laughs with him.
Peyton glances at his watch.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Put away that watch or I’ll think you don’t
like me anymore. Oh, Peyton, let’s spend the whole day together – the
whole week! A beat.</p>
<p><strong>peyton</strong>: I’ve got to tell you, Julie… I’ve got to
tell you something about – about me – how I’ve changed. Julie turns.</p>
<p><strong>peyton</strong>: In the fire – I – I A voice offscreen rises
above the general noise:</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: See the mutant man, half man, half beast!
Witness this prodigy of science with your own eyes! Peyton whirls
around.</p>
<p><strong>peyton’s pov - a sideshow barker</strong>: soliciting
pedestrians to a side-show.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: What?</p>
<p>****: Never mind.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: What’s going on, Peyton? What are you keeping
from me?</p>
<p><strong>335 cont</strong>: Peyton Ares at Julie. He can’t bring
himself to tell her.</p>
<p>****: C’mon, I’m going to win you the biggest’ fuzziest pinkiest
animal doll on that rack. Something you’ll-be truly embarrassed to own…
and then I’ve got to run. They have stopped in front of a booth where
softballs get tossed at bottle pyramids. Peyton lays down a dollar and
is handed three balls.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Why do you always have to run? Peyton looks
at the pyramid, avoiding her look. He throws the first ball; misses.
-</p>
<p><strong>peyton</strong>: I. have my treatment… I’m not a hundred
percent cured yet–but I soon will be. He throws the second ball;
misses.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Can I take you back to the burn center?
Peyton’s vein begins to throb faintly.</p>
<p><strong>peyton</strong>: No! No, please. I don’t want you to see me
there. I don’t want you to think of me as…an invalid or… some kind of
f–ff-fff–FREAK! On that word he throws the last ball with great force.
The pyramid explodes. Peyton, breathing heavily, takes a moment to
collect himself, then says quietly to the booth attendant:</p>
<p><strong>peyton</strong>: …The pink elephant, please. The bored
attendant, a cigarette dangling from his lower lip, shakes his head.</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: Sorry buddy. It don’t count if you ain’t
standing behind that line.</p>
<p><strong>peyton</strong>: I was behind the line.</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: Not hardly.</p>
<p><strong>336 peyton’s vein</strong>: pulses.</p>
<p><strong>peyton</strong>: I was standing right here. Next to my
girlfriend. Now. The pink elephant, .if you please!</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: Na way. Julie tugs at his sleeve.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Peyton, it doesn’t matter. Peyton is fighting
to contain his rage. in clipped words, between gasps for breath:</p>
<p><strong>peyton</strong>: It matters. I won a pink elephant. For my
girlfriend.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Peyton… It’s okay…</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: Get lost, buddy.</p>
<p><strong>338 brief cuts</strong>: People screaming on the
Tilt-A-Whirl. Merry-Go-Round horses bobbing up and down. Calliope music
gets louder and louder.</p>
<p><strong>339 peytonn</strong>: Shaking under the pressure of contained
rage, his vein bulging, throbbing. Under his-breath:</p>
<p><strong>peyton</strong>: The elephant… Quickly! The attendant
unwisely pushes two fingers into Peyton’s chest. We rocket into a close
shot of the offending digits. From of fscreen, we hear the attendant’s
voice:</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: You heard me, weirdo. Get lost!</p>
<p><strong>341 crack!</strong>: The counter dissolves into a million
fissures, as do the stuffed animals on the shelves above.</p>
<p><strong>342 peyton’s face</strong>: Twitching violently, vein swollen
to bursting. The camera races into an eyeball to find:</p>
<p><strong>peyton</strong>: Screaming. A skin blister bubbles on his
cheek.</p>
<p><strong>347 attendant’s two fingers</strong>: Against Peyton’s chest.
Peyton grabs them and–CRACK- breaks them.</p>
<p><strong>348 wider</strong>: The attendant screams. Peyton screams
with him. Julie screams as well.</p>
<p><strong>350 fuzzy pink elephant</strong>: is yanked violently from
the shelf.</p>
<p><strong>351 peyton</strong>: shoves it at Julie. In a voice hoarse
with rage:</p>
<p><strong>peyton</strong>: Take it!</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Peyton! No!</p>
<p><strong>peyton</strong>: ’Take it!</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Please!</p>
<p><strong>peyton</strong>: Forgive me! He runs off, the fuzzy pink
elephant still clasped, forgotten, beneath one arm.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Peyton!</p>
<p><strong>darxman</strong>: disappears around a corner, trailing thin
wisps Of smoke.</p>
<p><strong>360 julie 360</strong>: who has seen it all from the
shadows.</p>
<p><strong>362 darkman’s eyes 362</strong>: roll toward the noise. He
steps back into the shadows.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Peyton?! 364 No answer. She cautiously
advances. Her eyes fall 364 upon something that makes her gasp.</p>
<p><strong>365 the pink elephant 365</strong>: ripped to shreds, it’s
white stuffing all over the place. 366 He moves forward towards a
darkened corner of 366 the lab.</p>
<p>****: Peyton?! I need to talk to you. She halts at a site in front of
her.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Dear God.</p>
<p><strong>367 the darkman’s lab</strong>: Beams of light cut through
the darkness to reveal it; The charred holographic imagers, computers,
and the rebuilt bio-press all sit atop large wooden crates.</p>
<p><strong>w hich 368</strong>: 368 Beyond, two lab tables, made chains.
oldoors, them hang suspended from the ceiling by tubes, and beakers of
liquid skin. In the place of i the bge 66’aF rdpMustangcserveseas
salvaged bucketeseathofean o the lab chair.</p>
<p><strong>369 the spotted cat</strong>: eats from a discarded pizza
box. Despite it’s eerie nature, the layout and feel of the lab is
hauntingly familiar.</p>
<p><strong>370 julie</strong>: backs away frightened, right into.</p>
<p><strong>the limp and wrinkled head of peyton</strong>: hanging from a
hook.</p>
<p><strong>371 julie</strong>: her hand trembles as she lifts the
eyeless face into frame. She forces herself to examine it closely. Her
the revulsion gives way to pity. She brings it into beam of light.</p>
<p><strong>s372 julie’s hand holds the mask -</strong>: Accomparaed by
the sound of BUZZING FLIES and SIZZLING Skin blisters boil furiously.
She drops it</p>
<p><strong>374 darkman</strong>: Presses bimself into the shadows.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Peyton. .?</p>
<p><strong>375 darkman</strong>: turns his head sharply. Only the upper
right corner of his face falls into the light. The handsome, undamaged
portion.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Why didn’t you tell me? If you loved me, why
didn’t you tell me?</p>
<p><strong>376 darkman</strong>: shamed, to be both coward and monster,
clutches his bony hand to his skull.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: You had no right–</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: coward!</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Do you think it was the face I cared about?!
Is that how little you think of me?! Why didn’t you come to me?</p>
<p><strong>379 darkman</strong>: He is shaken by a silent sob. More of
his face falls into light, illuminating leathery neck muscles and
hideous bone.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I would have helped you. She stares into the
shadows a long time without speaking.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Don’t you know I love you, Peyton? And no
matter what–no matter what you’ve become I’ll always love you?</p>
<p><strong>381 close on darkman</strong>: his eyes expressing a ray of
hope he didn’t think possible until now. O.S. We hear the sound of</p>
<p>****: Julie… Julie.</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: Huhh??:!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Julie Hasting’s to see you, Mr. Strack.</p>
<p><strong>383 continu</strong>: Strack43 eyes dart nervously to the
door.</p>
<p>****: lb…</p>
<p>****: Very well… He stands. A coin or two falls from his dimpled ass
as he reaches down for his pants.</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: Julie, how sweet of you to come before our
appointed hour… but I expected– you in something a little more formal.
Didn’t Ruth inform you that we have tickets to Der Fliedermause
tonight?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I can’t go, Louis. We have to talk.</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: Excellent! I love to talk. Brandy?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Thank you, no.</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: I’ll have one;_ As he walks to a bar and
pours himself a drink.</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: …Fair warning–it’s Napoleon, and it’s quite
good–</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Louis, I can’t see you anymore.</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: Darling, settle down. Don’t be rash. As you
say, let’s talk.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: You know about Peyton, the man I was</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Louis, he’s alive. He’s back. He was burned,
horribly, horribly burned–I don’t understand what happened but I know he
needs my help. Strack is visibly taken aback. He sets the brandy
down.</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: .Your news has a bittersweet flavor… Of
course I’m very happy for you. If there’s anything I can do– the finest
medical care can be at your disposal–burn therapy, recon- structive
surgery. How badly was he… mutilated? Julie has broken down. She sits
down on Strack’s sofa, her body wracked with sobs.</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: … Where is he, Julie?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: He’s living in an abandoned warehouse. He’s
alone… he needs me. The phone RINGS. Strack crosses to the desk and
picks it up.</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: Not now!… Who?… All right, I’ll take it in
the other room. He looks up at Julie.</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: I won’t be a moment. He walks into an
adjoining room. He picks up the phone.</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: Yes, Franz… And the closing price?…</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: She reaches for a tissue. Next to it is.</p>
<p><strong>her pov</strong>: Strack’s briefcase sitting on top of his
desk.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Wipes a tear from her eyes. She moves
closer.</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: I feel sufficiently diversified… Franz, it
is immaterial to me what the market is doing. I want you to buy…</p>
<p><strong>julie’s pov</strong>: A sheaf of papers stick up above the
mouth of the briefcase.</p>
<p><strong>close on the papers</strong>: A dark coffee stain.</p>
<p><strong>back to julie</strong>: As she pulls the papers from the
briefcase.</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: Yes, you did hear me correctly. I want you
to buy. Ten thousand Krugerands. Fresh ones!</p>
<p><strong>strack’s voice</strong>: Yes. The Belasarious memorandum.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: whirls to face him. He stands looking down
over her shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: .I’m sorry you had to find that, dear. Our
relationship didn’t need this further strain.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: The fire… it wasn’t an accident, it was
you.</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: Not me personally. I have an employee who
does certain things for me, unofficially, off the books. Robert doesn’t
like to pay taxes.</p>
<p>****: And now you’ll kill me. Strack_ spreads his arms.</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: Hardly. You have nothing on me, my dear, and
you’d find the extremely expensive police department quite
unsympathetic. . Julie. Consider the big picture.</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: I suppose this is goodbye then. Julie stares
hatefully at him for a beat, then hurries out the door.</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: Send Robert in. Strack strolls over to the
window and stares out at his rising city. OS the door clicks open.</p>
<p><strong>robert g. durant</strong>: enters the room.</p>
<p><strong>i strack</strong>: Robert! I have good news and bad.</p>
<p><strong>durant</strong>: Custom dictates that you render the bad news
first.</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: You recall the little difficulty with my
father and how you resolved it. We have a similar situation with Miss
Hastings. It seems Miss Hastings has uncovered some unflattering
information about us.</p>
<p><strong>durant</strong>: No problem at all. And the good news?</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: Your wife died. I’m joking, of course. No,
the good news is that I know who’s behind our little troubles of late.
When you retrieved my memorandum, you failed to excise the good
doctor.</p>
<p><strong>durant</strong>: Westlake? He’s dead. I saw to it myself.</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: He’s alive. I don’t like loose ends, Robert.
Finish it.</p>
<p><strong>durant</strong>: Okay. Where is he? Strack smiles.</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: I believe we have a guide.</p>
<p><strong>tracking with julie</strong>: as she crosses the street. The
street is silent, desolate… Suddenly from out of nowhere,</p>
<p><strong>a midnight blue continental - undercranked</strong>: races
toward her, about to run her over–</p>
<p><strong>the continental - undercranked</strong>: SCREECHES to a stop,
only inches from her.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: turns to run.</p>
<p><strong>another lincoln continental</strong>: SCREECHES to a halt
behind her, sandwiching her in. She tries to make a break for the
warehouse.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Peyton!! Guzman races out of one continental,
Smiley out the other.</p>
<p><strong>julie!</strong>: He races toward the door.</p>
<p><strong>machine gun fire</strong>: shatters the three windows and
doors of the warehouse. Darkman climbs a steel rung ladder and heads for
the roof.</p>
<p><strong>budda-budda-budda!!</strong>: The rooftop is riddled by
bullets.</p>
<p><strong>a helicopter</strong>: rises suddenly into frame, over the
edge of Peres a roof. leaning , o undin h h machine gun , p g t e roof
with gunfire.</p>
<p><strong>durant</strong>: Peg ’em!</p>
<p><strong>a door</strong>: is kicked open as Smiley and Guzman enter,
guns ps blazing, shooting the lab to hell. The gunfire sto and the lab
is quiet. Guzman speaks quietly into a walkee-talkee.</p>
<p><strong>guzman</strong>: we’re in.</p>
<p>****: He just went down from the roof.</p>
<p><strong>guzman</strong>: Glances above to the darkened rafters
ofathence one to warehouse. Then, signals for Smiley way. He will go
another. They split up.</p>
<p><strong>395 guzman’s p.o.v. 395</strong>: The place is eerily still;
we hear only an occasional computer beep.</p>
<p><strong>guzman</strong>: …Holy San Juan de fuckeen Capistrano!</p>
<p><strong>397 a dozen human faces 397</strong>: hang on parallel
clothes lines. Durant, Pauly, Skip, and Smiley. In the shadows, their
eyeless heads are wrinkled and grotesquely life-like. 398 Guzman moves
through the gallery of faces. A breeze 398 through the open window makes
the clothes-line SQUEAK as the faces bob and nod to him. 399 He stops
suddenly. His body shudders at the sight of… 399</p>
<p><strong>400 a face 400</strong>: his own. Hanging on a hook.</p>
<p><strong>401 guzman 401</strong>: panics, backs into a rack of
clothing, knocking it over. . he races past the wigs, the faces…running
for his life…</p>
<p><strong>402 two skeletal hands 402</strong>: emerge from the darkness
and latch around his throat! Guzman is yanked backward into the
blackness without so much as a peep.</p>
<p><strong>403 smiley</strong>: moves through the dimly lit lab area.
Gun out, checking every crevice.</p>
<p>****: Come in, Smiley, come in! Come–</p>
<p><strong>the footsteps</strong>: 405 Smiley turns off the
walkee-talkee. i m. are almost atop him. He takes a</p>
<p><strong>406 smiley’s p.o.v. - a second smiley</strong>: racing out of
the darkness at him.</p>
<p><strong>407 smiley</strong>: is hip to the Darkman’s game. He smiles.
The gun belches flame at the masked figure.</p>
<p><strong>408 the masked smiley</strong>: crumples to the floor. The
bottom portion off fece Smiley mask is wrinkled, exposing a portion
beneath.</p>
<p><strong>409 smiley</strong>: peEjz back the mask with the barrel of
his gun revealing. . GUZMAN!!</p>
<p><strong>410 smiley</strong>: loses his smile. A third Smiley stands
slowly into frame behind the spooked Smiley.</p>
<p><strong>smiley #3/dapyman</strong>: Good shootin’.</p>
<p><strong>triplicate and</strong>: looks from the dead Smiley to his
short as the SHRIEKS! But it’s mercifully cut Darkman is upon him.</p>
<p><strong>durant</strong>: Guzman, come in! Smiley! Guzman! What the
fuck is going on down there?! A burst of STATIC. Then:</p>
<p><strong>darkman’ s voice</strong>: I am. Durant drops the
walkee-talkee as if it were something hot.</p>
<p>****: Take her down!</p>
<p><strong>412 continued</strong>: The pilot lowers the throttle stick
and</p>
<p><strong>412a</strong>: 412A the chopper swoops down.</p>
<p><strong>413 a whirl cf pebbles</strong>: as the helicopter descends
on the roof of the warehouse.</p>
<p><strong>durant</strong>: I want that son of a bitch eliminated! And I
don’t want his fingers, I want his fucking head!</p>
<p><strong>skip and corky</strong>: run out onto the roof, assault
rifles in hand.</p>
<p><strong>crash! crash! crash!</strong>: Skip and Corky whirl around as
iron shutters slam down over the windows and doors, sealing the lab into
an airtight prison.</p>
<p><strong>open gas valves</strong>: HISS, filling the room with the
explosive mix of oxygen and acetylene.</p>
<p>****: You’re next.</p>
<p><strong>durant</strong>: Where are you?! Pilot.and Durant look toward
the entrance of the warehouse. The door is closed. Suddenly…</p>
<p><strong>to</strong>: WHOMPI–a bandaged hand slams into Durant’s chest
grab bim and start hauling him towards the door. The Darkman is dragging
him out towards the roof.</p>
<p><strong>what the fuck is that?!</strong>: Durant mashes the Darkman’s
arm with the door:</p>
<p><strong>darkman</strong>: is yanked from his feet.</p>
<p><strong>the helicopter</strong>: climbs, lifting the Darkman clear of
the rooftop.</p>
<p><strong>h417 the plastic bird</strong>: it bobs up. and down. The
same toy that destroyed Peyton’s lab. Durant’s lighter lies on a
platform just under the beak of the drinking bird. It bobs closer and
closer to the switch on the lighter, about to make contact.</p>
<p><strong>417a skip 417a</strong>: dives for it, snatching it… .the
hand clenches empty air. The bird is a transparent holograph. Skip turns
in horror. HIS POV–nearby is the real bird, bobbing in’synch with the
holograph.</p>
<p><strong>extreme close shot - the real bird’s beak</strong>: dips
closer to the electronic lighter’s ignition button. Closer… closer…</p>
<p><strong>418 the darkman 418</strong>: gropes desperately at the floor
of the helicopter for a handhold. His fingertips barely touch a rope
ladder.</p>
<p><strong>419 durant 419</strong>: slides open the steel door and kicks
viciously at his face, knocking him overboard.</p>
<p><strong>420 the helicopter 420</strong>: rising straight up as the
Darkman tumbles backwards in free fall, back towards the roof.</p>
<p><strong>- 421 darkman 421</strong>: His overcoat flapping as he
somersaults down, he throws out one arm and…</p>
<p><strong>b422 close shot - blue screen - darkmanis hand b422</strong>:
…catches the last rung of the rope ladder that trails from the copter.
It SNAPS taut as–</p>
<p><strong>p423 miniature - ext warehouse - p423</strong>: –KA-BOOM!!
The roof below him blows.</p>
<p><strong>b424 blue screen b424</strong>: The arm is by the snap of</p>
<p><strong>b426 darkman b426</strong>: is barely able to hold onto the
ladder. Below him, P426 the tiny city is a spinning blur of metal and
asphalt and P426 glass.</p>
<p><strong>427 pilot 427</strong>: He pulls the stick. Gradually the
helicopter rights itself.</p>
<p><strong>428 the helicopter 428</strong>: banks sharply through the
concrete canyons–a deadly game of crack the whip.</p>
<p><strong>the dean</strong>: is hurled through the window of an office
on the 70th floor of a skyscraper.</p>
<p><strong>a board meeting</strong>: The executives stare in shock at
the Darkman standing on their table.</p>
<p><strong>darkman’s pov</strong>: The faces of the executives whirling
in a circle like numbers on a roulette wheel.</p>
<p><strong>432 on the street below</strong>: pedestrians scurry from the
rain of falling glass. Camera swishes up to reveal…</p>
<p><strong>433 the helicopter</strong>: as it roars away from the
skyscraper at an insane angle, the pilot having finally managed to
regain some control.</p>
<p><strong>durant</strong>: Dip him!</p>
<p><strong>434 the helicopter</strong>: angles sharply toward a busy
freeway.</p>
<p><strong>435 darkman</strong>: is dipped into oncoming traffic. He
barely clears the roof of a Cadillac by swinging his legs above it.</p>
<p><strong>436 the helicopter</strong>: swoops lower.</p>
<p><strong>the daricman’ s legs</strong>: dangle six feet above the
ground, whizzing over the asphalt at 100 miles per hour. The legs part
as they pass over a motorcycle, then close again.</p>
<p><strong>437 the helicopter</strong>: swoops lower, slamming the
Darkman to the pavement. He drags for a moment, a pack of motorcycles
WHIZZING past his head. Like a marionette, he’s jerked back up right in
front of an oncoming 1973 Delta 88 Oldsmobile. He is grazed by the car’s
hood. His body bounces off the windshield.</p>
<p><strong>438 darman</strong>: is lifted straight into the path of a
fast-moving truck. Truck HONKS furiously. Darkman strains his legs.</p>
<p><strong>close-up</strong>: TRACKING over the truck’s aluminum
roof.</p>
<p><strong>the darxman’s feet</strong>: run 80 miles an hour along the
roof of the truck. Darkman manages to loop the bottom rung of the rope
ladder to a steel hook on the truck’s cab.</p>
<p><strong>439 helier</strong>: Looking forward over Durant’s and
pilot’s shoulders. The:pa3at has the stick. We are rushing directly town
an overpass.</p>
<p><strong>440 truck adof</strong>: The ladder snaps taut against the
hook.</p>
<p><strong>he li c</strong>: We are about to be obliterated.</p>
<p><strong>p441 the overpass</strong>: rushing up.</p>
<p><strong>p442 truck roof</strong>: Wind whipping at his coat, looking
up at the doomed helicopter, the Darkman bellows in triumph.</p>
<p><strong>b442</strong>: B442 Wind whipping at his coat looking up at
the doomed helicopter, the Darkman bellows his triumph.</p>
<p><strong>p443 overpass</strong>: taking up the entire screen.
–impact–KABOOM!</p>
<p><strong>b444</strong>: B444 Darkman, LAUGHING on the truck, races
through the darkness,</p>
<p><strong>444a</strong>: 444A flaming debris from the helicopter
cascading over the mouth of the tunnel.</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: We’ve consolidated the waterfront, Governor
…Yes, I’m aware there’s been some unpleasantness but that’s over now.
Yes, I’m sure. You sound a little nervous, Bryant. Have a brandy, watch
a cop show. The door opens. A security officer appears.</p>
<p><strong>security officer</strong>: Robert Durant, sir.</p>
<p>****: Send him in.</p>
<p>****: Goodbye, Governor. Everything’s taken care of. He hangs up. We
hear the door open and close. Strack’s smile vanishes.</p>
<p><strong>robert durant</strong>: enters. He looks awful–face scorched
and bruised, severe limp.</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: You look like hell, Robert.</p>
<p><strong>durant</strong>: The son of a bitch malfunctioned my
helicopter.</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: And Westlake?</p>
<p><strong>durant</strong>: ’f ie man’s a cockroach. You think you ;tall
him, and he pops up someplace , Ise. A beat.</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: g expect he’ll pop up here soon.</p>
<p>****: if Westlake calls, kindly refer him to Strack Towers.</p>
<p>****: Come, Robert, let us kill the girl.</p>
<p><strong>p44</strong>: P446 stars all around us.</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: I’m glad you survived, Robert. I’d hate to
see your kids deprived of a role-model.</p>
<p><strong>durant</strong>: They do look up to me. The elevator grinds
to a halt and the two emerge. The lights of the city tremble over the
water. A glitter and breadth to the landscape, an urban grandeur.</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: Kids need an example, Robert. When I was a
young man my father made me work high steel. That’s how he started out,
and in his view what was good enough for him was good enough for me…</p>
<p><strong>p446 contikued</strong>: Strack gestures broadly with one
arm.</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: …It was just me and the Indians, no one else
crazy enough to run around up here, against the wind, four-fifty an
hour. Sure I resented it, but now– call me crazy–sometimes I miss it, it
sharpens your wits. Life on the edge. Five inches wide. Two hundred
fifty feet down. High steel… He turns to face Durant. There’s a gun in
his hand.</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: You don’t have any kids, Robert.</p>
<p><strong>durant</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: Or should I say, Doctor Westlake?</p>
<p><strong>dur ant</strong>: I’m Durant! Robert G. Durant!</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: Then I’m going to make a mistake. There’s a
long beat. The vein begins to pulse on Durant’s temple. His eyes grow
predatory, evil.</p>
<p>****: Where’s the girl? Strack hops nimbly out onto a narrow girder.
He smiles back over his shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: You want to see the girl? Follow me, I’ll
take you to her… Durant/Darkman follows, taking the first few tentative
steps.</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: …I must say, Dr. Westlake, you’ve certainly
worked some mischief. Pretty much wiped out the security arm of Strack
Industries. That’s okay. I’m a good sport… He leaps from beam to beam,
Durant/Darkman following cautiously behind.</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: …And I can handle my own problems. I do
whatever I have to do. In fact, that’s how I got my first properties. My
wife–late wife–held certain deeds… I sent her on a plane trip over the
Smokies and well, let’s just say ;landed on My feet…</p>
<p>****: .as for my father, well, he was old, I spared him a few
miserable years… Yes, we all have dreams, Dr. Westlake, but we don’t all
have what it takes to realize those dreams.</p>
<p><strong>durant/darkman</strong>: All I have are nightmares. A
beat.</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: Then share my dream. After all, you and I
are pretty much the same. We should be working together. Both smart
fellows. Similar styles. Same taste in women. I could use a man like
you.</p>
<p>****: Go to hell.</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: Eventually, eventually… He proceeds nimbly
along the beam.</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: I guess you just don’t have what it takes. I
gather you run around wearing other people’s faces now, since yours is
so… loathsome. He shrugs.</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: .See I could never do that. The world has to
take me as I am. And all this tit-for- tat stuff you’ve been up to.
Silly. Living in the past. ; only destroy to build something better,
whereas You..• ah, here we are.</p>
<p><strong>durant/darkman</strong>: Julie! Strack laughs.</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: Bring on the strings! Young lovers! In
peril! Separated by ruthless forces, larger than they!–What a banal
tale. In it, I suppose I play the villain. But wait, Julie–which of us
is the monster here?! With this he reaches over to Durant
and–SQUISHHHRIPPP!! – tears his face off, tossing it over the edge..</p>
<p><strong>449 julie</strong>: gazes at Darkman’s ghastly visage for the
first time, overcome by horror and repulsion. Darkman’s vein pulses like
csa y.. Strack”s tone is almost admiring:</p>
<p><strong>str.ack</strong>: You truly are one ugly son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>blam!</strong>: Strack shoots Darkman in the shoulder,
hurling him off the bean. The Darkman tumbles, limbs flailing, bellowing
with rage.</p>
<p><strong>the world</strong>: Spinning upside down–stars, abyss, stars,
abyss–</p>
<p><strong>girder</strong>: As Darkman’s fingertips clamp onto the upper
lip of an I-beam… barely hanging on, vein pulsing.</p>
<p><strong>on the upper girder</strong>: Strack looks down, wind
whipping his hair. HIS POV– nothing. Darkman has been swallowed up by
the night. Pocketing his gun, Strack proceeds toward Julie.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: recoils as Strack stops in front of her. He
touches her hair.</p>
<p>****: First my wife, then my father, and now</p>
<p><strong>you–</strong>: He places his hands on her shoulders,
preparing to push her off the girder. With intensity:</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: -It is the tragedy of my life that I always
have to kill the ones I love. As he’s about to push her:</p>
<p><strong>a voice behind him</strong>: IDuis ! Strack turns around.</p>
<p><strong>strack jr.</strong>: Father?</p>
<p>****: I should’ve snuffed you out at birth! With that Strack Sr. rips
off his own face, exposing the enraged visage of Darkman… Strack reaches
for his gun.</p>
<p><strong>451 bam!</strong>: Darkman mashes his face and the gun flies
out of his hand into the darkness below.</p>
<p><strong>of</strong>: battle it out on the narrow girder, hundreds of
feet sure death on either side of them.</p>
<p><strong>bam! bam! bam!</strong>: Savage punches send Strack
reeling–BAM!–he falls onto the girder… nearby are a bunch of tools…
Strack crawls toward them.</p>
<p><strong>a rivet gun</strong>: only a few inches from his grasp.</p>
<p><strong>dariom</strong>: swoops onto Strack, pummelling him.</p>
<p><strong>stracr’s hand</strong>: inching painfully toward the rivet
gun.</p>
<p><strong>darkman</strong>: pummelling, lost in the act of his final
revenge. He steps back to give a final blow… .and slips on some loose
rivets, flailing for balance.</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: lunges. CLANG! Darkman slams into a vertical
bar.</p>
<p><strong>strack</strong>: Now you get to watch your girl-friend die.
He moves toward a terrified Julie.</p>
<p><strong>darxman</strong>: SHRIEKS and reality melts around him as he
tastes the hot soup of rage.</p>
<p><strong>454 crack!</strong>: Gigantic fissures appear on all the
girders… we spin into Darkman’s eyeball to find–</p>
<p><strong>455 the ultimate rage montage 455</strong>: Nightmarish
flashes of laughing faces jeering into the camera; Julie and Strack
kissing, naked. 456 Strack’s face bobs, attached now to the body of the
456 dunking bird, his nose nearing the ignition of a huge lighter. As
contact is made the lighter explodes in a shower of gold Krugerands. 457
The gold coins fall away to reveal Peyton’s unscathed 457 head, bobbing
on a freakish and deformed doll’s body. Atop a circus platform, he does
an angry jig. He wears a funny little hat. 458 Peyton’s face liquefies
and flows off his head to reveal- 458 the face of the Darkman. 459 A
drop of liquid Peyton falls upon… A cube of ice. It 459 bursts into
flames. 460 The camera races back from Darkman’s eye.. his vein 460
pulsing madly.</p>
<p><strong>461 darxman’s riveted hand 461</strong>: insensitive to pain,
he pulls, every sinew concentrated on the task. GGGGGGGG ! A horrible
grating sounds as the first rivet rips through steel… One hand is freed.
GGGGGGG ! .The other is freed.</p>
<p><strong>462 strack 462</strong>: with his back to him, doesn’t have a
chance to turn as:</p>
<p><strong>darkman</strong>: pounces. He lifts him full into the air.
Strack’s legs and arms flail impotently.</p>
<p><strong>arrrrrrrggggggg !</strong>: Darkman hurls him up, up into the
air. 463 Strack rises helpless, flailing his limbs… then begins 463 to
fall, yards away from the girder. 464 He spins, end over end,
to–PPHHHHFFFTHHMP!–be impaled 464 on the rebars many floors below, next
to Durant’s face.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Peyton, I can help.</p>
<p><strong>darkman</strong>: No one can help.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I don’t care how you look, Peyton! I. love
you. The burns don’t matter. There’s a long pause. Then Darkman turns
the twisted remains of. his face toward her. Julie sees them in
close-up. CLAMP! The elevator jars to a halt on street level.</p>
<p><strong>darkman</strong>: Take my hand. Julie stares at the charred
skeletal fingers. She overcomes her repulsion and puts her hand in
his.</p>
<p><strong>darkman</strong>: It disgusts you.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: No. Darkman stares at her a long time,
anguished, torn.</p>
<p><strong>darkman</strong>: This hand… it used to caress you. Now it
can only tear, rip away at things.</p>
<p>****: But you’ll perfect the skin. You’ll get rid of the scars.</p>
<p><strong>darkman</strong>: It’s not just the scars. I’ve changed- He
grips his skull.</p>
<p><strong>darkman</strong>: –inside. He pulls the elevator open.</p>
<p>****: I can live with it now, but I don’t think anyone else can.</p>
<p>****: I want it back. The two of us–the way it was… Darkman’s voice
breaks:</p>
<p><strong>darkman</strong>: What we had–our life together–it belonged
in the light of day. He disappears into the darkness.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Peyton! Darkman’s voice floats back as he
stalks away:</p>
<p><strong>darkman</strong>: Peyton is gone… 466 He heads into the
shadows. At the edge of the darkness 466 he pulls a mask from his coat
