<h1 id="harold-and-maude">harold-and-maude</h1>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: I suppose you think this is very funny,
Harold.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: Hello. Fay, darling. Be a dear and
cancel my appointment with Rene this afternoon. Yes, I know he’ll be
furious, but I’ve had the most trying day, and with guests coming this
evening… Would you? Oh, that’s sweet. Tell him I promise to be in
Tuesday… for a rinse. Thank you, Fay. You’re a darling. Yes. Yes.
Bye.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: Dinner at eight, Harold…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: … And try to be a little more
vivacious.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: Needless to say, the first time it
happened I was absolutely abashed. I was so shook I needed three
tranquilizers to calm me down. Well, you can imagine. Suicide notes all
over the house - “Goodbye,” “Farewell,” “Arrivederci.” Other children
pretend to run away from home, but Harold - he’s so dramatic.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: Of course, Harold’s father had a
similar sense of the absurd. I remember once in Paris he stepped out for
cigarettes and the next I hear he’s arrested for floating nude down the
Seine - experimenting in river currents with a pair of yellow rubber
water wings. Well, that cost quite a little bit of “enfluence” and
“d’argent” to hush up, I can tell you. Harold, dear, stop playing with
your food. Don’t you feel well?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I have a sore throat.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: Well, I want you to go to bed directly
after dinner. You know how susceptible you are to colds. Harold has
always been a delicate child. Even as a baby he seemed to be abnormally
prone to illness - Harold, dear, eat up your beets…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: Oh! No! Oh! No! I can’t stand it. My
God! This is too much. This is too much to bear!…</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: Tell me, Harold, how many of these,
eh, suicides have you performed?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: An accurate number would be difficult to
gauge.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: And why is that?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Well, some worked out better than others -
some had to be abandoned in the planning stages - do you include the
first time? - then there’s the question of maiming…</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: Just give me a rough estimate.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Well, a rough estimate… I’d say fifteen.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: Fifteen.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: A rough estimate.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: And were they all done for your
mother’s benefit?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I wouldn’t say “benefit.”</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: No, I suppose not. How do you feel
about your mother?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I don’t think I’m getting through to Mother
like I used to.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: Does that worry you?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Yes. It does.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I put a lot of effort into these things.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: Ah, yes.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: And a lot of time.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: I’m sure. But what else do you do with
your time? Do you go to school?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: What about the draft?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: My mother spoke to my Uncle Victor. He’s in
the Army and he fixed it up.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: Oh. Well, how do you spend your
day?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: You mean when I’m not working on a…</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: Yes. What kind of things do you
do?</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: I see. Junkyards. What is the
fascination there?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: Is it the machines? The noise? The
people?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: No. It’s the junk. I like to look at
junk.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: What else do you like?</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: That’s very interesting, Harold, and I
think very illuminative. There seems to be a definite pattern emerging.
Your fondness for useless machines and demolitions seems indicative of
your present emotional state, your self-destructive urges and your
alienation from the regular social interaction. What do you think? And
of course this pattern once isolated can be coped with. Recognize the
problem and you are half way on the road to its solution. But tell me,
what do you do for <u>fun</u>? What activity gives you a different sense
of enjoyment than the others? What do you find fulfilling? What gives
you that certain satisfaction?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I go to funerals.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: Why you purchased that monstrous thing
is totally beyond me. You can have any car you want - a Porsche, a
Jaguar, a nice little MG roadster - but that ugly, black horror is an
eyesore and an embarrassment. Really, Harold, you are no longer a child.
It’s time for you to settle down and stop flitting away your talents on
these amateur theatrics - your little “divertissements” - no matter how
psychologically purging they may be. I don’t know what to do.</p>
<p><strong>uncle victor</strong>: I’d put him in the Army, Helen.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: Go have a talk with your Uncle Victor.
Perhaps he can fathom you. After all, he was General Bradley’s right
hand man.</p>
<p><strong>uncle victor</strong>: Harold, your mother has briefed me on
your situation and there is no doubt in my mind of the requisite
necessary action. If it was up to me I’d process your file and ship you
off to boot camp tomorrow. Your mother, however, is adamant. She does
not want you in the Army and insists on my holding on to your draft
records. But what do you say, Harold? It’s a great life. Action!
Adventure! Advising. See war - firsthand! Plenty of slant-eyed girls. It
will make a man out of you, Harold. You’ll travel the world. Put on the
uniform and take on a man’s job. Walk tall! - with a glint in your eye,
a spring in your step, and the knowledge in your heart that you are - -
working for peace, and - are serving your country.</p>
<p><strong>uncle victor</strong>: Like Nathan Hale. That’s what this
country needs - more Nathan Hales.</p>
<p><strong>uncle victor</strong>: And, Harold, I think I can see a
little Nathan Hale in you.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: I only have a few minutes, Harold, but
I do want to inform you of my decision. There is no doubt that it is
time for you to settle down and begin thinking about your future. You
have led a very carefree, idle, happy life up to the present - the life
of a child. But it is time now to put away childish things and take on
adult responsibilities. We would all like to sail through life with no
thought of tomorrow. But that cannot be. We have our duty. Our
obligations. Our principles. In short, Harold, I think it is time you
got married.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: And so dear brethren, let us pray to the
Lord, King of Glory, that He may bless and deliver all souls of the
faithful departed from the pains of hell and the bottomless pit, deliver
them from the lion’s mouth and the darkness therein, but rather bring
them to the bliss of heaven, the holy light, and eternal rest.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Psst.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Like some licorice?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Eh, no. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: You’re welcome. Did you know him?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Eh, no.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Me neither. I heard he was eighty years old.
I’ll be eighty next week. A good time to move on, don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: I mean, seventy-five is too early, but at
eighty-five, well, you’re just marking time and you may as well look
over the horizon.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: I’ll never understand this mania for black. I
mean no one sends black flowers, do they? Black flowers are dead flowers
and who would send black flowers to a funeral? It’s change! How
absurd.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: There, that’s better. They never give the
poor thing a chance to laugh. Heaven knows she has a lot to be happy
about. In fact… - they all have a lot to be happy about. Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: And why do they keep on about that? You’d
think no one ever read the end of the story.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: It’s a question of emphasis, you might say.
Accentuate the positive, so to speak.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Eh, could I have my pen back now,
please?</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Oh, of course. What is your name?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Harold Chasen.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: How do you do? I am Dame Marjorie Chardin,
but you may call me Maude.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Nice to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Oh, thank you. I think we shall be great
friends, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Can I drop you anywhere, Harold?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: No, thank you. I have my car.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Well then, I must be off. We shall have to
meet again.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Do you dance?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Do you sing and dance?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Eh, no.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: No. I thought not.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: That woman… She took my car.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: I have here, Harold, the forms sent out
by the National Computer Dating Service. It seems to me that as you do
not get along with the daughters of my friends this is the best way for
you to find a prospective wife.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: Please, Harold, we have a lot to do and
I have to be at the hairdresser’s at three. The Computer Dating Service
offers you at least three dates on the initial investment. They screen
out the fat and ugly so it is obviously a firm of high standards. I’m
sure they can find you at least one girl who is compatible. Now first,
here is the personality interview which you are to fill out and return.
There are fifty questions with five possible responses to check… “A -
Absolutely Yes, B - Yes, C - Not sure, D - No, E - Absolutely No.” Are
you ready, Harold?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: “Four - Do you often invite friends to
your home?” Now, you never do, Harold. Absolutely no. “Five - Do you
enjoy participating in clubs and social organizations?” You don’t, do
you? Absolutely no. “Six - Do you enjoy spending a lot of time by
yourself?” Absolutely yes. Mark “A.” “Seven - Should women run for
President of the United States?” I don’t see why not. Absolutely yes.
“Eight - Do you have ups and downs without obvious reason?” You do,
don’t you, Harold? Absolutely yes. “Nine - Do you remember jokes and
take pleasure in relating them to others?” You don’t, do you, Harold?
Absolutely no. “Ten - Do you often get the feeling that perhaps life
isn’t worth living?” Hmm. What do you think, Harold?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: “A”? “B”? We’ll put down “C” - “Not
sure.” “Eleven - Is the subject of sex being over-exploited by our mass
media?” That would have to be “Yes,” wouldn’t it? “Twelve - Do you think
judges favor some lawyers?” Yes, I suppose they do. “Thirteen - ….</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: … Is it difficult for you to accept
criticism?” Nooo. We’ll mark “D.” “Fourteen - Do you sometimes have
headaches or back aches after a difficult day?” Yes, I do indeed.
“Fifteen - Do you go to sleep easily?” I’d say so. “Sixteen - Do you
believe in capital punishment for murder?” Oh, yes. “Seventeen - Do you
believe churches have a strong influence to upgrade the general
morality?” - yes, again. “Eighteen - In your opinion are social affairs
usually a waste of time?” Heavens, no! “Nineteen - Can God influence our
lives?” Yes. Absolutely yes. “Twenty - Have you ever crossed the street
to avoid meeting someone?” Well, I’m sure you have, haven’t you, Harold?
“Twenty-one - Would you prefer to be with a group of people rather than
alone?” That’s you, Harold. “Twenty-two - Is it acceptable for a
schoolteacher to smoke or drink in public?” Well, with reservation. Mark
“B.” “Twenty-three…”</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: … Does your personal religion or
philosophy include a life after death?” Oh, yes, indeed. That’s
“Absolutely.” “Twenty-four - Did you enjoy life when you were a child?”
Oh, yes. You were a wonderful baby, Harold. “Twenty- five…”</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: … “Do you think the sexual revolution
has gone too far?” It certainly seems to have. “Twenty- six…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: Harold! Please! “Should evolution be
taught in our public schools?!”</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Psst! Psst!</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Eh, my boy. A moment, please. Who was that
old lady waving to you earlier?</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Hello, Harold. Can I give you a lift?</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Ah! There you are, madam. Were not you the
lady who drove my car off yesterday?</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Was that the one with the St. Christopher
medal on the dashboard?</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Then I suppose it was me. Get in, Harold.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Were you also the one who painted the
statues?</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Oh, yes. How did you like that?</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Well, I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Oh, don’t be too discouraged. For aesthetic
appreciation - always a little time.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: But wait…</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: What a delight it is, Harold, to bump into
you again. I knew we were going to be good friends the moment I saw you.
You go to funerals often, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Oh, so do I. They’re such fun, aren’t they?
It’s all change. All revolving. Burials and births. The end to the
beginning and the beginning to the end - - the great circle of life. My,
this old thing handles well. Ever drive a hearse, Harold?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Well, it’s a new experience for me. Good on
curves. Shall I take you home, Harold?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: But this is my car.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Your hearse?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Yearse!</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Then you shall take me home.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: And so just before he left for the monastery
in Tibet, Big Sweeney gave me his keys.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Of course, I’ve had to make some additions
for the new models, but not as many as you might think. Once you have
your basic set it’s then only a question of variation.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: And you get into any car you want and just
drive off?</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Not <u>any</u> car. I like to keep a variety.
I’m always looking for the new experience, like this one. I liked
it.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Thank you. But when you take these cars
don’t you think you are wronging the owners?</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: What owners, Harold? We don’t <u>own</u>
anything. It’s a transitory world. We come on the earth with nothing,
and we go out with nothing, so isn’t “ownership” a little absurd?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Still, I think you’d upset people and I’m
not sure that’s right.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Well, if some people are upset because they
feel they have a hold on some things, then I’m merely acting as a gentle
reminder - I’m sort of breaking it easy – Here today, gone tomorrow, so
don’t get attached to <u>things</u>. Now, with that in mind, I’m not
against collecting stuff…</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: … I’ve collected quite a lot of stuff in my
time.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: It’s all memorabilia, but incidental and not
integral, if you know what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: It’s very interesting.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Oh, look! The birds.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: This is my daily ritual. I love them so much.
The only wild life I see anymore. Free as a bird! You know, at one time
I used to break into pet shops and liberate the canaries, but I gave it
up as an idea before its time. The zoos are full and the prisons
overflowing.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: She’s very sweet, but so old- fashioned.
Please sit down, Harold. I’ll put on the kettle and we’ll have a nice
hot cup of tea.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Thank you, but I really have to go.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: But it’s oat straw tea. You’ve never had oat
straw tea, have you?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Well then.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Thank you, but it’s an appointment. I really
shouldn’t miss it.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Oh, at the dentist’s?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Sort of.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Well, then, you must come back and visit.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: My door is always open.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Promise?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Promise.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: Harold?</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: Harold?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: You don’t seem to be listening. I
asked do you have any friends?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: None at all?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Well, maybe one.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: Would you care to talk about this
friend?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: Is this a friend you had when you were
away at school?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: I see. Were you happy at school,
Harold?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: You liked your teachers?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: Your classmates?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: Your studies?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: Then why did you leave?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I burnt down the Chemistry building.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: We are not relating today, Harold. I
sense a definite resistance. A lack of true and helpful communication. I
find you a very interesting case, Harold, but this reluctance of yours
is detrimental to the psycho-analytical process, and can only hinder the
possibility of effective treatment. Do you understand?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: Very well. Now your mother tells me
she is arranging several dates for you with some young ladies. How do
you feel about that?</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: I see. Tell me, Harold, do you
remember your father at all?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: No. I’d have liked to.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I’d have liked to talk to him.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: What would you say?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I’d show him my hearse. And my room, and
stuff.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: What kind of stuff?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: Now listen, Harold, I have here the
three girls sent out by the Computer Dating Service.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: I’ve phoned them up and invited each of
them to have lunch with us before you take them out. The first one is
coming tomorrow at one. Luncheon at two.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: Now I want you to act like a gentleman
and make this girl feel at home.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: Hello, I’m Candy Gulf.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: How do you do. I’m Mrs. Chasen. Come
in.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: Harold is out in the garden. He’ll be
in in a moment. Let’s go into the den.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: You are at the University, Candy?</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: Yes, I am.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: And what are you studying?</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: Poli. Sci. With a home ec minor.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: Eh, Poli Sci?</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: Political Science. It’s all about what’s
going on.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: Oh, there’s Harold now.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: He seems very nice. Is Harold interested in,
eh, what’s going on? I think it’s such a super thing to study. And then,
of course, I can always fall back on home ec.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: Yes, that’s good planning. Tell me, are
you a regular, Candy, in this computer club?</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: Heavens no. I don’t have to worry about
dates. You see, the other girls in my sorority, well, we decided that
somebody should try it, so we drew straws and I lost. But I am looking
forward to meeting Harold.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: I think I should mention, Candy, that
Harold does have his eccentric moments.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: Oh, <u>yes</u>? Well, that’s all right. I’ve
got a brother who’s a real cut-up, too. I’ll never forget the time we
had this old TV set with no parts in it. Well, Tommy stuck his head
behind it and started giving a newscast before the whole family. We were
all hysterical. And here’s little Tommy pretending to be Walter
Cronkite.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: Yes. I’m sure it must have been very
funny.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: Har – Haro – Haroldddd!!!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: Yes, dear. Here is Harold now.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: Candy, this is Harold.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: Candy was just telling a funny story
about Walter Cronkite.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Maude. Maude. Anybody home?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Excuse me, have you seen Maude?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Maude. Do you know where she is?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Maude?</p>
<p><strong>madame arouet</strong>: Ah! Maude.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.
Merci.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Oh. Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>glaucus</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I’m sorry. I was looking for Maude.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Harold?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Maude???!</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: How about some ginger pie?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Eh, fine.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: I’ll heat some up. My, it’s nice to see you
again, Harold. How’s your hearse?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Oh, it’s fine. Fine.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: She seemed yare to me.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Do you often model for Glaucus?</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Heavens no! I don’t have the time. But I like
to keep in practice and poor Glaucus occasionally needs his memory
refreshed as to the contours of the female form. Do you disapprove?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Me! No. Of course not.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Really. Do you think it’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Oh, I’m so happy you said that because I
wanted to show you my paintings. This is the “Rape of Rome” and, of
course, there in the corner is quite a graphic depiction of Leda and the
Swan.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: A self-portrait. But over here is my
favorite. It’s titled “Rainbow with Egg Underneath and an Elephant.” Do
you like it?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Yes. Very much.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: It was my last. I then became infatuated with
these – my “Odorifics.”</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Give the nose a treat, I thought. Have a kind
of olfactory banquet! So I began first on the easiest - roast beef, old
books, mown grass, then I went on to these - “An Evening at Maxim’s.”
“Mexican Farmyard.” Here’s one you’d like. “Snowfall on 42nd Street.”
Put it on.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Now I’ll pump it up… … and you just turn the
handles. Okay. What do you smell?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Subways… Perfume… Cigarette… … Cologne…
Carpet… Chestnuts! … <u>Snow!</u></p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: It goes on and on.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: That’s really great.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Thank you. I thought of continuing -
graduating to the abstract and free-smelling - but then I decided to
switch to the tactile.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Oh. Eh, I like it.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: No, you have to touch it. You have to run
your hands over it, get close to it, really reach out and feel. You try
it.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: That’s right. How’s the sensation?</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Oh, that’s the kettle. Go ahead, Harold.
Stroke, palm, caress, <u>explore</u>.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Here we are, Harold. Oat straw tea and ginger
pie.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Certainly a new experience for me.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Wonderful! Try something new each day. After
all, we’re given life to find it out. It doesn’t last forever.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: You look as if you could.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Me. Ha! Did I tell you I’ll be eighty on
Saturday?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: You don’t look eighty.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: That’s the influence of the right food, the
right exercise, and the right breathing. Greet the dawn with the Breath
of Fire! Of course, there’s no doubt the body is giving out. I’m well
into autumn. I’ll have to be giving it all up after Saturday. Sweeten
the tea with honey, Harold. It’s delicious.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: That’s a nice teapot.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Sterling silver. It was my dear
mother-in-law’s, part of a dinner set of fifty pieces. It’s one of the
few things that survived. Oh, but I do rattle on so. Tell me about
yourself, Harold. What do you do when you aren’t visiting funerals?</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Yes. There is definitely a certain
attraction.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Well, it’s all very thrilling, of course, but
I ask you, Harold… Is it enough?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: I love to watch things grow.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: They grow and bloom, and fade, and die, and
some change into something else. Ah, life!</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: I should like to change into a sunflower most
of all. They are so <u>tall</u> and simple. And you, Harold, what flower
would you like to be?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I don’t know. Just one of those.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Why do you say that?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Because they are all the same.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Oooh, but they are not. Look.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: See - some are smaller, some are fatter, some
grow to the left, some to the right, some even have some petals missing
- all kinds of observable differences, and we haven’t even touched the
bio- chemical. You see, Harold, they’re like the Japanese. At first you
think they all look alike, but after you get to know them you see there
is not a repeat in the bunch. Each person is different, never existed
before and never to exist again. Just like this daisy - - an
individual.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Well, we may be individuals all right but -
- we have to grow up together.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Yes, that’s very true. Still I believe much
of the world’s sorrow comes from people who know they are this - - yet
let themselves be treated - - as that.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Ha! Power steering.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Boy, Maude. The way you handle cars. I’d
never handle a car like that.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Oh, it’s only a machine, Harold. It’s not as
if it were <u>alive</u>, like a horse or a camel. We may live in a
machine age, but I simply can’t treat them as equals. Of course, the age
has its advantages.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: The universal language of mankind. What music
do you like, Harold?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Look.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Over there by the courthouse.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: That little tree. It’s in trouble. Come
on.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Look at it, Harold. It’s suffocating. It’s
the smog. People can live with it, but it gives trees asthma. They can’t
breathe. See the leaves are all brown. Harold, we’ve got to do something
about this life.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: But what?</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: We’ll transplant it. To the forest.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: But we can’t just dig it up!</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: But this is public property.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Don’t you think we should get some tools,
maybe?</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Yes, you’re right. We’ll go see Glaucus. Come
on.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Oh, wait, Maude. Look!</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Oh, the police. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Good afternoon, Officer. Bit of trouble
here?</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Yes, ma’am. Somebody had some trouble
parking.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Well, it’s a tricky turn.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Eh, yes, ma’m.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Tell me – – is that car parked all right?</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Oh yes. That’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Well, thank you. Eh, officer, you might turn
off the radio. Saves the battery.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Oh, my. We’re too late.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Is he all right?</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: He’s fallen asleep, as usual.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: We’ll come back in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: What is that he’s working on?</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: An ice sculpture. It’s Venus - the Goddess of
Love, the completion of which is his unfulfilled dream.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: It is kind of rough.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: He’s never finished one yet. He has around
him every kind of hand tool known to man, but the poor dear has
difficulty staying awake.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Look, the ice is melting.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: That’s one of the drawbacks of the
medium.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: A little after-dinner liqueur, Harold?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Well, I really don’t drink…</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Oh, it’s all right. It’s organic.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Some nuts? Some licorice? It has no
nutritional value but then consistency is not really a human trait.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: My umbrella? Oh, that’s just a relic. I found
it when I was packing to come to America. It used to be my defense on
picket lines and rallies and political meetings - being dragged off by
police or attacked by thugs of the opposition. A long time ago.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: What were you fighting for?</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Oh, Big Issues. Liberty. Rights. Justice.
Kings died and kingdoms fell. I don’t regret the kingdoms - what sense
in borders and nations and patriotism - but I do miss the kings. When I
was a little girl I was taken to the palace in Vienna, to a garden
party. I can still see the sunshine, the parasols, and the flashing
uniforms of the young officers. I thought then I would marry a soldier.
Later, Frederick would chide me about it. He was so serious. A doctor at
the University. And in the government.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: But, that was all… before…</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: So you don’t use the umbrella any more?</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: No more revolts.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Oh, yes! Every day. But I don’t need a
defense anymore. I embrace! Still fighting for the Big Issues but now in
my small, individual way. Shall we have a song?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Well, I don’t…</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Oh come on. I’ll teach you.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Come on, Harold, join in the chorus.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Oh, that was fun. Let’s play something
together.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: But I don’t play anything.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Don’t play anything! Dear me. Everyone should
be able to make some music. Why, it’s life! - Rhythm and harmony -
That’s the cosmic dance. Come with me.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Here we are. Just the thing.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: That’s right. But be impulsive! Be fanciful!
Let the music flow out of you as freely as though you were talking.
Okay? From the top – Let’s jam!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Okay?</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Superb.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: Harold! Harold! Ah, there you are. I
have a little present for you. A surprise. Come with me.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: There!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: Isn’t that darling? I had them tow off
that black monstrous thing of yours and had them send this around
instead. It’s so much more appropriate for you, don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: One more thing, Harold. I’ve talked on
the phone with your second computer date and she seems a very nice,
quiet girl. Not at all hysterical like the first one. Nevertheless I
want you to be on your best behavior when she comes tomorrow and make
her feel at home. Cute little thing, isn’t it? I like it very much.</p>
<p><strong>glaucus</strong>: Come in. Come in.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Have you seen Harold?</p>
<p><strong>glaucus</strong>: One moment.</p>
<p><strong>glaucus</strong>: Ah, Dame Marjorie. Greetings. As Odysseus
said to Penelope…</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Sorry I’m late.</p>
<p><strong>glaucus</strong>: A rather free translation but nonetheless
correct. Greetings to you too, my little one. Tell me, what do you
see?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: A block of ice.</p>
<p><strong>glaucus</strong>: Exactly! Now, ask me what I see.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: What do you see?</p>
<p><strong>glaucus</strong>: I see the eternal goddess of beauty and
love. I see Aphrodite. The consummate woman.</p>
<p><strong>glaucus</strong>: Each morning I am delivered of a new block
of ice. Each evening my eyes grow weary, my hands hang heavy, and I am
swept down Lethe to slumber - - while my goddess, half-born, drips away
- unseen, unsung, and unknown.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: May we borrow a shovel?</p>
<p><strong>glaucus</strong>: Wait! Let me think. Do I need a shovel
today? No! I need a blowtorch. Take any shovel. You are welcome.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Thank you, Glaucus. We’ll see you later. Come
on, Harold.</p>
<p><strong>glaucus</strong>: Farewell, my friends. “Where’er he moved,
the goddess shone before” - Homer!</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Lady, you were going 70 miles an hour in a
45-mile zone. Could I see your license, please?</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Yes. Those little pieces of paper with your
picture on it?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Oh, I don’t have one.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Come again.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: I don’t have one. I don’t believe in
them.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: How long have you been driving?</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: About forty-five minutes, wouldn’t you say,
Harold? We were hoping to start sooner but, you see, it’s rather hard to
find a truck.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Could I see your registration?</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: I just don’t think we have one, unless it’s
in the glove compartment. Could you look, Harold?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Isn’t this your vehicle?</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: No, no. I just took it.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Took it?</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Yes. You see I have to plant my tree.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Your tree.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Well, it’s not really mine. I dug it up in
front of the courthouse. We’re transplanting it. Letting it breathe, you
know. But, of course, we would like to get it into soil, as soon as
possible.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Lady, let me get this straight.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: All right, then, and we’ll be off. Nice
chatting with you.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I think he’s following us.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Is he? Ah, the police. Always wanting to play
games. Well, here goes.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: He’s stopped.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: The old double U-turn. Gets them every
time.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: There. Oh, I like the feel of soil, don’t
you? And the smell. It’s the earth. “The earth is my body. My head is in
the stars.” Who said that?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: I suppose I did. Well, farewell little tree.
Grow up tall, and change, and fall to replenish the earth. Isn’t it
wonderful, Harold? All around us. Living things.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: I come here as often as I can. It’s
exhilarating. What do you call it? Nature! Life! Soul! God! At any rate,
it’s here, and…</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: … we are part of it.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Okay, lady. Out.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Haven’t we met before?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: None of that, lady.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Oh, well. Must have been your brother.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Out!</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: But there is a family resemblance.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: You too, Buster. Stand over here. Lady, you’re
in a heap of trouble. I have you down here for several violations;
speeding, resisting arrest, driving without a license, driving a stolen
vehicle, possession of a stolen tree… Where’s the tree?</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: We planted it.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Is this your shovel?</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Possession of a stolen shovel.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Officer, I can explain.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Lady, resisting arrest is a serious criminal
offense. Under the state criminal code, section 545, paragraph 10-B…</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Oh, don’t get officious. You’re not yourself
when you’re officious. That’s the curse of a government job.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Lady, is it true you’re driving without a
license?</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Check.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: And that truck - is it registered in your
name?</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Oh no! Not in <u>my</u> name.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Then whose name is it registered in?</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Well, I don’t know. Do you know, Harold?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Where are the papers?</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: I suppose they are in the truck. Are you
going to take a lot of time with this?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Wait here.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Because if you are…</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Lady! Be quiet.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Grab the shovel, Harold.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Stop! Or I’ll shoot!</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Oh! It’s just like the Resistance.</p>
<p><strong>glaucus</strong>: The bitter dregs of Fortune’s cup to drain
- The Iliad… Almost finished… Gotta make it… Going to make it… Liberate
Love… Set her free.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Oh, those motorcycles are awfully chilly.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Yeah. And it is cold in here. Hello,
Glaucus.</p>
<p><strong>glaucus</strong>: Cold… Yes… Yes… Gotta turn up the heat…
Excuse me…</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Here’s your shovel.</p>
<p><strong>glaucus</strong>: What?… Oh yes… Shovel… Create … Verily
these issues lie in the lap of the gods… Iliad… Just sit down for a
minute.</p>
<p><strong>glaucus</strong>: Not giving up… Just for a minute … Then
once more up the hill…</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I <u>think</u> I see it.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Yes. It’s almost there.</p>
<p><strong>glaucus</strong>: Yes… almost done… have a little rest. Not
long… Just a little rest… then once more up the hill…</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I think he’s asleep.</p>
<p><strong>glaucus</strong>: Aha! Morpheus. I’ll…</p>
<p><strong>glaucus</strong>: Gonna make it… Gonna make it… Make it…</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: The ice is melting.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Don’t you think we should turn off the
heat?</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Why? There’ll be a new block of ice in the
morning.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I like Glaucus.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Yes, so do I. But I think he is a little…
old-fashioned. Like a puff, Harold?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Well, I really don’t smoke.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: It’s all right. It’s organic.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I’m sure picking up on vices.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Vice? Virtue? It’s best not to be too moral.
You cheat yourself out of too much life. Aim above morality. As
Confucius says, “Don’t simply be good. Make good things happen.”</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Did Confucius say that?</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Well – - they say he was very wise, so I’m
sure he must have.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: You are the wisest person I know.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Me! When I look around me I know I know
nothing. I remember though, once long ago in Persia, we met a wise man
in the bazaar. He was a professional and used to sell his wisdom to
anyone willing to pay. His specialty for tourists was a maxim engraved
on the head of a pin. “The wisest,” he said, “the truest, the most
instructive words for all men at all times.” Frederick bought one for me
and back at the hotel I peered through a magnifying glass to read the
words - “And this too shall pass away.” Well, the wise man was right -
if you remember that, you can’t help but live life fully.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Yes. I haven’t lived. I’ve died a few
times.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Died! Seventeen times - not counting
maiming. Shot myself in the face once with a popgun and a pellet of
blood.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: How ingenious! Tell me about them.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Well, it’s a question of timing, and the
right equipment, and plenty of patience… You really want to hear about
this?</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Well, the first time it wasn’t even planned.
It was when I was at boarding school and they were getting ready for the
school Centennial Celebration and they put all the fireworks and food
and stuff in this room in the West Wing. Well, on the floor above they
had the Chemistry Lab and I had to stay in and clean it up. So I thought
I’d do a little experimenting. I got all this stuff out and began mixing
it up. It was very scientific. I was measuring the amounts. Well,
suddenly there was this big fizzing sound and this white kind of
porridge stuff began erupting out of the beaker, and moving along the
desk and falling onto the floor. It was making an awful mess. So I got
the hose to try to spray it into the sink. I turned on the water and -
POW! There was this massive explosion. Knocked me down. Blew out the
floor. Boards and brick and flames leaping up. Singed my hair. Smoke
everywhere. I got up, then this sound like bombs going off. It was the
fireworks in the room below. And all this stuff came flying out the
hole. PACHAU! Skyrockets and pinwheels. And fire balls all whizzing and
bouncing. And I was just standing there stunned - I couldn’t believe it
- just watching - being pelted by all these little pellets - turns out
to be the goddamn popcorn spewed up from below. The whole place was a
crazy inferno with the rockets and everything, and I couldn’t get to the
door. But behind me was this old laundry chute, so I hopped in that and
slid down that to the basement. When I got outside I saw that the whole
top of the building was on fire and, of course, it was pandemonium with
people running around and fire alarms ringing. So I decided to go home.
When I get there my mother is having this big party so I creep up the
back stairs to my room. Then there is this ring on the doorbell. It’s
the police. I creep over to the banister to see what they say, and they
tell my mother that I had been killed in a fire at school. Well,
everyone got very quiet.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: People were whispering and looking at my
mother.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Yes. I understand. A lot of people enjoy
being dead. But they are not dead really. They’re just backing away from
life. They’re players - but they sit on the bench. The game goes on
before them. At any moment they can join in. Reach out! Take a chance!
Get hurt maybe. But play as well as you can. Go team, go! Give me an
“L.” Give me an “I.” Give me a “V.” Give me an “E.” LIVE!!!!! Otherwise
you’ll have nothing to talk about in the locker room.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I like you, Maude.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: I like you, Harold. Come, I’ll teach you to
waltz.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: This way, Edith. Harold is out by the
garage. He has a new car and he has been tuning it up. He’s very
mechanical.</p>
<p><strong>edith</strong>: What kind of a car is it?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: It’s a little MG roadster…</p>
<p><strong>edith</strong>: Oh. It looks like a hearse. Very nice.
Compact.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: Edith, I’d like you to meet my son,
Harold. Harold, this is Edith… eh?</p>
<p><strong>edith</strong>: Fern. I’m very pleased to make your
acquaintance.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: Harold, I think you should go and wash
up and meet us in the den. And remember what I said to you. Let’s make
Edith feel at home.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: And what do you do, my dear?</p>
<p><strong>edith</strong>: I’m a file clerk - Harrison Feed and
Grain.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: How interesting.</p>
<p><strong>edith</strong>: Not very.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: Oh. Well, what is it exactly that you
do?</p>
<p><strong>edith</strong>: I’m in charge of all the invoices for the
southwest. We supply, for example, most of the egg farmers in Southern
California. So you can imagine.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: Here’s Harold now. No, don’t get
up.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: Edith was just telling me about her
job.</p>
<p><strong>edith</strong>: I’m a file clerk.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: Yes. Henderson Feed and Grain.</p>
<p><strong>edith</strong>: Harrison. Harrison Feed and Grain… At
Hamilton and Fourth… I’m in charge of the invoices… And I type up the
schedule for the trucking fleet…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: She supplies the whole southwest with
chicken feed.</p>
<p><strong>edith</strong>: Well, not all the southwest. Although we do
have a large business… Barley was very big last week… Fifteen
hundred…</p>
<p><strong>edith</strong>: … bushels.</p>

<p><strong>uncle victor</strong>: I’d put him in the Army, Helen.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Look at that sky. It’s so big.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: It’s so blue.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: And beyond the blue is the blackness of the
cosmos.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Spreckled with uncountable stars. The stars
are shining right now. We just can’t see them. Just another instance of
all that’s going on that is beyond human perception.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Maude, do you pray?</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Pray? No. I communicate.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: With God?</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: With Life.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: This is really nice. Makes me feel like a
kid. I want to do somersaults .</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Well, why don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: No. I’d feel stupid.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Harold, everyone has the right to make an ass
out of themselves. You just can’t let the world judge you too much.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Want to join me in some cartwheels?</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: No. I feel more like - yodeling.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Yodeling?</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: It’s sinking, Harold. Going over the horizon
- where we are all going to go. It’s getting dark. “Let each man hold on
to his candle and get a light where’er he can.”</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Where’s that?</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: From the guys who got the matches, of
course.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Boy! It sure has been a wonderful day. And
you - you are beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Oh, Harold. You make me feel like a
schoolgirl.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Shall I drop by tomorrow? Oh, I have a
luncheon date. With this girl.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I’ve never met her. My mother set it up.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Well, be kind. I’ve lived a long time,
Harold, seen evil as well as good, and it has been my experience that
kindness…</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: … is what the world sorely lacks. Oh,
look!</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Dreyfus once wrote that on Devil’s Island he
would see the most glorious birds. Many years later in Britanny he
realized they had only been sea gulls.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: To me they will always be - glorious
birds.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: Harold, I cannot impress upon you too
strongly the importance of this meeting. She is the last girl. The
Computer Dating Company was reluctant to send anyone in view of what
they’ve heard. Fortunately, I was able to demand they stand by their
original agreement. But kindly remember this is your third and final
chance.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: Here she is, now. Please try to take
this seriously, if not for your sake, at least for hers.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen.</strong>: Harold, I’d like you to meet eh,
Sunshine Dore. Sunshine’s an actress.</p>
<p><strong>sunshine</strong>: I like to think so.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: How do you do?</p>
<p><strong>sunshine</strong>: Can’t complain.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: Well, I’ll leave you two alone for a
moment. I have to call my hairdresser. I’ll bring back some drinks.
Harold, perhaps Starlight would like a cigarette.</p>
<p><strong>sunshine</strong>: Eh, Sunshine.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen.</strong>: Oh, yes, of course.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Would you like a cigarette?</p>
<p><strong>sunshine</strong>: No, thank you. They stain my fingers.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Is Sunshine your real name?</p>
<p><strong>sunshine</strong>: Well, actually, it was the name of my
drama teacher - Louis Sunshine. Perhaps you’ve heard of him. He was such
an influence on the development of my instrument. That means my body -
in theatre talk. Well, when I came to Hollywood I felt the need to
express the emerging me in a new form, so I took on “Sunshine.” Dore is
my real name… Well, Dore, actually. My, what a lovely place you have
here.</p>
<p><strong>sunshine</strong>: Do you play?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: No. I’m learning the banjo. Do you?</p>
<p><strong>sunshine</strong>: Oh, I studied the guitar. I had to give it
up. Gave me calluses on my fingers. As an actress I can’t afford to have
a tarnished instrument.</p>
<p><strong>sunshine</strong>: Oh, is this your father?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: No. My uncle.</p>
<p><strong>sunshine</strong>: Oh, he’s in the Army. I do so like the
military, don’t you? Those uniforms make men look so virile. I did “What
Price Glory?” in summer stock. I played Charmaine - with a French
accent.</p>
<p><strong>sunshine</strong>: Oh, what a wonderful collection of knives.
May I see them?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Certainly.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: This one is particularly interesting. It’s a
hari-kari blade.</p>
<p><strong>sunshine</strong>: Ohhh. What’s hari-kari?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: An ancient Japanese ceremony.</p>
<p><strong>sunshine</strong>: Like a tea ceremony?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: No. Like this.</p>
<p><strong>sunshine</strong>: Oh, that was marvelous, Harold. It had the
ring of truth. Harold… Who did you study with? … Oh, I’m sorry. I don’t
want to break into your private moment. I know how exhausting true
emotion can be. I played Juliet at the Sunshine Playhouse. Louie thought
it was my best performance.</p>
<p><strong>sunshine</strong>: What’s here? A cup, closed in my true
love’s hand? Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end. Oh churl! Drink
all, and left no friendly drop to help me after? I will kiss thy
lips.</p>
<p><strong>sunshine</strong>: Happily some poison yet doth hang on them
- to make me die with a restorative .</p>
<p><strong>sunshine</strong>: Thy lips are warm!</p>
<p><strong>sunshine</strong>: Yea, noise? Then I’ll be brief. Oh happy
dagger!…</p>
<p><strong>sunshine</strong>: … Oh happy dagger! This is thy sheath.</p>
<p><strong>sunshine</strong>: There rest–</p>
<p><strong>sunshine</strong>: - and let me die.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: Harold! That was your <u>last</u>
<u>date</u>!</p>
<p><strong>124 insert closeup uncle victor - same framing as shot
27</strong>: BUT LOOKING STRAIGHT ON</p>
<p><strong>uncle victor</strong>: I’d put him in the Army, Helen.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: In view of your recent actions, Harold,
I find you have left me with no recourse but to listen to the solution
proposed by your uncle. Consequently, I have instructed him to take the
necessary measures for you to be forthwith inducted into the service,
and, for your own good, to take up active duty with the United States
Army.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: I hope they will have more luck with
you than I.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Maude, I must speak to you.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: What is it, Harold?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: They’re going to draft me. In the Army. I’m
going to be sent away.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: But they can’t do that. You haven’t even got
the vote.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: But they have.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Well, don’t go.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Perhaps war is part of the human condition.
But it shouldn’t be encouraged. Bring over that wheelbarrow, will you
please?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: But they’ll put me in jail.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Really. Just put it there, Harold.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: They’d put you in jail, eh? Well,
historically you’d be in very good company. That’s what my husband used
to say when we were in the French Underground dealing with the Gestapo.
Would you like to do a little raking? Work, I’m told, done with no
selfish interest, purifies the mind. You sink your separate self and
become one with the universal self. On the other hand, senseless labor
is a bloody bore and should be scrupulously avoided.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Maude, do you think you can help me?</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: What? With your skill and my experience… I
think we can come up with something.</p>
<p><strong>uncle victor</strong>: Harold, I want you to look at me like
your father in this matter. We’ll spend the day just getting to know
each other. Now, I know that you have no great desire to join the Army.
Hell, I felt the same way myself when I started out. But believe me,
Harold, once you get to know it, you’ll love it. It’s a great life. Look
at me. A chauffeur. Respect. Money in the bank. It has its drawbacks.
Like anything else, I suppose. But the Army takes care of you. You join
up, and you’ve got a buddy for life.</p>
<p><strong>uncle victor</strong>: Good idea of yours to come out here,
Harold. It’s a lovely spot.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Thank you, Uncle.</p>
<p><strong>uncle victor</strong>: Call me “sir,” Harold. First thing you
learn in the Army - an officer deserves your respect.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>uncle victor</strong>: Perfectly lovely. You know, this is
what we’re defending. Everything that’s good and beautiful in the
American way of life. Oh, there’s some nut peace petitioner over there.
Let’s go off this way. Those crazy Commie bastards. I don’t know why we
tolerate ’em. Parasites.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>uncle victor</strong>: Let’s examine the facts on it. I say
this country has been too harsh in its outright condemnation of war. I
say you can point to many material advantages brought about by a crisis
and conflict policy. Hell, World War II gave us the ballpoint pen.
That’s common knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: During wartime the national suicide rate
goes down.</p>
<p><strong>uncle victor</strong>: Is that a fact? Well, that fits in
right along with everything I’ve been saying. War is not all black.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: War is not all black.</p>
<p><strong>uncle victor</strong>: And so I ask you - why the hell did we
give up on the Germans? Those damn politicians in Washington chalked
them up on our side and the wars ever since have been a national
disgrace. Hell, look at history. The two best wars this country has
fought were against the Jerries. Now I say, get the Krauts on the other
side of the fence where they belong, and let’s get back to the kind of
enemy worth killing and the kind of war this whole country can
support.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Jeez, sir. That’s pretty strong stuff.</p>
<p><strong>uncle victor</strong>: Well, Harold, I’ve always been a man
who speaks his mind. It’s hurt me. I’m not liked in Washington. I know
that. But I do have friends in high places.</p>
<p><strong>uncle victor</strong>: They came at me from all sides,
hundreds of ’em. We kept firing - Zat-Tat-Tat-Tat! “Throw the grenades,”
I shouted. “Mac, throw the grenades!” “He’s dead,” Joe said, and kept
right on feeding me bullets. Zat-Tat-Tat-Tat! They kept falling, but
they kept coming. Bullets whizzing all around me. Zot! Joe falls back
with a neat red hole in his head. I thought I was done for. But I kept
firing. Zat-Tat-Tat! Only one thought kept me going. Kill! Kill! For
Mac, and Joe, and the rest of the guys. Kill! - a blinding flash. I wake
up on a stretcher. “Did we hold?” I asked the medic. “Yes, sir,” he
said, and I slipped into unconsciousness.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Jeez! That’s a great story,</p>
<p><strong>uncle victor</strong>: Well, you’ll soon have stories like
that to tell of your own.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: You think so, sir?</p>
<p><strong>uncle victor</strong>: Sure. Be able to tell your children.
Something for them to look up to. Be proud of.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I hope so, sir. Golly I never knew it could
be so exciting.</p>
<p><strong>uncle victor</strong>: It’s the greatest excitement in the
world.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: To pit your own life against another.</p>
<p><strong>uncle victor</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: To kill. The taste of blood in your
mouth.</p>
<p><strong>uncle victor</strong>: The moment of truth.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Another man’s life in your sights.</p>
<p><strong>uncle victor</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: ZAT!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Will they really teach me to shoot?</p>
<p><strong>uncle victor</strong>: Oh, sure. A variety of weapons.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: And to use the bayonet? PACHOIE!</p>
<p><strong>uncle victor</strong>: Oh sure.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: How about hand-to-hand combat?</p>
<p><strong>uncle victor</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: To strangle someone. Choke him. Squeeze out
his life between your hands.</p>
<p><strong>uncle victor</strong>: Eh?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: How about to slit his throat?</p>
<p><strong>uncle victor</strong>: Well, I don’t…</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I’d like that. You could see the blood
squirt out.</p>
<p><strong>uncle victor</strong>: Harold, I think you’re getting carried
away here.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Sir, how about souvenirs?</p>
<p><strong>uncle victor</strong>: Souvenirs?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Of your kill - ears, nose, scalp,
privates.</p>
<p><strong>uncle victor</strong>: Harold!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: What’s the chance of getting one of
these?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Boy, to think I could maybe make my own.</p>
<p><strong>uncle victor</strong>: Harold! That’s <u>disgusting</u>!</p>
<p><strong>maude’s voice</strong>: It certainly is.</p>
<p><strong>uncle victor</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: I am petitioning for peace and I came over
here to speak…</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Parasite!</p>
<p><strong>uncle victor</strong>: Harold!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Crazy parasite! Commie bastard! Get out of
here.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Don’t you talk to me like that, you little
foul mouth degenerate! Really, sir, I thought that you at least…</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Traitor! Benedict Arnold! Remember Nathan
Hale, right, sir?</p>
<p><strong>uncle victor</strong>: Harold, calm down! This is…</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: She’s a Commie pig. We’re going to nail
every last one…</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Don’t you advance on me.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: … of you. You’ll all end up like this.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Filth! Filth!</p>
<p><strong>uncle victor</strong>: Lady, please. Harold…</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Just like this.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Give me that. I’m going to throw it in the
sewer where it belongs.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: She took my head.</p>
<p><strong>uncle victor</strong>: Stay where you are, Harold .</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: She took my head.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Keep away from me, you twisted pervert!</p>
<p><strong>uncle victor</strong>: Lady, please. Give back the head and
let’s have no trouble.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I’ll kill her. I’ll kill her.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I lost my head.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: That wasn’t very scary.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: No. It had nothing on this afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Oh, you weren’t scared.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Scared? Swimming underwater with that oxygen
device of yours. I was petrified.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Come on, you loved it. It was a new
experience.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: How about some candy floss?</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Right on! It wouldn’t be a celebration
without it.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: You sure have a way with people.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Well, they’re my species.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Look at the stars.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Yes. They’re old friends.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Do you think there is any life up there?</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: I don’t know. Perhaps.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Science thinks there isn’t. That we are all
alone in the universe.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: We <u>are</u> alone - you and me and
everybody. But we can look at those stars and maybe someone down the
beach or across the sea in China is looking at them, too. Someone we
don’t know and most likely will never see - that someone is breathing
along with us. And the star- gazers of the past - from peasant to
princes - and the star-gazers of the future - all of us breathing and
looking up there. We are alone - but look at the stars and never feel
lonely.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: You should have been a poet.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Oh, no. But I should have liked to have been
an astronaut. A private astronaut able to just go out and explore. Like
the men who sailed with Magellan, I want to see if we really can fall
off the edge of the world. What a joke it will be if like them I -</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: - end where I began.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Maude.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Oh, a gift.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: “Harold loves Maude.”</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: And Maude loves Harold.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Ohhhhh! This is the nicest present I’ve
received in years.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: So I’ll always know where it is.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Come. Give me your arm. Let’s go see the
fireworks .</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Why are there no photographs in these
frames?</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: I took them out.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: They mocked me. They were representations of
people I dearly loved yet they knew these people were gradually fading
from me, and that in time all I would have left would be vague feelings
- but sharp photographs! So I tossed them out. My memory fades, I know.
But I prefer pictures made by me with feeling, and not by Kodak with
silver nitrate.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I’ll never forget you, Maude. But I would
like a photo of you.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Well, let me see.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: I have something somewhere. Let me see.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Oh, yes. Here. Take this.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: It’s off my American visa.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: It looks like you. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Harold, that picture is almost twenty-five
years old.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: You haven’t changed a bit. I’ll put it in my
wallet.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Oh, you’re not supposed to see that.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: It’s part of a surprise I’m planning for
tomorrow night. It’s going to be really… Maude, you’re crying.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: I was remembering how much this meant to me.
It was after the war… I had nothing… except my life. How different I was
then - and yet how the same.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: You’ve never cried before. I never thought
you would. I thought, despite anything, you could always be happy.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Oh, Harold. You are so young.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: What have they taught you? Yes. I cry. I cry
for you. I cry for this. I cry at beauty - a first snow, a rose, a
sunset.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: I cry when a man tortures his brother… when
he repents and begs forgiveness… when forgiveness is refused… and when
it is granted. To cry is to laugh. To laugh is to cry … a uniquely human
trait. And the main thing in life, my dear Harold, is not to be afraid
to be human.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: Fay, darling, I know Rene will be
furious but if you knew what I’ve had to put up with in the last couple
of days…</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Mother.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: Not now, Harold… You can’t put me down
for Monday?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Mother.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: Harold, please! I’m on the phone.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Mother. I’m going to get married.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: Fay, I’ll call you back. What did you
say?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I’m getting married.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: To whom?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: To a girl. Here.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: I suppose you think this is very funny,
Harold.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: A sunflower?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: You can’t be serious?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: He’s serious.</p>
<p><strong>uncle victor</strong>: Harold, your mother has spoken to me
about your marriage plan, and though normally I have nothing against
marriage, I don’t think this is eh… quite normal. Now, I don’t want to
remind you of the unpleasant incident that occurred the other day. I
think it is best if we consider that forgotten. But I do think that it
would be wisest for you not to leave the house or indulge in any kind of
activity that would be newsworthy. This marriage would attract
attention, and, frankly Harold, I don’t think you need a wife. You need
a <u>nurse</u>.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: There’s no doubt, Harold, this
impending marriage adds another chapter to an already fascinating case.
But let us examine it, and I think you’ll realize there is a simple
Freudian explanation for your romantic attachment to this older woman.
It is known as the Oedipus Complex, a very common neurosis, particularly
in this society, whereby the male child subconsciously wishes to sleep
with his mother.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Now, Harold, the Church has nothing against
the union of the old and the young. Each age has its own beauty. But a
marital union is concerned with the conjugal rights. And the procreation
of children. I would be remiss in my duties if I did not tell you that
the idea of – - intercourse - the fact of your young, firm – – body
commingling with the withered flesh, sagging breasts, and flabby
buttocks - makes me – - want to <u>vomit</u>.</p>
<p><strong>harold.</strong>: But you didn’t ask if I love her.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: Love? Love? What do you <u>know</u>
about her? Where does she come from? Where did you meet her?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: At a funeral.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: Oh… That’s wonderful… I get an
eighty-year-old pallbearer for a daughter-in-law! Be reasonable, Harold!
You’re dealing with your life! What will people say?!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I don’t care what people say.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: You don’t care! “Miss Shroud of 1890
Weds the Boy of a Thousand Deaths!” Listen to me…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: What are you doing, Harold? You can’t
leave me.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I’m going to marry the woman I love.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: Harold!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chasen</strong>: This is insane.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Perhaps it is.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I hope that isn’t too tight. Okay. Here we
go.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Oh, I love surprises! Makes me feel so -
chiffon!</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Oh, Harold, it is dazzling. They are all so…
so beautiful!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: This way, m’lady.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Supper for two.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Oh, you’ve thought of everything. And
champagne.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: It’s all right. It’s organic.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Oh, Harold.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: For you.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: And after dinner, one more surprise….</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: … which I hope will make you very happy.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Oh, I am happy, Harold. Ecstatically happy. I
couldn’t imagine a lovelier farewell.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Farewell?</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Why yes. It’s my eightieth birthday.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: But you’re not going anywhere, are you?</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Oh yes, dear. I took the pills an hour ago. I
should be gone by midnight.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Oh, Harold! What a fuss this is. So
unnecessary.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Maude, please. Don’t die. I couldn’t bear
it. Please, don’t die.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: But, Harold, we begin to die as soon as we
are born. What is so strange about death? It’s no surprise. It’s part of
life. It’s change.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: But why now?</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: I thought eighty was a good round number.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: I feel giddy.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: But Maude, you don’t understand. I love you.
Do you hear me? I’ve never said that to anyone in my life before. You’re
the first. Maude. Please don’t leave me.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Oh, Harold, don’t upset yourself so.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: It’s true. I can’t live without you.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: “And this too shall pass away.”</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Never! Never! I’ll never forget you. I
wanted to marry you. Don’t you understand! I love you. I love you!</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Oh! That’s wonderful, Harold. Go - and love
some more.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Hold on, Maude! Hold on! We’ll be there
soon. Please, just hold on.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Hold on? Hold on? Oh, Harold, how absurd.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Please. There’s been an accident, an
overdose of pills. We’ve got to see a doctor. It’s an emergency.</p>
<p><strong>head nurse</strong>: All right, now go ahead and get the
particulars.</p>
<p><strong>student nurse</strong>: Eh, what’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: It’s not me. It’s her.</p>
<p><strong>head nurse</strong>: It’s better to begin by asking last name
first, then first name, then middle name or initial, if any. It saves
time.</p>
<p><strong>student nurse</strong>: What is your last name?</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Chardin. Dame Marjorie. But you may call me
Maude.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Please! She has got to see a doctor right
away.</p>
<p><strong>head nurse</strong>: Young man, perhaps you ought to wait in
the waiting room.</p>
<p><strong>student nurse</strong>: How old are you?</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Eighty. It’s my birthday.</p>
<p><strong>student nurse</strong>: Oh, many happy returns.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: No. I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: You don’t understand. She’s taken an
overdose of pills two hours ago. She hasn’t got much time.</p>
<p><strong>intern</strong>: Could I have your signature on this? It’s
just a formality.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Delighted! I like your hair so much.</p>
<p><strong>intern</strong>: It’s in case of damage claims, you know, so
we - the hospital - won’t be responsible for…</p>
<p><strong>head nurse</strong>: Always use a ballpoint pen. It’s more
efficient.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Please, don’t you realize? She is dying.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Well, not <u>dying</u>, actually. I’m
changing. You know, like from winter to spring. Of course, it is a big
step to take.</p>
<p><strong>intern</strong>: Not that anything regrettable is going to
happen. It’s just regulations .</p>
<p><strong>head nurse</strong>: Well, then, perhaps you’d better skip
the preliminaries and get to the important section.</p>
<p><strong>student nurse</strong>: All right. Ah, what is your Social
Security number?</p>
<p><strong>intern</strong>: Purely a legal safeguard. Nothing personal,
you understand.</p>
<p><strong>head nurse</strong>: No. Ask about the insurance. The
hospital insurance.</p>
<p><strong>student nurse</strong>: Do you have any insurance? Blue
Cross? Blue Shield?</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Insurance against what?</p>
<p><strong>student nurse</strong>: No insurance.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: This is madness.</p>
<p><strong>head nurse</strong>: I’m sorry but there is always a two-hour
wait for the psychiatrist.</p>
<p><strong>intern</strong>: It’s nothing personal. It’s my job.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: What’s the trouble?</p>
<p><strong>head nurse</strong>: An overdose of drugs .</p>
<p><strong>student nurse</strong>: Do you have a welfare plan at your
place of employment?</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: I’m retired.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Doctor, please. She has taken these pills.
You’ve got to do something .</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: All right. Take her in there.</p>
<p><strong>intern</strong>: It’s nothing personal.</p>
<p><strong>student nurse</strong>: And who’s the next of kin?</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Humanity…</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: Farewell, Harold. It’s been all such fun.</p>
