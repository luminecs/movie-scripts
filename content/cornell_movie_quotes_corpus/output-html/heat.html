<p><strong>hanna</strong>: I’m out of time…</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Falls back on the pillow, disappointed.
It’s as if she’d been stood-up. The bed sheet falls half off of her.

muslin, away from us and exhales.</p>

<p><strong>neil</strong>: Turn it off.</p>
<p><strong>cerrito</strong>: Time.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Their response time?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Two minutes, fifty seconds.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: We ought to be down the chute into the escape
route in 2:20. Here we go…</p>
<p><strong>guard #1</strong>: 211! We’re being taken down!</p>
<p><strong>dispatcher</strong>: Car 74, what’s your ETA to the 211 in
progress Hoover and 14th? Over.</p>
<p><strong>car 74</strong>: Car 74. Three minutes. Over.</p>
<p><strong>dispatcher</strong>: Car 74. Take it. Car 37, you’re back-up.
Car…</p>
<p><strong>towner</strong>: There’s the call. Three minutes.</p>
<p><strong>watch:</strong>: 28, 29, 30, 31, 32…</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Next one blows you up! Out! Now… Now!</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Up against the wall!</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: 8o seconds left. Move it.</p>
<p><strong>waingro</strong>: Flatten - up against it! Higher!</p>
<p><strong>guard two</strong>: …you didn’t have that gun..</p>
<p><strong>waingro</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>cerrito</strong>: That’s true, slick, cause you’re a real
tough guy. But he has the gun. And me, too. So shut the fuck up.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Move out! 38 seconds left!</p>
<p><strong>waingro</strong>: …hadda mouth off? In front of them?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Ten. Nine. Blew the margin. Here we come.</p>
<p><strong>towner</strong>: One on your tail.</p>
<p>****: Here we come.</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: A million, six at 40 cents onna dollar’s 640.
Here’s a hundred forty thou front money. Get you the rest, 2-3 days.</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: What happened out there?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: I don’t want to talk about it.</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: Wait a minute.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: You know who these belong to?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: “Malibu Securities …</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: You know John Van Zant?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: Malibu Securities is a brokerage he controls.
Planned bankruptcies, made out during the S&amp;L’s, money
laundering…</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: You ripped off his Treasury Certificates.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: So what?</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: That’s the point. On top of collecting his
insurance, maybe he wants to buy back his bonds. From him I can get you
60 cents on the dollar instead of 40. Means an extra 320 to you.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Try it on.</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: You know Cezar Kelso?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: By reputation.</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: He’s got this score he’s putting out and wants
you to look at.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: What do I need look at his score for? I got my
own.</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: He said you’ll get near eight figures. Very
clean.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: 9:00a.M. tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: Take it easy.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Where’s the ambulance?</p>
<p><strong>heinz</strong>: They dumped it four blocks from here…</p>
<p><strong>heinz</strong>: Masks, guns, radios - all left behind. No
prints.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: What about the crash, the white towtruck.</p>
<p><strong>heinz</strong>: Hasn’t turned up. Got a witness: janitor next
door.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: I.D. anybody? Plate? Description?</p>
<p><strong>heinz</strong>: Shhaaapes … One big. One thin. He heard
it…</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: What about them?</p>
<p><strong>drucker</strong>: According to the janitor, he… Started
mouthing off to one of the gunmen.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Oh, that was smart.</p>
<p><strong>drucker</strong>: I figure the other went for… … that gun
when the shooting started. One guy called a guard “slick.”</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: “Slick?”</p>
<p><strong>drucker</strong>: Yeah. And they ignored the loose cash.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: ’Cause they had no time, cause they knew our
response time, cause they were on our air.</p>
<p><strong>heinz</strong>: You recognize their m.o.?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Yeah. Their m.o. is that they are good. Once
it escalated into a Murder One beef for all of them after they killed
the first two, they popped guard number three ‘cause it didn’t rake any
difference anymore, so why leave a living witness? Drop of a hat?
They’ll rock and roll. Also: the way they went into the side indicates
they are equipped to go in on the prowl. So also start looking for
recent highline burgularies that have ’mystified’ us. Run the “slick”
bit to the FBI and see what it kicks out.</p>
<p><strong>drucker</strong>: I called it in already.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Split the fences. I’ll take Cuzomano and
Torena. You take the East side. Go through the tapes of who we been
listening to. Hang in with Forensics on all physical evidence. How’d
they know the route of the van and what it was carrying? Does Gage print
the day’s routes? What do they do with the printouts? Who collects their
trash? Run makes on all their middlemanagement. Did someone give this
score up? Check the three guards. See if one of them was a tipster.</p>
<p><strong>bosko</strong>: What’s the vibe: home-grown or
out-of-town?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Out-of-town. Frankly, I hope they are scoring
once and passing through. And I doubt it.</p>
<p><strong>heinz</strong>: This going to stay in Area?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: This look like boosters working the local
Seven Eleven to you? It goes to Major Crime. Go to work.</p>
<p><strong>waingro</strong>: Anybody want some pie?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: This is a partial split, but I took out of
ours - every - to make up… …his full end. Because I want to settle him
up and get rid of this jagoff right now.</p>
<p><strong>cerrito</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Fuck off.</p>
<p><strong>waingro</strong>: I had to dust him!</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Electricity and chemicals a little fucked up?
You a shooter? Speed? What?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: You didn’t have to. Now we got extra heat off
a clean score.</p>
<p><strong>cerrito</strong>: Hold it.</p>
<p><strong>charlene</strong>: Where’s the rest?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>charlene</strong>: Eight thousand dollars? You gotta be
kidding me!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I squared the bookies and we had to pay off
some guy and were short to start ‘cause the rest is comin’, in a coupla
days. So don’t sweat it. We’re late.</p>
<p><strong>charlene</strong>: Listen to me. “As The World Turns” can get
interrupted with a news flash of you splattered all over the street
…</p>
<p><strong>charlene</strong>: I can get sent up on an accessory beef.
Your son, Dominick, winds up in a home. For $8,000? Honey, for $8,000,
it ain’t worth the risk. Risk versus reward? Baby?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Don’t worry about money. Neil’s got… Hey, if
we’re goin’, let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>charlene</strong>: Where’s the club you were going to
open?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Here comes the “showgirl with a future”
bit.</p>
<p><strong>charlej</strong>: Shut up! I left for a good thing. Why am I
even talking to you? I can’t talk to you. All you are is a child growin’
older…</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: The hell’s that mean?</p>
<p><strong>charlene</strong>: It means we’re not making forward progress
like real adults and you won’t listen.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I told you: me and Neil got planned …</p>
<p><strong>charlene</strong>: “Me and Neil.” I’m married to you, now.
This isn’t the fucking joint.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Don’t mouth off to me!</p>
<p><strong>charlene</strong>: I want out of here!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Well there’s the fucking door! Only leave
Dominick, the bank book and the car keys on the kitchen table!</p>
<p><strong>charlene</strong>: You can keep that other crap! But Dominick
goes with me.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I’ll find ya and kill you, you bitch,
wherever you are - you ever try to take Dominick away from me.</p>
<p><strong>anita</strong>: Daddy, daddy!</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Hungry?</p>
<p><strong>cerrito</strong>: Starving.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>cerrito</strong>: Put this away.</p>
<p><strong>anita</strong>: Daddy, what’s in the box?</p>
<p><strong>cerrito</strong>: What do you care?</p>
<p><strong>cerrito</strong>: Open it up.</p>
<p><strong>eady</strong>: Help you with something?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: No thanks.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: You closing in a few minutes?</p>
<p><strong>eady</strong>: Yeah. Excuse me. You interested in metals?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: No. It’s the color reproduction of these
plates…</p>
<p><strong>eady</strong>: We have a first edition of Kandinsky’s Theory
of Color with hand pulled lithographic prints bound in. Would you like
see it?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>eady</strong>: I see you in here before.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: You’re open late. Not many open this late.
What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>eady</strong>: Eady. Eady Tse. What’s yours?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Bukowski. Neil Bukowski.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Bobby, it’s me.</p>
<p><strong>casals</strong>: Boss, whoever’s fencing the Bearer Bonds is
either highline or out- of-town. Everyone’s talking about it. No one
knows about it. Schwartz went through the indexes on recent surveillance
tapes? No armored cars. No witnesses on who stole the ambulance.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Albert Torena call me back?</p>
<p><strong>casals</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Where have you been?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Work. Harvey show or’d Lauren get stood up
again?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: He didn’t even call her.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: What an asshole. She okay?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: She’s been in her room all day and won’t
talk. So “no,” she’s not okay. And neither am I. If I try to create
something like a mood between us you back away. I made a great dinner
for us. That was four hours ago. At least get yourself a plate…</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: There’s three dead bodies in an alley off
Adams. I’m really sorry the lamb got overcooked.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Looking after her is tired. Very tired. He
doesn’t know why he said what he did. He regrets it. So he turns on his
TV to watch the news and his eyes glaze over.</p>
<p><strong>eady</strong>: What do you do?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Swimming pools. Institutional. Schools, State,
counties. I’m on the sales end.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Let me have another coffee. You like selling
books?</p>
<p><strong>eady</strong>: Yeah. Especially fine art books. I study
them.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Yeah? Like what?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>eady</strong>: There’s a Skira edition of Delacroix charcoal
sketches, I like…</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: What else?</p>
<p><strong>eady</strong>: Asian art work.</p>
<p><strong>eady</strong>: The plates are mezzotints. They evoke a
feeling Japanese painters called “sabi”. They believed there were eight
scenes of transcendental loneliness. They painted them over and over
again. One is a flock of geese hovering over a field. There’s always
mist. It’s painted just as the leader touches down.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: City of lights.</p>
<p><strong>eady</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: I flew over the arctic once at 40,000 feet.
The moonlight was blue on all the snow. It felt like that.</p>
<p><strong>eady</strong>: Do you travel a lot?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>eady</strong>: Are you lonely?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: I’m alone. Not lonely.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: You?</p>
<p><strong>eady</strong>: I get lonely.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: You were supposed to get back to me last
night. So where the fuck were you, Albert?</p>
<p><strong>albert</strong>: I couldn’t break free, man!</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: I oughta violate your ass right now.</p>
<p><strong>albert</strong>: I was all night hitting up Los vatos like
one of those flamenco matador guys. Cuttin’ in real smooth. Generating
leads and shit. I’m a dancer, man!</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: You’re a bust-out speed freak jackin’
metamphetamine again. I’m in a hurry.</p>
<p><strong>albert</strong>: You talk to my brother, Raoul. He meet you
tonight at…</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: No. Right now.</p>
<p><strong>albert</strong>: I implore him, man. But he say “no.” He in
Phoenix. Tonight’s the best I can do for you. The Zebra on Crenshaw.
Eleven o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: You be there, too.</p>
<p><strong>albert</strong>: Mon, I go</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Be there!</p>
<p><strong>cezar</strong>: I picked you out to pitch it to first, but
don’t think you’re the only action in town and I’m giving it away.
’Cause I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>cezar</strong>: A bank. On Thursdays it gets cash deposits
for distribution to other branches. The branches have to buttress their
cash accounts to handle Friday payroll checks from a Toyota and Nissan
plant, a steel mill and two refineries. One day a week, Thursday, the
main branch carries the full whack.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: You want a $100,000 advance, against a full
101. Why?</p>
<p><strong>cezar</strong>: ‘Cause I can get it. ’Cause this is the best
thing I seen in three years. ’Cause a screw-up makes 10 percent of
nothin’ equal nothin’. And ’cause those are the terms and they ain’t
negotiable.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: On the prowl or strong?</p>
<p><strong>cezar</strong>: Strong. Through the front door. During the
day.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: How many guys?</p>
<p><strong>cezar</strong>: Four. Three plus a driver.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: That’s not a $100,000 worth anything. You’re
giving me an address to what’s strictly a cowboy score: “Get the guns
and let’s go!” We smash, grab and boogie while they hit the alarm.</p>
<p><strong>cezar</strong>: Three alarms. And that’s why the price.
’Cause you chop-in through the roof the night before on the prowl and
bypass ’em. I got circuit diagrams, blue prints, the works. So yeah,
they hit the alarms, but nothing gonna happen.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Do I have to kill people?</p>
<p><strong>cezar</strong>: I doubt it. Two men have the two keys to open
the box.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Full architectural, plumbing and electric,
camera placements?</p>
<p><strong>cezar</strong>: All of it.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: What do you estimate?</p>
<p><strong>cezar</strong>: Eight point, one. Eight point, two million
dollars.</p>
<p><strong>cezar</strong>: Where’s Nate?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: He hadda make a call. You’re on. Here’s five
grand earnest money. You get the rest after lunch.</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: Look, Van Zant. Nobody knew the merch was
yours or they would have respected it. Be that as it may: now you get
100% from the insurance company and you’re even, plus you can get the
bonds back for 60 cents onna dollar. You make an additional 40%. Your
operation doesn’t skip a beat, and everybody’s making out.</p>
<p><strong>van zant</strong>: Sure. You got a deal.</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: Good. Cause there’s no percentage in everybody
getting their underwear in a twist over this.</p>

<p><strong>nate</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>van zant</strong>: Nice talking to you… Van Zant hangs up.

<p><strong>raoul</strong>: I’m a good citizen.</p>

see who they move and they sit with and give them the same treatment.

<p><strong>van zant</strong>: Who are these people? Huh?!</p>
<p><strong>kelso</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: You got a clean line?</p>
<p><strong>kelso</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: I got a delay dropping the $50,000.</p>
<p><strong>kelso</strong>: You don’t have a delay. What you don’t have
is a deal. Swing by and collect your envelope sometime. Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Wait a minute, pal-o!!</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: You’re going to wait for me for a week. I’ll
buy a week with the five. It’s above and beyond the fifty and if I wash,
you keep it. You’re going to wait for me ’cause you want me to take it

<p><strong>chris</strong>: I’m going to punch it… What do we do about
Van Zant?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Kill him…after the score.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Kelso?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: We’ll use Nate’s advance off the platinum when
I down the merch to pay Kelso for the bank package.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You okay?</p>

<p><strong>neil</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>eady</strong>: Way you come and go.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: I deal with state officials. County. Weird
hours. A lot of traveling, entertaining.</p>
<p><strong>eady</strong>: You don’t know me at all, Neil…</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: I know enough.</p>
<p><strong>eady</strong>: My father wanted me to marry someone in
Taipei. It was like I was a piece of furniture: “Go be his wife.” After
I left he won’t talk to me. Because I went on my own. I can’t let people
tell roe what to do again. And that trust comes from knowing someone
over time. This is hard between us for me. Because I like you very
much.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: I have to leave. Come away with me. No one
will ever tell you what to do… You’ll never lose yourself with me.</p>
<p><strong>prostitute</strong>: Hey, baby.</p>
<p><strong>waingro</strong>: Showed you a good time? Huh?</p>
<p><strong>prostitute</strong>: Oh, yeah. You fly. You cool.</p>
<p><strong>waingro</strong>: Don’t lie to me. I can always tell when
people lie to me.</p>
<p><strong>prostitute</strong>: I ain’t lyin’! You a hot dog. You a
cowboy. You hung like a horse and this was the monster fuck of my young
life. Now I gotta get my ass streetside.</p>
<p><strong>waingro</strong>: You don’t have a truth-telling style.</p>
<p><strong>prostitute</strong>: The fuck’s wrong with you?</p>
<p><strong>waingro</strong>: You think I’m some john? I’m a stone
killer! I’m a sky-blue bad ass, bitch!</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Once again?</p>
<p><strong>waingro</strong>: Sure, good buddy. Set it up.</p>
<p><strong>waingro</strong>: I’m looking to get into something.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Yeah? Where you been?</p>
<p><strong>waingro</strong>: Chino, Tracy. I’m a cowboy, heavy-hitter.
Billy Ricketts said to come see you.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Go see this guy. This guy always putting
guys on.</p>
<p><strong>waingro</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Get your fucking hand off my arm!</p>
<p><strong>radio announcer</strong>: Hey, hey! …there, old aware ones,

different job.</p>
<p><strong>breedan</strong>: Yeah. That motherfucker ain’t invented the
hard time this gangster can’t handle!. Why you stickin’ with me,
Lillian? Why?</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: ’Cause I’m proud of you. Proud you my
man.</p>
<p><strong>breedan</strong>: Proud of me?</p>
<p><strong>breedan</strong>: What you proud of me for?</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Come on home.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Okay. Captain Jackson wants to know what’s
goin’ on.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Nothing. Clear the air.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: Where’d…they…go?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Fell back to see if the alarm bypasses held.
If they did, they’ll be back. Stay the fuck off the radio!</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Quiet! !</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: …We walk.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I’m 60 seconds away. It’s a rat or
something.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: It is not an animal sound. We are out of
here.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: We need the cash!!</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: We walk!! Now.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: They’re leaving. Why are they leaving?!</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: I can take ’em, now!</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Let ’em go.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: At least we got ’em on a…</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Let em go. We got nothing! Not even a
burglary. They didn’t fucking steal anything yet. Don’t you get it? All
we’ve got’s breaking and entry.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: I’m not letting them walk!</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: The fuck you aren’t! That’s exactly what you
are gonna do. It’s my investigation. And my authority supersedes your
rank! And I am not settling for some chicken shit misdemeanor!</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Back to work.</p>
<p><strong>marciano</strong>: What can I do for you guys? Ignores his
hand and shoves him back into his office chair with an open hand.</p>
<p><strong>marciano</strong>: L.A.P.D. Who the hell you think you’re
pushing around? You got no jurisdiction and I know people here!</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: Who? The fucking Tooth Fairy! So what?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: You go back to Newark on a New Jersey warrant
for smuggling cigarettes up from North Carolina three years ago or you
go to work for us. Cut and dried. That…is…it.</p>
<p><strong>marciano</strong>: Oh, my God…</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Charlene Shiherlis.</p>
<p><strong>marciano</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: “Who?” The stranger you been talkin’ dirty
to on the telephone every day for the last month.</p>
<p><strong>marciano</strong>: You can’t tie me to her!</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Who has to. You’re onna plane to New Jersey,
jagoff.</p>
<p><strong>marciano</strong>: Oh, man… Why did I get mixed up with that
bitch?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: ’Cause she’s got a great ass and you goT your
head all the way up it.</p>
<p><strong>marciano</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: So it’s no big thing. I don’t even want her.
You can have her, after. I want her husband and all his buddies; that’s
all. And you’re gonna help.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: LAPD? The G? What? Where the hell did this
heat come from?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Maybe it’s only the EMA score, not us.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Wake up! Assume they got our phones, our
houses bugged, I beepers on all the cars. We got major problems..
Where’s Cerrito?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Recognize the cook?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: D Block. San Q. Did a nickel on armed
robbery.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Hey, David. How you doing?</p>
<p><strong>breedan</strong>: Hey, Homeboy! All right! How bout you?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Gettin’ by. You okay?</p>
<p><strong>breedan</strong>: Yeah. Temporary. Know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Sure. See you around.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: What took you so long?</p>
<p><strong>cerrito</strong>: My car. Bugs. Two of ’em. Count ’em. One in
the wheel well. Second behind the fire wall. Night of the party? I
dropped Elaine and swung by EMA to check out the junction box…</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Without the platinum how do we buy the bank
score?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: I cash in T-bills to pay-off Kelso. That’s not
our problem.</p>
<p><strong>cerrito</strong>: What the hell happened to Van Zant and our
750?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: With the heat we got, you wanna play World War
Two in the streets with Van Zant?</p>
<p><strong>cerrito</strong>: Van Zant gets a pass?!</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Fuck Van Zant. I got more motivation to whack
him than you do. He is a luxury. Our problem is: jam and take the bank
or split. And I mean right fucking now. Do not go home, pack, nothing.
Thirty seconds from now we are on the road. Gone.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: For me, the bank’s worth the stretch. I say
accept the risk, stay.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Michael?</p>
<p><strong>cerrito</strong>: I roll with you. Whatever…</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Not on this one, Michael. On this one you make
up your own mind.</p>
<p><strong>cerrito</strong>: …you figure this the best thing to do?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: I got some plans. To go away after. So for me,
it’s worth the stretch.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: But, Elaine takes good care of you. You got
plenty put away. T. Bonds; real estate. If I were you, I’d be smart and
cut loose of this.</p>
<p><strong>cerrito</strong>: Hey. To me the action’s half the juice
anyway. I’m in.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: All right. All right.</p>
<p><strong>cerrito</strong>: That the place?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Yeah. You see how the road leads back
around?</p>
<p><strong>cerrito</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: That’s the escape route…</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: This is it.</p>
<p><strong>casals</strong>: I know. Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: What are they taking down out here?</p>
<p><strong>casals</strong>: They were looking at something
southwest…</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: What’s’s that down there?</p>
<p><strong>casals</strong>: An auto parts company. They’re going to
knock over a payroll?</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: The company only pays by check.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Maybe they’re gonna steal the hub caps …</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: A billboard. Oil pumps. What the hell’s goin’
on?</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: That’s what we were trying to figure.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: I got an idea what they’re looking at. You
know what they’re looking at?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Is that guy something; or is that guy
something? I mean, you gotta give this crew credit. They are so fucking
good… Know what he’s looking at?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Us. The L.A.P.D. The Police Department. We
just got made…</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: Worth it?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: There’s enough circuit diagrams and blueprints
here to build the bank. It’s terrific.</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: His name is Hanna; first name, Vincent. I
smeared this sergeant in vice five yards. Hanna’s all over you. He’s a
hot dog. Lieutenant in major Crimes Unit. He’s taken down some heavy
crews. Blew away Frankie Yonder in Chicago and he was a fucking maniac.
Was working Narcotics before that. He’s good, Neil. Dedicated. Divorced
three times. Current wife’s Justine. He’s why the extra heat. Vice
sergeant says Hanna likes you. Thinks you’re some kind of ‘star.’ ‘You
do this sharp, you do that sharp. Look how sharp this guy is to figure
that.’</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: Funny as a heart attack. With this guy and
this much heat, you should pass on the bank.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: I’ve had heat before.</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: That’s not the point.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: This one’s worth the stretch</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: You sure?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: I’m sure. Drop me at the garage.</p>
<p><strong>hugh</strong>: Hear from him yet?</p>
<p><strong>van zant</strong>: Not a thing.</p>
<p><strong>hugh</strong>: Maybe he went away.</p>
<p><strong>van zant</strong>: Yeah. Sure. Not hearing bothers me more…
Where’s this guy?</p>
<p><strong>hugh</strong>: This guy here…we put him on. Turns out he
knows McCauley.</p>
<p><strong>waingro</strong>: Waingro. My name’s Waingro.</p>
<p><strong>van zant</strong>: I been living in this office day and
night. What’s with your friend?</p>
<p><strong>waingro</strong>: I know all about how he thinks. We took
some major scores together. He’s probably busy right now. But he’s real
thorough. He won’t forget you…</p>
<p><strong>van zant</strong>: That’s reassuring.</p>
<p><strong>waingro</strong>: Yeah, I got some moves I could make here,
that could be a big help to you…</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Justine?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Where we going?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Out.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: You know I’m on you. Let’s talk.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Sure. Buy me a cup of coffee.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Seven years in San Quentin. In the hole for
three. McNeil before that.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Was McNeil as tough as they say?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: You looking to become a penologist?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: You looking to go back? I chased some crews,
the guys were lookin’ to fuck up and get busted back.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: You must have worked some dipshit crews.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: I worked all kinds.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: You see me doing thrill-seeker liquor store
holdups with a “Born to Lose” tattoo on my chest?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: No, I do not.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Right. And I…</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: I am never going back.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Then don’t take down scores.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: I do what I do best. I take scores. You do
what you do best trying to stop guys like me.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: You never wanted a normal-type life?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: What the fuck is that? Barbecues and
ballgames?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: That’s part of it.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: That’s nice. That your life?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: No. My wife spends half her time on the
couch. My stepdaughter’s got problems ’cause her real father’s a world
class asshole. And every moment I got, I’m chasing guys like you.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: A man told me once: you want to make moves?
Don’t keep anything in your life you’re not willing to walk out on in 30
seconds flat if you feel the heat around the corner. So if you’re
chasing me and you gotta move when I move, how do you expect to keep a
family?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: What are you, a monk?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: No. I got a woman.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: What do you tell her?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: She thinks I sell swimming pools.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: And if you spot me around the corner. You
gonna walk out on her? Leave her flat? Like that? Not even say
goodbye?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: That’s the discipline.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: What you’re left with is pretty empty.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Yeah? Then maybe you and me, we should both go
do somethin’ else, pal.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: I don’t know how to do anything else.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: …neither do I.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: And I don’t much want to.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Neither do I.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: We’re sitting here like a coupla regular
fellas. You do what you do. I do what I gotta do. What happens if I am
there and I got to put you away? I won’t like it. But, if it’s between
you and some poor bastard whose wife you’re going to make into a widow,
brother, you are gonna go down. ’Cause you don’t</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: have to be there. You coulda gone and been a…
a mailman.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: There’s a flip side to that coin. What if you
got me boxed in and I gotta put you down? ’Cause no matter what, you
will not get in my way. But now that we been face to face, I would not
feel good about that. But I won’t hesitate. Not for one second.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Maybe it’ll happen that way. Or who knows
…</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: …maybe we’ll never see each other again.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Can we have the bill.</p>
<p><strong>drucker</strong>: They dumped us!</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>drucker</strong>: They dumped us.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: I was just with him!</p>
<p><strong>drucker</strong>: With who?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Whattaya mean, “they dumped us”?!</p>
<p><strong>drucker</strong>: Chris slipped his tail. And Chris doesn’t
talk about jobs with Charlene so there’s nothing for Marciano to get
from her.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Cerrito?</p>
<p><strong>casals</strong>: Disappeared. No calls to the house. Not
home.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Locators on their cars?!</p>
<p><strong>casals</strong>: Cerrito dumped his on a UPS van.
Surveillance tailed a UPS van to Oxnard.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: They dumped all our tails?!!</p>
<p><strong>casals</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: I had coffee with McCauley half an hour ago.
What happened?</p>
<p><strong>casals</strong>: Our tail saw you. McCauley pulled into a car
wash. Car came out. He didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Does anybody have Any idea where the fuck
these people are at? ’Cause whatever they are gonna do, they are doing
it right now!</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Got it. it’s eighteen inches in.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Where the hell’s Towner? I wanted to pass by
early. I want to check the slot for the work car.</p>
<p><strong>solenko</strong>: How long those guys been sitting back
there?</p>
<p><strong>cashier</strong>: Hour or so…</p>
<p><strong>solenko</strong>: They think this a hotel?</p>
<p><strong>solenko</strong>: Twenty minutes, then I toss their asses out
of here.</p>
<p><strong>breedan</strong>: You spell me? I didn’t take my break yet
…</p>
<p><strong>solenko</strong>: That spic, Cisco Kid, whatever, didn’t
show. After the lunch rush, haul out the garbage and mop the back. Take
your break later.</p>
<p><strong>cerrito</strong>: Here he is.</p>
<p><strong>towner</strong>: Hey! I’m out! I can’t go.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>towner</strong>: Anna’s got a perforated appendix. We took
her to the hospital.</p>
<p><strong>towner</strong>: They’re operating right now. It’s a mess. I
got to get back there…</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: What the hell I do for a driver?!</p>
<p><strong>towner</strong>: Look, I got her sister there, waiting at the
hospital. I came over ’cause I didn’t want to talk on the phone. I got
to get back. Last thing I’d do is let you down, Neil…</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: What do you call this? Backing me up?</p>
<p><strong>towner</strong>: I waited too long trying to get past today!
So now maybe she got peritonitis. I got to be there…</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: What the fuck do we do now?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Here comes your second chance for a change of
luck…</p>
<p><strong>breedan</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Need a driver. Remember the drill?</p>
<p><strong>breedan</strong>: Yeah. When?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: To-day.</p>
<p><strong>breedan</strong>: You’re on.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Out back in five.</p>
<p><strong>solenko</strong>: Where the fuck you going?</p>
<p><strong>waingro</strong>: They buy it?</p>
<p><strong>towner</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>waingro</strong>: I got to hand it to you, sport. You’re
slick, pal smart how you handled all this. On the ball. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>towner</strong>: Thanks. Where’s Anna?</p>
<p><strong>waingro</strong>: She’s resting. It’s going down anyway? On
schedule?</p>
<p><strong>towner</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>waingro</strong>: Make the call.</p>
<p><strong>towner</strong>: Where’s she?</p>
<p><strong>waingro</strong>: I dunno.</p>
<p><strong>towner</strong>: Know what happens when Neil finds out? To
both of us?</p>
<p><strong>waingro</strong>: I know what’s gonna happen. Nothing’s gonna
happen. ’Cause I got it master minded. I got it jammed. This is solid.
Take it from the kid.</p>
<p><strong>towner</strong>: You hope. What do you mean, you don’t know
where she is?</p>
<p><strong>towner</strong>: Anna?</p>
<p><strong>waingro</strong>: …showing her a good time.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: There’s the slot.</p>
<p><strong>breedan</strong>: Looks right. Come out the door, your angle
takes you into the car. Don’t have to run around the doors. You want
them open?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: No. ’Cause time is not a problem. And I want
nothing to look weird.</p>
<p><strong>breedan</strong>: Po-lice response time?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: There is none.</p>
<p><strong>breedan</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Cause we bypassed all the alarms last night.
For you this whole gig is a slow cruise down Hawthorne…</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Drop us in the slot. Let’s take it down.</p>
<p><strong>dieter</strong>: Hey, Casals. I got this tip phoned in about
this bank. It mean anything to you?</p>
<p><strong>casals</strong>: Vincent! Vincent!</p>
<p><strong>wide</strong>: Hanna comes up, coffee in his hand.</p>
<p><strong>casals</strong>: Commercial Bank! Wilmington! 2:50!</p>
<p><strong>radio announcer</strong>: This is L.A.’s all news, 24-hour,
around the clock coverage of the day’s local, national and international

<p><strong>john</strong>: Hi!</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Hi!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Sure thing!</p>
<p><strong>cerrito</strong>: Say, Frank…?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen! We are holding up this
bank. We want to hurt nobody. You do exactly like we say and you come
away okay. We’re here for the bank’s money, not your money…</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: …you people behind the windows: the salaries
this bank pays aren’t big enough to take risks for, so think of your
take-home pay before you risk your life.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: …don’t forget your money is insured by the
Federal Government. You’re not going to lose a penny. Relax and you’ll
get through this okay.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Any of the ladies feel ill or anybody with
heart trouble wants to sit down, go right ahead.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: The key.</p>
<p><strong>timmons</strong>: What key?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Don’t touch your face. Let it bleed.</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: Too many people. This isn’t how to handle
it Vincent! Fuck this crew! Let ’em go!</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Left flanking fire. street.</p>
<p><strong>cop # 1</strong>: Drop! Drop down!</p>
<p><strong>bosko</strong>: Get the bus out of here..</p>
<p><strong>cerrito</strong>: C’mon! C’mon! C’mon!</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Go!! Go!!</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Get down! Get down</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: This is Hanna! Come in…</p>
<p><strong>cerrito</strong>: C’mere, honey.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Bottom tray.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Blood loss and shock and he’ll have a lot of
pain in the shoulder and back, but I’ll give you quarter-grain phials of
morphine. Subcutaneous injections.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: What’s the bottom line?</p>
<p><strong>dr. bob</strong>: Missed the carotid artery by millimeters.
There is mostly tissue damage. And the collar a bone’s smashed. Can he
rest awhile?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Six, seven hours. What do I owe you?</p>
<p><strong>dr. bob</strong>: It’s got to be twenty thou.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p><strong>dr. bob</strong>: You’re number one with a bullet on the six
o’clock news. It’s at least double the risk. So I’m doubling my
price.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: You’re wrong. It’s four times the risk. ’Cause
something happens to him, I’m coming back for you. And I’m double the
worst trouble you ever had.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: I’ll be back for you.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Charlene? Get her out!</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: First, I got to know if our escape route got
ratted-out along with everything else.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Who…</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Who wasn’t around Towner.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Get out of my way! Michael. Michael.
Michael. Michael!!!</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Say, bartender… ?</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: In a minute, lady.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: You seen that fella I pulled out of here
the other night? Big fella with a beard?</p>
<p><strong>tv announcer</strong>: …dead were Michael T. Cerrito,
Caucasian male and the driver, an unidentified black male in his early
30’s, who died enroute to St. Vincent’s Hospital…</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: What can I get you, ma’am? Lady, you
okay.</p>
<p><strong>marciano</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>charlene</strong>: Harry? If you want me, Come right down and
get me and Dominick out.</p>
<p><strong>marciano</strong>: Sugar. I’ll catch the 8 o’clock and rent a
car. I’ll be there at your place in two hours.</p>
<p><strong>marciano</strong>: Get packed. Okay? I’ll be right there.</p>
<p><strong>plainclothesman</strong>: Let’s get you on that plane.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>towner</strong>: Made me…Anna…?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: She’s dead… So’s Cerrito and Breedan…the guy
who stood in…for you. Who did this…?</p>
<p><strong>towner</strong>: They had Anna.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>towner</strong>: Waingro.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Waingro? On his own?</p>
<p><strong>towner</strong>: Uh-uh. For someone. The other worked
for…said…</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Van Zant?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: You sure?</p>
<p><strong>towner</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: You say anything about our exit? Our out?</p>
<p><strong>towner</strong>: …don’t remember. I…</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: C ’ mon!</p>
<p><strong>towner</strong>: Neil…Neil…I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: The house clean?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: I’ll call the medics.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: …Nate.</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: You on a cellular?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: A brick house on Swallow Drive in Bel Air.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Next: Waingro. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: You got the time…?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: I’ll make time. I need a new “out” laid
on.</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: Do you know it’s blown?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: How can I trust it?</p>
<p><strong>eady</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Things are screwed up. You’re not flying out
after me. We go together.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: You and me got to straighten something up
first. I’ll be by later.</p>
<p><strong>eady</strong>: What’s wrong? Neil?</p>
<p><strong>vkn zant</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Waingro. Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>van zant</strong>: How the hell should I know?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: $165,000.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: That’s a rip-off.</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: You want a good getaway and you’re hot with a
big score in your pocket. You’re a media event. What the fuck do you
expect?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: What do I get for those dollars?</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: You end up in Ireland with good papers and
plastic.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Via what?</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: Lear jet to Vancouver. Then commercial to
Reykjavik; then Dublin.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Reliable?</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: For those bucks? 100 per cent. I got the
plastic on me. The passports will be on the plane. Who’s the third?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: A girl. With her own papers. What are these
good for?</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: Forty-five to sixty days.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: How soon?</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: Twenty-four hours.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Make it twelve.</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: You’re going for an important ride. If they
say twenty-four for it to be right, then it’s twenty-four!</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: You checked all around?</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: All around. You and I go way back, kiddo, I
bought you the best.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Where’s the pick-up?</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: Santa Monica Airport. They’re a legit
operation. I won’t have details until tomorrow morning.</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Kelso’s share. Ten per cent. $400,000. That’s
less the 50 advance. The other bag was with Cerrito.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: You stick with the Charlene Shiherlis
piece.</p>
<p><strong>farina</strong>: Marciano’s on a plane in here from, Las
Vegas to pick her up. We got a house I set..</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Maybe Chris or Neil will come for her.
Frankly, I doubt it. You work Neil’s transport from here on the
phones.</p>
<p><strong>drucker</strong>: McCauley’s gotta be gone. He hadda have a
getaway planned.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: And now he’s gotta get a new one! Would you
trust it after this afternoon? Someone, somewhere’s agenting it for him.
That’s a main track. We got Shiherlis setting up. That’s a main track. I
want more.</p>
<p><strong>farina</strong>: How much time we got?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Eight, ten, twelve hours. For him to set up a
new out. After that? He’s gone. Bam! Bye- bye.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: He’s the burglary cop with the “terrific
tip?”</p>
<p><strong>bosko</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>dieter</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Hanna. Where’d it come from?</p>
<p><strong>dieter</strong>: I got my informants. Just like you got…</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: I got Schwartz. Dead. Casals got no liver.
He’s dying. Don’t come on to me with “confidential source” crap!</p>
<p><strong>dieter</strong>: Hugh. Hugh Benny. He gives me tips…!</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Who ratted-out McCauley? C’mon! Who? You?</p>
<p><strong>charlene</strong>: Whose side are you on?</p>
<p><strong>marciano</strong>: I’m on yours.</p>
<p><strong>charlene</strong>: You slimy piece of shit. What a joke.</p>
<p><strong>marciano</strong>: You told me you want out from under?
You’re scared to death of Neil. You wanted out? This is out!</p>
<p><strong>charlene</strong>: What’s your end?</p>
<p><strong>marciano</strong>: You dump broad! How’d I get into this?</p>
<p><strong>farina</strong>: Hey, hey! Go easy on the lady!</p>
<p><strong>marciano</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>farina</strong>: You heard me. She had a rough ride. Go mix
her a drink. Cabinet above the sink.</p>
<p><strong>marciano</strong>: Fuck her.</p>
<p><strong>farina</strong>: Get the fuck in there!</p>
<p><strong>farina</strong>: He’s right. And you know it. You think you’d
be betraying Chris?</p>
<p><strong>charlene</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>farina</strong>: Well, you’re right. You would be. But if you
don’t betray Chris, you betray Dominick. Because he becomes an orphan
when you go to prison as an accessory ’cause you got no living parents
to take him. Then he ends up state-raised and fucked for life. Your son
Dominick’s innocent. He didn’t choose a life like that. Chris did.</p>
<p><strong>farina</strong>: Give up Chris. You get off clean. Do it for
your kid.</p>
<p><strong>farina</strong>: Vincent. It’s me. We’re set here. She’ll
make the call.</p>
<p><strong>charlene</strong>: I’m going to give you an address of where
I’m staying. Could you get it to Chris?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: It’s me. Tracks back to this union guy, Van
Zant. He had some beef with Neil. Neil already settled it. Van Zant got
dead earlier tonight. Now Hugh Benny has reformed his wayward life and
become a born- again good citizen. So, he’s revealed the key player is
this cowboy Waingro. Used to be part of Neil’s crew. Waingro committed a
double murder today on Towner, a driver, and his old lady. Meanwhile
Waingro’s checked into the Airport Hyatt House under “Jamieson.” Maybe
Neil will make a move on him, but not likely. Get the word to
bailbondsmen, bookies, snitches in County, etc. where Waingro is. And
get a team down there to set it up.</p>
<p><strong>drucker</strong>: Want me to do it?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: No. You stay on who’s agenting Neil’s
getaway. What have you got?</p>
<p><strong>drucker</strong>: Nothing yet.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: He’s here. He’s still here. I can feel
it.</p>
<p><strong>berryman</strong>: For how long?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Eight, ten hours max.</p>
<p><strong>eady</strong>: What did you do? Was that you?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: It’s what I don’t do. I don’t sell swimming
pools. It would have been okay. You would have flown out after. You
didn’t need to do a thing. Now I’m jammed. We got to go together.
Because we get dropped in a place and then I decide: New Zealand or
Brazil or Tunisia, whatever. I can’t leave a string back here to where I
am.</p>
<p><strong>eady</strong>: What.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: I rob and steal for a living. Do you
understand?</p>
<p><strong>eady</strong>: You killed people?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: If they got in the way. Yes. It’s their
problem.</p>
<p><strong>eady</strong>: The woman on the grass…where her husband got
shot..</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Elaine Cerrito. Michael Cerrito’s wife.
Michael was my friend. He knew the risks. He didn’t have to be there. He
coulda been a…been a mailman.</p>
<p><strong>eady</strong>: I don’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Believe it.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Eady. Get packed. Get dressed. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Eady! !</p>
<p><strong>eady</strong>: Why you do this to me! What I do to you?!</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Use these credit cards. They say “Mr. and
Mrs.” I reserved the car. Buy me some clothes. Here’s a list. I can’t go
home for my stuff. Can you do it?</p>
<p><strong>eady</strong>: When’s it over?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Twenty-two hours. Then we fly out of
here…clean.</p>
<p><strong>eady</strong>: I want you to let me go. When will you let me
go?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: You can go now. There’s the door, you want
out…</p>
<p><strong>eady</strong>: No, I have to do what you say. But will you
let me leave after?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: It will be different…</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: It’s ready…</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Oh. Meet Vincent.</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: Excuse me. You didn’t tell me you were…</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: Oh, my God…</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: I should….Ralph…I’m…</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: I’m Vincent Hanna.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Don’t you even get angry?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: I’m angry. Ralph, you can ball my wife. You
can lounge around her $1.7 million condominium on her sofa. You can do
all those things. But you do not get to watch my fucking TV…!</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: I’ve never screwed around. I’ve been true
blue to you since the day we met.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: It would have been preferable if you had!
You made me do this!</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Right I had Ralph fuck you ’cause it makes me
feel so good.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Put down the television. You look
ridiculous. Dr. Prince says I’m trying to get your attention. Christ! I
have to pay someone to figure out my life with you.</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: Maybe I should…</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Why’s it my job to figure it all out and
explain it to you?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: ’Cause you’re the one who spends all the time
on the couch.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: And what do you do?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: What do I do? I speak the English language.
Words. Sentences even.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: How admirable: proletarian candor.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Except you don’t say a damned thing. You
neglect me. You don’t call. I can worry about you or not. So I withdraw.
You don’t notice. You’re walking through our life chloroformed, Vincent.
Wake up. It’s almost over.</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: I got Cerrito’s share deposited in the
Delaware Trust for Elaine. She’s pretty bad… Passports. Traveler’s
checks. Plastic. Hangar 17. Plane call letters are 1011 Sierra. Touches
down, holds for five minutes and splits. The plane will stand an FAA
check. Filed flight plan. The works.</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: Here’s the address Charlene said she was at.
But I don’t have documents for her.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I’m not flying. I’m drivin’.</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: Fly. Send for her later. Can’t you talk to
him?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: I been trying.</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: Talk to you in three hours in case there’s
changes.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Use the Camaro. Its clean and will stand a DMV
check.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: How you getting around?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Someone’s picking me up.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: A girl on the side?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: See you, cowboy.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: So long, brother.</p>
<p><strong>eady</strong>: Clothes are in the trunk.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Any trouble?</p>
<p><strong>eady</strong>: No. When’s it over?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Six hours. 8 p.m.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: I’ll buy you lunch. Everything’s smooth. We’re
going to fly away…</p>
<p><strong>farina</strong>: Not a thing. What about you?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Someone’s agenting Neil’s stuff?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Who? The Tooth Fairy? Talk to you later.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: …how did Charlene get the Marina address
passed to Chris?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: I don’t believe I didn’t think of this.
Farina?</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Hi ya.</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Yeah, Breedan’s end?</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: Still can’t find nobody. It’s in the Delaware
Trust. You tell me later what to do. And about your ride. No changes.
Right on schedule.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Okay…</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: By the by: I heard your pal is checked into
the Airport Hyatt under “Jamieson”…if you still care…</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: I figured you wouldn’t waste the time.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: You figured right. Take it easy, old man.</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: You take it easy. Be careful, huh?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: That was the last bridge.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: He blows out of here, you’ll do his time. I
want…</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: Screw what you want. Who the fuck are you?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Your worst nightmare. Hard time, Nate!</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: I ain’t looking at shit, and you know it! So
don’t con me.</p>
<p><strong>bosko</strong>: I’ll work him…</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: Go ahead!</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Don’t touch him! Accessory. Armed robbery and
murder one. Dealing stolen merchandise and securities. You agent for
Neil. At least the armored car and bank. Everything I tie him into, I
tie you into. Two cops dead. Other bodies on the sidewalk. You
understand that kind of heat? You fucking get it!</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: Neil who…?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Book him on Accessory to Armed Robbery,
Murder One, A.D.W., and Trafficking Stolen Merchandise. The Nazi’s in
Quentin will turn your ass into a satchel. You’re an old man. Gimme
Neil!</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: What I’ll give you is so many false arrest
lawsuits, you won’t have time to write traffic tickets!</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Get me Farina.</p>
<p><strong>drucker</strong>: Can we put Nate away?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: With a staff of five or six marshaling
physical evidence for six months after two years’ worth of
continuances…maybe he’ll do 18 months. Won’t fucking happen. Check the
bait.</p>
<p><strong>bosko</strong>: Waingro?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Yeah. At the hotel.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Look over there.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: I don’t even know how to think like this…cause
this has happened to me late in my life. But I got some expectations.
For us. You can walk right now if you want. Walk away. Or you…on your
own…you choose to come with me. I got enough in there to take care of us
for forever.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Eady.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Eady?</p>

<p><strong>marciano</strong>: Do it!</p>
<p><strong>farina</strong>: Shut up!!</p>
<p><strong>farina</strong>: One second at the window. Then it’s all
over…</p>
<p><strong>charlene</strong>: looks at Farina. She slowly crosses to the
window. Marciano has faded to the back of the room.</p>
<p><strong>charlene</strong>: For Christ’s sake…that’s not even him.
That’s not Chris.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Any of you guys know anything for rent around
here?</p>

<p><strong>hanna</strong>: What’s the score?</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk/cop</strong>: On this Waingro?</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk/cop</strong>: I just told Bosko. Zero. Nothing’s

<p><strong>painter two</strong>: We going to finish this game or
what?</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Hyatt House.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Hi. It’s the kitchen again. A… “Jamieson”
ordered a BLT and they got his room number screwed up.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: They’re always doing that.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Thanks, love.</p>
<p><strong>widen</strong>: it’s her hand. It spasms. She grabs onto the
steering wheel to make it stop.</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: A fire has been reported. Please leave your
rooms now. Proceed down marked fire exits. Use the staircases. Do not
use the elevators. This is NOT a drill. A fire…etc.</p>

floor.</p>
<p><strong>waingro</strong>: I can’t leave.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Sir, I’m afraid you’ll have to.</p>

<p><strong>hanna</strong>: What’s the situation?</p>
<p><strong>casals</strong>: Three teams are moving up the other three
stairwells to the 14th floor. Elevators are out of commission because of

seem surprised.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: It means he knew we were here and came
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>casals</strong>: I got two Special Weapons Teams deployed at
