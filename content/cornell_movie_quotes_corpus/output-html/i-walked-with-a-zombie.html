<h1 id="i-walked-with-a-zombie">i-walked-with-a-zombie</h1>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I walked with a zombie. It does seem an odd
thing to say. Had anyone said that to me a year ago, I’m not at all sure
I would have known what a Zombie was. I might have had some notion –
that they were strange and frightening, and perhaps a little funny. But
I have walked with a Zombie</p>
<p><strong>betsy’s voice</strong>: It all began in such an ordinary way
–</p>
<p><strong>betsy’s voice</strong>: I’d just finished working on a case
in Ottawa…a little boy who’d broken both legs. It was one of those cases
with traction frames and constant care, nicely complicate with a pair of
hysterical parents. When he was all well I had to find another job.
That’s a nurse’s life for you. I went to the Registry.</p>
<p><strong>betsy’s voice</strong>: They gave me an address in the
business district. I went there.</p>
<p><strong>wilkens</strong>: You’re single?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>wilkens</strong>: Where were you trained?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: At the Memorial Hospital – here in
Ottawa.</p>
<p><strong>wilkens</strong>: This last question’s a little irregular,
Miss Connell. I don’t quite know how to put it.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: They didn’t teach it at Memorial Hospital. I
had my suspicions, though, about the Directress of Training.</p>
<p><strong>wilkens</strong>: Very well. That means that you have met all
Mr. Holland’s requirements. Now, as to salary – it’s quite good – two
hundred dollars a month.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: That is good. But I’d like to know more about
the case.</p>
<p><strong>wilkens</strong>: I’m afraid I’m not able to tell you much.
Only that the patient is a young woman – the wife of a Mr. Paul Holland
with whom we do considerable business.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: That will mean another interview, won’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>wilkens</strong>: No, this is quite final. You see,
Mr. Holland is a sugar planter. He lives in St. Sebastian Island in the
West Indies.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: The West Indies?</p>
<p><strong>wilkens</strong>: A year’s contract – a trip with all
expenses paid – that’s not so bad, you know.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: But it’s so far away…</p>
<p><strong>wilkens</strong>: That’s rather nice, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Palm trees –</p>
<p><strong>betsy’s voice</strong>: Boats grow smaller to reach out-of
the-way ports. Judging by the boats that took me to St. Sebastian – it’s
far away and hard to get to. First, there was the great liner to Havana
– then a smaller steamer to Port au Prince – a freighter to Gonave – and
from Gonave, one of the little island trading schooners that carry sugar
and sisal, sponges and salt all over the Caribbean.</p>
<p><strong>betsy’s voice</strong>: The man for whom I’d come to work –
Mr. Holland – boarded the schooner at Gonave. He was pointed out to me,
and he must have known who I was – yet he never spoke to me. He seemed
quiet and aloof. Sometimes I wondered how we’d get on – but there wasn’t
really time for to think about it – there was so much to see. I loved
the trip.</p>
<p><strong>betsy’s voice</strong>: I smelled the spicy smells coming
from the islands – I looked at those great glowing stars – and I felt
the warm wind on my cheeks and I breathed deep and every bit of me
inside myself said, “How beautiful –”</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: It is not beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: You read my thoughts, Mr. Holland.</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: It’s easy enough to read the thoughts of a
newcomer. Everything seems beautiful because you don’t understand. Those
flying fish – they are not leaping for joy. They’re jumping in terror.
Bigger fish want to eat them. That luminous water – it takes its gleam
from millions of tiny dead bodies. It’s the glitter of putrescence.
There’s no beauty here – it’s death and decay.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: You can’t really believe that.</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: Everything good dies here – even the
stars.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: It was strange to have him break in on my
thoughts that way. There was cruelty and hardness in his voice. Yet –
something about him I liked – something clean and honest – but hurt –
badly hurt.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: How much is this?</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: You’re beginning to learn.</p>
<p><strong>coachman</strong>: Times gone, Fort Holland was a fort…now,
no longer. The Holland’s are a most old family, miss. They brought the
colored people to the island– the colored folks and Ti-Misery.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Ti-Misery? What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>coachman</strong>: A man, miss – an old man who lives in the
garden at Fort Holland - with arrows stuck in him and a sorrowful,
weeping look on his black face.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Alive?</p>
<p><strong>coachman</strong>: No, miss. He’s just as he was in the
beginning – on the front part of an enormous boat.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: You mean a figurehead.</p>
<p><strong>coachman</strong>: If you say, miss. And the enormous boat
brought the long-ago Fathers and the long-ago Mothers of us all -
chained down to the deep side floor.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: But they came to a beautiful place, didn’t
they?</p>
<p><strong>coachman</strong>: If you say, miss. If you say.</p>
<p><strong>clement</strong>: Miss Connell – it’s dinner.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Thank you, Clement.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Miss Connell – I’m Wesley Rand. Paul asked me
to introduce myself.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: It seems we are having dinner by ourselves,
Miss Connell. But I may as well introduce everyone to you, anyway. There
– in the master’s chair, sits the master – my half-brother Paul Holland.
But you’ve already met him.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Yes – on the boat.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: And that chair – is the particular property of
Mrs. Rand – mother to both of us and much too good for either of us. Too
wise, in fact, to live under the same roof. She prefers the village
dispensary.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Is she a doctor?</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: No – she just runs the place. She’s everything
else – amazing woman, mother. You’ll like her.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I like her already.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: And that – is my chair. And this – is Miss
Connell – who is beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Thank you. But who sits there?</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: My brother’s wife.</p>
<p><strong>betsy’s voice</strong>: We had a lovely dinner. Somehow as we
sat there, I couldn’t help thinking of all the stories I had read in the
magazines, stories in which people had dinner on a terrace with
moonlight flooding a tropical garden. It seemed a little unreal. – Then
we had coffee.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: – But, you’re an American?</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: I went to school in Buffalo. Paul went to
school in England.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I wondered about your different accents. I’m
still wondering about your names – Rand and Holland.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: We’re half-brothers. Paul is mother’s first
child. When his father died, she married my father. Dr. Rand, the
missionary. And you know what they say about missionaries’ children.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: The jungle drums – mysterious - eerie.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: As a matter of fact, it means the sugar syrup
is ready to be poured off. You’ll have to excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Of course. It’s been nice of you to spend
this much time with me.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Don’t worry. I wasn’t missed. The only
important man here is the owner.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Mr. Holland?</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Yes, the redoubtable Paul. He has the
plantation, and I, as you must have noticed, have all the charm.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I don’t know. He spoke to me last night on
the boat. I liked him very much.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Ah, yes, our Paul, strong and silent and very
sad – quite the Byronic character. Perhaps I ought to cultivate it.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Perhaps you ought to get on to the mill.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: It’ll wait.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: I was just going to the mill. Good night, Miss
Connell.</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: Have the servants made you comfortable?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Yes, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: It seems very nice, Clement. I’ll take it
to Mrs. Holland.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Can’t I take it for you?</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: No, thank you. Tomorrow’s time enough for
you to begin work.</p>
<p><strong>holland’s voice</strong>: Jessica.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Mrs. Holland! Mrs. Holland!</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Mrs. Holland?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Mrs. Holland?</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: Jessica!</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: Take Mrs. Holland to her room.</p>
<p><strong>alma</strong>: Come, Miss Jessica, come with Alma.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I heard someone crying – a woman –</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: A woman crying? No one’s been crying
here.</p>
<p><strong>clement</strong>: Mr. Paul – yes, there was crying tonight.
It was Alma. Her sister was brought a’birthing.</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: Thank you, Clement.</p>
<p><strong>alma</strong>: Clement…</p>
<p><strong>clement</strong>: Don’t you go crying anymore – that’s what
frightened Miss Betsy.</p>
<p><strong>alma</strong>: Well, she didn’t soothe me any – hollering
around in the tower!</p>
<p><strong>clement</strong>: Shhh!</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Why was the maid crying?</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: I’m not sure I can make you understand. You
know what this is?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: A figure of St. Sebastian.</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: Yes. But it was once the figurehead of a
slave ship. That’s where our people came from – from the misery and pain
of slavery. For generations they found life a burden. That’s why they
still weep when a child is born – and make merry at a burial.</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: I’ve told you, Miss Connell, this is a sad
place.</p>
<p><strong>alma</strong>: Good morning, miss.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Thank you for waking me.</p>
<p><strong>alma</strong>: I didn’t want to frighten you out of your
sleep, Miss. That’s why I touched you farthest from your heart.</p>
<p><strong>alma</strong>: Don’t get up, Miss. I brought your breakfast.
Just like I do for Miss Jessica.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: But I’m Miss Jessica’s nurse, Alma. You don’t
have to do that for me.</p>
<p><strong>alma</strong>: I know, miss. But I like to do it. I like to
tend for Miss Jessica and I want to tend for you. You settle right back,
now, and I’ll mix you your coffee.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Thank you, Alma.</p>
<p><strong>alma</strong>: Miss Jessica used to say this is the only way
for a lady to break her fast – in bed, with a lacy cushion to bank her
head up. If you’d only seen her, Miss Connell. She looked so pretty.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: She must have been beautiful. What happened
to her, Alma?</p>
<p><strong>alma</strong>: She was very sick and then she went mindless,
Miss.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: We’ll see if we can’t make her well, Alma,
you and I.</p>
<p><strong>alma</strong>: I do my best. Every day I dress her just as
beautifully as if she was well. It’s just like dressing a great, big
doll.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>alma</strong>: A puff-up, I call it. But Miss Jessica always
says “brioche.”</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Looks like an awful lot of breakfast – I
don’t know whether I’ll be able to get away with it.</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: I made it clear in my letter to the
company. This is not a position for a frightened girl.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I am not a frightened girl.</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: That’s hard to believe, after what happened
last night.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: If I were as timid as you seem to think,
Mr. Holland, I wouldn’t have gone into the tower in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: And what is so alarming about the tower,
Miss Connell?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Nothing – really. But you must admit it’s an
eerie sort of place – so dark –</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: Surely nurses aren’t afraid of the
dark?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Of course not!</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: A mental case?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I’m sorry…</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: Why should you be? My wife is a mental
case. Please keep that in mind, Miss Connell – particularly when some of
the foolish people of this island start talking to you about
Zombies.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: Come along. I’ll introduce you to
Dr. Maxwell and your patient.</p>
<p><strong>dr. maxwell</strong>: I’m afraid it won’t be easy for me to
explain Mrs. Holland’s illness, Miss Connell. We have our own diseases
here. But, if you’ll sit down –</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Does she suffer?</p>
<p><strong>dr. maxwell</strong>: I don’t know. I prefer to think of her
as a sleepwalker who can never be awakened – feeling nothing, knowing
nothing.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: She can never be cured?</p>
<p><strong>dr. maxwell</strong>: I’ve never heard of a cure.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Is this disease common in the tropics?</p>
<p><strong>dr. maxwell</strong>: Fortunately, not. This is my first
experience with it as a physician. But I have seen half-witted field
hands – whom the other peasants call Zombies. I am sure they suffer from
a similar destruction of spinal nerves as the result of high fever.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Could you give me the details of treatment
and diet?</p>
<p><strong>dr. maxwell</strong>: I prepared these for you last night,
Miss Connell.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>dr. maxwell</strong>: I’ll be by in a day or so, Miss
Connell, and see how you are getting on.</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: You didn’t find your patient so frightening
in the daylight, did you?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Mrs. Holland must have been beautiful —</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: Many people thought her beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: Tell me, Miss Connell. Do you consider
yourself pretty?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I suppose so. Yes.</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: And charming?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I’ve never given it much thought.</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: Don’t. It will save you a great deal of
trouble and other people a great unhappiness.</p>
<p><strong>rand’s voice</strong>: Betsy!</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Where do you think you’re going?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: It’s my day off.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: But what in the world can you do with a day
off in St. Sebastian?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I was just beginning to wonder. Aren’t there
shops, restaurants and things?</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Well – and things – might be a better
description of what you’ll find. I’d better come along and show you the
town.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: But don’t you have to work?</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: By a curious coincidence, it’s my day off,
too.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Bring me another, Ti-Joseph. I have to keep
the lady entertained.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: It must be hard work entertaining me if it
requires six ounces of rum.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: What in the world are you talking about? Six
ounces – ?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Higher mathematics. Two ounces to a drink –
three drinks, six ounces.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: How do you know there’s two ounces in a
drink?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I’m a nurse. I always watch people when they
pour something. I watched Ti-Joseph and it was exactly two ounces.</p>
<p><strong>singer</strong>: <i>There was a family that lived on the isle
Of Saint Sebastian a long, long while The head of the family was a
Holland man And the younger brother, his name was Rand </i></p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Listen, did I tell you that story about the
little mule at the plantation – the little mule and Clement? Let me tell
you. It’s one of the funniest stories –</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Wait. I want to listen.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: That’s carrying free speech a little too far!
I wouldn’t have listened, Wes, if I had realized –</p>
<p><strong>calypso singer</strong>: Mr. Rand?</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>calypso singer</strong>: Just an old song I picked up
somewhere. Don’t know who did make it up.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: All right. All right.</p>
<p><strong>calypso singer</strong>: Some of these singers on this
island, they’d tattle-tale on anybody. Believe me, Mister Rand, I never
would sing that song if I’d known you were with a lady.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Get out of here!</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Don’t let it bother you so, Wes.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Did you hear what he sang?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I wish I hadn’t heard –</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Why? Everybody else knows it. Paul saw to
that. Sometimes I think he planned the whole thing from the beginning –
just to watch me squirm.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: That doesn’t sound like him.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: That’s right – he’s playing the noble husband
for you, isn’t he? That won’t last long.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I’d like to go now, Rand. Would you mind
taking me home?</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: One of these days he’ll start on you, the way
he did on her. “You think life’s beautiful, don’t you, Jessica? You
think you’re beautiful, don’t you, Jessica?” What he could do to that
word “beautiful.” That’s Paul’s great weapon – words. He uses them the
way other men use their fists.</p>
<p><strong>calypso singer</strong>: <i>She saw the brother and she stole
his heart And that’s how the badness and the trouble start Ah woe, ah me
Shame and sorrow for the fam-i-ly</i></p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Wes. Wesley – it’s time we were starting
home.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Please, Wes – we’ve got to get back to Fort
Holland.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. rand</strong>: I think you need some help.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I’m afraid so.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. rand</strong>: Ti-Joseph?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. rand</strong>: Ti-Joseph, get Mr. Rand on to his mule,
please, and start him for home.</p>
<p><strong>ti-joseph</strong>: Yes, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: But he’s in no condition to ride – I don’t
think he can even sit in the saddle.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. rand</strong>: Don’t worry about a sugar planter. Give
him a mule and he’ll ride to his own funeral.</p>
<p><strong>ti-joseph</strong>: Hey, boy! Bring up that mule – that white
mule, boy.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. rand</strong>: I really intended going out to the Fort
and meeting you long before this, Miss Connell. I’m Mrs. Rand – Wesley’s
mother.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Oh, Mrs. Rand –</p>
<p><strong>mrs. rand</strong>: Come, come, don’t tell me how sorry you
are that I should meet you this way. I’m even a little glad that
Wesley’s difficulty brought us together.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Believe me, Mrs. Rand, he doesn’t do this
often. This is the first time I’ve seen him –</p>
<p><strong>mrs. rand</strong>: Nonsense, child! I know Wesley’s been
drinking too much lately. I know a great deal more about what goes on at
Fort Holland than you’d think. I know all about you – that you’re a nice
girl, competent and kind to Jessica. The Fort needs a girl like you. But
now we’ve got to get you back there. I’ll walk you back and stay over
night. It’ll be a nice change for me.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Thank you, Mrs. Rand. I think you’re every
bit as nice as Wes says you are.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. rand</strong>: So – he says I’m nice. He’s a nice boy,
too, Miss Connell, a very nice boy. But I’m worried about his
drinking.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I’d love to.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. rand</strong>: Use your influence with Paul. Ask him to
take that whiskey decanter off the dinner table.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I’ve no influence with Mr. Holland.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. rand</strong>: Try it – you may have more influence than
you think.</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: No. It isn’t a drought, Bayard. The rains
are just a little late, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>bayard</strong>: I’ve seen the drought before, Mr. Holland.
The cane’s too dry – it’s dangerous that way – it’s the drought.</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: Good morning, Miss Connell.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: I heard about your little misadventure
yesterday, Miss Connell. On your first “day off,” too.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Well, I had a good time up to a point.</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: Wesley can be very entertaining.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Yes, he can. But I’ve been wondering – you
know if you could leave the whisky decanter off the table –</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: It’s always stood there, Miss Connell. I
can remember it in my grandfather’s time and my father’s. I’m afraid it
will have to remain.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: But for Wes – it must be a temptation to
him.</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: I’ve no sympathy with people who can’t
resist temptation.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Still, I feel you should remove the decanter.
Wes is not an alcoholic yet, Mr. Holland. But as a nurse I can tell you
that it won’t be long before he is.</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: I’m afraid the decanter will have to stay
where it is. I engaged you, Miss Connell, to take care of my wife, not
my brother.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: You don’t seem very disturbed by it. I’ve
always thought Voodoo was something to be scared of: the drums sounded
in the hills and everybody was frightened.</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: I’m afraid it’s not very frightening. They
have their songs and dances and carry on and finally, as I understand
it, one of the gods comes down and speaks through one of the people.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: For some reason, they always seem to pick a
night like this. This wind even sets me on edge.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Clement.</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: I think from now on, Wes, we’ll try serving
dinner without it.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Oh, I see. The lord of the manor has decided
to abolish one of the tribal customs.</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: Let’s drop it now, Wes. We can talk about
it later if you want.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: But I want to talk now. Why have you decided
to take the whiskey off the table? What’s behind it? What nice, sadistic
little plot is brewing this time, Paul?</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: Let’s not discuss it, Wes.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Let’s not quarrel before the ladies. Let’s be
reserved and gentlemanly. You were so gentlemanly when you drove Jessica
insane – so polite when you made her into that!</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: Miss Connell, I think it would be best if I
had Clement bring the rest of your dinner to your room.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I heard you playing.</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: I often do.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I know what you went through tonight. I kept
thinking of what you said: that all good things died here,
violently.</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: Why did you come in here?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I don’t know. I wanted to help you. And now
that I’m here, I don’t know how.</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: You have helped me. I want you to know I’m
sorry I brought you here. When I thought of a nurse, I thought of
someone hard and impersonal.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I love Fort Holland.</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: What you saw tonight – two brothers at each
other’s throat and a woman driven mad by her own husband? Do you love
that?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: You didn’t drive her mad.</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: Didn’t I? I don’t know. That’s the simple
truth of it. I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: I think it may be best for all of us not to
discuss this again. Thank you – I know you meant to be kind.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I don’t know how their own love is revealed
to other women – maybe in their sweethearts’ arms – I don’t know. To me
it came that night after Paul Holland almost thrust me from the room,
and certainly thrust me from his life. I said to myself, “I love him.”
And even as I said it, I knew he still loved his wife. Then because I
loved him, I felt I had to restore her to him – to make her what she had
been before – to make him happy.</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: All that you say comes down to the same
thing. You are asking me to pass a sentence of life or death on my own
wife.</p>
<p><strong>dr. maxwell</strong>: Insulin shock treatment is an extreme
measure, Mr. Holland. But – as Miss Connell pointed out when she
suggested it – this is an extreme case.</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: You admit that it is terribly dangerous.
Why do you advise it?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I’ve worked with it. I’ve seen cures. It is
at least a hope.</p>
<p><strong>dr. maxwell</strong>: It’s the very danger itself that makes
the cure possible, Mr. Holland. The insulin produces a state of coma, a
stupor. The patient is revived from the coma by a violent overwhelming
nerve shock. That nerve shock can kill – but it can also restore the
damaged mind.</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: I don’t know – I don’t know–</p>
<p><strong>dr. maxwell</strong>: It is a hard decision to make – but
yours is only a technical responsibility…</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: Technical responsibility, real
responsibility – what difference does it make? Jessica lives – or she
dies. That’s what we’re talking about!</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: You are wrong, Mr. Holland.</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: She is alive, Mr. Holland – that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: Don’t take it to heart, Betsy.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I imagined this so differently…</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: I’ve been waiting here for hours, trying to
imagine Jessica well again – wondering what I’d feel. I could see
Jessica as she used to be, I could hear her say in that sweet mocking
voice, “Paul, darling…” The whole thing beginning all over again…</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: And instead, I came – bringing you
nothing.</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: Instead – you come, with sympathy, Betsy,
and a generous heart. Don’t forget that. Don’t call it nothing.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Very sad, very sweet. The noble husband and
the noble nurse comforting each other – because the patient still lives.
I’ve been imagining too, Paul. You didn’t think of that, did you? I saw
Jessica coming across the garden, I heard her voice.</p>
<p><strong>wesley end their conversation. the script picks up in
the</strong>: MIDDLE OF THE NEXT SCENE JUST AFTER ALMA’S SISTER HAS
VISITED WITH HER BABY.</b></p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I suppose not.</p>
<p><strong>alma</strong>: Things so bad, nobody can help – not even
Doctor Maxwell.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Doctors and nurses can only do so much, Alma.
They can’t cure everything.</p>
<p><strong>alma</strong>: Doctors that are people can’t cure
everything.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: What do you mean – “doctors that are
people”?</p>
<p><strong>alma</strong>: There are other doctors…Yes, other
doctors…Better doctors…</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>alma</strong>: At the Houmfort.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: That’s nonsense, Alma.</p>
<p><strong>alma</strong>: They even cure nonsense, Miss Betsy. Mama Rose
was mindless. I was at the Houmfort when the Houngan brought her mind
back.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: You mean Mama Rose was like Mrs. Holland?</p>
<p><strong>alma</strong>: No. She was mindless but not like Miss
Jessica. But the Houngan cured her.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Are you trying to tell me that the Houngan –
the voodoo priest – could cure Mrs. Holland?</p>
<p><strong>alma</strong>: Yes, Miss Betsy. I mean that. The Houngan will
speak to the rada drums and the drums will speak to Shango and
Damballa.</p>
<p><strong>alma</strong>: Better doctors –</p>
<p><strong>mrs. rand</strong>: Ti-Peter, how do you ever expect to get
to Heaven with one foot in the voodoo Houmfort and the other in the
Baptist church?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. rand</strong>: Some of this native nonsense. The Houngan
has his prescription and Dr. Maxwell and I have ours.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: You’ve never said anything about voodoo
before, Mrs. Rand.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. rand</strong>: Haven’t I? I suppose I take it for
granted. It’s just part of everyday life here.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: You don’t believe in it?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. rand</strong>: A missionary’s widow? It isn’t very
likely, is it?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I don’t mean believe, like believing in a
religion. I mean, do you believe it has power? Do you think it could
heal a sick person?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. rand</strong>: Frankly, my dear, I didn’t expect
anything like this from a nice level-headed girl. What are you driving
at?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I heard the servants talking about someone
called Mama Rose. They said she had been “mindless”…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. rand</strong>: Her son drowned. She brooded until her
mind was affected. All the Houngan did was coax her out of it with a
little practical psychology.</p>
<p><strong>jessica leave fort holland and travel across the sugar
cane</strong>: FIELDS TO THE HOUMFORT </b> <u><b>EXT. THE HOUMFORT -
NIGHT </b></u> LONG SHOT. The camera is behind Betsy and Jessica as they
go toward the Houmfort through the sugar cane. We see this voodoo temple
as they go toward it. It is a rickety structure of poles and laths,
roofed over with a thin thatch of sugar cane and straw. It forms a sort
of rude pergola. In the center of this structure is a small, cubicle
hut, made of rough boards but neatly whitewashed. From the rafters of
the main structure hang crude chandeliers of tin which give light to the
ceremonies.</p>
<p><strong>the people</strong>: Put the god in her! Put the god in
her!</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Make him rich, Shango! Make him rich!</p>
<p><strong>worshippers</strong>: Damballa! Damballa! Damballa!
Damballa!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Where are my people? Let them bring me the
rice cakes – let them dance and be happy –</p>
<p><strong>voodoo worshippers</strong>: Damballa! Damballa!</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Damballa – my son don’t take care of
me.</p>
<p><strong>voice of damballa</strong>: Tell him his own little son will
grow big. He, himself, will grow old. The son learns from the father.
One day your son may stand here to complain that his boy does not take
care of him.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Damballa! This woman is sick.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Mrs. Rand.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. rand</strong>: Wait. Don’t draw any conclusions. Let me
explain.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: But, Mrs. Rand –</p>
<p><strong>mrs. rand</strong>: I knew you’d come. And I knew I’d have to
come up here and talk to you. I couldn’t let you go back without any
word. I came to tell you again – Jessica cannot be cured.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: But how did you get here? What are you doing
here?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. rand</strong>: I asked you to let me explain. It’s a
long story. And not an easy one –</p>
<p><strong>mrs. rand</strong>: – and when my husband died I felt
helpless. They disobeyed me – things went from bad to worse. All my
husband’s dreams of good health, good sanitation, good morals for these
sweet and gentle people seemed to die with him. Then, almost
accidentally, I discovered the secret of how to deal with them. There
was a girl with a baby – again and again I begged her to boil the
drinking water. She never would. Then I told her the god, Shango, would
be pleased and kill the evil spirits in the water if she boiled it. She
boiled the water from then on.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: But you didn’t have to come up here.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. rand</strong>: Perhaps not. But I did come here and I
found it was so simple to let the gods speak through me. Once started,
it seemed such an easy way to do good. I should have known there was no
easy way to do good, Betsy.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. rand</strong>: Betsy! Get her away – back to the Fort!
Do as I say – they won’t hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>houngan</strong>: Trouble. Bad trouble. Let her go.</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: Where have you been, Miss Connell?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I wanted to help you.</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: Help me? How?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I took Mrs. Holland to the Houmfort. I
thought they might cure her.</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: You have deliberately endangered
Mrs. Holland’s life. There’s no telling what you may have started with
this insanity. Why did you do it?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I told you.</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: Because you wanted to give my wife back to
me? Why should that mean anything to you?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: You know why. You saw it the other night at
the piano. You turned away from me.</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: What I saw the other night, I didn’t dare
believe, Betsy –</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: You think I love Jessica and want her back.
It is like you to think that – clean, decent thinking.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: She was beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: I hated her.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: There’s no happiness for me anywhere else
–</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: I may prefer it that way.</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: But I assure you, Father Walters, Miss
Connell had no idea of the consequences when she went there.</p>
<p><strong>dr. maxwell</strong>: Paul, we’re not trying to blame Miss
Connell. It isn’t a question of blame. It’s a question of what we are to
do with Jessica. The commissioner is very concerned.</p>
<p><strong>jeffries</strong>: It has become a serious problem. There’s
so much gossip, rumor and agitation about the whole thing.</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: I know. We’ve felt it at the mill. The men
could hardly keep their minds on their work.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Well, Jeffries, why come to us about it? Why
don’t you go up to the Houmfort and put a stop to the drumming and
dancing – that’s what causes all the trouble.</p>
<p><strong>jeffries</strong>: No. You’re quite wrong. Right here’s the
seat of the trouble. Mrs. Holland has become an object of speculation
and religious interest to these people. It’s revived all their old
superstitions – Zombies – and that sort of nonsense.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. rand</strong>: I wouldn’t worry too much, Commissioner.
It’ll pass. We’ve had this sort of thing before.</p>
<p><strong>dr. maxwell</strong>: This is something else. They’re
curious. Curiosity and religious fervor make a strange and explosive
mixture.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. rand</strong>: I’m quite sure nothing will happen,
Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>jeffries</strong>: If I were as sure as you, Mrs. Rand, we
wouldn’t be here. I’ll tell you quite bluntly: for the peace of the
island and possibly for her own safety, we’ve come to ask you to send
Mrs. Holland away to St. Thomas.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: To the asylum?</p>
<p><strong>jeffries</strong>: I believe there’s a kinder name for it,
Wesley. At St. Thomas, it’s called the Institute for Mental Therapy.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: It doesn’t matter what you call it. I can tell
you right now Jessica isn’t going!</p>
<p><strong>dr. maxwell</strong>: Fortunately, Wesley, this isn’t a
matter for your decision.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: You mean to say Paul can send her away – that
he can hand her over to strangers – who’ll shut her up - maybe mistreat
her? He hasn’t that right!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. rand</strong>: Wesley!</p>
<p><strong>dr. maxwell</strong>: I am afraid, Wesley, he has that right.
And I will have to urge him to use it.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: I tell you he hasn’t and he wouldn’t dare use
it if he had.</p>
<p><strong>jeffries</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Because he drove Jessica insane – deliberately
– coldly!</p>
<p><strong>jeffries</strong>: That could be a serious accusation, Rand,
if it weren’t a foolish one.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Foolish? Tell them how foolish it is, Paul –
tell them!</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: My guilt in this matter, if any, Wesley, is
not the subject of this discussion.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: But it is, Paul! Because that’s why you won’t
dare send Jessica away!</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I still can’t believe it Paul – that you
wouldn’t say a word in your own defense.</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: I have no defense. So far as I know – it is
true.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: You can’t believe that. You don’t know what
viciousness it would take to drive a person mad. You’re not vicious or
cruel, Paul.</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: How do you know I’m not? I was cruel to
Jessica. When I got to know her – when I found out how empty and
ungenerous she was, there was something about her – something smooth and
false – that made we want to hurt her.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I can understand that. Everyone feels that
way about someone.</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: No. It’s not just how I felt toward
Jessica. I’ve been cruel to even you.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: You wanted to warn me…</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: The night you came to me in this room – to
comfort me, to help me – I turned you away.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Don’t, Paul – don’t doubt yourself – don’t
make me doubt you.</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: I remember words I said to Jessica - words
mixed like to poison – to hurt her, to madden her.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: That’s past – that’s over and done with…</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: I want you to be safe, Betsy. I want to
know you’re away from this place – home again, where nothing can harm
you – nothing and no one.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: You want that?</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>clement</strong>: Would you like to see the paper, Mrs. Rand?
This is our newest one.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. rand</strong>: Thank you , Clement!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. rand</strong>: You’re just in time. Will you join me in
the Sunday paper?</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: Considering that the paper is three months
old and this isn’t Sunday – no thank you.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I guess I’ll wait until I’m home,
Mrs. Rand.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. rand</strong>: That’s a long wait…</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: I’m afraid not. Betsy’s leaving us,
Mother.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. rand</strong>: Why, Betsy – we can’t lose you. You mean
too much to us here.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: That’s sweet of you, Mrs. Rand.</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: Betsy feels there is nothing she can do for
Jessica…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. rand</strong>: Dr. Maxwell – it’s nice to see you.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Dr. Maxwell has very unpleasant news for
us.</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: An accident at the mill?</p>
<p><strong>dr. maxwell</strong>: No – it’s about Mrs. Holland. A result
of our discussion the other day, I’m afraid.</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: What about her?</p>
<p><strong>dr. maxwell</strong>: In view of all the circumstances, the
commissioner has decided on a legal investigation.</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: Investigation of what?</p>
<p><strong>dr. maxwell</strong>: Of the nature of Mrs. Holland’s
illness. And, of course, the events which led up to it.</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: In other words, I’m on trial.</p>
<p><strong>dr. maxwell</strong>: I did everything I could to forestall
this, Paul. I don’t think there’s any question of your innocence in the
matter. But there’s been too much talk. The thing’s out of hand.</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: Maybe it’s better this way, Mother. I’m
glad you’re going home, Betsy – you’ll be out of the mess.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: But she isn’t. She’s been subpoenaed.</p>
<p><strong>dr. maxwell</strong>: Miss Connell’s testimony will be very
important.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I would have stayed anyway, Dr. Maxwell.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: We’re all in it. There won’t be a shred of
pride or decency left for any of use. Say something, Paul! You’ve always
been good with words. Put some together, now, and tell us that you’re
not responsible – that every damnable bit of it doesn’t rest squarely on
your shoulders!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. rand</strong>: You’re wrong, Wesley. The guilt is mine –
all of it.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Are you going to lie for him, Mother?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. rand</strong>: Betsy, tell them about the Houmfort. Tell
them what you saw there.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Mrs. Rand…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. rand</strong>: You must, Betsy. They’ll have to believe
you.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Mrs. Rand was at the Houmfort that night. But
there’s nothing wrong with that. She’s gone there for years – trying to
take care of those people, to help them.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: I don’t understand…</p>
<p><strong>dr. maxwell</strong>: I think I do. I’ve often talked a
little voodoo to get medicine down a patient’s throat.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. rand</strong>: It’s more than that, Doctor. I’ve entered
into their ceremonies - pretended to be possessed by their gods…</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: That isn’t true. You never understood her.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. rand</strong>: That night, I went to the Houmfort. I
kept seeing Jessica’s face – smiling – smiling because two men hated
each other – because she was beautiful enough to take my family in her
hands and break it apart. The drums seemed to be beating in my head. The
chanting – the lights – everything blurred together. And then I heard a
voice, speaking in a sudden silence. My voice. I was possessed. I said
that the woman at Fort Holland was evil and that the Houngan must maker
her a Zombie.</p>
<p><strong>dr. maxwell</strong>: And what happened then, Mrs. Rand?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. rand</strong>: I hated myself. I kept saying to myself
over and over again that these people had no power; they had no strange
drugs; that there is no such thing as a Zombie.</p>
<p><strong>dr. maxwell</strong>: Ah – that’s where reason took hold.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. rand</strong>: Yes, I said it, and I made myself believe
it. But when I got here, Jessica was already raging with fever.</p>
<p><strong>dr. maxwell</strong>: Two things had happened, Mrs. Rand. One
was that your daughter-in-law had been taken ill with a fever. The other
thing – completely disconnected – was that you had wished her ill,
because she had hurt your sons.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. rand</strong>: But I had no thought of harming her. It
wasn’t I…</p>
<p><strong>dr. maxwell</strong>: You were possessed. That is true –
possessed by your subconscious mind. You were in the Houmfort,
surrounded by their symbols. To them, nothing worse can happen to a
person than to be made into a Zombie. Your subconscious mind used their
own words for evil.</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: Dr. Maxwell is right, Mother.</p>
<p><strong>dr. maxwell</strong>: Emotion tricks all of us, Mrs. Rand.
And you are a woman with a very strong conscience. That conscience has
been tormenting you. The rest is coincidence. There is no such thing as
a Zombie. The dead do not come back to life. Death is final.</p>
<p><strong>rand’s voice</strong>: Jessica!</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Jessica! Jessica!</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: The Houmfort – they’re trying to get her
back there.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Come with me, Jessica.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Paul…Paul…</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: You! What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. rand</strong>: Carre-Four!</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Betsy, can I talk to you a minute?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Of course, Wes.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Does she suffer? Does she know what she
is?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I don’t know. I once asked Dr. Maxwell the
same question. He said he thought she was like a sleepwalker who would
never waken.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: She hated sleep. She used to say it was a
thief – stealing away her life, an hour at a time…</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Not to a nurse. Sleep is a cure.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: She’s dead. The dead ought to be buried.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: But she’s not dead, Wes.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: You know what she is! That’s death – no mind,
no senses – no love, no hate, no feeling – nothing!</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Please, Wes, do as I ask. You must rest, you
must sleep.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: She should have rest. She shouldn’t have to
walk and walk, in that black emptiness. You could set her free. You
could give her rest. You could give her rest.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Don’t think of it, Wes. I couldn’t do
that.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: You could do it. You have drugs – it would be
so quick – a single injection. If you won’t do it for her sake, do it
for Paul.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: No, Wes.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Jessica was never any good for Paul. You will
be, you are. And Mother – seeing Jessica day after day – never able to
escape, never able to forget. Please, Betsy – it’s only merciful.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Her heart beats, Wes. She breathes. That’s
life – I once took an oath to guard life.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: I know. I shouldn’t have asked it.</p>
<p><strong>betsy’s voice</strong>: It was a sad time at Fort Holland.
Mother Rand was completely broken by the tragedy. But she’s a woman of
courage. She’s begun to build up her life again at St. Sebastian – It’s
a good life and a full one. As for Paul and me – it wasn’t a simple
