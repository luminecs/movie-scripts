<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Amtrack 2 64, the San Diegan, from San
Diego, Del Mar…</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: …San Clemente, San Juan Capistrano, and
Irvine is now arriving at Gate Nine.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Amtrack 264 will be departing in fifteen
minutes from Gate Nine for Oxnard, Ventura…</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: …Santa Barbara, Lompoc…</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: …Santa Maria, San Luis Obispo…</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: …and points north.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Look sharp.</p>
<p><strong>ms. jones</strong>: That one.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Nah. Hates his wife.</p>
<p><strong>ms. jones</strong>: I hate rollerblades.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Lynn! Lynn!!</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Lynn, don’t walk ahead of me, OK?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: I’m serious, honey. Don’t get out of my sight,
all right? I want you to stay right by me. Will you do that for me?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Nods solemnly. GENE reaches the platform and
gives out an exaggerated sigh.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: We made it.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: We made it.</p>
<p><strong>ms. jones</strong>: Skate-boarders I don’t mind, even though
they dress like fuckin’ idiots, but when I see some pin-head on
rollerblades, I get the definite urge to grease the grill of my car with
’em.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Keep your eyes peeled.</p>
<p><strong>ms. jones</strong>: What about them?</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Too old.</p>
<p><strong>mr. jones</strong>: Him!</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: If you ever had an idea it would die of
malnutrition. First those blue hairs then some Spic. Leave this to me. I
know people. It’s my job. I’m a people person.</p>
<p><strong>ms. jones</strong>: What the fuck are you looking for?</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: I’m looking for them.</p>
<p><strong>ms. jones</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Right there.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: I gotta make a phone call, Lynn. Do you see a
phone?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Come on, you.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Haven’t you ever seen anybody kiss like
that?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: On TV.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: You never saw your Mom and me kiss like
that?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Hey, it’s OK to talk about her. You can talk
about her all you want. You know that, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: So, come on. You never saw us kiss like
that?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: No way.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: How did you see us kiss?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: That’s it? That little peck of a kiss? Oh,
brother, you missed some kisses.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Ooh, I’m gonna be late. I gotta call.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Look at ’em. He’d do anything for
her.-</p>
<p><strong>ms. jones</strong>: Young love.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Foreigners! Fuck!</p>
<p><strong>ms. jones</strong>: Frogs. They copy our blue jeans and when
we need their help in Kuwait, where the fuck are they?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Hello, is Mr. Conners there? I have an
interview with him at twelve- thirty. Hi, Mr. Conners, this is Gene
Watson. Sorry to call you at the last minute like this but… Hey,
hey!</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Watch that! Lynn, come here!</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Sorry. There’s some crazy kids on skates.
Listen, the train just got in, I’m afraid I’m going to be a few minutes
late.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Great. OK, I’ll get there as soon as I can.
Bye, now.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Ready?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Nods.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Let’ s do it.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Whoops.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Now, see, this is why you should always wear a
helmet and knee pads. You never know when you’re going to fall down and
go boom. Right?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Perfect.</p>
<p><strong>ms. jones</strong>: Perfect.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Could I see some identification, sir?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ms. jones</strong>: I.D. Could we see some?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Uh, sure. What’s, what’s the problem? Will a
driver’s license do?</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: That’ll do just fine.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Is this about those kids? Look, I’m sorry
about that. But they darn near…</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: You’re from Santa Maria, Mr. Watson?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ms. jones</strong>: Where’s that?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Near Lompoc, north. What’s…</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Come with us, sir.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: I’d like to know what…</p>
<p><strong>mr.”smith</strong>: Don’t cause a ruckus, sir.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: You don’t want to cause a ruckus, with
the little girl and all.</p>
<p><strong>ms. jones</strong>: Come with me, honey.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Hey! I’ll take the girl. I’ll take the
girl!</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Don’t worry. She’s good with kids.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: You stole that.</p>
<p><strong>ms. jones</strong>: No, I didn’t. I confiscated it. There’s a
difference.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: What is going on?</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Into the van, Mr. Watson. Front seat.</p>
<p><strong>ms. jones</strong>: Let’s get your seatbelt on. Always gotta
wear your seatbelt, isn’t that right?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: I want my daddy.</p>
<p><strong>ms. jones</strong>: There’s your daddy. See? We’re your
daddy’s friends.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: That’s right. The policeman is your
friend. Isn’t that right, Daddy?</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Daddy?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Yes. It’s OK, Lynn. These are our friends.</p>
<p><strong>ms. jones</strong>: Hey, would you look at this crazy car?
Everybody has their own radio. What do you think of that?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Everybody does?</p>
<p><strong>ms. jones</strong>: Yep. And you can listen to it without
anybody else listening. Let’s try it out.</p>
<p><strong>ms. jones</strong>: This is what they call the jack. Hi,
Jack!</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Laughs.</p>
<p><strong>ms. jones</strong>: It goes in that little hole.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Let me do it.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: It’s loud!</p>
<p><strong>ms jones</strong>: Removes a Pro Label Machine from under the
seat. She begins to type in several characters.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Let’s get down to business.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Who are you? You’re not the police.</p>
<p><strong>ms. jones</strong>: Brilliant.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Pay attention, Mr. Watson. Pay attention
and your daughter won’t be hurt.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: You wouldn’t…</p>
<p><strong>ms. jones</strong>: Try us.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Get your hands off her.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Mr. Watson, you’re not paying attention.
Your daughter’s life depends on you. Do you understand that?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Yes, yes, I understand.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: This is for you. In it there is a picture
of a woman and an itinerary. It is her itinerary. She is presently - are
you listening, Mr. Watson?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Yes, I’m listening.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: She is presently at the Bonaventure
Hotel. That’s right near here.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: When you leave this van you will get
yourself a cab and take it to the Bonaventure Hotel. Then you will take
this.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: …and you will kill the woman whose
picture is in there. Not just shoot her, mind,! kill her. I’d recommend
you empty the gun into her. Close up. Got all that?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: You’re out of your mind.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: What’s your point?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: I will do no such thing.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Yes, you will, Mr. Watson.</p>
<p><strong>ms. jones</strong>: Don’t worry. We’ll take good care of the
kid.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: It is now 12:16. If the woman in the
picture is alive at 1:30… …I call my partner, your daughter is dead.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: And what happens if I don’t call you?</p>
<p><strong>ms. jones</strong>: I kill her anyway.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Did you hear that, Mr. Watson? Do you
understand?</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: The woman in the picture…</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: …or your daughter.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Oh, my God…</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: God can’t help her, Mr. Watson. Only you
can help her.</p>
<p><strong>ms. jones</strong>: Only you.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: You’re wasting time.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Where is my daddy going?</p>
<p><strong>ms. jones</strong>: He’s going to help the police. Your daddy
is going to be a hero.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: My daddy is going to be a hero? Like Power
Rangers?</p>
<p><strong>ms. jones</strong>: Just like Power Rangers.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Let’s test this thing. You on?</p>
<p><strong>ms. jones</strong>: Reading you.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: You’11 need some cash. I’ll hang onto
this for the time being. Oh, and…</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: You’ll need these.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Get moving, Mr. Watson. Time’s a
wastin’.</p>
<p><strong>little girl</strong>: Mama!</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: You talk to a cop, you even look at a cop
too long and your daughter is dead. Do it.</p>
<p><strong>ms. jones</strong>: Go ahead, sugar Die.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Lynn calling Daddy. Lynn calling Daddy. Come
in, Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Lynn!</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: I can hear you good. Can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Yes. Yes, I can hear you.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: That’s enough.</p>
<p><strong>ms. jones</strong>: ’Daddy has to go now.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: He has to say “over and out”. Daddy, you have
to say “over and out”.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Over and out.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Look at your watch. Look at it! At
one-thirty your little girl is dead. Say it with me. At one-thirty my
little girl is dead. Say it. Say it!</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: At one thirty my little girl is dead.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Unless you do what you’re told. Go do
it!</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: And don’t forget I’ll be watching
you.</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: Where to, sir?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: The Bonaventure. The Bonaventure Hotel. Do you
know where that is?</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: Amtrack?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: You just come in on Amtrack?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Uh, yes..</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: Business or pleasure?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Business.</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: Where’d you come from?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: San Diego.</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: Oh, San Diego? I’ve thought about moving to
San Diego. It’s hard to make a living in this town. These short hops.
Can’t make a dime on ’em. To LAX, Pasadena, then I can make a buck.
These little hops cost me money.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: ’S okay. What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: Better in San Diego? More opportunity there?
What?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: I really don’t know. I don’t live there. I was
just visiting…a grave.</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: Aw, too bad.</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: Somebody close?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: The grave. Somebody close?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Wife. Ex-wife. Almost ex. We were separated.
She was thinking about a divorce.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Look…I’ve… I’ve got a problem. A big
problem…</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: Oh, yeah?</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: Jesus! Watch it, buddy!</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: I’d love to hear about your problem, but the
ride’s over. Three-fifty.</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: Three-fifty. I hope your problem doesn’t
have anything to do with my three-fifty.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Right. Right.</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: What do I want with an accountant?</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: I got one for the airport. You free?</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: You bet.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Oh, my God. Oh, no.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Oh, shit.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Oh, sweet Jesus…</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Could you tell me where the Emerald Bay Room
is?</p>
<p><strong>gustino</strong>: Third floor. Yellow stairwell. Follow the
signs.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot.</p>
<p><strong>gustino</strong>: No problem.</p>
<p><strong>brendan grant</strong>: Whoops!</p>
<p><strong>brendan grant</strong>: Nice body check.</p>
<p><strong>brendan grant</strong>: You know my wife has a deeply
personal reason for going after repeat drunk drivers. They are felons
and they should be treated as such. A drivers license is a privilege,
not a right.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Excuse me, is the…thing over?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Yes. You didn’t miss much. The food…chicken
again.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Eleanor Grant is gone?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Yes. Nice speech. But it’s the same at all
these…</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Check your itinerary. Move along.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: This says “invitation only”.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Of course you’re invited. You’re a big
donor to the campaign. They love you.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: This’11 get you in anywhere. Red
Elevator. Thirty-fifth floor.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Where did you get these? Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: I’m the guy who’s going to kill your
daughter if you don’t get moving.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor grant</strong>: They-didn’t hear a word I said. The
mike was too low on the podium.</p>
<p><strong>krista</strong>: How much did we pay for that room?</p>
<p><strong>chief aide</strong>: We didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor grant</strong>: Somebody did.</p>
<p><strong>krist</strong>: A Have Nolin pre-check the PA systems.</p>
<p><strong>bodyguard</strong>: Excuse me, sir, this car is for the
Governor. You can take the next one.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor grant</strong>: Don’t you dare, Franco. This is one
of our biggest supporters.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor grant</strong>: Eleanor Grant, gubernatorial
incumbent. That’s a mouthful isn’t- it? I love saying that.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor grant</strong>: Whose idea was it to have a lunch
right after the brunch? I’m about to bust as it is.</p>
<p><strong>krista</strong>: We’ll just walk through, do a little
grip-and-grin, then get ready for the press con.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Governor…</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: I need your help.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor grant</strong>: What can I do for you Mr….Watson?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Its’…ah…about my daughter….</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Room for one more?</p>
<p><strong>eleanor grant</strong>: I think we can accommodate you.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor grant</strong>: Eleanor Grant, gubernatorial
incumbent.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: A pleasure to meet you, Governor.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor grant</strong>: You were saying? Your daughter….?</p>
<p><strong>eleanor grant</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: She ..ahh…wanted me to… be sure to get your
autograph.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor grant</strong>: Of course. I wish everything were
that easy.</p>
<p><strong>krista</strong>: I’ve got the pen if you’ve got the
paper.</p>
<p><strong>krista</strong>: How about that?</p>
<p><strong>krista</strong>: Is that something precious?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: No, that’s,..that’s fine</p>
<p><strong>eleanor grant</strong>: What’s her name?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Her name? Her name is Lynn.</p>
<p><strong>krista</strong>: It’s funny. I don’t even keep a pad of paper
with me anymore, everything’s gone so electronic.</p>
<p><strong>krista</strong>: If it wasn’t for double A batteries I’d be
in big trouble.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor grant</strong>: Are you all right? Elevators make me
queasy, too.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: She was right in front of you! What’s
wrong with you!?</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Are you ’fucking with me!?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: The gun…</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: What about the gun?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: It wasn’t loaded. I didn’t put the bullets in
it.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: You…</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: You won’t get many chances like that,
Mr. Watson. That’s the way life works. Don’t blow the next one.</p>
<p><strong>ms. jones</strong>: That’s pretty good.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: I’ve done much better ones than this.</p>
<p><strong>ms. jones</strong>: You have, huh?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Oh, yes. I’ll show you. I have much more
colors at home.</p>
<p><strong>ms. jones</strong>: That’s good. That’s good, sweetie
pie.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: There, all loaded. Ready for the
hunt.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Having a rough day? Down at the heels as
they…?</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: You don’t see your face, you don’t pay!</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Having a rough day? Down at the heels as they
say? What you need is a shoe shine, shoe shine, shoe shine today.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Take ten, take a break, take a seat, take a
load off. Put the world in perspective.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: So, are you a visitor or lucky enough to live
in The City of Angels?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: I’m…I’m visiting.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: What do you do, if I may be so bold?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: I’m just an accountant.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Don’t denigrate yourself, my friend. Where
would the government be without accountants? They wouldn’t know how hard
they can squeeze us before we pop, isn’t that right?</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Now you take tips. Time was a tip was between
a man and his customer. Not any more. They’ve figured out what they call
a formulae, don’t laugh, it ain’t for babies. They take your sales, see,
and slap a percentile on there, figuring that somewhere between your
lies and your bad luck they’ll hit on the mean amount, mean meaning “in
the middle”, but if you ask me it means “just plain mean”. Why you can
have Uncle Scrooge wring a nickel over your poor out-stretched palm, or
Daddy Warbucks dropping pearl stick-pins like manna from heaven, don’t
make no difference, they’ll tax your behind according to that same
figure. Doesn’t seem quite right., does it?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: No. No, it doesn’t.</p>
<p><strong>gustino</strong>: Hey, Huey, how’s it hangin’?</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: It’s a load, my friend, but somebody’s got to
carry it.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: I have to do something.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: What’s that? You have to speak up. I’m a
little deaf in this ear. Between that and my wooden leg I’m a mess.
Compliments of the United States Army Artillery Corps.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: I said I have to do something.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: I’ll have you out of here in two shakes o’f a
lamb’s tail.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Is within himself.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Drove me crazy. There must have been one on
me. I didn’t add up so she left. That’s what attracted me to her In the
first place. She made up her mind and she did it. She wouldn’t sit
around waiting for…whatever. She’d do something. She’d do something.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Yes, well, you know, for a quality shoe you
can’t beat a good wingtip. Wears like iron. You’re a wise man. There ya’
go. Two bucks.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: You got anything smaller?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Keep it.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: It’s a twenty.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Keep it.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Well…thanks muchly…</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Can I get out to Flower Street from here?</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Sure. Go down past the bar. Take you right out
there.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: You get another chance in ten
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Then I have time for a drink.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: All right, Mr. Watson, but make it just
one. I don’t want you…</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: So where was I?</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: I don’t know. Something about the
Governor’s new regime.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Oh yeah. She’s dumping the Good Old Boys
like yesterday’s newspapers.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: The white boys are in for it. When they
got her elected they never thought she was gonna make the Governor’s
office look like the United Nations.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: We’re talking Custer’s Last Stand here.
The only minorities not on her staff are the ones still lost in the Rain
Forest.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Lynn!</p>
<p><strong>ms. jones</strong>: Shhh. You’ll wake the baby up.</p>
<p><strong>ms. jones</strong>: What we have here is what they call a
Mexican standoff. The thing you gotta ask yourself is, “What’s behind
the seat?” Now, a twenty-two’d go right through it, but even a button
will throw a twenty-two off so there’s a good chance it’d get screwed up
somewhere along the way, miss the target. Maybe a thirty-eight? A
thirty-eight’11 drill pretty straight, unless it hits metal, then it’ll
bust up in little bitty pieces. They’ll keep going but they’ll be slowed
down quite a bit. How’s about a three-fifty-seven? It’ll go through the
seat, her, you, the dashboard, shit, it’ll go through the engine block
before it knows it’s hit anything, end up in some pedestrian three
blocks away. What do you think? What’s my poison?</p>
<p><strong>ms. jones</strong>: Well it’s a comfort to know you’ve got
the co-Jones to pull that thing out. Whether you’ve got the balls to
pull the trigger we’ve still got to see.</p>
<p><strong>ms. jones</strong>: He’s coming back in.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: I’ve got him in the crosshairs.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Pool Deck?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Fourth Floor. Take that escalator.</p>
<p><strong>brendan grant</strong>: My wife is not interested in negative
campaigning. She wants to accentuate the positive. I don’t know about
you but I find that refreshing.</p>
<p><strong>a reporter</strong>: Have you ever thought of running for
office yourself?</p>
<p><strong>brendan grant</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>brendan grant</strong>: I’m just a business man.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: I know what you’re thinking.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: What would you do in my place?</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: The bitch would be dead. Course I ain’t
sayin’ which bitch.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: There’s a plot to kill the Governor. If you
don’t believe me, check that guy right there. He has a gun.</p>
<p><strong>officer trust</strong>: So do you, Mr. Watson.</p>
<p><strong>officer trust</strong>: You got this under control?</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>officer trust</strong>: It doesn’t look like it.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: It’s under control.</p>
<p><strong>officer trust</strong>: It better be.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: I oughta throw you after that walkie-
talkie but I’m going to give you a break because you’re an amateur.</p>
<p><strong>waiter m</strong>: Gentlemen…</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Yeah, thanks. Have a cracker.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Have a cracker, Mr. Watson.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: There was this guy. Big guy. Irish-
Italian. Red-faced, black-haired, jolly son-of-a-bitch.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Nobody could make me laugh like him. We
closed more bars together than I can count. He was my pal. I loved that
crazy mick, I’m not ashamed to say it. But he was fuck-up. He had this
image of himself. Thought he was con man. Always trying to shave the
edge. Nickel and dime. I’ll always miss him. Tell me why.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: What…?</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Tell me why I miss him.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: He’s dead?</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: That’s right. He’s dead. Tell me why.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: How should I…?</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Tell me why he’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: You killed him.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: That’s right, I killed him. He fucked up
one too many times so I put a bullet in his eye. Then I put two more
into him just to make sure. Now that was somebody I loved.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: I loved that motherfucker but I got the
call and I put him down like a sick animal. So if you’ve got any doubts
about what’s going to happen if you don’t deliver let me tell you
something. I’d make gravy out of your little girl just to season that
black Irish cocksucker’s meat.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Do what you’re supposed to do. Do it
now.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>tom bradley</strong>: It is my extreme pleasure this
afternoon to introduce to you…</p>
<p><strong>tom bradley</strong>: …a woman who can only be characterized
as a one-of-a-kind.</p>
<p><strong>krista</strong>: Feeling better?</p>
<p><strong>tom bradley</strong>: An iconoclast with class…</p>
<p><strong>krista</strong>: The elevator. You weren’t feeling well.</p>
<p><strong>tom bradley</strong>: A genuine lady who’s not afraid to get
into the trenches…</p>
<p><strong>krista</strong>: Are you better now?</p>
<p><strong>tom bradley</strong>: …and go to the mat with greedy special
interests…</p>
<p><strong>tom bradley</strong>: The finest Governor our state has ever
had…</p>
<p><strong>tom bradley</strong>: My friend and yours, Governor Eleanor
Grant!</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: My wife always said I had a problem trusting
people.</p>
<p><strong>krista</strong>: Well, you can trust Eleanor Samara
Grant.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: You don’t understand. I’m going to trust you.
And you have to trust me.</p>
<p><strong>krista</strong>: Yes, you’re right, I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Look…my daughter … she’s going to die…unless
you can help me.</p>
<p><strong>krista</strong>: Sure, sure, I’ll help you. Let me get
Mr. White. I’m sure he can assist you, he’s our…</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: No! You have to listen to me.</p>
<p><strong>krista</strong>: I’m listening, I’m listening.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor grant</strong>: My friends, my good friends…</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Please…please…you have to believe me… They
have my daughter. They want me to kill Eleanor Grant � or they’ll kill
my daughter.</p>
<p><strong>krista</strong>: All right, let’s just…let’s get security in
on this.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: No! You can’t! They’re in on it.</p>
<p><strong>krista</strong>: I don’t see how they could be in on it.
They’re the best. They’re hand- picked.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: I don’t know. One of them is following me. If
he knew what I’d just told you they’d…</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Look, how did I get in here with this!?</p>
<p><strong>krista</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: You’ve got to trust me. I’m putting my
daughter’s life in your hands. She’s only six. She’s just a little girl.
Please, please, trust me.</p>
<p><strong>krista</strong>: It’s a little hard to trust you under the
circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: You’re right, it is. Here.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Will you trust me now?</p>
<p><strong>krista</strong>: I guess I’ll have to. Come on, there’s one
person we can go to.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: The man following me has a walkie- talkie. If
he sees I’m not here he’ll call his partner. I do anything out of line
and he’ll send the word to kill my daughter.</p>
<p><strong>krista</strong>: He’ll think you’re in the crowd until the
end of the speech. Wait a minute.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor grant</strong>: …I remember that horrible night as if
it were yesterday. A phone call pulling me out of sleep, the terrible
news…</p>
<p><strong>eleanor grant</strong>: My husband and child senselessly
killed by a drunk driver.</p>
<p><strong>krista</strong>: We’ve got about ten minutes.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>krista</strong>: I’ve heard this speech a lot. Come on. We’ll
take care of him. We will.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: But…</p>
<p><strong>krista</strong>: Trust me. You asked me for help. Let me
help. Trust me.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Okay…</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: I think you better put that away.</p>
<p><strong>krista</strong>: I think you’re right.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor grant</strong>: But tragedy, if it doesn’t destroy
us, has a curious way of giving us strength.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor grant</strong>: I doubt if I would be before you now,
if I hadn’t been put through that crucible of loss.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor grant</strong>: And though I can never forget William
and Bill Junior or the love I felt for them…</p>
<p><strong>eleanor grant</strong>: I have found joy again in serving
this great state. I have found love again in my second husband
Brendan…</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Where are we going?</p>
<p><strong>hall guard</strong>: Ms. Brooks …</p>
<p><strong>krista</strong>: Is he in?</p>
<p><strong>hall guard</strong>: Yes, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Who is this? Are you sure we can trust
him?</p>
<p><strong>krista</strong>: I’m sure. It’s her husband. He’s her
Campaign Manager.</p>
<p><strong>brendan grant</strong>: What is it? Is there a problem?</p>
<p><strong>krista</strong>: We need to see you, Brendan.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: We have to hurry.</p>
<p><strong>krista</strong>: I know. Brendan, listen to me. Someone is
trying to kill Eleanor.</p>
<p><strong>brendan grant</strong>: What? What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>krista</strong>: We need people we can “trust. We only have a
few moments…</p>
<p><strong>brendan grant</strong>: This is…this is insane. How do you
know this?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: I know it because I’m the one who’s supposed
to kill her.</p>
<p><strong>brendan grant</strong>: You are!? You brought this man here!?
You brought this man to my room!?</p>
<p><strong>krista</strong>: I had to. Her Security people may be
involved…</p>
<p><strong>mystery man</strong>: Is there a problem, Brendan?</p>
<p><strong>brendan grant</strong>: There certainly is. This man says
he’s been hired to kill Eleanor.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Not hired. They’re blackmailing me.</p>
<p><strong>mystery man</strong>: Who is this “they”?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: I don’t…I don’t know. Please, Mr. Grant! They
have my daughter. I’m not some lunatic. Your wife is in trouble. Someone
is trying to kill her. Someone is trying to make me kill her. Please,
listen…</p>
<p><strong>mystery man</strong>: And on the strength of this story, you
bring this man to Brendan’s suite? Does that show good judgment,
Ms. Brooks? I’m just a friend of Brendan’s, but it seems to me…</p>
<p><strong>krista</strong>: He brought a gun onto the pool deck.</p>
<p><strong>mystery man</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>krista</strong>: He got onto the pool deck with a gun. How
did he get past her Security carrying a</p>
<p><strong>mystery man</strong>: I see. Where is this gun?</p>
<p><strong>krista i</strong>: Have it.</p>
<p><strong>mystery man</strong>: Well, is it real? Do we know anything
about it?</p>
<p><strong>krista</strong>: It looks real. I don’t know anything about
guns.</p>
<p><strong>mystery man</strong>: Could I see it?</p>
<p><strong>mystery man</strong>: My goodness. It certainly looks
real.</p>
<p><strong>mystery man</strong>: What’s your opinion? You’re the expert
in these matters, supposedly.</p>
<p><strong>brendan grant</strong>: Jesus Christ!</p>
<p>****: Yeah, I’d say it’s real.</p>
<p><strong>mystery man</strong>: Are you out of your fucking mind!?</p>
<p><strong>officer trust</strong>: Somebody mind telling me… What the
hell happened!?</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Help me get her off the rug.</p>
<p><strong>brendan grant</strong>: What have you done to me!? Christ
almighty!</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: You fucked up.</p>
<p><strong>mystery man</strong>: That’s enough.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: You want me to kill your kid!? You want
me to kill you!?</p>
<p><strong>mystery man</strong>: Don’t let him go!</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: I killed you.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: You fucked up.</p>
<p><strong>mystery man</strong>: You nearly killed him, too, you
idiot!</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Nearly doesn’t count.</p>
<p><strong>brendan grant</strong>: I’m on record. I never wanted this. I
wanted simplicity; a telescopic sight, a powerful rifle, but no. What
was good enough for Oswald wasn’t good enough for you two. You had to
get fancy. Drag some shmuck in off the street, stick a gun in his
hand.</p>
<p><strong>mystery man</strong>: It’s academic now. She had to be
killed.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: What were you going to do, Brendan? Lock
her in a closet? You’re in the fucking kitchen now. Get used to the
heat. He’s been seen all over the hotel, looking like some Loony Tunes.
We even got him on video. It’ll work. Don’t worry about it.</p>
<p><strong>mystery man</strong>: Is he awake?</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>brendan grant</strong>: Oh Great. Why don’t we just give him
our home phone numbers while we’re at it?</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: It doesn’t matter what he hears.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: That’s what it looks like. She was alive
a minute ago. Now she’s dead. Because you wouldn’t do what I told you to
do.</p>
<p><strong>mystery man</strong>: Get going. You’ve only got a few
minutes to pull it together.</p>
<p><strong>mystery man</strong>: It’s too late for that.</p>
<p><strong>brendan grant</strong>: There is a dead woman on my bathroom
floor!</p>
<p><strong>mystery mam</strong>: What about it? She’s Eleanor’s
assistant and they will have been shot with the same gun, by the same
lunatic. Some, anonymous loser who went over the edge.</p>
<p><strong>brendan grant</strong>: Only thing better would be if he were
a postal worker.</p>
<p><strong>officer trust</strong>: He won’t be doing any work once I get
through with him.</p>
<p><strong>mystery man</strong>: And in a few months you’re in the
Governor’s mansion. The people’d make you king of California if they
could.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: I’m not stupid.. I know how this is supposed,
to work.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Do you now, Mr. Watson?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: I kill her - and you kill me.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Keep your voice down.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Even if you don’t, Her Security men will.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: How am I supposed to get away?</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: That’s not my problem, Mr. Watson</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Come back.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: How do I know you won’t kill my daughter once
I’m gone?</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Come Back….Fucking Radio.</p>
<p><strong>mr.smith</strong>: I told you she’d be alright, if you do
your job.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: And I’m supposed to trust you?</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: What choice do you have?</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: After you.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Look out there! You see the van?</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: You see it?!</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Come back.</p>
<p><strong>ms. jones</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Do it!</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Daddy…?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Lynn!</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Security. Take the next car.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Again.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: No, please…</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: You got one last chance. Half an hour and
that kid is dead. I’ll kill her myself. I’ll rip her fucking head off
right in front of you!</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Daddy, did you hear me scream?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: She told me to scream as loud as I could. Did
you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: The next time I tell you to do something,
you goddamn well do it!</p>
<p><strong>ms. jones</strong>: Hey, fuck you! You want to baby-sit a
screaming kid in traffic, come out here and do it yourself. He got the
message, didn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Having a rough day? Down at the heels as they
say? What you need is a shoe shine, shoe shine, shoe shine today.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Take ten, take a break, take a seat, take a
load off. Put the world in perspective.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: So, are you a visitor or are you lucky enough
to…</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: You got a complaint?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: You remember me?</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: I remember. The big tipper.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Something is going to happen. When it’s over
you’ll know what I was talking about.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Oh, man…</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Please. Something is going to happen…</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: What? The end of the world? Man, don’t give me
your mad rap. I’m not a bartender. I don’t want to hear it. I raise a
family doing this bullshit. Do me a favor. Get your crazy white ass out
of my chair.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Please…</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Hey, a big tip doesn’t give you the right to
crap in my ear. You want change? You got it, brother. What was that you
gave me, a twenty?</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Come on, let’s get some privacy.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: He’s deaf.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: He can’t hear a word we’re saying.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: You wouldn’t be kidding me now, would
you, Mr. Watson? Hey, nigger! Is that right? You can’t hear me?
Nigger?</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Why, looky-here. My customer-quotient just got
multiplied by two. What do you think of that? You’ll have to forgive me,
sir. Didn’t hear your approach. Fact of the matter is, I’m deef as a
post. Compliments of the United States Army… …Artillery Corps. Can I
give you a shine, sir? You don’t see your face, you don’t pay.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Yeah, sure, give me a shine… …shine.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: I’m putting your toy back in your pocket,
Mr. Watson.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: It’s all wound up. Now let’s get out your
itinerary.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: One thirty. California Ballroom.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: That’s right. That gives you…</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: …twenty-six minutes to get your shit
together.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Let me talk to her again.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: I want’to talk to her.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Forget about it.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: I talk to her or you can forget about it.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Don’t you threaten me.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: What are you going to do about it, shoot
me?</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: You know what I’m gonna do.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: What? Walk out there and twist her arm
off?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: It would be a lot less trouble just to let me
talk to her.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Come Back.</p>
<p><strong>ms. jones</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Put her on.</p>
<p><strong>ms. jones</strong>: What gives?</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Just put her on.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Daddy?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Yes, sweetie, it’s me.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: I’m tired. I want to.go now.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: I know you do, honey.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Can we go now?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Not just yet, baby. There’s…there’s something
Daddy has to do.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: To be a hero?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: No, honey, not to be a hero. But I want you to
remember something for me, all right?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: He’s doing it for you. No matter what anybody
tells you, no matter who they are, he’s doing it for you, because he
loves you.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: That’s enough.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Will you promise me that?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: I promise.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: All right. Kisses to you.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: No…kisses to you.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: No. Kisses to you.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: No, kisses to…</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: I don’t care who the fuck you do it for
just so you do it. Hey.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: You done yet?</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Just about.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Two dollars, if it pleases you.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: It doesn’t. I remember when it was a
fuckin’ quarter.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Twenty-five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Thanks for the tip.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Mister, what are you dragging me into?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: I’m not dragging you into anything. I don’t
expect…</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Cover your mouth.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: This gorilla’s watching you, is that
right?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Then don’t let him be seeing you talking to
me. I don’t want him twisting my arm off.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: That was your kid on the walkie- talkie?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: My daughter. They have her in a van across the
street. They say they’ll kill her if I don’t do something for them.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: In twenty-five minutes in the California
Ballroom.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: There was a woman. She was trying to help me.
I watched him murder her.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: What are you supposed to do?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Kill the Governor.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: I knew I should have packed up and gone home
as soon as I got that twenty. What am I supposed to do about this
situation?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: One of them is in on it. He might even be in
charge. Her Security is in on it. There’s only one person I know for
sure isn’t in on it.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: The Governor. If I could just talk to her…</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Oh, Jesus …</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: No way, there’s nothing you can do to help
me.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Then why’d you drag me into it?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: It’s my kid. I’ve got to…to somehow…do right
by my little girl.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: It’s about time I did. I was one of those
guys, workaholics. I worked my ass off for them - my wife, my daughter.
That’s just what I thought I was supposed to do.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Yeah, all right, listen…</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: So when she wanted a divorce…I was…I didn’t
know what I’d done wrong. I didn’t see it. I didn’t see it….</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Why don’t you tell me about the early years
some other time?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: I’m sorry. You understand I don’t mind dying
if I could save my daughter. I mean that.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Yeah, now listen. I can’t mess with these
shoes any more or it’s gonna look funny. You go down get yourself
something to drink. Make sure Godzilla there, follows you.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: I haven’t the faintest idea. Go on now. I’ll
get word to you.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: If nothing else, someone heard my story.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Keep the change.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Don’t think I won’t.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: I need a drink.</p>
<p><strong>game show host</strong>: …and time is running out…</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Give me a …a gingerale?</p>
<p><strong>t.v. news technician 1</strong>: Man, I thought she was going
to get out the violins.</p>
<p><strong>tv reporter</strong>: No shit. If I hear that stop the
violence routine one more time I’m going to shoot somebody.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Here’s your Ginger Ale, sir.</p>
<p><strong>down the bar:</strong>: T.V. NEWS TECHNICIAN 1
Politicians.</p>
<p><strong>tv reporter</strong>: They’re all the same.</p>
<p><strong>tv reporter</strong>: You know what bothers me?</p>
<p><strong>tv reporter</strong>: When they get all weepy eyed about the
“ordinary citizen”, the “regular Joe”, the “normal American”. Gimme a
break. There ain’t no such animal. We’re a nation of two hundred forty
million special interest groups.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Well, I’m just a regular guy.</p>
<p><strong>tv reporter</strong>: Is that right?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Yeah, that’s right. But I’ve built a good
solid business out of nothing. Don’t underestimate the regular guy.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Sir, you haven’t paid.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: It’s on the Special Interest at the end of the
bar.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Hey, Sir, don’t make me call a cop.</p>
<p><strong>t.v. news technician 1</strong>: Left field bleachers heard
from.</p>
<p><strong>t.v. reporter</strong>: Laughs.</p>
<p><strong>officer trust</strong>: Where is he? Did you lose him?</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Let’s all hope so.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Quick, off with the shoes and pants. Trade
with Gustino. The big guy’s coming.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: C’mon, ladies. No time to be shy.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Gustino! Drop ’em!</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: And cover up them socks. Man, who dresses
you?</p>
<p><strong>janitor</strong>: Fue.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Meet Irene.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Irene is going to help.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Where am I going?</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: You said there was only one person you knew
wasn’t in on this thing.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: You’re going to go see her.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: What!?</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: You sure she’s asleep?</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: I took up extra pillows. She take a nap
before her big speech.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: What am I supposed to say to her?</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: It’ll come to you. See if you can stop this
thing ’fore it gets started. Save us all considerable embarrassment.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Irene…?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Excuse me…</p>
<p><strong>eleanor grant</strong>: Who the hell are you?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: No, please.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Mrs. Grant, Governor…I won’t hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor grant</strong>: My security people are right next
door.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: I appreciate that.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor grant</strong>: One loud scream will bring them in
here instantly. You won’t get very far. Think it over.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: If I were here to hurt you I would have done
it already.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor grant</strong>: That’s…a comfort to hear.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: I have a problem.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor grant</strong>: Ah.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Only you can help me. I’m also sorry to say,
my problem is your problem, Mrs. Grant.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor grant</strong>: I remember you…in the elevator.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor grant</strong>: You were very nervous.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: It was because I had this…in my pocket</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: I need you to listen to me. Carefully. Three
lives depend on you listening very carefully to what I have to say.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor grant</strong>: Of course. But suppose we set up an
appointment. I have an important speech to deliver and you’re cutting
into my nap time.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Krista Brooks is dead.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor grant</strong>: How do you know that?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: I saw her die. She was shot. With this
gun.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor grant</strong>: You shot her?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor grant</strong>: Who did?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: I don’t know. The only thing I know about him
is that he works for your husband.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor grant</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: And your husband works for somebody else.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor grant</strong>: What the hell are you saying?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: He’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Hey, Gustino, what takes you so long? You
need to eat more fiber.</p>
<p><strong>gustino</strong>: You got anything to read?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: I knew you wouldn’t believe me.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor grant</strong>: I said I’d listen to you, not
necessarily believe you. You’re telling me my people are in a plot
against me. You’re telling me my husband wants me killed. What do you
expect?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: I don’t blame you. I don’t have any proof. But
nothing like this occurs in a vacuum. You can’t be totally oblivious.
You must suspect something. You’re doing things which are making people
angry. People who have been in power a long time are losing their jobs.
You know them better than me. How much does it mean to them? How far
would they go to hang onto it?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: There’s only one way to find out for sure. Try
to cancel the last speech.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor grant</strong>: I’d prefer we didn’t refer to it as
my last speech.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: It’s the last chance they have for me to kill
you. Try to get out of it. They won’t let you. They can’t. Try to change
the schedule and you’ll know I’m right. What have you got to lose? It
comes down to who you trust, them or me? Test them.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor grant</strong>: I love it when pistolero’s talk of
trust.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: This? I’ve never even fired one.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor grant</strong>: Indeed.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor grant</strong>: Franco! Franco.’</p>
<p><strong>franco</strong>: What is it, Governor!? What’s wrong!?</p>
<p><strong>eleanor grant</strong>: I…I’m afraid I’ve had a bad dream,
Franco.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: What are you going to do now?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: I don’t know. I have to get back.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: What are you going to do!?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: This is about power and you haven’t got any.
There’s nothing more you can do. I’m sorry. Thanks for trying.</p>
<p><strong>officer trust</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: In the john.</p>
<p><strong>officer trust</strong>: Get moving.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: You’ oughta learn to relax. I told you
I’ve got it under control.</p>
<p><strong>officer trust</strong>: It’s time. It’s time now.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Where are we going?</p>
<p><strong>ms. jones</strong>: Not very far, honey-pie. Not far at
all.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Out of there, Mr. Watson! Your time’s
up!</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: You forgot to wash your hands.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: I’ve got faith in you, Mr. Watson. I know
you’re not just a regular guy, see, I know that. Even if you don’t know
it yourself. Maybe that’s why I picked you.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: I know what I have to do. I’ll do it. Let’s
go.</p>
<p><strong>brendan grant</strong>: Hey, El, how’s the head?</p>
<p><strong>mystery man</strong>: Eleanor.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor grant</strong>: Lousy. And I have siesta hair. I’m
thinking of canceling the speech.</p>
<p><strong>brendan grant</strong>: It’s an important speech.</p>
<p><strong>mystery man</strong>: I’d say critical, not that it’s any of
my business.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor grant</strong>: It’s just another speech in a Tower
of Babel so high that Nimrod himself would be put to shame. Cancel. Make
my apologies.</p>
<p><strong>brendan grant</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>mystery man</strong>: I’ll trot along. Nice to see you,
Eleanor.</p>
<p><strong>brendan grant</strong>: During a campaign every speech is
important. This is free media exposure. Primetime news coverage that we
couldn’t buy.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor grant</strong>: What’s he doing here?</p>
<p><strong>brendan grant</strong>: Who, him? Just visiting.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor grant t</strong>: Hings have changed, Brendan. I
thought you understood that.</p>
<p><strong>brendan grant</strong>: He’s my friend. And he did help you
to get elected, after all.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor grant</strong>: Don’t remind me.</p>
<p><strong>brendan grant</strong>: What happened here?</p>
<p><strong>eleanor grant</strong>: Nothing. I broke a lamp.</p>
<p><strong>brendan grant</strong>: Eleanor, please. I’ll put it this
way. This speech or a half-dozen rubber chicken-fund raisers. What do
you say?</p>
<p><strong>eleanor grant</strong>: Truth is, besides the headache I’ve
come down with a little lower intestinal havoc. Make my apologies.</p>
<p><strong>brendan grant</strong>: Come on, El, you’re a trooper. I’ll
get you some Pepto, you’ll make one of your patented tributes to the
common person, then back to Sacramento. This is no time to lay down on
the job. I don’t care what the polls say, you can’t afford to relax.
Look what happened to Bush. Tell you what, if you want to blow off the
Sacramento speech, fine. But do this one and we’ll get out of the
smog.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor grant</strong>: All right, I’ll do it.</p>
<p><strong>brendan grant</strong>: That’s my girl.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor grant</strong>: But I want to make some changes. Get
Krista in here right away won’t you?</p>
<p><strong>brendan grant</strong>: Aw, gee. I sent her on an errand.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor grant</strong>: You sent my assistant on an
errand.</p>
<p><strong>brendan grant</strong>: I’ve been a bad boy.</p>
<p><strong>politico</strong>: Ladies, gentlemen, it is my great pleasure
to introduce to you the esteemed spouse of our Governor. Let’s give a
big L.A. welcome to Mr. Brendan Grant.</p>
<p><strong>brendan grant</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen of the press,
campaign volunteers, and those of you who were looking for any excuse to
take off work for the afternoon…</p>
<p><strong>brendan grant</strong>: We have with us today the first woman
Governor of our great state…</p>
<p><strong>brendan grant</strong>: Governor Eleanor Samara Grant. What
can I say about her….that won’t get me in trouble when I get home
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>t.v. news technician</strong>: Charlie. Charlie. Charlie, are
you reading me?</p>
<p><strong>brendan grant</strong>: She’s a woman who loves our great
state.</p>
<p><strong>t.v. news technician</strong>: Charlie… I can’t get shit on
this stupid radio.</p>
<p><strong>brendan grant</strong>: A brilliant legislator.</p>
<p><strong>brendan grant</strong>: …who will soon win her second term as
the greatest Governor California has ever seen!</p>
<p><strong>t.v. news technician</strong>: Somebody’s going to ave to run
down to the truck. Tell them this radio’s fucked.</p>
<p><strong>t.v. news technician</strong>: I can’t get through.
Walkie-Talkies don’t work from here. There’s too much concrete and
stuff.</p>
<p><strong>brendan grant</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen…</p>
<p><strong>t.v. news technician</strong>: Nothin’s getting out.</p>
<p><strong>brendan grant</strong>: I am honored to present to you our
esteemed Governor and my beloved wife, Eleanor Samara Grant!</p>
<p><strong>eleanor grant</strong>: Thank you! Thank you all!</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Look out! Look out!</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Look out!</p>
<p><strong>brendan grant</strong>: My God, he did it!</p>
<p><strong>officer trust</strong>: You little son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor grant</strong>: Are you all right, Franco?</p>
<p><strong>franco</strong>: I’d be better if they’d put sleeves on these
damn vests.</p>
<p><strong>ms. jones</strong>: It’s time….You read me? I don’t hear from
you I’m going ahead now.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Why do you keep looking at me?</p>
<p><strong>ms. jones</strong>: That’s my job. I’m your babysitter.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: I’m not a baby.</p>
<p><strong>ms. jones</strong>: You’re a big girl, huh?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: I’m not a big girl but I’m not a baby.</p>
<p><strong>ms. jones</strong>: Close your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>ms. jones</strong>: I’ve got something for you.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: A surprise?</p>
<p><strong>ms. jones</strong>: You ask too many questions. You want the
surprise or not?</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Good afternoon, madam. Hello there, little
girl.</p>
<p><strong>ms. jones</strong>: Hey, hey, what are you doing!?</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Just giving you the gift of a clean
windshield. Only cost you a dollar.</p>
<p><strong>ms. jones</strong>: I don’t want my windshield cleaned.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: You just think you don’t want your windshield
cleaned.</p>
<p><strong>ms. jones</strong>: No, I know I don’t want it cleaned. Get
out of here.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Don’t be like that. Think of me as the Moses
of dirty windshields leading you through the desert of dead bugs.</p>
<p><strong>ms. jones</strong>: For the last time, I don’t want it
cleaned. Now get the hell out of here!</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: It’s already done. I’ve already done it. You
have to pay me now.</p>
<p><strong>ms. jones</strong>: I don’t have to pay you nothin’.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: You’re going to deny me a lousy dollar after
I’ve sweated like a pig giving you the gift of a clean windsheild?</p>
<p><strong>ms. jones</strong>: Fuckin’ A.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>ms. jones</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: I think this is worth a dollar.</p>
<p><strong>ms. jones</strong>: Goddamnit! Gimme that!</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Oh, we’ll have to do better than that.</p>
<p><strong>ms. jones</strong>: You worthless piece of shit! Gimme
that!</p>
<p><strong>ms. jones</strong>: Goddamnit, you fuckin’ bum, come
here!</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Gimme a dollar.</p>
<p><strong>ms. jones</strong>: Fuck you!</p>
<p><strong>ms. jones</strong>: Gimme that thing!</p>
<p><strong>ms. jones</strong>: Goddammit, give it to me, you
Sunnavabitch!</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Daddy blew it.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Very good…Mr. Watson. I told them…I could
make a killer out of you.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: There’s nothing like a good wing- tip.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Lost my watch.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor grant</strong>: Any comment at this time would be
most premature. Please, we’ll have something for you in a couple of
hours. Please…</p>
<p><strong>eleanor grant</strong>: I…1 would like to…thank you, Mister
Wat… Gene.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor grant</strong>: I would also like to apologize.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>eleanor grant</strong>: For not believing you.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Believe me, I don’t blame you. This is the
Governor, Lynn. Say hello.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor grant</strong>: You have a very brave father,
Lynn.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: He’s a hero.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor grant</strong>: Yes, yes he is.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Dads are like that.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Can we go now?</p>
<p><strong>eleanor grant</strong>: Of course. I’ll get a car to drive
you.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: No, that’s… That’s OK. We don’t need any help.
We’ll be just fine. Won’t we, Lynn?</p>
<p><strong>eleanor grant</strong>: Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Same to you.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Thanks for the shine.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Thanks for the tip.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Come on, kid. I gotta make a phone call.</p>
<p><strong>huey</strong>: Kisses to you.</p>
