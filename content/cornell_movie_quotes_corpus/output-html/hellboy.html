<p><strong>old matlin</strong>: Is he real? Oh yeah – Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>old matlin</strong>: I haven’t talked about it for years, you
know? Everyone called me crazy…</p>
<p><strong>old matlin</strong>: But I have the negative.</p>
<p><strong>technician’s voice</strong>: Get ready, 3-2-1… Roll tape.</p>
<p><strong>old matlin</strong>: It all started back in �44. I was a
Corps photographer aboard an allied submarine…</p>
<p><strong>old matlin’s voice</strong>: …off the coast of Scotland.
Classified mission. I was 21…</p>
<p><strong>old matlin’s voice</strong>: We had an English civilian on
board. Not much older than me but already an advisor to President
Roosevelt. “Paranormal” advisor, I kid you not –</p>
<p><strong>old matlin’s voice</strong>: His name was Trevor. Profesor
Trevor –</p>
<p><strong>whitman</strong>: – Broom! Topside, now.</p>
<p><strong>whitman</strong>: The sooner we’re done, the better.</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: This is an important mission, Sgt. Whitman. I
hope you realize that.</p>
<p><strong>whitman</strong>: Oh – you don’t wanna know what I think.
Topside, now.</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: Sgt. Whitman!! Sgt. Whitman!! May I have a
word??</p>
<p><strong>whitman</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: In private, if you don’t mind…</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: Your men – They’ll need these –</p>
<p><strong>whitman</strong>: You are a Catholic??</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: Amongst other things, yes – but that’s hardly
the point.</p>
<p><strong>whitman</strong>: Here. You’ll need one of these.</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: I abhor violence. Sergeant Whitman, I hope
you don’t think me mad –</p>
<p><strong>whitman</strong>: Three days too late for that one,
“professor.”</p>
<p><strong>whitman</strong>: You’re wasting our time: There’s nothing on
this island but sheep and rocks.</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: Ruins. Not rocks. The remains of Trondham
Abbey. Built on an intersection of Ley Lines, the boundaries between our
world and the other –</p>
<p><strong>whitman</strong>: What a load of crap. Hell, a week ago I
hadn’t even heard the word parabnormal –</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: “Paranormal” But – you read the
transmission.</p>
<p><strong>whitman</strong>: Half transmission. Nonsense – German ghost
stories!</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: I have seen ghosts, Whitman.</p>
<p><strong>whitman</strong>: Oh, I’ll bet you have.</p>
<p><strong>matlin</strong>: Sweet Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: They must be here for the sheep.</p>
<p><strong>whitman</strong>: The freak in the gas mask –</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: Karl Ruprecht Kroenen, one of the Reich’s top
Scientists. Head of the Thule Occult Society.</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: If he’s here, this is worse than I
thought.</p>
<p><strong>whitman</strong>: Air and sea backup. What’s closest?</p>
<p><strong>radio man</strong>: Londonderry, sir. Forty minutes away.</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: We don’t have forty minutes.</p>
<p><strong>grigory</strong>: No matter what happens to me, you must
carry on with the work.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: I will not leave you.</p>
<p><strong>grigory</strong>: Yes, you will… Leave me. Deny me.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Never –</p>
<p><strong>grigory</strong>: This will guide you back to me.</p>
<p><strong>grigory</strong>: I grant you everlasting life, youth and the
power to serve me.</p>
<p><strong>von krupt</strong>: It’s time.</p>
<p><strong>von krupt</strong>: Five years of research and construction,
Grigory. Five years!!</p>
<p><strong>von krupt</strong>: The furhrer doesn’t look kindly on
failure.</p>
<p><strong>grigory</strong>: There will be no failure, General. I
promised Herr Hitler a miracle. I’ll deliver one.</p>
<p><strong>grigori</strong>: Tonight, We will open a portal and awaken
the OGDRU JAHAD: The seven Gods of chaos. Our enemies will be destroyed.
In an instant, all impurity in this world will be razed and from the
ashes a new eden will arise.</p>
<p><strong>grigory</strong>: Ragnarok, Anung Ia Anung.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: More Power!! Don’t let the level drop!!</p>
<p><strong>whitman</strong>: Listen to me, you moron: you do that again,
I’ll carve you a new –</p>
<p>****: Listen to me!!! The portal is open!!! We have to stop
them!!!</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Grigory!</p>
<p><strong>matlin</strong>: It’s almost over!!</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: No. It’s not.</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: Cordon off the area. Something came
through.</p>
<p><strong>whitman</strong>: From where??!!</p>
<p><strong>matlin</strong>: Do you believe in hell?</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: There is a place – a dark place where evil
slumbers and awaits to return. From there it infects our dreams. Our
thoughts. Grigory gave us a glance tonight –</p>
<p><strong>matlin</strong>: Grigory – That’s Russian, right? Thought
they were on our side…</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: Grigory Yefimovich Rasputin –</p>
<p><strong>matlin</strong>: C’mon – Rasputin??</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: Spiritual advisor to the Romanovs. In 1916,
at a dinner in his honor, he was poisoned, shot, stabbed, clubbed,
drowned and castrated.</p>
<p><strong>matlin</strong>: That makes him more than a hundred –</p>
<p><strong>matlin</strong>: What the hell was that? An ape?</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: No. It was red. Bright red.</p>
<p><strong>whitman</strong>: What are you two talking about??</p>
<p><strong>matlin</strong>: A red ape.</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: It’s-not-an-ape –</p>
<p><strong>matlin</strong>: It’s got a big stone – in its hand –</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: I think that is its hand.</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: Wait –</p>
<p><strong>young soldier</strong>: Jesus! would’ya look at the size of
that whammer!</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: It’s a boy. Just a baby boy.</p>
<p><strong>old matlin’s voice</strong>: Best photo of my career –</p>
<p><strong>old matlin</strong>: and no one has ever seen it. They keep
saying he’s not real, but I want to set the record straight before I
go.</p>
<p><strong>old matlin</strong>: Here. The real picture, not the
retouched one in LIFE magazine. This is him. The very same night we
found him. The night Broom gave him that name. Can I say it on TV? He
called him –</p>
<p><strong>tom manning</strong>: Look at that. That’s a costume. These
people amaze me.</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: With their conveniently blurry footage of
their beloved “Hellboy.” And they claim that he works for the FBI-?</p>
<p><strong>tv host</strong>: As the head of your division, you – You
have seen dozens of pictures like this!!!</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: Exactly – so, why is it that they’re all
out of focus? C’mon!! God knows, people manage to get good pictures at a
wedding!!</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: That’s the alleged best man – ?</p>
<p><strong>peasant guide</strong>: I will guide you no further.</p>
<p><strong>peasant guide</strong>: We shouldn’t be here –</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Your eyes. What did they do to your eyes?</p>
<p><strong>doctor 1</strong>: Have you told him yet?</p>
<p><strong>doctor 2</strong>: Malignant sarcoma. In the lungs… the
spine, liver…</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: Approximately… how long??</p>
<p><strong>doctor 2</strong>: Maybe – six weeks.</p>
<p><strong>doctor 2</strong>: I can arrange for hospitalization, pain
management. Make the time more bearable –</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: I’d rather… stay home, you know. I’ll be
making arrangements – For my son.</p>
<p><strong>doctor 2</strong>: You can always get a second opinion.</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: That won’t be necessary.</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: Son…</p>
<p><strong>tv host</strong>: Mister Manning, what about the “Bureau for
Paranormal Research and Defense?” The FBI has been known to conceal
–</p>
<p><strong>tom manning</strong>: That word – conceal –</p>
<p><strong>tv host</strong>: from the American public –</p>
<p><strong>tom manning</strong>: Phil – Phil – hold your little green
horses. Let me tell you and the American public one thing – this “Bureau
for – what was it?</p>
<p><strong>tv host</strong>: Paranormal Research and –</p>
<p><strong>tom manning</strong>: – Defense, right, well – I’m here to
clear up this once and for all. There-is-no-such-thing.</p>
<p><strong>intercom voice</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: John Myers, F.B.I. Transfer from
Quantico.</p>
<p><strong>intercom voice</strong>: Look at the birdie, son.</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: Hello, I’m –</p>
<p><strong>lobby guard</strong>: – Late. Five minutes late.</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: Yes, I –</p>
<p><strong>lobby guard</strong>: – Section fifty-one. Step back.</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: Pardon?</p>
<p><strong>lobby guard</strong>: Two steps back, please.</p>
<p><strong>lobby guard</strong>: Watch your hands and elbows.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Turn the pages, please.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Over here… if you don’t mind?</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: Jesus Christ!</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: These – ? You’re reading these – ?</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: Four books at once. Every day – as long as
I’m here to turn the pages. My name’s Broom. Professor Trevor Broom.</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: Sir, I’m –</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Agent John T. Myers, Kansas City, 76. “T”
stands for Thaddeus, mother’s older brother. Scar on your chin happened
when you were ten, you still wonder if it’s ever going to fade away.</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: How did it –</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: – He. Not “it.”</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: Abraham Sapien. Discovered alive in a secret
chamber at St. Trinian’s Foundling Hospital, Washington.</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: They took his name from this little
inscription that was stuck on his tank.</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: Icthyo Sapiens, April 14, 1865.</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: The day Abraham Lincoln died. Hence “Abe”
Sapien.</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: Rotten eggs, a delicacy. Abe loves them.</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: How does he know so much about me?</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: Abe possesses a unique frontal lobe.
“Unique.” That’s a word you’ll hear quite a bit around here.</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: Where am I – exactly, Sir?</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: As you entered the lobby there was an
inscription –</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: On the desk, yes. In Latin.</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: Impressive. Do you remember what it said?</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: “In absentia luci, tenebrae vinciunt…”</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: “In the absence of light, darkness prevails.”
For there are things that go bump in the night, Agent Myers. We are the
ones who bump back.</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: 1937: Hitler joins “The Thule Society” – a
group of German aristocrats obsessed with the occult.</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: 1938: he acquires the Spear of Longinus,
which pierced the body of Christ. He who holds it becomes
invincible.</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: Hitler’s power increases tenfold.</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: In 1943, President Roosevelt decides to fight
back. THE BUREAU FOR PARANORMAL RESEARCH AND DEFENSE is born.</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: 1958, the occult war finally ends when Adolf
Hitler dies.</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: 1945, you mean. Hitler died in ’45.</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: Did he, now?</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: Agent Myers, this is Agent Clay. Follow his
lead.</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: You’re not coming?</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: I hand-picked you from a roster of over
seventy academy graduates. Make me proud.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: They’re not speaking. Professor Broom had him
grounded.</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: Grounded? Who’s grounded?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Okay. You saw the fish man, right?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Well, come on in and meet the rest of the
family.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: He gets fed six times a day. He’s got a thing
for cats. You’ll be his nanny, his keeper, his best friend. He never
goes out unsupervised –</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: Who?!</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: You’re kidding –</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Those comics – They never got the eyes
right.</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: Oh, Jesus!! Hellboy – ?? Is real –</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Yup. Sixty years old by our count. But he
doesn’t age like we do – think dog years: He’s barely out of his
teens.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: What’s with the hair, Clay?? Finally got
those implants??</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: It’ll fill in. Where do you want your dinner,
Red? By the couch?</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Who’s the squirt?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Agent Myers is your new liaison.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Got tired of me?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Nah. I’ll be around, Red, just back in the
field.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: I don’t want him.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Manning says I’m too soft on you – The candy.
Give him the candy.</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: Oh. Uh. Hello. I – I have these. For you.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Father’s back? Still angry?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Well, you did break out –</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: I wanted to see her. It’s nobody’s
business.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: It is. You got yourself on TV again.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: “Myers”, huh? You have a first name??</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Try not to stare. He hates when people
stare.</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: Uh-oh – John. Staring at what?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: His horns. He files ’em. To “fit in.”</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: His what??!!</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Whatcha looking at, John??</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: Oh-n-no – I –</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Hey, hey, hey. They’re playing our
song.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: We’re on the move.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: C’mon, Champ! Happy Halloween!!! You’re
taking me for a walk!</p>
<p><strong>blonde reporter</strong>: The NYPD has yet to issue a
statement. We’ve got SWAT vans, paramedics, you name it… and now here’s
– a garbage truck – – a garbage truck?</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Look at them ugly suckers, Blue. One sheet
of glass between them and us.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Story of my life.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: I break it, they see us, Happy Halloween.
No more hiding. Outside. I could be outside –</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: You mean, outside… with her.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Don’t get psychic with me.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Nothing psychic about it. You’re easy.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: How am I ever gonna get a girl?? I drive
around in a garbage truck</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Liz left us, Red. Take the hint.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: We don’t take hints.</p>
<p><strong>stone</strong>: All areas secured.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Seal the doors. Red and Blue are coming
in.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Okay, boys, let’s synch up our locators.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: At nineteen hundred hours an alarm tripped.
B&amp;E. Robbery. Six guards dead –</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Hold on – hold on – I thought we checked
this place. Fakes, and reproductions.</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: Apparently not everything was fake.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Father…?</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: A 16th century statue was destroyed. Saint
Dionysius the Aeropagite.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Who wards off demons.</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: Smuggled into this country by an overzealous
curator. The statue, however, was hollow –</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Reliquary –</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: A prison. The Vatican deemed its contents
dangerous enough to include it on the List of Avignon. Of which we hold
a copy.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Would’ya look at this babies? Made ’em
myself. Holy water, silver shavings, white oak: the works.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Behind this door. A dark entity – Evil, ancient
and hungry.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Oh, well. Lemme go in and say “hi”.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Blue: It stinks in here – Finely aged
roadkill.</p>
<p><strong>sammael</strong>: equipped with powerful arms, a head full of
tentacles and two well-muscled hind legs. Most of its face is hidden,
but the jaws are shiny with blood.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Hey. Stinky. Kitchen’s closed. Whatcha
havin’? Six library guards, raw? Plus belts and boots? Man, you’re gonna
need some heavy fiber to move that out –</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Red, I found something –</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: There’s not much here: the entity’s name is
Sammael, the desolate one, son of Nergal –</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Hold it – Hey, Sammy, whaddayasay we work
this out?? Peacefully. I’m not a great shot, but – “The Samaritan” here,
uses really big bullets, so whadyasay we work this out?</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: That’s all for you, Sammy.</p>
<p><strong>abe’s voice</strong>: Red – you need to hear the rest of the
information –</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Nah – he’s taken care of.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: No, listen this: Sammael, the desolate one,
lord of the shadows, son of Nergal –</p>
<p><strong>abe’s voice</strong>: hound of resurrection –</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: See? I don’t like that –</p>
<p><strong>abe’s voice</strong>: – Hound of resurrection?</p>
<p><strong>abe’s voice</strong>: harbinger of pestilence, seed of
destruction –</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Skip to the end, willya? How do I kill it –
?</p>
<p><strong>abe’s voice</strong>: It doesn’t say –</p>
<p><strong>grigory’s voice</strong>: Child…</p>
<p><strong>grigory</strong>: All grown up, I see.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: That voice –</p>
<p><strong>grigory</strong>: I sang the first lullaby you ever heard, my
child. I ushered you into this world. I alone know your true calling,
your true name.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Don’t tell me, it’s Zeppo.</p>
<p><strong>grigory</strong>: I can see that you’re still young and don’t
know your place. Teach him.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: What do you think you’re doing??</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: Helping you – I just –</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: No one ever helps me. It’s my job.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Damn – Okay. Here –</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: – Then load this.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: It’s a tracking bullet. Crack the pin. Load
it.</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: Jeez… What the hell is that?</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Lemme go ask –</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: Wait! No, what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>worker 1</strong>: What the hell is that??</p>
<p><strong>3 workers</strong>: Whoa-whoa-whoa-</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: We’ll hit the street in a minute. We’re
heading towards civilians…</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: Yeah, yeah, crazy costume, uh? Trick or
treat!!</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Good. Stay here.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Waiting for me, Sammy?</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Uh-oh – between a rock and a hard place
–</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Aw, crap –</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Hey! Hey! I’m on your side!!</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Aw, I forgot –</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Screw you.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: I’m fireproof. You weren’t.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Myers??? How’s your arm?</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: My arm is fine. Where are you??</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: Where are you???</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: I just fried Stinky. Tell Father I’ll be
home. He shouldn’t wait up.</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: Wait – Wait – You can’t go anywhere – I gotta
go with you –</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: No, no, no, it’s fine: I do my job, I take
a break.</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: No. Stop. Don’t do this – Listen to me – Tell
me where you are –</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Myers?</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>grigory</strong>: Sammael has fulfilled his destiny… Die in
peace and be reborn again and again…</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Only seven more days to the eclipse,
Grishka…</p>
<p><strong>grigory</strong>: The child will be there. And so will we all
– Won’t we?</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: Every time the media get a look at him,
they come to me. I’m running out of lies, Trevor.</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: I thought you liked being on TV.</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: I do. How many escapes? This year alone:
five!</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: Tom – he’s our guest, not a prisoner.</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: Your “guest” happens to be six foot five,
bright red, and is government funded.</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: He’s just going through a phase –</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: A “phase”? What do you think this is, “The
Brady Bunch?” These… freaks –</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: These freaks, Trevor, they give me the
creeps. And I’m not the only one. You’re up for review. You and your
petting zoo.</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: I know where to find him. I’ll get him
back.</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: Hey, fishstick – don’t touch anything –</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: I need to touch it to “see”…</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: See what??</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: The past, the future, whatever this object
holds.</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: Is he serious??</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Don’t worry about fingerprints. I never had
any.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: They were over here, Professor.</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: Oooh!! Who was here? Nixon? Houdini? You
mind sharing your mystic insights?</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: Show me, Abe… show me.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Move.</p>
<p><strong>guard 1</strong>: You! Don’t move! Hands up!</p>
<p><strong>guard 6</strong>: Don’t –</p>
<p><strong>grigory</strong>: Ready the welcome, my love –</p>
<p><strong>grigory</strong>: Salt. Gathered from the tears of a thousand
martyrs. Restraining the essence of Sammael, the hell hound, the seed of
destruction.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Professor..? You – are very sick –</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: I don’t want Hellboy to know –</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: Sixty years ago Abe, they tried to destroy
the world. And they are back – in my lifetime, they are back. To finish
the job.</p>
<p><strong>down’s patient</strong>: There’s a big red guy down
there!</p>
<p><strong>doctor marsh</strong>: That’s fine, darling, Santa’s not here
for another month.</p>
<p><strong>down’s patient</strong>: Not Santa. Big and red. With gold
eyes. And he has beer!</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Back so soon?</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Uh, I brought beer.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: To wash down my lithium pills? I may get a few
perks, H.B. But I’m still a patient.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: You better have that looked at.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Just a scratch. I wanted to see you.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: We miss you at the Bureau. Abe’s crazier
every day. And Father’s still mad at me – Come back, Liz. Come back. I
–</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: No. Not this time, H.B. It’s been months since
I’ve had an episode. And you know what? I’m learning to control it.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: I’m learning where it comes from. And for once
in my life I’m not afraid.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Looks like your ride is here.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: The Nanny Squad.</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: Sir, may I go first??</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Not so fast. He barely knows him –</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: Then he should make it his business to change
that.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Listen, H.B. I’ve got a chance out here. If you
truly care about me, don’t come back anymore.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Goodnight, then.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Yeah, I gotta go, too. Lots to do –</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: What took you so long?</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: C’mon, time to go home. Tape you up.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: What are you, a Boy Scout?</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: No. I never was.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Could’ve fooled me. Go away.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: C’mon, champ. You look a little woozy,
there.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: This – ? This is nothing. You know what’ll
kill me? Her.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: You were burned by some organic acid.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: I’m lucky that way.</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: Son. About Rasputin –</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Don’t worry. I’ll get him soon enough –</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: Listen to me. This time is different. There’s
more at stake than ever before.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: How hard can it be? I punched the crap out
of that thing that he sent – ouch!!</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: I worry about you.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Me?? C’mon –</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: Well, I won’t be around forever, you
know?</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Oh, stop that – Damn! Be careful, there
–</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Red. How long was it latched onto you?</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: I dunno, maybe five seconds – ow!</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: You want me to hold him down?</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: That’s right, Stud, hold me down.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Professor…</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: Don’t look! Turn around.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Is it bad?</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Touched you five seconds. Laid three eggs.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Didn’t even buy me a drink.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: The eggs are very sensitive to heat and light.
They need a humid, dark environment to breed.</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: Down there. Did you ever loose track of
him?</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Well, let’s see – there was that moment,
when I had a train on top of my head –</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: We can’t risk it: You’ll go back to the
tracks tomorrow with a group of agents, search the area, top to
bottom.</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: I’m in way over my head, I know that
much.</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: You’re doing fine.</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: No, I’m not. He respects Clay. Not me. I
don’t know why you chose me, Sir. But I’m not qualified.</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: I’m dying Agent Myers.</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: And as a father, I worry about him. In
medieval stories, Agent Myers, there’s often a young knight,
inexperienced but pure of heart…</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: Oh, please. I’m not “pure of heart.”</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Yes, you are.</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: What I ask from you is – Have the courage to
stand by his side after I’m gone. Help him find himself. Who he must be.
He was born a Demon… You will help him become a man.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: I don’t like the term “firestarter.” I just
don’t. And “Pyrokinesis” sounds like psychosis or something. I dunno –
maybe that’s right. Not being able to let go – Scary. Sometimes you hear
so-and-so lost control and just exploded. They’re lucky it isn’t true.
With me – it is.</p>
<p><strong>grigory</strong>: The Master is calling your name now, my
girl. We are all part of his plan. You must return to the child… So,
once again…</p>
<p><strong>grigory</strong>: …dream of fire.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Liz!! Liz!! Come on, darling, give Mummy a
hand.</p>
<p><strong>blonde kid</strong>: Freak!</p>
<p><strong>blonde kid</strong>: See? She knows her name.</p>
<p><strong>blonde kid</strong>: Go home, you freak. We don’t want you
here.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Not again, please, not again…</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Mommy! Mommy!</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Mommy! Help me! I’m burning!</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Help meee!!!</p>
<p><strong>orderly</strong>: Oh my –</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: How many buildings does she have to burn?
She belongs here!</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: That’s not how she feels. She may never feel
it.</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: It’s her choice – She’s human –</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Oh, as opposed to – ?</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Mmmh – “Pamcakes.” We’re going out –</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: Professor, that girl you were talking about
–</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Hey. You: think twice –</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: I think I can help – Talk to her – I can
bring her back.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: What landed you this job, pushing
“pamcakes”? Punctuality? What was your area of expertise?</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: What was that??</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: Hostage negotiations.</p>
<p><strong>doctor marsh</strong>: She’s been like this since it
happened. There were no casualties. But it’s put a big dent in our
Thorazine supply… Are you sure you want to go in?</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: Miss Sherman? I’m Agent Myers, FBI.</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: Miss Sherman? I’m Agent Myers, FBI. The
hospital called us. They don’t feel they’re capable of caring for you
any longer, and –</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: Liz – can I call you Liz? It’s a beautiful
name –</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: It’s still impressive by my standards: My
name’s John.</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: Dr. Broom asked me to invite you back to the
Bureau. No special precautions, no security escorts. You and me in a
taxi. Like regular folks.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Doesn’t sounds like him.</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: Miss Sherman, he’s asking you back, but it’s
entirely your choice.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Choice, huh? That’s cute. I’ve quit the Bureau
thirteen times. I always go back. Where else would I go?</p>
<p><strong>quarry</strong>: We’re in the cellar of the Benjamin
Institute. Turn-of-the-century orphanage. Closed since they moved the
sewers in ’51.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: There’s a pulse. And it’s coming from –</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: there –</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: cistern on the other side. Most of the eggs are
there –</p>
<p><strong>agent quarry</strong>: No way in.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: We should go back and request permission to
–</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Are you coming or not?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: You two, check this dump, then join us –</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: I’m glad I’m not human. This place would be an
embarrassment.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: There you go, Doctor. This should cover
your tailfin – On loan from the Vatican, a bone from Saint Dionysius.
Ugh. Looks like a pinky.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Remind me why I keep doing this.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Rotten eggs and the safety of mankind.</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Oh, right –</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: See? It’s thicker. Isn’t it? It’s not that
doll-hair thing –</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Son of a – !</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Red, wait!</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Red’s on the move!! I’ll cover him!!</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Damn it, Red.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: “Sammael: seed of destruction. Death
becomes the fertile ground.”</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Didn’t I kill you already?</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Hey, Chunk-face!</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: You can do better than that. Big monster
like you.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: See? It hurts! You shouldn’t hit
people!</p>
<p><strong>yound girl</strong>: My kittens!! My kittens!!!</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Aw, crap.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Second date. No tongue!!</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: I hope that hurt.</p>
<p><strong>young girl</strong>: Thank you –</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: My job.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: This time. Stay dead, willya??</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Abe – ?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Jesus –</p>
<p><strong>quarry</strong>: Abe –</p>
<p><strong>quarry</strong>: Moss, what the hell was that?</p>
<p><strong>quarry</strong>: Whatever it was –</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: We need an ambulance. Now!! Over!!</p>
<p><strong>hellboy’s voice</strong>: Who’s there? Clay? Come in,
someone.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Clay, Code 30, this is Clay, over…</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: It feels good to be outside!! It’s been so
long…</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: Hey!! The music!! Turn down the music!!</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Yeah, yeah, music!!</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: Jesus! That’s not – That’s not safe, Miss
Sherman – Miss Sherman?</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: Nice view –</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: A smile, huh? That’s good.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Don’t get used to it.</p>
<p><strong>manning’s voice</strong>: He’ll make it –</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: But not everyone was so lucky. Two agents
died today. Clay probably won’t survive the night. You’re reckless.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: I knew those men better than you did –</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: Ah, I see. That makes it all alright
then.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: No, it doesn’t make it right, but I stopped
that creature, didn’t I?</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: That’s what you do. That’s why we need you.
You have an insight. You know monsters.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: What are you trying to say?</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: In the end, after you’ve killed and
captured every freak out there – there’s still one left: you.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: I wish I could be more gracious but –</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: Welcome back.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: It’s only for the weekend, Professor Broom.
Then I’ll be on my way –</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: Come and go as you please. Find your way
back. We’ve made quite a few changes –</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: I want that thing locked up, starting now –
Now!!! You hear me??!!</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Nothing’s changed. Home, sweet home.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Liz? Liz!!</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: You!!! You did it, buddy –</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Woo hoo!!</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: A little something I learned in therapy. I’m
depressed – One rubber band. I’m impatient: two rubber bands…</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: I’ll get you a fresh pack.</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: Where do you –</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Shh! Just a second.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Myers, you’re a talker. What’s a good word
– a solid word for “need” –</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: “Need” is a good, solid word.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Nah, sounds too “needy.”</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: Start in, you got nachos coming.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Oh, my God… Look at them all! Who had babies?
C’mere, Tiger…!</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Um… Liz – I – there’s something I’d like
you to – something I need you to hear.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Well. Is it long?? I’m going out, but –</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Out? Out out?</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: For a cup of coffee, but go ahead, read.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: You’re going alone?</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: No. Myers is taking me.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Him!! Why him? Why not me?</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: Hey, your chili’s getting cold –</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Not hungry.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: What did you want me to hear – ?</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: It’s nothing. Just a list – It’s not
finished –</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Oh, okay then. Maybe later then.</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: Anything else you –</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Not from you.</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: Well good n-</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: The subject: Karl Ruprecht Kroenen –</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: Suffered a masochistic compulsion known as
surgical addiction.</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: Both eyelids were surgically removed along
with his upper and lower lips, making speech impossible. The blood in
his veins dried up decades ago. Only dust remains. Four pulverized
vertebrae. A steel rod inserted into his pelvis held him up. What
horrible will power could keep a thing like this alive?</p>
<p><strong>lime</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: What are you two talking about. What’s so
fascinating?? So important??</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: I admire him. He’s a force of nature.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: He’s just pushy.</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: No… He’s determined. Unstoppable –</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Cocky.</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: Strong.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: A brute.</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: My uncle used to say… we like people for
their qualities but love them for their defects.</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: He – loves you.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: What about you?</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Don’t know. Really. I grew up with him. I’ve
missed him too, but now, every time I see him, I get confused. Hardly a
day goes by he’s not in my mind. Even now, I feel he’s here –</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: No cream and sugar, moron. She takes it
black.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Toldya.</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: It’s freezing, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Coffee’s warming me up.</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: What do we do now? Newark, New Jersey,
entertainment capital of the world.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: You offered me a cup of coffee. I’ve got one,
so just sit down.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Hi…</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: You’re Hellboy.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Shh. I’m… on a mission.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Don’t tell anyone, huh?</p>
<p><strong>lime</strong>: Should we send out some scouts?</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: No. Enough. He will never change – always a
child. Always.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: My Mom baked ’em.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: That’s it: she’s laughing. I’m done.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: They don’t look like spies.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Come on! Look at him, those shifty eyes,
that – phony grin…!! You gonna eat that?</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Oh, the yawning trick. That’s so 1950’s!
Watch his arm –</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: We all have a side that we try to hide…</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: Hey! What the hell?</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: SEBASTIAN PLACKBA #16… Moscow.</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: It’s Rasputin’s mausoleum.</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: I see the puppet. But – where is… the puppet
master?</p>
<p><strong>grigory</strong>: Very good, Professor Broom.</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: It was you: The scraps of paper, Liz’s sudden
relapse and return…</p>
<p><strong>grigori</strong>: Bread crumbs on the trail. Like in a fable.
They both distract him and guide him exactly where I need him.</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: Moscow.</p>
<p><strong>grigory</strong>: His destiny.</p>
<p><strong>grigory</strong>: You raised the child. Nurtured him. So, In
return… Would you permit me? A brief, brief glimpse? Of the future –</p>
<p><strong>grigory</strong>: If only you had him destroyed sixty years
ago, none of this would come to pass. But, then, how could you have
known?</p>
<p><strong>grigory</strong>: Your God chooses to remain silent. Mine
lives within me.</p>
<p><strong>grigory</strong>: In the frozen waters of the Malaya Nevka,
in the darkness of the void: every time I died and crossed over, a
little more of the Master came back with me. He disclosed to me the
child’s true name… Would you like to know it??</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: I know what to call him. Nothing you can say
or do will change that. I call him son.</p>
<p><strong>broom</strong>: I am ready.</p>
<p><strong>grigory</strong>: Good. Now, I’ll add two crumbs more: Grief
and revenge…</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Just go down there and tell her how you feel!
My mom says –</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: It’s not that easy, okay? Plus, you’re
nine. You’re not old enough to give me advice.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Who are those guys??</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Something’s wrong –</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Father – I’m back. I’m back. I’m back.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: I wasn’t here. You died alone –</p>
<p><strong>liz’s voice</strong>: He hasn’t spoken to anyone in three
days. Not a word. He doesn’t eat, he doesn’t sleep…</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: I’ve never seen him like this. Never. Should I
stay? With him, I mean?</p>
<p><strong>abe</strong>: Listen – I’m not much of a problem solver…
Three decades and I’ve only gotten two sides. But I know this much: if
there’s trouble – all we have is each other. And I’m stuck here. So –
Take care of the big monkey for me, will you?</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: We’ve collected and destroyed thousands of
eggs. No trace of this “Sammael” or this “Rasputin” character. But we
have this address –</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: Sebastian Plackba #16. Volokolamsk fields,
fifty miles from Moscow. We leave as soon as we get clearance and
equipment –</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: Hellboy’s coming – But I’ll be in charge
this time. Either we wrap this up or I’m closing this freak show for
good.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Hi –</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: I’ve changed my mind. I’ll come to Moscow. If
you – are still going –</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: I am. But – I have something to say, too. I
never had the guts before -</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: But I understand what you don’t like about
me. I do. What I am makes you feel out of place – out there –</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Red, I –</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Listen. I’m not like Myers. He makes you
feel like you belong. And – that’s good. It really is. I – wish I could
do something about this – But I can’t. I can promise you only two
things… One: I’ll always look this good. Two: I won’t give up on you.
Ever.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: I like that…</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>general lapikov</strong>: I have accumulated many objects of
great interest. Preserving our heritage.</p>
<p><strong>general lapikov</strong>: Many – like me – believe Mother
Russia to be very close to a historic rebirth.</p>
<p><strong>grigory</strong>: Rebirth? I like that.</p>
<p><strong>lapikov</strong>: Twenty tons of stone. This thing fell from
the sky into Tungaska forest.</p>
<p><strong>grigory</strong>: June 30th, 1908. It burned hundreds of
square miles of forest. The Romanovs took possession of it immediately.
The Czar guarded it jealously – I have wanted it for ages.</p>
<p><strong>grigory</strong>: Now, finally, it’s mine.</p>
<p><strong>general lapikov</strong>: You are aware, of course, there’s
no way you’ll get it out of Russian territory.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: He is aware.</p>
<p><strong>general lapikov</strong>: It’s a pleasure doing business with
you. Perhaps you have other interests.</p>
<p><strong>grigory</strong>: Enjoy the bright metal you’ve earned. There
will be no further transactions. Only closure.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: “One falls, two shall arise.” So: you pop
one, two come out. You kill two, you get four. You kill four, you’re in
trouble. We have to nail ’em all at once. And the eggs.</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: When we do: No mumbo-jumbo. Double- core
Vulcan-65 grenades.</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: We’ve installed a very handy timer. Set it,
walk away. Cable pulls the safety pins, K-boom! Easy to clean, easy to
use…</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Those things never work. Never.</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: Each of us gets a belt.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: I won’t take ’em. They never work.</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: I’ll carry his –</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Boy Scout.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Sparky to Big Red…</p>
<p><strong>hellboy’s voice</strong>: Sparky?? Who came up with that?
Myers?</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: We’re almost there.</p>
<p><strong>liz’s voice</strong>: We’re leaving the main road, so hang on
–</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: This better be the place or I’ll puke.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Come out and see.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Sebastian Plackba #16…</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: Forget it. This is practically a city. And
it stinks, and it’s muddy. We’ll go back, check into a hotel, regroup
after breakfast. We’ll have to make a grid, go by quadrants. Maybe
satellite photography.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Let me ask for directions.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Animam edere, animus corpus…</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Sixty feet further, comrades, and three
rows in…</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: This here is Ivan Klimentovich: Say “hi”
Ivan.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: We’ll be alright… as long as we don’t
separate –</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Okay, someone’s expecting us. Turn on your
locators – Anyone sees anything…</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Marco…</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: …Polo.</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: Are you sure about this?</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: On a scale of one to ten: two. But – –
she’ll take care of you, Myers. She’s a tough one.</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: What’s that –</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: We should go back – you – you could tear
that door apart –</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Don’t move. We –</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: – should go back. Now!</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: No. Don’t –</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: I’m in charge. We go back!</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Son of a –</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: Ouch!!</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Crap. This guy moves like a cockroach –</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Screw that.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: You killed my father –</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Give your soul to God, Your ass is
mine.</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: Well, it’s not that big a fall…</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Oh, no you don’t –</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: You like playing possum, you Nazi pinhead?
Then try playing dead.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: You’d better stay here. I’ll find a way
out. We’ll come back for you.</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: You call that thing a cigar??</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Yup.</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: You never, ever light a cigar that way.</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: Use a wooden match. It preserves the
flavor.</p>
<p><strong>manning</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: My job.</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: So, he thinks that you and I… That’s why he’s
mad at me –</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: But it’s not true, is it?</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: What – ?</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: That you feel that way about me.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: You want to know – Now – ? Here? Red, white,
whatever – Guys are all the same.</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: Watch out. It’s slippery…</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Oh, my God…</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Marco, Marco, Marco… Get your Big Red butt over
here!</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Hang on kid, I’m coming for you!!</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Sorry. Just couldn’t leave you two
alone.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Hit me.</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Hit me – All of my life I’ve run away from it…
Now I want it to happen! Do it.</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: I can’t, I –</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: I know now: I love him. I’ve always loved
him.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Go now.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Liz…</p>
<p><strong>grigory</strong>: “And I looked and beheld an Angel, and in
his hand the key to the bottomless pit…”</p>
<p><strong>grigory</strong>: These were the words I heard as a peasant
boy in Tobolsk. And now, the door – Sent by the Ogdruh Jahad so that
they might at long last enter our world.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: You are the key! The right hand of doom!</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: What did you think it was made for? Open the
locks.</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: Don’t do it!! Don’t do it!!</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Silence!!</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Imagine it: An eden for you and her –</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>grigory</strong>: No? In exchange for her life then, open the
door.</p>
<p><strong>grigory</strong>: As you wish.</p>
<p><strong>grigory</strong>: She’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Noooo! Noooo!!!</p>
<p><strong>grigory</strong>: Her soul awaits on the other side. If you
want her back… Open the door and claim her.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: For her.</p>
<p><strong>grigory</strong>: Names hold the power and nature of things.
Mine for example. Rasputin: “The crossroads.” And crossroads I have
become. Your true name: Anung-un-Rama. Repeat it. Become the key.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Anung-un-Rama…</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: No!! Don’t do it!! Listen to me!!</p>
<p><strong>grigory</strong>: The final seal. Open it!</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: Remember who you are!!!</p>
<p><strong>grigory</strong>: You will never fulfill your destiny. You
will never understand the power inside you.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: I can live with that.</p>
<p><strong>grigory</strong>: Child…</p>
<p><strong>grigory</strong>: Look what you’ve done –</p>
<p><strong>grigory</strong>: You’ve killed me – an insignificant man…
but you have brought forth a God.</p>
<p><strong>grigory</strong>: Behold, my master, Behemoth. Guardian of
thresholds, destroyer of worlds.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Hell will hold no surprises for us.</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Keep her safe. No matter what. I’ll deal
with whatever’s back there.</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: Alone?</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: How big can it be?</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: They never work –</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Ugh – Now, this is gonna hurt –</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: Ouch – It did hurt.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: In the dark – I heard your voice – What – did
you say – ?</p>
<p><strong>hellboy</strong>: “You, on the other side: let her go.
Because for her, for her – I’ll die. I’ll cross over.” “And you’ll be
sorry I did.”</p>
