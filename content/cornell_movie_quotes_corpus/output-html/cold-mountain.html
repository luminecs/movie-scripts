<p><strong>on a black screen</strong>: Credits.</p>
<p><strong>a range of mountains slowly emerges</strong>: shrouded in a
blue mist like a Chinese water color. Below them, close to a small town,
YOUNG MEN, armed with vicious sticks and stripped to the waist, come
charging in a muscular, steaming pack.</p>
<p><strong>swimmer�s voice</strong>: You will be lonely. You will howl
like a dog as you walk alone. You will carry dog shit cupped in your
hands. You will be smeared with dog shit. Your spirit will wane and
dwindle to blue, the colour of despair…</p>
<p><strong>swimmer</strong>: …This is your path. There is no other.
That’s a curse you can use on the Yankee before battle.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: And that works?</p>
<p><strong>swimmer</strong>: You have to say it in Cherokee.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: You said it to me in Cherokee.</p>
<p><strong>swimmer</strong>: So keep your head still.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: Anyway, there won’t be any war. And if there
is, they say it won’t last a week.</p>
<p><strong>confederate and union armies, ranged against each other
on</strong>: THE OUTSKIRTS OF PETERSBURG. Massive wooden barricades in
the shape of crosses, rows of X’s, define the two lines. The Federals
have been laying siege for months. So early and it’s already hot. The
trees are an oasis of green in a world of mud between the two stark and
ugly scars of the trenches.</p>
<p><strong>rourke</strong>: Don’t worry, son. Those Yankee boys keep
store hours. They ain’t open yet.</p>
<p><strong>butcher</strong>: That’s fresh breakfast. Shoot him!</p>
<p><strong>rourke</strong>: I’m not firing, start the damn war off.</p>
<p><strong>rourke</strong>: That’s my rabbit!</p>
<p><strong>then they’re inside the great gash of crater and can’t
get</strong>: OUT AGAIN, arriving at an insurmountable wall of mud.</p>
<p><strong>later</strong>: A BLACK REGIMENT from the Union join the
attack. Bodies falling on bodies as the Federals charge in and pack
their comrades even tighter. The Confederates make a pincer movement
outside the Crater, forcing all the Federals in. It’s Medieval.</p>
<p><strong>later</strong>: The Confederates run after the retreating
Union soldiers, firing, cavalry riding them down. Inman stands, the
boy’s blood all over him, exhausted and appalled. The crater, behind
him, an abattoir of men. The victors are yelling, pumped mad with
adrenaline. Butcher comes alongside Inman.</p>
<p><strong>butcher</strong>: That was something! That’s hell and we’ve
been there! Kicked old Nick’s asshole.</p>
<p><strong>butcher</strong>: You got a charge?</p>
<p><strong>stobrod</strong>: That’s gold in his mouth he got no need
for. We take his boots.</p>
<p><strong>oakley</strong>: I got a few. You saw?</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: I saw.</p>
<p><strong>oakley</strong>: I know you don’t recognise me. I’m Mo
Oakley’s boy. It’s okay. I was thirteen when you all left. Am I going to
die?</p>
<p><strong>oakley</strong>: I’d like to hear some music while I go.</p>
<p><strong>stobrod</strong>: What about Bonaparte’s Retreat? That’s one
I play.</p>
<p><strong>oakley</strong>: Play me something sweet. Like a girl’s
waiting for me.</p>
<p><strong>oakley</strong>: Play me something like there’s nothing to
fear from a merciful Lord.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: You heard him.</p>
<p><strong>stobrod</strong>: I only know a couple of tunes.</p>
<p><strong>oakley</strong>: Like when you’re thirsty up at Bishop’s
Creek and the water is so cool.</p>
<p><strong>oakley</strong>: I’m reaching Cold Mountain before you.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Don’t get up, soldier. You are mentioned
tonight in my report. You are a credit to the Highlands, to North
Carolina and to the Cause.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: Do you have news, sir, on my application for
transfer?</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: I know. A bloody day. It’s what our General
said: Good thing war is so terrible else a man might end up liking it
too much.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: Sir. It was my understanding the medical
corps was desperate for volunteers.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Right now, soldier, it’s me who is in need
of volunteers. There’s a dozen Yankees in that stand of trees between
us. Stuck there from the retreat. Come daylight they can shoot us down
for sport.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Ada, how are you settling in? Are you liking
the farm?</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Very much. It’s beautiful country.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: So listen – if you would say hello to one of
these fools, I’ll get a field cleared this weekend.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Anyone? Like a forfeit?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: who immediately looks</p>
<p><strong>rourke</strong>: I call this nail: Northern Aggression. I
call this nail: a free nigger.</p>
<p><strong>butcher</strong>: Show some respect – these nails are making
a church.</p>
<p><strong>rourke</strong>: I call this nail: respect the church.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: I’m Ada Monroe.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: I’m Inman.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Inman?</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: W. P. Inman.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: W. P. Inman.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: Repeating a thing doesn’t improve it. People
call me Inman.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: If you were to take a glass of lemonade your
friends might stop staring. Inman.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: They’re not my friends.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: And what do you do?</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: I work wood. Got a piece of land. Mostly work
wood.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Clear fields?</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: I can clear a field.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: So, was there something in particular you
wished to say to me?</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: Not that comes to me. I’ll say thank you for
the lemonade.</p>
<p><strong>rourke</strong>: Esco loves the Yankees.</p>
<p><strong>esco</strong>: I prefer a Yankee to a halfwit.</p>
<p><strong>esco</strong>: What is it you think you’d be fighting
for?</p>
<p><strong>rourke</strong>: The South.</p>
<p><strong>esco</strong>: And what’s that when it’s at home?</p>
<p><strong>acton</strong>: Pop, you causing trouble?</p>
<p><strong>esco</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ellis</strong>: That means yes.</p>
<p><strong>esco</strong>: You cut the wood, you carry the water for good
old King Cotton. Now you want to fight for him. Somebody has to explain
it to me.</p>
<p><strong>acton</strong>: Don’t even try.</p>
<p><strong>butcher</strong>: How’s the lemonade? Sweet?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: That’s a fine looking thing.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: I’ve been missing it.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Thank you, by the way. Inman’s down in the
bottom field, clearing his debt.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Oh dear. And then he had nothing to say.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: He was happy.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Are men so different in Charleston?</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Men? I don’t know. I don’t even know what a
woman should be like. In Charleston I was called a thistle, twice, by
two different men. Both of them – they were hunting for a simile, what
was I like – and thistle came right to them.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: If you’re saying you might like him, why not
go down and say hello.</p>
<p><strong>monroe</strong>: Esco, our friends there – – they helped
build the Chapel?</p>
<p><strong>esco</strong>: That’s Teague and his boys. I’d recommend you
kick them out except a man don’t kick a snake. One time the Teague
family owned the whole of Cold Mountain. My farm, your farm, all
belonged to his grand-daddy. Teague wanted this place bad. You got it.
He’s here sniffing out an advantage.</p>
<p><strong>monroe</strong>: There’s no advantage here, but to celebrate
a job well done. Cheers – – and thank you.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Were you planning to come inside?</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: I’m wetter than a fish.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: There’s a good fire going.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: I’m all right.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Somebody said you were enlisting. Are you?</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: If there’s a war we’ll all fight.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: If there’s a mountain we’ll all climb, if
there’s an ocean we’ll all drown.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: Call a thing a war makes it a challenge to
some men.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Did you get a picture made?</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: Say again.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: A tintype, with your gun and your courage on
display.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: You’re laughing at me.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: I don’t know you.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: You’re always carrying a tray.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: I’m taking a drink over to the negroes in the
barn.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: I’ll do that. I can’t get much wetter.</p>
<p><strong>monroe</strong>: Mr. Inman.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: Reverend.</p>
<p><strong>monroe</strong>: What can I do for you?</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: I have some sheet music. Belonged to my
father. No use to me.</p>
<p><strong>monroe</strong>: You must come in.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: I should probably get along.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Mr. Inman is more comfortable outdoors. Perhaps
we might take a walk.</p>
<p><strong>monroe</strong>: A splendid idea.</p>
<p><strong>monroe</strong>: I want to get sheep into this field. A big
field doesn’t look right without sheep. You’re a lucky fellow,
Mr. Inman, you’ve had this view all your life.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: I think so.</p>
<p><strong>monroe</strong>: It’s a special view. I dragged my poor
daughter to Cold Mountain from Charleston because of my Doctors – they
say my heart is weak – so the air’s meant to do me good. But it’s the
view I think heals.</p>
<p><strong>monroe</strong>: I have to get on my visits. Can I offer you
a ride back into town?</p>
<p><strong>– the whole church is singing, men to one side: women
to</strong>: THE OTHER. Monroe conducts, sings. Inman is there, as is
Ada. He fixes on her neck, the way the hair falls.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Well, you have your war.</p>
<p><strong>teague</strong>: Those who follow Lincoln, or preach
abolition, best keep one eye open when they’re sleeping, Old Bogey Man
might get you!</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: Are you the law all of a sudden?</p>
<p><strong>teague</strong>: That’s right, son. Home Guard for Haywood
County. I’m the law from today. You all go fight now. We’ll watch your
sweethearts.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: You might be safer back in Charleston.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: But then who’ll be waiting for you?</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: I’m going to walk back inside the Chapel.</p>
<p><strong>monroe</strong>: Did you want a quiet word?</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: Just some quiet.</p>
<p><strong>monroe</strong>: Of course Ada.</p>
<p><strong>monroe</strong>: I’ll daresay Dr. O’Brien’ll want to do a
test or two.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: And then there’ll be a coffee or two, a brandy
or two…</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: I found you this book. William Bartram. They
tell me it’s good. I think he writes about these parts, the author,
so…</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: And this… I’m not smiling in it. I don’t know
how to do that, hold a smile, so now I’m solemn…</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: Ada…</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>rourke</strong>: Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: I’m not dying.</p>
<p><strong>stobrod</strong>: What’d he say?</p>
<p><strong>pangle</strong>: Says he ain’t about to die.</p>
<p><strong>stobrod</strong>: Truth to tell they say you are, Soldier.
We’ll meet again, in the better world.</p>
<p><strong>teague</strong>: My condolences to you all. Keep an eye on
the negro. They want what the white man got – all of you watch out your
brave boys give their lives to war and meantime your slaves carry
murder, rape and arson to your firesides.</p>
<p><strong>monroe</strong>: The only slaves within twenty miles labor on
my farm. They’re good Christians and I’ll vouchsafe for them.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>monroe</strong>: You’re looking – at this moment, I don’t
know why – you’re looking exactly like your mother.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Every time you see the doctor you get
melancholy.</p>
<p><strong>monroe</strong>: He listens to my heart and I get
emotional.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: He gives you alcohol and you get emotional.</p>
<p><strong>monroe</strong>: We commiserate about the folly of this
terrible war. Do you worry when there’s no word from him? From
Mr. Inman?</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Yes. But then I’ve tried counting the number of
words which passed between Mr. Inman and me. Is that a bonfire? So close
to the barns.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>monroe</strong>: Hey! Stop there! Hey!</p>
<p><strong>a figure swings in the heat of the flames, hanging from
a</strong>: BEAM. Monroe spies it as he catches up with Ada.</p>
<p><strong>monroe</strong>: Dear God.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: No, Daddy, it’s not real.</p>
<p><strong>monroe</strong>: What is wrong with us all?</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: I’ll get help. Keep away from the flames.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Most of these men will be dead by the
morning or, if they’re stubborn, by nightfall. I have other men outside
in the quadrangle waiting for the beds.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: So, any kind word will be a blessing.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: It’s the heat. I’m sorry. They rot.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Don’t pray. If they’re not God fearing you
can stir up a hornet’s nest.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. morgan</strong>: I’m sorry, you want water?</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: Pigeon River. Little East Fork.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. morgan</strong>: I’m sorry. I don’t know what he’s
saying.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: They ramble. Names of loved ones.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. morgan</strong>: Pigeon River. Is that a place? Cold
Mountain?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: This man is dead.</p>
<p><strong>monroe</strong>: Thank you. For your Providence, Oh lord, we
thank you.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Amen. That was the last of the ham.</p>
<p><strong>monroe</strong>: It was delicious.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: I have to learn how to cook.</p>
<p><strong>monroe</strong>: I was going to say something in Chapel.
Perhaps some of the womenfolk will volunteer.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: I can’t have people coming here and cooking for
me!</p>
<p><strong>monroe</strong>: It’s my fault. I should have raised you less
like a companion and more like a young woman. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: I’m not sorry, but I don’t know how we’ll get
through another winter.</p>
<p><strong>monroe</strong>: Will you play me something? Something
peaceful while I look over my sermon.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Daddy, bring the tablecloth in with you!</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Daddy, come inside before you drown!</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Dear Mr. Inman…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. morgan</strong>: It’s come to you by way of
Virginia.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. morgan</strong>: It’s not too recent – written this past
winter. I’m afraid I can’t read who it’s from. Dear Mr. Inman,</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: – I’m still waiting, as I promised I would, but
I find myself alone and at the end of my wits –</p>
<p><strong>mrs. morgan</strong>: – at the end of my wits, so now I say
to you, plain as I can, come back to me. Come back to me is my request.
Then something I can’t read, something, come back to me.</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: By order of Zebulon Vance, Governor of
this great state of North Carolina: any soldier turned deserter is
guilty of treason and shall be hunted down like a dog.</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: – Any man takes in a deserter is likewise
guilty of treason.</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: The Home Guard is powered to enter any
place it sees fit, without notice or constraint. Names of all deserters
will be posted in every town, published in every newspaper.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Is there a letter for me?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. castlereagh</strong>: Nothing – we’re getting no post
through at all – although if you slip out back the material you ordered
has arrived.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. castlereagh</strong>: If folks knew I was taking
deliveries from the North.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: I know. Thank you so much.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. castlereagh</strong>: The sooner we lose this war the
better. Already one boy gone, another with his leg took off at the knee.
That’s enough.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: What do you hear?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. castlereagh</strong>: All I know is they say not one boy
in ten from these mountains is coming home again and most of them are
deserters.</p>
<p><strong>teague</strong>: It’s taken me too long, but I’ve come to pay
my respects.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>teague</strong>: I reckoned you might need fattening up.</p>
<p><strong>teague</strong>: This house must bring bad luck. Killed my
granddaddy to lose it, then my daddy died on account of not having it,
then your daddy died on account of getting it. We should burn it
down.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Didn’t somebody try?</p>
<p><strong>teague</strong>: Lot to manage without help. Need a hand with
that pump?</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>teague</strong>: I’m happy to volunteer.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: But not to volunteer for the war?</p>
<p><strong>teague</strong>: The war? I wanted to go. But you know: too
old, too literate. Plus I got no spleen. Lost it from a horse’s
kick.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: You’ve got no spleen.</p>
<p><strong>teague</strong>: That’s the thing about an organ. You don’t
know you need it till you lost it. I want to clear this path. I can just
as soon do it and talk as stand around and talk. Then you can say men
beat a path to your door.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: I’d really prefer it if you didn’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>teague</strong>: Would you rather I did my job? See if
there’s any material I should confiscate. For the war effort.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: I was raised in the good manners of the South
where a gentleman doesn’t enter a house with a woman alone.</p>
<p><strong>teague</strong>: Good manners didn’t quite make it to these
mountains. If it don’t yield meat, or you can’t sit on it, or suck on
it… And you’re sleeping all right? These cold dark nights?</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: I’m sleeping fine.</p>
<p><strong>teague</strong>: It’s going to be a long hard winter.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Should I imagine you are dead and, that it is
to your spirit I am writing? No word from you in all this time. If you
receive this please know I am here and warring, too, with a faint
heart.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Ada! Ada, It’s Sally.</p>
<p><strong>esco</strong>: Will you look at the state of this place!</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Poor soul. She’s got nobody and nothing and
three hundred acres of misery.</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: Getting better all the time.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: Seems that way.</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: I wouldn’t hurry. War’s almost done.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: Where’d you take your wound?</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: Before I was born. Never saw a thing in
this world, not a tree a gun or a woman. Though I put my hand on all
three. Couple of things I felt back there I’d sure liked to have had a
long look at.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: What would you give for that? To have your
eyeballs back for ten minutes?</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: Ten minutes! Wouldn’t give an Indian head
cent. I fear it might turn me hateful.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: That’s sure what seeing’s done to me.</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: That ain’t the way I meant it. You said
ten minutes. It’s having a thing and then the loss I’m talking
about.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: Then we don’t agree. There’s not much I
wouldn’t give for ten minutes of someplace.</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: Someplace or someone.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: Same difference.</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: You watch yourself. They’re shooting men
who take themselves a walk.</p>
<p><strong>barber</strong>: Next.</p>
<p><strong>barber</strong>: I’ll cut your hair, but I ain’t about to
shave you. That thing opens up, your head’s liable to falloff.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Ada…</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: You’re skinny as a whippet, girl – you’re
coming indoors with me.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: I can’t. I’m not – I need to clean some
clothes.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Great God, you ever looked at my husband! I
can’t get him to wear decent Church clothes Christmas morning. Hang on
to me, the wind’ll blow you over.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Don’t go back to that dark house. There’s a
bed here, least till our boys get home.</p>
<p><strong>esco</strong>: That your daddy’s coat?</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: I was saying to Sally, I wasn’t expecting to be
visiting, so…</p>
<p><strong>esco</strong>: Don’t suit you.</p>
<p><strong>esco</strong>: I can’t get up to your place this week. She’s
mad at me –</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: I don’t expect -</p>
<p><strong>esco</strong>: – more than I can do to keep this place
half-managed. I’m ready-to stop, I tell you. I just want to sit on my
porch with Sal, watch my boys in the field, holler good job! every hour
or so.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: What about your people in Charleston?</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: There are no people. And no money. My father
had some bonds and investments. They’re worthless now, of course, the
war has… they’re not worth anything. I love it here. In spite of
everything.</p>
<p><strong>esco</strong>: And waiting on a feller.</p>
<p><strong>esco</strong>: Look down our well. She should! Look down our
well with a mirror, you’ll see the future. S’what they say. You do it!
Don’t make that face.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I know it ain’t rightly Christian, but it’s
what folks do, like when they dangle a needle over the belly to see if
you’re carrying a boy or a girl.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: What kind of mirror?</p>
<p><strong>esco</strong>: See anything?</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I tried many a time, never saw a
dickybird.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: You all right?</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Yesterday I found myself crouched over a well
like a mad woman, which I suppose I have become</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: – and staring down into its secrets, I thought
I saw you there, walking back to me –</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: – or wished I did.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: That cow wants milking.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: If that letter ain’t urgent, the cow is – is
what I’m saying.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: I don’t know you.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Old Lady Swanger says you need some help. Here
I am.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: I need help, I need, I do need help, but I need
a laborer – there’s plowing and rough work and – I think there’s been a
misunderstanding.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: What’s the rake for?</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: The rake?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Ain’t for gardening, that’s for sure. Number
one – you got a horse I can plow all day. I’m a worker. Number two
there’s no man better than me cause there’s no man around who ain’t old
or full of mischief. I know your plight.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: My plight?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Am I hard to hear cause you keep repeating
everything. I’m not looking for money, never cared for it and now it
ain’t worth nothing. I expect to board and eat at the same table. I’m
not a servant. Do you get my meaning?</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: You’re not a servant.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: People’ll have to empty their own night jars,
that’s my point.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: And I’m not planning to work while you watch
neither.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Is that a yes or a no?</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: There’s half the day yet. Let’s make a start.
My name’s Ruby. I know your name.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: The rake: there’s a rooster devil, I’m sure of
it. He’s Lucifer himself. I go near him he’s at me with his spurs.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: I despise a flogging rooster. Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Let’s put him in a pot.</p>
<p><strong>men on patrol, a chain gang of prisoners: slaves,
deserters</strong>: IN TOW, A COUPLE OF FEDERAL SOLDIERS. They have
dogs, which sniff and growl, intrigued by the fields, called back by the
Home Guard.</p>
<p><strong>another, then another, then another, all slaves on the
run</strong>: DOTTED AROUND THE FIELD. He walks to the road, paying no
heed to them. They assemble, paying no heed to him and move off in the
opposite direction. Inman turns, looks at them.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: Hey! I’d pay a dollar for an egg. A piece of
cheese.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Ada? Ada? You up?</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Yes. It’s still dark.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Tell the cows that. It’s late.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: I have to eat something.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Then you have to get up earlier. What’s
that?</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: A novel.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: You want to carry a book carry one you can
write in –</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: – we got our own story. Called Black Cove
Farm: a catastrophe.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: I can spell it, too. C-a-t-a-s-t-r-o- phe.
Learned the same place you did, in the schoolroom. That’s one of the
first words they taught me. Ruby Thewes, you are a ca-t-a-s-t-r-o-p-h-
e…</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: You mucking out?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Three years I was in school before my daddy –
saying God rest his soul is like wishing him what he had in life, cause
he lived to rest, he was born tired – before my daddy decided there was
better use for my backside than have it sat all day in front of a
blackboard.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Number One – layout a winter garden for cool
season crops: turnips, onions, cabbage, greens.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Number Two: patch the shingles on the barn
roof. Do we have a maul and froe?</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Maul?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: M-a-u-l.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: I have no idea.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Number three: clay crocks for preserves.
Tomatoes. Beans. Jams.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Clear and turn this field. No harm done
letting it go fallow, now we’ll do well.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Number fifteen</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Sixteen.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Number sixteen: let’s get a martin colony
going in the Gourd House. Keep away crows. You got one thing in
abundance on this farm and that’s crows.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: What’s a Gourd House?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: There’s survival. On them trees. You got a
cider press or would that be wishing on a blessing?</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Actually, yes, I think we do.</p>
<p><strong>inman walks a rocky track, falling away to the river at
one</strong>: SIDE, A STEEP CLIFF TO THE OTHER, the way itself broken
and precarious, bad country to meet an enemy.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: Don’t let go. Just back up, nice and steady,
do this all in reverse, you’re going to end up with her draped back over
your animal.</p>
<p><strong>veasey</strong>: Don’t pull that trigger. I am a man of
God.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: I’ve killed several of them.</p>
<p><strong>veasey</strong>: I mean I am God’s minister.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: What part of God’s business is throwing a
woman down a gorge.</p>
<p><strong>veasey</strong>: A slave woman, can you see that in this
light? She’s black as a bucket of tar.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: Is she dead?</p>
<p><strong>veasey</strong>: Drugged her. Like you would a butterfly. And
I care for her, that’s the heartbreak of it.</p>
<p><strong>veasey</strong>: She’s got my bastard in her belly. What kind
of pistol is that I never saw the like of it?</p>
<p><strong>veasey</strong>: I’m begging you. It’s better you blowout my
brains than return me to this place.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: Where does she live?</p>
<p><strong>veasey</strong>: In our house. She sleeps in our kitchen. You
don’t know me, friend, but the good Lord punished me with want. I am all
appetite. That’s all I do all day is want: food, the female parts…</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: Shut your mouth. I don’t want a sermon every
time I ask a question.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: This your place?</p>
<p><strong>veasey</strong>: Dear God of misery.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: You’re going to put her back where she
sleeps.</p>
<p><strong>veasey</strong>: I do that the Members will lynch me.
Consorting with a nigger, adultery, siring a bastard while serving as
their preacher. We’re a strict congregation we’ve churched men for
picking up a fiddle on the sabbath.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: So you reckoned to kill her.</p>
<p><strong>veasey</strong>: There’s a back door. Have pity.</p>
<p><strong>veasey</strong>: Thank you. I was going to do a grievous
wrong.</p>
<p><strong>vesey</strong>: You tasted dark meat? Sweet as liquorice. I
think I should go back up to my wife. She wakes at the slightest
noise.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: You find me some paper and a pen.</p>
<p><strong>inman has tied a very distraught veasey to a tree in
front</strong>: OF HIS CHAPEL. Inman is pinning a sheet of paper above
Veasey’s head. It’s covered in handwriting. A dog barks.</p>
<p><strong>veasey</strong>: You’re not entitled to judge me! You’re
nothing but an outlier, plain as daylight!</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Morning. Pigs: you have any loose in the
woods?</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: No. What? No. We bought our hams.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: There’s a world more to a hog than the two
hams! Lard, for example, we’ll need plenty –</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: The catastrophe of Ada Monroe’s laundry. I can
feel you shutting your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: What’s this wood?</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: I don’t know. Locust?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Where’s North?</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: North is, North is –</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Name me three herbs growing wild on this
farm.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: I can’t! I can’t! All right? I can talk about
farming in Latin. Will that do? I can read French. I know Harmony and
Counterpoint. I know my Bible. I can name the principal rivers of
Europe, but don’t ask me to name one stream in this county. I can
embroider, but I can’t darn, I can arrange cut flowers, but I can’t grow
them. If a thing has a function, if I might do something with it, it
wasn’t considered suitable.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Ruby, you could ask why? about pretty much
everything to do with me.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: This fence is about the first thing I’ve ever
done that’ll produce an actual result.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: So you never wrapped your legs around this
Inman?</p>
<p><strong>ferrygirl</strong>: For five dollars I wouldn’t give a
parched man a dipper of this riverwater.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: Sign says ferry, five dollars.</p>
<p><strong>ferrygirl</strong>: This look like a ferry? My Daddy’s dead,
or gone off to the Federals, don’t matter which. I’m the way across
now.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: What’s the name of this thing?</p>
<p><strong>ferrygirl</strong>: Nothing but the mighty Cape Fear River,
is all.</p>
<p><strong>ferrygirl</strong>: Nobody crosses this water unless they’re
running from someplace. Some cross one way, some the other: makes no
difference, they’re all running. You want to wait for your friends?</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: I can give you thirty dollars script.</p>
<p><strong>ferrygirl</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Hey! Hey! Wait!</p>
<p><strong>veasey</strong>: Keep going. We’re both in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: No. Get out.</p>
<p><strong>veasey</strong>: It’s Homeguard. Made me tell them all about
you.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: I should have shot you when I had the
chance.</p>
<p><strong>veasey</strong>: I’m not looking for revenge, by the way. For
what you did to me. No, I’m a Pilgrim now, like you, traveling the road,
paying our dues, relying on the kindness of strangers.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: You’re nothing like me and the last thing I
want right now is a conversation.</p>
<p><strong>veasey</strong>: You recall Job in the scriptures? I will
give free utterance to my complaint. I will speak in the bitterness of
my soul. That’s our friend here… They cut off my hair. Which was hard. I
was vain about my hair. I had good curls. But I deserved it. I’m the
Reverend Veasey. Have I seen you in church?</p>
<p><strong>ferrygirl</strong>: I’m saving for a cowhide, and when I get
it I aim to get a saddle made, and when I get me a saddle I’ll save for
a horse, and when I got a horse I’ll throw on the saddle, and then you
won’t see my sorry ass round this swamp again.</p>
<p><strong>veasey</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>ferrygirl</strong>: Catfish. ’gator. Keep your hand in the
boat. Already looks like some critter chewed his neck. Thirty more
dollars, we can go to the cabin. I’ll pull this dress over my head.</p>
<p><strong>veasey</strong>: Have we got thirty dollars?</p>
<p><strong>veasey</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: Jesus, god!</p>
<p><strong>veasey</strong>: I figure that righteous, given our history.
Otherwise I’d bear a grudge on our journey.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: There’s nowhere I’m going with you except to
Hellfire!</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Agricola poetis viam non monstrat.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Which means?</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: The farmer does not point out the road to a
poet.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Which means? Should be the other way round</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Which means, I suppose, which means the poet
should know where he’s going.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: It’s no wonder you’re helpless and hopeless if
it takes this long to fix your hair. Say some more.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Terra mutata non mutat mores. It’s appalling
what’s in my head.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: It’s appalling what’s in my head?</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: No, it means: A change of place does not change
a character.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Well that’s surely true even in English.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: You can keep those earrings.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: We can’t keep anything.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: I have to keep the bangles. They were my
mother’s.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Well that’s all. The rest is for trading. Else
they can bury you in your finery.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: You’re done.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Good God! Okay.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: I like it.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Takes two minutes. That’s what I like.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: How much do you love that piano?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: We’re careful we’ll get through the winter
now. I made old man Roy give me ten of those sheep on account of I said
they were so small put together they were no bigger than six proper
sheep.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: My father always wanted sheep on this land.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: I’m sorry you had to lose your piano. I cut
off my hair once, for money. My daddy got two dollars for it. Made a wig
for a rich feller in Raleigh.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Stobrod called himself a musician – my daddy –
he could play six tune on a fiddle. Got himself shot dead at Petersburg.
I was like his goat or some creature tethered to a post. He left me
once, up the mountains. I was eight. He was gone over two weeks.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Oh Ruby.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: I was all right! He’d walk forty miles for
liquor and not forty inches for kindness.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: And your mother?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Never met her. We’re the same in that regard.
He said she was – he told me a thousand stories – she was a wolf or an
indian or a donkey. Don’t say much for him, except you know he’d be fast
to work up a sweat on a tree if he thought there was pleasure in it.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: There’s cows to milk.</p>
<p><strong>veasey</strong>: Used to be as regular as morning prayers.
Matter of fact I could set my watch by my bowels. That beeswax you fed
me, day before yesterday, it stops a man up. Open my gut now they’d find
turds stacked up like little black twigs.</p>
<p><strong>veasey</strong>: Hey! Look at this! This is a good saw.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: It’s not yours. You take it, you make us
another enemy. You’re a Christian – don’ t you know your
commandments?</p>
<p><strong>veasey</strong>: You’ll find the good Lord very flexible on
the subject of property. We could do a lot with this saw…</p>
<p><strong>veasey</strong>: Why you in such a hurry the whole time?
Hurry or slow the destination is always the same. It’s only the journey
that is different. That’s either in the Good Book or I made it up.</p>
<p><strong>veasey</strong>: Good day to you!</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: My old bull, wandered off and died in this
here creek. Fouled up our water is how I found it.</p>
<p><strong>veasey</strong>: This is a tricky one.</p>
<p><strong>veasey</strong>: The name for the Bull’s member is a tassel.
I learned that and never forgot it.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: Reckon I need a train of mules.</p>
<p><strong>veasey</strong>: I’m getting an idea. My saw is the remedy.
Let’s saw up some wood and make levers.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: Then what?</p>
<p><strong>veasey</strong>: Lever him out. This’ll work!</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: Where you two sports heading?</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: I don’t know where he’s heading. I’m going
down the road. And I got a good way to go before nightfall.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: Charitable of you to make a stop. Ain’t for
me to be curious.</p>
<p><strong>veasey</strong>: How do you work this damn thing?</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: Give me that saw. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: Let’s do this in chapters.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: You might want to leave off that water for a
day or two.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: There’ll be a tang, I’d imagine.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: There’s my place. Hope you can stomach a
yard chock-full of females. Brought my woman home, she showed up with
her three so-called sisters and their brats. The noise in that place is
something awful. It’s why I go hunting.</p>
<p><strong>veasey</strong>: Looks a bit crooked.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: It is on a bit of a tilt. Them females. They
all roll down one end each night!</p>
<p><strong>veasey</strong>: – Roll me over!</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: – In the clover</p>
<p><strong>veasey</strong>: One good fart – that’ll tip over!</p>
<p><strong>veasey</strong>: Oh God of my God! Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>veasey</strong>: The Israelites! The tribes of Israel are
about to flee from the banks of Egypt! Hallelujah!</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: He’s got a shit coming on. It’s overdue.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: And he’s a Preacher? Like a Christian?</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: Like a Christian.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: Good God.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: These two boys is stopping for supper.
They’re on the road to Atonement.</p>
<p><strong>veasey</strong>: Atonement is not a place.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: So what is it when it’s at home?</p>
<p><strong>veasey</strong>: Those are fine examples of the female.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: Take them all and leave the saw. Be a sight
more use.</p>
<p><strong>shyla</strong>: If they want to get in a tub there’s an hour
before food.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: They love to scrub a man. Put the water on
the boil. It’s my liquor, gets their titties swinging.</p>
<p><strong>veasey</strong>: God damn! I was right about sheep droppings
those stools – like rock hard. Quite astonishing.</p>
<p><strong>shyla</strong>: That’s battered flesh. I could work a finger
in there.</p>
<p><strong>veasey</strong>: He’s a hero. Took that wound at
Petersburg.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: He doesn’t know what I am. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>shyla</strong>: He’s shy, ain’t he?</p>
<p><strong>veasey</strong>: Wait up a few minutes, I’ll be in that tub,
then we’ll see who’s a shy one.</p>
<p><strong>shyla</strong>: I want to poke my thumb in his holes.</p>
<p><strong>dolly</strong>: Lila says supper’s up.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: He’s gone now. Look! His eyes have gone.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>veasey</strong>: Dolly?</p>
<p><strong>dolly</strong>: S’me.</p>
<p><strong>veasey</strong>: Dolly, Lila, Shyla and Mae. That’s a poem.
That’s a poem.</p>
<p><strong>veasey</strong>: Dolly, Lila, Shyla and Mae Da-da da-da da-da
dae… …there’s a poem there.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: I’m leaving soon as I’m full.</p>
<p><strong>veasey</strong>: Really. Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: Got a bunch of traps needs visiting. I’ll be
back tomorrow, before dark. You’ll still be here?</p>
<p><strong>veasey</strong>: That’s my fervent prayer.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: My house is your house.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: Like to wash their hands and pray.</p>
<p><strong>veasey</strong>: Say again?</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: Dolly, Lila, Shyla and Mae.</p>
<p><strong>veasey</strong>: That’s Job. Don’t say much but even liquored
up there’s a preacher in him.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: I’ll say my goodbyes, got miles and miles to
go before sunset. I’ll just quickly lie down.</p>
<p><strong>veasey</strong>: I’m heading for that smokehouse and I’m
ready to be washed clean of my dirt.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: You go tend to him. I’ll be seeing you.</p>
<p><strong>dolly</strong>: Come on you – get!</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: He’s mine. You can go rub yourself off on the
Preacher. Gonna make him hug me till I grunt.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: You want to see what Mamma’s got for you?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: That’s good. Ain’t that sweet?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: You just get on and ride me all the way to
China.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: You shy? You need a hand? Let’s have a look
see what we can muster.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: You little bitch! Look at you! Cover
yourself up!</p>
<p><strong>next he swings the shotgun barrel against the side of
inman’s</strong>: HEAD. Inman falls back. Junior goes to the door and
whistles.</p>
<p><strong>on the floor, with dolly astride him, his arm crushing
a</strong>: NAKED MAE INTO AN EMBRACE. He considers Lila, beams:</p>
<p><strong>veasey</strong>: I had a special prayer you’d come visit.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Ada Monroe and Ruby Thewes! Look at you
both!</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Look at us both what?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Like a coupla scarecrows after a
thunderstorm.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: We need a scarecrow, birds eating up half our
winter garden.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Sally’s right. We should both stop toiling and
stand a while with our arms stretch out. I’ll volunteer.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: We got something for you.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: For all your kindness. Coffee. And a pie.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: That’s real coffee. It ain’t hickory and
dirt.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Thank you both. Ruby, I look forward to this.
We all do. Esco and me.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: She made it.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: I made it.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Good God in Heaven.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: I’m still alive.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: We’ll be getting along.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I know Esco’s going to be real sorry he
missed you. You all take care.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: That strike you as odd?</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Stood at her front door?</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Sally?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Number one – I know that woman all my life. I
never stood outside her house – she’d invite a wolf inside if it knocked
on the door.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Perhaps, I don’t know, perhaps she was
busy.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Number two – Old Man Swanger was inside that
house: I could smell his pipe burning. Number three – look at these
fields.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: What about them?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: We came by here a week ago, they were waist
high in hay.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: He’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: This man’s dead!</p>
<p><strong>veasey</strong>: Am I so altered that they don’t see me?</p>
<p><strong>veasey</strong>: I christened that child.</p>
<p><strong>sheffield</strong>: I’m looking to get out of this. They drag
us back to fight – we’re just target practice for the Federal boys.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: You run, we’re all running with you, the lame
and the stupid, of which we number both.</p>
<p><strong>sheffield</strong>: Either way we’re fucked. Run or don’t
run.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: Just give me some warning so I can tell the
guard – I’m not getting shot again for some cause I don’t believe
in.</p>
<p><strong>veasey</strong>: That’s Rebecca. That’s Rebecca. Rebecca!</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Mas?</p>
<p><strong>veasey</strong>: Is it well with you? I’ve been repenting for
what I did. I’ve walked the road of atonement.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Your curls is all gone.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>veasey</strong>: God Bless you.</p>
<p><strong>veasey</strong>: I’m with you. I got a baby coming.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>on the other side of the train the home guard have
remounted</strong>: THEIR HORSES AND ARE RIDING HARD ALONGSIDE IT. Then
they have sight of the escaping prisoners silhouetted at the top of the
bank like a line of paper dolls stretched out along the ridge.
Sheffield’s yelling with adrenaline, Veasey joins in, elated. One of the
guards raises a rifle, steadies himself on his horse, FIRES. He catches
Veasey, who crumples, spinning round and falling down the bank, until
Inman uses all his strength and practically lifts him in the air. The
chain recovers and works back up the bank.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Get these sacks of shit under the ground.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Someone’s been in the corncrib.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: You sure?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: It’s a coon or possum. Scratched out a fist
hole in the side. This place! I’m telling you – we grow, others eat.
I’ll go into town, take the last of the cider and trade for a trap.</p>
<p><strong>teague</strong>: What you looking to catch?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>teague</strong>: With that trap.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: We got some critter stealing our corn.</p>
<p><strong>teague</strong>: Still but the two of you up there, is
it?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: You know it.</p>
<p><strong>teague</strong>: When we get a cold night, camped out, trying
to keep the rule of law, protecting girls like you from Federals and
deserters, that’s a thought warms us ain’t it? – the two of you up there
on my Grand-daddy’s farm, dressed in men’s clothes. Warms us right up.
What you got in the sacks? Looks like human heads! Eh? Looks like a
bunch of heads. We got competition!</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Ruby…</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: I’m not stopping, Sally. I’m not snooping
neither. Just you should know Teague and his boys are lurking down by
Pigeon River, the old mill.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: You tell Ada that was a good pie.</p>
<p><strong>maddy</strong>: Mind that Billy, he’s the jealous kind.</p>
<p><strong>maddy</strong>: Pay no attention to me. What happened to your
head?</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: Fighting.</p>
<p><strong>maddy</strong>: And your neck?</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: Different fighting.</p>
<p><strong>maddy</strong>: You’re the color of a cadaver. I’ll fix you.
I can fix you up.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: Mister – you could fix me I’d be in your
everlasting debt.</p>
<p><strong>maddy</strong>: Debts, fighting – them words don’t mean much
round here. For the record, I’m a female of the species.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: The hat’s a nice touch.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: You’re quiet.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: I cried for my Daddy. I dressed up the
scarecrow in his suit and he came back, his arms out, said you never
cried enough, you never cried enough.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Well now you did.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Then I thought, it’s not my Daddy, it’s my
sweetheart. I saw him once that way, when I looked down Sally’s well. So
I dressed the scarecrow in the dress I wore the day he left. In case his
spirit flies over looking out for me. That looks terrible.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Cabbages.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: I bargained like Lucifer. We can make all
kinds of good eating.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Such as?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Cabbage. Slaw, sauerkraut, cabbage soup, fried
cabbage, stuffed cabbage…</p>
<p><strong>teague</strong>: Afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>esco</strong>: Don’t spread out. Why they spreading out?</p>
<p><strong>teague</strong>: I’m not spreading out. I’m sitting here.</p>
<p><strong>teague</strong>: Never knew a man worked in his field with a
shotgun.</p>
<p><strong>esco</strong>: There’s a war on.</p>
<p><strong>teague</strong>: Got to watch out for the Bogey Man.</p>
<p><strong>esco</strong>: Get off my land.</p>
<p><strong>teague</strong>: Your boys come back.</p>
<p><strong>esco</strong>: Ain’t seen my boys in four years. They’re
fighting other boys, not old men and women.</p>
<p><strong>teague</strong>: He means us. He’s referring there to us. So
you won’t care if we take a look around?</p>
<p><strong>esco</strong>: What I gotta give you? A chicken? A lamb?</p>
<p><strong>teague</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>esco</strong>: Right then.</p>
<p><strong>teague</strong>: Thing is – you got one barrel and there’s
five of us. Not a fair fight.</p>
<p><strong>bosie</strong>: Bogey Man! Bogey Man!</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>esco to the sheet, then spinning him round in the sheet
so</strong>: THAT IT TIGHTENS. A stain grows out from the blade, huge
and spreading. Teague walks to Esco.</p>
<p><strong>teague</strong>: You’re harbouring deserters. I can
confiscate every animal on this farm, every plate, every sheet, every
little pellet of chicken shit – I can confiscate your old lady’s
asshole, so don’t offer me a bird.</p>
<p><strong>teague</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>teague</strong>: You got your bait. Set it on the hook.</p>
<p><strong>under his stomping feet, the rail post is pressed on
sally</strong>: SWANGER’S THUMBS. She can’t scream any longer, because
the noose has practically strangled her. The rope’s tied off to Bosie’s
horse, which yanks on the noose with every slight movement. Sally is
prostrate in the dirt.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: I can’t get this damn thing off her.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Dear Lord in heaven.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Ada, I can’t get this off her!</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: What darling? What?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: She’s saying don’t bother.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Wait!</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: There’s someone down there. I think it’s
Esco.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: This world won’t stand long. God won’t let it
stand this way long.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: How long have I been sleeping?</p>
<p><strong>maddy</strong>: Not long enough.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: I can’t stop here. I’m a deserter. They find
me here things could be bad for you.</p>
<p><strong>maddy</strong>: What they going to do? Cut short my young
life? Sit down before you fall down.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: How long you been up here?</p>
<p><strong>maddy</strong>: What year are we? ’63?</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: Last time I checked it was ’64.</p>
<p><strong>maddy</strong>: I’d say twenty six years.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: Twenty six years!</p>
<p><strong>maddy</strong>: I could move on anytime. I’ve seen most of
the world anyway, Richmond in the North, south almost to Charleston.
You’re going somewhere or you are somewhere, what’s the difference?</p>
<p><strong>maddy</strong>: I’ve learned a person can survive off pretty
much of a goat. I can’t abide a chicken, but a goat gives you company
and milk and cheese and then, when you need it, good meat.</p>
<p><strong>maddy</strong>: So you’ve been fighting?</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: I could be at killing for days sometimes, in
the hand to hand, my feet against the feet of my enemy and I always
killed him and he never killed me.</p>
<p><strong>maddy</strong>: He gave it a try, to look at you.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: I guess he did.</p>
<p><strong>maddy</strong>: See I think there’s a plan. There’s a design.
For each and every one of us.</p>
<p><strong>maddy</strong>: You look at nature, a bird flies somewhere,
picks up a seed, shits the seed out, a plant grows. Bird’s got a job,
seed’s got a job.</p>
<p><strong>inman is eating like a man possessed, wrapping the meat
in</strong>: CORN FRITTERS AND PUSHING THEM INTO HIS MOUTH. Maddy
watches him, adds another mound of meat to his plate. Inman nods in
thanks, but – doesn’t look up.</p>
<p><strong>maddy</strong>: Take one of these now with your food.</p>
<p><strong>maddy</strong>: Swallow it. If you die I’ll give you your
money back.</p>
<p><strong>maddy</strong>: Our minds aren’t made to hold on to the
particulars of pain, the way we do bliss.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: It’s true…</p>
<p><strong>maddy</strong>: What is?</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: What you remember.</p>
<p><strong>maddy</strong>: What’s her name?</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: Ada. – Sometimes I think I’m crazy when I’m
just hungry – Ada Monroe.</p>
<p><strong>maddy</strong>: And is she waiting for you?</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: She was. I don’t know. Or if she’d know me.
I’m like the boy who goes out in winter for firewood comes back in the
spring with a whistle.</p>
<p><strong>maddy</strong>: Now drink this. It visits the pain. And
you’ll sleep.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: I’ve had to put myself in the way of people’s
kindness.</p>
<p><strong>maddy</strong>: I hope you found it.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: The passenger pigeons fly south, the berries
ripen. Whether I see them or not, whether a man dies, or a war is
won.</p>
<p><strong>maddy</strong>: That’s the laudanum getting to you. That’s
good. Say something more. Raise that up for me.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: She gave me a book. Ada Monroe. Man by the
name of Bartram. Wrote about his travels. I carried that book through
every battle. I left it someplace, got to get it back. Sometimes just
reading the name of a place near home – Sorell Cove, Fire Scale Ridge –
was enough to bring me to tears. Thing is I’ve been thinking – those
places belonged to people before us, to the Indian – and he had a
different name. What did he call Sorell Cove? How can a name not even
the real name break your heart? It’s her, she’s the place I’m heading.
And I hardly know her. So how can a person who’s maybe not even a real
person – I don’t know what I’m talking about – I have to close my
eyes…</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: It’s a man.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: What is?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Raiding our corn. Got him in the trap. That’s
him yelping.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: You’re not going to shoot him!</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: I don’t want him to shoot me. Can you fire
this thing?</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Listen up – you got a barrel trained on your
rear-end.</p>
<p><strong>stobrod</strong>: Get me out of this dang thing. My fist’s
about to drop off.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: You got a weapon?</p>
<p><strong>stobrod</strong>: No ma’am. I’m begging you. I’m already on
my knees, otherwise I’d get down on them.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Unbelievable! Stobrod Thewes.</p>
<p><strong>stobrod</strong>: Ruby? God damn!</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: That’s my daddy…</p>
<p><strong>stobrod</strong>: Just so’s you know – I can eat while she’s
doing this – in case you’re holding off.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Just so’s you know – you’re not eating inside.
Number One – they hang people round here for taking in deserters. Number
two – even if they gave out prizes – you’d still eat outside.</p>
<p><strong>stobrod</strong>: You’re scarred.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: I’m what?</p>
<p><strong>stobrod</strong>: Your heart. Scarred. I did wrong to
you.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: You’d be scarred. You’d be really scarred if I
hadn’t wrapped them trap teeth in sacking. Which was her idea.</p>
<p><strong>stobrod</strong>: I hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Good God!</p>
<p><strong>stobrod</strong>: I wrote fifty tunes with you in mind. Ruby
this, Ruby that, Ruby with the eyes that sparkle.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Hey! Let’s agree: you beat me, you abandoned
me, you ignored me, you beat me some more – all of that is better than
Ruby with the eyes that sparkle!</p>
<p><strong>stobrod</strong>: I’m changed. People change. War changes
people something terrible. Ruby’s told you – I’ve no doubt – I wasn’t
always the best…</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: You were an asshole.</p>
<p><strong>stobrod</strong>: I can’t disagree with that. I was.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Get him out of here!</p>
<p><strong>stobrod</strong>: Music’s changed me. I’m full of music,
darling. I wish I’d brung my fiddle Hey Ruby! Got a new fiddle – it’s
got a little snake’s rattle in the body – took it off a dead federal in
Virginia. That’s a beautiful fiddle. It’s full of tunes, Ruby. Don’t
know if it’s from that little rattle locked up in it, or from something
untied my heart.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: You’re all set.</p>
<p><strong>stobrod</strong>: Bless you both.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Ain’t you got a proper coat?</p>
<p><strong>stobrod</strong>: Darling, I’m fine. And you just say the
word, I won’t come back neither. I don’t want to put either you or your
mistress here in any bother.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: I’m not Ruby’s employer.</p>
<p><strong>stobrod</strong>: Oh, okay, who is?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Nobody. I’ll make up food for you, you come
Sundays before it’s light, I’ll leave it behind the Old Frazier
Mill.</p>
<p><strong>stobrod</strong>: Do you know who really needs a coat,
darling, is my partner, fat boy name of Pangle. We’re hiding up in the
caves and he feels the cold like a thin man, but ain’t no coat’ll fit
him. I love you, Ruby. In case the sky falls on our head. You’re a good
girl.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: He is so full of manure, that man, we could
lay him on the dirt and grow another one just like him.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: So that’s Stobrod Thewes.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: It is and that’s the last you’ll see of
him.</p>
<p><strong>maddy</strong>: That’s medicine and goatmeat. You’re sick of
both.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: I have a deal to thank you for.</p>
<p><strong>maddy</strong>: And that’s just for show, or – if you can get
close enough – a wild turkey.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Get on back where you came from!</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: My love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal
rocks beneath</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: – a source of little visible delight, But
necessary.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: She ain’t gonna marry Linton, is she? She said
– whatever our souls are made of his and mine are the same. You can’t
say that and then marry Linton.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: We’ll find out.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: I’m not waiting until tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Ruby, I’m falling asleep.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Little visible delight, but necessary. I like
that…</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: I’m one man alone. I’m a Confederate soldier
on furlough. I have no bad intention. I need shelter and food.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: Can I at least sleep in the corn crib – just
for some shelter? I’ll be on my way come morning.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: I’ve got a rifle.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: Fair enough.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: There’s some beans and corn pone, all I got.
You better come in.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: I’m alone here, as you can see, with my baby.
I need to believe you mean no harm.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: No, I mean to give it to you.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: I don’t want it. I had my way they’d take
metal altogether out of this world. Every blade, every gun.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: Is your baby sick?</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: He cries. I don’t know. He cries a lot. My man
is dead. He took his wound at Fredericksburg. Never saw his boy.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: It’s pretty much what you’ll get if you knock
on any door of this war. Man dead, woman left.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: It’s mean food but it’s hot.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: There’s no hunting on the road, just cress
and –</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: I need to feed this man, if you could look
away.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Used to have a cow, few goats. Raiders took
them. Made me kill our own dog on the porch. That poor creature watched
over me. Nothing left now save a hog and couple of chickens to live off
till spring. I’ll have to kill that hog and make sense of the flesh and
divisions which is something I never did.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: I could do that for you in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: I’m not asking.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: It’s what I’d gladly do for you for what
you’re gladly doing for me. I’m Inman by the way. That’s my name.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: I’m Sara. My baby’s Ethan.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: Glad to know you both.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: You look about his size. He was another man
straight up and down.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: I don’t even have a blanket.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: I got a blanket.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: I’ll leave you the lamp.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: They fit?</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: Pretty much. These boots are good boots.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: I’ll say good night.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Will you come inside?</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Could you do something for me? Do you think
you could lie here, next to me, and not need to go further?</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: I don’t know. I’ll try.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: I’ll go. I’ll go, shall I?</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: I don’t want you to.</p>
<p><strong>pangle</strong>: She don’t speak.</p>
<p><strong>stobrod</strong>: She can’t speak. I told you.</p>
<p><strong>pangle</strong>: Is she feeble then?</p>
<p><strong>stobrod</strong>: No. Don’t mind him. Hey Ruby: what about
this?</p>
<p><strong>stobrod</strong>: Don’t make that face – you listen: c’mon
Georgia…</p>
<p><strong>georgia</strong>: There’s snow in the air.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Don’t sleep here.</p>
<p><strong>stobrod</strong>: We won’t.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: It’s bitter, they could stop one night.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: They stop one night, they’ll want to stop
two.</p>
<p><strong>pangle</strong>: This coat’s warm.</p>
<p><strong>stobrod</strong>: What about next Sunday? That’ll be the New
Year. It’s gonna be a better one.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>georgia</strong>: The war’s over in a month.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: He said that a month ago.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: It started off being over in a month.</p>
<p><strong>stobrod</strong>: Miss Ada. Merry Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Merry Christmas. Pangle. Georgia.</p>
<p><strong>georgia</strong>: ’Night.</p>
<p><strong>pangle</strong>: ’Night now.</p>
<p><strong>stobrod</strong>: That’s my Ruby.</p>
<p><strong>georgia</strong>: She’s an original.</p>
<p><strong>stobrod</strong>: You think the Good Lord would forgive an
old cold fool if he changed his mind? Ada said it herself it was
bitter…</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: What kind of name’s Georgia?</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: It’s where he comes from, it’s not his
name.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: I know that’s meant to be the ugliest state
under the heavens.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Why do you care what his name is?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: What’s that cluster of Stars?</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Orion.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: What about them shaped like a wishbone?</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: That’s Taurus the bull, and that’s Gemini and
that’s Orion’s big dog, Canis Major.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Listen to her, Sal. She’s turned into a
highland girl.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: I could always name the stars, Ruby, that was
never my problem.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: I love you darling. In case that big old sky
falls on our heads. And I love you, too. Sal.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: It’s sad, Sal. It’s a c-a-t-a-s-t-r-
o-p-h-e.</p>
<p><strong>stobrod</strong>: No sense setting off in snow.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Get out of here, quick!</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Federals are coming. They find you here it’ll
go bad on all of us.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: I can try and fight them.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: No, my baby. Please no! Just get.</p>
<p><strong>pistol</strong>: We got all day.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: My baby’s sick! Cover him up! He’s shaking!
Have some pity.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: I got nothing. I swear.</p>
<p><strong>nym</strong>: That ain’t necessarily so.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Yes! Take me inside! Let’s all go inside! Take
my baby inside and then we’ll do whatever you want.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: There’s nothing! You take that hog I’m as good
as dead. Cover up my boy!</p>
<p><strong>bardolph</strong>: This is ready to get a fit going. It’s
shuddering. It’s gone blue.</p>
<p><strong>pistol</strong>: How long does he want? Hey! Leave some for
the rest of us.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: Move away from the baby.</p>
<p><strong>bardolph</strong>: Don’t shoot.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: Take off your boots. Take off your pants, and
your shirt.</p>
<p><strong>bardolph</strong>: Don’t shoot me, please. We’re starving. We
haven’t eaten.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: You’d better get running before you catch
your death of cold.</p>
<p><strong>bardolph</strong>: Thanks, thank you. I will.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Good?</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Do you think he’s dead?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: This snow. Isn’t it supposed to fall with bad
news?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Bad news is girls get working. I’m going to
round up the animals. This’ll settle.</p>
<p><strong>georgia</strong>: What d’you reckon? Think we could eat
this?</p>
<p><strong>stobrod</strong>: You cook something long enough you can eat
anything.</p>
<p><strong>pangle</strong>: It’s frozen. How long it been there for?</p>
<p><strong>stobrod</strong>: You hungry?</p>
<p><strong>pangle</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>stobrod</strong>: Not very long.</p>
<p><strong>stobrod sings and cooks. pangle accompanies him on
banjo,</strong>: Georgia joins in the chorus. Stobrod pulls one of the
hickory stick skewers out of the fire, blows on the, meat, smells,
smells again, looks at Georgia, takes a bite. Chews.</p>
<p><strong>stobrod</strong>: Edible.</p>
<p><strong>pangle</strong>: Ow!</p>
<p><strong>georgia</strong>: Don’t taste much like venison.</p>
<p><strong>pangle</strong>: It’s good. I think it’s good.</p>
<p><strong>teague</strong>: Evening. Hope we didn’t disturb you.</p>
<p><strong>stobrod</strong>: You’re all right.</p>
<p><strong>teague</strong>: Name’s Teague. Do I know you?</p>
<p><strong>stobrod</strong>: Thewes.</p>
<p><strong>teague</strong>: You a deserter? – don’t mind if I just warm
up at your fire. That your wife?</p>
<p><strong>stobrod</strong>: Who? That’s a he!</p>
<p><strong>teague</strong>: He your wife?</p>
<p><strong>stobrod</strong>: We’re musicians. He picks the banjo, I got
a fiddle.</p>
<p><strong>teague</strong>: Look pretty romantic by the fire. Don’t
they? Your boyfriend’s got a nice bit of flesh on him. Close your eyes
slip inside that shirt get two good handfuls – dark enough I’d be
willing. I’m just kidding. Tell him, I’m just kidding.</p>
<p><strong>bosie</strong>: He’s just kidding.</p>
<p><strong>teague</strong>: Did you answer my question – about your
military status?</p>
<p><strong>stobrod</strong>: Discharged. Took a wound at Petersburg.</p>
<p><strong>teague</strong>: Oh, so like a hero’s discharge.</p>
<p><strong>stobrod</strong>: I guess.</p>
<p><strong>teague</strong>: And your boyfriend?</p>
<p><strong>stobrod</strong>: The military wouldn’t take him. He can’t
fight. He’s simple. He’s got a mind no bigger’n a pickled walnut.</p>
<p><strong>teague</strong>: I’m sorry – he’s fat, he’s simple and got
titties – but you’re insisting he ain’t a woman. God damn! Don’t that
sausage smell outstanding.</p>
<p><strong>stobrod</strong>: Miqhty outstanding.</p>
<p><strong>teague</strong>: Mighty outstanding! There’s a new phrase.
Mighty outstanding. Listen, don’t tell me – you left your papers
somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>stobrod</strong>: Which papers?</p>
<p><strong>teague</strong>: Your hero’s discharge. For mighty
outstanding valour.</p>
<p><strong>stobrod</strong>: They’re, they’re, they’re at my house.</p>
<p><strong>teague</strong>: And where, where, where is your house?</p>
<p><strong>stobrod</strong>: Down the mountain.</p>
<p><strong>teague</strong>: But you’re up the mountain.</p>
<p><strong>stobrod</strong>: Hunting. Drinking.</p>
<p><strong>teague</strong>: On honeymoon. I’m pretty fucking funny
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>bosie</strong>: Is he going to play? You gonna play that
fiddle?</p>
<p><strong>stobrod</strong>: Sure. Sure. Hey, wake up!</p>
<p><strong>teague</strong>: Evening, Mrs.</p>
<p><strong>pangle</strong>: Where’s Georgia?</p>
<p><strong>teague</strong>: Where’s Georgia?</p>
<p><strong>stobrod</strong>: He don’t know what he’s saying. We were
talking about Georgia early on – maybe heading down there.</p>
<p><strong>teague</strong>: Georgia’s like my armpit. Worse, it’s like
yours. Want some sausage?</p>
<p><strong>pangle</strong>: Thanks. You is Home Guard?</p>
<p><strong>teague</strong>: Yes, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>pangle</strong>: You is Teague?</p>
<p><strong>teague</strong>: I’m known!</p>
<p><strong>stobrod</strong>: He don’t know what he’s saying.</p>
<p><strong>pangle</strong>: That bastard Teague.</p>
<p><strong>teague</strong>: Really.</p>
<p><strong>pangle</strong>: Bad words. Folk always put the curse words
in front of your name.</p>
<p><strong>stobrod</strong>: Mr. Teague wants us to play.</p>
<p><strong>pangle</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>teague</strong>: We heard there were deserters in these
parts. Hiding out in a big cave.</p>
<p><strong>stobrod</strong>: Not come to my ears.</p>
<p><strong>teague</strong>: You don’t know where this cave is?</p>
<p><strong>stobrod</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>pangle</strong>: You do, Stobes! He means –</p>
<p><strong>stobrod</strong>: Right, right! he means, there is a cave,
right, it’s up over the other side, big cave, we played some music up
there, never occurred to me they were deserters. Near Bearpen
Branch.</p>
<p><strong>pangle</strong>: Ain’t nowhere near Bearpen Branch! It’s this
side! He’s always getting lost. That cave – we live there! – it’s over
on Big Stomp. Tell you how I always find it. There’s a big old locust
tree fell down across the path, that points straight at it, like a
finger, always a dozen squirrels round that tree. You gets to the tree,
sit on it, and there’s your entrance, straight in front of you, tree
points at it. Come right to your hand, them squirrels – – Chrrrpppp!
Chrrrrppp!</p>
<p><strong>teague</strong>: Sounds good. Okay, let’s eat, let’s hear
some music.</p>
<p><strong>stobrod</strong>: I call this tune: Ruby’s Lament.</p>
<p><strong>pangle</strong>: What’d you make of that?</p>
<p><strong>bosie</strong>: Heartbreaking.</p>
<p><strong>teague</strong>: Stand over by that tree.</p>
<p><strong>stobrod</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>teague</strong>: Over by that tree. Over there. Take your
boyfriend.</p>
<p><strong>stobrod</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>teague</strong>: Don’t smile.</p>
<p><strong>pangle</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>teague</strong>: Quit smiling.</p>
<p><strong>stobrod</strong>: He always smiles. He don’t mean nothing by
it. I told him this world’s got nothing worth a smile.</p>
<p><strong>teague</strong>: Put your hat over your face.</p>
<p><strong>pangle</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>teague</strong>: Cover your face with your hat.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: I told Georgia he can stop here, sleep in the
barn. He’s got nothing inside him. He’d walk out of here and die in the
snow.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: He can milk the cows. I was worrying about
that. It’ll be dark in a couple of hours. I’s ten hours climb from here.
He’s drawn a map.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: You know these fools stayed the night in the
Mill? That’s Stobrod – he can’t do one good thing without adding the
bad. Left tracks in the snow all the way up for them Home Guards to
follow. That’s a sign says shoot me!</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Ruby, I’m so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: We should get going.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Every piece of this is a man’s bullshit. They
call this a war a cloud over the land, but they made the weather. Then
they stand in the rain and say: shit! It’s raining! If I cry one tear
for my Daddy I stole it off a crocodile.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Maybe Teague’s took him. They did that with
the Swanger boys – didn’t, they? – dragged them into town, then strung
them up as warning… it’s snowed since, so I can’t read the story on the
ground.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Let’s dig.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Ruby! Ruby!</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: He’s still breathing! God damn! Daddy; Daddy –
it’s Ruby. Don’t you die on me again. He’s still breathing!</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Pack a pan full of snow. I need good clean
water, boiled up.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Let’s get him home. We have herbs there and
it’s warm.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: He’ll die first. He’s got hardly no blood left
in him.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: He’ll die lying here.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: There’s a place further on up. Used to be. Old
Cherokee place. There’s good water right by it.</p>
<p><strong>the two women emerge from a steep tunnel of trees in
a</strong>: CHESTNUT GROVE. There’s a stream and, up on the bank, A
CLUSTER OF BLACK CONICAL HUTS, made up of chestnut logs, abandoned and
slightly sinister looking. They approach one of the huts, its door long
lost. The snow has drifted in. A second hut has a door which they pry
open. It’s dark and cold, but apparently still weatherproof. They get
Stobrod off the horse and carry him inside, then come out again to
unload the horse of its remaining load.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: This horse is weary. He’s ready to give up the
ghost.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Good boy. That’s warmer, isn’t it.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: I’m getting firewood.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: That wood – that sound when it burns that mean
more snow?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Yes, it do, country girl.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Turn round and go back where you came from.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: Ada? Ada Monroe?</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: I do not know you.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: Then I believe I made a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: If I knew where to go I’d go there.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Inman?</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: You’d better come with me.</p>
<p><strong>very high angle</strong>: Inman walks towards Ada. They
embrace.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Ruby, this is Inman.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Congratulations, I should send you out with a
shotgun more often. He looks as he needs sleep.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: I may need to.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Be my guest. You shot or something?</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: Not lately.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Hungry? He woke up.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Stobrod?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Said – your mommy’s name was Grace then closed
his eyes again.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: He’s asleep. They both are.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: I’m not surprised. Your man looks played
out.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: I saw him. I realize now.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Saw him when?</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: In Sally Swanger’s well. A tunnel of trees. The
man like a black smudge in the snow, the sun behind him.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Well there you are.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Funny thing is it wasn’t the same. The image.
It wasn’t snowing. And in the well, he was, as if he were falling.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: You probably don’t remember it right.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: I remember it exactly. There were crows, these
black crows flying towards me. I thought I was seeing him fall. Instead
I was seeing him come back to me. All this while I’ve been packing ice
around my heart. How will I make it melt?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Better get a fire going. I’ve got big plans
for that farm. Got a vision in my mind of how that Cove needs to be.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: I know you have.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: There’s not a thing we can’t do ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: I’m sorry. I was trying to be quiet.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: I couldn’t sleep.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: – I got no appetite left to be in a room with
wounded men.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: I can’t see your face.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: It’s not a face you recognised.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Did you get my letters?</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: I got three letters. Carried them in that
book you gave me. The Bertram.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: I must have sent 100. Did you write to me?</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: Whenever I could. If you never got them I can
summarize.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: No, it’s –</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: I pray you’re well. I pray I’m in your
thoughts. You are all that keeps me from sliding into some dark
place.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: But how did I keep you? We barely knew each
other. A few moments.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: A thousand moments. They’re like a bag of
tiny diamonds glittering in a black heart. Don’t matter if they’re real
or things I made up. The shape of your neck. The way you felt under my
hands when I pulled you to me.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Your boots, one polished, one not yet
polished.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: You’re playing a piano and I’m standing
outside.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: I’m playing a piano and you’re standing
outside.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: That kiss – which I’ve kissed again every day
of my walking.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Every day of my waiting.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: Maybe you can’t see my face, but if you could
see my inside, my whatever you want to name it, my spirit, that’s the
fear I have deeper than any gash on my neck. I think I’m ruined. They
kept trying to put me in the ground, but I wasn’t ready, no ma’am, no
more ready than that scoundrel in there’s not ready to die on us. But if
I had goodness, I lost it. If I had anything tender in me I shot it
dead.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Number one – shut this door, it’s freezing.
Number two – shut that door, it’s freezing. I’m laying on my back, with
my fingers poked in my ears trying to shut out who’s got a bag of
diamonds and who’s got boots needs polishing, If you want to get three
feet up a bull’s ass listen to what sweethearts whisper to each
other.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: In fact, if you’re going to wimble all night
I’m going to sleep in with him.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Now I can’t see anything.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: I’ll say goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: I don’t think Ruby’s vacating my hut so that
you can sleep in a different one.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Whatever comes to pass between you and me, I
want Ruby to stay in Black Cove.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: As long as she wants. And if she never leaves
I’ll be glad.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: More a question could she put up with me.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: And you understand she’s my friend, she’s not a
hired hand and she doesn’t empty a night jar unless it’s her own.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: This war’s made some things pointless. It’s
hard to imagine a wedding. I think even my father would recognize
that.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: Ada, I want to marry you. If you’ll have
me.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Isn’t there’s some religion where you just have
to say I marry you, three times, and then you’re man and wife.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: I marry you. I marry you. I marry you.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: Why’s that funny?</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: No, I think it’s I divorce you three times and
then you’re not married anymore.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: I can wait for you.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: You waited enough. I certainly did. I marry
you. I marry you. I marry you.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: I’m sorry about the way I look. In these
clothes. And there are so many buttons. Will you turn your back?</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: Not for all the gold dollars in the Federal
Bank.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: You go ahead. I’ll follow with the horse at a
pace your daddy can tolerate.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: We can all go together.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: It’s safer this way. No one has quarrel with
you.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: He’s right.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: I gather I need permission if I reckon on
living at Black Cove.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: We’ll get to you by nightfall.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: You be safe.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: Your Mr. Bartram speaks about some category
of fly born on the hide of a cow. It flies up into a tree and waits and
waits until it smells cow. It can wait a year, two years, I don’t know,
maybe longer. Then a cow comes along and it wakes up, flies down, lays
its eggs on the cow. There’s purpose for you.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: And am I the fly in this story, or the cow?</p>
<p><strong>stobrod</strong>: You come up the mountain for me, darling,
I’d be dead otherwise, dead and gone.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: You’d have found some other fool to rescue
you.</p>
<p><strong>stobrod</strong>: He’s sweet on you, that Georgia boy.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: If you say a thing and then cough it’s a lie.
Daddy, stay on that horse, and don’t lose him or sell him. We’ll need
him on the farm.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: I hope that Georgia boy’s been seeing to the
animals.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: I thought you were thinking on him!</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: I was not. I was thinking on swollen udders –
and before you say same difference…</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: I’m saying nothing.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Miss lovey-dovey!</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: Don’t look round.</p>
<p><strong>stobrod</strong>: Got it.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: How many men does he have?</p>
<p><strong>stobrod</strong>: There were five. You can’t reason with that
man.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: I got a conversation stopper. Closer we get
to that broken ground the better.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: You hold on tight, do you hear? When I say
three, look round, nice and slow.</p>
<p><strong>stobrod</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: One, two, three.</p>
<p><strong>litter with a couple more, souvenirs of their cave
visit.</strong>: Teague waves.</p>
<p><strong>teague</strong>: God damn! You’re a hard fucker to put down.
Good directions to that cave from the fat boy – saw the squirrels, sat
on the tree made some friends, brought some back with me.</p>
<p><strong>shot knocks jo from his horse, the second mo, who falls
into</strong>: THE SNOW, BLEEDING FROM THE GROIN AND SCREAMING. The
riderless horse gets tangled up with the others.</p>
<p><strong>rides away, evidently not relishing the fight, and
throws</strong>: HIMSELF AT TEAGUE, WHOSE HORSE IS BUCKING WILDLY.
Teague’s carbine fires an involuntary shot into the air. Inman yanks the
gun from his hand with his own left hand and lets go the shotgun barrel
of the Lemats with the other, the big pistol almost leaping from his
hand with the recoil. TEAGUE’S CHEST OPENS OUT AS HE’S THROWN OFF THE
HORSE. Mo is still screaming.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: Come out of there.</p>
<p><strong>bosie</strong>: No, sir. Here’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: I just have to shoot the horse from under
you.</p>
<p><strong>bosie</strong>: Shoot her. She’s not mine. You riding Mr
Teague’s mare?</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: I am.</p>
<p><strong>bosie</strong>: He dead?</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: I hope so. Look, how old are you? Give me
your gun and ride home, I’m done fighting. I’m sick of it.</p>
<p><strong>bosie</strong>: I give you my gun you’ll shoot me dead.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: I will not shoot you, but nor am I walking
down that mountain looking over my shoulder for you.</p>
<p><strong>bosie</strong>: That’s what they call a conundrum. I tell you
what I’ve got on my side.</p>
<p><strong>inman</strong>: What have you got on your side?</p>
<p><strong>bosie</strong>: The confidence of youth.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: You bring that lamb outside.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: What are you doing!</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: He came out dead, love.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Don’t kill him!</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: I’m not going to kill him. But we have to try
something or else he’s going to die.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Isn’t that a small mercy.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Hot hot hot hot hot!!!</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Grace Inman, nobody said eat. Mr. Thewes…</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: For good friends, good food, good family: for
all our blessings – Oh Lord we thank thee. Amen.</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: Amen !</p>
