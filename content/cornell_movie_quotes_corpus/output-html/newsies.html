<p><strong>- revised</strong>: May 15, 1991</p>
<p><strong>1 int. the new york world - press room - morning 1</strong>:
The huge printing PRESSES POUND out the morning edition, setting a
rhythm that carries us through the scene as the newspapers are printed,
collated, folded, and spit out onto a rapidly-growing stack. Pressmen
bundle the papers and toss them into carts. See the masthead: “THE NEW
YORK WORLD, JULY 10, 1899.”</p>

ritual:</p>
<p><strong>kloppman</strong>: Ink’s wet, the presses are rolling, the

<p><strong>jack</strong>: Stupid question.</p>
<p><strong>crutchy</strong>: Stupid question.</p>

quiet pulse as the DELANCEY BROTHERS – OSCAR and MORRIS, two
muscle-bound goons – push with deliberate aggression past Jack and the
boys. Tension, silence, then –</p>

<p><strong>boots</strong>: Too rotten to be the sewer. It must be –</p>
<p><strong>crutchy</strong>: – the Delancey brothers!</p>

<p><strong>racetrack</strong>: Five to one, I say Cowboy skunks ‘em –

<p><strong>jack</strong>: That’s right. It’s an insult. And so’s this

<p><strong>19a continued: 19a</strong>: He speeds on – just as the

<p><strong>20 ext. circulation office - loading dock - same time
20</strong>: Newsies jostle for position at the window – David shoving
and jostling like the rest. He manages to elbow in near the front. Les,
hanging back, has his eyes on – – Jack sauntering coolly to his natural
place at the head of the line, flanked by Boots and Mush. He leans on
the counter and grins at the rodent-faced man inside the window: WEASEL,
40.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Ya miss me, Weasel?</p>
<p><strong>weasel</strong>: You know my name – it’s Weisel. Mister
Weisel to you. How many?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Don’t rush me – I’m perusin’ the mercandice…
Mr. Weasel.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: The usual.</p>
<p><strong>weasel</strong>: Hundred for the wiseguy – next!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: scans the newspaper for a catchy headline;
Race, Crutchy, the others wander up, doing the same. A commotion O.S.
and they look up to see – – at the window, Weasel is in David’s
face.</p>
<p><strong>weasel</strong>: Ya got ya papes – move outta here.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I paid for twenty – you only gave me
nineteen!</p>
<p><strong>weasel</strong>: You callin’ me a liar, kid…?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I want that other paper.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Nineteen, Weasel. An honest mistake – on
account of Oscar can’t count to twenty with his shoes on.</p>
<p><strong>weasel</strong>: Next!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hold it. Race – spot me two-bits.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Another fifty for my friend here.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I don’t want another fifty – !</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Sure you do. Every newsie wants more
papes.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: These papers are yours, I don’t take charity
from nobody! I don’t even know who you are –</p>
<p><strong>les</strong>: Cowboy! They call him Cowboy!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: That and a lotta other things – including Jack
Kelly, which is what my mudder called me. What do they call you,
kid?</p>
<p><strong>les</strong>: Les. This is David, he’s my brother. He’s
older.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No kiddin’. How old are you, Les?</p>
<p><strong>les</strong>: Near ten.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No good. Anybody asks, you’re seven. Younger
sells more papes, Les – and if we’re gonna be partners –</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Hold it! Who said anything about partners –
?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You owe me two bits, right? Okay, so I
consider it an investment. We sell together, split 70-30, plus you get
the benefit of observin’ me – no charge.</p>
<p><strong>crutchy</strong>: You’re gettin’ the chance of a lifetime
here – you learn from Jack, you learn from the best.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: If he’s the best, then why does he need
us?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I don’t need you, pal. But I ain’t got a cute
little brother to front for me. And Les here… … With this kid’s puss and
my God-given talent, we can easy move a thousand papers a week. Whattaya
say? Deal?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Gotta split fifty-fifty.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Sixty-forty. Or I forget the whole t’ing.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: The name of the game is volume, Dave. You only
took twenty papes – why?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Bad headline…?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: First t’ing you gotta learn – headlines don’t
sell papes, newsies sell papes. We’re what holds this town together –
without newsies, nobody knows nuttin’!</p>
<p><strong>pulitzer</strong>: ‘Trolley Strike Drags On for Third Week’ –
this so-called headline drags on for infinity!</p>
<p><strong>22 continued: 22</strong>: A hand smashes the paper onto an
ornate desk beyond which cower three harried employees of The World,
including SEITZ, 45, the hard-bitten business manager. BUNSEN, the
editor, and JONATHAN, an accountant.</p>
<p><strong>seitz</strong>: The news is slow, Chief, the Trolley Strike’s
all we got –</p>
<p><strong>pulitzer</strong>: It’s all Mr. William Randolph Hearst has,
too – see how he covers the strike!</p>
<p><strong>pulitzer</strong>: Hearst is killing us in the circulation
war – and you give me headlines that would put a whirling dervish to
sleep!</p>
<p><strong>bunsen</strong>: We’ll get a new headline writer,
Mr. Pulitzer.</p>
<p><strong>pulitzer</strong>: Steal Hearst’s man – offer him double what
Hearst pays.</p>
<p><strong>seitz</strong>: That’s how he stole him from us. Chief, you
spend as much as you make fighting Hearst. That’s why the paper’s losing
money –</p>
<p><strong>pulitzer</strong>: I created the World to be the best and
I’ll spend whatever it takes to – What is that deafening noise?</p>
<p><strong>seitz</strong>: Just the Newsies, Chief, I’ll –</p>
<p><strong>pulitzer</strong>: Never mind – where was I?</p>
<p><strong>seitz</strong>: Creating the World, Chief.</p>
<p><strong>pulitzer</strong>: This paper’s losing money because there’s
too much fat, inefficiency – not because I’m fighting to make us number
one! Well, we’re going to cut costs, maximize profits – and still beat
the socks off Hearst – I want to know how by tonight.</p>
<p><strong>23 ext. lower east side street - day 23</strong>:
UNDERSCORED: Jack leads David and Les through an open- air market
crowded with carts and people – all the sights and sounds and smells of
the melting pot.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Some newsies got corners, see – same spot,
same customers. Me, I like to keep moving, enjoy the life of the big
city. I spot an opportunity, I sell a pape. That’s the advantage of
being an independent businessman, instead of workin’ for wages.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Paper, mister?</p>
<p><strong>les</strong>: Extry – ‘Runaway Carriage Crushes Cop!’</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Oh, honey… look at that sweet little
lamb…</p>
<p><strong>les</strong>: He gimme a dime! He said I should go far away
and keep the change!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You’re a natural, kid. You remind me of me –
and I can’t say greater than that.</p>
<p><strong>25 ext. sidewalk - bare-knuckled boxers - day 25</strong>:
duke it out as sidewalk spectators watch. The boys work the crowd, each
in his own style –</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Extra, ‘Trolley strike drags on!’</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Nextry, nextry – ‘Ellis Island in flames – big
con-fla-gration!’</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What – ? Where’s that story – ?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Page nine – thank you, sir. Nextry, ‘Thousands
flee in panic –’</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: ‘Trash fire near immigration building
frightens seagulls – ?’</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: ‘Terrified flight from flaming inferno!’ Thank
you, much obliged –</p>
<p><strong>25 continued: 25</strong>: David is incredulous – then sees
Les by the boxers moving up to a spectator, assuming a pathetic
look.</p>
<p><strong>les</strong>: Buy me last pape, mista…?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Our father taught us not to lie.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Mine taught me not to starve. So we both got
an education.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You just make things up – like those
headlines.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I don’t do nothin’ the guys who write this
stuff don’t do. It ain’t lyin’ – it’s just improvin’ the truth a
little.</p>
<p><strong>les</strong>: The guy gave me a quarter! Quick, gimme some
more last papers!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Hold it – I smell beer!</p>
<p><strong>les</strong>: The guy bet me I wouldn’t drink some – that’s
how I made the quarter!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hey, no drinkin’ on the job – it’s bad for
business. What if somebody called a cop or somethin’?</p>
<p><strong>synder</strong>: There he is, officer – do your duty!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Beat it – the bulls!</p>
<p><strong>les</strong>: Just for one little sip of beer – ?</p>
<p><strong>26 ext. blindman’s alley - continuous action 26</strong>: The
boys pound down the alley, Snyder and MacSwain round the corner behind
them, Snyder shouting –</p>
<p><strong>snyder</strong>: You, Sullivan! Stop, I say! You hear me,
Sullivan?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Who’s Sullivan – ?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Mistaken identity – all micks look alike to
these birds!</p>
<p><strong>les</strong>: One sip! I didn’t even swallow it!</p>
<p><strong>a26a int. tenement building - continuous action
a26a</strong>: They clatter up flights of stairs – Snyder and MacSwain
clattering up below them, shouting –</p>
<p><strong>snyder</strong>: You young miscreant! Wait’ll I get you back
to the Refuge!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: The Refuge – ?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Sleeper!</p>
<p><strong>b26a ext. tenement roofs - continuous action b26a</strong>:
More sleepers; people living in makeshift shelters. Jack runs to a plank
stretched between two buildings.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’m not crossing that! Anyway, I don’t think
they’re chasing us –</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No? What’re they doin’ then?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I think they’re chasing you!</p>
<p><strong>26b ext. alley behind theater - day 26b</strong>: Jack runs
to a side door and opens it, waving David and Les inside. He follows,
giving a quick look around before he closes the door.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I want some answers – Why was he chasing you?
What’s the Refuge?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: The Refuge is this jail for kids. That guy,
Snyder, he’s the warden.</p>
<p><strong>les</strong>: You were in jail…? Why?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I was starvin’. I stole some food.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Right, food. He called you ‘Sullivan’ –</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah, food. My name’s Kelly, Jack Kelly, like
I told you. Think I’m lyin’?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You have a way of ‘improving the truth.’ Why
was he chasing you?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Because I escaped.</p>
<p><strong>les</strong>: Oh, boy. How?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: This big shot gimme a ride out in his
carriage.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Bet it was the mayor, right?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Nah. Teddy Roosevelt. Ever heard of him?</p>
<p><strong>medda</strong>: What is the meaning of this? No one is
allowed backstage – you will leave at once! Out, out, out, out –</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You wouldn’t kick me out without a kiss
goodbye, wouldya, Medda?</p>
<p><strong>medda</strong>: Kelly, where’ve you been, kid? I miss you up
in the balcony – you know I sing all my songs to you.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: This is David and Les. And this is the
greatest star of the vaudeville stage today, Miss Medda Larkson, the
Swedish Meadowlark.</p>
<p><strong>medda</strong>: Welcome!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Medda also owns the joint.</p>
<p><strong>medda</strong>: Don’t ever own a theater, kid. Don’t even
think about it.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I won’t. I promise.</p>
<p><strong>medda</strong>: What have we here – ? Aren’t you the cutest
little fella that ever was – yes, you are –</p>
<p><strong>les</strong>: Buy my last pape, lady?</p>
<p><strong>medda</strong>: This kid is good. Speaking as one
professional to another, I’d say you got a future.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Okay if we hang here awhile, Medda? ’Til a
little problem outside goes away?</p>
<p><strong>medda</strong>: As long as you like – now the lark must
warble. Hey, you – – give my guests whatever they want.</p>
<p><strong>26c continued: 26c</strong>: She winks at the dazzled boys
and hits the stage, singing:</p>
<p><strong>medda</strong>: ‘MY LOVEY-DOVEY BABY’… etc.</p>
<p><strong>27 omitted 27</strong>: thru thru 33 33</p>
<p><strong>34 ext. neighborhood street - night 34</strong>: Les is
looking green from all the candy as he follows Jack and David, balancing
on trolley tracks. In the distance, the FAINT sound of
SHOUTING/SINGING.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It’s late, my folks’ll be worried … What
about yours?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: They’re out west lookin’ for a place for us to
live – – like this.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: That’s Sante Fe – out in New Mexico? Soon’s
Pop finds us the right ranch, they’re sendin’ for me.</p>
<p><strong>les</strong>: Then you’ll be a real cowboy…</p>
<p><strong>35 ext. another street - night 35</strong>: Down the street,
a trolley is in flames, surrounded by a mob of shouting men. David looks
at it nervously.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Why don’t we divvy up at my place…? You can
meet my folks…</p>
<p><strong>mob</strong>: Scabs! Soak the scabs! Etc.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Jack – let’s get outta here – !</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Maybe tomorrow we get a decent headline.</p>
<p><strong>37 int. david’s apartment - night 37</strong>: The boys
enter, Jack carrying the sleeping Les. ESTHER, 38, is setting the
table.</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: My God…! What happened?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: He’s just sleeping, Momma –</p>
<p><strong>mayer</strong>: We’ve been waiting dinner – where’ve you
been?</p>
<p><strong>mayer</strong>: You made all this selling papers…?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Half of it’s Jack’s – he’s our selling
partner. And our friend. This is my parents.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: That’s Sarah. My sister.</p>
<p><strong>mayer</strong>: Esther – maybe David’s partner would like to
stay for dinner. Add some more water to the soup.</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: Mayer…!</p>
<p><strong>38 int. apartment - later 38</strong>: Les mumbles in his
sleep on a board stretched between two chairs. Jack, eating heartily,
his eloquence regained, holds forth at the dinner table.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What I saw today, I gotta say your boys are
born Newsies, Mr. Jacobs. With my experience and their hard work – just
a little more, thanks – – I figure we can peddle a thousand a week and
not break a sweat.</p>
<p><strong>mayer</strong>: That many…?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: More when the headline’s good.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: What makes a headline good?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Catchy words – like, uh, ‘corpse’ or ‘maniac,’
or, let’s see, ‘love nest’ or ‘nude’ –</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: ‘Scuse the language there, uh, maybe I’m
talkin’ too much…</p>
<p><strong>mayer</strong>: You talk fine, Jack – Sarah, get that cake
your mother’s been hiding in the cabinet!</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: That’s for your birthday tomorrow!</p>
<p><strong>mayer</strong>: I’ve had enough birthdays! This is a
celebration!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It’s only the beginning – the longer I work,
the more I’ll make –</p>
<p><strong>mayer</strong>: You work only until I go back to the factory!
Then you go back to school, like you promised.</p>
<p><strong>mayer</strong>: It will heal… they’ll give me back my job…
I’ll make them…</p>
<p><strong>les</strong>: ‘Gimme all ya got, baby…’</p>
<p><strong>39 ext. outside apartment - fire escape - later 39</strong>:
Jack and David talk; the family visible inside.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: How’d your pop get hurt?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: The factory. An accident. He’s no good to
them anymore so they just fired him. He’s got no union to protect
him.</p>
<p><strong>mayer</strong>: David? Time to come in now.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Why don’t you stay here tonight…?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I got my own place… but thanks. Your family’s
real nice, Dave. Like mine.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: See you tomorrow. Carryin’ the banner.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Carryin’ the banner.</p>
<p><strong>ain’t you glad nobody’s waiting</strong>: Jack starts down UP
FOR YOU? the fire escape to the alley below. WHEN I DREAM</p>
<p><strong>like the wind</strong>: Still singing, LIKE I’M GONNA LIVE
FOREVER Jack drops off the fire IT’S A FEELING TIME escape into the
alley; CAN NEVER TAKE AWAY moves to the sidewalk ALL I NEED’S A FEW MORE
DOLLARS and walks off. AND I’M OUTTA HERE TO STAY</p>
<p><strong>41 ext. neighborhood streets - same time 41</strong>: Jack
walks the streets, JACK past people cooling WHERE DOES IT SAY in the
night air, YOU GOTTA LIVE AND DIE HERE? outside their hot WHERE DOES IT
SAY tenements. A GUY CAN’T CATCH A BREAK?</p>
<p><strong>so that’s what they call a</strong>: Jack sees two cops
FAMILY coming and instinc- AIN’T YA GLAD YOU AIN’T THAT tively hides in

<p><strong>42 ext. newsies lodging house - same night 42</strong>: Jack
approaches the entrance as Racetrack comes down the sidewalk.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: How’d it go at the track, Race?</p>
<p><strong>racetrack</strong>: That hot tip I told you about? Nobody
told the horse.</p>
<p><strong>kloppman</strong>: You missed your supper, boys.</p>
<p><strong>racetrack</strong>: Then we didn’t miss much, did we?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I ate, Mr. Kloppman, I… … I was dinin’ with a
family.</p>
<p><strong>44a int. lodging house - washroom - continuous action
44a</strong>: Jack enters the empty room and walks past a row of wash
basins to the last one. He reaches beneath it, dislodges a brick and
removes a small box. In the box is a tin Prince Albert Tobacco can –
Jack puts today’s take inside it. Then he removes – – a photograph:
faded, dog-eared. Against a Coney Island western backdrop, fake cactus,
fake fence, a smiling man and woman beam down at a small boy in a cowboy
hat – it’s Jack, about Les’s age, with his parents. Jack sits hunched
under the basin, alone, staring at it…</p>
<p><strong>45 int. pulitzer’s office - night 45</strong>: Pulitzer in
his shirt-sleeves glowers impatiently as a prim 1899-vintage numbers
cruncher – JONATHAN – deliv- ers the bottom line with charts, graphs,
etc. Seitz lounges, yawning.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Actual income, as well as projected
income, against actual operating costs, as well as projected operating
costs, produce a reduced marginality of profit which in turn –</p>
<p><strong>pulitzer</strong>: Seitz! What in blazes is he talking
about?</p>
<p><strong>seitz</strong>: Says you need to make more money, Chief.</p>
<p><strong>pulitzer</strong>: Of course I need to make more money! But
how do I make more money, you bloodless blot?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: I have several proposals. The first is to
increase the paper’s price –</p>
<p><strong>pulitzer</strong>: Then Hearst undersells me and I’m in the
poorhouse. Brilliant.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Not the customer price – the price to the
distribution apparatus.</p>
<p><strong>seitz</strong>: You mean the Newsies…? Charge the Newsies
more for their papers? Bad idea, Chief.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Very well. My next proposal – salary cuts,
particularly those at the very top –</p>
<p><strong>pulitzer</strong>: Wait. What do the Newsies pay now – fifty
cents per hundred papers? If you raised it to sixty cents –</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: A mere tenth of a cent per paper –</p>
<p><strong>pulitzer</strong>: – then that, multiplied by forty thousand
papers a day, seven days a week – well, it would pay some of the bills
around here.</p>
<p><strong>seitz</strong>: Chief, if you do this, every Newsie we got
will head straight for Hearst.</p>
<p><strong>pulitzer</strong>: Not necessarily. As newspapermen, Hearst
and I would cut each other’s throats to get the best of the other. But
as businessmen – and gentlemen – we often agree on ways to keep down
certain operating costs. If I know Willie Hearst, he’s going to wish he
thought of this himself.</p>
<p><strong>seitz</strong>: What about the other papers – ?</p>
<p><strong>pulitzer</strong>: If we do it, they’ll all do it. It’s only
a tenth of a cent – nobody gets hurt! It’s good for the Newsies – an
incentive, make ’em work harder, sell more papers! Now get me Hearst on
that contraption.</p>
<p><strong>46 ext. newsie square - morning 46</strong>: Jack bounces
into the square, still basking in the glow of last night. He looks up to
the chalkboard and sees the headline: “BLOODY BEATINGS IN TROLLEY
STRIKE!” He grins, gives the high-sign – a very salable headline. He
moves on to –</p>
<p><strong>kid blink</strong>: They jacked up the price! Ten cents a
hunnerd – I can eat two days on ten cents!</p>
<p><strong>skittery</strong>: This’ll bust me – I’m barely makin’ a
livin’ now –</p>
<p><strong>bootsy</strong>: I’ll be back sleepin’ on the streets –</p>
<p><strong>mush</strong>: It don’t make no sense! All the money Pulitzer
makes, why would he gouge us?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Awright, pipe down! Don’t you see it’s a gag?
Just Weasel bein’ a weasel. Joke’s over, Wease. Gimme a hunnerd.</p>
<p><strong>weasel</strong>: Hunnerd’ll cost ya sixty, Cowboy.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I ain’t payin’ no sixty –</p>
<p><strong>weasel</strong>: Then move outta the way –</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You bet – I move right over to the
Journal.</p>
<p><strong>racetrack</strong>: It’s the same at the Journal – we checked
– it’s the same everywhere!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Why the jack-up, Weasel?</p>
<p><strong>weasel</strong>: Why not? It’s a nice day. Why don’t you ast
Mr. Pulitzer?</p>
<p><strong>weasel</strong>: If you ain’t buyin’ papes, clear out! World
employees only on this sida the gates.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It stinks here anyway – let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>48 ext. newsie square - continuous action 48</strong>: The
angry boys crowd around Jack.</p>
<p><strong>kid blink</strong>: They can’t do that to us –</p>
<p><strong>racetrack</strong>: They can do what they want – it’s their
stinkin’ paper –</p>
<p><strong>boots</strong>: Ain’t we got no rights – ?</p>
<p><strong>crutchy</strong>: Sure – we got the right to take it in the
t’roat!</p>
<p><strong>racetrack</strong>: It’s a rigged deck – why waste time
kiddin’ ourselves? They set the price, we gotta pay it –</p>
<p><strong>mush</strong>: We got no choice! So let’s get our lousy papes
while they still got some –</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Nobody’s goin’ anywhere – they ain’t gonna get
away with this!</p>
<p><strong>everybody</strong>: What can we do –</p>
<p><strong>les</strong>: Stop crowding him! Let him think!</p>
<p><strong>racetrack</strong>: Jack…? Ya still thinkin’… ?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: One thing for sure. If we don’t sell papes,
then nobody sells papes. Nobody comes through those gates ’til they put
the price back where it was.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You mean like a strike…?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah, a strike – good idea, Dave.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: No, I didn’t mean – we can’t strike, we’re
not a union –</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: We go on strike, we’re a union, right? Keep it
comin’, Dave –</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: There’s not enough of us – maybe if we got
every Newsie in New York –</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah, we organize – we get all the New York
Newsies to join us! This is great, Dave, keep talkin’ –</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It’s no joke! You saw what happened to those
trolley workers –</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Another great idea! Any Newsie don’t join with
us, we soak ’im – just like the trolley workers!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Nooo! Stop and think, willya? You can’t just
rush everybody into this!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Dave’s right again! We gotta think this
through! Old man Pulitzer and Hearst and all them other rich geezers,
they run this city. Do we really think a buncha streetrats like us would
have a chance against people like them?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: The choice has gotta be yours – are we gonna
just take what they give us? Or do we strike?</p>
<p><strong>les</strong>: Strike!</p>
<p><strong>boots</strong>: Keep talkin’, Jack – tell us what to do –</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Uh… uh… Pulitzer and Hearst have to respect
our rights –</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Pulitzer and Hearst have to respect the
workin’ boys of New York! Keep it comin’ – what else.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Uh… they can’t treat us like we don’t
exist…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: If we stick together like the trolley
workers, they can’t break us up.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It’s like a union. The Newsboy’s Union. Are
we really a union…?</p>
<p><strong>boots</strong>: What’s to stop someone else from sellin’ our
papes?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: We talk to ’em.</p>
<p><strong>racetrack</strong>: Some of ’em don’t hear so good.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Then we soak ’em.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: No! We can’t beat up kids in the street!
It’ll destroy what we’re trying to do!</p>
<p><strong>what’s it gonna take</strong>: Jack’s not listening now. TO
STOP THE SCABBERS?</p>
<p><strong>and our ranks will grow</strong>: Crutchy hobbles forward,
raising his crutch. CRUTCHY</p>
<p><strong>that we’ve been…</strong>: Jack jumps down from the statue.
JACK</p>
<p><strong>when the circulation bell</strong>: Two wagonloads of nervous
STARTS RINGING Newsies come through the WILL WE HEAR IT? gate. Some leap
off and join the strikers – most NEWSIES stay on the wagon. NO!</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: Jack steps forward. SO THEY GAVE THEIR WORD
Boots angrily throws a piece of rotten fruit toward The World Building.
BUT IT AIN’T WORTH BEANS</p>
<p><strong>and the fear is gone</strong>: Boots, apprehensive, looks up
at Jack in the wagon. BOOTS</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Jack and the others jump PULITZER MAY OWN THE

following, move across the square. ALL</p>
<p><strong>but he won’t whip us!</strong>: The Newsies answer back.
ALL</p>
<p><strong>but he won’t whip us!</strong>: Crossing the square, as ALL
they move towards the gates, AND THE WORLD WILL KNOW singing up to
Pulitzer’s AND THE WORLD WILL LEARN office in the dome at the AND THE
WORLD WILL WONDER top of The World Building. HOW WE MADE THE TABLES
TURN</p>
<p><strong>and the world will see</strong>: The Delanceys close the THAT

<p><strong>and the old will fall</strong>: The Newsies interlock arms
AND THE YOUNG STAND TALL forming a chain of AND THE TIME IS NOW
resistance and solidarity. AND THE WINDS WILL BLOW</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: We gotta get word out to all the Newsies in
New York! I gotta have some… whattaya call ’em –</p>

<p><strong>jack</strong>: Right! You guys gotta be embastards and tell
’em we’re on strike!</p>
<p><strong>kid blink</strong>: I’ll take Harlem!</p>
<p><strong>racetrack</strong>: I got mid-town! CRUTCHY</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Bumlet, Specs, Skittery take Queens; Pie Eater
and Snotty, the East side – Snipeshooter, go with ’em; okay, who wants
Brooklyn? Spot Conlon’s territory?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Whatsamatter? Scared of Brooklyn?</p>
<p><strong>boots</strong>: We ain’t scared of Brooklyn. But Spot Conlon
makes us a little nervous.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well, he don’t make me nervous. You and me,
Boots, we take Brooklyn. Dave can keep us company. Okay, Dave?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Sure. Right after you take our demands to
Pulitzer.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Me? To Pulitzer?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You’re the leader.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Maybe the kid’ll soften him up a little.</p>
<p><strong>denton</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: They’re going in to present our demands to
Pulitzer.</p>
<p><strong>denton</strong>: What demands?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: The Newsies’ demands. We’re on strike.</p>
<p><strong>denton</strong>: I’m Denton, New York Sun. What’s your
name?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: David…</p>
<p><strong>denton</strong>: David. As in David and Goliath? You really
think old man Pulitzer’s going to listen to your demands?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: He has to.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: So’s your ol’ lady! Tell Pulitzer he needs an
appointment with me!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: – So this snooty mug is sayin’, ‘You cawn’t
see Mr. Pulitzer, no one sees Mr. Pulitzer’ – real hoity-toity, you know
the type –</p>
<p><strong>les</strong>: Real hoity-toity –</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: – So I says, ‘I ain’t in the habit of
transactin’ business with no office boy – tell him Jack Kelly is here to
see him now.’</p>
<p><strong>les</strong>: That’s when they threw us out.</p>
<p><strong>denton</strong>: Doesn’t it scare you going up against the
most powerful man in New York?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah, lookit me, I’m tremblin’.</p>
<p><strong>denton</strong>: Keep me informed – I want to know everything
that happens.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Are we really an important story…?</p>
<p><strong>denton</strong>: What’s important? A year ago I covered the
war in Cuba – charging up San Juan Hill with Colonel Teddy Roosevelt. A
very important story. Now it doesn’t seem so important – except Teddy’s
our governor and probably on his way to the White House. Is the Newsies’
strike important? It all depends on you.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: My name really gonna be in the papers?</p>
<p><strong>denton</strong>: Any objections?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Not as long as you get it right – Kelly, Jack
Kelly. And, Denton? No pictures.</p>
<p><strong>50 ext. brooklyn bridge - dawn 50</strong>: Jack, David,
Boots are walking as we WIDEN OUT to reveal the magnificent bridge
against a dawn sky. They all seem a little nervous.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’ve never been to Brooklyn – have you
guys?</p>
<p><strong>boots</strong>: Spent a month there one night.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: This Spot Conlon… is he really as bad as they

bad or not? What’s the joke? Tell me, willya?</p>

<p><strong>55 ext. brooklyn waterfront - day 55</strong>: On a rotted
and collapsing pier is a battered sign: “BROOKLYN EXCURSIONS - CLOSED.”
Hunched under the pier is a tough kid playing a harmonica, his eyes
fixed on – – Jack, Boots, David as they cautiously approach through the
no-man’s land of mud and junk. Boys appear like hostile Indians – behind
them, to the side of them, in front of them – silently escorting them
under the pier. David looks very nervous as they are halted, and the
harmonica plays a signal, then stops abruptly.</p>
<p><strong>spot</strong>: If it ain’t Jack be nimble, Jack be quick.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You’re movin’ up in the world, Spot – got a
ocean view and everything.</p>
<p><strong>spot</strong>: So I’m hearin’ things from little birdies in
Harlem and Queens and all over. They’re chirpin’ in my ear:
‘Jackie-boy’s Newsies are playin’ like they’re goin’ on strike – ’</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: We’re not playing – we are on strike – it’s
–</p>
<p><strong>spot</strong>: What’s this, Jackie boy? Some kind of walkin’
mouth?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It’s a mouth with a brain – and if you got
half-a-one you’ll listen. Tell ’im, Davey.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Uh… we started the strike but… we can’t do it
alone, so… we’ve been talkin’ to Newsies all over the city…</p>
<p><strong>spot</strong>: So they told me. And what did they tell
you?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: That… they’re all waiting to see what Spot
Conlon does. That you’re the key… That Spot Conlon is the most respected
and… famous… newsie in New York… and probably everywhere else…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: And… if Spot Conlon joins the strike, they’ll
join and we’ll be unstoppable so you gotta join and … well… you
gotta…</p>
<p><strong>spot</strong>: You’re right. Brains. But I got brains, too –
and more than half-a-one. How do I know you punks won’t run the first
time some goon comes atcha with a club? How do I know you’re in it to
win?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: ‘Cause I’m tellin’ you.</p>
<p><strong>spot</strong>: Not good enough, Jackie-boy. You gotta show
me.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Maybe you lost your guts, Spotty- boy – – or
maybe you traded ’em to some chicken for that beak of yours. Maybe you
gotta show me you ain’t afraid to join the strike.</p>
<p><strong>spot</strong>: Nice try, pal. But that’s just what I’m
talkin’ about. Show me this strike ain’t just some kids do-or-dare, then
we’ll talk.</p>

<p><strong>jack</strong>: At least somebody’s got the right idea.</p>
<p><strong>pie eater</strong>: Who else is ready for stick-ball?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Who we kiddin’ here. Spot was right. Just a
game to these guys…</p>
<p><strong>crutchy</strong>: Hey, Jack – get a loada this!</p>

David following nervously.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: How can you be sure they sent Crutchy
here?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: How can I be sure the Delanceys stink – ‘cause
that’s how things work. An orphan gets arrested, Snyder gets him sent
here to be ’rehabilitated’ – – the more kids in the Refuge, the more
money the city sends to take care of ’em, and the more Snyder can steal.
He’s here alright.</p>
<p><strong>64a ext. house of refuge - roof - night 64a</strong>: Jack

Crutchy –</p>

Christmas but Snyder keeps tackin’ more time on his sentence –</p>

dangling on the rope.</p>

Dave up there? Hiya, Dave!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Go get your hat, Crutch – kiss Snyder
good-bye.</p>
<p><strong>crutchy</strong>: Yeah… hey, shoulda seen me in court today –
old Judge Movealong Monahan hisself! Took him two minutes to move me
along to Snyder for ‘my own good.’</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Later, Crutchy – get your stuff.</p>
<p><strong>crutchy</strong>: Listen, Jack… truth is, I ain’t walkin’ so

<p><strong>crutchy</strong>: I don’t want nobody carryin’ me –

rode outta here on that coach!</p>

coach?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Not in it. On it.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What was he doing at the Refuge?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Runnin’ for governor. Showin’ his concern,
like all pols during elections.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Teddy’s not like other politicians. He’s the
biggest hero in the country.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Anyway, he’s there. I see his fancy coach
waitin’ for ‘im, so I sneaks on top of it. Teddy gets in and he’s wavin’
goodbye, and all the guys are wavin’ goodbye, and Snyder’s wavin’ –
‘Good-byeeee, Colonel Roosevelt!’ So just as we’re goin’ out the gate, I
stands up and – ‘Good-byeee, Warden Snyder!’ It was in the papes and
everything.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: He’s governor now. I don’t understand how he
could see that place and not do anything –</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: He only seen what Snyder wanted him to – good
food, everything the city pays for that Snyder usually steals.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’ll bet if he just knew – I mean, he’s a
hero –</p>

They write good things about me, the customers flock here like sheep.
They give me the pan, I’m the one who gets sheared.</p>

<p><strong>chief</strong>: We can’t just charge in and break it up,
Mr. Pulitzer – we got no legal cause.</p>
<p><strong>pulitzer</strong>: Would the fact that this rally is
organized by an escaped criminal be cause enough, Mayor?</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: An escaped criminal…?</p>
<p><strong>pulitzer</strong>: A fugitive from one of your prisons, Mayor
– a convicted thief who’s been at large for some time under the alias of
‘Jack Kelly.’ His real name is…?</p>
<p><strong>snyder</strong>: Sullivan, Your Honor – Francis Sullivan. I
would have caught him before now but –</p>

I believe you appointed him.</p>

want this rabble he’s roused to see what happens to those who dare to –
well, they should see justice in action.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Arrest him at the rally? But…</p>
<p><strong>pulitzer</strong>: By the way, Mayor, I’m having a few
friends for cards that night – newspaper friends, Willie Hearst, Gordon
Bennett. Perhaps you’ll join us – we can talk about the coming
election.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: I’d be honored… thank you.</p>

Spot, Race, Mush, Boots, Blink pick dispiritedly at a plate of
knockwurst. Les, hungry as always, finishes a large sausage and takes
another as he listens.</p>
<p><strong>kid blink</strong>: He won’t be there long – the jail ain’t
built that Jack can’t bust outta.</p>
<p><strong>boots</strong>: They’re buildin’ some mighty good jails these
days…</p>
<p><strong>racetrack</strong>: So where’s Denton?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: He said he’d be here. We can’t let this stop
us. We gotta keep the strike going, just like Jack was here.</p>
<p><strong>mush</strong>: Yeah, but Jack ain’t here.</p>
<p><strong>racetrack</strong>: We know that, genius – if he was here,
he’d be tellin’ us what to do when he ain’t here.</p>
<p><strong>spot</strong>: You bummers is givin’ me a headache.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Where you goin’? We need you.</p>
<p><strong>spot</strong>: Nachally Spot Conlon is needed wherever –
which right now is Brooklyn. Some of my boys is worried, I must give ear
to their concerns –</p>
<p><strong>spot</strong>: – and reassure them.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Why didn’t The Sun print the story?</p>
<p><strong>denton</strong>: Because it never happened.</p>
<p><strong>david/all</strong>: Never happened; whattaya mean? Etc.</p>
<p><strong>denton</strong>: If it’s not in the papers, then it never
happened. The owners decreed that it not be in the papers, therefore… I
just came to tell you fellows goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Denton, what’s happened – you get fired or
somethin’?</p>
<p><strong>denton</strong>: Reassigned – back to my old job as The Sun’s
ace war correspondent. The owner thinks I should be covering only the
‘really important’ stories. So wish me luck, boys. At least half what I
wish you. They don’t always fire you, David.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: They bought you off… didn’t they? Didn’t
they!</p>
<p><strong>denton</strong>: They could’ve blackballed me from every
paper in the country. I’m a newspaperman, I have to have a paper to
write for.</p>
<p><strong>denton</strong>: This is the story I wrote about the rally. I
want you to read it at least.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: We bust Jack out of the Refuge tonight. From
now on, we depend on nobody but the Newsies.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: That’s where we saw Crutchy…</p>
<p><strong>120 ext. house of refuge - courtyard - night 120</strong>: A
carriage is waiting. The boys watch as a door opens and two figures
emerge. One is Snyder, the other is Jack. They get into the carriage and
it starts toward the boys – who quickly duck out of sight as it CLIP-
CLOPS past and enters the street.</p>
<p><strong>mush</strong>: Where they takin’ him…?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: One way to find out. Meet me back at the
square!</p>

<p><strong>123 ext. pulitzer mansion - night 123</strong>: David hangs
on to the back of the carriage, peering around to see some huge stone
gates as it moves into a circular drive and stops. He sees a figure
waiting:</p>
<p><strong>seitz</strong>: Get him inside.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Very impressive. So where do they keep the
trains in this station?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Sorry to see you ain’t doin’ so good, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>126 ext. mansion - at carriage - night 126</strong>: The
Driver strolls around the rear of the carriage – just as David slips
beneath it and begins to crawl care- fully toward the front. Finding the
lynch-pin that hitches the horses to the carriage, he reaches for it –
just as the horse snorts and pulls the carriage forward a few steps. The
Driver hurries back to the reins. With the Driver’s boots a few inches
from his face, David waits for another chance…</p>
<p><strong>127 int. pulitzer’s study - night 127</strong>: Pulitzer
paces, watching Jack look at the books, the art, at framed front pages;
headlines of the world’s great events…</p>
<p><strong>pulitzer</strong>: Know what I was doing when I was your age?
I was in a war. The Civil War.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I heard of it. You win?</p>
<p><strong>pulitzer</strong>: People think wars are about right and
wrong. They’re not. They’re about power. You know what power is?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Heard of that, too. I don’t just sell ya
papes, Joe. Sometimes I read ’em.</p>
<p><strong>pulitzer</strong>: Power means that I could see to it that
you serve your full sentence at the Refuge. Or I could pull strings and
have you free tomorrow. It means I could give you my pocket change – and
you’d have more money than you’d likely ever earn.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You bribin’ me, Joe? Thanks for the
compliment, but I ain’t got the power to stop the strike –</p>
<p><strong>pulitzer</strong>: I disagree. You’re the spirit of the
strike, without you, they’d fall apart in a few days.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Ring for my coach, willya? It’s past my
bedtime –</p>
<p><strong>pulitzer</strong>: Shut your mouth and listen ! You’re going
to do exactly as I say –</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: – or what? You’ll send me back to the Refuge?
I’ll bust out again –</p>
<p><strong>pulitzer</strong>: – and be a fugitive who’s pursued and
caught and returned. I’m offering you a choice – is that what you
choose?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I told ya… I can’t call off the strike.</p>
<p><strong>pulitzer</strong>: I’m not asking you to. All I ask is that
you return to your old job – as Newsie for the The World.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: And be a scab? Forget it –</p>
<p><strong>pulitzer</strong>: For a few days. Then the strike ends – and
it will end, boy, make no mistake – and you can go wherever you want to
buy a ticket. Free and clear, with money in your pocket… and no one
chasing you.</p>
<p><strong>pulitzer</strong>: You go back to the Refuge. Think it over
in your cell. Let me know in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Jack!</p>
<p><strong>128 continued: 128</strong>: Jack is surprised. He looks at
Snyder and Seitz, pulls away from Seitz, slides down a bannister, and
leaps to the ground. Snyder lunges for Jack, who manages to evade
Snyder’s reach.</p>
<p><strong>snyder</strong>: After him!</p>
<p><strong>seitz</strong>: Don’t worry. He’s got no place to go.</p>
<p><strong>128a ext. nearby street/stone pillar - night 128a</strong>:
At the pillar, Jack stops running.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Why’re you stoppin’ – we’ve got to run!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You shouldn’t’a done this, David. They could
put you in jail –</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It’s worth it – let’s go –</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You go to jail, what happens to your family?
You don’t know nothin’ about jail! Thanks for what you done, but you
gotta get outta here –</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I don’t understand –</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I don’t either – I don’t understand nothin’ no
more!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Just go!</p>
<p><strong>128a continued: 128a</strong>: David looks over his shoulder
and runs off, leaving Jack alone on the street. Jack steps into the
shadows as we…</p>
<p><strong>guidin’ me today</strong>: Jack looks up as the serving panel
opens and Crutchy peers through, offering him something furtively: a
boiled potato.</p>
<p><strong>crutchy</strong>: Snitched it offa Snyder’s plate when I was
servin’ him – the biggest one! Snyder was eatin’ good tonight – the
stuff we don’t never get? Patatas… olives… … liver and bacon.
Sauerkraut… Guess what I done to his sauerkraut.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: So what’s it git’cha?</p>
<p><strong>crutchy</strong>: Anudder three months, prob’ly. But you

terrified of the Newsies strike – because other child laborers in the
factories and sweatshops are hearing the message of the Newsies leader

too- large caps and too-small coats, holding lunchpails… holding picks
and shovels far too large for them… girls in shapeless dresses sewing,

<p><strong>188 int. pulitzer’s office - day 188</strong>: The SONG
RESONATES in the golden dome; Pulitzer stares down at the crowd as the
mayor, sweating as usual, waves the Newsies’ paper at him. Seitz sits
reading a copy, impressed, as Jonathan fields phone calls.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: They’re all yelling at me – me! – factory
owners, bankers, businessmen – the whole city’s at a standstill and
they’re blaming it on me – !</p>
<p><strong>pulitzer</strong>: Kelly’s down there. He should be back in

<p><strong>seitz</strong>: Those kids got out a pretty good paper,
Chief.</p>

couldn’t have done this on their own. Somebody’s behind this, trying to
pull a fast one…</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Mr. Hearst on the line, sir. Wants to know
if you’ve read the Newsies’ paper?</p>

leaving them alone. Pulitzer waits by the windows, a looming shadowy
figure; sounds of CHANTING, SHOUTING floating up from below. David is
awed by the palatial office, but Jack saunters coolly to the windows
past –</p>
<p><strong>pulitzer</strong>: You’re going to listen to me, boy –</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’d like to, Joe – – but I can’t hear ya.</p>
<p><strong>pulitzer</strong>: We had a deal – you broke it. You’re going

<p><strong>jack</strong>: Maybe. But you can’t put every kid in that
square in jail. They ain’t goin’ away, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>pulitzer</strong>: Neither am I. I can wait them out. It
won’t be me that’s hurt.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You sure about that?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: ‘Since the strike, the World’s circulation
has dropped 70 per cent; advertising has been cut in half –’ Every day
you lose thousands of dollars – just so you can beat us out of a lousy
tenth of a cent per paper. Why?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It ain’t about money, Dave – if Joe gives in,
that would mean nothin’s like us got power. He can’t let that happen –
no matter what it costs him. Right, Joe?</p>
<p><strong>pulitzer</strong>: I’m about to show you what power really
is…</p>

<p><strong>jack</strong>: Ya got me, Joe – but tell me one thing,
willya? How’d ya like our paper – nice printin’, ain’t it? Right off the
presses of one of New York’s greatest newspapers –</p>
<p><strong>pulitzer</strong>: All the papers have an agreement… we print
nothing about the newsies. Whose press did you use? It was Hearst,
wasn’t it…!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hearst? Nah, it was yo –</p>
<p><strong>pulitzer</strong>: I knew it. Whoever helped you print this
lying rag is trying to break the strike, get the jump on the rest of us.
Well, you’re going to expose this backstabber to the other owners – in
exchange, I’ll call off the police.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Not enough, Joe – you gotta deal with our
demands. Otherwise, our lips are sealed.</p>
<p><strong>pulitzer</strong>: All right, all right – just say the
traitor’s name. It’s Hearst, isn’t it? Say it! Say the name of the
scoundrel whose press you used so I can make him the disgrace of the
newspaper world! Say his name, damn you!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: We just wanna say, ‘Thanks, Joe.’ And Hearst
and them other owners? Maybe they don’t have to know. Depends.</p>
<p><strong>pulitzer</strong>: Perhaps we can resolve our… small
differences.</p>
<p><strong>189 omitted 189</strong>: &amp; &amp; 190 190</p>
<p><strong>191 ext. newsie square - day 191</strong>: Race, Boots, Les,
etc. unpacking rotten fruit, getting ready for action. They see several
police moving into the square – including a paddy wagon.</p>
<p><strong>race</strong>: We gotta warn Jack – !</p>
<p><strong>193 ext. courtyard - gates of the world - day 193</strong>:
Behind Weasel and the line of goons Jack and David are approaching,
beaming in triumph. Seitz is with them. Les quickly slips through the
bars, running to tell Jack – but Weasel grabs him, shoves him back
roughly –</p>
<p><strong>les</strong>: Jack – ! Jack – !</p>
<p><strong>weasel</strong>: I don’t know how he got in here, Mr. Seitz –
but I’ll take care of him, with pleasure. Just say the word!</p>
<p><strong>seitz</strong>: With pleasure. You’re fired.</p>
<p><strong>weasel</strong>: Come again…?</p>
<p><strong>les</strong>: He said, you’re fired.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: The strike’s over – we beat ’em!</p>
<p><strong>193 continued: 193</strong>: A huge roar goes up outside the
gates – they swing open and the Newsies swarm in, engulfing Weasel and
the Delanceys – trying to look like part of the gang – as they rush to
mob Jack and David. Jack spots Sarah – she’s waving and pointing in
alarm at something.</p>
<p><strong>les</strong>: The bulls! Jack – the bulls!</p>
<p><strong>denton</strong>: We brought the Warden over to say goodbye.
Goodbye, Warden.</p>
<p><strong>crutchy</strong>: Remember what I told ya – first t’ing ya do
in jail, you make friends with the rats, share what you got in common –
Hiya, Jack! My leg tells me the strike’s over!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Crutchy – I don’t get it. What happened –
?</p>
<p><strong>crutchy</strong>: Ya orta seen it, Jack – he came chargin’
into the Refuge wavin’ his walkin’ stick like a sword and he’s leadin’
this army of lawyers and cops and Snyder’s hidin’ in the patata bin
–</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What’re you talkin’ about – who come chargin’
in?</p>
<p><strong>crutchy</strong>: Who? Your pal! Him!</p>
<p><strong>elegant coach</strong>: parked across the square. A Rough
Rider opens the door and a man leans forward – a glimpse of silk hat and
walrus mustache as Teddy Roosevelt raises his walking stick in salute to
Jack across the square.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: Jack is awestruck; so are the other
Newsies gathering around. Denton moves up to Jack.</p>
<p><strong>denton</strong>: Governor Roosevelt’s very grateful that this
problem was brought to his attention. He’d like to offer you a lift,
anywhere you like. This time, you ride inside.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Think he could drop me at the train yards?</p>
<p><strong>racetrack</strong>: You really goin’ this time…?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It’s now or never, Racetrack.</p>
<p><strong>racetrack</strong>: Won’t be the same without ya. Give ya
even odds on that.</p>
<p><strong>kid blink</strong>: See ya in the funny papes, cowboy –</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah, Blink, keep ya eye peeled.</p>
<p><strong>mush</strong>: Ya hear what he said – Blink says… ya hear
it?</p>
<p><strong>boots</strong>: We heard it. My best shooters. Never know
when ya need good shooters.</p>
<p><strong>spot</strong>: Take it easy, Jackie- boy. Ya ever get in a
spot – – think of me.</p>
<p><strong>crutchy</strong>: Don’t wanna alarm ya, Jack, but what I
hear, out West ain’t like New York at all – it’s fulla bulls, for one
t’ing – not cops, neither, but big ugly animals with horns and –</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’ll miss ya, Crutch.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I ain’t no good at writin’ and stuff but… I’ll
be thinkin’ of ya…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You don’t have to run away anymore, Jack. You
have a choice now.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: We won today, but the fight’s not over.
You’re needed, Jack. We need you. Here.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Maybe that’s what scares me…</p>
<p><strong>music begins: reprise: “carryin’ the banner”
approx:</strong>: 3:00 The Newsies sing as they MUSH line up, trying to
keep TRY BOTTLE ALLEY OR THE their spirits up. HARBOR</p>
<p><strong>193b ext. loading dock/window - newsies 193b</strong>: sing
as they wait for papers, but something’s missing… NEWSIES a voice, a
presence, a IT’S A FINE LIFE, spirit – and then – CARRYIN’ THE BANNER… –
Jack leaps onto the dock and rings the bell –</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Call it, Les!</p>
<p><strong>les</strong>: Comin’ down the chute!</p>
