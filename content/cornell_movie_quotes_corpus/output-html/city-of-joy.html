<h1 id="city-of-joy">city-of-joy</h1>
<p><strong>ext. bihar - day</strong>: Heat that has mass. That rises off
the parched earth in shimmering waves. After a moment, we see what
appear to be figures coming out of the haze, one by one. A family with
their few belongings: HASARI PAL, 33, his wife, ALOKA, 28, and their
children, daughter, AMRITA, 13, sons MANOOJ and SHAMBU, 11 and 9;
HASARI’S MOTHER and FATHER. They embark toward the night, the rising sun
behind them.</p>
<p><strong>ext. roadside - bus stop - day</strong>: Hasari’s Father
passes a gourd of precious water. Hasari serves the children first.
Shambu gulps entirely too much, the others forcing him to stop by a
unified force of will. Embarrassed, he passes the cup to his brother,
who sips, as does his sister. Aloka barely wets her lips, insisting on
leaving the last drops for Hasari. And now, a rooster tail of dust rises
up behind the approaching bus and the old parents bid farewell to their
son’s family. There is an intense sadness at leaving the land and
Hasari’s Mother clings to him…</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: I’ll send money soon.</p>
<p><strong>hasari’s mother</strong>: Don’t let the children out of your
sight. Not for a moment.</p>
<p><strong>hasari’s mother</strong>: Help your parents. Don’t fight with
each other. And, Manooj, stay away from the cinema, do you hear?</p>
<p><strong>shambu</strong>: I don’t want to go. There are bad men with
long knives who steal children.</p>
<p><strong>hasari’s father</strong>: A man’s journey to the end of his
obligations is a very long road. Yours begins here.</p>
<p><strong>ext. roadside/int. bus - day</strong>: There’s not an empty
inch inside the little vehicle or on top. The passengers are silent. A
woman breast feeds a baby. Several passengers fan themselves. Many
sleep. The Pals squeeze wearily into the rear seat.</p>
<p><strong>manooj</strong>: Our farm has died, so we are moving to
Calcutta to become rich!</p>
<p><strong>int. ashram - another flower - day</strong>: This flower
floats gently in a bowl of water. The TITLES END as we PULL BACK SLOWLY
to reveal a dozen Anglos, several Indians, and one Kenyan seated
cross-legged before an aging Yogi, who’s quietly urging the suppli-
cants to find “their light, allow your white light to fill your spirit’s
eye.” Above, ceiling fans move the air.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: As we PAN the group, we see that
everyone has his/her eyes closed in earnest meditation… until we COME TO
an American, MAX LOEB, 29, who pops open first his right eye – looks to
his right and left – closes his right eye and opens his left eye – looks
left and right… and then, instead of continuing the mantra and the
search for his white light, expels a stream of air through his pursed
lips, making a vibrating, flatulent sound, one indicative of sizeable
frustration and dismissal.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Get serious.</p>
<p><strong>int. spartan room - trumpet - day</strong>: Max closes the
trumpet case and starts chucking his clothes and books in a knapsack and
a small valise. We notice the Hebrew letter chai on a gold chain around
his neck. His girl friend, BETSY KAHN, overdressed somewhat in an Indian
style, endeavors to exercise the inner peace she’s been pursuing…</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I swear to God, you never give anything
enough time! What did you expect in five days, Max?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Only what they promise in the brochure: Inner
peace, serenity, and a nice chant that gets rid of this rock in my gut.
E.S.T., they do you in a weekend.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I would really appreciate it if you wouldn’t
be terribly glib just now, Max.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Am I to assume you’ll be at the airport in
Calcutta a week from tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Impossible to predict, Betsy Ilene Kahn. Maybe
you better give me my ticket.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Screw you, Max – I paid for it! How many
times am I going to let you walk out on me and come back?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I think only you can answer that, Betsy Ilene
Kahn.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Do you really think that’s an appropriate way
to get rid of your Western rage, Bets?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: One slap is romantic. Two would call for
retaliation… Lend me a hundred dollars.</p>
<p><strong>ext. country airport - winding road - day</strong>: Cool,
lush hills. A little pack of single-engine two- and four-seaters. Max,
in shorts and University of Miami T-shirt, hot, sweaty, appears around a
bend in the approach road.</p>
<p><strong>int. airport - waiting room</strong>: A small service desk. A
CLERK, who doubles as Ground Control on the microphone, passing on the
prevailing wind and the active runway. We hear the STATIC-BACKED VOICE
of a PILOT, giving his call numbers, then announcing he’s clear for
immediate takeoff on the active runway. The Clerk CLICKS off and finds
Max.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: How you doin’?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’ve always wanted to walk into a little
airport just about like this one and ask the guy at the counter the
following question. Ready?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: When’s the next flight to anywhere?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: To Bombay. Tomorrow, at one o’clock in the
afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>ext. airport - low angle - day</strong>: Max sits on the
ground, up against the building, playing a jazz line quietly and rather
well on his trumpet. A pair of well-shod feet ENTER the FRAME. Max looks
up.</p>
<p><strong>veejay</strong>: I say, are you looking for a way out of
here? We have an extra seat. Where are you wanting to go?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’m wanting to go wherever you’re wanting to
take me.</p>
<p><strong>int. 180 four-seater - day</strong>: Max is crammed into the
back seat with the plump Ravi.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: We see now that, contrary to our
assumption that Veejay would be in the left seat, it’s Manubai who’s
flying the plane. The NOISE of the ENGINE forces them to speak somewhat
loudly.</p>
<p><strong>veejay</strong>: We were among the fortunate back in ’48. We
got out of East Bengal before partition destroyed so many. We make
mattresses. The Rajah Double Spring.</p>
<p><strong>veejay</strong>: We don’t have a flight attendant on this
flight… Are you a musician, Mr. Loeb?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Unattached trumpet player and
recently-certified associate guru.</p>
<p><strong>ext. howrah station - day</strong>: A huge bridge dominates
the skyline. The train trundles to a stop, its WHISTLE clearing the way.
People hang on its sides, sit on the roof… and now flood the platform,
flowing into the station, clearing a view for us of the Pals, clinging
to their baggage in the middle of this human anthill.</p>
<p><strong>close on them</strong>: Hands reach out with sweets to sell,
with tea, asking for money.</p>
<p><strong>manooj</strong>: Daddy, I’m scared.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: Scared? No – why? This is very exciting. As
soon as we get to our friend’s house, everything will be fine.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: Wait right here. Don’t move.</p>
<p><strong>with hasari</strong>: He moves to a line of VENDORS, shows a
piece of paper to one, as he digs out his precious screw of money to
make a purchase of sweets from the Vendor.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: Please, can you direct me to my friend at
this address? We are to stay with him.</p>
<p><strong>vendor #1</strong>: There’s no such address as this in
Calcutta.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: But that’s not possible.</p>
<p><strong>vendor #1</strong>: Of course it is possible! I have lived
here all my life. You are new. Who would know if a place exists or does
not?</p>
<p><strong>vendor #2</strong>: Bombay, perhaps. Delhi. Look there.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Dear God, what now? Stunned, Hasari
hands Vendor #1 a rupee and, with the sweets, turns back to his family,
his face going through a magical transformation as he prepares to
suggest to the family that all is well.</p>
<p><strong>ext. chowringhee lane - day</strong>: A few clean and
cared-for Ambassador cars sweep into the gateway of the Grand Hotel,
past a gateman.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: The Pals, scared, dispirited, weary,
consumed by the crowd. They’ve been walking a long time. Shambu cries;
Aloka tries to ease his fear. They stop numbly at the edge of the park,
put their bundles down against a long wall. Across the way, a thin
policeman shares a cigarette with a group of traders. There is a deeply
fearful look in Hasari’s eyes, a look he is having difficulty
controlling now. He needs to revive the family’s confidence. He takes
out his precious bundle of rupees and gives one to Manooj. Manooj,
though, is fixed on the cinema across the street. Hasari indicates a
stall just across the main road.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: Manooj, go and get some fruit. Come straight
back.</p>
<p><strong>gangooly</strong>: Yes, hello, brother. Bihar, am I
correct?</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: Yes, how did you know?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Hasari is torn between speaking to the
man and watching his son’s incredible journey across the street.</p>
<p><strong>gangooly</strong>: Let me say only that the terrible
malevolence that has visited your part of the country affects us
all.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: Three years without rain. Nothing came out
of the earth but debts.</p>
<p><strong>gangooly</strong>: Terrible. And now, the family on the
street. It is not acceptable. And if I can’t help, my name is not
Mr. Gangooly… Which, blessedly, it is.</p>
<p><strong>ext. small building in back street - day</strong>: A brick
slides out of the wall. We’re BEHIND the brick and see Gangooly’s soft
face as he reaches in and pulls out a key. The street is small and
empty. Though the houses are nothing much, to the Pals, they look like
palaces. Manooj and Shambu run about in delight. Gangooly motions for
quiet. With a flourish, he opens the door.</p>
<p><strong>int. small room - day</strong>: Gangooly enters, glances
around, waves the Pals in. They’re amazed. There’s a cage occupied by
two parrots. In one corner, a small altar dedicated to the goddess
Lakshmi is decorated with some flowers and, behind a torn, plastic
curtain in a corner, part kitchen, part wash place, containing a tap
with running water.</p>
<p><strong>gangooly</strong>: Be free – look around.</p>
<p><strong>gangooly</strong>: They’ll need feeding. Give them seed. But
don’t spoil them.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: He bows briefly before the altar as he
moves to the washing area.</p>
<p><strong>gangooly</strong>: And now, one of the miracles of life in
the city. One and two…</p>
<p><strong>gangooly</strong>: Holy water from the Ganges! Flows out
forever. Come – touch it.</p>
<p><strong>gangooly</strong>: Drink! It’s as pure as the dew on Shiva’s
lips.</p>
<p><strong>gangooly</strong>: Now, this place is yours for two weeks. My
cousin, Moti, is away, traveling. Normally, the rent takes fifty rupees
for a week, but for a brother, forty. No, don’t thank me.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: I have only seventy-five, but as soon as I
have work…</p>
<p><strong>gangooly</strong>: Give me the fifty, pay the rest next week.
You’ll find work, I trust you. Aren’t I from Bihar, too? Yes.</p>
<p><strong>gangooly</strong>: You are pleased? Then Mr. Gangooly is
pleased. It’s how I am.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: He turns on his heel and he’s gone. For
a moment, the Pals are still, swept from the brink of catastrophe to
salvation… and now, as one, they release their sheer and utter joy.</p>
<p><strong>int. chattergee staircase - day</strong>: Ravi and Veejay
leading Max up the grand staircase, Manubai in the foyer, looking after
them.</p>
<p><strong>int. guest room - day</strong>: Ravi leads the way into a
lovely guest bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>ravi</strong>: I hope this is all right. The room hasn’t been
aired or the bed turned, but –</p>
<p><strong>veejay</strong>: Oh, he doesn’t care about that, do you, Max?
Here, look here.</p>
<p><strong>veejay</strong>: Help yourself. Be comfortable. Ravi, come
on, go, go, let’s leave the young man to himself.</p>
<p><strong>his pov</strong>: The beautiful Manubai in the garden.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: He lies down on the bed. He’s found
Nirvana.</p>
<p><strong>int. main room - day</strong>: It’s Hasari who watches now.
There’s LAUGHTER from Aloka and Amrita. Joyful SHOUTS from the boys.
Hasari is alone in the main room, on his knees, in front of the pile of
their baggage and bundles. He turns his atten- tion from the laughter to
a just-opened, old suitcase. He takes out a small tea box. Opens it
delicately.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: It’s full of something brown. He pushes
his fingers in and feels this bit of earth with a tenderness that’s
almost religious, puts a pinch to his nose and breathes it in. The
LAUGHTER and SHOUTING from the bathing area is GROWING.</p>
<p><strong>int. bathing area</strong>: Shambu is paddling near the tap.
Aloka is bending over the drain and Amrita is rinsing her heavy, dark
hair with a pot. Manooj is nearby, rubbing himself with an old towel.
Hasari enters unnoticed and looks at the group with tenderness… and with
gratitude for their good fortune.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: What are you doing here? Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: My name is Pal, Hasari. Mr. Gangooly rented
this space to –</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Mr. Who?</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: Gangooly. You must be his cousin,
Mr. Moti.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I don’t know any Gangooly and my name is Binal
and this is my home – get out!</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: But this is true. We paid him a deposit of
fifty –</p>
<p><strong>binal</strong>: A man goes out because he has to work, and
some beggar tries to move in while his back is turned.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: This while Binal has begun to throw
things out onto the street, though this cleansing of his home doesn’t
stop him from picking up a stick. The odd sympathizer meets with…</p>
<p><strong>binal</strong>: So, should I suffer if they are so stupid to
jump into the first mouth that wants to eat them?</p>
<p><strong>binal</strong>: You’re lucky I don’t kill you!</p>
<p><strong>ext. small street - day</strong>: Full of neighbors. There’s
a suppressed violence in the air. A man pushes Aloka. Sweat streaming
down his face, Hasari confronts the man. A WOMAN pushes the men
apart.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Go to the river. Try to squeeze in there.</p>
<p><strong>ext. victoria monument - street - night</strong>: Calcutta
broiling: Buses, vendors, carts, rickshaws, children beg at car windows.
The Pals stand, uncertain, and for the first time a rickshaw fills
Hasari’s eye, carrying two passengers. But now he shoulders his burden
and leads the family toward the river. We HOLD until they grow small
against the setting sun, gleaming red against the white domes of the
Victoria Monument.</p>
<p><strong>int. chattergee’s library - torso - night</strong>: Moving
through the dark, a figure, touching things, looking at photographs of
the Chattergees. We hear a MUFFLED DIALOGUE mixed with the SINGING a la
Dean Martin of “Everybody Loves Somebody Sometime”: “Goddamn it, boy,
what’s the matter with you? –”Everybody loves somebody sometime” – “Go
for it, son!” – “Sure, Dad, whatever you say, Dad.” – “Everybody falls
in love somehow” – “You’re the dad, Dad.” Now, a humidor. Max opens it,
takes out a cigar, takes two. Takes five. Senses someone. Turns.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: Ravi in her bathrobe.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’m starving.</p>
<p><strong>ravi</strong>: Well, you don’t want to eat those awful
cigars. Come with me, we’ll wake up the cook, she’ll fix you something
proper.</p>
<p><strong>ext. river bank - howrah bridge - day</strong>: The bridge
etched against the dawn sky. The corpse of an indigent is collected and
put on a cart.</p>
<p><strong>manooj</strong>: With his eyes open, watching the dead man
being removed.</p>
<p><strong>family</strong>: After their humiliating flight, they found
refuge here. Tiny figures huddled together with their baggage and
bundles, near a tree, not far from the steps that dip down to the smooth
water. Hasari’s eyes, too, are on the dead man, that warning. He kneels
beside Manooj, strokes him. The boy’s eyes turns to the man’s, wondering
if the man can provide for them.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: Don’t let it frighten you. You have to be
brave. I know we’ll find work today.</p>
<p><strong>ext. docks - day</strong>: Hasari at the gates, the family
huddled together in the b.g. The man behind the gate shakes his head,
points.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: A line of a hundred men stretches
from a door. Hasari is on the edge of panic, but when he turns to the
family, he’s wearing his confident smile. As before, he gathers the
family into the protectorate of his arms and guides them onward. As he
pushes off into the sea of humanity, we PULL BACK AND UP, FILLING the
FRAME WITH street upon street, disappearing Hasari.</p>
<p><strong>from street - into workshop - hasari and owner</strong>: Two
plump men in shirt sleeves look coolly at Hasari. The elder shakes his
head. The younger shows Hasari the door.</p>
<p><strong>ext. bara bazar - day</strong>: Aloka huddled with Manooj and
Amrita. Hasari talking to the owner of a small market stall. Shambu is
peering into a shop with male mannequins in the window.</p>
<p><strong>int. men’s shop - moving mirror</strong>: In the moving
mirror we see counters and shelves of men’s clothing. The mirror stops
at Max slipping into a kurta before an audience of Ravi, Manubai, and a
salesman.</p>
<p><strong>ravi</strong>: It’s not extravagant at all. You can’t go
around all week in your tribal garb.</p>
<p><strong>ravi</strong>: Now he looks civilized, doesn’t he,
Manubai?</p>
<p><strong>manubai</strong>: Almost.</p>
<p><strong>ext. men’s shop - day</strong>: Man leans down, whispers to
the smiling boy…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You sure I look all right?</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: Shambu runs to his dejected
family.</p>
<p><strong>shambu</strong>: Look! A man gave me these many moneys!</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: What man? Why – did you ask him for
money?</p>
<p><strong>shambu</strong>: He just gave it to me.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: Don’t do that. We’re not beggars.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: Go back to the river. Wait for me by the
tree. Don’t go anywhere. Do you understand?</p>
<p><strong>ext. jute mill day - late afternoon sun</strong>: Starting to
sink. We PAN DOWN TO Hasari stepping to a grilled window as the man
ahead moves out.</p>
<p><strong>int. jute mill - day</strong>: A flaking gray wall,
half-obscured with moldering files. The grilled window lets in a little
light and the quiet supplications of those outside. An old CLERK at a
desk. A voice calls out. The Clerk looks up, crosses to the grill.
Hasari’s tense face through the bars. A TRUCK RUMBLES past, drowning out
the words… except these: “…trade union.” The Clerk shakes his head
sadly. On the verge of panic, Hasari hangs onto the window…</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Do you have family?</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: Yes, yes of course. But I’m three days
without work. I’ll take anything.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Here, now go away.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: No, I don’t want you to give me –</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: In this city, a man with a family can’t be
proud. Take it!</p>
<p><strong>int. chattergee reception room - day</strong>: Manubai’s
face. Then Max’s. Then hers. Then his. Looking at each other. Five days.
Kiss. Ravi.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I said you have three days to get me into bed,
and I’m betting you can’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>manubai</strong>: It’s all right for you to use my mother as
your tour guide and meal ticket, because she’ll get something nice out
of it. But what would I get?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Well, gee, I don’t know. Maybe I could say
something so amusing that you’d laugh so hard it would break that hot
poker you have up your ass.</p>
<p><strong>ravi</strong>: Staring at them, disappointment filling her
eyes.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: The same sound of frustration and ennui he made
in the ashram.</p>
<p><strong>ext. chattergee home - day</strong>: His arm around Max,
Veejay guides the young man toward a waiting taxi.</p>
<p><strong>veejay</strong>: Believe me, I understand, but you know how
women are. Do you have enough money?</p>
<p><strong>ext. green acres courtyard - cow - day</strong>: Bare feet…
and then sneakered feet step over the sleep- ing bovine, who turns a
disinterested eye up.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: Max is guided by a grumpy hall PORTER
wearing an off- white shirt and bellbottoms through the walled and well
planted courtyard of an inexpensive hotel. Max gives the cow a bemused
eye…</p>
<p><strong>int. hotel room - day</strong>: The room is utterly
utilitarian. The Porter turns on a ceiling fan, sending an army of
cockroaches scurrying for calmer terrain. Max clearly doesn’t care for
cockroaches.</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: It pleases you?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: No fruit basket? No mini bar?</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: Bar? Of course – many, many. But make care,
Sahib. Please, for me. If it is lady you like to know – yes? – you let
me. Huh? Very sweet girl, good nature, very sweet. Or boy, very
good…</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: No like boy? Something then for smoke –
mmmh, very good for smoke!</p>
<p><strong>at door</strong>: Max eases the Porter out. As the door is
closing…</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: Maybe you like two girls – look a little
Chinese, but very great pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: He stares at it… and startles us by
suddenly flicking out a hand and grabbing the blade, stopping the fan.
He lets go. The fan is still. He carries his knapsack to the tub; it has
brown stains along the middle and the water has a brown tinge as it
flows out of the tap. He sits on the edge of the tub, dumps his knapsack
on the floor, picks up a half-dozen pamphlets from the ashram.</p>
<p><strong>close on pamphlets</strong>: Guides to inner peace.</p>
<p><strong>resume</strong>: He wings the pamphlets at the trashcan.</p>
<p><strong>ext. riverbank - howrah bridge - day</strong>: Hasari comes
around the corner of a warehouse, a smile on his face, clutching some
bananas and dried grain. His relief – and ours – is short-lived.</p>
<p><strong>tree and bank</strong>: The space where he left the family
has been cleared and taken over by trucks. He’s lost his family.</p>
<p><strong>howrah bridge road</strong>: A group of Hindus are
celebrating a puja, the women singing canticles at the top of their
lungs; the men tossing a little boy happily back and forth… as the
panic-stricken Hasari rushes up.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: My wife, my children…</p>
<p><strong>under bridge - day</strong>: His head turns and his eyes look
this way, that way… until out of the near silence, we hear a distant,
extraordinary word…</p>
<p><strong>child</strong>: Daaaaaaddddddyyyyy!</p>
<p><strong>child</strong>: Daaaaaadddddddyyyy!</p>
<p><strong>shambu</strong>: Daaaaadddddyyyy!</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: I told you to remain where I left you! I
told you to stay there!</p>
<p><strong>manooj</strong>: The police came!</p>
<p><strong>shambu</strong>: We said we had to meet you, but they didn’t
care! They were mean!</p>
<p><strong>aloka</strong>: These friends have found space. They will
share with us.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: I would be proud if you would share our food
with us.</p>
<p><strong>ext. bridge - night</strong>: Distant transistor MUSIC as we
PAN DOWN: The Pal children sleep despite the QUIET MOANS and nightmare
CRIES around them, the two boys huddled together, Amrita close to her
mother. Hasari comes out of the dark. Aloka looks at him. He shakes his
head. He slumps beside her. Aloka strokes Hasari, looking lovingly at
him.</p>
<p><strong>aloka</strong>: I remember the first time I saw you, on the
day of our marriage. Wearing a bright yellow turban. You asked me my
name and you said, ‘You are a very beautiful girl and I am wondering
whether you will find me appealing.’</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: It’s all right – what?</p>
<p><strong>aloka</strong>: I miss the village. There I could help.</p>
<p><strong>ext. green acres - night</strong>: The sky turns red. The
Porter looks up, shakes his head: Poor young man, stuck with only a
trumpet for company.</p>
<p><strong>int. max’s room</strong>: Max sits on the floor in a corner
and plays as we hear the sound of a fierce WHISTLE and a SCREAMING
ENGINE.</p>
<p><strong>ext. settlement - close on bulldozer - dawn</strong>: A
gigantic earthmover lurches into position.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: Swarming police.</p>
<p><strong>pals</strong>: Awaken – startled, disoriented. Aloka gentles
the children as Hasari moves instinctively toward the threat.</p>
<p><strong>scene</strong>: A black ambassadorial car pulls up, out of
which steps a BABU. A microphone and speaker has been set up. Another
car unloads several politicos with party banners. A minion hands the
Babu the mike; he wants to get on with it before this turns into a
political rally. Hasari is close to him, as is Arun.</p>
<p><strong>babu</strong>: The municipality has directed us to carry out
the destruction of this settlement. All of you must go – now!</p>
<p><strong>arun</strong>: For what reason?</p>
<p><strong>babu</strong>: Because this settlement is impeding
construction work.</p>
<p><strong>arun</strong>: We’re not moving! Why should we move? Who is
the municipality? We are! This is our home!</p>
<p><strong>babu</strong>: I have my orders.</p>
<p><strong>arun</strong>: If we’re driven from here, where should we
go?</p>
<p><strong>babu</strong>: I’ll give you five minutes to gather your
things. Then, the settlement comes down.</p>
<p><strong>arun</strong>: Why should you alone be burdened with such a
task? Let me help!</p>
<p><strong>ext. church - close on billboard - day</strong>: On the
billboard: A maharajah sleeping snugly on a thick mattress. From his
dreamland he inquires solicitously: “Have you ever thought of a Rajah
Double Spring as a present?” We PAN DOWN and FIND the Pals and Arun and
his family, panting, terrified, beneath the sign.</p>
<p><strong>shambu</strong>: Daddy, are we going to die here?</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: No! Today, I’m just a mangy dog on the
street, but soon, I swear, I’ll look other men in the eye! I swear.</p>
<p><strong>ext. side of restaurant</strong>: Hasari reaches the head of
a line and receives a small handout. Turning away, he studies the morsel
of food. His head aches, his belly screams with hunger… but he takes
only a single bite, then carefully wraps the rest in a cloth and knots
it.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: He feels a tug at his elbow. It’s a
15-year-old BOY with thick, scholarly spectacles.</p>
<p><strong>rafik</strong>: Why live like a beggar when you can live like
a maharajah?</p>
<p><strong>int. blood dispensary - close on hasari’s arm - day</strong>:
A needle injected, blood flowing into a bottle.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: Hasari seated on a stool, watching
his blood leave his body, his face broken out in perspiration.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: I thought you were only taking a little.</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: We pay more, we take more.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: I’m feeling a little dizzy.</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: It’ll pass.</p>
<p><strong>hasari and nurse</strong>: With his free hand, he begins to
grapple for the Atten- dant to keep his balance, starts to fall… and
the</p>
<p><strong>ext. dispensary - day</strong>: A woozy Hasari gives Rafik
his share; Rafik in turn gives the thin man his share. The thin man bows
his farewell.</p>
<p><strong>rafik</strong>: Blood is the oil well of the poor, brother.
Now, give me another three and I’ll give you these.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: What are those?</p>
<p><strong>rafik</strong>: Vitamins. Take these and you can give again
in a week.</p>
<p><strong>rafik</strong>: One week. Here. The same time.</p>
<p><strong>int. max’s room - night</strong>: Max lies on his messed bed,
contorted, with his feet up over his head against the wall. A book lies
open beside him. A half-eaten room service meal, many hours old,
moulders on the bedside table. Max is babbling a mock sports case into
his fist…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: They’re in the shotgun. There’s the snap from
center, the clock is running – five, four, three – he has an open man at
the Notre Dame twenty for the victory… and he freezes. He freezes!
Mr. Choke chokes. The fans go –</p>
<p><strong>another angle - favoring max</strong>: The porter pushes the
girl gently into the room, smiling at Max, nodding. The door is
closed.</p>
<p><strong>max and poomina</strong>: He may have been receptive to a
“sweet, young girl,” but not a kid in her teens.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Got an I.D. on you? How old are you?</p>
<p><strong>poomina</strong>: Twenty, sahib.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I buy that.</p>
<p><strong>poomina</strong>: I can do anything you want, sahib.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Hold it, time out. Time, there’s time out on
the field.</p>
<p><strong>poomina</strong>: Is problems, sahib?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Is problems, yeah, just a couple.</p>
<p><strong>poomina</strong>: No, please, yes, I can –</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: How ’bout some chow? I was just about to order
some room service. Food. I call, they come, we eat.</p>
<p><strong>int. max’s room - night</strong>: Max smokes a Monte Cristo
and watches Poomina, like a frightened little animal, devour the last of
a Green Acres room service meal and then wrap a small piece of fish in
the paper napkin.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: She looks up at him, delivers a small
burp. Covers her mouth in charming embarrassment.</p>
<p><strong>poomina</strong>: Now, you are ready for great pleasure,
yes?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Watching you eat was my great pleasure. Now you
go home.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: For you.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You’re a very wet kisser. Work on it, get in
touch in five years.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Goddamn it, cut it out! Now, good night.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Five years already? Gee, time really flies when
you have no moral conviction.</p>
<p><strong>int. back alley - bar - flaming light - night</strong>: A
bare light bulb; a SCRATCHY vinyl RECORD on a turn- table.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Poomina watches Max do a sleight-of-hand
trick with a coin. He tosses it up, brings his hands past each other,
then holds out his fists; she picks on… but the other holds the penny.
Fooled, she laughs. He does it again; she points to one fist – empty –
then other – also empty. Max reaches behind her ear and… produces the
coin. She loves it, her laughter escalating. But then she seesm to read
something in the b.g. where we see four thugs, two of whom will become
known to us as THE GOONDA, a capo to the local “mafia” chieftan, and
ASHOKA, son of the local Godfather. Ashoka works on a pimple on his
chin. The Goonda meticulously cleans a spot of mud with spit from one of
his expensive new running shoes. Max eyes the thugs eyeing him.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Short guys! Quit lookin’ at us!</p>
<p><strong>poomina</strong>: Special drink for you, sahib. Only the most
man can drink it. You make try. For me.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: For you, I would drink battery acid.</p>
<p><strong>poomina</strong>: Who that finish first. I bet!</p>
<p><strong>poomina</strong>: I beat!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I really don’t think so – oh no, nay, nay! I
never lose the truly irrelevant contest.</p>
<p><strong>poomina</strong>: We have fun some more. I bet again!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: She turns to the bartender, calls for
two more. All the while, in the b.g., The Goonda and his two thugs watch
emotionlessly and Ashoka works on his acne.</p>
<p><strong>ext. bar - night</strong>: Max sings “Take It to the Limit”
with enormous inebriated sincerity as Poomina helps him out of the bar.
There’s a big black motorcycle parked outside. Max glances at it as they
start down the alley. As he looks back to the road ahead, he finds The
Goonda in front of him. Max isn’t so drunk that he doesn’t sense what
this is about. He looks behind him. Indeed, the other two goons are
there. Ashoka straddles the big cycle.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Well well. Seek punishment and ye shall
find.</p>
<p><strong>ext. maharajah sign - night</strong>: The Pals sleep beneath
the sign. Hasari awakens from restive sleep to the sound of a FIGHT. He
gets up. The others awaken.</p>
<p><strong>arun</strong>: Don’t go – what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: It sounds like someone needs help.</p>
<p><strong>alleyway</strong>: As Hasari turns into the head of the
alley, he can see three men beating someone, a fourth man standing off
to the side, watching.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: What are you doing? A man’s being beaten
here!</p>
<p><strong>hasari and max</strong>: Hasari runs up, reaches out to Max,
who’s barely on his feet. As Hasari touches Max, Max turns and belts
Hasari in the nose, nailing Hasari to the wall as Max collapses at
Hasari’s feet. Hasari grabs his nose with one hand and kneels beside the
fallen Max… as a shadow moves and startles Hasari. He peers into the
dark… and Poomina steps into the light.</p>
<p><strong>- day</strong>: The crucifix sways. Now Max’s eyes RACK FOCUS
TO the cherubic face of JOAN BETHAL, peering AT the CAMERA without
sympathy.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: Max on a cot in a tiny, spare room, a
butterfly bandage under one eye. Joan, Irish, short, stout, hovers over
him. Behind her, Hasari Pal.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Good morning, junior, welcome to our
country.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Oh, I like the way the room moves in circles. I
suppose I should inquire where I am.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: You’re in the City of Joy.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Is that geographic or spiritual?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Oh, now we require that each visitor decide
that for himself. This gentleman and a young lady brought you here.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Did I do that to your nose? I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Hasari shrugs, smiles… and a gigantic
rat drops in Max’s lap. He leaps to his feet and against the wall. The
rat scurries away.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What was that – a Shetland pony?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: I would have to inspect it more closely, but I
believe that was one of our economy-size rats.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Watch your –</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Thanks – got it.</p>
<p><strong>ext. clinic/school - nizamudhin lane - max’s face</strong>:
Stunned.</p>
<p><strong>square</strong>: In the dawn light, he finds himself in a
small square in a slum, an open sewer running before him. He’s
repulsed.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Pardon the expression, but Jesus H. Christ.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: … to find perhaps fifty people,
largely women and children, staring at him.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: He knows them by type: patients. He
looks at the sign on the door.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You a doctor?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Oh no, I’m a corporate executive. Doctor
arrives at half seven, but only three days a week.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: This is obviously one of those three days.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Indeed. What brings you to our country?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I came to find my white light.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Ah, yes. I take it you didn’t find it.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Kept opening the doors and windows of my
spirit, but couldn’t see a goddamn thing.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: What do you do in America?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Oh, how exciting. Must be something illegal.
Are you a criminal of some sort?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I suppose that depends how you define the word:
I’m a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: I see. How long are you here? Perhaps I could
recruit you for –</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Forget it. You’ve got your non- practicing
Catholics. I’m a non- practicing doctor.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: How very distressing. Why’s that?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Found out I just really don’t like sick people.
Well, I’m outta here. I owe you one.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: I can’t imagine ever divining how to collect,
but there are a few of us Indians, you know, who believe the tourist
trade ought to be encouraged.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Thank you very much. Let me…</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: No, please.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: I’m afraid they cleaned you out. Ram, here’s
your first rider. Take this.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Go on, it’s all right. You’ll owe me two.</p>
<p><strong>ext. street - flying feet - day</strong>: Max in the
rickshaw, Hasari running alongside Ram, an exuberant smile slashed
across his face.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: You see, I can keep up.</p>
<p><strong>ram</strong>: Keep up, of course. Anyone can run at this
pace. But you think it’s easy to run and to pull?</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: I can do it. I could pull it.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Come on, give him a shot. He’s as fast as you
and looks twice as strong.</p>
<p><strong>ram</strong>: Will you still pay me when he runs you into a
ditch?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Absolutely. I trust the man.</p>
<p><strong>ram</strong>: All right, you, come, step in here.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I hope you’re taking something for that.</p>
<p><strong>ram</strong>: Now, fine, pull, go.</p>
<p><strong>ram</strong>: See, mister! What did I tell you? Come on! What
do you think this is – some village street? You’ve got to move
quickly.</p>
<p><strong>ram</strong>: You see, it takes a gift.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I say he can do it. I’ll bet you the fare he
can do it. What do you think, rickshaw fans, can he do it?</p>
<p><strong>int. godfather’s house - day</strong>: At first all we see
are feet on a marble floor. The Goonda’s in his running shoes, then Ram
and Hasari’s bare feet. This is the partitioned splendor of an old house
sprinkled with the relics of a grand colonial past. Everything is
baroque, rotting and somehow impressive. Hasari has never been anywhere
like this, and is caught between curiosity and fear of breathing.</p>
<p><strong>int. “throne room”</strong>: The three men enter a large room
shuttered from the sun- light – dusty and packed with a ramshackle
assortment of furniture. Two fat blue titmice perch in a cage next to
ambitious plaster portrait of Napolean. Sitting behind a desk is Ashoka,
leaning over a mirror, squeezing a balky pimple. Near a large window,
his 60-year-old father, GHATAK, in a European jacket and dhoti, works
with intense concen- tration at repairing a pair of broken glasses with
a twist of fine wire. The three new arrivals stand silent and respectful
before the desk. At last, without raising his head…</p>
<p><strong>ashoka</strong>: Not a tongue between you then?</p>
<p><strong>ram</strong>: Yes, yes, I am wondering, sir, we are, is it
possible you might have something for my friend?</p>
<p><strong>ram</strong>: Let me explain it for your ears, sir. My cousin
from Bihar has just arrived in our city –</p>
<p><strong>goonda</strong>: They’ve brought a small present – of
respect.</p>
<p><strong>ashoka</strong>: So, you want to be a human horse?</p>
<p><strong>ram</strong>: Oh yes! I have personally witnessed his
excellence – yes.</p>
<p><strong>ashoka</strong>: He doesn’t talk? Can he neigh at least? You
– do your ears function?</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: Oh yes, Babu. Can I… uhm…?</p>
<p><strong>ashoka</strong>: Neigh! Like a horse.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: Well, yes, Babu, I can do that. Would you
like me to imitate a horse?</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: Behind him, The Godfather walks up to
the desk, putting his glasses on. He barely glances at his son, but
waves him out of the chair. Ashoka doesn’t like it, but he steps aside.
As he does, he turns a look of hatred on Hasari. Through no fault of his
own, Hasari has made an enemy. Ghatak chews on a pan and casts a
benevolent eye on Hasari.</p>
<p><strong>ghatak</strong>: Lift your longhi.</p>
<p><strong>ghatak</strong>: The wise men of our nation say that nirvana
is the attainment of a state of supreme detachment. For me, nirvana is
counting each evening, one by one, the rupees earned by my two thousand
and forty-six rickshaws.</p>
<p><strong>ghatak</strong>: You are with family?</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: I have a wife and three children, Babu.</p>
<p><strong>ghatak</strong>: And they must eat, heh. The world is full of
open mouths.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: I shall be eternally grateful to you. From
now on, I shall be as the youngest of your brothers.</p>
<p><strong>ghatak</strong>: Stay loyal. These days, it’s a crop nobody
plants.</p>
<p><strong>ext. mattress sign - day</strong>: Transitor MUSIC. The Pals
load the rickshaw that stands at the road with Ram in it. There are
embraces with the bruised Arun and his family.</p>
<p><strong>ext. square - night</strong>: We hear the BELL TINKLING as
the rickshaw, pulled by Hasari, carrying Ram and Aloka arrives . Surya,
Selima, other neighbors greet them as they come. The Pals glance into
the school at Joan, who’s teaching an evening class.</p>
<p><strong>with pals</strong>: Reverentially, they follow Ram inside as
Joan watches.</p>
<p><strong>int. ram’s hut - night</strong>: A door opens. Moonlight.
Faces peer through the door. Ram lights an oil lamp. In the glow, the
family looks around their tiny space. Hardly able to suppress
smiles.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: Someone has blessed us. A job, a roof, a
school. Soon I’ll be able to send money home… … and put away a little
bit for your dowry.</p>
<p><strong>outside</strong>: and up to the roof, under the stars. We
LOOK UP WITH them and:</p>
<p><strong>ext. green acres - on sky - night</strong>: PAN DOWN TO Max
on his balcony playing his trumpet as we continue to</p>
<p><strong>ext. square and street - day</strong>: About twenty tattered
street kids faces shining with en- joyment. They run and shout as they
pursue something just out of frame.</p>
<p><strong>wide shot</strong>: The cause of the excitement is Hasari
running TOWARD us, feet flying, as he pulls the rickshaw, loaded with a
huge sack. Manooj and Shambu are clinging to the sides of the machine.
Ram stands in the center of the square. He shouts a command and Hasari
struggles to bring the rickshaw to a stop. It’s not easy and Sunil –
who’s arriving – has to jump out of the way to the accompaniment of
apologies from Hasari and Ram and hoots of laughter from the children.
Outside the clinic, a line of perhaps seventy-five wait patiently,
watching as Hasari takes off again. The wheels of the rickshaw hit a
rut. Hasari loses control, the sack tips back and Hasari is lifted into
the air, feet kicking as he tries to regain his balance. Aloka and
Amrita, sitting near the bawling Ram, can’t hold back their
laughter.</p>
<p><strong>ext. square - high angle - day</strong>: The square is set
with obstacles. As Ram shouts instruc- tion, we see Hasari negotiate
them with much increased skill. He stops in front of a small group. It’s
his family, plus Joan and Surya. With an exhausted smile, he signs to
Aloka and Amrita to get in. They do, and Hasari takes them triumphantly
around the circuit.</p>
<p><strong>high angle</strong>: Hasari’s triumphant ride continues and
we:</p>
<p><strong>ext. park street - day</strong>: Hasari rubs the moonstone in
his ring on the shafts, then touches his heart and his forehead. A
SCHOOL GIRL in uniform, approaches the rickshaw stand. We also see
several other pullers, Rassoul, Chomotkar, Ramatullah.</p>
<p><strong>school girl</strong>: Rickshaw wallah!</p>
<p><strong>ram</strong>: Let Hasari go!</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: I’m sorry, I don’t know where that is.
You’re my very first passenger.</p>
<p><strong>school girl</strong>: Really. Well, I hope I bring you
luck.</p>
<p><strong>school girl</strong>: That way, and then to the right.</p>
<p><strong>ram</strong>: Feed the police!</p>
<p><strong>ext. st. pius - day</strong>: The School Girl hands him a
slip of paper.</p>
<p><strong>school girl</strong>: This is my home address. Pick me up
promptly at seven each morning.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: Yes, thank you, you can depend on me.</p>
<p><strong>int. small restaurant - day</strong>: Max is trying to
explain to the waiter what he wants.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Beef. You know – cow? Minced, little salt,
pepper, slap it flat like this, throw it on the grill, flip it.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Put it on the grill, I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>with ashoka</strong>: He pulls the boy’s ear, REVS the ENGINE
to go… and senses someone close. He turns to find an American hovering
at his shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You know, I have to say you really don’t look
Jewish. I believe that’s mine.</p>
<p><strong>ashoka</strong>: Don’t touch me. No one touches me.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>several cuts</strong>: Ashoka, glancing back, begins to open
up some distance. Yet, Max hangs tough, weaving like a broken field
runner through the mass of bodies and vehicles. Now, suddenly, he loses
Ashoka. He has to make a choice about this corner or that one. He
chooses.</p>
<p><strong>ext. city of joy - around corner - day</strong>: A COP steps
into his path. He sees Ashoka up ahead. He’s hopelessly out of
breath.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Oh… great… good…good timing …him!</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: May I see your passport?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Passport? I’m in the middle of a high speed
chase. That guy –</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Passport please.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: It’s in my hotel room.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Passport, please, now.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Ready my lips: I do not have my passport with
me at this… Ah, I see, said the blind man.</p>
<p><strong>another angle - favoring owner of hand</strong>: The girls
with the cricket equipment . The hand belongs to Joan Bethel.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Well, all right, junior, so you’ll owe me
three.</p>
<p><strong>ext. post office - day</strong>: A scribe finishes writing a
note home for Hasari. The scribe hands it to Hasari.</p>
<p><strong>resume</strong>: With great pride, Hasari pays the scribe,
seals the money order with the message in an envelope, licks the flap,
and puts the envelope into the mail slot.</p>
<p><strong>ext. square - tea shop - day</strong>: Surya plays his
zither. Max and Joan sit at a table. Max pops little boiled candies into
his mouth from a dish on the table.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Oh, it was just a whim in the beginning really
– to try to convince them not to be so bloody passive, that they could
pull themselves up on their own. I get a little money from a Swiss
organization. Now it’s become a bit more than I can manage.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: It’s got to be like trying to drill a hole in
water, though.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: We just need a few more hands on this little
life raft we’ve set afloat here.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: They stare at each other. Shambu has
become one of Surya’s tea boys and refills their tea.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: You know what I’ve come to think in my middle
age, Max?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Nope, no, earthly idea. You’re pretty much
outta my league, thought-wise.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: There are really only three actions open to a
person.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Only three – okay. And what are they?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: To run, to spectate, to commit.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Has it occurred to you that this obsession with
charity is really a flaw in your character?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Charity! It’s not charity, dear child, it’s
love. You’re very badly twisted around, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: One of us sure as hell is.</p>
<p><strong>sunil</strong>: I’m off for home, Sister Joan. A pleasure to
meet you, Dr. Loeb.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: The same.</p>
<p><strong>sunil</strong>: See you day after tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Good night, God bless, Doctor. Generous young
man.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: As he watches Sunil head away, Max
senses something com- ing at him from the side. A soccer ball almost
hits him; he jumps up, handles the ball athletically.</p>
<p><strong>square</strong>: He begins to play with Manooj and several
other children. Shambu leaves his post in the tea shop to join them.</p>
<p><strong>manooj</strong>: Are you the American doctor? Are you coming
here to help us.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: No, I’m the visiting American soccer star, El
Max.</p>
<p><strong>manooj</strong>: Do you go to the cinema in America, El
Max?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: When I was your age – two movies, plus cartoons
every Saturday.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: There you go, little guy. Ut – what’s this?</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: Ram and Hasari return home. Hasari
can hardly walk. Shambu runs to his father, explaining excitedly…</p>
<p><strong>shambu</strong>: Daddy, there is the doctor from America. He
saw two movies every Saturday. What’s in your fist? Open, Daddy!</p>
<p><strong>shambu</strong>: Seeds? Why?</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: So we can watch something grow.</p>
<p><strong>ext. ram’s hunt night - upstairs</strong>: Children leaning
down as smoke wafts up. We FOLLOW the smoke DOWN TO Max’s cigar. Aloka
and Amrita laying the food out. Shambu rubbing his father’s aching legs
as Hasari and Manooj plant the seeds in Hasari’s little tea caddy full
of earth from home. Max is watching this “family” huddled around the
father.</p>
<p><strong>ram</strong>: Another few months, I’ll be able to pay off the
moneylender in my village and go home and open a grocery shop. All
around me sacks overflowing with all kinds of dal and rice, aromatic
spices, piles of vegetables… and at night, I’ll lie on my back beneath
the trees sniffing fresh aubergines.</p>
<p><strong>ram</strong>: If my wife will let me come within a hundred
miles of the place where she herself resides.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: Amrita, I saw a beautiful wedding sari
today.</p>
<p><strong>ram</strong>: It was six hundred rupees only.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: That’s only 40 dollars, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: If you have it.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’ll send it to you from America when I get
home tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: That’s very generous but no, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Repayment for punching you in the nose.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: You have repaid me by sharing our
supper.</p>
<p><strong>ram</strong>: Doctor Big Brother, I myself would be willing
to accept a gift. Could you give me five rupees in a note – ten,
perhaps. My ankle is badly swelled; the higher the number the more the
swelling sinks.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I don’t have a cent on me. I’ll owe you.</p>
<p><strong>ram</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: It’s an amazing sight. Two lepers:
ANOUAR, bearded with a sharp intelligent, unmarked face, makes his way
along on a small wheeled board, at an amazingly fast pace, ahead of
SAID, a huge, mute leper. They stop some feet away. Lepers aren’t often
welcome. Out from behind Said steps Poomina.</p>
<p><strong>poomina</strong>: Joan Di, my sister!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: She sees Max, gasps, throws herself
behind Said. Joan looks at Max – he starts to speak, she points a finger
that silences him…</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: It was Poomina who brought you to us. She has
herself and her sister to support. It’s all right, Poomina. Anouar, what
is it?</p>
<p><strong>anouar</strong>: It’s Meeta! It’s her time. But something is
wrong. The midwives don’t know what to do! Dr. Sunil, could he help,
perhaps?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Dr. Sunil isn’t here.</p>
<p><strong>poomina</strong>: Meeta will die.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: Joan turns to Max, who hasn’t heard
the exchange.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Max, I wouldn’t ask, but it’s an emergency. A
pregnancy gone awry. It’s a leper. Could you have a look?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I don’t have any experience with leprosy.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Good Christ, son, because she’s a leper
doesn’t mean she’s not built like a woman!</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: I can run and get Dr. Sunil.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: It’s too far.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Suddenly, impulsively…</p>
<p><strong>aloka</strong>: I could help. I’ve had three babies.</p>
<p><strong>ram</strong>: You can’t do that. They’re outcasts, they’re
unclean.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Oh nonsense! It’s not contagious!</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: You’re a doctor, how can you not help?</p>
<p><strong>ext. path-night</strong>: The moon reflects off the dark
puddles of muddy water that line the side of the railway tracks. Anouar
propels his board with astonishing agility along the path, Said and
Poomina running with him. Max, Joan, carrying a first aid bag, Aloka and
Hasari following, slipping and sliding on the rough ground with its
puddles and sewage.</p>
<p><strong>ext. railway line - leper huts - night</strong>: The little
procession arrives outside the three rough huts, made of bamboo, plastic
sheeting, cloth, wood and cardboard. A few shadows materialize. Lepers –
staring silently. Anouar points into a hut. Joan and Aloka precede Max
inside. Max forgets to bend and bumps his head.</p>
<p><strong>int. hut - night</strong>: The only light is the feeble waver
from a candle. The blind Meeta lies on a rough mattress on the ground.
Her ragged sari is pulled up to her middle. Her face runs with sweat,
her hair is plastered to her face. A girl with black eyes is fanning her
with a piece of wood. Meeta sends up a SOFT, uninterrupted MOAN. A wedge
of blood-soaked cloth is between her legs.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: A middle-age leper is leaning over her –
a midwife, encouraging Meeta with a string of commands in their own
language. Max kneels, Aloka at his side. His breathing becomes shallow…
but then he pulls off the blood-soaked bandages. Between Meeta’s legs he
can just make out the bottom of a foot. The child is breached. Maybe
already dead.</p>
<p><strong>aloka</strong>: Will she die?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Pull me two c.c.’s of Coramine.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Uh-oh, uh-oh, who’s this coming’ down the lane?
Why it’s – is it possible – way over here, in India – yes, it’s
Mr. Choke.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’m going to have to turn it – the baby. Tell
her she has to relax these muscles as much as she can.</p>
<p><strong>outside</strong>: A small group waits, trying to determine
from the sounds what’s happening inside. Anouar pours tea from a pot on
the small fire, offers the cup to Hasari. Hasari stares at the cup,
doesn’t want to be impolite, but more than that, doesn’t want to touch
the cup. He shakes his head, smiles. Anouar drinks off the tea.</p>
<p><strong>inside</strong>: Sweat pours down Max’s face into his eyes.
He shakes it out. Aloka leans forward and, with her new sari, wipes the
sweat away again. Max nods thanks.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Tell her again to breathe in short little
bursts now.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: All right! Now, tell her to push.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Again. Yes! Again. It’s coming.</p>
<p><strong>outside</strong>: No one is sitting now. Everyone hangs close
to the door. Only Hasari remains apart, seated on a tree stump in the
middle of the quad. He coughs; suppresses it.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’ve got the head. Come on, little baby, come
on, little baby. Be alive, be alive, be alive.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: We’ve got it, we’ve got it. Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: He seems as released as Meeta. Then he
gives a last gentle tug and a CRY squeezes out of the little piece of
life in his hands. Max is fairly overwhelmed by the life in his hands.
Poomina steps close, a smile on her lovely face, and touches the baby in
Max’s hands.</p>
<p><strong>ext. lane - night</strong>: Max, Joan, Aloka and Hasari walk
in silence down Nizamudhin Lane. There is only the mingled sound of
COUGHING, MOANING, and a TRANSISTOR RADIO nearby playing a popular song.
Outside the clinic, they stop. She takes his hand.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: For a non-practicing doctor, that was pretty
practiced.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Never been so scared in my life.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Max, please, won’t you change your mind? We
desperately need another doctor. Full-time. Think about it – just give
us a couple of months.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Can’t do it. Maybe you’ve got it in you to be a
saint. I just don’t.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Then what do you want? What are you going to
be when you grow up? Good night, Aloka, Hasari.</p>
<p><strong>aloka</strong>: Thank you for allowing me to go with you.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You could make a helluva nurse.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: I think perhaps you are a good man.</p>
<p><strong>ext./int. joan’s and the pal’s - night</strong>: Max hears
Joan praying inside.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Jesus, my brother, you who I am trying to
believe are the light and salvation of the puking world …</p>
<p><strong>the pals</strong>: Aloka sits huddled with her husband while
their children sleep; they listen…</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Please see that we are living in madness and
darkness here…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: listens.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: … and we need help. Om, Jesus, om and
amen.</p>
<p><strong>ext. calcutta airport - establishing - day</strong>: A busy,
urban airport as opposed to the small country airport in which we saw
Max earlier. V.O. we hear…</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Yes, yes, yes, that’s right, yes! I turned in
your ticket!</p>
<p><strong>int. airport - day</strong>: It’s a small place; it’s
sweltering, and it’s packed with hundreds of families shoulder to
shoulder. Though Betsy’s trying to be discreet, it’s not a very private
place, as we see by the number of people watching Max and Betsy.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I bought it, I got a refund!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: But I want to go home with you.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: You want to go home with me?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Then prove it.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Good – how – name it.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Buy yourself a ticket.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I would love to do that, Betsy Ilene, boy would
I love to do just that, but I’m financially embarrassed at the –</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Use your credit cards.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What credit cards? You know I maxed them before
we left. Just lend me –</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: No! You won’t pay me back; you never have.
Oh, Max!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: They’re calling our flight. I want to go home
with you, Betsy Ilene Kahn. Because I have a vision. It’s…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I see you and me, Betsy Ilene Kahn, nibbling
toward each other through a quarter pounder with cheese, chugalugging a
frosty light beer – great taste! Less filling! Bowling! I want to go
bowling, Besty Ilene Kahn!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I want… Oh, my Lord Amighty, I want so many
American things –</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Oh, stop it! You have no earthly idea what
you want, Max! And stop calling me Betsy Ilene Kahn.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Isn’t that your name?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: You call me Betsy Ilene Kahn like you just
met me yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What should I call you? My girl, my significant
other –</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Don’t get cute! You get cute and I swear to
God — you told me once I look like my mother!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You do – so what?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: See – you don’t understand!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: How could I possibly not understand a
conversation as easy as this one, Betsy Ilene.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I hate you!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Na ya don’t.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I stood by you for three years!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I supported you through your internship!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You did.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Why? It was never working. What have I been
thinking all these years – that you’d change? You’re the most
self-pitying, self-destructive, self…</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: But you’ve taught me something, Max. You
never finish anything. Well, I quit. I’ve found my light and I’m free of
you.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Will you at least call my mother and ask her to
empty my savings account and wire –</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Do it yourself, Max. Call her collect. You
should have called her weeks ago anyway just because she’s your mother!
White light, white light…!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Guerilla theater, folks. ‘All the world’s a
stage.’ Don’t know if that word reached you here yet. If you’d care to
show your appreciation by a small donation…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Aw, what the hell.</p>
<p><strong>ext. square - day</strong>: The line is long. At this moment,
Joan is checking a child’s throat with a tongue-depressor. Aloka is
walking beside her with a fistful of depressors and a bag for disposal.
Hasari and Ram are getting ready to leave. Anouar appears at Joan’s
waist.</p>
<p><strong>anouar</strong>: Good morning, Joan Di. Dr. Loeb said many of
us could be helped; that all it would take is money for medication.</p>
<p><strong>anouar</strong>: Please buy the medication for us. If we
cannot come here to receive it, perhaps Dr. Loeb would come to us.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: I’ll be happy to buy the medication, but
Dr. Loeb is not part of this endeavor, Anouar; there is only his
cherished memory.</p>
<p><strong>anouar</strong>: Then perhaps I am having visions.</p>
<p><strong>their pov</strong>: Max approaches. A buzz about Max’s
heroics; hands coming together. Max raises a hand in benediction, makes
the sign of the cross. Max claps Hasari on the shoulder; Hasari brings
his hands together and gives Max a genuinely pleased smile. Children
circle and touch him, Manooj and Shambu among them.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Good morning! Good morning! Heckuva morning!
Getting ready to practice medicine without a license, Sister Joan? You
don’t see me soliciting conversions, do you?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Well, well, well, I do so love to be
surprised.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Okay, for starters, pick me out someone with
something easy I can heal, make me look good. Aloka, you’re my
assistant, let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Max, knock it off, give us a bit of hush. What
happened?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I changed my mind.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: And I’m a bloody bathing beauty.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Okay, so I got left.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Smart girl… So how long am I stuck with
you?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Two weeks – or until Mom sends me a ticket.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Not worth the aggravation of your prattle
every day. Six months – and not a day less.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: No way. Six weeks – and that’s my best
offer.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Two months – and that’s my final offer.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Done.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Jesus and Mary. The Lone Ranger rides
again.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Watch your –</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Thanks – got it.</p>
<p>****: The wheels spinning furiously and then stopping abruptly.
Hasari, dripping with sweat, panting. The School Girl comes running
toward him. After her, in the b.g., her</p>
<p><strong>school girl</strong>: Hasari, where have you been? I’ve been
waiting almost five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: I’m sorry, forgive me. It won’t happen
again.</p>
<p><strong>school girl</strong>: We’re not going to school today. You’re
taking my mother and me to the Bara Bazar. I’m getting married!</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: Oh, I am so pleased for you!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Good morning, Hasari.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: Good morning, missus.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Turn right at that corner, Hasari.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: It’s farther that way, missus.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: No, not really. Turn there, please.</p>
<p><strong>ext. second wedding shop - day</strong>: He helps them out of
the rickshaw in front of an expensive-looking bridal shop.</p>
<p><strong>school girl</strong>: You must remember this shop, Hasari,
when it’s your daughter’s time. This is the nicest in the city.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Don’t say things like that. He’s never going
to be able to buy anything here.</p>
<p><strong>on hasari</strong>: He watches from outside, a look of
determination coming over his face. Suddenly a pair of fingers takes
hold of his ear, twisting his face painfully.</p>
<p><strong>ashoka</strong>: Not working? How will my father eat this
evening?</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: I was just…</p>
<p><strong>ashoka</strong>: You have a daughter?</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: Yes, Babu.</p>
<p><strong>marwari</strong>: Rickshaw wallah!</p>
<p><strong>ashoka</strong>: Keep working. Give this to Sister Joan and
your friend the doctor when you go home.</p>
<p><strong>int. examining room - day</strong>: Max with his stethoscope
to Meeta’s baby. Meeta in a brightly-colored sari and a lot of bracelets
and Aloka looks on. Poomina clings to the wall.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: He’s just malnourished. Is she giving him the
milk we gave her or selling it?</p>
<p><strong>aloka</strong>: Not all. Most.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Tell her to give all the milk to the baby.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Psst.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>ext. square - day</strong>: Sunil stands outside the clinic,
rolling his sleeves down. Anouar waits at a polite distance. Exhausted
but exhilarated, Max and Aloka emerge with an elderly woman patient, Max
singing Chuck Berry to the woman’s embar- rassed delight: “They’re
really rockin’ in Boston, in Philadelphia, P.A…” Sunil looks at his
American colleague, smiles a small smile.</p>
<p><strong>sunil</strong>: Good night, I’ll see you day after
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Good night, Sunil.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: “… Deep in the heart of Texas, around
the Frisco Bay…” Manooj and Shambu come charging at Max with the soccer
ball, hoping to engage him as a playmate. Hasari returns home with his
rickshaw. Selima waves at Max, indicates she’s cooking dinner. Joan
wanders out of the school as the kids are released and go charging
through the square. Joan has the Pal kids in hand.</p>
<p><strong>selima</strong>: Very special supper for you tonight, Doctor
Big Brother! Will you stay?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Wish I could, Selima, because I’m sure hungry!
Sixteen hours of pestilence and misery always make me famished. I have
to go with my man Anouar tonight. I’ve got lepers to heal!</p>
<p><strong>anouar</strong>: No, no, you know how patient we are. Eat,
eat.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You’re not tired, are you?</p>
<p><strong>aloka</strong>: Not if you’re not.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Well, I think we’ve got three very good
potential scholars here.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Given him some time here, he’ll be good enough
for a proper school.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: It’s more than a father could hope.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Fifteen years from now: Miami, Florida,
Dr. Manooj Pal, in association with Dr. Maxwell Loeb.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: From the godfather’s son. For you and the
doctor.</p>
<p><strong>int. godfather’s “throne room” - old radio - day</strong>:
The MUSIC is of days gone by, playing on an old RADIO. Sticks of burning
incense send off trails of smoke. The godfather, MR. GHATAK, Looking
infirm, wipes a tear from his eye.</p>
<p><strong>ghatak</strong>: Acha!</p>
<p><strong>ashoka</strong>: You!</p>
<p><strong>ghatak</strong>: I understand that you’re interested in
expanding your clinic and free school, and that you intend to start
treating lepers in the City of Joy.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: We’d like to better serve the entire
community, Mr. Ghatak.</p>
<p><strong>ghatak</strong>: Of course. That’s very good. Admirable. And
we’d be pleased to rent you suitable space. But you must understand that
certain payments will go up.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: I understand the rent would have to go up if
we rent larger quarters from you, Mr. Ghatak, but why should we have to
pay more protection?</p>
<p><strong>ghatak</strong>: More people, more potential trouble.
Strangers. If I don’t charge you, what will I tell others?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: But we can’t afford it!</p>
<p><strong>ghatak</strong>: Surely if you can expand, you can pay
more.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Am I stupid, but isn’t this protection money
money we’re paying you to protect us from you?</p>
<p><strong>ghatak</strong>: We live in chaotic times, Miss Bethel,
Doctor. I control the City of Joy and maintain it as a model of harmony.
It’s a miracle, but a very fragile miracle.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: And how are we threatening your miracle?</p>
<p><strong>ghatak</strong>: I admire your courage in choosing to work in
such a violent place, Miss Bethel.</p>
<p><strong>ghatak</strong>: Your neighbors in the City of Joy, they’re
not educated, they’re given to violence, to meanness, I can promise you
they won’t like having lepers among them, but because they know you’re
under my protection…</p>
<p><strong>ghatak</strong>: Doctor, do you like our music?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Well, I can’t say I’ve developed a craving for
it yet.</p>
<p><strong>ghatak</strong>: It’s difficult to appreciate what we don’t
understand, isn’t it? Let me put it another way: The world is a terrible
place. Only the ruthless prevail. My son will make the arrangements with
you.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I like your taste in neckwear.</p>
<p><strong>ashoka</strong>: The entire package we’re proposing will cost
you three thousand rupees a month.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: If we pay you that, we won’t have any money
for supplies.</p>
<p><strong>ashoka</strong>: I’m told you’re very resourceful.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I think I see a solution. May I? What if we
were to work out a profit-sharing arrangement? We give you a share of
our net profit.</p>
<p><strong>ashoka</strong>: How do you expect to make a profit off of
lepers and the poor, Doctor?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Beats the hell outta me, asshole. But you’ve
obviously found a way.</p>
<p><strong>ext. godfather’s house - day</strong>: Joan is furious.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Have you gone right off your rocker!? These
people don’t have a sense of humor. Are you trying to get yourself
killed?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I don’t think so… but with me, any duplicity is
possible.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Stop it, you… you… you nudnick!</p>
<p><strong>int. metal piecework shop - day</strong>: It’s dark and
claustrophobic. The air vibrates with the SQUEAL and CLATTER of METAL.
About twenty kids sit in a line, back to back, manipulating aseries of
lethal and unprotected lathes and polishers. No one can hear his
neighbor.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: Hasari, with Shambu in the rickshaw,
arrives to take the children home. As he looks inside, he notices…</p>
<p><strong>hasari’s pov</strong>: Not far from Amrita sits a handsome
boy . He catches Amrita’s eyes. Amrita is sweetly embarrassed to find
her father staring at her.</p>
<p><strong>on hasari</strong>: But he can’t help but smile. At the same
time he’s re- minded moment to moment of his various obligations.</p>
<p><strong>ext. side street - day</strong>: The three kids in the
rickshaw. An ambassador car swerves in front of Hasari, forcing him to
jam to a stop, jolting the kids. The Goonda sits in the back seat with
Ashoka, who carves his fingernails with a switchblade knife. He crooks a
finger at Hasari. Hasari leans close and Ashoka takes him by the
ear.</p>
<p><strong>ashoka</strong>: Who gave you your rickshaw?</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: The Godfather.</p>
<p><strong>ashoka</strong>: Who provides the food you eat?</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: The Godfather.</p>
<p><strong>ashoka</strong>: Remember: Loyalty.</p>
<p><strong>ext. joan’s room - kids - above - night</strong>: Leaning
over, listening, taking in the aroma of…</p>
<p><strong>int. joan’s room</strong>: Max’s cigar. He sits slightly
apart from Joan, Sunil, Aloka, Ram, Hasari, Selima, Margareta, Surya,
SALADDIN, ASHISH and Shanta, Aristotle John, MEHBOUB, Anouar, and Said.
Hasari is stretched out, Aloka rubbing his screaming legs. Throughout
the following, their eyes meet and deflect…</p>
<p><strong>saladdin</strong>: The Godfather is at least civilized. The
son is vicious. Remember the last elections – the Molotov coctails, the
blows with iron bars. They’ll throw us out. We won’t be able to find
anyone else to rent to us. We’ll just have to agree to pay what he
wants.</p>
<p><strong>mehboub</strong>: Saladdin’s right. Neither nature nor the
people with the power have any conscience. We have to pay.</p>
<p><strong>ashish</strong>: What do you say, Doctor Big Brother?</p>
<p><strong>sunil</strong>: I think we must try to break the Godfather’s
hold on us.</p>
<p><strong>sunil</strong>: Please, hear me out. But I think we have to
be very cautious.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: How the hell do you proceed with caution
against these people? You can’t. You have to risk everything.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You try to negotiate with these people, you
make compromises with them, they’ll eat you alive. Stand up against them
now and they’ll fold. I guarantee it. Underneath, they’re cowards, they
got no guts. We show them we’re strong and the’ll just move on to easier
pickings.</p>
<p><strong>ashish</strong>: We? You have an airplane ticket.</p>
<p><strong>sunil</strong>: You know, Max, this is not American gangster
television.</p>
<p><strong>saladdin</strong>: Yes, if you’re wrong, you don’t have to be
here.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’m not wrong. You bow your heads, you plead
with your Gods to do what you won’t do yourselves. You put up with this
nightmare as if there were no choice. I’m telling you, if you don’t
stand up to that little pimple face now, he’ll own you for the rest of
your lives.</p>
<p><strong>anouar</strong>: Even though I am invisible to some of you
and I don’t have a complete set of legs to stand on, I stand with the
Doctor Big Brother. Maybe nature doesn’t have a conscience or those with
the power, but don’t we?</p>
<p><strong>margareta</strong>: I agree with Anouar and Max Daddah. I
think it’s worth the chance.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: Is it permitted to speak?</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: I want my children to be educated and cared
for; this is our home, we have never had such friends. But many of us
owe a great debt to the Godfather. He is strong and could kill us… But
we must choose. I trust my Big Brother. I say we must stand up.</p>
<p><strong>sunil</strong>: Sister Joan, what do you think, really?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Well, I think Max has hit on the heart of what
we’re trying to build here: a self-help society. Each of us has to
decide for himself. As for me, I suppose I think, really, that if the
bastards are going to suck us dry, I’d like to get in a couple of good
left- handers before I turn the other cheek.</p>
<p><strong>salladin</strong>: But who will rent to us!</p>
<p><strong>surya</strong>: I have a property I will rent you for two
hundred rupees a month, and not a rupee less. As for protection… you are
on your own.</p>
<p><strong>montage - int./ext. cowsheds - day</strong>: Two cows are
shooed out of the ramshackle building as Said, with the strength of
three men, holds up a heavy We see that Max and Hasari are thrown
together again The whole group shares a meal, prepared under the
Equipment from the old school/clinic being moved from</p>
<p><strong>upstairs and stairwell</strong>: Hasari and Max move the last
cot upstairs and into place beside a window that will come into play at
the end . Hasari nods to Max, indicating he should look.</p>
<p><strong>their pov</strong>: Everyone gathered as Shanta and Ashish
put a banner above the door: “You are invited to the festival of this
world and your life is blessed.” The assemblage applauds and
embraces.</p>
<p><strong>ext. clinic - night</strong>: Everyone lingers, adults and
children. Max plays his trumpet, accompanying Surya on his zither.
Manooj hovers over Max.</p>
<p><strong>manooj</strong>: Doctor Big Brother, aren’t you going to
smoke your evening cigar?</p>
<p><strong>manooj</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>ram</strong>: It has come to me tonight to write a letter to
my wife.</p>
<p><strong>ram</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: He thrusts the paper at Max. Max takes a
pen from his pocket.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Okay – shott.</p>
<p><strong>ram</strong>: Yes – what is the word – that word – when land
is watered… with canals?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: “Irrigation”?</p>
<p><strong>ram</strong>: Yes, yes, that word, I want that word in the
letter.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>ram</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What would you like to say to your wife?</p>
<p><strong>ram</strong>: I don’t know, Max Daddah. If I knew what to say
to my wife, I’d never have left home.</p>
<p><strong>manooj</strong>: Why do you have to go home, Doctor Babu?</p>
<p><strong>aloka</strong>: Because he doesn’t live here, Manooj. This is
not his home.</p>
<p><strong>above</strong>: A whole row of faces on rooftops enjoying the
cigar. This as we:</p>
<p><strong>ext. green acres - through rickshaw wheels - day</strong>:
THROUGH the WHEELS we see Max come briskly out of the hotel carrying his
doctor’s bag. He’s met by the sight of Hasari between the shafts of his
rickshaw and Anouar and Meeta perched on the seat.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: On no! Lepers! Lepers in my neighborhood!</p>
<p><strong>anouar</strong>: Sshh! Doctor Big Brother, please, we are
pretending not to be lepers.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Oh, oh, I didn’t get the concept – of course,
not lepers. I think you’re going to fool a lot of people. I have only
one question: Why are you here?</p>
<p><strong>anouar</strong>: We’ve come to take you to the dispensary in
grand style on this special day, haven’t we, Hasari?</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Na, I’ll just trot alongside Hasari.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: No, please, get in.</p>
<p><strong>anouar</strong>: Meeta’s very excited by this ride through
Calcutta. You see, she’s never been sightseeing before.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You’re incorrigible, Anouar.</p>
<p><strong>anouar</strong>: Yes, yes, I know, thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>ext. side street - day</strong>: Margareta, Manooj, Shambu,
Shoba, several other kids and, at the end of the line, Poomina, all
carrying water on their heads toward the City of Joy. Suddenly, someone
whispers to Poomina. One of Ashoka’s thugs. She glances after Margareta
and the other kids who are turning a corner and steps into:</p>
<p><strong>alleyway</strong>: Where Ashoka waits.</p>
<p><strong>ashoka</strong>: You taking that to the clinic? You like it
there? And they love your smile, don’t they?</p>
<p><strong>their pov - clinic - from distance</strong>: Two hundred
normal people lined up outside the gaily be- decked dispensary – many
mothers with small children in their arms. Shanta sees Aloka, gestures
to indicate the incredible turn-out. The normals at the end of the line
turn to look at the approaching LEPERS.</p>
<p><strong>leper woman</strong>: It is too beautiful to believe.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: As if indeed she were right, their path
is suddenly cut off by the Goonda and a commando of thugs, armed with
sticks and iron bars, backed up by a group carrying banners with slogans
proclaiming in Hindi, Urdu, English: “We Don’t Want Lepers Here!”
There’s a sudden uneasy silence. Behind the thugs a short distance is
the policeman who harassed Max earlier and another cop. Joan hurries
forward.</p>
<p><strong>goonda</strong>: Good morning, Sister to the poor.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Yes, Mr. Bhose?</p>
<p><strong>goonda</strong>: Those people aren’t coming into this
neighborhood.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: They are going to be treated at the
dispensary. You have no right to stop them.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: Hasari arrives with Max, Anouar, and
Meeta.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Go ahead, Aloka, take them inside.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Take your hands off her, you waster!</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: Max . Max slings the Goonda against
the side of a truck.</p>
<p><strong>goonda</strong>: That was a mistake, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: The mistake’s yours, putz. Get these people
inside.</p>
<p><strong>angle on dispensary</strong>: An EXPLOSION in the doorway,
scattering anyone who remains in the area of the dispensary doorway,
badly wounding Mehboub. More people with sticks. Hasari goes down under
several bodies. Max reaches Aloka, helps her up, sends her toward the
clinic. He tears an attacker off of Hasari and they fight back to back a
moment. A SECOND EXPLOSION near them… and through the smoke Max
sees…</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: Ashoka astride his motorcycle, behind
his dark glasses, with more thugs, these with Molotov cocktails and
pick- axes, ready to raze the clinic and school and the surrounding
neighborhood. Sunil drags Mehboub inside. People chant: “White Monkeys,
go home! White Monkeys, go home! No lepers here! No lepers here!” The
thugs cock their iron bars and bricks and Molotov cocktails. Max picks
up an iron bar of his own and starts for Ashoka. Suddenly, there’s a
DETONATION followed by a BLAST of air so fierce, Max is thrown to the
ground. A bottle of GASOLINE has EXPLODED just behind him. He’s
enveloped in smoke.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Oh, little girl, little girl…</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: We’ll pay! All right then, so by all means,
protect us!</p>
<p><strong>ashoka</strong>: In a world such as ours, everyone needs
protection. For the fee we discussed, from this day forward, I can
assure you nothing like this will happen again.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: A beat… Saladdin is at Joan’s shoulder.
Ashoka points a finger at Hasari.</p>
<p><strong>ashoka</strong>: You. I warned you about the company you
keep.</p>
<p><strong>int. courtyard - day</strong>: People peer in through every
opening. Mehboub’s chest is bandaged. Sunil squeezes through the packed
courtyard and hallway, Ashish carrying a wounded woman behind him.
Hasari steps into a doorway, us WITH him.</p>
<p><strong>int. examining room - max, aloka, poomina</strong>: Max,
blood crusted on her face, sutures Poomina’s awful facial wound as Aloka
prepares a compress.</p>
<p><strong>aloka</strong>: Will she… Her face, will it…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: If she’s very careful and doesn’t do anything
to open the wound, the scarring will be minimal. Do you understand? You
can’t… You have to stay here. You make her stay here.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: I’ll try.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Don’t goddamn try, Joan! Goddamn do it!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I hate this place, I hate this place, I hate
this place.</p>
<p><strong>ext. godfather’s courtyard - hand and pencil - day</strong>:
A hand tap, tap, taps against a ledger.</p>
<p><strong>courtyard</strong>: Ashoka sits behind a little table,
picking absently at his face. The Goonda is slouched near the table,
smoking a cigarette and fiddling with a thin switch. ficult for him to
show Ashoka the respect his inherited The Goonda has a bruise under one
eye from his altercation in the City of Joy yesterday. The air is filled
with the MUFFLED SOUNDS OF the STREET. FROM here, we can see the
evermore enfeebled godfather in his “throne room,” wrapped in a
cashmere, listening to the radio. Ashoka looks up, stares impassively at
someone.</p>
<p><strong>ashoka</strong>: Well. What have you got to say?</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: For the first time, we see who
Ashoka’s speaking to.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: I told them that your father provides us
with a great deal and that –</p>
<p><strong>ashoka</strong>: From this minute, you are off the list! You
will leave your rickshaw here… where it will be reserved for a man who
deserves our trust.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: Please, Babu, this is as if the ground has
opened up. I have to speak to Mr. Ghatak!</p>
<p><strong>ashoka</strong>: My father’s ill! You are speaking to me!</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: I have a family!</p>
<p><strong>ashoka</strong>: The decision is made. I have made it. Now
get out before I have Mr. Bhose break your legs.</p>
<p><strong>ext. godfather’s house - day</strong>: The side gate opens
and Hasari is shoved out. Stumbling, he runs to the fence, peers
through. Two men are pulling his rickshaw into the courtyard. Hasari
watches as a steel shutter is pulled down, cutting his livelihood from
sight.</p>
<p><strong>angle through bar - hasari</strong>: Numb, compromised,
defeated. Perhaps the low point of his life.</p>
<p><strong>int. clinic - joan’s room - “raft of medusa” -
night</strong>: Flickering candlelight illuminates the “Raft of Medusa.”
Max rails at Joan.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I just don’t… I don’t want to… I don’t want to
care! I don’t want to care this much! I just don’t want to be invested
in you people. In people! I became a goddamn doctor because my goddamn
father wanted me to be a goddamn doctor because he was a goddamn doctor!
He was the goddamn king of doctors! It’s too goddamn hard!</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Not everyone’s cut out for this. You did the
best you could. Better than many. It’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I didn’t do the best I could! I did what I
always do! I shot my big mouth off and did a half-assed job. And what I
want to do now is I want to go back to America and make money and live a
life without entanglements and demands and people hanging on me.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: You know, the fact is from the minute we’re
born we’re shipwrecked. Some see that as a lifetime of drowning, of
fear, others only to endure, but to triumph. It’s all in the individual
spirit, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Got it: To run, to spectate, to commit. Running
spectator.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Then, by all means, go home, Max, and go with
my blessing and my eternal friendship.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: They took away my rickshaw.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: So what do you want me to do about it – get it
back for you?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’m sorry. I’m going home. Because this isn’t
my fight. I got one person to look after – me.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: All right, I’m running out, okay? Because I’m a
coward, this is me, this is what I do, I get in over my head, I let
people down, I run.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: But I trusted you.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Well, that was your goddamn mistake!</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: I don’t know how I’m going to pay the rent,
how we’re going to eat.</p>
<p><strong>aloka</strong>: We have what is saved for Amrita’s dowry.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: The children must leave the school; they’ll
have to work. And you will not have anything to do with the clinic or
those people anymore.</p>
<p><strong>ram</strong>: What I earn is yours, too.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: You can’t support all of us. You have a
family in your village, too.</p>
<p><strong>int. ram’s hut</strong>: Alone in his pain, he spots his tea
caddy in which he planted his seeds over a month ago. He bends over to
tenderly touch the growing shoot and water the earth. He looks up and
the three children are staring at him. What will their father do now to
keep them alive?</p>
<p><strong>int. blood dispensary - close on hasari’s arm - day</strong>:
The needle injected, Hasari’s blood flowing into a bottle.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: Hasari seated on the stool, watching
his blood leave his body, his face again broken out in perspiration.</p>
<p><strong>his pov - rafik</strong>: Waiting.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene - hasari</strong>: His face immobile, his
thoughts distant. The Attendant starts to pull the needle out. Hasari
stops his hand.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: Take more.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: Take more.</p>
<p><strong>ext. blood bank - day</strong>: Barely ambulatory, Hasari
starts down the street, but has to stop, lean against a wall. Through
his woozy haze, he thinks he sees an apparition.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: There, in the entrance to a building,
is Gangooly. Seeing a potential victim, he swoops in.</p>
<p><strong>gangooly</strong>: Not well, brother?</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: Still stealing from refugees?</p>
<p><strong>gangooly</strong>: Well, yes, I remember you, of course –
hello! I am delighted to see you – yes. And tell me immediately, please
– your little family, your beautiful children, everyone eats, yes. Come,
have a cup of tea or a little something stronger, we must celebrate.</p>
<p><strong>gangooly</strong>: Ah, well, you’re angry at me, yes, I
wondered if that was still on your mind – I am full of regret about
that, yes, even a little tormented. What can I say? I have the spirit of
an eagle trapped in the body of a crow.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: I’m touched.</p>
<p><strong>gangooly</strong>: My friend, I am lame and I am poor. Does
that mean that I shouldn’t survive? Huh? When a man is struggling in a
rough sea, he clutches onto what he can or he drowns. You don’t look so
well.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: I lost my rickshaw.</p>
<p><strong>gangooly</strong>: Ach! I have an offer. No, listen! Shiva be
my witness, you must at least think about this. Please, I can help… Or
my name is not Mr. Gangooly.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: Which, fortunately, it is.</p>
<p><strong>ext. street - moving shot - day</strong>: Gangooly guiding
Hasari onward.</p>
<p><strong>gangooly</strong>: Remove the children from the school – no,
why? When you, the father, can make a small sacrifice. Nature has
foreseen your plight. For she has given you two eyes, yes, and two
kidneys. But. To live, you have need of one only. I have a friend who
sold his kidney – this one – and now – believe me, this is the truth –
he lives in a brick home… which he owns.</p>
<p><strong>door - day</strong>: A forbidding face appears at the grill,
stares out.</p>
<p><strong>int. skeleton warehouse - day</strong>: Hasari and Gangooly
enter. A repulsive smell almost makes Hasari gag. Gangooly takes
Hasari’s arm and steers him through the gloom. Hasari discovers the
origin of the smell. A line of skeletons arranged along the walls.
Tables stacked with bones: skulls, spines, rib cages, hands and feet.
Each skeleton sports a label with a price in U.S. dollars. Crouched
among the bones and packing crates are men work- ing. Some smoke, some
have masks over their faces. They scrape and clean and decorticate. They
skillfully assemble their grisly creations, emotionless but like
artists.</p>
<p><strong>pov - manager’s office - day</strong>: THROUGH a dusty,
glass, interior window, we see, almost in mime, the manager examining
Hasari.</p>
<p><strong>int. manager’s office</strong>: With a smile, the manager
produces some papers. Hasari shakes his head, starts for the door.
Gangooly stops him.</p>
<p><strong>gangooly</strong>: Of course, take some time, think about it.
People all over the world, anxiously waiting, willing to pay. 15,000
rupees for a kidney. 25,000 for an eye.</p>
<p><strong>int./ext. taxi - road to airport - day</strong>: Heat haze on
the road. As we FOCUS, we FIND Max, Joan, Aloka, also with their
thoughts. Joan gazes out the window of the taxi. Max looks at the back
of Joan’s head a moment, then looks at Aloka, who sits between them. She
deflects his eyes forward.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Hasari has forbid her to have anything more to
do with us. He’d be very angry if he knew she was seeing you off.</p>
<p><strong>int. airport - departure area - wide shot - day</strong>:
First we see joyous people greeting arriving passengers; parents greet a
young man returning from college abroad. The way clears and we CLOSE IN
ON Max, Joan, and Aloka, a tiny island in this sea of people at the
moment of their parting. Max empties all the money out of his
pockets.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: This is for Poomina. When I get home…</p>
<p><strong>aloka</strong>: You did good things. Thank you for coming to
our country.</p>
<p><strong>int. cafeteria - aloka and joan - day</strong>: Sparsely
populated. They sit in isolation at a table over a cup of tea.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: It’s not like he’s royalty or anything, so I’m
not persuaded we have to wait for the plane to actually take off.</p>
<p><strong>aloka</strong>: No. We should go.</p>
<p><strong>angle on door</strong>: Max. Standing inside the departure
doorway.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What were those three choices again?</p>
<p><strong>ext. compound - day</strong>: Hasari returns. Goes into Ram’s
hut.</p>
<p><strong>int. ram’s hut - day</strong>: He finds his family… and Max.
The two men stare at each other.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I need Aloka at the clinic. All right, they,
the patients, need her. She’s a good nurse. Come on, man, this is
between you and me. Why take the kids out of school, why punish your
wife?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I have a little money, I can get it from the
States…</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: It’s not a question of money. We’ll survive
on our own.</p>
<p><strong>aloka</strong>: Maybe he’s right. The clinic is for everyone
and if I am needed –</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: No! I’m your husband and you’ll do as I say!
Unless, of course, you’ve become an American wife and then you’ll do as
you please!</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: Stay away from them. They are not part of
us. They will only be good to you as long as you please them.</p>
<p><strong>ext. leper colony - day</strong>: The small colony alive; a
line of patients outside a door.</p>
<p><strong>int. room - day</strong>: Max unwraps a bandage from a
leper’s partial limb. Looks around for Aloka. She’s not there. Said is
acting as his nurse. Points at his instruments.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Hand me the scissors, please.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Scissors, scissors.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Not that end – No, that’s fine, thanks, I’ve
got it.</p>
<p><strong>ext. leper colony - day</strong>: Max comes out with his last
patient. Anouar waits.</p>
<p><strong>anouar</strong>: Max Daddah, you are finished? Follow me.</p>
<p><strong>int. tannery - day</strong>: Max follows Anouar past bubbling
cauldrons and heaps of animal skins. The place stinks fiercely. Anouar
and Max exit into…</p>
<p><strong>a small yard</strong>: Two young men … and something covered
with a tarp.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You didn’t steal this.</p>
<p><strong>ramatullah</strong>: The police, Sahib, they stole it. We
stole it from them.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The pullers whip the tarp off. A
battered rickshaw, the springs poking out of the seat, the broken wheels
lying in the body, the finish scarred and gouged, one shaft broken.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>ext. square - day</strong>: Max comes into the square. Aloka
and Selima are pre- paring meals. Manooj, Shambu, and three other boys
playing. Ram is trying to jolly Hasari, who’s deep in his own reverie.
Max stands in front of Hasari.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’d like to show you something. Just take a
minute.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Go ahead. Go on.</p>
<p><strong>ext. courtyard and storage shed - clinic</strong>: The sound
of a PADLOCK being UNLOCKED. DARK SCREEN. Light flashes. Max and Hasari
appear in the doorway. Surprised by the light, a few rats scurry off.
Some- where a dog BARKS. Slated, shafted light. He indicates a
corner.</p>
<p><strong>the rickshaw</strong>: Piled up in its ruin.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’m good with my hands. You’re good with yours.
What do you say?</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: If I were to go on the street with this
machine, I would end up in a gutter with my throat cut.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Well, it’s yours if you want it. You know the
license, the cops, all that can be fixed. You’ll own this – it’ll have
nothing to do with the Godfather.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: Doctor Daddah, I’m just a small man. Don’t
try to tempt me again with big thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You didn’t want me to quit. Well, I came
back.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: But can you be trusted?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I hope so.</p>
<p><strong>ext. latrines - fountain - aloka - day</strong>: She takes
her morning absolutions, bathing in the foun- tain. The process is
extremely sensual, though there is not even a glimpse of her nakedness
as she moves her clothing around, cleansing this area, then that. She
glances up to see…</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: Max, in an Indian shirt, heading for
the square; rather naturally, he brings his hands together in the Indian
salutation. He carries several bottles of distilled water, a large value
pack of bar soap, and a carton of medical supplies. As he passes, his
eyes hook on Aloka’s. He lifts a hand in greeting. After a moment, she
ducks her head. He turns and continues on coming face to face with Ram,
an enormous smile on his face. With him, Hasari. He glances at his wife
in the water.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Going to look for work?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: When Hasari doesn’t answer…</p>
<p><strong>ram</strong>: Yes, he is.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Are you taking your medicine?</p>
<p><strong>ram</strong>: Yes, yes, but look at this.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: …he finds himself face to face with
Aloka. Without a word, they start walking side by side toward the
square. It’s several seconds before she says…</p>
<p><strong>aloka</strong>: He’s very proud.</p>
<p><strong>ext. docks - from the gate - day</strong>: Men moving like
ants into the bow of the ship. Hasari is locked out, turned away without
work.</p>
<p><strong>ext. metro construction site - day</strong>: A huge gouge in
the black mud, sunlight streaming through steel girders across it.
Hasari emerges from the ground, looking for someone. Stops him. The
foreman shakes his head, no, before Hasari even has the chance to ask
for work.</p>
<p><strong>face - day</strong>: Then we see he’s standing outside Mitra
&amp; Co., staring at it, wondering if it’s time to sell part of
himself. No! We see on his face a look that tells us he will not be
beaten.</p>
<p><strong>ext. clinic - courtyard - day</strong>: The street children’s
school now takes up two rooms. Children peer out of one room now as, to
the accompani- ment of Surya’s zither, twenty or so girls are doing some
Indian classical dancing, under the eye of a young Indian teacher.
Across the way, in the other room, some children are translating Bengali
words into English. A boy is writing on the board. It’s Manooj. We see
that Shambu is in the same class.</p>
<p><strong>int. examining room</strong>: FROM BEHIND, we watch Max take
a wrapping off of Poomina’s wound, Joan assisting him. Indeed, Ashoka
extended Poomina’s smile on either side of her mouth. The scars are
healing as nicely as could be expected. Max did a fine job.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You must have had a good doctor. Still no
running, jumping, picking up anything heavy. And you stay here. You’re
going to help Sister Joan and you’re going to school. Do you
understand?</p>
<p><strong>the goonda</strong>: Time to collect the rent, Sister.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Of course. Come with me, please.</p>
<p><strong>across the courtyard</strong>: Manooj, with a small tin of
food, looks this way and that… and then sneaks into the shed.</p>
<p><strong>ext. shed - day</strong>: We hear a, TAP, TAP, TAP. The door
is half open. The padlock is hanging on its chain. Max opens the
door.</p>
<p><strong>int. storage room</strong>: Startled, frightened, Hasari
presses himself against the wall, as does Manooj. Hasari is wearing a
wet dhoti, caught in the middle of straightening the wheel rim of the
old rickshaw.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: Close the door!</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: Close the door. The Godfather has more eyes
than a pineapple.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: I was saying to Manooj that if a man bows
down too many times, there will come a day when he will no longer be
able to stand upright.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I promised Manooj and Shambu I’d take them to
the movies. Is it all right?</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: If a man makes a promise…</p>
<p><strong>int. movie theater - night</strong>: We’re TRACKING WITH a
moving bag of peanuts behind a row of boy’s heads. On the screen in
front of them, a “medi- eval era” sword battle between the great Kumar
Kapur and a legion of bad guys.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: We hear the sound of CRACKING NUTS as we
MOVE FROM Manooj to three kids we’ve seen in the neighborhood and then
to Shambu, each kid dipping into the bag in his turn. Finally: Max’s The
bag arrives… empty.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Thanks, guys. Who wants to go for more
peanuts?</p>
<p><strong>ext. street - near city of joy - night</strong>: Max and the
boys walking home after the movie, the boys dancing around each other,
acting out the fight sequences, all of the sword-fighting against Max,
who battles them all over the street, in and around cars, Poomina and
Amrita looking on shyly, as El Max fights to save their honor.</p>
<p><strong>manooj</strong>: I can’t decide if I want to be Kumar Kapur
or a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Ha ha! You can be both! Manooj Pal,
swashbuckling physician!</p>
<p><strong>manooj</strong>: You’re so much fun, El Max. I wish my daddy
were as much fun as you.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I wish my father loved me like your father
loves you. Your dad’s a very special man. And now, en garde!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Time out, men. Off the street till this truck
passes.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The kids move toward the wall of the
building they’re passing, but the truck seems to turn toward them, seem-
ing not to intend to pass, but to hit them. The look on Max’s face lets
us know he senses something terrible is in the offing here. He shouts
for the kids to get out of the way, shoving the kids closest to him into
a doorway. He turns to Shambu, who’s behind him, calls to him. But in a
panic, Shambu doesn’t move into the shelter of the building on his
right… but tries to run across the street. Max leaps for the little boy
too late… as the truck just misses Max and clips Shambu hard, sending
the little boy flying.</p>
<p><strong>ext. square - night</strong>: Manooj runs ahead of everyone
as he charges into Ram’s hut, crying for his father. Behind Manooj come
the others, Max carrying Shambu in his arms. Hasari and Aloka, Ram,
Joan, others in the square hurtle out of their huts.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I can’t do anything here. He’s got a compound
fracture, he hemorrhaging. We’ve got to get to a hospital – now!</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: You’ll never get a taxi at this hour.</p>
<p><strong>ext street - hasari’s feet - day</strong>: He pounds along,
the wheels wobbling and squeaking, urging people out of his way. Max
runs alongside Hasari. Aloka sits on the seat with Shambu, whose quiet
moaning fills her ears. Blood drips down the rickshaw.</p>
<p><strong>ext. park street - from the rickshaw - day</strong>: Several
taxis waiting for clients outside a row of restaurants. Hasari and Aloka
watch as Max argues with the drivers. They won’t take a bleeding
passenger.</p>
<p><strong>same street - moments later</strong>: The race to the
hospital continues.</p>
<p><strong>ext. medwar pine memorial hospital - night</strong>: The
arrive at the gates of the huge, Victorian hospital. People sleep
outside the gates.</p>
<p><strong>int. hospital - corridor - side room - day</strong>: The
wards are full, as are the corridors. Patients on beds and stretchers
everywhere. Most have at least one member of their family to look over
them. In a side room, Max is arguing with a porter who tells him he
can’t help him. Max slaps some rupees into the porter’s hand, tells him
to take him to the person in charge. Shambu is fading. Aloka smooths the
sweat from his brow, trying to keep Shambu alive by force of will and
love. Then Max is back, standing over her with another man. It may take
a moment before we recognize the ATTENDANT from the Blood Bank.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: They’ll admit him, but we have to pay for the
blood. I gave him all I had. He wants more. Do you have anything?</p>
<p><strong>aloka</strong>: Sister Joan gave me this.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: We haven’t got any more!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: If this child dies while you stand here, I’ll
kill you.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Now, I need an X-ray room and I need an O.R.
nurse.</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: Not possible. You can’t give care, you’re
an American. You must be an Indian doctor.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Then take me to one!</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: Max hurtles down the corridor with a
young INTERN in tow. Almost a kid, he’s been up for days. But he’s going
to help.</p>
<p><strong>intern</strong>: This way, please.</p>
<p><strong>ext. hosptial - day</strong>: Hasari and Aloka wait. People
are starting to move about.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: You’re my wife, Aloka, you and my children
are all my wealth. But if Max Daddah and Big Sister Joan have need of
you, you may go to them.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: We pinned his leg. Couple of months, he’ll be
better than ever. They want to keep him today. We’re a good team. Gimme
five.</p>
<p><strong>ext. clinic - courtyard - day</strong>: The whole community
is here, around the tree.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: I don’t think it was an accident. I think they
were aiming for Max. So, what we have to ask ourselves is whether his
presence is endangering all of us.</p>
<p><strong>anouar</strong>: Even from my low vantage point, I know this:
It’s the son. He’s mad.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: Max Daddah is our friend. If they’re trying
to harm him, then they’re trying to harm all of us. We must stand by him
as one.</p>
<p><strong>int. shed - close on two paintbrushes - night</strong>: dip
into a little box of paints. The boys look on as the two men paint an
intricate design on the shafts. Shambu sits in the rickshaw seat. He
wears an ankle to hip cast. Manooj is spelling words and urging Shambu
to follow suit. Aloka is putting out a tray of food. Ram, Ramatullah,
and Chomotkar slip in, quickly close the door. The two pullers focus on
the rickshaw, Ram on Max.</p>
<p><strong>ram</strong>: Doctor Daddah, please, very important, only one
moment.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: This is going to cost me every rupee I didn’t
make today.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: A letter from your wife.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: This is postmarked six weeks ago.</p>
<p><strong>ram</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: So, what have you been doing – incubating
it?</p>
<p><strong>ram</strong>: I was afraid.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: ‘My dear husband…’</p>
<p><strong>ram</strong>: Oh that’s very hopeful so far!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: ‘Your words brought tears of joy to my arid
eyes.’</p>
<p><strong>ram</strong>: Oh, I’m in love! My words brought tears to her
arid eyes! What does that mean – arid?</p>
<p><strong>manooj</strong>: I know! Dry.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Correct. Her eyes were dry, your letter
irrigated them.</p>
<p><strong>ram</strong>: Aaah!</p>
<p><strong>chomotkar</strong>: This is a puka nasgar. What a curse that
you can’t use it.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: I’m going on the streets tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Listen. I don’t want you to think I’m crazy,
but I don’t think that truck was an accident.</p>
<p>****: I think Ashoka was after me. You can bet he’ll be after you
too.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: I’m going to speak to his father.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Can I go with you? I’ll go with you. Can I go
with you if I shut up?</p>
<p><strong>ext. godfather’s house - day</strong>: Ghatak is literally
carried out of the house by an orderly and placed into his car. There’s
a driver and there is the Goonda. They start down the street. We’re WITH
the car. Suddenly, the driver slams on the brakes and from:</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: We see Hasari and Max blocking the
street with the new rickshaw. The Goonda jumps out of the car, comes
threateningly at Hasari.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: Babu, please, I beg you, hear my words!</p>
<p><strong>ghatak</strong>: Wait.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: May I say first, Babu, I wish you long life
and good health.</p>
<p><strong>ghatak</strong>: Acha! They take me now to the scientists.
They stick needles in me, take pictures of my insides, study them, and
then tell me what I know.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The Godfather stares at Hasari, flicks
his eyes at Max. Waits.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: When you gave me work, I swore I would be as
your youngest brother. Your son thinks I have been disloyal. He took my
rickshaw. With my friend, I have remade this one. I beg you to let me go
again onto the streets. I have my family.</p>
<p><strong>ghatak</strong>: It is very beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: Thank you, Babu.</p>
<p><strong>ghatak</strong>: If I may say, it has an allure.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: An allure, Babu – thank you.</p>
<p><strong>ghatak</strong>: The world is chaos. We struggle to build
something permanent, then our bodies betray us, our sons betray us. Yes,
you may take your rickshaw out. If you can face up to my son.</p>
<p><strong>ext. skeleton warehouse - day</strong>: Hasari enters.</p>
<p><strong>int. manager’s office - day</strong>: The manager stares at
Hasari, as he consumes a pot of rice and vegetable curry. Gangooly
hovers like a crow. Hasari stares at the contract before him.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: If a man dies and he’s not burned, what do
you think becomes of his soul?</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: I must provide for my family.</p>
<p><strong>gangooly</strong>: Oh, it’s a noble fate. If indeed your
wheel ceases to turn, you will help educate somewhere in this great
world a fine doctor.</p>
<p><strong>ext. godfather’s house - day</strong>: Hasari arrives to an
outcry of anger. There are several dozen rickshaws. Among the passersby,
we see umbrellas, as the people on the street try to combat the
incredible heat.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>chomotkar</strong>: The Godfather ill! The son is raising the
rent!</p>
<p><strong>ashoka</strong>: Do you know how much it costs to change the
spoke in a wheel? Or how much baksheesh I have to pay the police?</p>
<p><strong>ramatullah</strong>: We haven’t been breaking our backs
between the shafts of our rickshaws in order to weep for you!</p>
<p><strong>chomotkar</strong>: The only thing that matters is the bundle
of rupees we take to the munshi each month to feed and to answer the
daily needs of our children!</p>
<p><strong>rassoul</strong>: Listn to me! Listen now! Listen to me!
Friends! I ask you to vote for an unlimited strike. Inkalabad zindabad!
Long live the revolution! Rickshaw Workers Union zindabad!</p>
<p><strong>ashoka</strong>: That’s what I thought. All right, get to
work! Customers are waiting!</p>
<p><strong>on hasari</strong>: Something detonates in him and he jumps
onto the tela- garhi and grabs the microphone from Ashoka. Police arrive
in vans.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: Friends! The Godfather at least is a caring
man! This one, though, the son –</p>
<p><strong>ashoka</strong>: We helped this man! We gave him a job, a
place to live! This is how he shows his gratitude. Get on the streets
now! Or turn in your machines!</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: Friends – don’t! If we stand –</p>
<p><strong>int. bonsal court - day</strong>: Birds flying below ceiling.
The room has a barred cage running all around its edge; the cage is
filled to near overflowing. Hasari stands before the JUDGE, his face
covered with blood, his body a mass of aches and welts. At the back of
the room, Max and Aloka; elsewhere, Ashoka, the Goonda, and several of
his thugs.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: The life of a rickshaw puller is not one a
man would choose if he had a choice. Our feet blister and burn up from
the boiling asphalt, our noses burn from the fumes of countless motor
cars and buses, our backs curve permanently from the loads we carry hour
after hour, day after day. But I am proud to be one of the human horses
who carry my countryman from place to place and I am thankful for the
opportunity to make a living. But I will not keep silent anymore and I
will not be cheated and threatened anymore. Life is hard enough. No
more.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Silence! This man will be permitted to use
his rickshaw without let or hindrance. And I will make a restraining
order against Mr. Ghatak.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: I haven’t finished these proceedings. For his
part in this disturbance, I fine the defendant 50 rupees.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: Fifty rupees, Your Honor? That’s –</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Pay at this time or spend seven days in
jail!</p>
<p><strong>ramatullah</strong>: Hasari!</p>
<p><strong>rassoul</strong>: Hasari!</p>
<p><strong>close on ashoka</strong>: ON his face, we see pure hatred for
these two men.</p>
<p><strong>ext. city of joy - day</strong>: Amrita, Manooj, and Shambu.
With them, Subash flirting with Amrita, incurring the wrath and
admiration of her brothers, causing her to flush. THUNDER sounds. They
all look up. Rain starts to fall. People run outside of workshops and
huts, crying, “The rains, the rains.” Suddenly, a THUNDERCLAP shakes the
earth and rain begins to bombard them. The rain falls, the WIND HOWLS,
and people in the lane are dancing, praising the beginning of the
monsoon season. Men tear off their shirts, women rush out fully clothed,
singing. Swarms of naked children run about. The kids run toward the
clinic/school.</p>
<p><strong>ext. clinic courtyard - day</strong>: Hasari is locking his
rickshaw into the shed. Staff and several patients come out of the
examining rooms – Joan, Aloka, Sunil, Anouar, Poomina. Margareta and her
students, a new teacher, Bandona, her students come out of the
classrooms… They’re all swept up in dancing, Joan’s metal cross jumping
about as if it were beating out time. From his balcony, Max emerges with
his trumpet and plays the first bars of “Singin’ In the Rain.” Everyone
looks his way; he begins to hum and sing as he jumps over the balcony to
the ground and takes off in a wild, impro- vished, but damn good version
of Gene Kelly’s dance in the rain, bringing Anouar on his cart in as his
dancing partner. Everyone in the courtyard crowds around them, laughing
and encouraging the dancer/singers on. The number builds to an
extraordinary climax with Max sliding through mud to an exquisite finish
at Joan’s feet. There’s thunderous applause.</p>
<p><strong>int. clinic - night</strong>: Rain. Max, The Pals, Ram, Joan,
Anouar, Meeta and the Baby, Poomina, Saladdin, Mehboub, Ashish, Shanta,
Margareta, Bandona, and the other members of the commit- tee sharing a
meal.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: Really – a boyfriend, Amrita?</p>
<p><strong>amrita</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>manooj</strong>: Yes, she does. His name is Subash Ghosh. His
father owns the workshop.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: Is there someone you care about?</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: Then I must speak to his father and I must
complete your dowry.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: You will make people sigh at how beautiful
you are. And I shall drop tears of joy.</p>
<p><strong>ram</strong>: At my wedding I became so frightened, my father
gave me things to drink to calm me down. I went out to piss and fell
asleep under the village tree. When I woke I thought it was the tree I’d
married. I still love that tree.</p>
<p><strong>on max</strong>: He sleeps. Suddenly he’s grabbed, his eyes
spring open in fear. Hands yanks him out of bed, slam him up against the
wall, then hurtle him across the room and into:</p>
<p><strong>bathroom</strong>: Where the tub has been filled. His head is
slammed down underwater and he’s held there struggling.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: His head is yanked up and through bleary
eyes he sees a knife at his throat and the Hewbrew letter chai dangling
from the knife - wielder’s neck, illuminated by a flashlight.</p>
<p><strong>ashoka</strong>: Go home, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>clinic</strong>: He pounds through the puddles, past a sleepy
old watchman, and through the gate.</p>
<p><strong>int. courtyard - night</strong>: He bangs on Joan’s door. She
opens the door in her Indian pajamas. One look at him…</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: What’s happened?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Ashoka ordered me to go home. Well, I’ve come
home.</p>
<p><strong>ext. park circus - day</strong>: The rickshaw station. The
rain pours down. People clambor for rickshaws. The line moves forward as
fast as the pullers can take on passengers. Hasari, Ram, Ramatullah,
Chomotkar look at the stalled buses, the streetcars, the taxis, the
private cars.</p>
<p><strong>chomotkar</strong>: What a joy it is to survey this disaster!
We will all make a fortune!</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: The monsoon is the great Durga’s gift to the
human horse!</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>ram</strong>: I’m wet and I’m cold. Your daughter is getting
married. Time is passing. I want to go home to my wife.</p>
<p><strong>ramatullah</strong>: Hasari!</p>
<p><strong>marwari #4</strong>: How much to the market?</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: Eight rupees.</p>
<p><strong>marwari #4</strong>: What! I won’t pay it!</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: Who else needs a ride? I am available at a
price!</p>
<p><strong>marwari #4</strong>: No! Take me – I’ll pay, let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: The price just went up! Ten rupees! In
advance.</p>
<p><strong>ext. wedding shop - day</strong>: Water pours down. FROM HERE
we see Hasari inside, putting money down in front of the shop owner and
then hustling back into the rain and taking up his shafts. We WATCH the
owner look after him with a touch of disdain as he comes into the window
and takes down the beautiful green and gold sari.</p>
<p><strong>ext. clinic - gutters - night</strong>: Water pouring from
above; the gutters overflow with refuse. We PAN UP to the clinic.</p>
<p><strong>int. clinic room</strong>: Hasari enters. Max looks at him,
doesn’t like the look of the obviously exhausted man.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: How can I help?</p>
<p><strong>- day</strong>: An Anglo couple jockeying for preference.
Hasari selects them from a crowd. This is the beginning of RUNNING</p>
<p><strong>montage.</strong>: He runs AT us from different directions
with riders He drags up with an entire, well-to-do family of six, He
stumbles to a stop outside the emergency entrance</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: An upper-crust Brahmin dressed in crisp
white, an Four uniformed school children huddled, laughing</p>
<p><strong>int. leper colony - meeta’s room - day</strong>: The rain
continues, as does the work in the clinic. Max is working on Anouar,
Aloka assisting. Meeta and the baby in the b.g.</p>
<p><strong>anouar</strong>: I think Aloka would have a gentler touch
than you, Max Daddah. Maybe she should perform this surgery on her
own.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Last time you told me you were more than two
women could manage.</p>
<p><strong>anouar</strong>: Yes, but given a choice between one and
none, I will accept the one.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Okay, you ought to be good for another few
days. Send in the next patient.</p>
<p><strong>low angle</strong>: The first impulse of each is to touch the
other’s head. But almost simultaneously, their hands freeze short of
touching. Several months ago, Max might have tried to kiss her; now,
though, there is friendship and affection. FROM here, we see a pair of
bare feet. We COME WITH Max and Aloka UP.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: Shoba, a deeply concerned look on his
face. Slowly his hands come forward, holding his parrot, with a broken
wing. He puts the parrot on the examining table.</p>
<p><strong>int. post office - day</strong>: Hasari seals a letter and a
money order into an envelope, seals, and puts it into the slot. He is
clearly exhausted. Outside he can see two Sikh merchants at his
rickshaw, looking around in the rain for him. He hurries toward the
door.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: Here! I’m here!</p>
<p><strong>int. subash’s house - night</strong>: Aloka and three women
huddled beside a window, Amrita half hidden behind them. We PAN ACROSS a
staircase TO another window, THROUGH which we see a doorway. In the
doorway, Subash turns to smile a shy smile at Amrita; he shrugs. PAST
him now, we see Hasari facing SUBASH’S FATHER and three UNCLES, surly
men with hair matted with mustard oil. The Ghoshes are all seated on low
chairs and stools. Hasari is standing.</p>
<p><strong>int. room - night</strong>: Mr. Ghosh and the Uncles stare at
Hasari, who stands politely and hopefully before them.</p>
<p><strong>mr. ghosh</strong>: You’re a rickshaw puller, am I
correct?</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: Yes, that’s correct.</p>
<p><strong>mr. ghosh</strong>: And I a partner in the workshop where
your daughter is employed. Were you aware of that?</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: Yes, yes, I was, my daughter told me, thank
you.</p>
<p><strong>mr. ghosh</strong>: Yes, well then, perhaps you can tell me
why I would permit my son to marry your daughter.</p>
<p><strong>uncle #1</strong>: Just a moment, please.</p>
<p><strong>uncle #1</strong>: Are you saying there’s no way you’d
consider this match?</p>
<p><strong>uncle #1</strong>: Perhaps some inducement? Would that be of
any help?</p>
<p><strong>mr. ghosh</strong>: What could he possibly offer?</p>
<p><strong>uncle #1</strong>: Probably nothing. But perhaps, in
fairness, we should find out.</p>
<p><strong>ext. streets - day</strong>: Hasari, mouth half open, flecked
with spume, pulls a huge Marwari. He’s pouring sweat, his eyes are
blood- shot. He has never looked more like a horse. They arrive at a
cross street. The Marwari gets down and pays Hasari. Hasari slumps
against the rickshaw and, while he awaits his next rider, counts his
crum- pled pile of notes and coins.</p>
<p><strong>ext. clinic - day</strong>: Max, Joan, Aristotle John,
Margareta, Mehboub, perhaps a dozen others trying to raise the level of
the low wall at the entrance with bricks. The wall caves in. Other
people in the neighborhood rush to rebuild it.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: My dear friends, it’s just occurred to me what
inspired me to stay here.</p>
<p><strong>margareta</strong>: What’s that, Doctor Big Brother?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: The opportunity to acquire waterfront property
at a reasonable price.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: I hate to admit it, junior, but that was
actually quite witty.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Ut-nobody laugh; it’s a natural disaster – we
have guests.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’d throw my cape down, but I’m all out of dry
capes.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: It’s very nice to see you. Both of you.</p>
<p><strong>ravi</strong>: We heard you were still here. Vijay wanted to
send some things.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: She indicates the car, which is packed
with dry food and such.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Shall we unload the car?</p>
<p><strong>ravi</strong>: Yes, yes, by all means.</p>
<p><strong>manubai</strong>: I’m surprised. I really didn’t think you’d
stick it out.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: People grow older; sometimes they even grow
up.</p>
<p><strong>ext. mud bank - wide shot - day</strong>: Anouar on Said’s
shoulders. The big mute runs, followed by Hasari and a phalanx of
rickshaw pullers: Chomotkar, Rassoul, Ramatullah-Joan, Aloka, Manooj,
several others in the rickshaws, Max and Sunil, each with his doctor bag
– all of them running in silhouette along the embankment in the
rain.</p>
<p><strong>aristotle john</strong>: Where can we take them? We can’t
take them back to the clinic. No one will put up with it.</p>
<p><strong>saladdin</strong>: We can’t let them drown, can we? Eh, Max
Daddah?</p>
<p><strong>ext. leper colony - day</strong>: The leper colony is
submerged. The parents have put their children on the roofs and the
relatively able- bodied lepers are piling charpoys one on top of another
to protect the sick and the infirm. Meeta and her baby are on a roof.
The mud bank is too slippery to get the rickshaws down and back up.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: It’s too deep!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: A beat.</p>
<p><strong>day - some minutes later</strong>: A leper clings to a rope
as several of the human horses pull him and others up the mud bank.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: Max, Hasari, Rassoul, and Chomotkar
up to their necks in water; Hasari and Rassoul have a door on their
shoulders; on top of the door, a sick leper woman. Max is lifting one
child, then another onto the door. The two pullers make their way slowly
toward the mud bank.</p>
<p><strong>on mud bank</strong>: Aloka, Joan, helping lepers into
rickshaw.</p>
<p><strong>meeta</strong>: Anouar!</p>
<p><strong>anouar</strong>: Max Daddah!</p>
<p><strong>on meeta and baby</strong>: The hut starts to come apart
under them. Max and Chomotkar quickly move to the house with another
door.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: We’re here! We’re here!</p>
<p><strong>ext. mud bank - day</strong>: Hasari pulling the lead
rickshaw. Anouar on Max’s shoulders, the two of them leading a terrible
ensemble version of “Hound Dog.” An air of festivity among lepers and
rescuers. They come to a bridge made of two planks over rushing
water.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Several rickshaws go across but as Max
and Anouar start over, suddenly the ground gives way beneath Max’s feet.
Anouar falls free; someone grabs him; but a blackish stream rushes into
Max’s mouth and in an instant he’s swept beneath the gurgling filth. The
density of the filth makes his effort to surface ineffective. It looks
for all the world like he’s going to drown.</p>
<p><strong>on others</strong>: Max has disappeared. Instinctively,
Hasari dives into the maelstrom. He, too, disappears. After some
moments, Hasari surfaces, spitting the filth out of his mouth. He dives
again, comes up somewhere else. Dives a third time. Is down. Is down. Is
down. Then suddenly bursts out of the filth, dragging the unconscious
form of Max Loeb into the air. More people have gathered. Cries of:</p>
<p><strong>others</strong>: It’s the doctor. Save Doctor Big
Brother!</p>
<p><strong>close on aloka and max</strong>: And now Max gags, his body
erupts in spasm, and he explodes a stream of black liquid out of his
lungs. Aloka supports his forehead as Max retches again and then comes
still. A beat.</p>
<p><strong>int. classroom - night</strong>: We PAN ACROSS members of our
group – lepers and normals – passing bowls of rice in a simple communal
meal, Singing a religious song quietly. On the floor in the b.g., Anouar
is writing something on a slightly damp stretch of cloth with a child’s
crayon. Said takes the cloth and tacks it to the wall. What Anouar has
written is this, “All that is not given is lost.” Everyone in the room
stares at the words.</p>
<p><strong>int. clinic - max’s room - night</strong>: Max opens his eyes
to find Joan, Hasari, Aloka, and the children keeping a vigil.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Oh, Jesus, the guy went to sleep when he was
supposed to be working? I gotta get up –</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Sshh, sshh, sshh! No heroics, junior. Lay
back. You’re all right.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: All right. Yeah, I am, I’m all right.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Want you guys to know something. About me.
Wanted to be the world’s greatest heart surgeon, just one better than my
dad. Just one. First time I’m the lead surgeon on a case, the main guy,
I choke. Froze. The chief made me step aside. My teacher. Had to take
over for me. Went into radiology. Photography. Had to have somethin’
easy. No pressure. Wasn’t too nuts about myself. Quit.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You people… You… I love you guys.</p>
<p><strong>ext. ram’s hut - two months later - day</strong>: A group
gathered on a dry, sunny afternoon, peering into the hut. We FOCUS on
the growing flower in the tea caddy in the window and then go THROUGH
the window into:</p>
<p><strong>int. pals’ room - day</strong>: Hasari, Max , the local Hara
Giri, Mr. Ghosh and the four Ghosh uncles crammed into the tiny room.
Members of our group jam the doorway, spectating. The air is close.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: I can offer no more than I’ve offered! No
more! All right, I’ll add two dhotis, two vests, and a punjabi. But
that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>mr. ghosh</strong>: That’s all? Did he say that’s all?</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: My daughter’s qualities will make up for
what is lacking.</p>
<p><strong>subash’s father</strong>: Well, it won’t do! I am firm in
requiring for my exceptional son the bicycle, 1000 repees… and one ounce
of gold.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: That’s robbery! The child of a rajah might
be worth that, and I’m not even sure of that! Impossible!</p>
<p><strong>int. st. pius school - headmistresses’ office - day</strong>:
Sister Cecilia, in full habit, looks over a sheaf of test scores. Then
she peers up at…</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: Manooj, seated between Hasari and
Max.</p>
<p><strong>sister cecilia</strong>: Well, indeed I think Sister Joan is
right – we’ve got a prospect here. We’ll start you off with a few
classes; if that works out, we’ll make a proper student of you.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Hasari can’t believe his ears. Manooj
sits frozen. Max grins.</p>
<p><strong>ext. narrow lane - near city of joy - day</strong>: Amrita,
Subash, and Shambu heading home from the work- shop. Shambu’s cast is
gone. Subash flirts with Amrita. They see Hasari, Max, and Manooj coming
toward them. Manooj runs to them, shouting that he’s going to the
school; Amrita, Subash, Shambu congratulate him…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Hey, come on, don’t do this.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Well, what’s the problem here?</p>
<p><strong>ashoka</strong>: You’ve become very brave of late, haven’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Don’t do this.</p>
<p><strong>ashoka</strong>: Oh, I do what I please. You see, my father’s
dead, I’m in charge now. So you will get off my streets, you will leave
my country, and that clinic and school will close.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>ashoka</strong>: My father was weak. He let you and your
European friend give these little people ideas. It’s over.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You can’t do this!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: Get back! Stay back!</p>
<p><strong>ashoka</strong>: No, no, come forward. Come.</p>
<p><strong>ashoka</strong>: What a little woman already, hey?</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: Please, don’t touch her, Babu.</p>
<p><strong>ashoka</strong>: What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: I said, Please, don’t touch her.</p>
<p><strong>ashoka</strong>: She’s going to give someone a lot of
enjoyment. Yes.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: There’s a moment of unbearable tension
as everyone, in- cluding the Goonda, realizes this man is out of
control.</p>
<p><strong>ashoka</strong>: He said ‘please’ didn’t he? ‘Please, don’t
touch her?’</p>
<p><strong>ashoka</strong>: Bhose, help me!</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: Life is hard enough. No more. Leave us
alone.</p>
<p><strong>goonda</strong>: You won’t be bothered again.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Shutters start to open, people begin to
appear again in doorways and windows. Fearing for his life, Ashoka
suddenly bolts. Max is fixed on Hasari. He lets up a scream of exulta-
tion, his hand going out for a “five” from Hasari. The kids charge
toward Hasari. Then everyone freezes. Hasari lists to his right side and
blood starts to pour from the knife wound in his abdomen under his
pressing arm.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Why don’t you go on home. I’ll stay with
him.</p>
<p><strong>int. max’s room - night</strong>: A thin stream of dawn light
coming through the half- closed shutters.</p>
<p><strong>from here - the balcony</strong>: Through the open door, we
can just see Joan, praying quietly. Close around her, Anouar, Meeta,
Surya, Marga- reta, Poomina…</p>
<p><strong>the room</strong>: Beneath “The Raft of the Medusa,” Hasari
Pal speaks to his family and Max, Aloka sitting close to the bed, the
Children on the bed beside their father, and Max standing close.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: A man’s journey to the end of his
obligations is a very long road. And you have to remember that you can
never give up. We pray that life will bless us, that we will be kings,
with possessions and money that we can rule over all around us. But it’s
a mist; the only thing that makes it possible to endure life is our
love, one for the other.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: I was dreaming the sound of rickshaw bells,
and now I hear them.</p>
<p><strong>courtyard - their pov</strong>: Outside, there are rickshaw
pullers filling the courtyard and spilling out into the street. When the
window opens, all the Pullers start ringing their bells and the room is
full of their music.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: Are they here for me?</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: A city so big. When we arrived, we didn’t
have a place to live, a friend.</p>
<p><strong>outside</strong>: The many hands with their ringing
bells.</p>
<p><strong>close on window</strong>: The tiny figure of Shambu joins Max
in the window. Max bends close.</p>
<p><strong>shambu</strong>: Is my father going to die?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Get serious.</p>
<p><strong>int. ram’s hut - hasari’s face - day</strong>: Hasari mirrors
Max’s expression of dismissal!</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: Get serious! I’ve agreed to the bicycle,
I’ve agreed to the 1000 rupees! I can go no further. I have nothing more
to give!</p>
<p><strong>outside the hut</strong>: Everyone crowded around the door.
From within, we DIMLY HEAR the negotiations continue. Max approaches
from the clinic. Shambu slips down the steps from above as…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: How’s it going?</p>
<p><strong>ram</strong>: All that stands between them now is the ounce
of gold. Max Daddah, Joan Di – is she a good reader?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>ram</strong>: She read this letter to me. But I think she
must have read it wrong. She said my wife writes that irrigation has
come to our village.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: But that’s great.</p>
<p><strong>ram</strong>: But it means I should go home to my wife.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I thought that’s why we’ve been writing all
these letters.</p>
<p><strong>ram</strong>: Yes, of course, I love her from here, yes; but,
what if I go home and find I don’t love her from there.</p>
<p><strong>shambu</strong>: Daddy needs gold, right?</p>
<p><strong>close on shambu’s hand</strong>: He opens his hand to
disclose what he scooped off the ground during the fight: Max’s necklace
and Hebrew letter.</p>
<p><strong>shambu</strong>: Do you think this is pretend gold or
real?</p>
<p><strong>max and shambu</strong>: Max stares at the little boy’s
hopeful face.</p>
<p><strong>int. pal’s room - flower</strong>: We see the fully blossomed
flower in the tea caddy and then Hasari’s fingers come INTO THE FRAME.
He carefully snips the flower free of its stalk.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: Amrita is dressed in the beautiful
sari her father bought her. Father and daughter are alone. He hands her
the flower and adjusts her veil tenderly.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: You never did belong to me. You were only
lent to me by God until you marry and continue the wheel of life.</p>
<p><strong>ext. square - day - early evening</strong>: The procession to
the courtyard begins when a BRASS BAND strikes up, accompanied by
singing and shouting. Tiny lights have been strung over the street. We
see Max and Manubai. Margareta and a group of children. Joan with
Poomina. Anour, Meeta, Said. Everyone who’s become part of the family is
present.</p>
<p><strong>ext. clinic courtyard - day</strong>: The procession arrives
and enters. Smoke from the chu- las. Light from a half dozen lamps.
Subash and his procession make their entrance. A ritual veil is fixed to
Subash’s face. The Pujari waves for Hasari to come to his place. Hasari
turns to Max.</p>
<p><strong>hasari</strong>: I would be pleased if you would stand with
me in the place of honor to the right of my daughter.</p>
<p><strong>the ceremony</strong>: A flame. The shyness of bride and
groom as the ceremony proceeds with the winding of the red thread.
Hasari looks on with unspeakable pride, Max beside him. We see the faces
of all our family again: Aloka, Manooj and Shambu, Joan, Poomina, Surya,
Selima, Aristotle John, etc.</p>
<p><strong>the wheel</strong>: Turning. As Amrita and Subash, joined by
the thread, circle the flame… as we PULL BACK AND UP. Now we see the
clinic and school and the surrounding area, the alleys full of people
and activity. As we continue to PULL BACK, we see the entirety of the
City of Joy and then beyond – Calcutta, its teeming streets – life con-
tinuing as the sun sets against an infinite sky and we</p>
