<p><strong>newsreel announcer</strong>: “Movietown News” presents…
Spotlight on Adventure!</p>
<p><strong>newsreel announcer</strong>: What you are now witnessing is
footage never before seen by civilized humanity: a lost world in South
America! Lurking in the shadow of majestic Paradise Falls, it sports
plants and animals undiscovered by science. Who would dare set foot on
this inhospitable summit?</p>
<p><strong>newsreel announcer</strong>: Why, our subject today: Charles
Muntz!</p>
<p><strong>newsreel announcer</strong>: The beloved explorer lands his
dirigible, the “Spirit of Adventure,” in New Hampshire this week,
completing a year long expedition to the lost world!</p>
<p><strong>newsreel announcer</strong>: This lighter-than-air craft was
designed by Muntz himself, and is longer than 22 Prohibition paddy-
wagons placed end to end.</p>
<p><strong>newsreel announcer</strong>: And here comes the adventurer
now!</p>
<p><strong>newsreel footage</strong>: the dashing Muntz descends down
the gangplank to the delight of the crowd. His dogs trail him.</p>
<p><strong>newsreel announcer</strong>: Never apart from his faithful
dogs, Muntz conceived the craft for canine comfort! It’s a veritable
floating palace in the sky…</p>
<p><strong>newsreel announcer</strong>: …complete with doggie bath and
mechanical canine walker.</p>
<p><strong>newsreel announcer</strong>: And Jiminy Cricket, do the
locals consider Muntz the bee’s knees! And how!</p>
<p><strong>muntz</strong>: “Adventure is out there!”</p>
<p><strong>newsreel announcer</strong>: But what has Muntz brought back
this time?</p>
<p><strong>muntz</strong>: Gentlemen, I give you: the Monster of
Paradise Falls!</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: Ooh!</p>
<p><strong>newsreel announcer</strong>: And golly, what a swell monster
this is. But what’s this?</p>
<p><strong>newsreel announcer</strong>: Scientists cry foul! The
National Explorers Society accuses Muntz of fabricating the
skeleton!</p>
<p><strong>young carl</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>newsreel announcer</strong>: The organization strips Muntz of
his membership.</p>
<p><strong>newsreel announcer</strong>: Humiliated, Muntz vows a return
to Paradise Falls and promises to capture the beast… alive!</p>
<p><strong>muntz</strong>: I promise to capture the beast… alive!</p>
<p><strong>muntz</strong>: And I will not come back until I do!</p>
<p><strong>newsreel announcer</strong>: And so the explorer is off to
clear his name. Bon voyage Charles Muntz, and good luck capturing the
Monster of Paradise Falls!</p>
<p><strong>newsreel announcer</strong>: Here’s Charles Muntz piloting
his famous dirigible!!</p>
<p><strong>newsreel announcer</strong>: He hurdles Pike’s Peak!</p>
<p><strong>newsreel announcer</strong>: He hurdles the Grand Canyon!</p>
<p><strong>newsreel announcer</strong>: He hurdles Mount Everest!</p>
<p><strong>newsreel announcer</strong>: He… goes around Mount Everest!
Is there nothing he cannot do?</p>
<p><strong>newsreel announcer</strong>: Yes, as Muntz himself says:
“Adventure is–”</p>
<p><strong>girl’s voice</strong>: “Adventure is out there!”</p>
<p><strong>girl’s voice</strong>: Look out! Mount Rushmore! Hard to
starboard. Must get the Spirit of Adventure over Mount Rushmore…</p>
<p><strong>girl’s voice</strong>: Hold together old girl. How’re my dogs
doing? Ruff ruff!</p>
<p><strong>girl’s voice</strong>: All engines ahead full! Let’s take her
up to 26,000 feet! Rudders eighteen degrees towards the south.</p>
<p><strong>young ellie</strong>: It’s a beautiful day, winds out of the
east at ten knots. Visibility… unlimited. Enter the weather in the
logbook!</p>
<p><strong>young ellie</strong>: Oh! There’s something down there! I
will bring it back for science. Awwww, it’s a puppy!</p>
<p><strong>young ellie</strong>: No time! A storm! Lightning! Hail!</p>
<p><strong>young ellie</strong>: What are you doing!?!</p>
<p><strong>young ellie</strong>: Don’t you know this is an exclusive
club? Only explorers get in here. Not just any kid off the street with a
helmet and a pair of goggles. Do you think you got what it takes? Well,
do you?!?</p>
<p><strong>young ellie</strong>: Alright, you’re in. Welcome aboard.</p>
<p><strong>young ellie</strong>: What’s wrong? Can’t you talk?</p>
<p><strong>young ellie</strong>: Hey, I don’t bite.</p>
<p><strong>young ellie</strong>: You and me, we’re in a club now.</p>
<p><strong>young ellie</strong>: I saw where your balloon went. Come on,
let’s go get it!</p>
<p><strong>young ellie</strong>: My name’s Ellie.</p>
<p><strong>young ellie</strong>: There it is.</p>
<p><strong>young ellie</strong>: Well, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>young ellie</strong>: Go on.</p>
<p><strong>young carl</strong>: Ow!</p>
<p><strong>young ellie</strong>: Hey kid!!</p>
<p><strong>young carl</strong>: Ow!!</p>
<p><strong>young ellie</strong>: Thought you might need a little
cheerin’ up. I got somethin’ to show ya!</p>
<p><strong>young ellie</strong>: I am about to let you see something I
have never shown to another human being. Ever. In my life.</p>
<p><strong>young ellie</strong>: You’ll have to swear you will not tell
anyone.</p>
<p><strong>young ellie</strong>: Cross your heart. Do it!</p>
<p><strong>young ellie</strong>: My Adventure Book!</p>
<p><strong>young ellie</strong>: You know him.</p>
<p><strong>young ellie</strong>: Charles Muntz, explorer. When I get
big, I’m going where he’s going: South America.</p>
<p><strong>young ellie</strong>: It’s like America… but south. Wanna
know where I’m gonna live?</p>
<p><strong>young ellie</strong>: “Paradise Falls, a land lost in time.”
I ripped this right out of a library book.</p>
<p><strong>young ellie</strong>: I’m gonna move my clubhouse there, and
park it right next to the falls. Who knows what lives up there? And once
I get there…</p>
<p><strong>young ellie</strong>: Well, I’m saving these pages for all
the adventures I’m gonna have. Only… I just don’t know how I’m gonna get
to Paradise Falls.</p>
<p><strong>young ellie</strong>: That’s it! You can take us there in a
blimp! Swear you’ll take us. Cross your heart! Cross it! Cross your
heart.</p>
<p><strong>young ellie</strong>: Good. You promised. No backing out.</p>
<p><strong>young ellie</strong>: Well, see you tomorrow kid! Bye.</p>
<p><strong>young ellie</strong>: “Adventure is out there!!”</p>
<p><strong>young ellie</strong>: You know, you don’t talk very much. I
like you.</p>
<p><strong>young carl</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Quite a sight, huh Ellie? Uhp, mail’s
here.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Shady Oaks Retirement. Oh brother.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Hm.</p>
<p><strong>construction foreman tom</strong>: Hey! `Morning,
Mr. Fredricksen! Need any help there?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: No. Yes. Tell your boss over there that you
boys are ruining our house.</p>
<p><strong>construction foreman tom</strong>: Well just to let you know,
my boss would be happy to take this old place off your hands, and for
double his last offer. Whaddya say to that?</p>
<p><strong>construction foreman tom</strong>: Uh, I take that as a no,
then.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I believe I made my position to your boss
quite clear.</p>
<p><strong>construction foreman tom</strong>: You poured prune juice in
his gas tank.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Oh yeah, that was good. Here, let me talk to
him.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: You in the suit. Yes, you. Take a bath,
hippy!</p>
<p><strong>construction foreman tom</strong>: I am not with him! This is
serious. He’s out to get your house!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Tell your boss he can have our house.</p>
<p><strong>construction foreman tom</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: When I’m dead!</p>
<p><strong>construction foreman tom</strong>: I’ll take that as a
maybe!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: “Good afternoon. My name is Russell. And I
am a Wilderness Explorer in Tribe 54, Sweatlodge 12. Are you in need of
any assistance today, sir?”</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: I could help you cross the street.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: I could help you cross your yard.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: I could help you cross your… porch?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Well, I gotta help you cross something.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Uh, no. I’m doing fine.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: “Good afternoon. My name is Russell.”</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Uh… kid…</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: “And I am a Wilderness Explorer in Tribe
54, Sweatlodge 12.”</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Kid. KID!!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: “Are you in need of any assistance today
Sir?”</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Thank you, but I don’t need any help!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Ow.</p>
<p>****: Proceed.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: “Good afternoon. My-”</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: But skip to the end!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: See these? These are my Wilderness Explorer
badges. You may notice one is missing. It’s my Assisting the Elderly
badge. If I get it I will become a Senior Wilderness Explorer!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: “The wilderness must be explored!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: It’s gonna be great! There’s a big
ceremony, and all the dads come, and they pin on our badges…</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: So you want to assist an old person?</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Yep! Then I will be a Senior Wilderness
Explorer!</p>
<p>****: You ever heard of a snipe?</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Snipe?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Bird. Beady eyes. Every night it sneaks in my
yard and gobbles my poor azaleas. I’m elderly and infirm. I can’t catch
it. If only someone could help me…</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Me! Me! I’ll do it!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Oh, I don’t know, it’s awfully crafty. You’d
have to clap your hands three times to lure it in.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: I’ll find it, Mr. Fredricksen!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I think its burrow is two blocks down. If you
go past –</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Two blocks down! Got it!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Sniiiipe! Here Snipey Snipey…</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Bring it back here when you find it!</p>
<p><strong>construction worker steve</strong>: Okay, keep her coming…
And… stop. Stop! STOP!!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: What? Hey! Hey you! What do you think you’re
doing?</p>
<p><strong>construction worker steve</strong>: I am so sorry, sir…</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Don’t touch that!</p>
<p><strong>construction worker steve</strong>: No no, let me take care
of that for you.</p>
<p>****: Get away from our mailbox!</p>
<p><strong>construction worker steve</strong>: Hey sir, I…</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I don’t want you to touch it!</p>
<p><strong>officer edith</strong>: Sorry Mr. Fredricksen. You don’t seem
like a public menace to me. Take this.</p>
<p><strong>officer edith</strong>: The guys from Shady Oaks will be by
to pick you up in the morning, okay?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: What do I do now, Ellie?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Morning gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>nurse george</strong>: Good morning, Mr. Fredricksen. You
ready to go?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Ready as I’ll ever be. Would you do me a favor
and take this?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I’ll meet you at the van in just a minute. I…
want to say one last goodbye to the old place.</p>
<p><strong>nurse george</strong>: Sure. Take all the time you need,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>nurse a.j.</strong>: Typical. He’s probably going to the
bathroom for the eightieth time.</p>
<p><strong>nurse george</strong>: You’d think he’d take better care of
his house.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: So long boys! I’ll send you a postcard from
Paradise Falls!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: We’re on our way, Ellie.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Hm.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Hi, Mr. Fredricksen. It’s me, Russell.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: What are you doing out here, kid?</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: I found the snipe and I followed it under
your porch, but this snipe had a long tail and looked more like a large
mouse.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Please let me in?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Oh, alright, you can come…</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: …in.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Huh. I’ve never been in a floating house
before.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Goggles. Look at this stuff!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Wow, you going on a trip? “Paradise Falls:
A Land Lost in Time.” You going to South America, Mr. Fredricksen?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Don’t touch that. You’ll soil it.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: You know, most people take a plane, but
you’re smart because you’ll have all your TV and clocks and stuff.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Whoah. Is this how you steer your house?
Does it really work?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Kid, would you stop with the –</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Oh, this makes it go right, and that way’s
left.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Let go of the – knock it off!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Hey look, buildings!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: That building’s so close I could almost
touch it.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Wow! This is great! You should try this,
Mr. Fredricksen! Look, there’s a bus that could take me home two blocks
away! Hey, I can see your house from here!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Don’t jerk around so much, kid!</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: Carl stands beside Russell at the window.
Russell’s fall had been a daydream.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Well, that’s not gonna work.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: I know that cloud, it’s a Cumulo Nimbus.
Did you know that the Cumulo Nimbus…</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Stayed up all night blowing up balloons, for
what?</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: …warm air goes by cool air, and the airs go
by each other and that’s how we get lightning.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: That’s nice, kid.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Mr. Fredricksen, there’s a big storm
coming. It’s starting to get scary. We’re gonna get blown to bits! We’re
in big trouble, Mr. Fredricksen!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: What are you doing over there?</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Look!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: See? Cumulo Nimbus.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: My pack!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Got ya!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Whew! I thought you were dead.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Wha… what happened?</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: I steered us. I did! I steered the
house!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Steered us?</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: After you tied your stuff down you took a
nap, so I went ahead and steered us down here.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Can’t tell where we are.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Oh we’re in South America all right. It was
a cinch, with my Wilderness Explorer GPS.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: GP-what?</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: My dad gave it to me. It shows exactly
where we are on the planet. With this baby, we’ll never be lost!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Oops.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: We’ll get you down, find a bus stop. You just
tell the man you want to go back to your mother.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Sure, but I don’t think they have busses in
Paradise Falls.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: There. That ought to do it. Here, I’ll give
you some change for bus fare.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Nah, I’ll just use my city bus pass.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Whoah, that’s gonna be like a billion
transfers to get back to my house.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Mr. Fredricksen, how much longer?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Well, we’re up pretty high. Could take hours
to get down.</p>
<p>****: …that thing was…building or something.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: What was that, Mr. Fredricksen?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: We can’t be close to the ground yet.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Wait, wait! No don’t, don’t, don’t!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Whoah! Hey, hey!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Russell, hang on!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Whoah!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Walk back! Walk back!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Okay!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Where… where are we?</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: This doesn’t look like the city or the
jungle, Mr. Fredricksen.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Don’t worry, Ellie. I got it.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: There it is. Ellie, it’s so beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: We made it. We made it! Russell, we could
float right over there. Climb up. Climb up!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: You mean assist you?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yeah, yeah. Whatever.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Okay, I’ll climb up!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Watch it.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Now, when you get up there, go ahead and hoist
me up! Got it?!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: You on the porch yet?!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: What? That’s it?! I came all this way just to
get stuck at the wrong end of this rock pile? Aw, great!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Hey, if I could assist you over there,
would you sign off on my badge?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: We could walk your house to the falls!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Walk it?</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Yeah, after all, we weigh it down. We could
walk it right over there. Like a parade balloon.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Now, we’re gonna walk to the falls quickly and
quietly, with no rap music or flash-dancing.</p>
<p>****: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: We have three days, at best, before the helium
leaks out of those balloons. And if we’re not at the falls when that
happens…</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Sand!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: …we’re not getting to the falls!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: I found sand!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Don’t you worry, Ellie. We’ll get our house
over there.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Huh. This is fun already, isn’t it? By the
time we get there, you’re gonna feel so assisted… Oh, Mr. Fredricksen,
if we happen to get separated, use the Wilderness Explorer call. Caw
caw, raaar!!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Wait. Why are we going to Paradise Falls
again?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Hey, let’s play a game. It’s called: “See who
can be quiet the longest.”</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Cool! My mom loves that game!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Darn thing. C’mon, Russell, would you hurry it
up?</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: I’m tiiiired. And my knee hurts.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Which knee?</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: My elbow hurts and I have to go to the
bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I asked you about that five minutes ago!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Well, I didn’t have to go then!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: I don’t want to walk anymore. Can we
stop?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Russell! If you don’t hurry up, the tigers
will eat you.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: There’s no tigers in South America.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Zoology.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Oh, for the love of Pete. Go on into the
bushes and do your business.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Okay! Here, hold my stuff.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: I’ve always wanted to try this!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Mr. Fredricksen? Am I supposed to dig the
hole before or after?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Eugh! None of my concern!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Oh. It’s before!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Huh? Tracks?!</p>
<p>****: Snipe!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Here, snipe… Come on out, snipe. Snipe!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Huh.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Ha! Gotcha!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Don’t be afraid, little snipe. I am a
Wilderness Explorer so I am a friend to all of nature. Want some
more?</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Hi boy. Don’t eat it all. Come on out.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Come on. Don’t be afraid little snipe. Nice
snipe. Good little snipe. Nice…</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: …giant snipe!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: I found the snipe!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Oh, did you?</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Are they tall?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Oh yes, they’re very tall.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Do they have a lot of colors?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: They do indeed.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Do they like chocolate?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Oh ye- Chocolate?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: What is that thing?!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: It’s a snipe!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: There’s no such thing as a snipe!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: But you said snipes eat–</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Whoah!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Go on, get out of here. Go on! Shoo!</p>
<p>****: Whoah! Whoah!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Careful, Russell!</p>
<p>****: Hey, look Mr. Fredricksen, it likes me!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Russell!</p>
<p>****: No stop, that tickles!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Get out of here. Go on, git!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Aaaah!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Uh-oh! No no no no no Kevin, it’s okay.
Mr. Fredricksen is nice!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: “Kevin”?</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Yeah, that’s his name I just gave him.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Hey. Beat it! Vamoose! Scram!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Hey! That’s mine!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Aaah! Shoo, shoo! Get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Go on, beat it.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Can we keep him? Please?? I’ll get the food
for him, I’ll walk him, I’ll change his newspapers…</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: No.</p>
<p>****: “An Explorer is a friend to all, be it plants or fish or tiny
mole.”</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: That doesn’t even rhyme.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Yeah it does.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Hey, look! Kevin!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: What? Get down! You’re not allowed up
there!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: You come down here right now!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Sheesh! Can you believe this, Ellie?</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Ellie?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: But I told him no – I told you no! N-O.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I see you back there!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Go on, get out of here. Shoo! Go annoy someone
else for a while.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Hey, are you okay over there?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Uh, hello?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Oh! Hello sir! Thank goodness.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: It’s nice to know someone else is up here!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I can smell you.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: What? You can smell us?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I can smell you.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: You were talking to a rock.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Hey, that one looks like a turtle!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Look at that one! That one looks like a
dog!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: It is a dog!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Uh, we’re not allowed to have dogs in my
apartment.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Hey, I like dogs!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: We have your dog! Wonder who he belongs
to?</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Sit boy.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Hey look, he’s trained! Shake!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Uh-huh. Speak.</p>
<p><strong>dug</strong>: Hi there.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Did that dog just say “Hi there?”</p>
<p><strong>dug</strong>: Oh yes.</p>
<p><strong>dug</strong>: My name is Dug. I have just met you and I love
you.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Uh..wha?</p>
<p><strong>dug</strong>: My master made me this collar. He is a good and
smart master and he made me this collar so that I may talk –
SQUIRREL!!</p>
<p><strong>dug</strong>: My master is good and smart.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: It’s not possible.</p>
<p><strong>dug</strong>: Oh it is, because my master is smart.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Cool! What do these do, boy?</p>
<p><strong>dug</strong>: Hey would you-</p>
<p>****: -cuerdo con tigo-</p>
<p>****: I use that collar-</p>
<p>****: -watashi wa hanashi ma-</p>
<p>****: -to talk with, I would be happy if you stopped.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Russell, don’t touch that. It could be
radioactive or something.</p>
<p><strong>dug</strong>: I am a great tracker. My pack sent me on a
special mission all by myself. Have you seen a bird? I want to find one
and I have been on the scent. I am a great tracker, did I mention
that?</p>
<p><strong>dug</strong>: Hey, that is the bird! I have never seen one up
close but this is the bird. May I take your bird back to camp as my
prisoner?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yes! Take it! And on the way, learn how to
bark like a real dog!</p>
<p><strong>dug</strong>: Oh I can bark!</p>
<p><strong>dug</strong>: And here’s howling!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Can we keep him? Please please please?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: But it’s a talking dog!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: It’s just a weird trick or something. Let’s
get to the falls.</p>
<p><strong>dug</strong>: Please be my prisoner. Oh please oh please be
my prisoner.</p>
<p><strong>gamma</strong>: Oh, here it is. I picked up the bird’s
scent!</p>
<p><strong>beta</strong>: Wait a minute, wait a minute! What is this?
Chocolate. I smell chocolate.</p>
<p><strong>gamma</strong>: I’m getting prunes and denture cream! Who are
they?</p>
<p><strong>beta</strong>: Ah man, Master will not be pleased. We’d
better tell him someone took the bird, right Alpha?</p>
<p><strong>alpha</strong>: No. Soon enough the bird will be ours yet
again.</p>
<p><strong>alpha</strong>: Find the scent, my compadres and you two
shall have much rewardings from Master for the toil factor you wage.</p>
<p><strong>beta</strong>: Hey Alpha, I think there’s something wrong
with your collar. You must have bumped it.</p>
<p><strong>gamma</strong>: Yeah, your voice sounds funny!</p>
<p><strong>alpha</strong>: Beta. Gamma. Mayhaps you desire to –
SQUIRREL!</p>
<p><strong>alpha</strong>: Mayhaps you desire to challenge the ranking
that I have been assigned by my strength and cunning?</p>
<p><strong>beta</strong>: No no. But maybe Dug would. You might want to
ask him.</p>
<p><strong>gamma</strong>: Yeah, I wonder if he’s found the bird on his
very special mission.</p>
<p><strong>alpha</strong>: Do not mention Dug to me at this time. His
fool’s errand will keep him most occupied, most occupied indeed. Ha ha
ha. Do you not agree with that which I am saying to you now?</p>
<p><strong>beta</strong>: Sure, but the second Master finds out you sent
Dug out by himself, none of us will get a treat.</p>
<p><strong>alpha</strong>: You are wise, my trusted Lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>alpha</strong>: This is Alpha calling Dug. Come in, Dug.</p>
<p><strong>dug</strong>: Hi Alpha. Hey, your voice sounds funny.</p>
<p><strong>alpha</strong>: I know, I know! Have you seen the bird?</p>
<p><strong>dug</strong>: Why yes, the bird is my prisoner now.</p>
<p><strong>gamma</strong>: Yeah, right.</p>
<p><strong>alpha</strong>: Impossible! Where are you?!</p>
<p><strong>dug</strong>: I am here with the bird and I will bring it
back and then you will like me. Oh, gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Hey Dug! Who you talking to?</p>
<p><strong>beta</strong>: What’s Dug doing?</p>
<p><strong>gamma</strong>: Why’s he with that small mailman?</p>
<p><strong>beta</strong>: Where are they?</p>
<p><strong>alpha</strong>: There he is. Come on!</p>
<p><strong>dug</strong>: Oh please oh please oh PLEASE be my
prisoner!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Dug, stop bothering Kevin!</p>
<p><strong>dug</strong>: That man there says I can take the bird and I
love that man there like he is my master.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I am not your master!</p>
<p><strong>dug</strong>: I am warning you, once again, bird!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Hey! Quit it!</p>
<p><strong>dug</strong>: I am jumping on you now, bird.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Russell! At this rate we’ll never get to the
falls!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I am nobody’s master, got it? I don’t want you
here, …and I don’t want you here. I’m stuck with you. And if you two
don’t clear out of here by the time I count to three-</p>
<p><strong>dug</strong>: A ball! Oh boy oh boy! A ball!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Ball?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: You want it boy? Huh? Huh? Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>dug</strong>: Oh oh oh! Yes, I do. I do ever so want the
ball!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Go get it!!</p>
<p><strong>dug</strong>: Oh boy, oh boy! I will get it and then bring it
back!</p>
<p>****: Quick Russell, give me some chocolate.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Just give it to me!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Bird. Bird!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: C’mon Russell!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Wait. Wait, Mr. Fredricksen.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Daah!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Aaahh…</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: What are we doing?</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Hey, uh, we’re pretty far now. Kevin’s
gonna miss me.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I think that did the trick.</p>
<p><strong>dug</strong>: Hi, Master.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Well, thanks for keeping us dry anyway,
Ellie.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Which one’s the front?</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Is this step three, or step five?</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: There!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: All done.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: That’s for you!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Awh. Tents are hard.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Wait, aren’t you “Super Wilderness Guy?” With
the GPM’s and the badges?</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Yeah, but… can I tell you a secret?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Alright, here goes. I never actually built
a tent before. There. I said it.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: You’ve been camping before, haven’t you?</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Well, never outside.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Well, why didn’t you ask your Dad how to build
a tent?</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: I don’t think he wants to talk about this
stuff.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Why don’t you try him sometime? Maybe he’ll
surprise you.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Well, he’s away a lot. I don’t see him
much.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: He’s got to be home sometime.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Well, I called, but Phyllis told me I bug
him too much.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Phyllis? You call your own mother by her first
name?</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Phyllis isn’t my mom.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: But he promised he’d come to my Explorer
ceremony to pin on my Assisting the Elderly badge, so he can show me
about tents then, right?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Hey, uh, why don’t you get some sleep. Don’t
want to wake up the traveling flea circus.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Mr. Fredricksen, Dug says he wants to take
Kevin prisoner. We have to protect him!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Can Kevin go with us?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Alright. He can come.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Promise you won’t leave him?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Cross your heart?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Cross my heart.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: What have I got myself into, Ellie?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Morning Sweetheart.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: We better get moving.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Huh. Bird’s gone. Maybe Russell won’t notice.
Alright, everybody up!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Where’s Kevin? He’s wandered off! Kevin!
Dug, find Kevin!</p>
<p><strong>dug</strong>: Find the bird. Find the bird…</p>
<p><strong>point!</strong>: Dug goes rigid like a pointer dog and
“points” to the left.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Oh, look! There he is.</p>
<p><strong>point!</strong>: The bird has gathered a pile of food on
Carl’s roof.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Hey, that’s my food! Get off my roof!</p>
<p><strong>dug</strong>: Yeah, get off of his !</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: What is it doing?</p>
<p><strong>dug</strong>: The bird is calling to her babies.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Her babies! Kevin’s a girl?</p>
<p><strong>dug</strong>: Her house is over there in those twisty
rocks.</p>
<p><strong>dug</strong>: She has been gathering food for her babies and
must get back to them.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Wait, Kevin’s just leaving? But you
promised to protect her!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Her babies need her, we gotta make sure
they’re together.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Sorry Russell. We’ve lost enough time
already.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: This was her favorite chocolate. Because
you sent her away, there’s more for you.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Kevin?</p>
<p><strong>alpha</strong>: Where’s the bird? You said you had the
bird.</p>
<p><strong>dug</strong>: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Since I have said that, I can
see how you would think that.</p>
<p><strong>alpha</strong>: Where is it?</p>
<p><strong>dug</strong>: Uh, tomorrow. Come back tomorrow and then I
will again have the bird. Yes.</p>
<p><strong>alpha</strong>: You lost it. Why do I not have a surprised
feeling? Well, at least you now have lead us to the small mailman and
The One Who Smells of Prunes.</p>
<p><strong>alpha</strong>: Master will be most pleased we have found
them, and will ask of them many questions. Come!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Wait, we’re not going with you. We’re going to
the falls!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Get away from me! Get down!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Stay!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You came here in that?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Uh… yeah.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: In a house? A floating house?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: That is the darndest thing I’ve ever seen!
You’re not after my bird, are you? But if you need to borrow a cup of
sugar, I’d be happy to oblige!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Well, this is all a misunderstanding. My dogs
made a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Wait, are you Charles Muntz?!</p>
<p><strong>muntz</strong>: Well… Yes.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: The Charles Muntz?</p>
<p><strong>muntz</strong>: “Adventure is out there!”</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: It’s really him! That’s Charles Muntz!</p>
<p>****: It is?!?</p>
<p>****: Who’s Charles Muntz?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Him!</p>
<p><strong>dog walla</strong>: Yes! It is him! He is!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I’m Carl Fredricksen. My wife and I, we were
your biggest fans!</p>
<p><strong>muntz</strong>: Well, you’re a man of good taste!</p>
<p><strong>muntz</strong>: You must be tired. Hungry?</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>muntz</strong>: Attention everyone! These people are no
longer intruders. They are our guests.</p>
<p><strong>dog walla</strong>: Follow me! I like you temporarily. You do
smell like prunes. I will not bite you.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p><strong>muntz</strong>: I’m sorry about the dogs – hope they weren’t
too rough on you.</p>
<p><strong>gamma</strong>: We weren’t!</p>
<p><strong>muntz</strong>: Go ahead and moor your airship right next to
mine.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: We’re not actually going inside the “Spirit of
Adventure” itself?!</p>
<p><strong>muntz</strong>: Oh. Would you like to?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Would I?!?!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Wait up, Mr. Muntz!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Jiminy Cricket.</p>
<p><strong>beta</strong>: Not you.</p>
<p><strong>gamma</strong>: What do we do with Dug?</p>
<p><strong>alpha</strong>: He has lost the bird. Put him in the Cone of
Shame.</p>
<p><strong>dug</strong>: I do not like the Cone of Shame.</p>
<p><strong>muntz</strong>: Most of the collection is housed in the
world’s top museums: New York, Munich, London… `Course I kept the best
for myself.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Did you ever! Will you look at that?</p>
<p><strong>muntz</strong>: Oh yes, the Arsinoitherium. Beast charged
while I was brushing my teeth. Used my shaving kit to bring him
down.</p>
<p><strong>muntz</strong>: Oh, surprise me. Only way to get it out of
Ethiopia at the time was to have it declared as “dental equipment!”</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Oh my gosh, the Giant Somalian Leopard
Tortoise!</p>
<p><strong>muntz</strong>: Oh, you recognize it? I’m impressed! That’s
an interesting story there…</p>
<p><strong>muntz</strong>: Hm, excellent choice. I found it on safari
with Roosevelt.</p>
<p><strong>muntz</strong>: He and I fell into a habit of playing gin
rummy in the evenings. And did he cheat? Oh, he was horrible!</p>
<p><strong>alpha</strong>: Master, dinner is ready.</p>
<p><strong>muntz</strong>: Oh dear, broken translator. It’s that loose
wire again. There you go big fella.</p>
<p><strong>alpha</strong>: Thank you Master.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: I liked his other voice.</p>
<p><strong>muntz</strong>: Well, dinner is served! Right this way.</p>
<p><strong>muntz</strong>: So how are things stateside? Almost tempted
to go back a few times, but I have unfinished work here… Please.</p>
<p><strong>muntz</strong>: I hope you’re hungry because Epsilon is the
finest chef I’ve ever had.</p>
<p><strong>muntz</strong>: Oh, Epsilon, you’ve done it again!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Yes!!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Oh my Ellie would have loved all this. You
know, it’s because of you she had this dream to come down here and live
by Paradise Falls.</p>
<p><strong>muntz</strong>: I’m honored. And now you’ve made it!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: You’re sure we’re not a bother? I’d hate to
impose.</p>
<p><strong>muntz</strong>: No no! It’s a pleasure to have guests – a
real treat.</p>
<p><strong>dog walla</strong>: Treat?! Treat! I want a treat!</p>
<p><strong>muntz</strong>: No no, quiet! Calm down. Calm down…</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p>****: Shouldn’t’ve used that word… Having guests is a delight. More
often I get thieves, come to steal what’s rightfully mine.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>muntz</strong>: They called me a fraud, those… dah! But once
I bring back this creature, my name will be cleared.</p>
<p><strong>muntz</strong>: Beautiful, isn’t it? I’ve spent a lifetime
tracking it. Sometimes years go by between sightings…</p>
<p><strong>muntz</strong>: And here they come, these bandits, and think
the bird is theirs to take! But they soon find that this mountain is a
very dangerous place.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Hey, that looks like Kevin!</p>
<p><strong>muntz</strong>: “Kevin?”</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Yeah! That’s my new giant bird pet. I
trained it to follow us.</p>
<p><strong>muntz</strong>: Follow you? Impossible. How?</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: She likes chocolate.</p>
<p><strong>muntz</strong>: Chocolate?</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Yeah, I gave her some of my chocolate. She
goes ga-ga for it.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: But it ran off! It’s gone now.</p>
<p><strong>muntz</strong>: You know, Carl. These people who pass through
here, they all tell pretty good stories. A “Surveyor” making a map.</p>
<p><strong>muntz</strong>: A “Botanist” cataloguing plants.</p>
<p><strong>muntz</strong>: An old man taking his house to Paradise
Falls.</p>
<p><strong>muntz</strong>: That’s the best one yet. I can’t wait to hear
how it ends.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Well! It’s been a wonderful evening, but we’d
better be going.</p>
<p><strong>muntz</strong>: Oh, you’re not leaving?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: We don’t want to take advantage of your
hospitality. Come on Russell.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: But we haven’t even had dessert yet.</p>
<p><strong>muntz</strong>: No, the boy’s right. You haven’t had dessert.
Epsilon here makes a delicious Cherries Jubilee.</p>
<p><strong>muntz</strong>: Oh, you really must stay. I insist! We have
so much more to talk about!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Kevin?</p>
<p><strong>muntz</strong>: It’s here.</p>
<p><strong>muntz</strong>: Get them!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Hurry!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: I am hurrying!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: They’re coming!</p>
<p><strong>dug</strong>: Master, over here!</p>
<p><strong>dug</strong>: Go toward the light, master!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Russell!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Get back!!</p>
<p><strong>dug</strong>: Go on Master! I will stop the dogs!</p>
<p><strong>dug</strong>: Stop you dogs!!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Help! Help!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Gimme your hand!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Hang on to Kevin!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Kevin!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: No no no! Kevin! Stay down. She’s hurt real
bad. Can’t we help her get home?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Alright. But we’ve got to hurry.</p>
<p><strong>muntz</strong>: You lost them?</p>
<p><strong>beta</strong>: Uh, it was Dug.</p>
<p><strong>gamma</strong>: Yeah, he’s with them. He helped them
escape!</p>
<p><strong>muntz</strong>: Wait. Wait a minute. Dug…</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: See anything?</p>
<p><strong>dug</strong>: No, my pack is not following us! Boy they are
dumb.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: This is crazy. I finally meet my childhood
hero and he’s trying to kill us! What a joke.</p>
<p><strong>dug</strong>: Hey, I know a joke. A squirrel walks up to a
tree and says I forgot to store acorns for winter and now I am dead. Ha!
It is funny because the squirrel gets dead.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Careful Russell.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: You okay, Kevin?</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: You know what, Mr. Fredricksen? The
wilderness isn’t quite what I expected.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yeah? How so?</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: It’s kinda… wild. I mean, it’s not how they
made it sound in my book.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Hmm, get used to that, kid.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: My dad made it sound so easy. He’s really
good at camping, and how to make fire from rocks and stuff. He used to
come to all my Sweatlodge meetings.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: And afterwards we’d go get ice cream at
Fentons. I always get chocolate and he gets butter- brickle. Then we’d
sit on this one curb, right outside, and I’ll count all the blue cars
and he counts all the red ones, and whoever gets the most, wins. I like
that curb.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: That might sound boring, but I think the
boring stuff is the stuff I remember the most.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Look, there it is!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Hold on Russell, stand still!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Look at that bird go!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Wait up, you overgrown chicken!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: That’s it, go Kevin! Go find your
babies!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Run Kevin! Run!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Oh no!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Russell, give me your knife!</p>
<p><strong>muntz</strong>: Get away from my bird!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>muntz</strong>: Careful. We want her in good shape for my
return.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Let her go! Stop!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Kevin!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: You gave away Kevin. You just gave her
away.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: This is none of my concern. I didn’t ask for
