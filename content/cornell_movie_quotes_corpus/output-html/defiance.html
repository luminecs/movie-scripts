<p><strong>1 new york city - park avenue - night - 1982 1</strong>: A
TAXI pulls over to a curb where an ELDERLY MAN waits with his
MIDDLE-AGED SON in THE RAIN.</p>
<p><strong>middle-aged son</strong>: 23rd and Lex. The CABBIE grunts a
reply.</p>
<p><strong>middle-aged son</strong>: How ya doin’, Papa, you doin’
alright?</p>
<p><strong>elderly man</strong>: Fine, fine…</p>
<p><strong>middle-aged son</strong>: This is just a check-up, okay?
Doctor Katz says you’ll outlive us all. Traffic isn’t bad. We should be
back in time to watch the Mets. He notices his father is STARING,
wide-eyed, at the cabby’s HACK LICENSE. We glimpse only the last
name…“Bielski.”</p>
<p><strong>middle-aged son</strong>: Papa? .Papa, what is it? IN THE
REAR VIEW MIRROR, the old man catches the furtive eyes of the cabby.</p>
<p><strong>elderly man</strong>: …You. Can it be? The eyes in the mirror
look away. And then back.</p>
<p><strong>elderly man</strong>: Bielski. Can it possibly be? As we PUSH
IN on the eyes in the mirror, we HEAR THE</p>
<p><strong>2 a man running for his life through the woods. 2</strong>:
Bombs EXPLODE all around as he passes dead bodies and BURNT- OUT
VEHICLES. Without slowing he discards a WW II Red Army helmet, a field
jacket, a heavy pack, anything that might impede his flight. He glances
back up over his shoulder. The sky is filled with BOMBERS. He runs
on.</p>
<p><strong>4 the village of naliboki 4</strong>: A typical Eastern
European shtetl. LOCAL POLICE help German Einsatzgruppen, mobile killing
squads, round up Jews. PEASANTS beat them with sticks as they are herded
into lines. One man tries to run and is beaten. Others look on, or look
away with indifference as they are loaded onto waiting trucks.</p>
<p><strong>5 two men hide in the nearby woods 5</strong>: We study their
faces: a turbulent portrait of impotent rage, terrible fear,
overwhelming grief, and secret relief.</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: Where are they taking them?</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: –Shveig! Shveig!</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Just shut up! Please…</p>
<p><strong>6 an alley way in novagrudok 6</strong>: The man we last saw
in flight wearing the remnants of his uniform, slips down a
cobble-stoned street. He ducks into a doorway as A PATROL passes by.</p>
<p><strong>6a a remote farm 6a</strong>: Zus and Asael move warily
through a barnyard. A tethered dog BARKS furiously. A farmer challenges
them.</p>
<p><strong>what do you want?</strong>: Walencki brandishes a
pitchfork.</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: Some food…?</p>
<p><strong>walencki</strong>: They are looking for you people. The two
brothers glance nervously around.</p>
<p><strong>walencki</strong>: Get away from here! GO! ZUS, the older of
the two brothers, takes a menacing step toward the farmer but his
younger brother holds him back.</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: Zus. Let’s go. As they retreat toward the
woods, Zus warns the farmer.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: We’ll be back.</p>
<p><strong>7 a bourgeois apartment – day 7</strong>: Tuvia is getting
dressed as AN ATTRACTIVE WOMAN – his wife, RIFKA – stands by the window,
smoking a cigarette.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: And no news of my brothers?</p>
<p><strong>rifka</strong>: They are used to trouble, they’ll be all
right.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: If you stay, you’ll have to go to the
ghetto.</p>
<p><strong>rifka</strong>: I can get false papers and pass as a gentile.
So can you. Tuvia shakes his head, no. He finishes dressing. Theirs is a
relationship long past passion.</p>
<p><strong>rifka</strong>: Will you at least stay tonight?</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: I need to see to my family. Will you
come?</p>
<p><strong>rifka</strong>: To the country? No.</p>
<p><strong>8 a modest mill - later that day 8</strong>: A PAIR OF LEGS
lie motionless behind a trough. Beyond, A MAN’S TORSO. Zus and Asael
stare in mute horror.</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: Papa– Gottenyu… Flies buzz about dead
LIVESTOCK. A WOMAN’S BODY lies nearby.</p>
<p><strong>9 in the house 9</strong>: A still portrait of a life
interrupted.</p>
<p><strong>9 continued: 9</strong>: A table set for dinner. Candles lit.
An open book. A NOISE from a cupboard. Zus grabs a hatchet. From the
root cellar, a YOUNG BOY, 14, appears. His face is dirty and
tear-streaked. They go to embrace him.</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: Aron. The boy recoils. He is disoriented and
WILL NOT</p>
<p><strong>10 the forest at dusk 10</strong>: Aron stares mutely
straight ahead. Asael is shaking uncontrollably and crying. Zus is at a
loss what to do.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Stop it… But Asael is lost in a confusion of
grief and panic.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Stop it. STOP IT! Finally Zus grabs him in a
gesture halfway between violence and comfort…and holds him as Asael
rocks back and forth.</p>
<p><strong>11 the naliboki forest at dawn - viewed from above
11</strong>: A million acres of dense, impenetrable woods and
swamps.</p>
<p><strong>12 asael and aron sleep huddled on the ground 12</strong>:
The sound of a FOOTSTEP. They sit up in terror.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: If I was a German you are dead.</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: Tuvia! Asael leaps up to embrace him as if he
were salvation itself.</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: Papa and Mama. They killed them.</p>
<p><strong>12 continued: 12</strong>: Asael clings to him. Even Aron
allows himself to be held. Tuvia hold them silently. Zus appears,
hatchet in hand.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Big brother returns. Tuvia and Zus look at each
other warily.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: You saw them? Yes. Tuvia saw them. Zus takes
the mezuzah from his pocket, tosses it to Tuvia.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Welcome home.</p>
<p><strong>13 later - the nalibocki forest - a loaf of stale bread
13</strong>: is torn apart by filthy hands as they move through the
trees.</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: Are you going back to the army?</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: There is no more army. Asael worships his big
brother.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Hope at least you killed a few. Tuvia just
stares at him.</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: What is it like? To be in a war?</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: It wasn’t war. It was something else. Zus
eyes him carefully.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Where is Sonia and the baby?</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Horodysze. Hiding in a cellar. I’ll bring her
when it is safe. Where is Rifka?</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: In Novgrudok. She wouldn’t leave.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: You are still separated?</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: She is still my wife.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Your rich wife. Zus chews with the open-mouthed
relish of a peasant.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: So why exactly have you come back? Tuvia just
stares at him. The reason is obvious as he holds his younger
brothers.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: You have a plan?</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: No. Do you?</p>
<p><strong>14 pouring rain - a new hide-out 14</strong>: Shivering and
miserable, they are trying to start a fire. Asael’s few remaining
matches are sodden.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Is there anything left to eat? Only a few
potatoes in Asael’s bag. WORMS writhe among them.</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: Zus finished the last of the sausage. Tuvia
glares at Zus, who glares back. Sibling rivals.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Stankowicz’ farm is closest.</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: He has dogs.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Fuck the dogs. Wilencki then.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: You think Wilencki is going to give us
food?</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: No. We take it.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: We…Take…It.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: And he tells the police.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: I have run from the police my whole life. Do
you really think it’s a good time to stop? A moment of decision. Who
holds the balance of power?</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: We know these woods. They’ll never find us in
here. Tuvia looks at his brothers. He has been outvoted.</p>
<p><strong>15 the small farmhouse 15</strong>: where Zus and Asael first
tried to get food. Asael waits outside, anxiously on guard.</p>
<p><strong>16 inside 16</strong>: The farmer who threatened them with
the pitchfork sits eating a simple dinner. Zus and Tuvia burst in. Zus
brandishes a hoe.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: We want food. Be quick about it!</p>
<p><strong>walencki</strong>: You again!</p>
<p><strong>walencki</strong>: Sure, sure. Take what you want… Tuvia
begins to stuff provisions into a sack.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Where is your gun, farmer?</p>
<p><strong>walencki</strong>: I have no gun. Zus grabs a dinner plate
and SMASHES IT IN THE FARMER’S</p>
<p><strong>where is your gun?</strong>: Holding his bloody face, the
farmer cowers in fear.</p>
<p><strong>walencki</strong>: Please… Zus kicks him.</p>
<p><strong>walencki</strong>: I beg you…</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: He’s lying. He kicks him again. The farmer
begins to weep.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: You’re lying! Zus dumps the remains of the
farmer’s dinner onto him.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: If I hit you once more, you will shit your
pants. Twice and you will never shit again. The farmer knows Zus won’t
hesitate.</p>
<p><strong>walencki</strong>: Up there… Zus kicks the man aside. Above
the stove is an old rifle. Zus grabs it, points it at the farmer.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: We were never here.</p>
<p><strong>17 the brothers 17</strong>: running through the woods. Zus
raises the rifle in triumph.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: He was willing to help us.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: He’s lucky I didn’t crush his head.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Fucking Polack. I’ve eaten shit from these
people long enough!</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: This is your plan? To terrorize every
anti-Semite in Belorussia?</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: No. Some I will kill.</p>
<p><strong>18 another part of the forest 18</strong>: Aron has been left
alone. He holds a STICK which he “shoots” like a gun – kachew – as he
creeps from tree to tree. Aron freezes. SOMETHING is moving in the
trees. He crouches. A dark blur. An animal? It moves off. He follows.
The shape appears again. It’s a SMALL GIRL, roughly Aron’s age. Aron
waves at her. The girl stares, then runs off. Aron hurries after her
into a wooded grove, then stops short.</p>
<p><strong>a pile of naked corpses.</strong>: Overflows a newly-dug
trench. The small girl runs to A MIDDLE-AGED MAN with a crude
Star-of-David sewn to his tattered coat. He holds an OLDER GIRL, 14, in
his arms. Nearby, three or four OTHERS emerge from hiding. Starved, in
tatters, the living waiting to die.</p>
<p><strong>19 a clearing - later 19</strong>: where the three brothers
gorge themselves on stolen food. Someone FARTS loudly.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Ah…</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: You know what Papa would do when you did that
at table… Tuvia smacks Zus on the head, taking on a gruff voice.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Peasant.</p>
<p><strong>19 continued: 19</strong>: Tuvia imitates his father’s
criticism of Zus. Asael laughs. Zus can’t help but laugh as well. Even
in grief there is laughter. A glimpse of ties that bind them.</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: I can’t believe Papa’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Bernicki.</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: The police captain?</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: We don’t know he did it.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: He always had it in for Papa.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: We don’t know he did it.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: So we will go and ask him if he did.</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: Koscik has a pistol. He showed it to me
once.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: One pistol isn’t enough. We need rifles.
Machine guns.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Machine guns? You’re going to take on the
whole German army?</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Just because you didn’t… The SOUND of
footsteps. Zus jumps up cocking the rifle. ARON emerges from the trees.
And then, behind him, THE SURVIVORS he discovered among the corpses. THE
MIDDLE-AGED MAN holds a teenage GIRL by one hand and carries his younger
daughter.</p>
<p><strong>middle-aged man</strong>: The child is hurt. The brothers
stare at him. Wary and unwelcoming.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Set her down. The man lowers the child to the
ground. She isn’t moving.</p>
<p><strong>middle-aged man</strong>: I am Avram Rubinski. This is my
daughter. She– The Germans–</p>
<p><strong>19 continued: 19</strong>: He cannot bring himself to say the
words. OTHERS shuffle forward, still in shock, barely able to speak
their gratitude as Tuvia offers chunks of bread and cheese. The man
tries to feed his daughter. She is barely alive. Asael turns to Aron.
Gently.</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: Where did you find them? Aron still won’t
speak. Asael addresses the other girl.</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: Your sister is sick?</p>
<p><strong>little girl</strong>: They kept her for a week. We fill in
the rest.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia–</strong>: Zus has moved out of earshot. Tuvia joins
him.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: We cannot feed them.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: I’ll go ask Koscik for food.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: And the pistol.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: And the pistol. Without another word, he
starts off.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Remember to say please.</p>
<p><strong>20 a russian-made mahkarov revolver. 20</strong>: Koscik, a
rotund, florid-faced Pole, hands it to Tuvia.</p>
<p><strong>koscik</strong>: I have only four bullets.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: I cannot thank you enough. They sit in
Koscik’s warmly-lit kitchen. Koscik’s WIFE stands silently by the stove,
glaring at Tuvia.</p>
<p><strong>koscik</strong>: Your father was a good man.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: He said the same of you. Tuvia can’t help but
notice Koscik’s wife giving him the evil eye. Koscik produces a bottle
of vodka.</p>
<p><strong>koscik</strong>: Ignore the bitch. To the dead. God rest
their souls. Bitch– Do you want vodka? His wife just glares at him.</p>
<p><strong>koscik</strong>: I live with this, can you imagine?
HEADLIGHTS sweep over the window. A CAR is fast approaching.</p>
<p><strong>koscik</strong>: Hide yourself. …The barn.</p>
<p><strong>22 in the loft 22</strong>: He climbs a ladder and is
startled to find FIVE MORE MEN AND WOMEN in hiding. They stare in mute
terror.</p>
<p><strong>23 outside the barn 23</strong>: Koscik greets A BELARUSSIAN
POLICE CAPTAIN and his SONS as they exit the car. They speak in Russian,
with subtitles:</p>
<p><strong>koscik</strong>: Working late, boys.</p>
<p><strong>police captain</strong>: Hunting Jews. Our new bosses are
very organized. Koscik offers the bottle.</p>
<p><strong>koscik</strong>: Hunting can work up a thirst.</p>
<p><strong>police captain</strong>: Fifteen in one day. The council is
offering a year’s free tax for every one you turn in. -</p>
<p><strong>koscik</strong>: A Jew is worth that much? Do you pay more
for a fat one? They laugh appreciatively.</p>
<p><strong>24 in the loft 24</strong>: A man COUGHS then shrugs an
apology. Tuvia glares at him.</p>
<p><strong>police captain</strong>: Caught five of them hiding in a
ditch. Smelled so bad I was afraid the Germans wouldn’t want them.</p>
<p><strong>koscik</strong>: Maybe for a reduced price. More laughter.
More vodka.</p>
<p><strong>police captain</strong>: You know the Bielski’s?</p>
<p><strong>koscik</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>police captain</strong>: We missed two when we visited the
parents.</p>
<p><strong>26 in the loft 26</strong>: Tuvia listens to this casual talk
of his parent’s death.</p>
<p><strong>police captain</strong>: Anybody caught helping them is in
for it. You know this, Koscik?</p>
<p><strong>koscik</strong>: Do I look like an idiot? Don’t answer so
quickly… More laughter. The Police Captain looks at his watch.
Yawns.</p>
<p><strong>police captain</strong>: Been at it since dawn. The wife
doesn’t like these long nights. He tries to hand back the bottle to
Koscik.</p>
<p><strong>koscik</strong>: Keep it.</p>
<p><strong>police captain</strong>: Bribing an officer of the law? Maybe
you have more of this black market vodka hidden in the barn?</p>
<p><strong>koscik</strong>: Take a look. And clean out the cow shit
while you’re back there. The policeman laughs and climbs back into the
car.</p>
<p><strong>police captain</strong>: You’ll keep your eyes open, yes?</p>
<p><strong>koscik</strong>: Good hunting.</p>
<p><strong>28 moments later - in the barn 28</strong>: Koscik and Tuvia
speak in harsh whispers.</p>
<p><strong>koscik</strong>: –If the laborers find them tomorrow, I will
be denounced–</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: What am I supposed to do with–</p>
<p><strong>koscik</strong>: Take them into the forest–</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: –And feed them how? I can’t care for my own
family. Behind them, several of the REFUGEES have emerged from their
hiding place. They stare at Tuvia balefully.</p>
<p><strong>29 moments later - by the roadside 29</strong>: The refugees
are loaded with provisions. A young man, PINCHAS ZUCKERMAN, has a
tethered GOAT. Another man carries a violin case. Koscik hands Tuvia
another bottle of vodka.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Those men? They were the ones who killed my
parents?</p>
<p><strong>29 continued: 29</strong>: Koscik doesn’t want to tell him.
Finally he nods, yes.</p>
<p><strong>koscik</strong>: You people. Why is it so fucking hard to be
friends with a Jew? They embrace.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Imagine being one. Tuvia leads his motley
band toward the woods.</p>
<p><strong>30 a forest trail - day 30</strong>: Tuvia leads them. He
notices an OLD MAN staring at him.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: You sat in back. Tuvia just looks at
him.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: In school. I am Shimon H’aretz.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: I thought you were dead.</p>
<p><strong>shimon</strong>: I am at least half-dead. I heard them
speaking of your parents. I am very sorry. Tuvia shakes his head.</p>
<p><strong>shimon</strong>: And the other brothers? What was his name,
the wild one?</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Zus. He’s with the other two.</p>
<p><strong>shimon</strong>: You are hiding here? In the forest? Tuvia
nods.</p>
<p><strong>shimon</strong>: There has been trouble before maybe? With
the police? Tuvia doesn’t answer.</p>
<p><strong>shimon</strong>: So now you go to the forest. A wise
choice.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: For a dumb schoolboy, you mean.</p>
<p><strong>shimon</strong>: My whole life I presumed to teach others the
right way to live. I had no doubt: this is God’s way, this isn’t. You’ll
forgive me if recent events have somewhat shaken my resolve.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: It is just like school, I don’t know what
you’re talking about. Teacher…Come… Come.</p>
<p>****: Please.</p>
<p><strong>32 the clearing - later that day 32</strong>: The new
arrivals squat by a fire where potatoes are cooking in the ashes.
Everyone shares from the soup pot. There aren’t enough spoons to go
around. Shimon offers Aron something to eat.</p>
<p><strong>shimon</strong>: Here… You’re not hungry? Aron doesn’t
respond.</p>
<p><strong>shimon</strong>: The little one does not talk?</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: He saw. Things.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia, meanwhile</strong>: stares fixedly as Avram digs his
daughter’s grave. The gun is still in his belt. Zus is constructing a
shelter.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: I send you for food and you bring more mouths
to feed.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: You send me?</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Did you at least get the gun?</p>
<p><strong>32 continued: 32</strong>: Tuvia shows him.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Only four bullets.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Then we’ll have to make them count. Zus heads
for the food. Asael is trying to start a fire but the kindling is
wet.</p>
<p><strong>shimon</strong>: Here… Shimon takes a book from his coat,
rips out pages covered in Hebrew and crumples them into the fire. They
burst into flame.</p>
<p><strong>shimon</strong>: The Psalms have many uses.</p>
<p><strong>zus sits among the newcomers</strong>: watching as they eat
hungrily. Tuvia stops near Avram DIGGING a grave before heading out of
the camp. We realize Avram’s daughter has died while Tuvia was away. THE
SOUND OF DISTANT THUNDER.</p>
<p><strong>33 a lone farmhouse - dusk 33</strong>: Tuvia stands in the
driving rain, shaking. He stares at the lit windows.</p>
<p><strong>34 inside the house 34</strong>: The POLICE CAPTAIN we saw
earlier eats dinner with his WIFE and TWO SONS. They speak in
Russian.</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: You worked late. The man nods, his mouth full
of food.</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: Tomorrow is Sunday. You have a day off,
yes?</p>
<p><strong>police captain</strong>: …Fucking SS never sleeps… The door
OPENS slowly. They all look up.</p>
<p><strong>34 continued: 34</strong>: Tuvia stands on the threshold,
dripping wet, a spectral figure. He holds the pistol at his side.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: You know who I am? The policeman says
nothing. His wife is instantly terrified. One of the SONS stands. Tuvia
turns the gun on him.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Sit. The son obeys. The SOUND of the rain on
the tin roof is deafening. Tuvia turns back to the Police Captain.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: And you know why I am here.</p>
<p><strong>police captain</strong>: …what are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: You have no idea what I’m talking about…</p>
<p><strong>police captain</strong>: If they say find someone, I find
him. It’s my job.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: To find Jews.</p>
<p><strong>police captain</strong>: Or lose my job.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: And it’s a good job, isn’t it? You like your
job.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: I was always fair with your family.
…Everyone knew you were smuggling this and that. But I looked the other
way. …Ask your father.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: My father? You don’t talk about my father…
Tuvia places the pistol against the man’s forehead.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Down on your knees.</p>
<p><strong>on…your…knees…pig!</strong>: The policeman begins to
weep.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: For my parents, David and Beila Bielski… for
my brothers and all the others–</p>
<p><strong>police captain</strong>: Please…. I beg you… One of the man’s
SONS makes a move toward Tuvia. Tuvia SHOOTS him in the chest. His
mother SCREAMS. The Policeman suddenly starts to stand. Tuvia backs
away, shoots him. And then the other son. It is all over in seconds.</p>
<p><strong>36 tuvia stands there, frozen 36</strong>: The police
captain’s wife is prostrate and KEENING over her dead family in
Russian.</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: Kill me, too! Tuvia should indeed kill her,
too. To avoid being identified.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Tell them who did this.</p>
<p><strong>37 a forest trail - still raining 37</strong>: Tuvia pushes
through dense forest. Branches rake his face. Finally he leans against a
tree. We move CLOSE on his face.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Riboynoy shel oylam, riboynoy shel oylam…
Lord of the universe, forgive me, I have murdered – but they were
monsters and did not deserve to live.</p>
<p><strong>38 next morning - a low fog clings to the forest floor
38</strong>: Zus awakens, sodden and stiff. He looks at the group, now
numbering fourteen. People sleep huddled together: Asael holds Aron;
Avram keeps his surviving daughter close. And there is Tuvia – sitting
by the fire. Zus takes the pistol from Tuvia’s belt. Checks the
cylinder.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Only one bullet left.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: His sons. Zus nods his approval.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: How was it?</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: To kill them. It was good, no?</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Shut up. Tuvia stares into the fire. He is
dirty and tired. Zus looks around.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: What are we going to do with these others?</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: I don’t know–</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: The women will slow us down. And your old
teacher–</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: You’re afraid he’s going to beat you for
forgetting your homework.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: We have to be able to keep moving, and
quickly.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: I agree. But they’re here. They consider
their predicament.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: We’ll sleep farther up the trail. If anyone
comes, they’ll find them first. The gunshots will give us time to
escape.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Alright. But no more.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: No more.</p>
<p><strong>39 several more refugees 39</strong>: stumbling into camp
behind Tuvia, who carries a heavy sack of provisions. Zus gives Tuvia a
look.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: I know. I know… Tamara, you remember Cousin
Zus. Please, go sit down by the fire. And this is Lazar – Isabel’s
youngest… Tamara is pleasant-looking but emotionally wounded.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: This is Isaac Malbin. From Minsk. Malbin is
sweet-faced with little round Trotsky glasses.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Asael, find them something to eat.</p>
<p><strong>asael!</strong>: Zus takes Tuvia aside.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Tuvia, I have pity for them all,</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: They are family.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: And how will we feed this family?</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: We’ll water the soup. One of the new arrivals
is a DARK-HAIRED BEAUTY. Tuvia and Zus watch her pass. Zus is
particularly interested.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: And this one, is she family?</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: No. By the fire, the veterans pepper the
newcomers with</p>
<p><strong>39 continued: 39</strong>: questions.</p>
<p><strong>miriam</strong>: You are from Lida! Is Isadore Korein
alive?</p>
<p><strong>lova</strong>: There are so many in the ghetto, I don’t
know…</p>
<p><strong>tamara</strong>: Does anyone have news from Vilna?</p>
<p><strong>40a another day 40a</strong>: Food, such as it is, is being
handed out to SEVERAL NEW ARRIVALS. Asael brushes Aron’s hair. Rachel
sits beside her grieving father. She looks at Aron. He looks back.
Nearby, Tuvia and Malbin are building a shelter. Malbin is hopelessly
inept. A wall COLLAPSES.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Fuck me! Have you never used a hammer?</p>
<p><strong>malbin</strong>: Uh. No.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: What is it you do, then?</p>
<p><strong>malbin</strong>: I suppose…you’d have to say…I was…am…an
intellectual.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: This is a job?</p>
<p><strong>malbin</strong>: I published a small magazine… actually a
journal…well, more like a pamphlet. Zus passes them, his arm around the
dark-haired beauty.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Tuvia, this is Rona. Rona is my forest
wife.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: I see. Congratulations. Zus winks and walks
past. Malbin and Tuvia watch them.</p>
<p><strong>malbin</strong>: Interesting concept.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: As long as his village wife stays in
hiding.</p>
<p><strong>malbin</strong>: Nice to know there are some things even
Hitler can’t destroy.</p>
<p><strong>40a continued: 40a</strong>: Suddenly the camp grows quiet.
TWO YOUNG MEN who have emerged from the forest, their clothes dirty and
torn. One of them aims an army-issue rifle.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Hello, boys, what can we do for you?</p>
<p><strong>young man #1</strong>: Food. We want food. Everyone remains
still. Zus eyes his own rifle nearby.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: These little shits are holding us up. The Young
Man motions his partner to take Zus’s rifle.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: You little shits have the balls to shoot me? In
response, the young man CHAMBERS A ROUND.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: This is all the food we have. You are welcome
to share.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: I want to see if this little shit will shoot
me. You like shooting Jews, you little shit?</p>
<p><strong>young man #1</strong>: You are Jews?</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: No. We’re the Gestapo, you little shit.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Come. Sit. Put down your guns.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Or perhaps you’d prefer I shove them up your
ass.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Where are you from? The young man glares at
Zus. Then, to Tuvia:</p>
<p><strong>young man #1</strong>: Horodyszcze. The name freezes Zus in
his tracks. His wife is there.</p>
<p><strong>peretz</strong>: We haven’t eaten in two days. My name is
Peretz, this is Jacov.</p>
<p><strong>jacov</strong>: Two days ago there were three thousand Jews
in Horodyszcze. Now there are fifty. Me and him, we hid in a wall.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: You know a woman there, Sonia Bielski? The men
look at one another.</p>
<p><strong>jacov</strong>: We knew her. Zus can hardly bring himself to
ask the next question.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: …There was a child. Jacov shakes his head.
Sorry. Zus leans his head against a tree. After a moment he begins to
BEAT HIS HEAD against it until BLOOD pours down his face.</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: His family. Tuvia puts his arms around his
brother. Zus’s shoulders begin to heave. Soon his body convulses with
deep wracking sobs. He is absolutely unself-conscious in his grief.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: So many dead.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Mama. Papa. Their heads are close together,
their faces wet with tears.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Why not us?</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: I thought they’d be safe. I should have been
with them.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: I could have protected them. Tuvia just holds
him. He, too, is crying quietly.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Better to be rabbits? Hunted? Hiding? No… Zus
breaks free of Tuvia’s embrace and walks away.</p>
<p><strong>41 later - by the fire 41</strong>: Jacov and Peretz are
eating. Between ravenous bites–</p>
<p><strong>peretz</strong>: We are looking for partisans.</p>
<p><strong>jacov</strong>: What is the name of your otriad? Tuvia laughs
ruefully.</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: What is an ‘otriad?’</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: An armed brigade.</p>
<p><strong>jacov</strong>: We heard the Russians are beginning to
organize.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Here?</p>
<p><strong>jacov</strong>: And also in the Lipicanska.</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: Then we are the Bielski Otriad. You want to
join?</p>
<p><strong>peretz</strong>: The Russians are fighters.</p>
<p><strong>jacov</strong>: –But you need a gun to join them. Without a
gun you are nothing. They sabotage railroads and kill Germans.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: We will kill all the Germans you can handle.
Starting tonight. They stare up at him, his face a mask of blood and
filth.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: If you’re not afraid to use that rifle.</p>
<p><strong>42 moments later - just outside of camp – 42</strong>: Zus is
loading Wilencki’s gun.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: –we must get what we need without killing. We
can’t make more enemies– Zus concentrates on opening the breach.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: –It won’t bring your family back to life. Or
Mama. Or Papa.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Blood for blood. You had your revenge.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: And I can still see their faces.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: ‘Vengeance is mine.’ Who said that?</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: So this is God’s work you’re doing,
Zussie?</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: No. Only YOU can play God. Save a few lives,
take a few others…</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: We cannot become…like them.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: If only… Are you coming with us or not?</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Us?</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Peretz and Jacov.</p>
<p>****: Asael, too. Tuvia looks over at Asael, who looks away.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: You are making the decisions now? A
stand-off. Zus stares back at him. The struggle for command has grown
more obvious.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: We wait for dark.</p>
<p><strong>43 a burning truck 43</strong>: Lights up the night sky. A
MAN comes running out of a tavern, the same man who loaded Jews onto
trucks in an earlier scene.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: My truck! WHO DID THIS TO MY TRUCK? Tuvia, Zus
and the others appear out the shadows.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: We did.</p>
<p><strong>43 continued: 43</strong>: The man stops short at the sight
of their weapons.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p>****: You don’t understand. They made me give them my truck… Zus
FIRES. Jacov and Peretz follow suit. The man goes down. They throw his
DEAD BODY onto the burning truck.</p>
<p><strong>43a a cluster of houses - later that night 43a</strong>: Zus
and Peretz are backing out of an open doorway, FIRING BACK INSIDE AS
THEY GO. From within, the sound of SCREAMS.</p>
<p><strong>cooperate with nazi scum..!</strong>: FACES appear furtively
at the windows of nearby houses. Zus addresses the little neighborhood,
delirious with joy.</p>
<p><strong>tell them!</strong>: Tuvia looks around warily. This is
getting out of hand.</p>
<p><strong>44 a roadside ditch - later that night 44</strong>: Tuvia and
Asael lie in on one side of a road. Tuvia has looped ONE END OF THE WIRE
around a post.</p>
<p><strong>45 in the ditch on the other side 45</strong>: Zus, Peretz,
and Jacov WRAP THE WIRE to a tree.</p>
<p><strong>46 up ahead 46</strong>: The lights of a MOTORCYCLE, a GERMAN
COURIER.</p>
<p><strong>47 in the ditch 47</strong>: Tuvia waits until the BIKE is
almost upon them. Then he TIGHTENS the WIRE so it stretches INVISIBLY
ACROSS THE ROAD.</p>
<p><strong>48 the motorcyclist is garroted 48</strong>: by the wire. His
bike goes sliding away as the Bielski’s swarm him, KILLING HIM with the
last bullet from the Mahkarov. ZUS rummages through the downed-bike’s
saddlebags. He finds a beautiful KNIFE and lifts it up triumphantly.</p>
<p><strong>peretz</strong>: Look–! MORE HEADLIGHTS fast approaching.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Hide! Everyone! They all scramble back into
the ditch, dragging the dead courier with them.</p>
<p><strong>49 a german staff car 49</strong>: approaches. As its
headlights pick up the downed motorcycle, it slows and pulls off to the
side –</p>
<p><strong>50 directly over the ditch 50</strong>: Where Tuvia and Zus
are concealed. From within the car, we hear VOICES SPEAKING GERMAN. A
YOUNG PRIVATE gets out and walks up the road to investigate.</p>
<p><strong>private</strong>: It’s one of ours, but no one is here. Maybe
he was drunk? From the car, an SERGEANT yells a reply.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Move it off the road before the convoy
passes. I’ll report the sonuvabitch. As the soldier drags the bike off
the road, AN OFFICER steps out of the car and lights a cigarette. He’s
followed by the Sergeant. He carries a Schmeisser SUBMACHINE GUN
dangling from his shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>51 in the ditch - zus 51</strong>: can see the Sergeant’s
feet peeking out over the ditch.</p>
<p><strong>a stream of piss</strong>: Cascades onto him. He tries to
inch his body away…</p>
<p><strong>the pissing sergeant</strong>: catches the flicker of
MOVEMENT below, SEES Zus lying in the ditch. Stunned, he tries to zip up
his fly. It catches. ZUS LEAPS UP brandishing the KNIFE. He’s on the
Sergeant before he can get the gun off his shoulder. Stabbing him
through his greatcoat, the BLADE BREAKS OFF IN HIS HAND. MEANWHILE, THE
LIEUTENANT drops his cigarette, reaching under his coat for a pistol.
Tuvia TACKLES him. The GUN skids away. They roll around on the road,
CLAWING, PUNCHING, BITING. Tuvia SLAMS the man’s head against the
pavement.</p>
<p><strong>52 up the road 52</strong>: The Private sees Asael and Peretz
coming at him. Jacov follows with his rifle. The Private turns and runs
down the road. They give chase.</p>
<p><strong>53 from inside the car 53</strong>: Another OFFICER is in the
back seat with A WOMAN. He reaches for his gun, stands up in the seat
and begins FIRING WILDLY at Tuvia. TUVIA ROLLS UNDER THE CAR, avoiding
the burst. MEANWHILE, ZUS USES THE HANDLE OF THE KNIFE to BREAK the
Sergeant’s nose. He RIPS the SCHMEISSER away, firing point- blank into
the man, whose greatcoat CATCHES FIRE.</p>
<p><strong>inside the staff car</strong>: The officer takes close aim at
Tuvia, just as ZUS TURNS THE MACHINE GUN on the car BLOWING OUT THE
WINDOWS, killing the Officer and the woman – and saving his brother’s
life.</p>
<p><strong>54 meanwhile, down the road 54</strong>: Jacov fires at the
Private, MISSES. The man keeps RUNNING. Jacov fires again. MISSES AGAIN.
FINALLY his THIRD SHOT hits him in the leg. The Private keeps running.
Limping now.</p>
<p><strong>jacov</strong>: I got him! Peretz and Asael can now catch up
to the soldier.</p>
<p><strong>from far away</strong>: We SEE them knock the Private to the
ground, KICKING him until Jacov catches up to them and FIRES A FINAL
SHOT.</p>
<p><strong>55 back at the staff car 55</strong>: Tuvia stands, out of
breath.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Stupid! The gunfire could be heard for
miles.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: He was pissing on my head. Zus is high from the
killing, covered in the dead man’s blood. He begins calling out
orders.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Peretz, Jacov, check the car for guns… This
one’s yours. He presents him with the Schmeisser as if it were a trophy.
Tuvia accepts it, checking the gun efficiently.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: I’ll check his pockets for more ammo.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Hurry–!</p>
<p><strong>at the staff car</strong>: Peretz and Jacov emerge with two
MACHINE-PISTOLS, several BOTTLES OF SCHNAPPS and a beautiful LEICA
CAMERA.</p>
<p><strong>jacov</strong>: They were on their way to a party! They toss
one bottle to Zus and another to Tuvia.</p>
<p><strong>56 up the road 56</strong>: Asael stands over the dead
Private. He isn’t much older than Aron.</p>
<p><strong>57 back at the staff car 57</strong>: ZUS rifles the pockets
of the dead Sergeant for ammo. He finds cigarettes and the man’s wallet.
He opens it.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Welcome to Belarus, herr Henkel. A CHAMPAGNE
CORK POPS as Peretz and Jacov toast their victory.</p>
<p><strong>peretz</strong>: Now we are real Partisans…</p>
<p><strong>jacov</strong>: To the Bielski Otriad!</p>
<p><strong>58 suddenly - another set of headlights 58</strong>: are
rounding the bend. Troop trucks. The Staff Car was leading A CONVOY.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Into the fields! RUN! Tuvia pulls Peretz off
the road, but Jacov reloads his rifle and begins to FIRE at the
approaching trucks.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Jacov, NO! THE TRUCKS STOP. Troops pour off
and begin RETURNING FIRE. Jacov is CUT DOWN by a MACHINE GUN. Peretz,
Zus, and Tuvia race into the WHEAT FIELD. It’s not clear if they can
make it into the woods. A FLARE IGNITES OVERHEAD turning the wheat
fields BRIGHT WHITE in flickering incandescence. Malbin is almost
paralytic with fear. ASAEL doesn’t know which way to run. He plunges
into the WHEAT FIELD…but ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE ROAD. ONE OF THE
TRUCKS drives forward, CUTTING HIM OFF, using its SPOTLIGHT to reveal
him. FIFTEEN SOLDIERS start after him.</p>
<p><strong>59 seen from above 59</strong>: We watch as they CONVERGE on
him.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia, zus and peretz</strong>: Have almost made it into the
woods when PERETZ IS HIT. He falls. Tuvia and Zus pick him up and
half-carry, half-drag him into the sanctuary of the forest.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Zus. His rifle. Zus races back to pick up
Peretz’s weapon.</p>
<p><strong>60 asael, meanwhile 60</strong>: has realized his mistake. He
tries to circle back toward the woods but the SOLDIERS move to CUT HIM
OFF. He is fast, but not fast enough. We realize he isn’t going to make
it.</p>
<p><strong>61 in the woods 61</strong>: Tuvia and Zus look at the scene
with mounting horror.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Asael… He rips the rifle from Zus’s hands.
For a moment we think he’s going to go back after him. Instead, he
wedges the rifle into a tree-trunk and takes careful aim…</p>
<p><strong>the spotlight shatters</strong>: Plunging the field into
darkness as the flare burns out. ASAEL seizes the moment and dives to
his knees, disappearing from view and CRAWLING NOW rather than expose
himself. AN IRRIGATION DITCH is nearby. Frantically he DIGS into the
soft mud on its banks. As he scrapes his hands raw, he can HEAR his
pursuers drawing near, CALLING OUT to one another.</p>
<p><strong>62 the forest camp - dawn 62</strong>: A somber mood. Tuvia
watches someone scrape at the porridge congealed in an empty pot. OTHERS
stare listlessly into space. ONE MAN chews on a piece of leather,
ANOTHER sucks on an old chicken bone. Zus, meanwhile, is in the middle
of a nasty drunk from the captured schnapps. Nearby, Aron shares his
ration of bread with Rachel. Little enough, but a connection is made.
Peretz lies nearby. Malbin is trying to comforts him. There is nothing
that can help him. Malbin looks to Tuvia.</p>
<p><strong>shimon</strong>: They thought you were bringing food. Tuvia
just stares at him.</p>
<p><strong>shimon</strong>: Did the farmers stop you? Still no answer
from Tuvia.</p>
<p><strong>shimon</strong>: They had guns? Dogs?</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>shimon</strong>: I don’t understand. Tuvia says nothing.
Nearby, a child cries in hunger.</p>
<p><strong>shimon</strong>: The Talmud says if you save a life you must
take responsibility for it.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Again I have no idea what you are talking
about. Around them, the beseeching eyes of so many hungry faces.</p>
<p><strong>shimon</strong>: I think you do.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You are the Bielski’s? A MAN stands in the
clearing. BEN ZION GULKOWITZ is tall, well muscled, a rifle strapped
over his shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: How’d you get past the Lazar?</p>
<p><strong>ben zion</strong>: Who? Zus stands unsteadily, then lurches
into the woods, leaning on an occasional tree for support. He finds the
erstwhile sentry –LAZAR – ambling toward him.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: You shit! You worthless shit! Zus punches him,
knocking him the ground. In a sloppy, drunken frenzy, Zus SLAPS him
again.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Enough!</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: He walked right by you! Someone could have been
killed! Tuvia pulls Zus off him.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: I said, enough! Get up! Get up!</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: If we were real partisans he’d be shot.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: He made a mistake!</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: MISTAKE! We cannot make mistakes! As Zus goes
for Lazar again, Tuvia roughly PULLS HIM OFF. Zus goes flying, tripping
over, landing on his ass.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: That’s right, Zus. No mistakes. Like last
night. First they will torture Asael…and then they will hang him. Tuvia
walks away, leaving his brother on the ground.</p>
<p><strong>63 back in camp 63</strong>: Tuvia rejoins them. Ben Zion
looks up at him.</p>
<p><strong>ben zion</strong>: You are Tuvia Bielski.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: You know me?</p>
<p><strong>ben zion</strong>: I am Ben Zion Gulkowitz. Ben Zion is
besieged by questions about friends and family.</p>
<p><strong>miriam</strong>: Pardon me, you are from Vilna. My sister
lives on Passaya Street.</p>
<p><strong>ben zion</strong>: The SD came without warning. Hundreds were
taken. No one knows where.</p>
<p><strong>63 continued: 63</strong>: THE WOMAN begins to cry.</p>
<p><strong>miriam</strong>: My poor sister…dear God, no… Meanwhile,
Peretz’s MOANING ceases. A woman grumbles:</p>
<p><strong>woman #1</strong>: We’d be better off in the ghetto…</p>
<p><strong>tamara</strong>: At least here we are safe.</p>
<p><strong>lova</strong>: There at least we had hope…</p>
<p><strong>shimon</strong>: No. Here, we have hope. A FEW MORE join in,
grumbling their dissatisfaction. Others take the opposite position.
These are Jews, after all, and arguing is a revered sport and a pastime.
It escalates.</p>
<p><strong>woman #1</strong>: We are hungry! This is a defining moment
for Tuvia. When at first he speaks, it is awkward, ineffectual amid the
growing tumult.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: I know we have no food. But tomorrow…
tomorrow will be another mission.</p>
<p><strong>rona</strong>: Look what happened the last time.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: That was a mistake! But the mistakes we made
will not be made again! More objections. Tuvia must raise his voice to
be heard.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: We could be here a long time. And we have to
prepare.</p>
<p><strong>lova</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Better security. Better at getting food and
information–</p>
<p>****: –at making shelters. Whatever is needed. We all participate. We
don’t work against each other. At this he looks directly at Zus. Daring
him to object.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: I want to kill Nazis, too, but we…just…cannot
afford revenge. Not right now. We cannot afford to lose friends like
Jacov and Peretz. A small voice speaks up.</p>
<p><strong>aron</strong>: Or Asael. Everyone stares. It is the first
time Aron has spoken.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Or Asael. We… We–</p>
<p>****: –cannot lose anyone. He looks from face to face. Filthy,
ravaged, many of them with tears in their eyes. This is what they need –
leadership, faith, something to believe in. And gradually, his
tentativeness and awkwardness is replaced by something else. A new
voice. From deep inside.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: …We will map out where we’ve been so as to
not visit the same farms too often. And we take only from those who can
afford to give, and leave those who can’t alone.</p>
<p><strong>lova</strong>: The poorest farmer has more than us.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: True. But what I am saying is… what I mean
is… We are not thieves. Or murderers. We may be hunted like animals but
we will not become animals. We have all chosen this – to live free, like
human beings, for as long as we can. Each day of freedom is an act of
faith. And if we die trying to live, at least we die like human beings.
His mission statement. A vision of their future. Everyone nods in mute
acknowledgement. Zus lowers his head. The shift in power between them
has occurred. Tuvia has emerged as the undisputed leader.</p>
<p><strong>64a fall in the forest 64a</strong>: The trees take on color
as if in celebration of their coming together.</p>
<p><strong>65 koscik’s farm 65</strong>: All is quiet as Tuvia, Zus and
Ben Zion watch from the woods.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Now. They leave their cover and approach
warily, guns at the ready.</p>
<p><strong>66 outside the house 66</strong>: Koscik’s wife looks up from
her garden and glares at them.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Hello. She refuses to be flattered. In
Russian:</p>
<p><strong>koscik’s wife</strong>: In the barn.</p>
<p><strong>67 in the barn 67</strong>: Zus calls out.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Koscik, put your pants back on and leave those
sheep alone. He steps into the shadows to find:</p>
<p><strong>koscik hanging from a threshing hook</strong>: that has been
driven through his chest. A sign attached to the hook reads “JEW
LOVER.”</p>
<p><strong>68 koscik’s newly-dug grave 68</strong>: is just beyond the
barn. Tuvia finishes piling on the last shovelful of earth. Koscik’s
wife stares straight ahead.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>koscik’s wife</strong>: Come.</p>
<p><strong>69 a root cellar 69</strong>: dug into a hillside. Overgrown
with tall grass it is undetectable. Koscik’s wife opens the heavy door,
revealing ASAEL, who emerges blinking into the bright light.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Thank God.</p>
<p><strong>69 continued: 69</strong>: Zus pulls his lost brother into a
mighty embrace.</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: Zus…. ZUSSIE… I can’t breathe. Zus lets him
go and Asael reaches back into the root cellar.</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: Look. Two LOVELY YOUNG WOMEN – BELLA and
CHAYA – emerge, tentative and scared. Though their dresses are dirty, it
is obvious they were once expensive. Zus eyes them appreciatively.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Asael… Well, well..</p>
<p>****: Shut up. Look at this– He has two more rifles and a large box
of ammunition. Tuvia turns to Koscik’s wife, deeply moved.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>koscik’s wife</strong>: Go.</p>
<p><strong>70 a forest trail 70</strong>: They head for home. Zus walks
beside Bella.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: –and then we fell into this horrible bog.
Chaya saved me. Honestly, I can’t swim at all.</p>
<p>****: Then I will teach you!</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: We must have got lost a dozen times. I was
absolutely resigned to die.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Tell him, Chaya. Was it not the absolute
worst? And that farmer, Mr. Koscik, kept making the most vulgar jokes,
he said any girl who– As they continue out of earshot, it appears as
though Zus would be happy to listen for hours.</p>
<p><strong>71 a towering pine forest 71</strong>: Aron and Rachel are
walking through the woods. For a brief moment, viewed through the eyes
of the young, we see these woods as a magical place. Strange mushrooms,
gnarled roots, an enormous spider’s web glistening with dew.</p>
<p><strong>72 the camp has begun to show progress 72</strong>: Sentries
are posted. Zus expertly helps with the building a bunker . There’s a
more permanent kitchen, a wash trough, a clothesline. Pinchas tends his
goat. Though primitive and raw…a haven.</p>
<p><strong>shimon and malbin are digging a hole</strong>: Their
bickering will become for them, as time goes on, a sport and a
pastime.</p>
<p><strong>malbin</strong>: You’re trying to tell me all politics is
meaningless.</p>
<p><strong>shimon</strong>: In the West a monster with a little
mustache, in the East a monster with a big mustache. This is all I need
to know about politics.</p>
<p><strong>malbin</strong>: Your messiah will have a mustache, too, and
a full beard.</p>
<p><strong>shimon</strong>: No. The messiahs are all in politics, and
they’re killing us. Zus unloads two cut and stripped trees.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: What’s killing me is all your talking. Back to
work. Malbin and Shimon go back to work.</p>
<p><strong>malbin</strong>: And Roosevelt? He has no mustache.</p>
<p><strong>shimon</strong>: My life in these woods is much easier
because of Mr. Roosevelt, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>73 walking through the camp tuvia and asael 73</strong>:
review their plans.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: We need to know what’s going on in the
villages, how the Germans patrol, who the informers are– He realizes
that Asael is not fully concentrating; instead he is watching as Chaya
walks past.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Are you listening to me?</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: What’s her name?</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: Chaya.</p>
<p><strong>chaya!</strong>: He waves as Chaya turns to look in their
direction. Asael smiles, embarrassed.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: So talk to her.</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: I hardly know her.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: You spent three days in a cellar! Asael
blushes, returns the focus to their prior conversation.</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: Malbin says the Piznarksi granary is full. We
need two guns at least…</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Whose turn to go?</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: Zus.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: You go along, just to make sure he
understands my orders. Asael nods.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Go on…Go!</p>
<p><strong>73 continued: 73</strong>: Asael heads toward Chaya.</p>
<p><strong>74 near a shed roof - ben zion 74</strong>: We notice a FEW
NEW FACES. Their number has exceeded twenty. Among them are two
lumbering, dark-skinned men, ARKADY and MOTL LUBCZANSKI. Ben Zion is
showing Lazar and the other newcomers how to clean a weapon.</p>
<p><strong>ben zion</strong>: This is not a gun. It is Bar Kochba’s
spear. It is Ehud’s sword. You fix the patch to the rod– They do as he
instructs.</p>
<p><strong>ben zion</strong>: –then run it through the barrel… and don’t
lose the patch in the</p>
<p><strong>barrel–</strong>: Lazar looks up, sheepishly.</p>
<p><strong>lazar</strong>: I lost my patch. ARKADY LUBCZANSKI whispers
contemptuously to his brother,</p>
<p><strong>arkady lubczanski</strong>: The village idiot. Zus shoves
Arkady out of the way and approaches Lazar, who cowers. But rather than
abuse him, Zus removes the patch from the rifle and hands it back to
him.</p>
<p><strong>lazar</strong>: Thank you, Zus.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: It’s nothing.</p>
<p><strong>76 a roadside - next day 76</strong>: KISSELY is a MILKMAN
with bright red hair and a bushy mustache. He leads a horse-drawn CART
laden with milk cans. ZUS AND THE OTHERS rise up out of the ditch. In
Russian:</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Good morning, friend. Getting an early start to
market? Could you possibly spare us a bit of milk? Zus’ tone is belied
by the rifle in his hand.</p>
<p><strong>kissely</strong>: This is what I’m required to give the
Germans. If I don’t meet my quota they’ll shoot me and my family. Zus is
tempted to shoot him himself.</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: Leave half. He can’t go to the Germans
empty-handed. Zus glares at Asael.</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: Tuvia’s orders. Zus shakes his head, climbs
onto the wagon and begins removing cartons.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: We are so grateful, comrade, for your
cooperation. What a lovely coat. Is that a fur collar?</p>
<p><strong>77 zus, now wearing the milkman’s coat 77</strong>: joins the
others lugging milk cans along the forest path.</p>
<p><strong>halt! who goes there!</strong>: Zus shakes his head. Lazar
stands, pointing his weapon.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Lazar, you can see it’s us, you idiot. You only
ask, ‘who goes there’ when you don’t know who it is.</p>
<p><strong>lazar</strong>: Sorry, Zus.</p>
<p><strong>78 the camp 78</strong>: is a beehive of activity. Shimon and
Malbin are digging.</p>
<p><strong>malbin</strong>: Even Spinoza said existence can be
substantiated by empirical evidence.</p>
<p><strong>shimon</strong>: All your secular learning, yet you know
nothing of life.</p>
<p><strong>malbin</strong>: How can you say this? Learning is my
life.</p>
<p><strong>shimon</strong>: And for every fact that goes in your head,
another comes out your rear end. CHAYA and BELLA receive the bounty from
the foragers.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Milk, eggs – Chaya, our brave men have
brought us a feast!</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Blintzes! You will make me blintzes! She
bestows her best smile upon him.</p>
<p><strong>79 by the fire 79</strong>: New arrivals are being shown
around by Ben Zion.</p>
<p><strong>79 continued: 79</strong>: A MAN and WOMAN cry out with joy
at an unexpected reunion.</p>
<p><strong>79 continued: 79</strong>: ARKADY LUBCZANSKi approaches
Chaya.</p>
<p><strong>arkady</strong>: I don’t think we’ve been properly
introduced. Arkady Lubczanski.</p>
<p><strong>chaya</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>arkady</strong>: You are Chaya?</p>
<p><strong>chaya</strong>: …Yes.</p>
<p><strong>arkady</strong>: You are getting along all right? Anything
you need? An extra blanket?</p>
<p><strong>chaya</strong>: Oh. Well… Yes, that would be nice.</p>
<p><strong>arkady</strong>: You’ll have it by tonight. Something nice
and soft. I couldn’t help but notice you don’t have a husband yet.</p>
<p><strong>chaya</strong>: Yet?</p>
<p><strong>arkady</strong>: Most of the woman have already chosen. They
haven’t told you about this?</p>
<p><strong>chaya</strong>: No. But thank you for explaining it. She
hurries away. Malbin sits down wearily beside Shimon.</p>
<p><strong>malbin</strong>: Descartes at least provided for the
subjective nature of experience. He takes a spoon from his sock.</p>
<p><strong>shimon</strong>: Yes. You annoy me therefore I exist.</p>
<p><strong>malbin</strong>: You are not eating?</p>
<p><strong>shimon</strong>: By my best calculation, today is High
Holiday. I am fasting. Malbin can’t believe this. He rolls his eyes and
digs in. One of the NEWCOMERS has brought a violin. He begins to play. A
bittersweet melody. People stop talking and listen, eyes filling at this
reminder of a sweeter, civilized time. Ben Zion has left the new
arrivals and approached Tuvia. He looks grave. Tuvia immediately knows
something is wrong.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>ben zion</strong>: The new ones, they are from Novagroduk.
Your wife– Tuvia tenses. Ben Zion hesitates…</p>
<p><strong>ben zion</strong>: They say…She was killed last week. I’m
sorry. Tuvia nods. No outward display of grief. An awkward moment.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Thank you for telling me. We have to dig a
trench around the new zemylanka. If it rains I’m afraid water will seep
in. Tuvia clearly cannot deal with his news.</p>
<p><strong>ben zion</strong>: I’ll see to it, then.</p>
<p><strong>79 continued: 79</strong>: Tuvia nods and walks away.</p>
<p><strong>80 aron and rachel walk through the woods - continuous
80</strong>: Cathedral light cuts through the trees forming visible
shafts.</p>
<p><strong>aron</strong>: Jacob’s ladders. Like in his dream. Asael says
you can see the angels. They walk on, eventually coming upon RAILROAD
TRACKS. A TRAIN is rounding the bend, headed in their direction.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Can we stay to watch?</p>
<p><strong>aron</strong>: If we hide. They move back into the trees as
the train NEARS: a slow- moving engine pulling a line of WOODEN CATTLE
CARS.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Is that a Nazi train?</p>
<p><strong>aron</strong>: If we had some dynamite we could blow the shit
out of it.</p>
<p>****: …Just like your brothers. Aron can’t help but be pleased by
this notion. Then, as the train passes, they can see HANDS gripping the
small barred windows. And every now and then a gaunt, desperate FACE.
They stare in astonishment.</p>
<p><strong>81a under a shelter – continuous 81a</strong>: Tuvia sits
alone. Outside, the SOUND of the violin continues. Shimon comes to sit
beside him.</p>
<p><strong>shimon</strong>: I am sorry for your loss. Tuvia nods. He is
deep inside himself.</p>
<p><strong>shimon</strong>: Do you want to say the Kaddish? When at last
Tuvia speaks, it is almost to himself.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: She was a beautiful woman. But cold. Not a
day went by she didn’t remind me I wasn’t a good provider. For years it
wasn’t really a marriage at all. And now… He lowers his head. All Shimon
can do is sit beside him.</p>
<p><strong>82 the perimeter of the camp - continuous 82</strong>: Bella
takes Chaya aside.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: You have lipstick? Please, I know you have
some left. Chaya digs in her pocket and produces a tiny remnant. Bella
dabs it on and casually approaches Zus, who is on guard duty.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: May I join you?</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: You get lonely out here?</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: I like the woods. LAUGHTER and MUSIC waft
through the trees.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: I’m a little scared out here. Zus knows an
opportunity when he sees one. He offers her a drink from his bottle of
vodka.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: I’ve never tried it.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Go ahead. She drinks, refuses to grimace.
Drinks again. Zus laughs. - Bella touches the rifle in his arms.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Why is there a rule against women having
guns?</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: There aren’t enough for the men.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Women need guns, too.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: For protection.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Women have men for protection. Bella bites her
lip. She’s a virgin but also realistic.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: I want protection. She steps closer and takes
Zus’s hand…under her coat…onto her breast…never taking her eyes off
him.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: You will take good care of me? You will be my
commander.</p>
<p><strong>84 meanwhile - deep in the forest 84</strong>: Aron and
Rachel are walking back from the train tracks. Suddenly he senses
movement, freezes: ARMED POLICEMEN are advancing through the trees. Aron
and Rachel bury themselves beneath piles of leaves until the police pass
by, then he grabs her hand and dashes</p>
<p><strong>off–</strong>: ARON RUNS through the woods like a deer. She
follows.</p>
<p><strong>85 in the camp 85</strong>: He bursts in, SCREAMING.</p>
<p><strong>men with guns!</strong>: Chaos. People panic, search for
family members, grab whatever they can carry, ZUS AND BELLA emerge from
the woods where they have lain together for the first time. He grabs his
rifle. TUVIA tries to maintain order.</p>
<p><strong>only food and guns! follow asael!</strong>: Asael clutches
Chaya’s hand. Rounding up others.</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: Don’t panic. THIS WAY!. GO.</p>
<p><strong>quiet! not another word!!!</strong>: THE POLICEMEN begin
FIRING. TWO of the group are KILLED. Tuvia roughly pushes people deeper
into the woods.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Lova, Ben Zion – stay with us. Asael, keep
them moving. Don’t stop! THE POLICEMEN enter the camp. A submachine gun
RAKES a shelter. KISSELY has found the escape trail into the woods.</p>
<p><strong>kissely</strong>: This way–</p>
<p><strong>86 the forest is deathly still 86</strong>: Tuvia and Zus
usher the group across the river and up the embankment.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Go! Go! Move! Isaac, keep them moving! Zus,
Asael, Ben Zion… Tuvia motions for them to take defensive positions
while the others escape.- The policemen emerge hurriedly through the
trees and begin crossing the river. SHOTS rings out. A Policeman goes
down. The German Soldier is shot in the leg. They are dragged from the
water.</p>
<p><strong>86 continued: 86</strong>: An edgy silence. From the trees a
VOICE calls out in Russian–</p>
<p><strong>the fool?</strong>: The policemen exchange apprehensive
looks.</p>
<p><strong>karelitz!</strong>: The confrontation changes languages.</p>
<p><strong>you first!</strong>: Derisive laughter from the trees.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Give us Bielski and the rest of you can
go free! Behind a tree, Tuvia is surprised by the mention of his
name.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: You are from Belarussia, pig! Why do you work
for the Germans against your own people?</p>
<p><strong>kissely</strong>: For the same reason you steal from the
poor. To survive. ANOTHER SHOT RINGS OUT. Kessely is hit in the arm.</p>
<p><strong>kissely</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Next one is to the head!</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Soon it will be dark… See how you find your
way home then! The policemen are having similar thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>suddenly - a policeman breaks and runs away</strong>: Soon
it’s a full-scale retreat.</p>
<p><strong>after a moment</strong>: Tuvia, Zus, Lova &amp; Ben Zion
emerge. Zus picks up the dead German’s machine pistol.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: They’ll be back. We have to find a new
camp.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Next time just draw them a map.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: It means – we should have killed the fucking
milkman. Your policy of diplomacy is shit. Zus is breathing hard, full
of the adrenaline of battle.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: …Two are dead. Winter is coming and now we have
no shelter. Why? Because you don’t have the stomach to do what must be
done. He walks away.</p>
<p><strong>88 the november wind whistles through the bare forest
88</strong>: as the group trudges along – weighed down by cooking gear,
food, guns, etc. Asael takes the iron cauldron from Chaya. Zus and Bella
walk side-by-side. Pinchas leads his goat.</p>
<p><strong>malbin</strong>: Where is he taking us? My feet are going to
fall off.</p>
<p><strong>shimon</strong>: A great rabbi once said, “wherever I go, I
am always going to the land of Israel.”</p>
<p><strong>malbin</strong>: Well, maybe rabbis should give better
directions. Tuvia walks alongside but apart.</p>
<p><strong>89 a hillside 89</strong>: The group is sprawled on the
ground. Four people share a single cigarette. Shimon and Malbin hardly
have the energy to argue. Pinchas feeds his goat. Tuvia walks among
them.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Rest and eat. I need volunteers for a
scouting party. Zus raises his hand. Tuvia nods in grudging gratitude.
However mixed his feelings, Zus can always be counted on.</p>
<p><strong>90 a fork in the trail 90</strong>: Tuvia looks at Zus, who
shrugs. They are in unfamiliar territory. As they move cautiously
forward:</p>
<p><strong>a man in a red army tunic</strong>: steps into the path,
holding an automatic rifle. He WHISTLES softly. More ARMED MEN
materialize, surrounding them.</p>
<p><strong>who are you?</strong>: Tuvia instantly grasps the situation.
He salutes.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: A brigade of independent fighters searching
for our comrades.</p>
<p><strong>90 continued: 90</strong>: Zus almost does a double-take at
Tuvia’s bluff.</p>
<p><strong>gramov</strong>: What brigade?</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: We belong to the Bielski otriad.</p>
<p><strong>gramov</strong>: We know of you. Jewish bandits. Zus’s finger
tightens on the trigger of his submachine gun.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: I’ll take the two on the left… Tuvia maintains
his composure.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: I’m sure we can clear up this
misunderstanding with your commander.</p>
<p><strong>91 the october otriad base 91</strong>: A primitive tent
camp. RUSSIAN PARTISANS move about, quiet and cold-eyed men wearing
remnants of Red Army uniforms. Zus can’t help but be impressed by the
array of weaponry. VICTOR PACHENKO emerges from a tent. A former
lieutenant, dashing in a fur cap and long officer’s coat. He addresses
them in Russian.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: I am Viktor Panchenko, commander of the
October otriad. We have had complaints of a Jewish gang stealing from
villages loyal to us. How do you respond to these charges?</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: When you take food it is from loyal
supporters. When we do, you call it stealing.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: We are soldiers.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: And we fight a common enemy. The motherland
doesn’t distinguish between Jews and non-Jews. Viktor is amused by this
bit of Soviet dogma.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: But Jews do not fight.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: These Jews do. Viktor appraises Tuvia for a
moment.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: We will see. Select your best fighters and
send them to us. Zus looks at Tuvia, knowing he has no choice.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: We are honored to be of service. Tuvia and
Zus SALUTE and head back the way they came.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: So we’re partisans now.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: As if we have a choice.</p>
<p><strong>91a new camp 91a</strong>: Has taken root. People hard at
work building zemylanka.</p>
<p><strong>92 the new camp 92</strong>: Tuvia and Malbin are working
together on a new bunker. Malbin expertly nails a header across a
doorway.</p>
<p>****: Here.</p>
<p><strong>malbin</strong>: If my friends at The New Socialists’ Club
could see me now… I haven’t read a book in months.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: I haven’t read one in years. Malbin looks up
from his work.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: I wasn’t a very good student. You can ask
Shimon.</p>
<p><strong>malbin</strong>: .I did. Tuvia laughs ruefully. Considers him
for a moment.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Yet you accept me as Commander.</p>
<p><strong>92 continued: 92</strong>: Malbin thinks about it for a
moment.</p>
<p><strong>malbin</strong>: Who else? Tuvia nods. Good point. They
continue working.</p>
<p><strong>malbin</strong>: Might I make an observation? Tuvia gestures,
go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>malbin</strong>: We need to be strong, but–</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: …But–?</p>
<p><strong>malbin</strong>: Other things are important, too.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Such as? Malbin tries to think how best to
put it.</p>
<p><strong>malbin</strong>: Community. Tuvia considers the word. As if
trying it on for size.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: You have more ideas? About all this?</p>
<p><strong>malbin</strong>: …A few.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: I’m listening…</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: More mouths to feed.</p>
<p><strong>rona</strong>: More young bodies to keep us warm. One ot
them, a young man, YITZHAK SHULMAN, RIPS the yellow Star-of-David off
his coat and kneels to KISS THE GROUND.</p>
<p><strong>shulman</strong>: Which one is Tuvia Bielski? Someone points
Tuvia out. Shulman hurries over and kisses Tuvia’s hand. Zus is drinking
nearby with his cronies.</p>
<p><strong>shulman</strong>: None of us knew if you really existed. I am
from Baranowicze. They are going to liquidate the ghetto. Chaya bursts
into tears. Asael puts his arm around her.</p>
<p><strong>chaya</strong>: My parents– Zus catches Tuvia’s glance to
Malbin. Tuvia turns back to Shulman.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: We’ll do what we can.</p>
<p><strong>93 continued: 93</strong>: Shulman tries to kiss Tuvia’s hand
once again, but Tuvia takes his hand, instead, and shakes it. CHAYA
looks deeply into Asael’s eyes.</p>
<p><strong>chaya</strong>: You will help my parents?</p>
<p><strong>chaya</strong>: I’ve seen you looking at me. If you were to
rescue them, I would do… anything…you– Asael is completely undone by the
starkness of this.</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: No. I mean, yes. All right.</p>
<p><strong>94 zus catches up to tuvia 94</strong>: and grabs him as he
walks away. Their hushed tones belie the growing chasm between them.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: And what exactly does that mean, ‘do what we
can.’</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: We must send for whoever is left alive.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: And if it is a hundred? Six hundred?</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Then we will provide.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: And when the Germans follow these hundreds and
slaughter us.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: I won’t let that happen. Tuvia exchanges a
glance with Malbin. Zus catches it. He has sensed Malbin’s growing
influence.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: You won’t let that happen.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: No. I’ll bring them out myself.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: From the ghetto.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Pan Tuvia. Rabbi Tuvia. Allow me to kiss your
hand… Tuvia tries to pull his hand away, but Zus holds him.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: You think Pachenko wants hundreds more of us in
the forest?</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: I cannot have you contradicting me… Not when
others are around. Our family must stick together.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: And who is it that’s risking our family, and
for what? For the sake of these–</p>
<p>****: –Malbushim.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Don’t call them that.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: That’s who comes to us from the ghetto. Empty
clothes. Bloodsuckers.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: They are people. Jews.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Pretentious Jews. Jews who stuck up their noses
and wouldn’t give us the time of day when we passed them on the street.
Jews who went out of their way to keep their daughters locked away from
our dirty hands.</p>
<p>****: You think your old teacher will give you a good grade because
you saved his worthless ass! They accept you as their leader only
because they are too weak and full of shit to help themselves.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: –What about Bella? Tuvia looks over at Bella,
who is anxiously watching.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: –You think she’d be with you if it wasn’t for
what is happening here? Zus glares at him, but tries to control
himself.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: –Is it love Zus?</p>
<p><strong>94 continued: 94</strong>: Zus is sick of talk. He PUNCHES
Tuvia in the face. Tuvia is rocked but still he goads his brother.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: You are the man of her dreams? The Romeo of
Novagrudok? Zus can’t take anymore. He charges Tuvia, who sidesteps and
SLAMS him in the gut. All the frustration of the past months, not to
mention years of sibling rivalry, translates into fists and elbows. Ben
Zion moves to break it up. Tuvia and Zus turn on him.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Is this your business? Zus gains the upper hand
and starts to beat the crap put of Tuvia. Finally, in desperation Tuvia
rolls away and picks up a rock. He is about to slam it into his
brother’s head when suddenly he stops himself. The two brothers look at
each other, both breathing heavily – realizing that they have crossed
some line.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Ben Zion. Krensky. Lova. Israel. Let’s go. We
are going to join the real partisans. He looks at Asael.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Are you coming? Asael looks at one brother,
then the other. Once again, he is in the middle. He looks at Chaya, then
back at Zus.</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Good. I’ll dance at your wedding. He stops by
Bella’s side, touches her arm, then disappears down the trail. The
others follow.</p>
<p><strong>95 the outskirts of novogrudok 95</strong>: Tuvia and Asael
feel naked outside the safety of the forest. In the distance the city
looms.</p>
<p><strong>95a the streets of novogrudok 95a</strong>: Tuvia and Asael
pass by the barbed wire and machine-guns of the guards and dogs manning
the barrier to the ghetto.</p>
<p><strong>96 the walls of the novogrudok ghetto 96</strong>: Tuvia and
Asael climb over a dilapidated wall.</p>
<p><strong>97 the deserted streets of the ghetto 97</strong>: People
peer out from behind shuttered windows. Others hurry to get off the
street. Tuvia consults a hand-drawn map.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: This way.</p>
<p><strong>99 an apartment in the ghetto - day 99</strong>: that might
once have been home to a family-of-four now HOUSES fifteen. Tuvia and
Asael are deep in conversation with several ELDERS of the ghetto
Council</p>
<p><strong>elder #1</strong>: We are not so naive as to believe they
won’t kill some of us. But all the Jews? It makes no sense. They need us
to work. In the factories. The labor camps. Tuvia notices A PRETTY GIRL
standing on a chair in order to hear. Her name is LILKA and we will soon
come to know her.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: There are rumors. Of death camps.</p>
<p><strong>elder #1</strong>: We too have heard of such places. But have
you seen them yourself? Can you tell me, with absolute certainty, that
we are not just as likely to die out there with you in the woods with
Winter coming on…? Someone WHISTLES from the street below. A tense
moment. Another whistle. All clear.</p>
<p><strong>elder #1</strong>: –Do you think we haven’t all considered
running away? For every one that leaves they kill twenty. How can I
sacrifice thousands for the sake of a few?” Tuvia looks at them, rubbing
his face in concentration.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: What if we were to take all of you?</p>
<p><strong>elder #1</strong>: The old, the sick? There are thousands.
How will we live?</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: We will protect you. We have made alliances
with the Russian Partisans.</p>
<p><strong>elder #1</strong>: They are as bad as the Nazi’s. You are too
young to know the pogroms–</p>
<p><strong>99 continued: 99</strong>: Tuvia SLAMS HIS FIST on a
table.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: YOU WANT TIME? Fine, I give you a day. A
month. Maybe a year. To live! Your daughter is out there with us. Your
husband is waiting for you. An old orthodox RABBI stands nearby.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Rabbi?</p>
<p><strong>rabbi</strong>: We…are waiting for God. Tuvia looks at him in
disbelief. Such madness is incontrovertible. A suspended moment.</p>
<p><strong>lilka</strong>: I am going. This breaks the log jam. Several
others join in, “We are coming,” “Us, too,” etc. Tuvia nods his
acknowledgment.</p>
<p><strong>100 a courtyard in the novogrudok ghetto - night
100</strong>: A crude tunnel has been dug through a ghetto wall. PEOPLE
squeeze through into the adjoining alley. Behind them, a hundred more
await their turn. Out in the alley, Asael stops them momentarily as a
car goes by at the end of the street, then gives the all-clear. Tuvia
takes Lilka’ hand and helps her pass through. Their eyes meet for just a
moment.</p>
<p><strong>101 the forest camp 101</strong>: The new ARRIVALS file in.
Men wear citified coats and some women have furs. They eye the veterans,
thinking, ‘how dirty they are’; the veterans eye them warily, wondering,
‘How will we feed them?’ A handmade sign reads, “New Jerusalem.” Chaya
is re-united with her parents. She holds Asael’s arm and looks up at him
with absolute rapture. She is his. Malbin is collecting valuables. One
WELL-DRESSED WOMAN is reluctant to part with her jewelry.</p>
<p><strong>well-dressed woman</strong>: But they were my
grandmother’s…</p>
<p><strong>malbin</strong>: And now they belong to the otriad. Everyone
sacrifices for the sake of the collective. We can trade these for food
or weapons. Next… Nearby, Shimon is INTERVIEWING another line of
arrivals.</p>
<p><strong>shimon</strong>: –How about carpenters? Any bootmakers?
Seamstresses?</p>
<p><strong>arrival #1</strong>: I am an accountant.</p>
<p>****: That should come in handy. Next…</p>
<p><strong>riva</strong>: I am a nurse.</p>
<p><strong>shimon</strong>: Ahhh…welcome. And you, tateh? OPPENHEIM is
an old man with thick glasses.</p>
<p><strong>oppenheim</strong>: I am a watchmaker. Tuvia has walked over
to observe.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Can you repair guns?</p>
<p><strong>oppenheim</strong>: Guns? No.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: See if you can fix this trigger. Oppenheim
slips on a pair of spectacles and studies the mechanism. It sticks. He
digs into his pocket and produces a small file and expertly begins to
shave the metal spur. He tests it, then hands it back to Tuvia, who
CLICKS the trigger.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: You have a new profession. A murmur of
appreciation ripples through the group as Shulman appears – leading A
MAGNIFICENT WHITE HORSE.</p>
<p><strong>shulman</strong>: Look what we found running free. Must have
belonged to an aristocrat.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: My God, she’s beautiful. May I? He mounts her
easily, urges her around the perimeter, greeting the new arrivals. Heads
turn as he trots past. He is the center of attention, and he knows it.
And likes it.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Friends, we are happy to see you safely among
us. But there are many things you must learn about living here… All
attention turns to him. The Lubczanski brothers grumble to each other,
none too pleased with Tuvia’s show-boating.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Once you are settled, you’ll be assigned work
duties. Everyone works, no exceptions.</p>
<p><strong>101a intercut images 101a</strong>: Of people being
introduced to various tasks: shoemaking, sewing, cooking. Asael teaching
them to use guns.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: We will help supply the Russian Partisans by
making clothes, repairing guns.</p>
<p><strong>101b back to tuvia on horseback 101b</strong>: Malbin catches
his eye and winks – clearly this has been part of their “strategy”
discussions.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Women will learn to use weapons and fight
alongside men. Tuvia takes a rifle from Asael and holds it aloft.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: This is not a gun. It is Bar Kochba’s spear.
It is Ehud’s sword. You will all learn to protect yourselves. A LITTLE
BOY holds Lilka’s hand and looks up at Tuvia in wonder. He cuts an
iconic figure.</p>
<p><strong>little boy</strong>: He is a Jew? Lilka is equally struck –
although there is something more than wonder in her regard. She
nods.</p>
<p><strong>tuvu</strong>: Pregnancies are forbidden. We cannot
accommodate an infant’s needs. Our bunkers are overcrowded so you will
have to build new ones. He looks out over the sea of expectant
faces.</p>
<p>****: …This is the one place in all of Belorussia where a Jew can be
free. We will make again, here in this forest, the life that was taken
from you. We welcome you into our community.</p>
<p><strong>101c later - tuvia is walking his horse beside the river
101c</strong>: when Riva stops him.</p>
<p><strong>riva</strong>: You are Tuvia Bielski? You are really him?</p>
<p>****: You are a hero. A Maccabee. She vigorously shakes Tuvia’s hand
and walks away. Tuvia catches his reflection in the water. And likes
it.</p>
<p><strong>102a in an underground bunker - dawn 102a</strong>: Lilka
awakens to find TEN WOMEN wedged in beside her – back to front – like
spoons. Idly, she begins to ITCH her scalp. Then her leg. In the pale
morning light she sees that she is crawling with lice. She SCREAMS. The
women around her wake up, terrified.</p>
<p><strong>lilka</strong>: Get them off! Get them off me!</p>
<p><strong>chaya</strong>: What? Where?</p>
<p><strong>riva</strong>: Lice need somewhere to sleep, too. The others
LAUGH, but Lilka is on the verge of hysteria. She stumbles out, stepping
on several others as she goes.</p>
<p><strong>102b outside the bunker 102b</strong>: Crying, she tears at
her clothes – only to discover Tuvia and OTHERS staring at her with
interest. She is mortified.</p>
<p><strong>102c later that day 102c</strong>: THE WOMEN wash clothes in
the stream. Lilka is by the riverbank, scrubbing furiously. Tamara works
beside her.</p>
<p><strong>tamara</strong>: You get rid of them quicker if you boil
them.</p>
<p><strong>102c continued: 102c</strong>: Lilka is grateful for this bit
of camp wisdom.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Tamara, come on in, it’s freezing and slimy
and horrible. Tamara shakes her head, no.</p>
<p><strong>riva</strong>: So modest…</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: … So last night I dreamed I was taking a real
bath. With hot water.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: And soap.</p>
<p><strong>riva</strong>: And bubbles.</p>
<p><strong>chaya</strong>: Oh, take me to that dream!</p>
<p><strong>riva</strong>: I was dreaming of shoes…</p>
<p><strong>chaya</strong>: Shoes, Riva?</p>
<p><strong>riva</strong>: There was a man in a shop on Grudek street…
and the way he caressed my feet when I tried on his shoes… Riva swoons.
The women burst into ribald laughter. The SOUND of a horse. They look to
the opposite bank where: TUVIA RIDES BY on his horse. Lilka can’t help
but stare.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Doesn’t take a fortune teller to know what
Lilka’s dreaming about… Lilka blushes furiously. The women laugh even
louder.</p>
<p><strong>103 a flat stretch of train track 103</strong>: Gramov shows
Zus how to plant a disk-like CONTACT MINE.</p>
<p><strong>gramov</strong>: –buried underneath with this</p>
<p><strong>detonator–</strong>: –almost touching the rail. As the train
passes, its weight causes pressure on the detonator, and then–</p>
<p><strong>boom!</strong>: Zus falls over, startled. Gramov laughs.
Partisan humor.</p>
<p><strong>104 forest camp #2 104</strong>: Chaya is on kitchen detail
with Tamara.</p>
<p><strong>tamara</strong>: Yesterday, potatoes with beets, Today, beets
with potatoes. Special treat tomorrow…potato soup. With beets. Not far
away, Arkady and several others have created a primitive still – turning
potatoes into vodka.</p>
<p><strong>arkady</strong>: We love potatoes, don’t we, boys! Here, put
some hair on your chest! They give Aron his first taste.</p>
<p><strong>nearby</strong>: Bella is walking, arm in arm, with
Asael.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: So…a little bird told me that a certain
someone is waiting…for another certain someone to ask a certain
question… Go on… She indicates Chaya by wiggling her eyebrows in her
direction. Asael shakes his head but heads in that direction.</p>
<p><strong>104a nearby 104a</strong>: Asael “happens” to bump into
Chaya.</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: Hello, Chaya.</p>
<p><strong>chaya</strong>: Hello, Asael.</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: May…I help you?</p>
<p><strong>chaya</strong>: Wash clothes? I… don’t think so. An awkward
moment as he stands there watching her.</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: Chaya… I…was…wondering…if… maybe…you…I mean…
you and I–</p>
<p><strong>chaya</strong>: I accept.</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: You do?</p>
<p><strong>chaya</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>104b another day 104b</strong>: Asael and Chaya are getting
married. A LIGHT SNOW is falling as they say repeat their vows as Shimon
instructs. Their breath condenses in the cold.</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: Behold thou art consecrated unto me by this
ring according to the Laws of Moses and Israel. But rather than a ring,
Asael gives her a shiny new rifle. As the ceremony continues, we:</p>
<p><strong>104c intercut: a tree line overlooking a muddy road
104c</strong>: Zus, Ben Zion and several BIELSKI FIGHTERS hide alongside
TEN RUSSIAN PARTISANS as a GERMAN TROOP TRUCK approaches. Pachenko
watches as Zus follows the approaching truck through binoculars, then
cocks the heavy machine gun. The truck SLOWS TO A CRAWL as it encounters
an overturned PEASANT CART blocking the road.</p>
<p><strong>104d back to the wedding 104d</strong>: As Asael kisses the
bride, Tuvia is staring not at the newlyweds but rather at Lilka, who
has washed and let down her hair. She glances up and meets his eye, then
looks away. As Asael crushes the traditional glass underfoot:</p>
<p><strong>104e zus opens fire. 104e</strong>: The driver SLUMPS over
the wheel and the truck careens lazily off the road. GERMAN SOLDIERS
spill out, blindly returning fire as Zus’s fighters SWARM down the hill.
Several are HIT right away.</p>
<p><strong>with the frenzy of battle.</strong>: People dance and sing,
their joy juxtaposed with the murderous intensity of the firefight,
their twirling movements a cracked mirror of the death agonies of
fighters of both sides as they are hit and fall.</p>
<p><strong>104f continued: 104f</strong>: Some of the inexperienced
Jewish fighters freeze, some fire their weapons blindly. Ben Zion does
well. ZUS RUNS AMONG THEM, fiercely EXHORTING them to attack.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Get up! Move! SHOOT OR I’LL SHOOT</p>
<p><strong>from a vantage point in the rocks</strong>: Viktor watches,
heartened by Zus’ natural aggression. GERMAN SOLDIERS TAKE COVER behind
the overturned truck effectively RETURNING FIRE. Several partisans are
KILLED. ZUS PULLS A POTATO MASHER GRENADE from his belt and RUNS AT THE
TRUCK in a mad headlong assault.</p>
<p><strong>arrrrggghhhhhhhhhhhhh!</strong>: He ROLLS THE GRENADE under
the truck and dives away as it EXPLODES. The remaining Germans RAISE
THEIR HANDS. CHEERING PARTISANS leap into the truck, capturing an
arsenal of rifles and ammo. THE JEWISH FIGHTERS join in the looting.
Boots, coats, blankets, etc. Zus approaches the wounded and captured
German prisoners, kneeling in surrender, hands behind their necks.
Without hesitation, he shoots them, point-blank, one after another.
VIKTOR approaches Zus, who salutes.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: You are related to Bielski?</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: I am a Bielski, too. Viktor looks at him
appraisingly.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Indeed. He walks away. Zus has found a
home.</p>
<p><strong>104g later - the otriad sings and dances on 104g</strong>: as
SNOW continues to fall. The young marriage is a celebration of hope over
despair.</p>
<p><strong>109 the russian winter 109</strong>: SNOW covers the camp. A
driving wind. Bundled in scarves, overcoats and as many layers as they
can wear, Bella and Chaya break ice in a pot. Tamara takes FROZEN
LAUNDRY from a line. In a bunker, Malbin and Shimon shiver under a
shared blanket. Women and children stare blankly into space. Riva
unwraps rags from a man’s foot and examines his toes, BLACK with
frostbite. Asael and Tuvia are making their rounds. They pass Aron and
Rachel who have built a snowman which they top off by adding a German
helmet with a bullet hole in it.</p>
<p><strong>109a in a storage area 109a</strong>: Asael shows Tuvia the
last few potatoes.</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: There is talk of returning to the ghetto.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Madness.</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: They’ve barely eaten in days. Even when our
food missions manage to get through, there are armed patrols. Farmers
who once helped us now guard their barns with shotguns. Tuvia considers
for a moment.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Send out more missions. And bring shotguns.
Tuvia sets off. In every face he passes, there’s misery and accusation
in the shivering bodies and trembling blue lips. Children stare at him
with sunken, haunted eyes.</p>
<p><strong>109aa a makeshift stable 109aa</strong>: Tuvia visits his
beautiful horse. He unties him.</p>
<p><strong>109ab later - in the food line 109ab</strong>: A whisper runs
through the group…“meat”…“what kind?”…” Where’d it come from?” Tuvia
watches them eat hungrily.</p>
<p><strong>109e a stable - night 109e</strong>: Snow falling outside.
Several partisans are singing. Zus is drinking heavily with Viktor; they
take pinches of salt with each swallow. Viktor finishes a bottle, tosses
it.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Another dead soldier! Zus looks at him,
bleary-eyed, confused. Viktor explains:</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: More dead soldiers than empty bottles.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: That is so…Russian. He cracks open another
bottle and takes a big slug.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: At least you drink like one.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: ‘A Jew can’t drink, a Jew can’t fight.’ What is
it we are good at, Viktor? Dying. That is what we are good at.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: So tell me about this brother of yours…</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: .Asael?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: You are such an idiot.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: I know who you mean… The Great Tuvia Bielski.
Savior of the Jews and all around Big Shit.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: You compete with him.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: He competes with me.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: My older brother and I have the same
relationship.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: He is a Big Shit also?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: A soldier. He was killed in the first hour
of the German invasion. This sobers them up a bit.</p>
<p><strong>109f in the zemylanka 109f</strong>: LILKA is shivering, her
eyes inward and unfocused.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Lilka?</p>
<p><strong>lilka</strong>: Sorry, Tuvia. I was…thinking. It’s nothing.
He looks at her intently, knowing there’s more.</p>
<p><strong>lilka</strong>: …Every time new people come into camp, I keep
hoping… even though, I know…</p>
<p>****: …I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Everyone here has lost someone. She looks up
at him, helpless to be so revealed.</p>
<p><strong>lilka</strong>: You too?</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Here… He takes off his wool coat and puts it
around her shoulders.</p>
<p><strong>lilka</strong>: No. Today I go on my first food mission.
Tuvia’s order has consigned her to this dangerous duty.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: I will have Asael send someone else.</p>
<p><strong>lilka</strong>: No. I must go now. I want to go. She is
clearly scared but desperate not to show it. He reaches into his belt
and hands her a revolver.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: You know how to use this? She nods. Leaving,
she passes the Lubczanski brothers, who are on their way in.</p>
<p><strong>motl lubczanski</strong>: She is a tasty one, your
aristocrat.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: She is not my aristocrat.</p>
<p><strong>arkady lubczanski</strong>: No? We were told, ‘hands off,’
property of the Commander. Tuvia just stares, daring him to
continue.</p>
<p><strong>111 later that day 111</strong>: Tuvia walks past the
now-empty stable heading into the woods. A voice calls out of the misty
snow.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Lazar. I am coming from camp. The danger is
from those coming to camp.</p>
<p>****: Sorry, Tuvia…</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: No sign of the food mission?</p>
<p><strong>lazar</strong>: Not yet. Tuvia looks anxiously into the deep
woods.</p>
<p><strong>111a meanwhile - deep in the woods 111a</strong>: Lilka and
Shulman are walking backwards, retracing their steps to obscure their
footprints in the drifting snow.</p>
<p><strong>shulman</strong>: We mustn’t have any tracks leading back to
base. He loads two sacks of food onto her shoulders.</p>
<p><strong>shulman</strong>: Stay on this side of the creek until you
reach the river then up the hill. I’ll wait here for the others. She
nods and trudges on toward camp through waist-deep snow.</p>
<p><strong>112 back in camp - outside a makeshift infirmary
112</strong>: As they head toward a zemylanka, Riva is briefing Tuvia on
the sick. Every now and then, he glances toward the woods.</p>
<p><strong>riva</strong>: –several cases of pneumonia… Also I’m
beginning to see signs of scurvy. No one’s had a vegetable in weeks.</p>
<p><strong>lazar</strong>: Tuvia! Lazar is dragging a WOUNDED MAN back
into camp.</p>
<p><strong>riva</strong>: Bring him to the infirmary. Tuvia glances back
toward the woods. Looks at his watch.</p>
<p><strong>riva</strong>: …Shulman will look after her. He looks up. She
looks at him sympathetically. Apparently his interest in Lilka isn’
quite as secret as he imagines.</p>
<p><strong>112a back to the woods 112a</strong>: Exhausted, cold and
alone, Lilka is becoming increasingly disoriented in a snowy landscape
where every tree looks</p>
<p><strong>112a continued: 112a</strong>: alike. She turns in a circle,
trying to decide which way to go. A MANGY DOG appears out of nowhere,
its coat matted, its ribs showing, a wild look in its eye. It GROWLS
ferociously.</p>
<p><strong>lilka</strong>: Shoo– Shoo–</p>
<p><strong>112a continued: 112a</strong>: But the dog, as ravenous as
she, smells the food and won’t back down. It inches forward, FOAMING at
the mouth. Lilka tries to step back but the dog LUNGES, snapping its
jaws. It’s terrifying. She looks desperately for help. Suddenly the dog
LEAPS at her. She turns away and it rips a sack from her shoulder,
knocking her down. Viciously it begins tearing the sack apart in search
of the food within. A SHOT RINGS OUT. The dog drops. Lilka holds the
smoking gun in two hands. Grimly, she pockets the weapon, picks up the
sack of food, and starts off. Reconsidering, she walks back and hoists
the dead dog onto her shoulder, too. More food.</p>
<p><strong>112b in the infirmary 112b</strong>: Riva bandages Edjelman’s
head. Tuvia looks at all the sick.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: What’s wrong with them all?</p>
<p><strong>riva</strong>: If it’s typhus we’re in trouble. The lice are
carriers.</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: The partisans have ampicillin. But they say
they need it for themselves. In the background Lilka enters, face
scratched, blood smeared hands and arms – like some kind of primitive
huntress.</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: Tuvia…</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Medicine for typhus. I heard you. I’ll go see
Viktor right away. On his way out, he passes Lilka, who is being looked
after.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>lilka</strong>: Fine. Thank you. Tuvia can clearly see that
she is shaken – but he has no time to ask more. He has to find out about
the medicine.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: I must go.</p>
<p><strong>114 inside a tent 114</strong>: Viktor, Gramov and Zus are
poring over a map of the area.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: –and every time we try to move, they radio
back to police HQ which houses the transmitter…here.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: –So we attack the transmitter.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Yes, yes, my Hebrew warrior. Except for the
troops in Stankiewcze and the machine guns out front. THE TENT FLAP
OPENS. Tuvia enters. He has developed a cough.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Two Bielski’s in one room! To what do we owe
this honor?</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: We have sickness. I need ampicillin.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: This medicine is reserved for fighters.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: If typhus breaks out in our camp, it may
spread to yours.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: I will have to take that chance. Zus looks
from one immovable force to the other.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: I must insist. Comrade.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: You’d better not. Zus is watching this
dick-measuring with keen interest.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: There would be medicine in the police
headquarters at Stankiewcze, yes?</p>
<p><strong>114 continued: 114</strong>: He looks to Gramov, who looks to
Viktor, who nods.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Tuvia and I grew up there. Perhaps the Bielski
otriad will volunteer to take out the transmitter. Viktor looks from Zus
to Tuvia.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Of course. Zus grabs his submachine gun.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Krensky, Ben Zion. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>115 the town of stakiewicze 115</strong>: is quiet at
midnight on this snowy evening.</p>
<p><strong>116 in a back alley 116</strong>: Tuvia and Zus sit in the
cab of an old truck, its exhaust sending plumes of condensation into the
freezing night.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Well… He looks into the back where the others
wait, anxiously clutching their weapons. Tuvia tries to hold back a
cough.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Stay with the truck. And make sure it’s in gear
when we get back.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: I’m going in with you.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: I give the orders tonight. Across the square,
the police station looms.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: You don’t have to do this.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: I don’t? What about the typhus?</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: So more die. They will anyway. A grim smile
from Zus. Tuvia is broken up inside.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: I have been given this mission by my superior
officer. He starts to get out the cab. Tuvia reaches into his pocket,
takes out the mezuzah that once blessed their parents’ home.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Zus… For luck. Zuz pockets it and joins the
others creeping into the shadows. But rather than follow them into the
police station, we HOLD on Tuvia’s face. Suddenly we HEAR The sound of
gunfire. Then nothing. Ten seconds. More gunfire. Twenty. It is
excruciating. Thirty. The longest CLOSE-UP in film history.</p>
<p><strong>117 intercut - flashes of what is happening inside…
117</strong>: Ben Zion bursts in and opens fire, killing two policemen.
Krensky jumps the counter and smashes the transmitter. A policeman
appears behind them on the stairs and shoots Krensky in the back. Ben
Zion whirls and kills him.</p>
<p><strong>opens it. stops. he has promised to wait with the
truck.</strong>: Zus, meanwhile, rummages cabinets, looking for
ampicillin.</p>
<p><strong>ben zion</strong>: Let’s GO! In the back room, Zus keeps
rummaging. A window EXPLODES. Ben Zion is hit. Mortally wounded, he
sinks to his knees, returning fire as Zus reappears.</p>
<p><strong>118 tuvia watches 118</strong>: as Zus bursts out the door.
He races to the truck and struggles into the passenger seat, BLEEDING
FROM HIS</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Go. GO!</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: What about the others?!</p>
<p><strong>119 in the truck 119</strong>: From his coat Zus takes out a
BLOOD-SOAKED PACKAGE.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Medicine.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: The others?</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Fighters die so that malbushim may live, that’s
what you believe, yes? Tuvia absorbs the accusation as if taking a
punch.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: So you’re a communist now, Zus? Zus lays his
head back on the seat, closes his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Communist, Zionist, Manicurist, what difference
does it make? You got your medicine.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Come back to us. Zus won’t look at him.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: You are my brother.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: So you remember.</p>
<p><strong>120 a mourner’s circle in the trees 120</strong>: for Ben
Zion and Krensky. Shimon addresses the group.</p>
<p><strong>shimon</strong>: Merciful God, we commit our friends Ben Zion
and Krensky to your care. We have no more prayers, no more tears. We
have run out of blood. Choose another people We PAN PAST the familiar
faces.</p>
<p><strong>shimon</strong>: We have paid for each of your Commandments.
We have covered every field and stone with ashes. Sanctify another land.
Choose another people. Teach them the Deeds and the Prophecies. Grant us
but one more blessing – Take back the gift of our holiness.</p>
<p><strong>121 in a zemylanka - later that day 121</strong>: Tuvia is
still drinking heavily. He is COUGHING STEADILY, his face sweaty with
fever. The SOUND of angry voices from outside the bunker.</p>
<p><strong>122 outside - in the food line 122</strong>: Arkady
Lubczanski has pulled a knife on Asael, who backs away, STUMBLING into a
group of bystanders.</p>
<p><strong>arkady</strong>: Next time, I cut off your nose, pisher.
Tuvia emerges from his bunker. He is weaving a bit and his words are
slurred.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Whassa problem, Arkady?</p>
<p><strong>arkady</strong>: Those who risk their lives to bring back
food deserve a larger portion than those who risk nothing.</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: Everyone gets the same portion.</p>
<p><strong>arkady</strong>: Not when you’re serving, pisher. I see you
digging to the bottom of the pot for your little forest cutie and her
parents…</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: She is my wife!</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Policy is…Same for all. If someone is
stealing he’ll face consequences. Asael is astonished that Tuvia would
go against him in public and embarrassed by his public drunkenness.</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: What consequences? Others are closely
watching this test of Tuvia’s authority.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Reduced rations for one week. Both of
you.</p>
<p><strong>are you questioning my decision?</strong>: Arkady is tempted
to take him on. But he backs down.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: This matter is settled. Everybody back in
line. People are staring at him.</p>
<p><strong>line!</strong>: His eyes meet Lilka’s. She looks away. Asael
takes Tuvia’s arm and pulls him aside.</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: Tuvia, I would never–</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Yes. I know.</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: Then why am I to be punished…? Tuvia just
takes another swallow from his bottle.</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: Fischer is with them. So is Levine. On food
missions, they take first for themselves and only bring back what’s left
over– Tuvia’s head is throbbing. He closes his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: –and they spread rumors, that you are
power-hungry and corrupt, that you take whatever woman you choose– –that
we keep gold for ourselves, and that– He stops himself.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: –What?</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: …that you drink too much and are no longer
fit to lead us.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: .Maybe they’re right. Asael looks at him. No
longer the brother he once idealized.</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: Zus would have punched him senseless.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Zus.</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: I miss him.</p>
<p><strong>ß tuvia</strong>: He has made his choice. He reels away
toward the woods.</p>
<p><strong>122a in his zemylanka - later 122a</strong>: Tuvia is lying
in his bunker, vomiting and burning up with fever. Shimon has brought
him soup.</p>
<p><strong>shimon</strong>: Drink this.</p>
<p>****: From the bottom of the pot. Tuvia can barely get the soup
down.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: …the way they look at me… with their pasty
faces. Let them starve, we’re all going to die out here anyway.</p>
<p><strong>shimon</strong>: Not easy being the big boss. Moses was a
lonely man when he led us out of bondage.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: …Moses.</p>
<p><strong>shimon</strong>: So I’m a sucker for a biblical allusion. But
what is society without leaders. Without leaders, we falter.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: I am not a leader.</p>
<p><strong>shimon</strong>: Neither was Moses, but somehow that seemed
to work out.</p>
<p><strong>123 the partisan camp 123</strong>: Several partisans are
singing a drinking song while Zus silently soaks his feet in a bucket.
Lova walks in. His face is black and blue.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Lova, what happened? Who did this? Lova sits
and buries his head in his hands.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Lova. Tell me. Who?</p>
<p><strong>lova</strong>: Gramov. Two others. I used the officer’s
latrine.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: For this they beat you? Lova is trying not to
weep.</p>
<p><strong>lova</strong>: They said they wouldn’t shit in the same hole
as a Jew. Zus gets to his feet.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Forgive me, Commander.</p>
<p><strong>panchenko</strong>: Zus. Join us. He offers him a glass of
vodka. Zus doesn’t take it.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: I want to report the mistreatment of a comrade.
Gramov looks up. Zus meets his eye.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: This man beat Comrade Lova – for no reason at
all.</p>
<p><strong>gramov</strong>: I had a perfectly good reason. He is a Jew.
The other men LAUGH. Panchenko frowns at Gramov.</p>
<p><strong>panchenko</strong>: –and you are an ignorant Tartar. Ignore
him. Here…</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Anti-semitism is a violation of Party
discipline. Panchenko sighs. Does he really have to deal with this?</p>
<p><strong>panchenko</strong>: He’s right, Gramov. Apologize to the
Jew.</p>
<p><strong>gramov</strong>: I apologize, Jew.</p>
<p><strong>panchenko</strong>: There. You see? Now drink up. Zus doesn’t
know what to do. He accepts the vodka.</p>
<p><strong>126 the blurred image of an angel framed by a halo of
sunlight 126</strong>: as it swims into focus. Tuvia opens his eyes. It
is Lilka. She sits beside him, mopping his forehead with a cool rag.</p>
<p><strong>lilka</strong>: Your fever broke in the night. The medicine
helped.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: How long was I asleep?</p>
<p><strong>lilka</strong>: Two days.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: And you’ve nursed me the whole time?</p>
<p><strong>lilka</strong>: Chaya helped.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Did you study nursing at university?</p>
<p><strong>lilka</strong>: We devoted ourselves to more essential
knowledge – like Greek Philosophy and Latin.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: I never went to university.</p>
<p><strong>lilka</strong>: What kind of work did you do? Before.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: My wife’s father had a store. Before the Race
Laws. She is is dead.</p>
<p><strong>lilka</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Tell me more about university.</p>
<p><strong>lilka</strong>: It all feels like a dream. I spent months
trying to master Chopin’s nocturnes.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: I’d love to hear you play.</p>
<p><strong>lilka</strong>: You know Chopin?</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Who doesn’t? Chopin the butcher from
Novogrudok.</p>
<p>****: If you’re well enough to tease me, you’re well enough to eat.
I’ll see what’s for supper. She gets up to go.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Thank you, Lilka.</p>
<p><strong>127 outside tuvia’s bunker 127</strong>: THE LUBCZANSKI’S
have taken the fullest advantage of Tuvia’s illness. There are now TWO
LINES of people waiting for food. The malbushim line up like prison
inmates. Lazar looks into his bowl – two beans floating in a scummy
broth.</p>
<p><strong>in the shorter line</strong>: Motl, Arkady, Fischer, Levine
and a few others are enjoying real food. Lazar calls out from the other
line.</p>
<p><strong>lazar</strong>: Hey, Arkady This isn’t soup, it’s piss.</p>
<p><strong>arkady</strong>: I will piss on your head and you will say
it’s raining. Eat it. The rest of Lubczanski’s cabal laughs. TUVIA
emerges from his bunker. The first thing he sees is Asael, whose face is
BATTERED AND SWOLLEN.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: What happened? Asael just looks over at the
food line – where Arkady has grabbed Chaya by the waist – to the delight
of the others. Tuvia strides over to them.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p><strong>arkady</strong>: New policy. Fighters get better food.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Against my orders…</p>
<p><strong>arkady</strong>: You are no longer Commander. Sorry. Tuvia
nods, considering his remark for a moment.</p>
<p><strong>and then takes out his pistol and shoots arkady in the
chest!</strong>: He then turns the gun on Motl and the others – they
literally cower in fear. He raises his voice to those watching.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: As long as I am the leader of this group, you
will obey my commands.</p>
<p><strong>nothing. anyone wants to leave,</strong>: THEY LEAVE. NOW!
The rest work. Every morning we get up and we work. WE WORK. In the snow
and the cold and the dark. Tomorrow we begin to build ten new zemylanka,
we double the number of food missions. …We work. Take his body into the
woods and leave it for the wolves. He turns and walks away. As he passes
the food lines, people subtly move out of his way and whisper after he
is gone.</p>
<p><strong>127 continued: 127</strong>: Whereas once he was greeted
warmly by all, now his isolation is complete. He is the Commander.</p>
<p><strong>127a tuvia careens through the trees 127a</strong>: Tripping
over roots, and finally leaning against a tree, he is mumbling, almost
incoherent – part prayer, part profanity.</p>
<p><strong>129 the first bud of spring 129</strong>: struggles through
patches of snow. Ice drips from branches.</p>
<p><strong>130a the otriad 130a</strong>: Takes a group portrait. The
forest is green again.</p>
<p><strong>131 the sunshine is warm 131</strong>: on the women’s bodies
as they bathe in the river.</p>
<p><strong>chaya</strong>: Who has the soap? I know there was a little
left?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Use the sand. It’s good for your skin.</p>
<p><strong>riva</strong>: And what skin! And already married, too! Bella
laughs. Chaya splashes her playfully with water.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: I’ve turned into a skeleton.</p>
<p><strong>chaya</strong>: And you were always so worried about staying
slim.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: When we get out of this forest I am going to
eat only cake and grow as big as a house. Tamara appears. She’s wearing
a long overcoat.</p>
<p><strong>lilka</strong>: Join us. At least the sun is warm.
Tamara?</p>
<p><strong>tamara</strong>: I can’t, Lilka… I’m pregnant.</p>
<p><strong>lilka</strong>: I had no idea.</p>
<p><strong>tamara</strong>: I’ve kept it hidden for months but now it’s
obvious. No one can know. They move away from the others. Tamara shows
her.</p>
<p><strong>tamara</strong>: It could come any day.</p>
<p><strong>lilka</strong>: ..Who is the father?</p>
<p><strong>tamara</strong>: I— It was when I was escaping. A man with a
gun stopped me. I thought he was a Partisan. He told me to follow him
and he took me to this place… The memory overwhelms her. She begins to
break down.</p>
<p><strong>tamara</strong>: Inside me something broke….I wanted to die.
Every night I have nightmares – what will happen when Tuvia finds
out.</p>
<p><strong>lilka</strong>: He will understand.</p>
<p><strong>tamara</strong>: No. You mustn’t tell him!</p>
<p><strong>lilka</strong>: I won’t. Don’t worry. What are you going to
do? Tamara’s eyes fill with a new resolve.</p>
<p><strong>tamara</strong>: I feel this new life inside me. It’s the
only thing keeping me going. I won’t give it up, I’ll kill myself. Lilka
puts her arm around her.</p>
<p><strong>131a in the deep forest – aron is out hunting 131a</strong>:
From his belt hang the pelts of two dead rabbits. He hears A SOUND.
Three GERMAN SOLDIERS are putting camouflage on their helmets. Beyond, A
GERMAN ARMORED COLUMN. The assault is coming.</p>
<p><strong>132 the camp 132</strong>: where Shimon and Malbin are
playing chess. Shimon has developed a bad cough.</p>
<p><strong>malbin</strong>: You call that a move?</p>
<p><strong>shimon</strong>: I call it an inevitable conclusion based on
unimpeachable reasoning.</p>
<p><strong>shimon</strong>: The question, my friend the Genius, is what
are you going to do about it.</p>
<p><strong>malbin</strong>: I’m thinking about what I’m going to do
about it.</p>
<p><strong>shimon</strong>: Aha! I got him!</p>
<p><strong>malbin</strong>: You didn’t get me. You think you got me? How
about this?</p>
<p>****: Who would make a move like that?</p>
<p><strong>malbin</strong>: A genius maybe. Tuvia has been listening
nearby. Aron races into the camp.</p>
<p><strong>aron</strong>: Tuvia… We SEE Aron whispering in Tuvia’s
ear.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Asael! Asael comes running.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Get a message to Zus. He’s got to tell Viktor
they’re coming.</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: Lazar spotted another patrol. They’re getting
closer. Tuvia nods. Suddenly, he HEARS a strange sound. An animal?</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Do you hear that?</p>
<p><strong>134 in the women’s zemylanka 134</strong>: We HEAR the SOUND
for what it is… The cry of a newborn. A baby boy in this mud manger.
Riva and Lilka have assisted. Tamara holds her new baby to her breast.
Suddenly – the blanket serving as a door is SWEPT ASIDE. TUVIA stands
there. Tamara cries out and shields the baby. Lilka springs up and
pushes him back outside.</p>
<p><strong>135 outside the bunker 135</strong>: Tuvia walks angrily.
Lilka keeps up.</p>
<p><strong>lilka</strong>: She promises not to take extra food…</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: This is against my orders.</p>
<p><strong>lilka</strong>: So you are going to shoot her, too? Tuvia
stares at her. He has never seen this side of her.</p>
<p><strong>lilka</strong>: Please, Tuvia. The baby is all she has to
live for.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: I cannot allow it. He turns away.</p>
<p><strong>135 continued: 135</strong>: Lilka SPINS him around,
surprising him with her strength and the strength of her passion.</p>
<p><strong>lilka</strong>: You must let it live!</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: I cannot keep the living alive. Tamara and
the man who fathered this child are responsible for its fate.</p>
<p><strong>lilka</strong>: She was raped by the Nazis. Tuvia closes his
eyes. He is tired of being in charge, tired of being the arbiter of
other peoples’ fate.</p>
<p><strong>lilka</strong>: …You tell us to hold onto our humanity. Not
to become like animals. What better way than by bringing a life into
this world of suffering and death. It’s our only hope. Tuvia is undone
by her intensity. The very nearness of her. The smell of her
newly-washed hair. The glow of her skin. He looks at her. And nods in
surrender.</p>
<p><strong>lilka</strong>: Thank you, Tuvia. She kisses him. A chaste
kiss of gratitude. She pulls back and they look into each other’s eyes.
The next kiss is something entirely different.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Lilka…</p>
<p><strong>lilka</strong>: I knew what was expected of the women here –
yet you never touched me…</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Shhh..</p>
<p><strong>lilka</strong>: I’m not afraid of anything, Tuvia. I’m not
even afraid of you. They kiss deeply.</p>
<p><strong>136 in tuvia’s bunker - later 136</strong>: Lilka lies in his
arms.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: The Germans are coming into the forest. I
don’t know what is going to become of us.</p>
<p><strong>lilka</strong>: It doesn’t matter. If I had stayed in the
ghetto I’d be dead. You saved my life.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: No. You have saved mine. He reaches for her
but before they can begin to make love again– THE BLANKET DOOR IS PUSHED
ASIDE. Malbin is there.</p>
<p><strong>malbin</strong>: Oh… ..I….. Hello, Lilka.</p>
<p><strong>lilka</strong>: Hello, Asael.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>malbin</strong>: We’ve caught one.</p>
<p><strong>137 a german ss scout, hands tied behind his back
137</strong>: is led into the clearing. He wears the same uniform as
those who marched the villagers into the forest for execution.</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: He’s a scout.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: They’re coming for us. Group members have
begun to gather around him. They begin to hurl insults – schtik drek,
paskudnyak – as the hapless man is pushed to his knees.</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: We found this in his pouch. He hands Tuvia a
sheaf of documents – including a map.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Entrance points, wetlands, obstacles. You
read this.</p>
<p><strong>shimon</strong>: They’ve assigned an entire division to
surround the forest. A tidal wave is coming.</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: Don’t they have a war to fight?</p>
<p><strong>shimon</strong>: Assault begins in two days. Passover. How
fitting. Meanwhile, some of the group have begun TORMENTING the man.</p>
<p><strong>motl</strong>: Monster! He kicks him in the head.</p>
<p><strong>shulman</strong>: Bulvan! Shulman PUNCHES him in the
face.</p>
<p><strong>german courier</strong>: Bitte….Bitte…</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Did you reach Viktor?</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: He’s on his way. The tormenting of the poor
courier is gaining intensity.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia–</strong>: The German lets loose a torrent of
pleading.</p>
<p><strong>german courier</strong>: Ich habe frau und kinder!</p>
<p><strong>shimon</strong>: He says he has a wife and children. Lazar
picks up a stick. The German tries to crawl away; the crowd blocks his
escape, pushing him back into the center.</p>
<p><strong>lazar</strong>: So did I!</p>
<p><strong>riva</strong>: If you let him go, he will lead them back
here. Tuvia looks at Malbin. What to do?</p>
<p><strong>malbin</strong>: Ask if he’ll promise not to reveal our
location. Shimon translates.</p>
<p><strong>shimon</strong>: Sie mussen versprechen nicht zu sagan wo wir
sind. The man looks up at him, pleadingly.</p>
<p><strong>german courier</strong>: Nein….Nein…</p>
<p><strong>shulman</strong>: He’ll say anything. He breaks the stick
across the man’s back.</p>
<p><strong>lazar</strong>: We want justice…</p>
<p><strong>motl</strong>: Justice… Soon it is a chant: “Justice!
.Justice!” Tuvia looks at their faces. Only months ago they were
decorous, civilized. Now they are hungry, almost feral. Murderous. Bella
has been silently watching. She steps into the circle, looks down at the
terrified German man.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: My son’s name was David. David Kagan. We SEE
now that she is holding a sharpened hoe.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: He was fifteen. He had blue eyes. She raises
it above her head.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: He played the piano. She swings with all her
might. The others watch with a mix of thrilled horror and perverse
delight. A line has been crossed. Riva steps forward, holding a large
shovel.</p>
<p><strong>riva</strong>: My sister’s name was Ellie… As she swings the
shovel, the CAMERA begins to back away. Miriam steps forward, carrying a
large rock.</p>
<p><strong>miriam</strong>: My husband was Meyer… The group closes in,
obscuring our view of the body. Aron can’t take any more. He runs off
into the woods.</p>
<p><strong>motl</strong>: My parents, Sol and Raya.</p>
<p><strong>avram</strong>: For my daughter, Sonya.</p>
<p><strong>mordecai</strong>: For my mother.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: My sister.</p>
<p><strong>lilka</strong>: My whole family.</p>
<p><strong>justice! justice! .</strong>: Tuvia closes his eyes. He has
done nothing to stop it. Asael looks at Malbin and Shimon. They are
undone by what they have witnessed. Tuvia walks away. Behind them, the
group separates – staring at the lifeless body on the ground. And then
they look at each other, their blood lust sated, beginning to reckon
with what they have done. What they have become.</p>
<p><strong>138 tuvia stands alone in the forest, his face in shadow
138</strong>: He sees Aron, squatting beside a tree, crying silently.
Tuvia kneels beside him, cradling him.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Reeboynoy shel oylum… Lord of the Universe.
We have done unspeakable things yet still I seek your mercy… He HEARS
something. Malbin waits at the edge of the forest. His face is drawn and
pale from what has just happened.</p>
<p><strong>malbin</strong>: Viktor is here.</p>
<p><strong>139 viktor and zus 139</strong>: are waiting in the clearing.
Tuvia approaches. He and Zus nod to each other but do not speak. It is
excruciating. Tuvia and Viktor walk into the woods. Zus waits with other
BODYGUARDS as Asael joins them. Zus wears a Nazi jacket.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: He doesn’t look good.</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: I could say the same about you. Where’d you
get the jacket?</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Let’s just say the former owner no longer had
need of it. Zus winks. The other bodyguards stare impassively.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Embrace me. Asael looks confused for a moment,
then embraces him.</p>
<p>****: Hide this. Wolnicky stores ammunition for us in his barn.
There’s no guard. He slaps Asael fondly on the cheek and rejoins his
comrades.</p>
<p><strong>140 viktor and tuvia 140</strong>: sit on a downed tree and
converse in Russian, with subtitles:</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: You found these on the prisoner? Tuvia nods.
Viktor studies the scout’s documents. Tisking.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: We can’t fight an entire division.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: The battle on the Eastern Front has begun.
The more troops we engage here, the fewer they have to attack the
Motherland.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: We’ve done our part for the Motherland.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: My orders are to take command of all
partisan operations. You will bring the rest of your fighters to me.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: And the others? Old people, women and
children.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: In war there are casualties.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: And if I refuse?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: You are officially a deserter. Do you know
the policy on dealing with deserters? Viktor unfolds a paper flyer from
his pocket.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: …The Germans are offering fifty thousand
marks for information leading to your capture. Not a very flattering
likeness. Too Jewish. Viktor rejoins his bodyguards, turns back for a
last word.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Have your men in my camp by tonight. He
walks off. Asael takes the wanted poster from Tuvia.</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: I wouldn’t show this around. There are some
who’d turn you in for less.</p>
<p><strong>141 later - a spotter plane buzzes high above - hunting
141</strong>: Down below, Viktor and the Russian partisans have struck
their tents and hidden beneath the sheltering trees. Viktor’s gaze
follows the plane. He gives an order into a field radio. Zus has been
listening.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: You want them to find Tuvia’s camp. Viktor just
looks at him.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: You’re deliberately sacrificing them so we can
remain safe?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: No. So we can keep fighting. Everyone must
sacrifice in the struggle.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Those are my brothers.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: I am your brother! He is your brother!
Comrade Zus. Your Jewish sentimentality is heart-warming, but
counter-revolutionary. Zus has secretly known he would hear these words.
He grips his rifle but holds his tongue.</p>
<p><strong>142 the spotter plane – flies over the bielski camp
142</strong>: Tuvia stares up at it. Have they been spotted? Shimon is
sitting nearby with a group of children. He looks pale. His cough is
worse. He is very ill.</p>
<p><strong>shimon</strong>: …but the children of Israel were afraid to
leave Egypt. Until Moses said, ‘Do not trust in me, trust in God.’ He
will take care of you’ And so tomorrow we celebrate the Passover by
sitting around and arguing just as we have done for centuries. Tuvia
stares at them, a curious expression on his face. Malbin comes to stand
beside him.</p>
<p><strong>malbin</strong>: Did it see us?</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Tomorrow is Passover. Yes?</p>
<p><strong>malbin</strong>: …How should I know?</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Moses. The Exodus. Malbin doesn’t get it at
first.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: –He left before Pharaoh could stop them. Now
Malbin understands. He looks at Shimon.</p>
<p><strong>malbin</strong>: You want to move them all? The old, the
sick. They’ll never make it. It isn’t the first time Tuvia has consigned
people to their death, and apparently it won’t be the last.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: We leave now. Spread the word.</p>
<p><strong>143 moments later - the bielski camp 143</strong>: is a blur
of activity as everyone mobilizes for evacuation. Sacks and cooking
equipment is tied onto impromptu packs. Asael and Malbin coax the older
people into motion–</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: Come, tateh–</p>
<p><strong>oppenheim</strong>: But my tools– The SOUND of approaching
aircraft. Tuvia searches the sky. Riva pairs each of the elderly with a
child. Tamara tucks her newborn under her coat. The SOUND of the
approaching aircraft grows LOUDER. People look up, shielding their eyes.
Then from out of the sun, two ominous silhouettes:</p>
<p><strong>144 the screaming whistle of the first bomber 144</strong>:
panics the crowd.</p>
<p><strong>144 continued: 144</strong>: Some race into the forest;
others are frozen. Tuvia grabs people and bodily drags them to cover.
STRAFING 20MM CANNON chew up the ground. Several people are hit before
they can reach cover. Lilka herds everyone she can into:</p>
<p><strong>145 a bunker 145</strong>: where people crowd in like
sardines. Chaya and Riva gather children around them. They hear the
WHISTLE of an incoming shell….BOOM! Dirt from the roof rains down on
them.</p>
<p><strong>146 bombs begin to rain down 146</strong>: Dirt and debris
everywhere. AN INCENDIARY SHELL HITS high in a tree. Its branches burst
into flame. An hysterical woman leaps out of a bunker and is BLOWN
APART.</p>
<p><strong>147 meanwhile - in viktor’s camp 147</strong>: Zus listens
helplessly to the distant sound of bombs dropping on his brothers.</p>
<p><strong>148 back in the bielski camp - a direct hit on a zemylanka
148</strong>: It explodes into a million pieces. Wood shrapnel
everywhere. Where once was a bunker, now there is only a gaping crater.
Tuvia races into the maelstrom to help the wounded.</p>
<p><strong>an explosion knocks him down</strong>: He tries to clear his
head but he cannot focus. ALL SOUND FADES AWAY to be replaced by a
high-pitched hum.</p>
<p><strong>149 tuvia’s world is in slow-motion 149</strong>: Falling
dirt and debris, tumbling bodies, exploding bunkers – a surreal
effect.</p>
<p><strong>150 in real time – the camp is being torn apart 150</strong>:
Cowering in safety, Malbin sees Tuvia lying in the open and gathers his
courage – RACING through danger to his side.</p>
<p><strong>malbin</strong>: Are you alright? Tuvia shakes his head,
points to his ears. He cannot hear.</p>
<p><strong>are…you…alright?</strong>: When Tuvia speaks, his WORDS sound
DULL and MUFFLED.</p>
<p><strong>the germans…coming…!</strong>: Malbin looks around, panicked.
Asael appears out of the smoke, yells at Malbin above the din.</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: Get them out of the bunkers! Malbin runs off.
Asael helps Tuvia to his feet. A nearby explosion SHOWERS THEM with dirt
as they CRAWL to safety. The world RAMPS BACK TO NORMAL SPEED at a
dizzying rate.</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: We need to hold them off…until the rest are
safe. Tuvia still can’t hear. Asael pantomimes firing a rifle.</p>
<p><strong>…hold…them…off!</strong>: Tuvia nods, trying to clear the
buzzing in his head.</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: With Levine and Miriam… There. Lazar, Rosa,
and Schmuel. There and there. And me. Tuvia shakes his head, no.</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: Yes. He runs off. Still clearing his head,
Tuvia regains his footing – suddenly realizing the the bombing has
stopped.</p>
<p><strong>151 at the entry way to a zemylanka 151</strong>: Malbin
appears, eyes wild.</p>
<p><strong>malbin</strong>: Everybody out! Now! But the group’s natural
reaction is to stay huddled in safety</p>
<p><strong>the cossacks are coming!</strong>: This gets the job done.
People begin to crawl out.</p>
<p><strong>152 others emerge from the bunkers 152</strong>: YOUNG PEOPLE
holding hands with OLD, PARENTS with CHILDREN on their backs. Tuvia
urges Lilka and Bella to hurry them into the woods.</p>
<p><strong>153 meanwhile – the assigned defenders, men and women alike
153</strong>: take up their assigned positions: Levine mans the heavy
machine gun behind a log; Lazar, Miriam and Rosa in the trees. Tuvia
anxiously waits for the last of the women and children to disappear into
the forest.</p>
<p><strong>a sudden silence descends - everyone looks to the
sky</strong>: Tuvia realizes the bombers have broken off their attack.
He knows the ground troops will soon follow. He turns to Asael, grabbing
his shoulders.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Don’t try to fight… Just slow them down. Then
join us. Asael nods. No need for more words. They embrace fiercely.
Asael pushes Chaya toward Tuvia.</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: Take her. She resists, clinging to his arm
for a moment.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Come. He forces her to join him and catch up
to the others.</p>
<p><strong>154 the camp 154</strong>: is eerily quiet as the dust begins
to settle. The defenders check their weapons with grim efficiency. They
are no longer inept innocents; they have become warriors.</p>
<p><strong>155 deeper in the woods 155</strong>: Tuvia catches up with
the fleeing group and urges them on.</p>
<p><strong>156 moments later – the defenders wait anxiously
156</strong>: We study their faces. Beautiful in their stoic
acceptance.</p>
<p><strong>156 continued: 156</strong>: SUDDENLY – A FUSILLADE from the
woods. Rosa falls dead. The defenders RETURN FIRE. Levine fires the
machine gun; Miriam feeds the belt.</p>
<p><strong>157 up ahead with the fleeing group 157</strong>: Tuvia hears
small arms fire. He knows what it means.</p>
<p><strong>158 back at the camp 158</strong>: The rear guard action
can’t hold out for very long. Tree by tree, they begin to fall back.
Asael fires blindly into the murky shadows. The SOUND of a man crying
out. Then Levine is hit. Miriam pushes him out of the way and TAKES
OVER. She expertly kills several assault troops who appear out of the
woods. The rest of the attackers TAKE COVER.</p>
<p><strong>159 with the fleeing group 159</strong>: Malbin waits
anxiously for Tuvia, clutching a map.</p>
<p><strong>malbin</strong>: This swamp here…goes…for miles.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Show me.</p>
<p><strong>160 back at the camp 160</strong>: Lazar runs from tree to
tree, keeping up a steady stream of fire. He is surprisingly brave.
Until A GRENADE flies out of the woods and lands at his feet, killing
him instantly. The Assault Troops have begun to outflank them. Asael is
suddenly in jeopardy. Sara sees the danger.</p>
<p><strong>go!</strong>: Miriam keeps their ATTACKERS pinned down as the
two men race for new positions. Then she is hit. She keeps firing
anyway, her finger locked on the trigger even as she is dying. More
troops begin firing from their flank. Asael has no choice but to break
off. They race into the woods.</p>
<p><strong>161 back to the fleeing group 161</strong>: Tuvia hears the
guns go silent. This, too, has meaning.</p>
<p><strong>162 a rise reveals the immensity of the krasnaya gorka swamp
162</strong>: Malbin stares at what lies ahead.</p>
<p><strong>malbin</strong>: Oh, my God…</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Are the others back yet? stricken; he shakes
..Asael? Malbin shakes his head once more. Asael is not coming back.
Chaya begins to weep. Riva comforts her.</p>
<p><strong>shulman</strong>: We’ve got to keep going!</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: The Germans will be here any minute!</p>
<p><strong>malbin</strong>: Do we wait…a while?</p>
<p><strong>mordecai</strong>: We could hide…</p>
<p><strong>man #3</strong>: I say, fight them here.</p>
<p><strong>motl</strong>: Yes. Fight!</p>
<p><strong>shulman</strong>: That’s crazy! Tuvia is in hell. If he waits
for Asael, he risks them all being caught. Suddenly it all falls apart.
Tuvia sinks to his knees as if his legs can no longer bear his
weight.</p>
<p><strong>malbin</strong>: Tuvia–? Tuvia can’t speak. He has no more
answers. Nothing to say. He stares at the impenetrable swamp. The end of
the line. The sudden vacuum of leadership is felt by them all. They
stare at one another, anxious and rudderless.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: My father cannot make it.</p>
<p><strong>rona</strong>: There are snakes– Tamara’s newborn is crying.
She tries to comfort it. An old woman stares at the swamp in terror.</p>
<p><strong>man #1</strong>: The children…</p>
<p><strong>shulman</strong>: We’ll put them on our shoulders.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Tuvia, what do we do? Oppenheim is petrified.
Rona is crying.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia–</strong>: And still Tuvia is silent. More arguing. A
general MURMUR of dread is rising. Malbin goes to kneel beside Shimon,
who is covered in sweat – undone by the forced march.</p>
<p><strong>malbin</strong>: What’s wrong with him?</p>
<p><strong>shimon</strong>: …He… ..is… ..tired. Malbin hears something,
looks up.</p>
<p><strong>from high above - the spotter plane appears</strong>: They
have been found. Lilka kneels beside Tuvia.</p>
<p><strong>162 continued: 162</strong>: She takes his hand silently.</p>
<p><strong>come–</strong>: He shakes his head.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: You have a weapon? She shows him her
revolver. He checks the clip, then looks into her eyes.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Use it on yourself before you let them take
you. She nods gravely. Suddenly a VOICE interrupts.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Why are we stopping? Everyone turns. It’s
Asael. Back from the dead. He hands off a wounded comrade to Riva’s
care.</p>
<p>****: They’re coming! Why aren’t we moving? Tuvia looks up at him,
lost. Almost helpless.</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: We must keep going!</p>
<p><strong>tamara</strong>: In there?</p>
<p><strong>rona</strong>: It is impossible! More murmuring. Asael raises
his voice.</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: Nothing is impossible! What we have done is
impossible! The murmuring quiets. Asael meets Tuvia’s eyes. He is
literally willing his older brother to be strong for them, as he has
been, time and again.</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: God will not part these waters. We will do it
ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>rona</strong>: But how?</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: Not by miracles. By our strength.</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: Take the rope from your pack. Now, you….give
me your belt.</p>
<p><strong>shulman</strong>: We don’t have enough rope.</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: We’ll link arms. Make a chain. A human
chain.</p>
<p><strong>motl</strong>: What are you talking about? Tuvia is deeply
moved. His little brother has become a man. Once more, he finds his
voice.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Each person takes care of the other. .Give
him your belt. Asael nods at Tuvia gratefully. The group is hushed,
apprehensive. Then:</p>
<p><strong>one man</strong>: Removes his belt and offers it to
Asael.</p>
<p><strong>another stands, holding his belt</strong>: And then another.
One by one they offer them. There is something quietly heroic in the
gesture. Tuvia looks at the group, looks away, fighting back
emotion.</p>
<p><strong>162a they wade in, waist high 162a</strong>: People link arms
and hold on for dear life yet still they flounder. A man goes under, is
pulled up. A harrowing undertaking.</p>
<p><strong>162aa the belts are roped across the deep pool
162aa</strong>: People cling to it as they drag themselves, hand over
hand.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: No tracks on land. Get back in. It is almost
impossible to make any progress. Especially when one is weak and
malnourished.</p>
<p><strong>162c in a deep bog 162c</strong>: The mud sticks to their
clothes, faces. Soon they are indistinguishable from their surroundings.
When one person sinks in the muck, it takes three to get him back on his
feet. The column slows. Tuvia gestures for them to keep moving. They
can’t. Literally cannot. He begins to physically push them on. Sometimes
harshly. Eventually they are moving again.</p>
<p><strong>163 a ghostly landscape 163</strong>: Gnarled bare trees
shrouded in mist. They trudge forward, their expressions wan and empty.
Tuvia find Malbin and pulls him aside.</p>
<p>****: How much farther? Malbin shrugs his shoulders. Who knows…?</p>
<p><strong>163a the water is almost head high 163a</strong>: Parents
hoist children onto their shoulders, hold weapons overhead as they claw
at tall reeds to propel themselves forward, step by tortuous step.
SHIMON clings to a tree. His wracking cough is terrifying and he is
deathly pale.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Come… Shimon can’t catch his breath, he just
shakes his head, no. He can’t go on. Tuvia half-drags, half-carries him
onward.</p>
<p><strong>164 a spit of land in the swamp - dusk 164</strong>: They
rest, eat what little food is left. A litter carrying Shimon is
deposited on dry ground. He is barely alive.</p>
<p><strong>malbin</strong>: Is he…? Tuvia shakes his head. It’s only a
matter of time. The Spotter Plane drones overhead.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Take off your glasses. Reflections. Tuvia
moves off to check on the others.</p>
<p><strong>malbin</strong>: Shimon, listen to me, the physical plane is
just an illusion. Only the spiritual plane is real.</p>
<p><strong>shimon</strong>: No. The physical plane is where man acts to
redeem himself.</p>
<p><strong>malbin</strong>: You’ve redeemed yourself enough, you should
shut up now.</p>
<p><strong>shimon</strong>: Look who’s talking about shutting up… I need
to tell you something.</p>
<p><strong>malbin</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>shimon</strong>: You shouldn’t think so much. The world
around you is beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>malbin</strong>: This world?</p>
<p><strong>shimon</strong>: Even this one. Tuvia has come to sit beside
Lilka. She leans into him.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: We’re lost.</p>
<p><strong>lilka</strong>: No. ..No. She puts her arms around him.</p>
<p><strong>164 continued: 164</strong>: They hold each other and drift
off to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>165 at nightfall - a squad of german soldiers 165</strong>:
sit around a campfire at the edge of the swamp.</p>
<p><strong>from nearby</strong>: The LIGHTS of their fire can be seen
flickering through the reeds as the ragged column MOVES SILENTLY
past.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Not a sound. Pass the word. We watch as the
ORDER is passed down the line. Parents hold hands over their childrens’
mouths. Shimon is carried on an improvised litter made of branches.</p>
<p><strong>166 a forest crossroads 166</strong>: Panchenko and a few
others are on horseback. Behind them the rest of the Partisans are
marching away. Zus and the Jewish fighters are on foot, awaiting
orders.</p>
<p><strong>panchenko</strong>: You will hold this crossroads until the
brigade has completed its retreat. Zus looks around at the position.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: For how long? Panchenko’s orders are never to
be questioned.</p>
<p><strong>panchenko</strong>: Until you are ordered to withdraw.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: And if we cannot hold the position? Panchenko
looks at Gramov, who stands nearby cradling a submachine gun.</p>
<p><strong>panchenko</strong>: Comrade Gramov will enforce discipline,
if necessary. Gramov smiles. The implications are clear: nobody
retreats.</p>
<p><strong>panchenko</strong>: You have served us well, Comrade.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: I am so honored, Comrade. Panchenko wheels his
horse and gallops off. Zus and his men take cover in the woods. In the
distance we can HEAR the unmistakable SOUND of approaching armor. Lova
kneels beside Zus.</p>
<p><strong>lova</strong>: What are we doing here? Zus? Half a mile down
the road, A TANK rumbles into view.</p>
<p><strong>lova</strong>: Tell me. Who are we doing this for? With a
shaking hand, Zus tries to light a Molotov cocktail but his matches are
wet. He reaches into his pocket for more. Instead he finds the mezuzah
that was once affixed to his family’s door. As he stares at it, the
SOUND of the approaching tank grows louder.</p>
<p><strong>167 the krasnaya gorka swamp 167</strong>: empties at last
into a shallow river. On the opposite bank is dry land, and beyond, the
deep forest. And safety. The bedraggled group makes their way
across.</p>
<p><strong>169 on the opposite bank 169</strong>: Asael pulls people up
onto dry ground. They lie there, freezing and exhausted. Some cannot
control their shivering.</p>
<p><strong>shulman</strong>: What’s next…Sinai? Tuvia can’t help but
laugh. Soon they are all laughing. It ripples throughout the group.
Joyous. Contagious. An overwhelming feeling of relief. They are safe.
Tuvia lies on the ground. All the adrenaline has suddenly left his body.
Then Aron appears, tugging at his sleeve. Shimon is asking for him.
Tuvia kneels down beside his teacher, whose eyes are closed. Malbin is
weeping quietly. Who will he argue with?</p>
<p><strong>shimon</strong>: .Tuvia…</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Right here. Shimon is at the end.</p>
<p><strong>shimon</strong>: …Something…to say…</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Shhhh…</p>
<p><strong>shimon</strong>: …no…please… I almost lost…my faith….but
you…were sent..by God..to save us.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>shimon</strong>: I know… … But just…in case… .I thank….HIM…
.and I thank you. He closes his eyes. It’s too much for Tuvia. Hard as
he tries, he cannot stop the tears from filling his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>170 suddenly – up the riverbank 170</strong>: Trees begin to
FALL OVER – as if pushed by a dinosaur.</p>
<p><strong>a panzer tank</strong>: emerges onto the banks, less than a
quarter-of-mile away.</p>
<p><strong>its turret begins to swivel</strong>: The menacing gun
turning in their direction.</p>
<p><strong>171 the group is caught out in the open. 171</strong>: THE
TANK ROARS FIRE. The first round EXPLODES among them. Several are
killed.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Back to the river! He pushes people down.
They cling to the banks, cowering. THOSE WITH WEAPONS take cover, using
the embankment as if it were the lip of a trench. They RETURN FIRE – old
men, young women, even some children.</p>
<p><strong>172 a squad of german infantry advances 172</strong>: behind
the tank, using it as protection. Aron kills one. But the Germans are
well-trained. They direct a withering fire – forcing the partisans to
keep their heads below the embankment.</p>
<p><strong>but the tank is unstoppable</strong>: It turns its attentions
on the riverbank – its first round SAILS OVERHEAD, sending up a huge
geyser of water. But the next round PLOWS INTO THE EARTH, tearing a huge
chunk of earth and killing two of the brigade. TUVIA grabs a satchel and
begins filling it with grenades. He throws the satchel over Malbin’s
head, grabs his arm and races, crouching low, beneath the lip of the
riverbank. Asael provides covering fire. So do Lilka, Chaya and the
women alongside the men.</p>
<p><strong>up ahead</strong>: A stand of trees hides Tuvia from view as
he climbs out of the river and heads into the forest. He pulls Malbin
down just as A SQUAD OF GERMAN INFANTRY approaches and begins to set up
a heavy machine gun.</p>
<p><strong>172 continued: 172</strong>: Tuvia POPS UP behind them,
spraying them with his submachine gun. He then turns the heavy machine
gun on the infantry advancing behind the tank – to devastating effect.
But now, the tank turns its attention to Tuvia. Its machine gun begins
to chew up the forest, forcing Tuvia to take cover. Without pausing to
think, Malbin grabs a grenade from the satchel and races toward the
tank. It falls pitifully short, exploding harmlessly as Malbin is cut
down.</p>
<p><strong>173 tuvia is now isolated and pinned down 173</strong>:
Bullets tear chunks out of trees as he tries to take cover.</p>
<p><strong>the turret swivels in his direction</strong>: It is only a
matter of moments before he is dead.</p>
<p><strong>when suddenly from out of the woods</strong>: Zus and the
rest of Jewish fighters emerge, firing on the run. Without regard for
his own life, Zus charges. The German infantry is caught in a cross-fire
as the Bielski brigade climbs out the river, firing wildly. Zus guns
down the tank commander manning the machine gun from the open hatch.
Jumps onto the tank and DROPS A GRENADE inside. An EXPLOSION of BLACK
SMOKE BILLOWS. Zus stands up amid the billowing smoke. He sees Tuvia who
is staring back at him.</p>
<p><strong>174 both groups meet - the destroyed tank smolders nearby
174</strong>: Asael is the first to reach Tuvia, who is carrying the
German assault machine gun.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Only weapons and ammunition! Spread the word.
Tuvia hands him the machine gun.</p>
<p><strong>asael</strong>: Anything else? Tuvia looks at him. Is he
fucking with him? Just a little.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Go on. Lilka is carrying a small child.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Lilka, please help. We’ve got to get the
injured into the forest.</p>
<p><strong>lilka</strong>: What about the dead?</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Everybody gather your things! We have to get
out of the open! Nearby, Aron removes the machine from the tank and
hands it to Zus. Bella approaches. Zus embraces her. Tuvia seizes one of
the German rifles. He yells to Shulman.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Shulman! Weapons only! Tell them.</p>
<p><strong>174 continued: 174</strong>: Shulman follows Tuvia’s
order.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: You’ve been promoted. Congratulations! Tuvia
turns, sees Bella with Zus. They see him. Zus hands Bella the machine
gun from the tank and approaches.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Where is the rest of your unit?</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Good question.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: You are going back?</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: No. They look at each other. So much unsaid. No
time to say it.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: We’ve got to build a new camp. Zus nods.</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: Perhaps you have room for one more?</p>
<p><strong>174 continued: 174</strong>: Tuvia reaches out his arms and
they embrace fiercely.</p>
<p><strong>175 in the deep woods - later 175</strong>: They walk in
silence. Lilka comes to walk beside him, resting her head on his
shoulder as they walk. Tuvia looks up at the shafts of light slanting
through the towering trees, as if allowing himself to appreciate its
beauty for the first time. Suddenly, he stops, listening, puzzled.</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Don’t you hear it?</p>
<p><strong>zus</strong>: What…?</p>
<p><strong>tuvia</strong>: Nothing. Isn’t it beautiful? We HOLD on
Tuvia. He has aged ten years in one.</p>
<p><strong>175 continued: 175</strong>: But for now he allows himself a
brief moment of satisfaction. We might even see the ghost of a smile.
But it is short- lived as Asael appears by his side and we see concern
once again clouding his face. Another problem to attend to. And as THE
CAMERA BEGINS TO PULL AWAY he is already hurrying to catch up with the
others. As they all disappear from sight into the sheltering darkness of
the woods, these words appear on screen:</p>
<p><strong>176 the opening scene - new york city - 1982 176</strong>:
Park Avenue. Traffic. More words on screen:</p>
<p><strong>zus and tuvia emigrated to the united states.</strong>: In
the taxi, THE ELDERLY MAN thrusts his hand through the slot in the
Plexiglas window separating him from the driver.</p>
<p><strong>elderly man</strong>: Here is money. I can get more. So much
more. Take it, please.</p>
<p><strong>cab driver</strong>: No, no… Indeed, when the CABBIE speaks,
though the voice is older and somewhat frail, we recognize it as
Tuvia’s.</p>
<p><strong>elderly man</strong>: What else can I give you, do for
you?</p>
<p><strong>aged tuvia</strong>: Nothing, it isn’t necessary. Tears
stream down the elderly man’s cheeks.</p>
<p><strong>elderly man</strong>: We are alive because of you. My
children. His children. So many. .Thousands.</p>
<p><strong>176 continued: 176</strong>: Behind them, HORNS are HONKING.
This is New York City.</p>
<p><strong>aged tuvia</strong>: Please, the traffic…</p>
<p><strong>elderly man</strong>: Bless you, Tuvia Bielski. May the Lord
bless you and keep you all the days of your life.</p>
<p><strong>middle-aged son</strong>: Papa, who was that man? The Elderly
Man watches the cab pull away, wiping his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>elderly man</strong>: That wasn’t a man. That was an angel.
As the cab pulls away, the CAMERA CRANES UP until it is lost in an
anonymous sea of traffic. These words appear on</p>
