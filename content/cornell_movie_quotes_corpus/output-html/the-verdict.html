<p><strong>funeral director</strong>: Mrs. Dee, this is Frank Galvin – a
very good friend of ours, and a very fine attorney.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: It’s a shame about your husband,
Mrs. Dee.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: I knew him vaguely through the Lodge. He was
a wonderful man. It was a crime what happened to him. A crime. If
there’s anything that I could do to help…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: he is usurping her</p>
<p><strong>son</strong>: What is that…?</p>
<p><strong>son</strong>: What the hell is that…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: …I was a friend of your fa…</p>
<p><strong>son</strong>: You never knew my father. You get out of here,
who the hell do you think you are…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: I’m talking to this man…</p>
<p><strong>funeral manager</strong>: Excuse me, Mrs. Cleary…</p>
<p><strong>son</strong>: Who the hell do you think you are?</p>
<p><strong>funeral manager</strong>: I don’t want you coming back here.
Ever. Do you understand?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: I was just talking to…</p>
<p><strong>funeral manager</strong>: Those are bereaved people in
there.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Pat says, ‘Mike… there’s a new bar, you go
in, for a half a buck you get a beer, a free lunch, and then take you in
the back room and they get you laid.’</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Another, Frank…?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: …everybody. Mike says, ‘Pat, you mean to
tell me for a buck you get a free lunch and a beer, and then you go in
the back and get laid?’ ‘That’s correct.’ Mike says, ‘Pat. Have you been
in this bar ?’ Pat says, ‘No, but my sister has…’ Everyone. Buy yourself
one too.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Get up. Get up.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Hi, Mickey…</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: What the hell do you think you’re doing…?
What’s going on here…?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Uh…</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Fuck you. I got a call today from Sally
Doneghy…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: …now who is that…?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: …You’re ’sposed to be in court in ten days
and she’s telling me you haven’t even met with them…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Sally Doneghy, now who is that?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: One lousy letter eighteen months ago… I try
to throw a fuckin’ case your way…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: …hey, I don’t need your charity…</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: …I get these people to trust you – they’re
coming here tomorrow by the way – I get this expert doctor to talk to
you. I’m doing all your fuckin’ legwork – and it’s eighteen months.
You’re ’sposed to be in court. I bet you haven’t even seen the file.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Hey, what are you, my nanny?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Listen to me. Listen to me… listen to me,
Frank, ‘cause I’m done fuckin’ with you. I can’t do it any more. Look
around you: You think that you’re going to change? What’s going to
change it? You think it’s going to be different next month? It’s going
to be the same. And I have to stop. This is it. I got you a good case,
it’s a moneymaker. You do it right and it will take care of you. But I’m
through. I’m sorry, Frank, this is the end. Life is too short, and I’m
too old.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: I’m… Mrs. Doneghy? I’m Frank Galvin… why
didn’t you go in?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: It’s locked.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: It’s locked?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: I’m terribly sorry… I hope we didn’t put you
out. Won’t you come in…? I’d offer you some coffee, but it looks like my
girl just went out.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: It’s not a good case. It’s a very good
case.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: A healthy young woman goes into the hospital
to deliver her third child, she’s given the wrong anesthetic…</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: …we, we love her, Dick and me…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: …I’m sure you do…</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: But what can we do? She don’t know who’s
visiting her…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: …I know. I went…</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: …You saw her?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Yes. Yes, I have.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: You know how beautiful she was? Her husband
left her, and he took her kids… They, they, they’d let you die in there.
They don’t care. Nobody cares. The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care… in
Arlington…? They’d take her in. Perpetual care. They’d take her. Fifty
thousand dollars they want. An endowment.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: …fifty thousand dollars?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I don’t want to leave her. Dick… the, the…
and Father Laughlin, he said that it was God’s will…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: …I understand…</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: My doctor told me that I got to move out
West… that’s when we filed in court. We didn’t want to sue…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: …I understand…</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: …But Dick, he’s looking for two years in
Tucson… and they called him up and said to come out. He’s a good man.
He’s only trying to do what’s right.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: This is my husband.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Please sit down. I told your wife. I’m sorry
that we have to meet out here. I’ve got a case coming in two days in the
Superior Court and my office is a mess of papers.</p>
<p><strong>doneghy</strong>: …that’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: I was telling your wife, we have a very good
case here.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: He saw her at the Northern Care…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: …and I have inquiries out to doctors,
experts in the field… there is, of course, a problem getting a doctor to
testify that another doctor’s negligent…</p>
<p><strong>doneghy</strong>: …the Archdiocese called up, they said who
was our attorney, ’cause the case is coming to trial…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: I doubt we’ll have to go to trial…</p>
<p><strong>doneghy</strong>: …we told them we didn’t want it to come out
this way.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: I completely understand…</p>
<p><strong>doneghy</strong>: We just…</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: We just can’t do it anymore. This is our
chance to get away.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: I’m going to see you get that chance.</p>
<p><strong>doneghy</strong>: What is this going to cost?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: It’s completely done on a contingency basis.
That means whatever the settlement is I retain one-third… that is, of
course, the usual arrangement…</p>
<p><strong>alito</strong>: His name is Frank Galvin. B.U. Law, class of
‘fifty-two. Second in his class. Editor of the Law Review. Worked with
Mickey Morrissey twelve years. Criminal Law and Personal Injury…’</p>
<p><strong>alito</strong>: ‘Married Patricia Harrington, nineteen
sixty…’</p>
<p><strong>alito</strong>: ‘Joined Stearns, Harrington, Pierce nineteen
sixty as a full partner. Resigned the firm nineteen sixt-ynine over the
Lillibridge case…’ Do you…?</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: He was accused of jury tampering.</p>
<p><strong>alito</strong>: Accused. Not indicted. He resigned the firm.
Divorced nineteen seventy. Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until
Morrissey retired in ’seventy- eight. Since then he’s been on his own.
Four cases before the Circuit Court. He lost them all. He drinks.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Four cases in three years…</p>
<p><strong>alito</strong>: The man’s an ambulance chaser…</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: …tell me about this case.</p>
<p><strong>alito</strong>: This is a nuisance suit. He’s looking for
small change. He’s asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don’t
want to go to court.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: No – we don’t want this case in court.</p>
<p><strong>alito</strong>: Neither does he. That’s where he loses. This
man’s scared to death to go to court. We only have to call his
bluff.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: I want to settle this thing and be done with
it. I don’t want the Archdiocese exposed.</p>
<p><strong>alito</strong>: No. Absolutely, and we’re going to see that
it is not.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: So what I want to do is stop it here. I’m
going to make him an offer. I want to do it myself. I want it to come
from me.</p>
<p><strong>alito</strong>: All right. But let’s keep the price down.
I’ve called Ed Concannon. He recommends that we continue to respond as
if we’re going to trial.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: If we were to go to trial, would we win the
case?</p>
<p><strong>alito</strong>: Well, of course, it’s always dangerous…</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: I know that answer. If we went to trial
would we win?</p>
<p><strong>alito</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Mickey told me to come back to work.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: …here’s your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: …yes. Get her on the phone…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: …that was a Dr. David Gruber’s office…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Gruber…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Mickey told him to call. ‘He’s some very
hotshot surgeon at Mass. Commonwealth. He wants to meet with you at
seven tonight re testimony in the case of Deborah Ann Kaye. You meet him
at the hospital.’</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: …he wants to testify…?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: It looks that way.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: You know what that would mean?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: To get somebody from a Boston hospital to
say he’ll testify?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: …a Mrs. Doneghy called… I told you that.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: This is going to drive the ante up.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Frank Galvin’s… who’s calling please? Bishop
Brophy’s office…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I’m sorry, he’s not in… may I take a mess…
tomorrow when, two o’clock… I’ll check my book…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Yes. Mr. Galvin’s clear at that time… the
Bishop’s office, tomorrow, the fifth at two p.m. Thank you…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: That’s the call that I’m waiting for.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: What does it mean?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: They want to settle. It means a lot of
money.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Does that mean I’m back for awhile?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Dr. Gruber…?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Dr. Gruber…</p>
<p><strong>gruber</strong>: Yes? Galvin, right?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: I appreciate – a man as busy as –</p>
<p><strong>gruber</strong>: That’s perfectly all right. I’m kind of
rushed. Do you mind if we walk while we talk?</p>
<p><strong>gruber</strong>: I read the hospital report on your
client.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: …Deborah Ann Kaye…</p>
<p><strong>gruber</strong>: …Deborah Ann Kaye…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: They called, they’re going to settle, what I
want to do is build up as much…</p>
<p><strong>gruber</strong>: Right. Who called?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: The Archdiocese called, they want to settle…
her estate…</p>
<p><strong>gruber</strong>: …and you’re going to do that?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>gruber</strong>: You’re going to settle out of court?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>gruber</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: question to him, as</p>
<p><strong>gruber</strong>: Her doctors killed her.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: I’m sorry…?</p>
<p><strong>gruber</strong>: Her doctors murdered her. They gave her the
wrong anesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life. Her doctors
murdered her.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Do you know who her doctors were?</p>
<p><strong>gruber</strong>: I read the file. Yeah. Marx and Towler. I
know who they were.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: The most respected…</p>
<p><strong>gruber</strong>: Whose side are you arguing…? I thought that
you wanted to do something. I don’t have any interest in the woman’s
‘estate’ – No offense, but we all know where the money’s going to… I
have an interest in the Hospital; and I don’t want those bozos working
in the same shop as me. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. They turned
the girl into a vegetable. They killed her and they killed her kid. You
caught ’em. Now: how many others did they kill?</p>
<p><strong>gruber</strong>: You want a cigar?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: The hospital is owned by the Archdioceses
of…</p>
<p><strong>gruber</strong>: What are they going to do? Not invite me to
their Birthday party…? Look, I gotta go. I have to be in Cambridge…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Well, well, when can we meet again.</p>
<p><strong>gruber</strong>: Okay. I’ll meet you here. Tuesday night… I
gotta go. You going my way?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: We have to… we… we have to keep you under
wraps. Please don’t, don’t discuss…</p>
<p><strong>gruber</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: …the case with anyone. And I’ll meet you
Tuesday, and we’ll go over your testimony…</p>
<p><strong>gruber</strong>: Right. Seven o’clock. Here.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Thank you…</p>
<p><strong>gruber</strong>: …that’s perfectly all right.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Uh, why, why are you doing this?</p>
<p><strong>gruber</strong>: To do right. Isn’t that why you’re doing
it?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: I want to buy you a drink.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Thanks, Franky.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Would you like a drink?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: I’d like an apartment.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Settle for a drink?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: No. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: I had a very good day today.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: drink, gets up off</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: You’re very welcome.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Well, well, well. Huh?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: It’s a long road that has no turning.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: That’s for sure, Frank.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: I’m going to the Archdiocese tomorrow at
two. I know you don’t. I know you don’t… no, you’re just following your
life. You have a life too… you have to move out West. It doesn’t help
you to stay here. Well… I’m sure she knows you care for her.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Well. Well. Well. Finally we’re none of us
protected… we… we just have to go on. To seek help where we can… and go
on… I know that you love her… I know you’re acting out of love.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: As soon as I know… you give him my respects
too. Not at all. Not at all… Good night. Well, bless you, too. Good
night.</p>
<p><strong>irish nurse #1</strong>: Jimmy, I said, don’t you go in your
pocket if there’s nothing there…</p>
<p><strong>irish nurse #2</strong>: …and what did he say…?</p>
<p><strong>irish nurse #1</strong>: …Sir, you aren’t allowed to be in
here…</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: You can’t be in here.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: I’m her attorney.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: It’s a question of continuing values.
St. Catherine’s – to do the good that she must do in the community has
to maintain the position that she holds in the community. So we have a
question of balance. On the one hand, the reputation, and, so, the
effectiveness of our hospital, and two of her important doctors – and,
on the other hand, the rights of your client.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: A young woman. In her prime… deprived of…
…life… sight… her family… It’s tragic. It’s a tragic accident.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: …nothing, of course, can begin to make it
right. But we must do what we can. We must do all that we can.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Yes. We must try to make it right.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: It’s a generous offer, Mr. Galvin… …nothing
can make the woman well… but we try to compensate… to make a
gesture…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: How did you settle on the amount?</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: We thought it was just.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: You thought it was just.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Because it struck me how neatly ‘three’ went
into the amount. Two Hundred Ten Thousand. That would mean I keep
seventy.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: That was our insurance company’s
recommendation.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Yes. It would be.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Nothing that we can do can make that woman
well.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: And no one will know the truth.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: What is the truth?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: That that poor girl put her trust in the
hands of two men who took her life, she’s in a coma, her life is gone.
She has no family, she has no home, she’s tied to a machine, she has no
friends – and the people who should care for her: her Doctors, and you,
and me, have been bought off to look the other way. We have been paid to
look the other way. I came in here to take your money. I brought
snapshots to show you. So I could get your money. I can’t take it. If I
take it. If I take that money I’m lost. I’m just going to be a rich
ambulance chaser. I can’t do it. I can’t take it.</p>
<p><strong>young priest</strong>: If we may discuss money, Mr. Galvin.
How is your law practice?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: It’s not too good. I’ve only got one
client.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: I have to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Come on. Let’s get a drink.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Don’t touch anything.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Are you out of your mind…?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: …I’m going to need your help…</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: You need my help…? You need a goddamn
keeper… are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred-ten grand?
Huh…? Are you nuts? Eh? Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring
her back to life?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: I’m going to help her.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: To do what…? To do what, for chrissake…? To
help her to do what? She’s dead…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: They killed her. And they’re trying to buy
it…</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: That’s the point, you stupid fuck. Let them
buy it. We let them buy the case. That’s what I took it for. You let
this drop – we’ll go up to New Hampshire, kill some fuckin’ deer…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Mick. Mick. Mick…</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: You – Listen: you said to me, ‘if not now,
when…’</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: I know what I said but not now. You won it.
Franky. You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you
won. We don’t want to go to court – is this getting to you…?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: …he’s a good man…</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: …he’s a good man…? He’s the Prince of
Fuckin’ Darkness… he’ll have people in there testifying that the broad
is well – they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis… don’t fuck
with this case.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: …I have to stand up for her…</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Frank, but not now. Frank. You’re trying to
wipe out some old business. But not now. I understand. But you go call
’em back. You call the Bishop back.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: I have to try this case. I have to do it,
Mick. I’ve got to stand up for that girl. I need your help. Mick, will
you help me…? Will you help me…?</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: Anybody ever hear, ‘For want of a shoe a
horse was lost?’ Who’s going on vacation tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: Friedman. St. Barts. is that right?</p>
<p><strong>friedman</strong>: Yessir.</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: notes at the side of laughter from the
room; to Friedman,</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: Our court date is January twelfth. You’re
all acquainted with this case. It’s been scheduled for eighteen months.
We have the attorney for the Plaintiff, Frank Galvin – and I trust you
are all familiar with his record – and we have been expecting him to
call us to negotiate. As he did not, and five days before we’re supposed
to go to court we made him a rather generous offer, which he refused.
Five days before the trial. What does this mean? I want to find out.
Acquaint yourselves again with the depositions. Don’t rely on the fact
that we did it last year. Do it again. We’re going to review them here,
and you do it at home. You each have a full file. Know the deps, and I
want you all to be here when we work with the defendants… when is that,
Billy…?</p>
<p><strong>young lawyer</strong>: Tuesday evening, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: I want an article in the Globe As Soon As
Possible, ‘St. Cat’s… Neighborhood Giant serving the community’ etc.
We’ve got it in the files. I want something in Monday’s Herald: ‘Our
Gallant Doctors,’ something… Be inventive, I want television… …talk to
our man at GBH. And to belabor the obvious for a moment… Our clients
are: the Archdiocese of Boston; St. Catherine Laboure Hospital, and Drs.
Marx and Towler, two of the most respected men in their profession. The
thrust of this defense will be to answer in court, in the press and in
the public mind – to answer the accusation of negligence this
completely: not only that we win the case, but that we win the case so
that it’s seen that the attack on these men and this institution was a
rank obscenity. All right. Let’s get the cobwebs off. Billy…?</p>
<p><strong>young lawyer</strong>: Please turn to your Page Four.</p>
<p><strong>young lawyer</strong>: We’re going to start with a review of
the depositions of the Operating Room Team: the nurse-anesthetist, the
scrub-nurse, the…</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Who have we got?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: We’ve got her sister. Testifies she had a
meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the
point.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: You got the admittance form says patient ate
nine hours prior to admittance.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Admittance form is wrong.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Forget it. You can’t prove it. Sister’s
testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: I’ve got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart
condition means they gave her the wrong anesthetic anyway, plus she came
in complaining of stomach pains…</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: …Gruber’s not bad.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Not bad…? This guy’s Dr. Kildare, the jury’s
going to love him, Mick… And you calm down, all right? Their guy,
Towler’s, the author of the book, ‘Methodology and Practice,
Anesthesiology.’ …and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in
the operating room, the scrub-nurse… ‘All these guys are God. I saw them
walk on water…’ They had an obstetrical nurse in there. We got a
deposition from the obstetrical nurse?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: ‘Mary Rooney, forty-nine. Lives in
Arlington, still working at the hospital.’ Can you get out tomorrow? How
come she isn’t speaking up.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Okay now. Cases: Smith versus State of
Michigan.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Brindisi versus Electric Boat.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: You got a good memory, Franky.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: I had a good teacher. McLean versus Urban
Transport…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Jimmy? Bushmills. Lookit, do me a favor.
I’ll buy you a drink tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Yeah? And what are you going to do
tonight?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: I’m going to get laid.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Don’t leave your best work in the
sheets.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: D’you find an apartment?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Still looking.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: I changed my life today. What did you
do?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I changed my room at the Hotel.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: The TV didn’t work.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: What Hotel are you staying at?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: And what are you? A cop?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: I’m a lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: My ex-husband was a lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Really. How wonderful for you.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Yes. It was, actually.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Oh, actually it was. Then why’d you call it
off?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Who says I’m the one that called it off?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: A brick house says you divorced him. I’ll
put you on your honor. Bet you a hundred dollars against you join me for
dinner. And I’ll take your word for it. Now you tell me the truth.
Because you cannot lie to me. What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Laura.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: My name’s Frank. And furthermore, you came
back to see me tonight.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: What if it wasn’t you that I came back to
see?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: You just got lucky. D’you eat yet? Come
on.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Jesus, you are one beautiful woman.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: The weak, the weak have got to have somebody
to fight for them. Isn’t that the truth? You want another drink?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I think I will.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Jimmy! That’s why the court exists. The
court doesn’t exist to give them justice, eh? But to give them a chance
at justice.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: And are they going to get it?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: They might. Yes. That’s the point… is that
they might… you see, the jury wants to believe. They’re all cynics,
sure, because they want to believe. I have to go in there tomorrow to
find twelve people to hear this case. I’m going to see a hundred people
and pick twelve. And every one of them it’s written on their face, ‘This
is a sham. There is no justice…’ but in their heart they’re saying,
‘Maybe… maybe…’</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Maybe what?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Maybe I can do something right.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: And is that what you’re going to do? Is that
what you’re going to do…?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: That’s what I’m going to try to do.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: That’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: You’re late, Mr. Galvin.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Yessir. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Why is that?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: I was held up.</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: Ed Concannon.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Frank Galvin. We’ve met before.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Let’s do some business.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: They tell me that no bargain ever was
completed other than quickly when both parties really cared to make a
deal.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Now, have you boys tried to resolve your
little difficulty because that certainly would save the Commonwealth a
lot of time and bother.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: This is a complicated case, your Honor…</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: I’m sure it is, Frank: and let me tell you
something. If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you’re
going to make a jury understand it? See my point? Let’s talk a minute.
Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to
walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: My client can’t walk, your Honor.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: I know full well she can’t, Frank. You see
the Padre on your way out and he’ll punch your ticket. You follow me?
I’m trying to help you.</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: Your Honor, Bishop Brophy and the
Archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand
dollars.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Huh!</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: My doctors didn’t want a settlement at
any price. They wanted this cleared up in court. They want their
vindication. I agree with them. But for today the offer stands. Before
we begin the publicity of a trial. For today only. When I walk out that
door the offer is withdrawn. As long as you understand that. It’s got to
be that way.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: We are going to try the case.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: That’s it…? Come on, guys… life is too short…
You tell me if you’re playing ‘chicken,’ or you mean it. Frank: I don’t
think I’m talking out of school, but I just heard someone offer you two
hundred grand… and that’s a lot of money… and if I may say, you haven’t
got the best of records.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: …things change.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: …that’s true. Sometimes they change,
sometimes they don’t. Now, I remember back to when you were
disbarred…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: I wasn’t disbarred, they dropped the
pro…</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: And it seems to me, a fella’s trying to come
back, he’d take this settlement, and get a record for himself. I myself
would take it and run like a thief.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: I’m sure you would.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Hm. We have the date set? Next Thursday.
Good. See you boys in court.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Mr. Abraham…</p>
<p><strong>abrams</strong>: Abrams…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Abrams. Yes. How are you today?</p>
<p><strong>abrams</strong>: I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Good. You ever been inside a hospital?</p>
<p><strong>abrams</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Ah. How did they treat you?</p>
<p><strong>abrams</strong>: I don’t know what you mean.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Been a long time, huh…?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: I’m getting it back. Don’t worry about me,
Mick. I’m fine. D’you find the obstetric nurse?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Mary Rooney. She won’t talk to me. I tried
her at the hospital. I’m going to try her back at home. Read this.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: So what?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: So what…? The best is yet to come. Check the
TV Guide. They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: ‘The
Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.’</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: They still have to take it to a jury.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: What I’m saying, they’re getting some
help.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: So what do you want me to do? Concannon’s
going to try the case his way, I’m going to try it mine. You want me to
go wee wee wee all the time because he’s got some flack, got stories in
the newspaper. I’m going to win this case.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: John: gimme a cuesta-ray.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Oh shit, what’s today?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Today is Tuesday. What?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: I’ve got to go see Gruber. What’s the best
cigars you have?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Give ’em a box of Macanudos.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Mickey: I’m supposed to meet somebody at
O’Rourke’s, I can’t make it.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Here you are, Franky.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Thanks. Can you go over and meet her…? Tell
her I’ll stop by when I’m through… Laura Fischer…</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Sure. Who is she?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That’s thirty-three bucks. Can you believe
that…?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Oh, yeah. Your broad from last night.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Thanks, Franky.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Tell her that I’ll meet her there, okay? See
you tomorrow in the office.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: We’re doing fine.</p>
<p><strong>doneghy</strong>: You said you’re gonna call me up. You
didn’t call me up. Who do you think you are? Who do you think you
are…?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Hold on a second.</p>
<p><strong>doneghy</strong>: I’m going to have you disbarred. I’m going
to have your ticket. You know what you did? Do you know what you
did?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: It’s all right, Mickey.</p>
<p><strong>doneghy</strong>: You ruined my life, Mister… Me and my wife…
and I am going to ruin yours… You don’t have to go out there to see that
girl. We been going four years. Four years… my wife’s been crying
herself to sleep what they, what, what they did to her sister.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: I swear to you I wouldn’t have turned the
offer down unless I thought that I could win the case…</p>
<p><strong>doneghy</strong>: What you thought!? What you thought… I’m a
workingman, I’m trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we’re
paying you, I got to find out from the other side they offered two
hundred…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: I’m going to win this case… Mist…
Mr. Doneghy… I’m going to the Jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as
an expert witness, and I’m going to win eight hundred thousand
dollars.</p>
<p><strong>doneghy</strong>: You guys, you guys, you’re all the same.
The Doctors at the hospital, you… it’s ‘What I’m going to do for you’;
but you screw up it’s ‘We did the best that we could. I’m dreadfully
sorry…’ And people like me live with your mistakes the rest of our
lives.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: If I could accept the offer right now, I
would. They took it back.</p>
<p><strong>doneghy</strong>: I understand. I went to the Bar
Association. They tell me you’re going to be disbarred.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Franky can’t make it. He had an appointment
he forgot, he’s going to see you later. I’m Mickey Morrissey, we’re
supposed to get to know each other.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: How’m I doing so far?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: So far you’re great. You got a
cigarette?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: What are you drinking? Jimmy…?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Dr. Gruber.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Dr. Gruber’s not here today, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: No… No…</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Yes, Sir. He hasn’t been in all day… He’s not
on the chart…</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Dr. Gruber.</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: Dr. Gruber’s not in.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: I had an appointment at his office, I think
I must have got it wrong. We had a meeting…</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: He’s not in, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: I… please. My wife… my wife’s prescription
has run out. If I can call him…</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: Dr. Halpern’s taking all his…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: No, no, no. I have to talk to him. If I can
only call him…</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: He’s… you can’t reach him, Sir. He’s in the,
on some island in the Caribbean, they don’t have a phone. He’ll be back
in a week… If you’d like Dr. Halpern’s number…</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Stearns, Harrington, you know who that
is?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Should I?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: A huge law firm. Okay? They put him in the
firm, he’s married, everything’s superb. Franky, he’s starting to talk
like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin’ place, ‘You must drop by
with Pat and me…’ Okay…?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: …and he’s making a billion dollars every
minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and
everything is rosy. Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: The Big Boy did…?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: That Frank was working on. Yeah. He thought
Franky needed some help, so they bribed a juror. So Franky finds out. He
comes to me in tears. He thinks that anybody who knows what a
‘spinnaker’ is got to be a saint. I told him ‘Franky, wake up. These
people are sharks. What do you think they got so rich from? Doing good?’
He can’t be comforted. He tells the boys at Stearns and Harrington
they’ve disappointed him, he’s going to the Judge to rat them out.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Huh.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Before he can get there here comes this
Federal Marshal, and Franky’s indicted for Jury tampering, they throw
him in jail, he’s gonna be disbarred, his life is over. Jimmy, gimme
another drink. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Me, too.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Okay. Now, so he’s in jail. He, finally, he
gets to see the light, he calls up Harrington, he says he thinks he made
a mistake. As if by magic, charges against him are dropped, he’s
released from jail. P.S. He’s fired from the firm, his wife divorces
him, he turns to drink and mopes around three and a half years. You like
that story?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Thank you for seeing me.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: That’s perfectly all right.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: I need an extension for my case.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: You should have taken their offer. Especially
if you were unprepared.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: I had a witness disappear on me.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: That happens.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: I could subpoena him if I had a week.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: I don’t have a week. This case never should
have come to trial. You know better. You’re Mr. Independent. You want to
be independent? Be independent now. I’ve got no sympathy for you.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Continental Casualty…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Mr. Alito, please.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Business hours are over, Sir. This is the
switch…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: I have to reach him. This is an emergency.
Could you give me his home number?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I’m sorry, Sir, we’re not allowed…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: …Would you, would you call him up. I’ll give
you my number, and ask him…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I can’t guarantee that…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: I understand. Thank you, my name is Galvin.
I’ll be at the following number in a half an hour. It’s urgent.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Hello. Yes. Thank you for calling. Frank
Galvin… I’m representing Deborah Ann Kaye…? I’d like to discuss your
firm’s offer of the two hundred th… In the sense that I feel that we’d
like to accept it. Well, it’s rather a shock to me, too; but it’s my
client’s wishes… She’s changed her mind as of this evening… I must say
that I tried to dissuade her…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: …Well, she, on the eve of the case… You
understand… I think quite frankly she’s come down with nerves and she’d
like…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: When was that arrived at…? I, I know what
Mr. Concannon said, but… I… Well, I think you’re making a mistake… I
think that you should reconsider; why don’t you check with your
principals, and I’ll call you in the… No?… you… uh. All right.
No. That’s fine. I understand. Sorry to bother you at home.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: What happened…?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: What happened, Joey…?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: I can’t talk now.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: D’you meet with Dr. Gruber…?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Concannon got to my witness. I can’t breathe
in here… Hello Doctor…? Dr. Thompson. This is Joseph Galvin, attorney
for a Deborah Ann Kaye, we had some correspondence some time ago…?
That’s right. I’m sorry that we never got back, the case was postponed,
and I’ve had a changeover in staff… I’m sorry to call you so late…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: …but we have had a change of strategy, and
we were wondering, I know this is short notice, but…</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Would you like me to leave…? Is this a bad
time – ?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: What…?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Is this a bad time.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: We, we… No… we just had a small reversal in
the case… I have some, uh… I have some work to do…</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: What happened…?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: They, uh, they got to my witness.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: …and is that serious?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: I’ve got to work…</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Do you want me to go…?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: No, no, I’m just…</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Why don’t you get some rest?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: I’ve got to work.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: You can’t work if you can’t think. You get in
bed. It’s all right. I’ll stay here with you. It’s all right. Come
on…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: You’re going to stay here…?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: I’m only going to rest a little while.</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: What is your name, please?</p>
<p><strong>towler</strong>: Dr. Robert Towler.</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: You were Deborah Ann Kaye’s doctor…?</p>
<p><strong>dr. towler</strong>: No, actually, she was referred to me.
She was Dr. Hagman’s patient…</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: Don’t equivocate. Be positive. Just tell
the truth.</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: Whatever the ‘truth’ is, let’s hear that.
You were her doctor.</p>
<p><strong>dr. towler</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: Say it.</p>
<p><strong>dr. towler</strong>: I was her doctor.</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: You were the anesthesiologist at her
delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy…</p>
<p><strong>dr. towler</strong>: …I was one of a group of…</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: Answer affirmatively. Simply. Keep those
answers to three words. You weren’t ‘part of a group,’ you were her
anesthesiologist. Isn’t that right?</p>
<p><strong>dr. towler</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver
her baby. Were you not?</p>
<p><strong>dr. towler</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: Anything special about the case?</p>
<p><strong>dr. towler</strong>: When she…</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: When ‘Debby’… Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>dr. towler</strong>: Thank you. When Debby…</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room
with you?</p>
<p><strong>dr. towler</strong>: Ms. Nevins, nurse-anesthetist; Dr. Marx,
of course…</p>
<p><strong>dr. towler</strong>: Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse…</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: What did these people do when her heart
stopped?</p>
<p><strong>dr. towler</strong>: We went to Code Blue…</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: ‘Code Blue,’ what does that mean…?</p>
<p><strong>dr. towler</strong>: It’s a common medical expression, it’s a
crash program to restore the heartbeat. Dr. Marx cut an airway in her
trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby… Ms. Nevins…</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: Why wasn’t she getting oxygen…?</p>
<p><strong>dr. towler</strong>: Well, many reasons, actually…</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: Tell me one?</p>
<p><strong>dr. towler</strong>: She’d aspirated vomitus into her
mask…</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: She THREW UP IN HER MASK. Let’s cut the
bullshit. Say it: She THREW UP</p>
<p><strong>dr. towler</strong>: She threw up in her mask.</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: …and her heart stopped and she wasn’t
getting oxygen.</p>
<p><strong>dr. towler</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: And what did your team do…</p>
<p><strong>dr. towler</strong>: Well, we…</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: …You brought thirty years of medical
experience to bear. Isn’t that what you did?</p>
<p><strong>dr. towler</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: …A patient riddled with complications,
questionable information on her, on her admitting form…</p>
<p><strong>dr. towler</strong>: …We did everything we could…</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: …to save her and to save the baby. Is
that…</p>
<p><strong>dr. towler</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: You reached down into death. Now, isn’t
that right?</p>
<p><strong>dr. towler</strong>: My God, we tried to save her… You can’t
know… You can’t know…</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: Tell us.</p>
<p><strong>dr. thompson</strong>: Mr. Galvin?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Dr. Thompson…?</p>
<p><strong>dr. thompson</strong>: It was good of you to meet…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Thank you for coming.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: I have some errands to run, and then I
thought we’d spend the evening…</p>
<p><strong>dr. thompson</strong>: That’s what I’d planned to…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: I’m going to take you to the home to see the
girl…</p>
<p><strong>dr. thompson</strong>: referring to his</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Yes. Yes. I think so. I hope you’ll be
comfortable. I’m putting you up at my…</p>
<p><strong>dr. thompson</strong>: …I made a reservation at…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: …apartment. No, no. Please. You don’t know
who we’re dealing with, I, please believe me, they…</p>
<p><strong>dr. thompson</strong>: …What difference would…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: These people play very rough. They don’t
want to lose this case. There’s a lot of pressure they can bring to
bear, I…</p>
<p><strong>dr. thompson</strong>: There’s nothing they can do to me.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Please, Sir. Please. Humor me.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: We’ll spend the evening together, I’ll put
you up, you’ll be very comfortable. Please. That’s my address. The key
is in it. 1225 Commonwealth. Treat the place as your own. Please don’t
tell anyone you’re here, I’ll see you this evening. Thank you, and thank
you for coming.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Mr. Galvin’s…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Let me talk to Mickey.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Yeah? How’s our new witness?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: D’you find the obstetric nurse?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: She’s workin’ the late shift at the
Hospital. She’s at home now, I’m going over there to talk to…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Gimme the address. I’m gonna go. We’re going
to need her.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: I’m Joe Galvin, I’m representing Deborah Ann
Kaye, case against St. Catherine Laboure.</p>
<p><strong>mary rooney</strong>: I told the guy I didn’t want to talk
to…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: I’ll just take a minute. Deborah Ann Kaye.
You know what I’m talking about. The case is going to trial. Our chief
witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?</p>
<p><strong>mary rooney</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: He’s the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology,
Massachusetts Commonwealth. He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put
my girl in the hospital for life. And we can prove that. What we don’t
know is why. What went on in there? In the O.R. That’s what we’d like to
know. Something went wrong. And you know what it was. They gave her the
wrong anesthetic. What happened? The phone rang… someone got distracted…
what?</p>
<p><strong>mary rooney</strong>: …you got your doctor’s testimony. Why
do you need me?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: I want someone who was in the O.R. We’re
going to win the case, there’s no question of that. It’s just a matter
of how big…</p>
<p><strong>mary rooney</strong>: I’ve got nothing to say to you.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: You know what happened.</p>
<p><strong>mary rooney</strong>: Nothing happened.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Then why aren’t you testifying for their
side?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: I can subpoena you, you know. I can get you
up there on the stand.</p>
<p><strong>mary rooney</strong>: And ask me what?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Who put my client in the hospital for
life.</p>
<p><strong>mary rooney</strong>: I didn’t do it, Mister.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Who are you protecting, then?</p>
<p><strong>mary rooney</strong>: Who says that I’m protecting
anyone?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: I do. Who is it? The Doctors. What do you
owe them?</p>
<p><strong>mary rooney</strong>: I don’t owe them a goddamn thing.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Then why don’t you testify?</p>
<p><strong>mary rooney</strong>: You know, you’re pushy, fella…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: You think I’m pushy now, wait ’til I get you
on the stand…</p>
<p><strong>mary rooney</strong>: Well, maybe you better do that, then.
You know you guys are all the same. You don’t care who gets hurt. You’re
a bunch of whores. You’d do anything for a dollar. You got no loyalty…
no nothing… you’re a bunch of whores.</p>
<p><strong>young attorney</strong>: His name is Dr. Lionel Thompson.
City College of New York, Class of twenty-six. Bachelor of Science; New
York College of Medicine; sixteenth in a class of twenty-two. Nineteen
seventy-six got a courtesy appointment, staff of anesthesiology,
Easthampton Hospital for Women. Never married. Has no honors or degrees
of any weight. Since nineteen seventy- five he’s testified in
twenty-eight court cases, twelve malpractice. And he’s black.</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: I’m going to tell you how you handle the
fact that he’s black. You don’t touch it. You don’t mention it. You
treat him like anybody else. Neither better or worse. And you get a
black lawyer to sit at our table. Okay…?</p>
<p><strong>young attorney</strong>: Yessir.</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: Good. What else do you do?</p>
<p><strong>young attorney</strong>: …get the records of his testimony in
the twelve malpractice cases.</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: Do it. We’ll be at Locke-Obers.</p>
<p><strong>dr. thompson</strong>: They gave her the wrong
anesthetic.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Why is that?</p>
<p><strong>dr. thompson</strong>: Her sister said she ate one hour prior
to admittance… she…</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: …that’s what the sister said. The chart said
she ate nine hours prior to…</p>
<p><strong>dr. thompson</strong>: …she went in complaining of stomach
cramps. Good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Is that what a good doctor would do? How old
are you, please?</p>
<p><strong>dr. thompson</strong>: I am seventy-four years old.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: What qualifies you as an expert in
anesthetics?</p>
<p><strong>dr. thompson</strong>: I am on the staff of…</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me,
what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at
Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the
world, were trying to save a woman’s life. They were there, and here you
are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say…</p>
<p><strong>dr. thompson</strong>: …I made a detailed physical
examination of the patient, Sir, yesterday evening, I…</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: She getting good care over there?</p>
<p><strong>dr. thompson</strong>: Actually, yes. It’s by no means
bad,</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Then what good would it do to ruin the
reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life’s not going to be
changed in the least? You know what CODE BLUE means?</p>
<p><strong>dr. thompson</strong>: ‘Code Blue’…</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: It’s a common medical term.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: We’re going to lose.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Do you think it’s my fault?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Isn’t there something you…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: That’s not the question. It’s over. Do you
think that it’s my fault? If I’d… if I’d… I never should have taken it.
There was no way that I was going to win.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: You’re talking like a drunk.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: That’s what I am.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: And it’s over…?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Well, then what are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: I… do you want me to leave?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: You do what you want. You want to leave… You
want to go kill yourself?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: You want me to tell you it’s your fault? It
probably is. What are you going to do about it? I thought it’s not over
till the jury comes in.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Who told you that?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: You told me so. Maybe you’d get some
sympathy. You came to the wrong place.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: And what makes you so tough?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Maybe I’ll tell you later.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Is there going to be a later…?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Not if you don’t grow up…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: If I don’t ‘grow up…’</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: You’re like a kid, you’re coming in here like
it’s Saturday night, you want me to say that you’ve got a fever – you
don’t have to go to school…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: You, you don’t under…</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Oh, yes, I do, Joe. Believe me. You say
you’re going to lose. Is it my fault? Listen! The damned case doesn’t
start until tomorrow and already it’s over for you!</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: It’s over!</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: What is your wife’s picture doing by the side
of your…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: What is that to you…?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: What would you like it to be to me…? I, I, I
can’t invest in failure.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Excuse me, I’ve…</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Joe… Joe…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Stop pressuring me…</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: You’re pressuring yourself…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: No… no…</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Yes. We’ve all got to let go.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: I’m going to do the best I can for you and
your sister. I know what it means to you. Believe me… It means that much
to me.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: How are you holding up?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: I’m swell.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: And all we’ve got is a witch doctor!</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Look at it this way: it’s refreshing every
time a Doctor takes the stand he’s not a Jew.</p>
<p><strong>bailiff</strong>: Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye, all persons
having anything to do before the Honorable, the Justices of the Superior
Court now sitting at Boston within and for the County of Suffolk, draw
near, give your attendance and you shall be heard. God save the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Deborah Ann Kaye versus St. Catherine
Laboure, Robert S. Towler, M.D. and Sheldon F. Marx, M.D.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Is the Plaintiff ready?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Ready, your Honor.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Defense…?</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: Ready for the Defense, your Honor.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Let’s begin.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: It’s a terrible thing to sit in judgment. So
much rides on it. I know that you’ve thought, ‘How can I be pure. How
can I be impartial without being cold. How can I be merciful and still
be just?’ And I know that most of you have said some sort of prayer this
morning to be helped. To judge correctly. We have the reputation of two
men. Two well respected doctors and a renowned hospital before us. And
with those two respected men we have my client, Deborah Ann Kaye… …who
was deprived of sight, of locomotion, hearing, speech, of everything, in
short, which constitutes her life. We are going to prove she was
deprived through negligence. Through the negligence of those respected
men. We will show: One…</p>
<p><strong>alito</strong>: Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?</p>
<p><strong>young lawyer</strong>: She’s the only nurse who isn’t
testifying for the Doctors.</p>
<p><strong>alito</strong>: What did he find?</p>
<p><strong>young lawyer</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>alito</strong>: How good’s your intelligence?</p>
<p><strong>young lawyer</strong>: Very good.</p>
<p><strong>alito</strong>: And so what is the rest of his case aside
from Dr. Thompson?</p>
<p><strong>young lawyer</strong>: As far as we know, nothing.</p>
<p><strong>alito</strong>: Thank Mr. Concannon for me. Please tell him
I’ll see him at his office.</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: Dr. Thompson, just so the Jury knows, you
never treated Deborah Ann Kaye. Is that correct?</p>
<p><strong>dr. thompson</strong>: That is correct. I was engaged to
render an opinion.</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: Engaged to render an opinion. For a
price. Is that correct? You’re being paid to be here today?</p>
<p><strong>dr. thompson</strong>: Just as you are, Sir…</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: Are you board-certified in
anesthesiology, Doctor?</p>
<p><strong>dr. thompson</strong>: No, I am not. It’s quite common in New
York State…</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: …I’m sure it is, but this is
Massachusetts, Doctor. Certified in Internal Medicine?</p>
<p><strong>dr. thompson</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: Neurology?</p>
<p><strong>dr. thompson</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: Orthopedics?</p>
<p><strong>dr. thompson</strong>: I’m just an M.D.</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: Do you know Dr. Robert Towler…?</p>
<p><strong>dr. thompson</strong>: I know of him.</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: How is that?</p>
<p><strong>dr. thompson</strong>: Through, through his book.</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: What book is that?</p>
<p><strong>dr. thompson</strong>: Meth… Methodology and Technique…</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: …of Anesthesiology?</p>
<p><strong>dr. thompson</strong>: ‘Methodology and Techniques of
Anesthesiology.’ Yes.</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: How old are you?</p>
<p><strong>dr. thompson</strong>: I am seventy-four years old.</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: Uh-huh. Still practice a lot of
medicine?</p>
<p><strong>dr. thompson</strong>: I’m on the staff of…</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: Yes, we’ve heard that. Doctor: you
testify quite a bit against other physicians? Isn’t that right? You,
you’re available for that? When you’re paid to be there?</p>
<p><strong>dr. thompson</strong>: Sir. Yes. When a thing is wrong… as in
this case, I am available. I am seventy-four years old, I am not
board-certified.</p>
<p><strong>dr. thompson</strong>: I have been practicing medicine for
forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done.</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: Do you, indeed. I’ll bet you do. Fine.
Fine. We’ll save the court the time. We will admit the Doctor as an
‘expert witness,’ fine.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Do we have time this morning to… All right.
Mr. Galvin, you want to continue now, or we can resume with Dr. Thompson
this afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Thank you, your Honor, I’ll continue.
Dr. Thompson. Did you examine Deborah Ann Kaye last night at The
Northern Chronic Care Facility?</p>
<p><strong>dr. thompson</strong>: I did.</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: Objection.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Sustained. Yes. The witness will confine his
testimony to review of the hospital records.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: I believe that’s the law… is it not,
Mr. Galvin…?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Dr. Thompson. From your review of the
hospital records of May twelfth nineteen seventy-six.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: In your opinion, what happened to Deborah
Ann Kaye?</p>
<p><strong>dr. thompson</strong>: Cardiac arrest. During delivery her
heart stopped. When the heart stops the brain’s deprived of oxygen. You
get brain damage. That is why she’s in the state she’s in today.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Now, Dr. Towler’s testified that they
restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes. In your opinion is
his estimate correct?</p>
<p><strong>dr. thompson</strong>: It’s my opinion it took him much
longer. Nine… ten minutes. There’s too much brain damage.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Are you saying that a failure to restore the
heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical
practice?</p>
<p><strong>dr. thompson</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Your Honor!</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Yes, Mr. Galvin?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: If I may be permitted to question my own
witness in my own way…</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: I’d just like to get to the point,
Mr. Galvin. Let’s not waste these people’s time. Answer the question,
Mr. Witness. Please. Would a nine minute lapse in restoring the
heartbeat in and of itself be negligence?</p>
<p><strong>dr. thompson</strong>: I… in that small context I would have…
I would have to say ‘no.’</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Then you’re saying there’s no negligence,
based on my question?</p>
<p><strong>dr. thompson</strong>: I… given the limits of your question,
that’s correct.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: The Doctors were not negligent.</p>
<p><strong>dr. thompson</strong>: I… um…</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: I’m not through with the witness, your
Honor. With all due respect if you are going to try my case for me I
would appreciate it if you wouldn’t lose it.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Thank you. I think that’s enough for this
morning. I’ll see the Plaintiff’s Counsel in my chambers. Now,
please.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: I got a letter from the Judge Advocate’s
office on you today, fella, you’re on your way out… They should have
kicked you out on that Lillibridge case. Now this is it today.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: I’m an attorney on trial before the bar.
Representing my client. My client, do you understand? You open your
mouth and you’re losing my case for me.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Listen to me, fella…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: No, no, you listen to me. All I wanted in
this case is an even shake. You rushed me into court in five days… my
star witness disappears, I can’t get a continuance, and I don’t give a
damn. I’m going up there and I’m going to try it. Let the Jury decide.
They told me Sweeney he’s a hard- ass, he’s a defendant’s judge. I don’t
care. I said, the hell with it. The hell with it. I’ll take my chances
he’ll be fair.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Galvin, look, many years ago…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: And don’t give me this shit, ‘I was a
lawyer, too.’ ’Cause I know who you were. You couldn’t hack it as a
lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are. I know who you
are.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Are you done?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Damn right I’m done. I’m going to ask for a
mistrial and I’m going to request that you disqualify yourself from
sitting on this case. I’m going to take a transcript to the State and
ask that they impeach your ass.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: You aren’t going to get a mistrial, boy.
We’re going back this afternoon, we’re going to try this case to an end.
Now you get out of here before I call the Bailiff and have you thrown in
jail.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: What does it mean? I… I mean we, you have
other tactics…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: We, yes. Yes. They, they present their side,
and I get the same chance. To cross-examine… to… to…</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Are we going to win? We have, you know, other
tactics, though…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: No further questions.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Dr. Towler…</p>
<p><strong>towler</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: You have a record of what happened in the
operating room…</p>
<p><strong>towler</strong>: Yes, that’s correct.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: …there are notations every thirty
seconds…</p>
<p><strong>towler</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: …of the procedures…</p>
<p><strong>towler</strong>: Yes, the roving nurse…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: But those notations stop… …Four-and-one-half
minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye’s…</p>
<p><strong>towler</strong>: We, we were rather busy…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Four-and-one-half minutes after her heart
stopped. And they resume seven minutes…</p>
<p><strong>towler</strong>: As I’ve said we had some more…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: …they start again three minutes earlier…</p>
<p><strong>towler</strong>: We had rather more important things on our
mind than taking notes. We were trying to restore her…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: What happened in those three…</p>
<p><strong>towler</strong>: …we were trying to restore her
heartbeat.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: What happened in those three minutes…?</p>
<p><strong>towler</strong>: We’d gone to ‘Code Blue,’ we were
administering electro…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Why did it take that long to get her
heartbeat…</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: Objection, we’ve…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: …to get her heartbeat back…?</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: We’ve touched on this, his own witness
has said…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: …almost nine minutes… causing brain
damage.</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: Your Honor…! Your Honor…</p>
<p><strong>towler</strong>: Brain damage could have been… it didn’t
necessarily take nine minutes, it could have been caused in two…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Wait, wait, wait, you’re saying that her
brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for
two minutes…?</p>
<p><strong>towler</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Huh. And why is that?</p>
<p><strong>towler</strong>: Because she was anemic. It’s right there on
her chart. Her brain was getting less oxygen anyway…</p>
<p><strong>dr. thompson</strong>: I didn’t do too well for you.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: No, you did fine.</p>
<p><strong>dr. thompson</strong>: I’m afraid that’s not true. Will you
want me to stay on till Monday?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: No. No thank you, Doctor. You go home.</p>
<p><strong>dr. thompson</strong>: You know… sometimes people can
surprise you. Sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the
truth.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Yes… I… yes.</p>
<p><strong>dr. thompson</strong>: You sure you don’t want me to stay
on.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: No. No. Thank you. You go home.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: I’m going back to the office.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Is it over?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: I don’t have a goddamned idea.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Okay. What do you do when you don’t have a
witness?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: You use their witness.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: I think we tried that. The case is over.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: And how the fuck… You broke the first law
that they taught you in law school. You never ask a question you don’t
know the answer to. Frankie, wake up. You got your own expert witness
says there was no negligence. It’s over. Period. There’ll be no other
cases…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: There are no other cases. This is the case.
Now you decide… Are you in or out…?</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: I know how you feel. I know you don’t
believe me, but I do. I’m going to tell you something I learned when I
was your age. I had prepared a case. Mr. White asked me, ‘How did you
do.’ I said, ‘I’ve done my best.’ He said, ‘They don’t pay you to do
your best. They pay you to win.’ That’s what pays for this office. And
that’s what pays for the pro bono work that we do for the poor. And for
the kind of law that you want to practice. And that’s what pays for your
clothes and my whiskey, and the leisure that we have to sit back and
discuss philosophy. As we’re doing tonight. We’re paid to win the
case.</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: You finished your marriage. You wanted to
come back and practice law. You wanted to come back to the world.</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: Welcome back.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Why doesn’t Mary Rooney testify?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Are you with me… are you awake…?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Yeah. I’m awake.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Rooney’s protecting someone. Who is she
protecting?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: The Doctors.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: She’s protecting the Doctors she’d be up
there on the stand…</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Read me what she said.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: ‘You guys are a bunch of whores… uh…
loyalty… you don’t care who gets hurt… you don’t have any loyalty…’</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: …one of the other nurses?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Who? They’re all testifying. Everybody who
was in the O.R.’s going to take the stand.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: All right. Who wasn’t in the O.R.?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: What difference can that make…? All
right…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Uh… the admitting nurse…</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: What did she do?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: She didn’t do anything. She took the
patient’s history and signed the charts. ‘K.C.’ ‘Kathy Costello…’</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: The ‘History’…?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: How old are you, how many children… when did
you last eat…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Miss Rooney. Oh. Listen. I understand what
you are doing. And I want you to know it’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>rooney</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: About Kathy Costello. I understand, and I
don’t blame you for shielding her.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: I spoke to her, and everything is all
right.</p>
<p><strong>rooney</strong>: I, what are you talking about? I talked to
her this morning, and she said…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: She told me.</p>
<p><strong>rooney</strong>: She did?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: I just saw her.</p>
<p><strong>rooney</strong>: In New York?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: What?</p>

Association?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: The broad has disappeared…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: The Hospital…?</p>

<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I have to talk to you.</p>

<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Sorry to bother you so late.</p>

nurse? I’m sorry. I think we have our records mixed up.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Are you related to Kathy Costello, the
R.N.?… I’m sorry…</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Hello, this is Dr. Dorchester in Boston.
This is an emergency. A nurse left my employ…</p>

<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Hello. This is Mr. Dorchester in Records.
We’re looking for Kathy Costello…</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: I need a cigarette! She left my office four
years ago, we’re looking for a chart… I need a cigarette…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Thank you. I’ll hold.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Hello. This is Ross Williams. I’m calling

<p><strong>female</strong>: Hello.</p>

<p><strong>voice</strong>: No. At Chelsea Childcare. Okay. Look, call me
Monday, hey? I’m late for work.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Hello? Mr. Gal… where are you…?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: You’re going to New York? I… you’re kidding…
Because I’m going to New York. I just got a call. I have to go sign
papers. About my divorce. I… good. Frank. We’ll meet there. All
right?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Can we meet there, Joe?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: You got a cigarette…?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: At the Beacon. On Fifty-third Street… we can
spend the night.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: At around four…?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I feel the same way, Joe… I’ll see you this
afternoon?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: You got any cigarettes?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Hi. How are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: I’ve been meaning to come in a long
time.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: You live in the neighborhood?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Uh-huh. My nephew’s going to be staying with
us in a few months, so I stopped by.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: How old is he?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Four. You’re great with these kids.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: You’re really… You, are you the one they
told me was the nurse?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Who told you that?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Mrs…</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Mrs. Simmonds.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: I used to be a nurse.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: That’s a wonderful profession. My
daughter-in-law’s a nurse. What did you do, stop?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: How come you stopped?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Will you help me?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: What the hell are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: We got to talk.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: What are you doing in New York…?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Come on, we’ll get a cup of coffee…</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: It’s all right… it’s all right… it’s all
right… it’s all right…</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: I talked to Johnnie White at the Bar
Association. The broad used to work for one of Concannon’s partners in
New York awhile ago. She wanted to move to Boston. How badly did she
hurt us, Joe?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: We got a mistrial, you know. Joe – did you
hear what I said…?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: I don’t want a mistrial.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: He’s not here. Yeah. I don’t know when. All
right.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: The Knicks are pressing hard…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Dr. Towler; page 406, ‘Contraindications to
general anesthetic. Ideally a patient should refrain from taking
nourishment up to nine hours prior to induction of general anesthetic.’
Does that sound familiar?</p>
<p><strong>dr. towler</strong>: Yes. I wrote it.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: ‘Practice and Methodology in Anaesthesia.’
General textbook on the subject. Is that correct?</p>
<p><strong>dr. towler</strong>: I. Yes. It is.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: And you wrote that…</p>
<p><strong>dr. towler</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: …Page 414, ‘If a patient has taken
nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anesthetic
should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient
will aspirate food particles into his mask.’ Is that what happened to
Deborah Ann Kaye? She aspirated into her mask?</p>
<p><strong>dr. towler</strong>: She threw up in her mask, yes. But she
hadn’t eaten one hour prior to admission.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: If she had eaten, say one hour prior to
admission, the inducement of a general anesthetic… the type you gave
her… would have been negligent…?</p>
<p><strong>dr. towler</strong>: Negligent. Yes… it would have been
criminal. But that was not the case.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Mr. Concannon…?</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: Nothing further, your Honor.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Mr. Galvin, rebuttal?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Katherine Price.</p>
<p><strong>bailiff</strong>: Katherine Price…</p>
<p><strong>bailiff</strong>: State your name please.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Katherine Lynn Price.</p>
<p><strong>bailiff</strong>: D’you swear that the evidence you are about
to give will be the truth, the…</p>
<p><strong>bailiff</strong>: …whole truth and nothing but the truth, so
help you God?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>bailiff</strong>: Be seated.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Kathy Price…</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: You were the Admitting Nurse at
St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the
night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted…</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: You signed this form?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: These are your initials, ‘K.C.’?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Kathy Costello. That’s my maiden name.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: D’you ask the patient when did she last
eat?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: What did she say?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: She said she had a full meal one hour before
coming to the hospital.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: One hour.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: And did you write the numeral ‘one’ down on
the record, standing for one hour?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: I did.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: A single hour.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Your witness.</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: You are aware of the penalties for
perjury…?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: It’s a crime.</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: Yes. It is a crime. A serious crime.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: I wouldn’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: You would not…?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: In fact, you’ve just taken an oath that
you would not commit perjury. You’ve just sworn to that. Isn’t that
right?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: Just now…</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: …sworn before God you would tell the
truth?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: Now. I’d like to ask you something: four
years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs.
Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart
that you signed…?</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: And wasn’t that an oath…? These are your
initials here: K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath. No less
important than that which you took today. Isn’t that right? Isn’t that
right…?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: I… yes.</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: Then, please, which is correct? You’ve
sworn today the patient ate one hour ago. Four years ago you swore she
ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie. When were you lying?</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: You know these doctors could have settled
out of court. They wanted a trial. They wanted to clear their names.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Objection!</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: And you would come here, and on a slip of
memory four years ago, you’d ruin their lives.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: They lied.</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: ‘They lied.’ Indeed! When did they lie?
And do you know what a lie is?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: I do. Yes.</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: You swore on this form that the patient
ate nine hours ago.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: That’s not my handwriting.</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: You’ve just said you signed it.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I
didn’t write that figure.</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: You didn’t write that figure. And how is
it that you remember that so clearly after four years?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Because I kept a copy. I have it right
here.</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: Objection! This is ri… expect us to
accept a photocopy, we have the original right…</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: I’ll rule on that presently. Proceed.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Please proceed.</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: …what in the world would induce you to
make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it four years? This is
a… why? Why would you do that?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: I thought I would need it.</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: And why, please tell us, would you think
that?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: After, after the operation, when that poor
girl, she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in. He told me he had
five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired, and he never looked
at the admittance form. And he told me to change the form. He told me to
change the one to a nine. Or else, or else, he said… He said he’d fire
me. He said I’d never work again… Who were these men…? Who were these
men…? I wanted to be a nurse…</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: No further questions.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: You may step down.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Mr. Galvin…?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Nothing further, your Honor…</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Mr. Concannon…?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Mr. Concannon.</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: Thank you, your Honor. We object to the
copy of the admissions form as incompetent and essentially hearsay
evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana, U.S. 131 point 2 and
216 through 25 of the Uniform Code: ‘The admission of a duplicate
document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the
possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed.’ And, your Honor,
having given the Plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this
issue now: we object to the admission of the Xerox form.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: …one moment, Mr. Concannon…</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: The document is disallowed, the jury will be
advised not to consider the testimony of Kathy Costello regarding the
Xerox form. It’s unsubstantiated and we can’t accept a copy in
preference to the original…</p>
<p><strong>concannon</strong>: Thank you, your Honor. Further:
Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a ‘Surprise Witness’ she may only
serve to rebut direct testimony. As her only evidentiary rebuttal was
the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire
testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally
disregard her appearance here.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: I’m going to uphold that.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: I object, your Honor…</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Overruled…</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: Exception!</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Noted. Thank you. Miss Costello was a
rebuttal witness. Her sole rebuttal was the document, which has been
disallowed…</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Her entire testimony must be stricken from
the record. You shouldn’t have heard it, but you did. Now, that was my
mistake… and you must strike it from your minds, give it no weight.</p>
<p><strong>alito</strong>: Legally it’s over. Concannon was
brilliant.</p>
<p><strong>brophy</strong>: Tell me about Kaitlin Costello.</p>
<p><strong>alito</strong>: There’s nothing to tell. It’s been stricken
from the record.</p>
<p><strong>brophy</strong>: I know. Did you believe her?</p>
<p><strong>judge sweeney</strong>: Mr. Galvin…?</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: You know, so much of the time we’re lost. We
say, ‘Please, God, tell us what is right. Tell us what’s true. There is
no justice. The rich win, the poor are powerless…’ We become tired of
hearing people lie. After a time we become dead. A little dead. We start
thinking of ourselves as victims. And we become victims. And we become
weak… and doubt ourselves, and doubt our institutions… and doubt our
beliefs… we say for example, ‘The law is a sham… there is no law… I was
a fool for having believed there was.’ But today you are the law. You
are the law… And not some book and not the lawyers, or the marble
statues and the trappings of the court… all that they are is symbols. Of
our desire to be just… All that they are, in effect, is a prayer… …a
fervent, and a frightened prayer.</p>
<p><strong>galvin</strong>: In my religion we say, ‘Act as if you had
faith, and faith will be given to you.’ If… If we would have faith in
justice, we must only believe in ourselves. And act with justice. And I
believe that there is justice in our hearts. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Have you reached a verdict?</p>
<p><strong>foreman</strong>: We have, your Honor.</p>
<p><strong>foreman</strong>: Your Honor, we have agreed to hold for the
Plaintiff… but on the size of the award, are we bound…</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: You are not bound by anything, other than
your good judgment, based on the evidence.</p>
<p><strong>foreman</strong>: Are we permitted to award an amount greater
than the amount the Plaintiff asked for?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Yes. You are.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Please retire and…</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: The jury might be out for awhile. You want
to run across the street and get a drink?</p>
