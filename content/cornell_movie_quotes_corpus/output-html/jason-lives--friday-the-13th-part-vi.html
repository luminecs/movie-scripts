<p><strong>hawes</strong>: I don’t know how the hell you talked me into
this, Jarvis.</p>
<p><strong>hawes</strong>: Hell, I must be crazy. If the old institution
ever found out about this…boy, they’d throw our butts back in an’
strait-jacket ’em permanent.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: This is between me and Jason.</p>
<p><strong>hawes</strong>: Yeah, I know. But I still don’t get the
therapy here. Jason’s dead, right? How will seeing his corpse stop your
hallucinations?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Seeing it won’t. But destroying him once and
for all will. Jason belongs in hell.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I’m gonna see he gets there.</p>
<p><strong>hawes</strong>: Hey, where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>hawes</strong>: What’s that for? Tommy, what are you doin’,
boy?!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You bastard!</p>
<p><strong>hawes</strong>: Oh, shit.</p>
<p><strong>hawes</strong>: Boy, he must’ve really messed you over.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Yeah. Fuck you, Jason.</p>
<p><strong>hawes</strong>: Let’s just get the hell out of here. My heart
can’t take any more of this.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Don’t shoot. Please.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: You in show business, kid? You sure know
how to make an entrance.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You gotta do something! Jason’s alive! He
killed my friend, now he’s coming for me!!</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Now you better cool out a minute, boy. You
already almost got your head blown to pieces.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Will you listen, dammit!</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Don’t piss me off, junior. Or I will
repaint this office with your brains.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Jason is alive. We dug up his body. I was
gonna cremate it and…</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Hold it. Whoa… What’s your name, son?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Tommy Jarvis. We gotta do something. He’s
even more powerful now that…</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Aren’t you the kid whose mother and friends
were….</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Yeah. Jason murdered them and…</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: And you’ve been at some psychiatric clinic
ever since, haven’t you?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Yes, but they released me because…</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: Rains stopped. Ya owe me that five-spot,
partner.</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: Sorry. I didn’t…</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: No problem, Rick. Come over and meet a
former resident here, Tommy Jarvis. He’s got some kinda prank going
about…</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: There’s no time for this bullshit…</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Jason’s got to be stopped.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Now that’s what know in the books as
screwin’ the pooch. Iron this punk.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: No… Ya gotta listen. Jason’s coming back
here. He’s after me. I tried to destroy him but I fucked up….</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: You got that right. Now you listen up. I’m
sorry for what happened to you and your folks years ago. But no one in
Forest Green wants to be reminded of what that maniac did here. That’s
why they changed the name to Forest Green. People want to forget this
was once Crystal Lake. And they don’t need some kid stirring up Jason
shit again.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Why didn’t you cremate him?!</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: They were gonna! But some asshole sent a
lot of money to give Jason and his mother a decent burial. Now look, you
just lie down and get some rest. In the morning I’ll call that clinic
and see if they…</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: If you’d just go to the cemetery, you’ll see
I’m not lying.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Either you go to sleep or I’ll come in
there and put you out.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You’re gonna be sorry you didn’t listen to
me.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: You’re gonna be sorry if you don’t shut the
fuck up.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Will you slow down? It’s hard enough to read
this thing.</p>
<p><strong>lizbeth</strong>: Well, who told me to take this cow
path?</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: You admit the sign did say “Camp Forest
Green,” with an arrow pointing this way.</p>
<p><strong>lizbeth</strong>: I admit nothing without talking to my
lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: So much for the head counselors ever finding
the camp on their own. I say we stop the car, get out, and start
screaming for help.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: I was just kidding, Lizbeth.</p>
<p><strong>lizbeth</strong>: Darren, we better turn around.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>lizbeth</strong>: Why? Because I’ve seen enough horror movies
to know masked weirdos are never friendly.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Wait!</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: There’s no way we can do this… …If the car
drops into that gully, we’ll never get it out.</p>
<p><strong>lizbeth</strong>: Do you have any alternate suggestions?</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Yeah… We’re gonna scare him.</p>
<p><strong>lizbeth</strong>: We’re gonna scare him?!</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: That’s right. Just drive toward him. He’ll
move. Nobody wants to die.</p>
<p><strong>lizbeth</strong>: That’s a freakin’ fact. Least of all
us.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Just drive. He’ll get out of our way.</p>
<p><strong>lizbeth</strong>: Yeah, that really scared the shit out of
him.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Oh, jeez.</p>
<p><strong>lizbeth</strong>: That’s it. We’re driving this baby back to
town… in reverse.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: The hell we are.</p>
<p><strong>lizbeth</strong>: Where’d you get that?</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Don’t worry about it. Just stay cool.</p>
<p><strong>lizbeth</strong>: Stay cool? You ain’t Dirty Harry. Now stop
it.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: All right, scumbag. Get out of the road.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Now!</p>
<p><strong>lizbeth</strong>: Darren, get in here right now! He’ll kill
you!</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Not if I get him first.</p>
<p><strong>spear smashes through the windshield and impales itself
into</strong>: THE DRIVER’S SEAT.</p>
<p><strong>lizbeth</strong>: Don’t kill me, please. You can have
these.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Come on, Dad. You could have Rick drive down
Cunningham Road and look for them.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Megan, my deputies have more important
things to do than look for camp counselors with car trouble.</p>
<p><strong>cort</strong>: Sheriff, couldn’t you like put our an
all-points bulletin for them? That would be really wicked decent.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: It’s just that Darren and Lizbeth are in
charge of organizing and setting up the new campgrounds.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: All the little kids arrive today. We’re not
ready to deal with that alone.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: I sympathize with you kids. The best I can
do is call the station in Carpenter and have them keep a lookout for
them.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I got a bad feeling of what might’ve happened
to them.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You’ve got to convince the sheriff to look
for your friends. Hopefully, they’re fine. But there’s a very good
chance that Jason…</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Jason who?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Megan, get away from him. He’s
dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I’m not dangerous, believe me. Jason is out
there. He’s looking for me. But there’s every possibility he’ll return
to the camp where it all started.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: I told you to shut…</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: You mean the Jason of Camp Blood?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: No!… … You kids better leave. This boy here
is not well and I need to talk to him in private.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: But, Dad, we…</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Megan, take your friends back to the camp.
I’ll let you know if I hear anything about your counselors.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Don’t beat him up too bad, he’s kinda
cute.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Megan, leave!</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: I was going to call the clinic and have
them collect your ass. But I don’t want you around here any longer
poisoning my daughter, or anyone else, with your warped mind.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: But they have to be warned, Sheriff. Jason
will return to the area that’s familiar. No matter what you call it,
it’s still Camp Crystal Lake to him.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: We’re gonna escort you and that shit-pile
pickup of yours to the edge of my jurisdiction…. ….Then we’ll say
goodbye and we’ll never see your deranged butt around here again…
…Right?</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Once we nail Roy, that’s it. Victory is
ours.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: This is taking forever. I’m starving.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: That’s your problem, Larry. That’s why your
sales are always below quota. Your instinct to eat is stronger than your
instinct to win.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: My ass.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Yeah, that’s fat too.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: You become a whole other person when you’re
out here, Stan. And I don’t like it.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: This is a man’s game. Requiring a man’s
cunning and intelligence…</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: ….with a woman’s touch.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Now wait a second! I thought Burt shot
you.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: See any paint?… …Sorry, guys, I did in
Mr. Commando. Survival is the name of the game, and that flag is
mine.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Never should’ve let her play.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: It’s a damn company executive game, and she’s
a damn company exec.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Now, now, boys. Don’t be spoilsports.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: I’m getting worried.</p>
<p><strong>cort</strong>: About Jason.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: No…about Darren and Lizbeth. They should have
at least called. Don’t you think, Megan?…Megan.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Huh? Yeah, what?</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: This girl’s back in the cell with her
prisoner of love.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: What’s it to ya?</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Don’t be playin’ with no crazy jailbird.
Those dudes are bad news.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Yeah? How would you know?</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: I’ve been around long enough…to see plenty on
TV.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: I don’t know, Megan. He seemed pretty weird
with all that Jason stuff.</p>
<p><strong>cort</strong>: Yeah, he was really into it.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Maybe he was telling the truth.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Just because our parents keep telling us that
Jason was only a legend, doesn’t mean it wasn’t true. What if Jason did
come back here… …And you know what today’s date is, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: I can think of only one thing even more
terrifying.</p>
<p><strong>cort</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: I think I’d rather deal with ol’ Jason.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Oh, shit. Shit-SHIT!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Oh-hh. Why me?…I know he’s gonna blame me
for this.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Damn. Why Jason? Mothers could have their
pick… …of any of these other graves.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Shitheads couldn’t even stick him back in
right. Well, I ain’t gonna touch the slimy sucker.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: He can’t find out. He’ll think I ain’t doin’
my job. I need that money…He won’t find out… …No one’s gonna know…I need
my money.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: It’s kinda frightening to think that a kid
like that can go so far over the edge. Jason really screwed up the poor
sonofabitch’s mind.</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: He really believes Jason’s still alive,
doesn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: But that’s no what worries me the most…It’s
how far he’ll go to try and prove it.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Come on, you guys! The game’s over!!</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: You don’t know for sure. What about Roy?
Nobody’s seen him.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Of course not. If he hasn’t already
accidentally pelleted himself, I’m sure he’s lost.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Yeah, but the game’s not over until it’s
over.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Shh-hh. Wait a second. What was that?</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Ahh, nothing.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: I could swear I heard…</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Oh, God, help me! Somebody, help!! He’s trying
to kill me!!</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Fuckin’ A, what’d I tell ya!… …Hit the
noise and cherries.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: I’m getting real tired of this maniac.</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: Maybe we better call that psychiatric
clinic.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Better call an ambulance first.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I gotta show you Jason’s grave.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: I’ve seen it.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Please, Sheriff. You’ll see we dug it up.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Well, he must’ve got chilly in the night
and pulled the dirt back over.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: That’s not right. Somebody covered it up… …I
gotta see it…</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Now see what you’ve done. You’ve made my
deputy draw his revolver. That could be a serious headache for you. He’s
been dyin’ to try out his new mail-order laser scope.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: It’s a damn impressive piece of high-tech
weaponry… Wherever the red dot goes… a bullet is sure to follow.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: What’s the problem, Sheriff?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Nothing, Martin. Just a vagrant kid. We got
it under control.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Who covered up Jason’s grave?!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: What!? What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Don’t concern yourself, Martin. This boy
needs treatment. We’re taking care of it. Sorry for the disturbance.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Jason’s not in his coffin! Hawes is! Dig it
up! You gotta dig it up!!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Dig it up?… …Hell, what kinda butt-hole does
he think I am!</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: …And then after that we’ll swim, hike, and
have lots of fun together. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: So where’s Cort gone off to?</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Are you ready? He’s taken our young men off
to teach them my favorites sport.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Which is?</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Boy scouting.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: You gotta be kidding!</p>
<p><strong>tyen</strong>: You gotta be kidding!</p>
<p><strong>cort</strong>: No, seriously… the Indian scout would arrange
the rocks in such a way that like only his fellow Indians would know.
You know, which way he went… …You know?</p>
<p><strong>tyen</strong>: If this is as exciting as it gets, we’re in
big trouble, dude.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: I don’t find it amusing that the nut house
you belong in thinks you’re responsible enough to leave here unescorted.
In fact, it gripes my ass.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: You’ve been damn lucky, pisshead. With all
the grief you’ve caused me and my partner, you should be leaving wearing
your balls as earrings.</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: I think we should do it to him anyway.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Naw. But if we see ol’ Tommy ever again…
you can guarantee it.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Okay, okay. I suggest that the crime was
committed in the bedroom, by Colonel Mustard, with the knife.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Huh? Oh, come on, Sis. I’m tellin’ ya, we
can’t play Clue with just two people.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Why not? I used to play it alone. I love
murder games. Have you ever played The Consulting Detective?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: No…Did Megan say when she’s coming back from
her…visit?</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Of course not. She probably took him a loaf
of bread with a saw hidden in it. I still don’t get it. Why him? I mean,
he’s cute alright, but…</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Isn’t that enough?</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: You’re right. And for the area, that even
makes him overqualified.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: I’m gonna call her at the ol’ jail house.
Maybe her dad has found out what happened to Darren and Lizbeth by now…
…I can’t believe they haven’t called. I say if they’re not here by
morning, we send all the kids home. We’re not prepared to run this place
by ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>little girl</strong>: She saw a monster.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Who did?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Hi. Everything’s all right now. We’re
here.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Yeah, we’re here.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: So what happened?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: There was this monster. He was after me. He
wanted to kill me.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Where…?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: You mean you had a bad dream.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: No, he was real. Like on TV.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Okay, listen…what’s your name, sweetie?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Nancy.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Well, Nancy, I’m Paula… remember? This is
Sissy, and we’re gonna be right out there all night so nothing can hurt
you. Okay?…</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: …Good. So no more bad dreams can come around
here, huh?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: No more.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Now you all go back to Z-land. We’re on the
job and ya don’t have to worry about shit…</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: …What? I’m sure they hear worse at home.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: I just realized something. Where’s Cort? I
haven’t seen him for hours.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: I don’t know. He called somebody, then took
off.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: He didn’t say anything?</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Yeah, he was gonna check out “things that go
bump in the night.”</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: They’re the best. The best… …You gotta keep it
up till the end of the song.</p>
<p><strong>cort</strong>: I’m tryin’…how much longer?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Only ten more minutes.</p>
<p><strong>jill’s voice</strong>: Oh, fuck.</p>
<p><strong>cort’s voice</strong>: Oh ye-aaah.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Wait a second, I’ll… …Cort, you didn’t
already…</p>
<p><strong>cort</strong>: I thought that was the end of the song.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Great. Just great.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: If this thing is burned out, friggin’ Horace
will ground my butt.</p>
<p><strong>cort</strong>: Who’s Horace?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: My friggin’ stepfather and asshole-
in-residence.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: How did that happen?</p>
<p><strong>cort</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Go out and plug the cord back in.</p>
<p><strong>cort</strong>: What? Who pulled it out?!</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Smokey the friggin’ bear. I don’t know, just
do it.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Will you hurry up! I gotta get this fuckmobile
back before Horace finds out I took it.</p>
<p><strong>cort</strong>: Alright, alright.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: What are you doing?… …What happened to it?</p>
<p><strong>cort</strong>: I don’t know… …But unless you wanna look
exactly like it, I say we make this place a memory.</p>
<p><strong>cort</strong>: I think someone’s out there.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: I don’t wanna know.</p>
<p><strong>cort</strong>: This can’t be.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: It isn’t.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Are you gonna drive or not?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: That’s it. Pull over. I’m drivin’.</p>
<p><strong>cort</strong>: No way… …I wanna rock!</p>
<p><strong>cort</strong>: Sounds like you’re havin’ fun in there! Need
any company?!</p>
<p><strong>cort</strong>: Hey, what are you doing? Taking a dump?… How
about if I come back and snatch a peek. Or vice versa.</p>
<p><strong>cort</strong>: Alright! Yo, Jill! Listen to this!</p>
<p><strong>close on back of cort’s head as the jagged knife plunges
into</strong>: HIS EAR. Suddenly, all SOUND CUTS OUT.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: What makes you so high and mighty?… You
keep forgetting, little Megan, I’m the parent…</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: …And you’re the child…</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: When are you going to stop treating me like
one!</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: When you stop acting like one… Tommy Jarvis
is a very sick boy. And you…</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: How do you know? Did you take his
temperature?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: You watch that smart-mouthing, young
lady.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Kinda hard to see it from this angle? Got a
mirror?</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Now tell me, “If your mother was alive, you
wouldn’t…”</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: That’s it! Out! I don’t need this tonight.
Out, Megan!</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Sheriff’s office… …Can you hold on? He’s in
the can draining his lizard.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: …Oh, here he comes now… …Daddy, it’s
Rick.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: What?!…What kinda problem?!</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: You better get down here. I found what’s
left of the counselors. Looks like someone did them in using Jason’s old
M.O.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: I knew I should’ve done something about
that sonofa… Where are you?… …Right. I’m on my way.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: What it is?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Not what…who. Seems your boyfriend wants
people to believe Jason has returned.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: I thought Jason was only a legend?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: He is. Only Tommy wants to prove the legend
is true… …You stay put. And I’m not kidding.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Sheriff’s office… …No, I’m sorry, he’s not in
at the moment. Can I take a message?</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: …Oh, hi. I’m Megan, his daughter. Remember, I
met you this morning…</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Yeah, hi. Listen, I’ve got to talk to your
dad. About Jason. I’ve got a plan. I need to buy some things first but
mainly need help to…</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Tommy, my father is out looking for you right
now. Something happened tonight and he’s sure you’re responsible. If he
finds you, he’ll…</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I already have a very good idea what could’ve
happened… …Megan, Jason is out there. He has to be stopped. I’m positive
he’s heading back to the lake area. He’ll keep killing until…</p>
<p><strong>megan’s voice</strong>: I’ll pick you up. Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: It’s the only way. My father will nail you in
your car in a second… …Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Uh…Howie’s Service Station and Feed Bag Stop.
I think it’s…</p>
<p><strong>megan’s voice</strong>: I know where it is. See you within a
half-hour.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: I want all officers, all units and stations
within a fifty-mile radius alerted about this wacko kid.</p>
<p><strong>officer pappas</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: You have his vehicle description. I want
roadblocks on…</p>
<p><strong>deputy’s voice</strong>: Sheriff! Get over here!!</p>
<p><strong>deputy’s voice</strong>: Sheriff, over here!</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Is that all you found?</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: I wish it was.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Better get out the Hefty Bags… Looks like
our boy desperately wants us to believe his story.</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: He sure chose the right day to pull this
shit.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Whaddya mean?</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: Happy Friday the 13th.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: All right, who’s out there?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: What’s goin’ on?</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: I think somebody’s messin’ around out
there.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: It’s gotta be Cort. He loves to scare people…
…Teach him a lesson.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Hey, you guys. Try got to wake the kids.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I’m gonna borrow your car. You can’t do this
with me. It’s much too dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: And you can’t leave that truck out in plain
sight. Talk about dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Hide it behind the gas station. Then we can
get the hell out of here.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Look, this isn’t a game. You’re not going
with me. I’m already responsible for causing the death of…</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Didn’t you say you needed some supplies to do
this?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Uh…yes. But…</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Then let’s get goin’. We can argue on the
way. You tell me what you need… …I’ll make sure you get in.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: …And nobody drives this baby but me… …Now get
that pickup hid and let’s boog.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Can this tub go any faster?</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: You got it. Just keep an eye out for
roadblocks.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Okay. There’s one.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Get down.</p>
<p><strong>officer pappas</strong>: Unit 45, Officer Pappas to Sheriff
Garris. Do you copy?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Yeah, I’m here. What?</p>
<p><strong>officer pappas’ voice</strong>: Got a different vehicle that
just turned tail seeing us. Saw somebody duck down.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Got a description or plates?</p>
<p><strong>officer pappas’ voice</strong>: The whole enchilada. It’s an
’82 orange Camaro, license…</p>
<p><strong>sheriff’s voice</strong>: Son of a shittin’ bitch! That’s my
daughter’s car!!</p>
<p><strong>officer pappas</strong>: How should we proceed, sir?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: With extreme car, for God’s sake. If that
kid is with her, there’s every good chance he’ll do something crazy.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Please don’t do anything crazy.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: I know what I’m doing. I got your supplies
for ya, didn’t I?… Now if I can get to Cunningham Road, I can lose them…
…Just stay where you are.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Whatever you say.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: That’s what I want.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: This is gonna be a hairy turn. Grab ahold of
something.</p>
<p><strong>shockingly, her father and his car are waiting in the
dark</strong>: FOR THEM. The deputy and his car are right behind the
sheriff. Both have their rifles aimed and ready.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Megan, step out of the car!</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: It’s all over.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: It’s just beginning.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I can’t sleep, Paula. I’m scared. I saw
someone at the window and…</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Where’d you get this?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I found it outside.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: You know what? Sissy and Cort are playing
jokes. You know, trying to scare each other.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Well, grown-ups think it’s funny to be
scared.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Are they grown-ups?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: That’s debatable.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Never mind… …Is it that lake already?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: I can’t believe no one called back. I
better…</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Who ya calling?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Why don’t we first try and find Sissy and
Cort, then you can go to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: But what if they try and scare us?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: We’ll scare ’em right back.</p>
<p><strong>without warning, jason’s masked face is before us. a
sting</strong>: accompanies this SHOCK CUT.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: …And I said, shut up!</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: All he’s asking is for you to check it
out.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You got me where you want me. There’s no
reason not…</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: If I had you where I really wanted you,
they’d be pumping your ass full of formaldehyde.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Can’t you at least call the camp and make
sure everything’s all right?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: We have! Trying to track you down. The
phone there is disconnected.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Doesn’t that tell you something?!</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Yeah…They should’ve paid their bill.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: You just sit tight, Jason. Once the
authorities from Carpenter get here, you’ll…</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: Sheriff, you better take this.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Sheriff Garris… …Approximately what time?
…I’ll be right there.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: What?…What happened?!</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Rick. Keep and eye on our wacko kid. I’ll
be back as soon as I can.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Daddy, what is going on?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: And make sure my daughter stays put… …She’s
grounded.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Tell me!!</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: They just found your friend Cort and some
girl. She was brutally strangled, and Cort…he had a knife rammed through
his skull.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: No. No, it’s not…</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Yes, Megan. Tommy Jarvis is a killer. A
very deranged boy who wants you to believe that…</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Jason did do it. I swear! Sheriff, when were
they murdered?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: For God’s sake, stat away from him. Please,
Meggie.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Dad…What time were they murdered?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: They think somewhere around 8:30 or
9:00.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: I was with Tommy all that time.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Rick, I’ll call you when I get there.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Damn.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: I’m sure Cort and Sissy are back in their
cabins. So you just go back to sleep and don’t worry.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: But what I get scared again?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Shhh…You know what I used to do when I was a
little girl when I got scared?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: I would close my eyes and say a little
prayer. And pretty soon, you know what? Everything scary went away… …It
worked for me. I’ll bet it’ll work for you too.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Good night. See ya in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Sissy?</p>
<p><strong>the machete she left on the floor is gone. bloody stains
on</strong>: THE FLOOR MARK WHERE IT HAD LAIN.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: So what are ya drawin’?</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: What’s it to ya?</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: Hey, pipe down, Jarvis.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I was just curious about what she was
drawin’.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: There…Ya happy?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: ’Cause it stinks.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Okay, give it back.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Come and get it.</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: Bastard…Megan, I’ll get in.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Give it to me, punk.</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: You stinkin’ maggot, I oughta…!</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Let him out of there.</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: Come on, Megan, don’t clown around.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: I ain’t the one with the funny red nose…Open
the cell and exchange places…with him… …Now.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Better do as she says, ’cause …wherever the
red dot goes, a bullet is sure to follow.</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: You brainwashed her, you sonofabitch?</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Yeah, something like that.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Got the keys?</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: No, he took ’em…But I got my Hide-a-Key.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Sorry, Megan. Not this time.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Wait a minute. I just…</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I thank you for getting me out. But I gotta
finish what I started.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Well, come on, hot lips, let’s go. You drive,
I’ll navigate.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord
my soul to keep…</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: …If I should die before I wake, I pray the
Lord my soul to take. Now I lay me… etc.</p>
<p><strong>officer thornton</strong>: So what’s the story here?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Why don’t you boys nose around. I gotta go
break the news to Megan’s friends about what’s happened. Holler if you
see anything.</p>
<p><strong>officer pappas</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Anything that don’t belong. And don’t wake
the kids.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Girls? It’s Sheriff Garris.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Let me know when you’re about to blast into
hyperspace. I’ll fasten my seat belt.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I got a bad feeling we’re already too
late.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Are you sure this is gonna work? I mean, why
didn’t we bring that gun and just blast him away?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: It probably wouldn’t have any effect on him.
The only sure way to stop Jason is to return him to his original resting
place, where he drowned in 1957.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Lake Forest Green?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Crystal Lake…where the nightmare began.</p>
<p><strong>officer pappas</strong>: Alright, come out of there!</p>
<p><strong>officer pappas</strong>: I’m askin’ you one more time …come
out of there!</p>
<p><strong>officer pappas</strong>: Hey, hey, what are you doing running
around out here? Now you get back to bed.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: No. There’s a scary man.</p>
<p><strong>officer pappas</strong>: What scary man?</p>
<p><strong>jason’s fingers dig in to the cop’s skin. he yanks
down,</strong>: LITERALLY RIPPING THE SKIN OFF HIS SKULL.</p>
<p><strong>a bloody grinning skull stares at us for a moment, then
drops</strong>: FROM VIEW.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Hold on. Take it easy. I got you.
Everything is fine.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Kids, listen to me very carefully. I want
everyone to lie down on the floor and stay there. Do not get up until I
come back. Now hurry.</p>
<p><strong>the sheriff’s face lands pressed against the grotesque
bloody</strong>: SKULL. Horribly repulsed, he scrambles to his feet.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: They did show up. Isn’t that great?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I hope so.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Megan, wait!</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Dad!…Daddy!!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: No, Megan!</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: It’s okay. It’s me–Megan. Don’t be
afraid.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: It’s all right. Shhh-hh.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Now I gotta find my daddy, the sheriff, so we
can all go home. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: So you stay here and we’ll be back to get
you. Everyone lie back down and don’t worry.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>tyen</strong>: I think we’re dead meat.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Megan! Use your dad’s car radio and call for
assistance…and an ambulance!</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Oh, God! Oh my God!</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Dad! Answer me! Daddy, where are you! Help
us!</p>
<p><strong>tyen</strong>: Real dead meat.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: No! Not her!</p>
<p><strong>jason shockingly tears the sheriff’s arms out of
their</strong>: SOCKETS. He throws them aside.</p>
<p><strong>jason grips the shrieking lawman’s head. he pushes it
back,</strong>: CAUSING THE SHERIFF’S BODY TO BEND ALL THE WAY
BACKWARDS.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: You gotta help me look for him…We need him to
help us.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Whew…Okay, hand me those padlocks.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Did you hear me?!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Yes. And I said, hand me those padlocks.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: You’re gonna be sorry.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I hope not.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Megan! Get back into the cabin with the
kids.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Megan, please!</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: No. Don’t leave.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Megan, get in there with them before it’s too
late.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Megan!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: JASON!!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Come on, Jason! It’s me you want! Come and
get me!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: That’s it! Come on, pus-head!</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Tommy, get out of there! Row to the other
side of the lake! Hurry!!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Hey, asshole! It’s me you want, remember?!
Come on, chickhenshit, I’m sittin’ here waitin’!</p>
<p><strong>just as jason reaches the boat, he submerges,
disappearing</strong>: INTO THE DARK WATERS.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Is he kill-ded?</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Stay here.</p>
<p><strong>one of megan’s powerful kicks drives into jason’s throat.
a</strong>: stream of final air bubbles and disgusting, ugly black fluid
rushes from his mask!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: It’s over, Megan. It’s finally over. Jason is
home.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: You.. .ha-ha.. frightened me. I was just,
you know, cleaning up the…place, you know. Ha-ha.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Er.. nice to see you again,
Mr. Voorhees…Haven’t seen you in Crystal…er, Forest Green, in quite some
time.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Hey, I’ve been takin’ real good care of your
wife and son’s graves. Go look. You’ll be real pleased.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Thank you, Mr. Voorhees. Thank you. I’ll
leave you in private, like you like. Okay, er…bye. Thank you.</p>
