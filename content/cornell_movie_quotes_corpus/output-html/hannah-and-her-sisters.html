<p><strong>elliot</strong>: God, she’s beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: She’s got the prettiest eyes, and she looks
so sexy in that sweater.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Hi, how are you?</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: I just want to be alone with her and hold
her and kiss her…</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: …and tell her how much I love her and take
care of her. Stop it, you idiot. She’s your wife’s sister. But I can’t
help it.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: I’m consumed by her. It’s been months now. I
dream about her. I- I, I think about her at the office. Oh, Lee. What am
I gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: I hear myself mooning over you, and it’s
disgusting. Before, when she…</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: …squeezed past me in the doorway, and I
smelled that perfume on the back of her neck…</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: …Jesus, I, I thought I was gonna swoon!
Easy…</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: You’re a dignified financial advisor. It
doesn’t look good for you to swoon.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Elliot? Elliot? Sweetheart?</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Mm-hm?</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Have you tried these? These are wonderful.
Holly and her friend made them.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: They’re fantastic.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Aren’t they great?</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Your sister is an unbelievable cook.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: I know! I know!</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: She has all the cooking talent.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: No, she doesn’t, either. You’ve got tons as
well.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Ohhh, but I’ve eaten five of these.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Holly, why don’t you open your own
restaurant?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: offscreen Elliot and</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: What? You’re kidding!</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: No, no, we decided!</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Perfect!</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Mmm…I mean, we love to cook for our friends,
so we thought until an acting job comes through, we could just make some
extra money, you know, doing a few private parties.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Great idea.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: That’s where your talent lies.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Get outta here. Could I speak to you
privately?</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Oh, sure.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: as he nibbles on an</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Hannah, I have to borrow some more money.
Don’t get upset.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Mmm, I never get upset over that. Mmm?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: This is the last time, I promise. And I’m
keeping strict accounts.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Holly, please. Don’t insult me.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: glass and plate down</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: I know. H-how much do you need?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Two thousand dollars.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Hannah, I know it’s a lot, but my friend
April and I, we have this catering idea I think’s going to be great.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: You admit that we’re great cooks, right?</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: stove now, stirring</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Well, in order to get started, there’s just a
few things I have to buy… and some old debts I have outstanding.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Will you just tell me one thing?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Are we talking about cocaine again?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: I swear. I swear. We’ve already got some
requests to do a few dinner parties.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: I mean, obviously, I’m not going to be a
caterer forever, you know. We both still go to auditions. Something
could turn up at any moment. But the parties are at night, days are
free, I can still take my acting class. I haven’t done drugs on a
year.</p>
<p><strong>evan &amp; norma</strong>: “A whimpering, simpering Child
again Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered Am I…”</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Mom and Dad are floating down memory lane
again!</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Aah… Hey, have you tried Holly and her
friend’s shrimp puffs?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: I think they’re fantastic.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: You’ve outdone yourself.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: sisters, shrugging</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: I need an antihistamine. Mom thinks she’s
feeling her asthma, and so…</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Ohh?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Uh-oh.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: …before she starts turning into Camille…</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Yeah, Mom’s Camille when she gets up in the
morning.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: At least she isn’t drinking. Did you
notice?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Mm-hm.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Doesn’t she look great in that new
dress?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Don’t you think she does?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: She really does, though.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Yeah, she knows it, too, ’cause she’s flirting
with all the men here.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: God.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Maybe when she’s eighty, she’ll stop
straightening her garter belt when there’s a guy around.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: I should get a garter belt.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Get a garter belt… Get a garter belt and
flirt.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Where are the antihistamines?</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Oh, I don– Ask Elliot for that. Uh, he’s got
them somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Frederick didn’t come with her.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: When does Frederick ever come with her?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Tch. He’s such an angry…he’s such a
depressive. I thought she was moving out!</p>
<p><strong>evan &amp; norma</strong>: “A pill he is But still he is All
mine and I’ll Keep him until he is Bewitched, a’both–”</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Watch out, you guys. Beep-beep!</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Oh, your kids are so adorable.</p>
<p><strong>children</strong>: Bye! Bye!</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: God, it gets so lonely on the holidays.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: turkey on the opposite</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Oh, Hannah!</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: It’s, uh, you never know–</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: He’s such a loser!</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: He’s not a loser at all!</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Oh, he’s such a loser!</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: a set of candles on</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Oh, perfect! He reminds me of Ichabod Crane.
His Adam’s apple keeps jumping up and down whenever he gets excited.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Listen. He’s a lot better than your
ex-husband. He’s got a good job. Would you light those, please?
He’s-he’s-he’s not a dope addict or anything.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Give me a break.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Am I interrupting…</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: …any sister talk?</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Mm-mm!</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Oh, good…</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Come in, come in.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: …because there are no interesting single men
at this party!</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Oh, listen…</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: I know. It’s terrible!</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: I mean, I’ve looked everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Maybe April would like Phil. Phil Gammage,
the tall guy in there by the piano.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Hm-mm. Oh, yeah. I met Phil.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Mmm?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: He’s the–He looks like Ichabod Crane?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: I love that. That’s my type.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: I can’t believe it!</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: No, really, I really like him a lot.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: No, really, we mustn’t get discouraged.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Hannah will invite some men over who don’t
look like Ichabod Crane.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Mmm.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Not this Thanksgiving, you know.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: April, who has just</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Maybe at Christmas, New Year’s. If not this
New Year’s, maybe next New Year’s.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Ouch!</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Must be here someplace.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Oh, you know, I, I love that book you lent me.
The Easter Parade? You were right. It had very special meaning for
me.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: How’s Frederick? He didn’t come.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Oh, well, you know Frederick. One of his moods.
Although it wasn’t a bad week. He uh, sold a picture.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Oh, great.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Yeah, it was, it was one of his better
drawings, a very beautiful nude study. Actually, it was of me. It’s
funny, you know, it’s a funny feeling to know you’re being hung naked in
some stranger’s living room.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Well, you can’t tell it’s me, although– You’re
turning all red, Elliot.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Really? So, so, what else? Wh- what are you
up to?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Oh, I don’t know. My unemployment checks are
running out. Um, I was thinking of taking some courses at Columbia with
the last of my savings.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Like, uh…?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: I don’t know exactly.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Uh, sociology, psychology maybe. I always
thought I might like to work with children.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: bottle of pills</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Yeah, sure. You know, uh, Frederick would
really by grateful for a sale.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Hey, you guys?</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Dinner’s ready.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Oh, great.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: You look so beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Doesn’t she look pretty?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: I bumped into your…</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: …ex-husband on the street the other day.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Oh, yeah?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: He was, he’s just as crazy as ever. He was on
his way to get a blood test.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: God, Mickey’s such a hypochondriac. I wonder
how he’d handle it if there was ever anything really wrong with him?</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Let’s go have dinner, shall we?</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Mmm.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Good idea.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: silverware against</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Dad.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Dad…</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Oh…</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Dad!</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: No, now…</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: I’m starving!</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: …this is a toast! This is a toast.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: table for Evan’s wine</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: This is a toast. You know this beautiful
Thanksgiving dinner was all…</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: …prepared…by Hannah.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Uh, and a little help…</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: …from Mavis, also.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: You bet.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: down the table while</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: No, you did it.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: April, April!</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: I am… I did slave all day.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: And we drink to her, and we all congratulate
her on her wonderful accomplishment during this last year…her great
success in A Doll’s House!</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Ya-a-a-a-y! I played Nora. I hate to tell you
what year…</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: And it’s very difficult to behave like
Torvald’s little chipmunk without making a perfect ass out of yourself!
Now I think that Ibsen would have been damn proud of our Hannah!</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Speech! Speech! Speech!</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Yea-a-a-a-ah!</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: I don’t know about that. Oh, no, I just,
see, I-I’ve been very, very lucky. W-when I had the kids, I decided to
stop working and just, you know, devote myself to having the family, and
I’ve been very, very happy but…I’ve always secretly hoped that maybe
some little gem would come along and tempt me back on the stage…</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: …just for a second. So, now I got that out
of my system and I can go back to the thing that makes me happiest.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Oh, bravo! Bravo!</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Is it my imagination, or does Elliot have a
little crush on me? It’s funny. I’ve had that thought before. He pays a
lot of attention to me all the time, and he blushed tonight when we were
alone in the bedroom. I wonder if he and Hannah are happy? It’s funny,
I…I still feel a little buzz from his flirting.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Want some coffee or tea?</p>
<p><strong>frederick</strong>: No, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: How about something to eat?</p>
<p><strong>frederick</strong>: No, nothing.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>frederick</strong>: Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Mmm, what am I gonna do with you?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: God! And why didn’t you come tonight? We all
had a terrific time. I really think you would have enjoyed yourself.</p>
<p><strong>frederick</strong>: I’m going through a period of my life
where I just can’t be around people. I didn’t want to wind up abusing
anyone.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: You’re not going to abuse them. They’re all so
sweet.</p>
<p><strong>frederick</strong>: Lee… you are the only person I can be
with…who I really look forward to being with.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: You’re too harsh with everyone. You know that,
don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>frederick</strong>: Isn’t it enough that I can love you?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Mmm…</p>
<p><strong>frederick</strong>: Hmm?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: …you’re such a puzzle. So sweet with me and
so…contemptuous of everyone else.</p>
<p><strong>frederick</strong>: Well, there was a time when you were very
happy to be only with me. You wanted to learn everything about poetry,
about music.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Mm-hm.</p>
<p><strong>frederick</strong>: Have I really taught you everything I
have to give? I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Oh, Elliot said he might have a couple of
clients for you.</p>
<p><strong>frederick</strong>: I’m sure all those morons he handles have
a deep feeling for art.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Mmm you never know. They might. He’s just
trying to do the nice thing.</p>
<p><strong>frederick</strong>: Because he likes you.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>frederick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>frederick</strong>: Elliot lusts after you.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Based on what? You never even see him.</p>
<p><strong>frederick</strong>: Based on…whenever you see him, you always
come home full of books he’s recommended…</p>
<p><strong>frederick</strong>: …or films you must see or…</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Oh, no, no, no. He’s my sister’s husband. And I
think if you gave him half a chance, you’d like him. He’s very
intelligent.</p>
<p><strong>frederick</strong>: He’s a glorified accountant, and he’s
after you. And I prefer to sell my work to people who appreciate it, not
to rock stars. You understand?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Ohhh!</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: What do you mean, they won’t let us do the
sketch?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Talk to Standards and Practices. They think
it’s too dirty.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: But we showed it to them in rehearsal!</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: You know, what’d they do, figure out what
the words mean?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Mickey, we got a half hour to air!</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: We’re short! The show is five minutes
short!</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: How could it be short? We timed everything
long.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: If we have to…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: …pull out the sketch, then we’ll be ten
minutes short!</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: I don’t know how they can do that to us.
That’s– We go on in thirty minutes, right?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: They’re doing it because our ratings are
low.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: I got such a migraine.</p>
<p><strong>gail</strong>: Hey, Mickey!</p>
<p><strong>gail</strong>: Mickey! Listen, we better go right to Ronny’s
dressing room. This kid must have taken sixteen hundred Quaaludes. I
don’t think he’s going to be able to do the show!</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Why me, Lord? What did I–</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: You– Standards and Practices?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Ed Smythe, yes.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Okay. Why, all of a sudden, is the sketch
dirty?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Child molestation is a touchy subject…</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Could you–</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: …with the affiliates.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Read the papers! Half the country’s doing
it!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Yes, but you name names.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: We nev– We don’t name names! We say the
Pope.</p>
<p><strong>gail</strong>: We always say the Pope!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: That sketch…</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: We–</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: …cannot go on the air.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Oh, Je–</p>
<p><strong>writer</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>writer</strong>: Who changed my sketch about the PLO?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: I had to make some cuts. It’s four lousy
lines!</p>
<p><strong>writer</strong>: The whole premise is ruined!</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Oh, you’re crazy! It’s not so delicate.
Everybody’s married to every line.</p>
<p><strong>gail</strong>: Mickey, I can–</p>
<p><strong>writer</strong>: I don’t care! I don’t want anyone tampering
with my goddamn work without telling me!</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>writer</strong>: You want ’em cut?! I’ll cut ’em myself!</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: All right, all right.</p>
<p><strong>gail</strong>: to get Mickey’s</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: You know…</p>
<p><strong>gail</strong>: In-in-in-instead of the child molestation
sketch, why don’t we repeat the Cardinal Spellman Ronald Reagan
homosexual dance number?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: No–</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: I don’t feel good, Mickey.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Yeah, wh– Yeah, what did you do? Swallow a
drugstore?!</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Look at this guy.</p>
<p><strong>gail</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: I lost my voice.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Oh, Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>gail</strong>: Ron…Ronny, you know you do have to go on in
twenty-five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Hey, does anybody got a Tagamet? My, my
ulcer’s starting to kill me!</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: You want a Quaalude?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Christ, this show is ruining my health!
Meanwhile, my ex-partner moves to California and every stupid show he
produces turns out to be a big hit. Brother, what am I gonna do with my
life? Speaking of that, I-I…gotta remember to see my ex-wife tomorrow.
Tch.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Hi! Hi!</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: I know…I know.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Glad you could put in an appearance.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: I got two minutes.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Very good.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: I got two minutes. ’Cause, God, the show is
killing me. I got a million appointments today. It just so happens it
fell this way.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: I gotta see new comedians later, I’ve
gotta–</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Two minutes on your sons’ birthday. You
know, it’s not going to kill you.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Happy Birthday, fellas! Happy Birthday!</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: chatter, bending down</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Yeah, aren’t you like, you know…</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: …a little, uh, hey! A little hug! What is
this? Now how ’bout a little action from the kids?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: How is everything?</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Everything’s good. Everything’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Yeah? Yeah? Okay, kids, you can open the
presents now.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Here, you guys. Open them up.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Let me get a little reaction here. How’s
Elliot?</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: He’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Oh, you know what? I’m trying to convince
him to produce a play.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: I think he’ll find that satisfying.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Really? That’ll be terrific for him, I
think.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: I think so.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: I like him. I think he’s a sweet guy.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: The few times that I’ve met him… Isn’t that
a great mitt?</p>
<p><strong>twin #1</strong>: Thank you, Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: ’Cause he’s a loser.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Ohh!</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: H-he’s so awkward and he’s clumsy like
me…</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: I know, I know.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: …so I, so I like that. I always like an
underconfident person…</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: That’s really nice!</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: …you know? I, uh…</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: You know, he’s been wanting a mitt.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: You’ve always had good taste in husbands,
so…</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Thanks, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Mh-hm.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: That’s a beauty!</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Isn’t that great?</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Go right over there.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Football!</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Come on! Hurry up! Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Wow!</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Go out, go out by the Sung vase and, and
catch this.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: See?</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Hey, d– Watch, watch the picture.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Gee, Hannah’s sweet. Although, sometimes I
still do get angry when I think of things. Oh, what the hell. At least,
I’m not paying child support. Oh, God, I hope there’s nothing physically
wrong with me, either.</p>
<p><strong>dr. abel</strong>: So what’s the, uh, problem this time?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: This time I really think I have
something.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: I mean, I’m absolutely convinced that-that–
You know, I mean, it’s not like that adenoidal thing, you know, where I
didn’t realize I had them out.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: So, so, but it was when I was younger,
so–</p>
<p><strong>dr. abel</strong>: You know, I saw your father this week
about his sinus…</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Mm-hm.</p>
<p><strong>dr. abel</strong>: …and, uh, he complained of chest
pains.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Well, this guy’s the real hypochondriac of
the family. I mean, he’s, you know, he’s–</p>
<p><strong>dr. abel</strong>: You mentioned on the phone that you’d had
some dizziness.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Yes, a little dizziness, and I think, I
think I’m developing a hearing loss in my right ear …or my left ear, my,
my left…oh, n-n-n-no. No, I’m sorry. It was my right, my right, my right
or my left ear.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Now I ca-can’t remember.</p>
<p><strong>dr. abel</strong>: Let’s take a look.</p>
<p><strong>dr. abel</strong>: Well, I’m sorry to say you have had a
significant drop in the high- decibel range of your right ear.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Really?!</p>
<p><strong>dr. abel</strong>: Have you been exposed to a loud noise
recently, or did you have a virus?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: No, I-I’ve been perfectly healthy. You know
me.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: I always, I-I always imagine that I have
things.</p>
<p><strong>dr. abel</strong>: When did you first notice this?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Oh, uh, about a month ago. Wha- what do I
have?</p>
<p><strong>dr. abel</strong>: You’ve had some dizzy spells. What about
ringing and buzzing? Have you, uh, noticed any of that?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Yes, now-now that you mention it, uh, I-I-I
have, uh, buzzing and also ringing. Ringing and buzzing. Um, am I going
deaf, or something?</p>
<p><strong>dr. abel</strong>: And it’s just in one ear?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Yes, is it, is it, uh, healthier to have
problems in both ears?</p>
<p><strong>dr. abel</strong>: What I’d like to do, is to make an
appointment for you at the hospital. I’d like to have them run some
tests.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: The hospital? What kind of tests?</p>
<p><strong>dr. abel</strong>: Now, don’t get alarmed. These are just
more sophisticated audiometry tests than I can run here. I mean, it’s,
it’s nothing.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Well, if it’s nothing, then why do I have to
go into the hospital at all? I mean, uh, I hear perfectly fine, so I’m,
so I’m a little weak on the, on the high decibels. So I, you know, I
won’t go to the opera.</p>
<p><strong>dr. abel</strong>: You know, there’s no reason for panic. I
just want to rule out some things.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>dr. abel</strong>: It’s nothing. Will you trust me?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Huh, uh, hello, Dr. Wilkes? Dr. Wilkes, this
is Mickey Sachs. You have a minute? I want to ask you a question.</p>
<p><strong>dr. wilkes</strong>: Sure, Mickey. What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: I-if you have, i-if you have a hearing loss
in one ear, and-and it’s not from a, uh, virus or a loud noise or
anything, wh-what are the possibilities?</p>
<p><strong>dr. wilkes</strong>: Anything. Uh, often it’s hereditary.
Flu, uh, even a small noise will do it.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Uh, right, but-but nothing worse?</p>
<p><strong>dr. wilkes</strong>: Well, yes, I guess the, uh, dark side of
the spectrum is a brain tumor.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>gail</strong>: Okay, so here’s the new pages.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Say, did cards get these?</p>
<p><strong>gail</strong>: No, not yet. No.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Well, let’s hope it’s good.</p>
<p><strong>gail</strong>: Yeah, really. Really.</p>
<p><strong>gail</strong>: Eh, we’ll be down in a minute, okay?</p>
<p><strong>gail</strong>: Mickey, what’s the matter with you? You’re all
white!</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: I feel dizzy. Sshh, you know, I don’t feel
well.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Do you hear a ringing? Is there, is there a,
is there a ringing sound?</p>
<p><strong>gail</strong>: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I hear, I hear it.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: N-n-no, not that.</p>
<p><strong>gail</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Like–</p>
<p><strong>gail</strong>: Uh, yeah, yeah. We’re going to be working late
tonight. N-no, we’ll order out. It’s all right. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Sssss, if I have a brain tumor, I don’t know
what I’m gonna do.</p>
<p><strong>gail</strong>: You don’t have a brain tumor. He didn’t say
you had a brain tumor.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: No, naturally they’re not gonna tell you,
because, well, you know, th–, sometimes the weaker ones will panic if
you tell ’em.</p>
<p><strong>gail</strong>: But not you.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Oh, God! Do you hear a buzzing? Is there a
buzzing?</p>
<p><strong>gail</strong>: Mickey, come on, we got a show to do!</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: I can’t keep my mind on the show.</p>
<p><strong>gail</strong>: But there’s nothing wrong with you.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: If there’s nothing wrong with me then why
does he want me to come back for tests?!</p>
<p><strong>gail</strong>: Well, he has to rule out certain things.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Like what?! What?</p>
<p><strong>gail</strong>: I don’t know. Cancer, I–</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Don’t say that! I don’t want to hear that
word! Don’t mention that while I’m in the building.</p>
<p><strong>gail</strong>: But you don’t have any symptoms!</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: You–I got the classic symptoms of a brain
tumor!</p>
<p><strong>gail</strong>: Two months ago, you thought you had a
malignant melanoma.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Naturally, I, I–Do you know I–The sudden
appearance of a black spot on my back!</p>
<p><strong>gail</strong>: It was on your shirt!</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: I–How was I to know?! Everyone was pointing
back here.</p>
<p><strong>gail</strong>: Come on, we’ve got to make some booking
decisions.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: I can’t. I can’t think of it. This morning,
I was so happy, you know. Now I, I don’t know what went wrong.</p>
<p><strong>gail</strong>: Eh, you were miserable this morning! We got
bad reviews, terrible ratings, the sponsors are furious…</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: desk, still wringing</p>
<p><strong>female brunch guest</strong>: These things are delicious!
What in the world are they?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Oh, um, those are quail eggs.</p>
<p><strong>female brunch guest</strong>: Oh, they’re very good.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Yeah, my friend April makes those. Here, try
the shrimp puffs. These are delicious.</p>
<p><strong>female brunch guest</strong>: Oh, thank you. That looks
great.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: I make those.</p>
<p><strong>female brunch guest</strong>: Mmm. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: The Stroganoff is ready.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: We’re a big hit.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Oh, in this we’re a big hit. Yesterday I
auditioned for Come Back Little Sheba. That, I wasn’t such a big
hit.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: You will be. You will be. You’ll get five
jobs next week.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Excuse me, are there any more claims?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: canap�s warming on</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I can’t resist.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Really? How flattering! Did you try the
shrimp puffs?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Listen, you guys are too attractive to be
caterers. Something’s wrong.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: We’re actresses.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Is this your first job?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Really? Is the food that bad?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Oh no. Not at all.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: We need more bread and some baked lasa– uh,
lasagne. Hi.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: as he wipes his hands</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: stove, pointing a</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: And the quail is responsible for the quail
eggs.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Well, let’s hope so.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Here, I stole you a couple of extra
clams.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Ah!</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Now.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Incidentally, I’m David Tolchin.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Oh, uh, April Knox. Hi.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: and squeezing past</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You’re Holly.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: David as she wipes</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Now I’m going to tell you the truth. I really
came in here because I was bored stiff by the party.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: What makes you think we’re more
interesting?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Actually, I’m going to listen to Aida, if I’m
not getting in your way.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: No…no. No–</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Not at all.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: We saw, um, Pavarotti, eh, uh, in Ernani at
the Met, and I cried…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: still on his watch as</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Oh, I-I-I go limp in the last scene in La
Traviata. Limp.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Me, too. I have a private box at the Met. I
bring my little bottle of wine, I open it, I sit there and I watch and I
cry. It’s disgusting.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Oh, what, what do you do?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’m an architect.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Wha– What kind of things do you build?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Are you really interested?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What time do you get off?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Wow, it’s the red one?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Oh, it’s magnificent!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: It’s terrific!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: back and forth from the buildings to</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: And in the material. That’s…that’s unpolished
red granite.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Oh, is that what it is?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Uh–</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: I-i-it has an o-organic quality, you
know.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: It’s almost…almost, uhhh, entirely wholly
interdependent, if you know what I mean. I-I… I can’t put it into words.
The important thing is-is-is it-it breathes.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You know, April, people pass by vital
structures in this city all the time, and they never take the time to
appreciate them. I get the feeling you tune in to your environment.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Oh–</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Oh, it’s really important.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: What are your favorite buildings, David?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You want to see some?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Well, let’s do it.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Oh, it’s just so romantic. I just want to put
on a long gown…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: …and open the French doors and go on the
balcony –</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: It’s French, though. It really is.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: It feels like you’re in France.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It-it is. It’s romantic.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: And it’s got a handsome partner sitting right
beside it.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: They fit right in together. And your eye goes
along, lulled into complacency, and then…</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: That’s just –</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Look at this.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: That’s disgusting!</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: …a monstrosity! Who would do that?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: It’s really terrible.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It’s really sad.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: And it ruins everything else.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It does.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Well…we have seen a lot of stuff today,
though.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: A lot of works.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Maybe we should start thinking about going
home, huh?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Fast.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Oh, geez, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: women as he walks around the car to the</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Uh –</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Oh, gee, I don’t know. Um…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Well, I live downtown.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Yeah, I, we both live downtown.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Uh…</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: It depends on what way you want to go.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Well, wait. You know what? I know.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Uh…</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: If…well, if we took the, if we took Fifth,
then-then-then we’d get to your house first, yeah?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: We could…we could do that.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Right. Yeah, but Fifth is so jammed, isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Well, sometimes, some, uh…</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: I mean, it’s jammed. If we went… um…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Y-you live in Chelsea, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Well, I-I guess if you live in Chelsea,
that’s probably first.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Oh, okay.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: And then, uh, April…huh?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Naturally I get taken home first. Well,
obviously he prefers April. Of course I was so tongue-tied all night. I
can’t believe I said that about the Guggenheim. My stupid little
roller-skating joke. I should never tell jokes. Mom can tell ’em and
Hannah, but I kill ’em. Where did April come up with that stuff about
Adolph Loos and terms like “organic form”? Well, naturally. She went to
Brandeis.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: But I don’t think she knows what she’s
talking about. Could you believe the way she was calling him David?
“Yes, David. I feel that way, too, David. What a marvelous space,
David.” I hate April. She’s pushy.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Now they’ll dump me and she’ll invite him up.
I blew it. And I really like him a lot. Oh, screw it. I’m not gonna get
all upset. I’ve got reading to do tonight. You know, maybe I’ll get into
bed early. I’ll turn to a movie and take an extra Seconal.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Oh, my goodness!</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Oh, Elliot!</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Well, I’m-I’m looking for a bookstore.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Oh, what, in this section of town?</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Yes. Yeah, I-I’m kill–</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: You’re out looking here?</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Well, yes, I’m killing time. I have a client
near here and I…I’m quite early.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Ohhhh!</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: How about you?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Oh. Well, I live–</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Oh, yes! You live near here, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Yes, I do.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Where are you headed?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Oh, I was just going to my AA meeting.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Oh, my goodness. Well, why do you still go
to those? You never tough alcohol.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Well, listen, you didn’t know me before
Frederick. I’d…I’d start with a beer at about ten in the morning, and…go
on.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Oh. You must have been, uh, very
unhappy.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Yeah, unhappy and fat. And I still find the
meetings very comforting, you know.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: I’ll never understand it. You’re so bright
and charming and beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Oh, God.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: I think to myself what problems could she
possibly have?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Don’t let me get started on my childhood. Oh,
you know what? There is a bookstore.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: A couple of blocks from here. If you don’t know
about it, you should. You’d really love it.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Yeah, you would.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: moment, then gesturing</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Yeah, sure.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Isn’t this great? They have everything
here.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Yes, it’s-it’s wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: What book did you want to buy?</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: What? Book?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Your book? You wanted to buy a book?</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Oh, book? Oh, no, I… I’m killing time. I…I-I
just, uh, w-want to browse, uh…</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Well, you sure picked the right place. I mean,
you can stay here all afternoon, not buy anything and just read.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Unless, of course, if-if you had some time,
I mean, we could get some coffee.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: No, I don’t have time.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: No, no. I-I-I understand completely. No
problem. Y-you’re busy. I-I-I…</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: You seem tense. Is everything all right? You
feel okay?</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: No! No…</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Uh, yes!</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: momentarily, hidden</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Everything’s okay?</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Yeah. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: I’m…all right.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: momentarily, hidden by another shelf as</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Fine. Oh, we went to the Caravaggio exhibition
at the Met. It’s such a treat to go through a museum with Frederick. I
mean…you learn so much. Do you like Caravaggio?</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Oh, yes. Who doesn’t? Look!</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: e.e. cummings. I’d like to get you this.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Oh, no, I can’t let you get me that. That’s too
much.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: the shelf and browsing</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: No, I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: book, looking at the</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Uh, uh, this is great. I mean, I love e.e.
cummings, but I can’t let you get this.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Yes, I’d…I-I-I’d love, I’d love to get you
this.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Well, sure.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: And-and maybe, um…maybe we could discuss it
sometime.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Well, thanks a lot.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Thanks for showing me the bookstore. Perhaps
you could, uh, take me to an AA meeting sometime. Uh…uh, I’d love to see
what goes on.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Well, yeah, yeah. You’d love it. It’s really
entertaining. You’d have a good time. I know you would.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: And, uh, d-don’t forget the poem on page a
hundred and twelve. It reminded me of you.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Really? Well…</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Page a hundred and twelve.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Bye.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Bye.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: “your slightest look easily will unclose me
though I have closed myself as fingers, you open always petal by petal
myself…</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: “…as Spring opens her first rose …</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: “nobody, not even the rain, has such small
hands.”</p>
<p><strong>dr. grey</strong>: I wasn’t too happy with the results of
your ENG or your BSER either.</p>
<p><strong>dr. grey</strong>: Uh, which is why I sent you to Tomography,
which was all that stuff you saw rolling around. You see this little
gray area here?</p>
<p><strong>dr. grey</strong>: That gray area’s what I had hoped that we
wouldn’t run into. I’d like you to come in Monday morning for, uh, a CAT
scan.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: A brain scan?</p>
<p><strong>dr. grey</strong>: Mr. Sachs, let’s take one step at a time.
We won’t make any decisions until we have all the information in front
of us, all right?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Okay…take it easy. He didn’t say you had
anything. He just doesn’t like the spot on your X-ray, that’s all. It
doesn’t mean you have anything. Don’t jump to conclusions. Nothing’s
gonna happen to you. You’re in the middle of New York City. This is your
town. You’re surrounded by people and traffic and restaurants.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: I mean, God, how can you, how can you just
one day…vanish? Keep calm. You’re gonna be okay. Don’t panic.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: I’m dying! I’m dying! I know it! There’s a
spot on my lungs! All right now, take it easy, will you? It’s not on
your lungs. It’s on your ear. No, it’s the same thing, isn’t it? Oh,
jeez, I can’t sleep! Oh, God, there’s a tumor in my head the size of a
basketball! N-now I keep thinking I can feel it every time I blink! Oh,
Jesus! He-he-he wants me to do a brain scan to confirm what he already
suspects.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Look…I’ll make a deal with God. Let it just
be my ear, okay? I’ll go deaf. I’ll go deaf and blind in one eye maybe.
But I don’t want a brain operation! Once they go into my skull,
I’ll-I’ll wind up like the guy with the, with the wool cap who delivers
for the florist!</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Oh, relax, will ya? Your whole life you run
to doctors. The news is always fine. That’s not true. What about years
ago?</p>
<p><strong>dr. smith</strong>: I’m sorry to say, Mr. Sachs, that you
cannot have children.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Gee.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Is there no chance?</p>
<p><strong>dr. smith</strong>: Well, naturally, this doesn’t mean that
you can’t have a normal sex life. But Mr. Sachs’s tests indicate that he
is infertile. Small sperm volume and infertile.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: up at an offscreen Dr.</p>
<p><strong>dr. smith</strong>: I’m afraid not.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Well, I gotta get a second opinion.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: This is the second opinion.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Well, then a third opinion.</p>
<p><strong>dr. smith</strong>: I realize this is a blow. My experience
is that many very fine marriages become unstable and are destroyed by an
inability to deal with this sort of problem. I hope you won’t make too
much of it. One can adopt children, and there are various artificial
methods of fertilization.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: I’m so humiliated. I don’t know what to say.
I mean–</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Could you have ruined yourself somehow?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: How could I ruin myself? What do you mean,
ruin myself?</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: I don’t know. Excessive masturbation?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Hey, you gonna start knocking my hobbies?
Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Maybe, maybe we can adopt a child. He said
you could adopt one–</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Well, what about artificial
insemination?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: You know, where I-I-I would get implanted
from a-a donor.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: What, by a st-stranger?</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Yeah, they have these banks, you know, where
they keep them frozen.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Fro–? You want a-a defrosted kid? Is that
your idea?</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: I want to experience childbirth.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: With a, with a stranger? With a–</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Just think about it. That’s all I ask.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Oh, that was a wonderful show. I think that’s
the best show you two ever wrote.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: No, the funniest show that Mickey and I ever
did was the one we won the Emmy for.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Yeah…I-I think as, I think as far as laughs,
I mean just plain laughs, you know, that was probably the best thing
that we ever did.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Mm-hm.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: hands over her</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: We got that idea on that trip to Paris.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Hmm?</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Do you remember that summer in France?
Hannah, you had jet lag for six straight weeks.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Yeah, but it was, you know, I guess we had
fun when we were there and, you know, it’s just, I–</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Mm-hm.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Sorry. Coffee? Listen, you guys, we were–
You want some more?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Mmm.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: We-we…we had something we-we really wanted
to discuss with you.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Jeez, this is, this is, this is very
delicate and-and I only bring this up amongst friends, you know.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: as he paces behind</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: I’m all ears.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Hannah and I…can’t have any children. Now
I-I-I don’t want to get into whose fault it– It’s my fault that we can’t
and- and-and the details are too embarrassing to–</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: nervously picking at</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Yeah, I’m not so sure that I, that I like
that idea myself, anyway–</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Um, I-I didn’t really want to, you know, go
to a sperm bank or something, have some anonymous donor. I-I just, you
know, I-I-I wouldn’t want that.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Right. We felt that if we were gonna do it,
that we would like somebody who we knew and who we liked and who was
warm and bright and…</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: And you can say no… you know. Feel free to
say no. W-we realize it has all kinds of implications.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Yeah, but the-the point that, uh, that we’re
making here is that we need some sperm.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Gee. Well… My first reaction after the
initial shock is, uh, flattered that you would ask me.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Yeah, well, I would be the father. You would
just have to masturbate into a little cup.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: I can handle that.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Carol and Norman on</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Gosh, listen. I’ve gotta tell you the truth
here. I’m a little uneasy about this.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Carol, I know it’s a lot to ask.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Well…I feel for you. I do. I…I’m gonna cry.
You want my husband to have a child with you?</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Ye– D-d-d-don’t answer now. Just, you know,
take it home and think about it for a while.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: I gave blood before and, uh… clothing to the
poor.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Okay, Norman, listen, I really want to talk
about this at home. I think it’s a matter for your analyst…and mine.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: And maybe my lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: You know, we-we understand completely if,
you know, if you feel you’d-you’d rather not. I didn’t mean to spoil the
evening. Now let’s move on to another topic.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: So you had my ex-partner’s baby. Twins.
Maybe that did cause some trouble, but I think we were drifting apart
anyhow. Now instead of man and wife we’re just good friends. Boy, love
is really unpredictable.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Lee, Frederick…say hello to Dusty Frye.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Hi, Dusty.</p>
<p><strong>dusty</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Dusty’s just bought a huge house in
Southampton and he’s in the process of decorating it.</p>
<p><strong>dusty</strong>: Yeah. It’s kind of a weird place, actually. A
lotta wall space.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>dusty</strong>: How ya doin’, man?</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: I told him about your work, and he’s very
excited.</p>
<p><strong>dusty</strong>: Yeah, I got an Andy Warhol. And I got a Frank
Stella, too. Oh, it’s very beautiful. Big, weird…you know. If you stare
at that Stella too long, the colors just seem to float. It’s kinda
weird.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Are you excited about becoming a collector?</p>
<p><strong>dusty</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>dusty</strong>: I got a lot more to learn, though. I really
wasn’t into art when I was a kid.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>frederick</strong>: Do you appreciate drawings?</p>
<p><strong>dusty</strong>: Yeah. Oh! Hey! Wow! She’s beautiful. But, uh,
really, I-I-I-I need something… I’m looking for something big.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Big. Frederick, show him the oils.</p>
<p><strong>frederick</strong>: They’re in the basement.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Frederick’s done this whole new series that I’m
sure you would really love.</p>
<p><strong>dusty</strong>: Well, are…are they big?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Yeah. Some of them…yeah, some of them are very
big.</p>
<p><strong>dusty</strong>: ’Cause I got a lot of wall space there.</p>
<p><strong>frederick</strong>: I don’t sell my work by the yard!</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Oh, Frederick!</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: How’s everything?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Oh, you know…I talked to Hannah this morning on
the phone, and she said that you two might be going to the country for
the weekend.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Yeah, she loves to go out in the woods.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: But I go nuts. It’s a conflict.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: I have to get my teeth cleaned this week.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Oh, that’s nice.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: pointing in the</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Oh, yeah, that’s really nice of you.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Yes. This kid, he’s earned a trillion
dollars.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: her arms around her</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: He’s got like six gold records.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: that she’s found</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: …and the man in the record shop showed me
another one that I think you’d love. It’s a… another Bach, second
movement.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Oh, you-you have that one?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: stereo, turning her</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Oh, I would love to hear it.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Oh, and Holly met a wonderful man who loves
opera. An architect.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Oh, that’s nice. I’d love to see her wind up
settled. She’s a tense one.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Isn’t that beautiful?</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: hands clasped in</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Uh…did you ever get around to e.e.
cummings?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: around her chest and looking away from</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: They have a very large gay clientele, you know,
where I get my teeth cleaned, and…all the hygienists now wear gloves
because they’re afraid of AIDS.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Oh, right.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Did you ever get around to the poem on page
a hundred and twelve?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Yes, it made me cry it was so beautiful…so
romantic.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: I want so badly to kiss her. Not here, you
idiot. You’ve got to get her alone someplace.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: But I’ve got to proceed cautiously. This is
a very delicate situation. Okay, uh…ask her if you can see her for lunch
or a drink tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: And be ready to make light of the offer if
she’s unresponsive. This has to be done very skillfully, very
diplomatically.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Did you ever read this one–?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Elliot! Don’t!</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Lee! Lee! Lee, I’m in love with you.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: What are you doing?!</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: I…I’m-I’m-I’m-I’m sorry. I have to talk to
you for… There’s so much that I want to tell you.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Elliot!</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: I have been in love with you for so
long.</p>
<p><strong>frederick</strong>: Please forget it! I don’t have any
interest in selling anything!</p>
<p><strong>dusty</strong>: I ask you if you have something with a little
puce in it, you gotta fly off the handle!</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: What’s the problem?</p>
<p><strong>frederick</strong>: drawings off his</p>
<p><strong>dusty</strong>: Well, I can’t commit to anything without
consulting her first. That’s what I have her for, okay?</p>
<p><strong>frederick</strong>: This is degrading! You don’t buy
paintings to blend in with the sofa!</p>
<p><strong>dusty</strong>: It’s not a sofa, it’s an ottoman! God, forget
it! Let’s just get outta here, Elliot.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: We’ll go.</p>
<p><strong>dusty</strong>: What a weirdo that guy is! Paranoid. What’s
the matter with you?</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Look I-I-I’ll be okay. I’ll be okay.</p>
<p><strong>dusty</strong>: It’s not that big a deal. We just didn’t hit
it off.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Now, look, you-you-you go on ahead.</p>
<p><strong>dusty</strong>: Are you okay? You look– You’re sweatin’.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Yeah. Yeah, I just-just need so- some-some
fresh air. It’s probably something I ate. I’ll-I’ll walk. You go
ahead.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: You go. Go on. Go.</p>
<p><strong>frederick</strong>: Hello? Hello? Hello?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Oh! There you are!</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: I was looking for you.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: I, I must apologize. I-I’m, I-I’m sorry. I’m
so mixed up.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Well, how do you expect me to react to such a
thing?</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Wh–, uh, I know, I know but, I am in love
with you.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Oh, don’t say those words!</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: I-I, I’m sorry. I know it’s terrible.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: hair, shaking her</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: I know! I-I-I-I, I realize.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: What do you expect me to say?</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Hannah and I are in the last stages.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Wh– She’s never said anything, and we’re very
close. She’d tell me such a thing.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Wh–, it-it-it-it, it’s so sad. She’s crazy
about me, but somewhere on the, along the line, I’ve fallen out of love
with her.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Not because of me, I hope.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Oh, no, no. Well, yes! I love you.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Oh, I can’t be the cause of anything between
you and Hannah. I jus–</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Oh, no, no, no. It, uh, it-it-it- it was
i-inevitable that Hannah and I part, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Tch, w-well, for a million reasons.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: But not over me?</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Tch, no! We were, we were both going in
different directions.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Poor Hannah.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: But-but, but how about you? Do you, do you
share any of my feelings? Or is this just an unpleasant embarrassment to
you?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: I can’t say anything!</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: W-well, please be candid. I, I-I don’t want
you to feel bad.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Yes! But I…I have certain feelings for you, but
don’t make me say anything more, all right?</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: O-o-o-okay, Lee. Okay, okay. You, you,
y-you’ve said enough. It’s my responsibility now. I will work things
out.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Look, don’t do anything on my behalf. I live
with Frederick, and Hannah and I are close.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Yes, but you, you do care about me.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Oh, Elliot, please! I can’t be a party to this!
I’m suddenly wracked with guilt just standing her talking to you on the
street!</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Your guilt is because you feel the same.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Oh, please, I have to go. I have to get my
teeth cleaned.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: I have my answer. I have my answer! I’m
walking on air!</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Hi. How’s she doing?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: I am glad to see you.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: She’s in the kitchen there. It’s the same
thing. Same thing. She promises, promises. But it’s all lies.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Don’t make it worse, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Always.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Hi, Mom. How you doing? Here, let me get you
some coffee. That’s enough of that. What triggered it?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: turns her head and</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: …and your mother was throwing herself at him
in a disgusting way, and when she found she was too old to seduce him,
that he was just embarrassed by her–</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Liar! Liar!</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Then at lunch she got drunker and drunker and
finally she became Joan Collins!</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: All my life I’ve had to put up with
insults…</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: …from this non-person, this, th- th-this
haircut that passes for a man. He could never support us. It’s a good
thing we had a talented daughter!</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: I can only hope that she was mine. With you as
her mother her father could be anybody in Actors’ Equity!</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: She’s talented…so it’s not likely she’s
yours!</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: doorway to speak to Evan, who’s already</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: You never know when she’s going to fall off
the wagon and humiliate everybody.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Here, Mom. Drink this. You know, you’re
awful. You probably were flirting.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: No! I like to joke around and have fun, and
he gets angry because I get the attention. He’s gotten sourer as he’s
gotten older, and I’ve tried to stay young…at heart.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: You promised to stay on the wagon.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: The sacrifices I’ve made because of that man.
He’s ruined me with his ego, his philandering, his– his-his-his-his
mediocrity!</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Okay, stop being so dramatic.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: He’s the one that’s made every ingenue in
stock!</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Okay, okay.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Th-th-they, they wanted me for a screen
test.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Yeah, I know, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: But I, I knew that he’d get up there and he’d
flounder around with his expensive haircuts and hairdos and clothes.
He’s all show! Now how can you act when there’s nothing inside to come
out?!</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: She was so beautiful at one time, and he was
so dashing. Both of them just full of promise and hopes that never
materialized.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: And the fights and the constant infidelities
to prove themselves…and blaming each other. It’s s-sad. They loved the
idea of having us kids, but raising us didn’t interest them much. But
it’s impossible to hold it against them. They didn’t know anything
else.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: You know, of all of us in the family, you
were the one blessed with the true gift.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: mother had placed on</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: I just had a lot of luck…from my first show,
you know? I’ve always thought Lee was the one destined for great
things.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Yes, she’s lovely, but she doesn’t have your
spark. She knows it. She worships you. She wouldn’t dare get up there on
the stage.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Now, Holly’s not shy.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: No, Holly’s game for anything. Holly takes
after me.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: True.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: I’d have been a great dope addict.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Remember this, Hannah?</p>
<p><strong>dr. brooks</strong>: Mr. Sachs, I’m afraid the news is not
good.</p>
<p><strong>dr. brooks</strong>: If I can show you exactly where the
tumor is, and why we feel that surgery would be of no use.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: It’s over. I’m face-to-face with
eternity.</p>
<p><strong>dr. brooks</strong>: …grown quite large without being
detected…</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Not later, but now. I’m so frightened I
can’t move, speak, or breathe.</p>
<p><strong>dr. brooks</strong>: Well, you’re just fine. There’s
absolutely nothing here at all. And your tests are all fine. I must
admit, I was concerned, given your symptoms. What caused this hearing
loss in one ear, I guess we’ll never really know for sure. But whatever
it was, it’s certainly not anything serious at all. I’m very
relieved.</p>
<p><strong>gail</strong>: What do you mean you’re quitting? Why? The
news is good! You don’t have canc–the thing.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Do you realize what a thread we’re all
hanging by?</p>
<p><strong>gail</strong>: Mickey, you’re off the hook. You should be
celebrating.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: the front of his</p>
<p><strong>gail</strong>: Yeah…but you’re not dying!</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: No, I’m not dying now, but, but you know,
when I ran out of the hospital, I, I was so thrilled because they told
me I was going to be all right. And I’m running down the street, and
suddenly I stop, ’cause it hit me, all right, so, you know, I’m not
going to go today. I’m okay. I’m not going to go tomorrow. But
eventually, I’m going to be in that position.</p>
<p><strong>gail</strong>: You’re just realizing this now?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Well, I don’t realize it now, I know it all
the time, but, but I managed to stick it in the back of my mind…</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: …because it-it’s a very horrible thing to…
think about!</p>
<p><strong>gail</strong>: Yeah. What?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Can I tell you something? Can I tell you a
secret?</p>
<p><strong>gail</strong>: as she walks around</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: A week ago, I bought a rifle.</p>
<p><strong>gail</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: I went into a store, I bought a rifle. I was
gonna… You know, if they told me that I had a tumor, I was going to kill
myself. The only thing that mighta stopped me, might’ve, is my parents
would be devastated. I would, I woulda had to shoot them, also, first.
And then, I have an aunt and uncle, I would have… You know, it would
have been a bloodbath.</p>
<p><strong>gail</strong>: Tch, well, you know, eventually it, it is
going to happen to all of us.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Yes, but doesn’t that ruin everything for
you? That makes everything…</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: …you know it, it just takes the pleasure out
of everything. I mean, you’re gonna die, I’m gonna die, the audience is
gonna die, the network’s gonna– The sponsor. Everything!</p>
<p><strong>gail</strong>: I know, I know, and your hamster.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>gail</strong>: Listen, kid, I think you snapped your cap.</p>
<p><strong>gail</strong>: Maybe you need a few weeks in Bermuda, or
something. Or go to a whorehouse! No?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: I can’t stay on this show. I gotta get some
answers. Otherwise I’m telling you, I’m going to do something
drastic.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: I thought you weren’t coming.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: I almost didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: her shoulder, wanting</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: I didn’t sleep all night.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: away, gesturing to</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: What are we doing, meeting in a hotel room?
It’s terrible, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: I-I couldn’t think where to invite you
without taking risks.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: I promised myself I wouldn’t let this happen
till you were living alone. I was so torn when you called.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: I’ve wanted to call you everyday since I
first told you how I felt.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: I resisted so many times. Don’t think badly
of me.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: This is not an easy situation.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: I know it isn’t.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: That was just perfect. You’ve ruined me for
anyone else.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: I don’t want anyone else ever to have
you.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: I was so worried I wouldn’t compare with
Hannah.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Oh, my God.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: You really do have those thoughts, don’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Oh, all the time.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: I know she must be a really passionate
person.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Yes, she’s, she’s very warm, but, but
it-it’s me that wants to be giving to you. I-I-I want to do things for
you. Hannah doesn’t need me as much. I’m being presumptuous. Not that
you need me.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: I want you to take care of me… And I love when
you do things to me.</p>
<p><strong>frederick</strong>: You’re late.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Lucy and I kept talking, and I didn’t realize
how late it had gotten.</p>
<p><strong>frederick</strong>: You missed a very dull TV show about
Auschwitz. More gruesome film clips…and more puzzled intellectuals
declaring their mystification over the systematic murder of
millions.</p>
<p><strong>frederick</strong>: slightly in Lee’s</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: I have a little headache from this weather.</p>
<p><strong>frederick</strong>: It’s been ages since I sat in front of
the TV… just changing channels to find something.</p>
<p><strong>frederick</strong>: You see the whole culture…Nazis,
deodorant salesman, wrestlers…beauty contests, the talk show… Can you
imagine the level of a mind that watches wrestling? Hmm? But the worst
are the fundamentalist preachers…third- rate con men, telling the poor
suckers that watch them that they speak for Jesus…and to please send in
money. Money, money, money! If Jesus came back, and saw what’s going on
in his name, he’d never stop throwing up.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Oh, God, Frederick, could you please lighten
up?! I’m really not in the mood to hear a review of contemporary society
again.</p>
<p><strong>frederick</strong>: You know, you’ve been very nervous
lately.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: I can’t take this anymore.</p>
<p><strong>frederick</strong>: I’m just trying to complete an education
I started on you five years ago.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: I’m not your pupil. I was, but I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>frederick</strong>: When you leave the nest, I just want you
to be ready to face the real world.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Frederick, we’re going to have to make some
changes.</p>
<p><strong>frederick</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Oh, you know what. I’m suffocating!</p>
<p><strong>frederick</strong>: hands clasped in</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Yes, we’re going to have this conversation
again. I…I have to leave. I have to move out.</p>
<p><strong>frederick</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Because I have to!</p>
<p><strong>frederick</strong>: What are you going to use for money?!</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: I don’t know. I thought, maybe I’d move in with
my parents for a while.</p>
<p><strong>frederick</strong>: Tch, oh. I always told you you would
leave me. But…does it have to be now?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Well, maybe it’ll only be temporary, but I ha–I
have to try.</p>
<p><strong>frederick</strong>: his hands and looking</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Frederick’s hands</p>
<p><strong>frederick</strong>: Oh, yes, you have!</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>frederick</strong>: You’ve been with someone!</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Stop accusing me!</p>
<p><strong>frederick</strong>: I’m too smart, Lee! You can’t fool me!
You’re turning all red!</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Leave me alone!</p>
<p><strong>frederick</strong>: Oh, Christ! What’s wrong with you?!</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>frederick</strong>: Oh, couldn’t you say something? You have
to slither around behind my back!</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: I’m saying it now!</p>
<p><strong>frederick</strong>: So you met somebody else?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: But you, God, you knew that was going to happen
sooner or later. I can’t live like this!</p>
<p><strong>frederick</strong>: in the bathroom, his</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: things in her purse,</p>
<p><strong>frederick</strong>: But who? Where did you meet him?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: It doesn’t make a difference! I have to move
out!</p>
<p><strong>frederick</strong>: You are, you are my only connection to
the world!</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Oh, God, that’s too much responsibility for me.
It’s not fair! I want a less complicated life, Frederick. I want a
husband, maybe even a child before it’s too late.</p>
<p><strong>frederick</strong>: Jesus…Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Oh, God, I don’t even know what I want.</p>
<p><strong>frederick</strong>: Oh…</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Tch, oh, what do you get out of me, anyway? I
mean… it’s not sexual anymore. It’s certainly not intellectual. I mean,
you’re so superior to me in every way that–</p>
<p><strong>frederick</strong>: Please, don’t patronize me!</p>
<p><strong>frederick</strong>: God! I should have married you years ago
when you wanted to! I should have agreed.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Oh, God, don’t you know it never would have
worked?</p>
<p><strong>frederick</strong>: I told you, one day you would leave me…
for a younger man. I–</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: What passion today with Lee. She’s a
volcano. It was a totally fulfilling experience… Just as I dreamed it
would be. That’s what it was. It was like living out a dream…a great
dream. Now I feel very good and cozy being here next to Hannah. There’s
something very lovely and real about Hannah. She gives me a very deep
feeling of being part of something. She’s a wonderful woman…and I
betrayed her. She came into my empty life and changed it…and I paid her
back by banging her sister in a hotel room. God, I’m despicable. What a
cruel and shallow thing to do. I have to call her now and tell her what
we did was crazy. It can’t ever happen again. I’m not that kind of
man…and I value Hannah too much. I love my wife. Now I’ve betrayed her.
Oh, God!</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Where’re you going?</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: I’ve, uh…gotta find, gotta get a phone
number in my desk. I forgot to phone Mel Kaufman.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: It’s so late.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Yeah, I know. I-I can’t believe I
forgot.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: What if he answers? I’ll hang up. I’ll tell
her we can’t communicate until I terminate my marriage. It’s
immoral.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Then, time will pass. I won’t call, and
she’ll get the idea. I gotta stop this before I get in too deep. I’d
rather hurt Lee a little, than destroy Hannah.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: It’s one-thirty. She…she can’t have a
conversation with me…with him around. I’m getting hysterical. I’ll call
her first thing in the morning. I’ll call her at six. Frederick goes
jogging at six, yeah, she’ll be alone. And I’ll, I’ll call her and nip
it in the bud.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: I’ve got it! I’ve got it! I’ve got it!
Hello? Mel!</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: I would have hung up if you hadn’t answered and
I promise I won’t ever do this again, but I just had to tell you, I feel
very close to you tonight. Very, very close. Good night.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Millions of books written on every
conceivable subject by all these great minds, and, and in the end, none
of ’em knows anything more about the big questions of life than I do.
Ss–I read Socrates. You know, n-n-n–, this guy used to kn-knock off
little Greek boys. What the hell’s he got to teach me? And, and
Nietzsche with his, with his Theory of Eternal Recurrence. He said that
the life we live, we’re gonna live over and over again the exact same
way for eternity. Great. That means I, uh, I’ll have to sit through the
Ice Capades again. Tch. It’s not worth it.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: And, and Freud, another great pessimist.
Jeez, I was in analysis for years. Nothing happened. My poor analyst got
so frustrated. The guy finally put in a salad bar.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Oh! Look at all these people jogging…trying
to stave off the inevitable decay of the body. Boy it’s so sad what
people go through with their-their stationary bike and their exercise
and their… …Oh! Look at this one! Poor thing. My God, she has to tote
all that fat around. Maybe the poets are right. Maybe love is the only
answer.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Shh–Of course, I was in love with Hannah.
That didn’t work out too well. I even took her sister out. Remember
that?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Remember years ago when Hannah and I got
divorced and she fixed me up with her sister Holly?</p>
<p><strong>the 39 steps</strong>: “I want to be like you I said I’m
going to fit into your group…”</p>
<p><strong>the 39 steps</strong>: “I don’t wanna be different Said I’m
gonna be just like you Because I’m gonna buy the records That they play
on radio…</p>
<p><strong>the 39 steps</strong>: “I’m gonna dance at clubs Gonna do
just what I’m told Because I’m bleedin’ now And I’m bleedin’ now I wanna
slip, slip, slip, slip, slip Into the crowd I wanna slip, slip, slip,
slip, slip Into the crowd…”</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Oh, why are you making those faces?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: I can’t hear you. I can’t hear anything.
I’m, I’m, I’m, I’m gonna lose hearing in my ear! I’m–</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: gesturing to the</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: I, I, my ears are experiencing a meltdown! I
can’t hear anything.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Look, can’t you feel the energy? It’s
tangible energy! The room’s alive with positive vibrations!</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Holly, I’m frightened! I’m–After they sing…
they’re gonna take hostages! Now let’s–</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Don’t, no, please. Will you– No, don’t…</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: You want some?</p>
<p><strong>the 39 steps</strong>: background while</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: I don’t. No. No.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Come on, Mickey. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: But, no, you’ve been doing that all night!
You’re gonna…you’re gonna burn a hole in your… You’re gonna develop a
third nostril! Really, don’t, please.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Can we, can we go?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: offscreen hand, bopping her head to</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: My–uh…</p>
<p><strong>the 39 steps</strong>: “…Gonna buy the records That they play
on the radio…”</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: I love songs about extraterrestrial life,
don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Not when they’re sung by
extraterrestrials.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Oh, well, I cannot communicate with you! I,
you know, I never realized you were such a tightass.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: I can’t understand you. Your sisters, both
sisters have such good taste in music. I don’t know where you went, went
wrong.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Do you mind? I’m-I’m my own person.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Can I take you someplace to hear something
nice?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Eh, Mickey, it’s getting late.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Now come on, you’re be–, ’cause you’re being
angry at me.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: I’m not angry! You know, you, well, you don’t
believe in ESP, you don’t like rock music, you won’t get high… It’s like
I’m dating Cardinal Cooke!</p>
<p><strong>bobby short</strong>: “Why am I Just as reckless as a child?
Why am I Like a racehorse running wild? Why am I In a state of ecstasy?
The reason is ‘cause something’s Happened to me I’m in love again And
the spring is comin’…”</p>
<p><strong>bobby short</strong>: “I’m in love again Hear my heart
strings strummin’ I’m in love again And the hymn they’re hummin’ Is
those cuddle-up huddle-up blues I’m in love again And I can’t rise above
it…”</p>
<p><strong>bobby short</strong>: “I’m in love again And I love, love,
love it.”</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Thanks for a swell time.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Well, if you didn’t like it, you didn’t like
it, but you didn’t have to talk while the guy was singing.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: I was so bored!</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Yeah, that’s tough! You don’t deserve Cole
Porter. You should stay with those groups that look like they’re gonna
stab their mother!</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: At least I’m open to new concepts!</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: And you don’t have to snort cocaine at the
table all the time! What do you, what do you do? Carry a kilo around in
your purse?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: This crowd wouldn’t know the difference!
They’re embalmed!</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Jesus… I’m glad Hannah got us together. You
know, she’s got a great instinct for people. Really.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Oh, look, I’m sorry it didn’t work out.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Yeah. Me, too.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: You know, it’s probably my fault. I’ve been a
little depressed lately.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Right. Yeah. I had a…</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: God!</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: …I had a great time tonight, really. It was
like the Nuremberg Trials.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Oh, I’ll see myself home!</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Yeah, it was quite an evening. Holly with
her cocaine… She should have been wearing a gold shovel around her neck.
Tch, she was polymorphously insensitive, I think. Too bad, too… ’cause,
you know, I always had a little crush on her.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Oh, you just have to read the instructions.
I mean, you just set one of these things and you can take, you can take
pictures underwater.</p>
<p><strong>child 1</strong>: Can I try it?</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Sure! Yeah. When we get to the country,
we’ll try it in the lake.</p>
<p><strong>child 1</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Okay?</p>
<p><strong>child 2</strong>: Can I go?</p>
<p><strong>child 1</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Yeah! Okay.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Are you in a bad mood?</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: I don’t know. Um…I’m just antsy.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Yes. I know. The last few weeks, you haven’t
been yourself. And tonight at, tonight at dinner, you, you were kind of
curt with me.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Was I?</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Yes, you were. A-and when I, when I brought
up the idea of having a baby, you just, you jumped down my throat.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Well, I-I don’t think it’s a very good
idea.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Because it’s the last thing in the world we
need right now.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Why do you say that? Is there something
wrong?</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Well, tell me. Should I be worried?</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: But, you got four children!</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: I want one with you.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Well…I-I think we should wait till things
settle.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: But what do, what do you– what’s that mean?
W-w-we’ve been, we’ve been married for four years. How settled can
things get?</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: You know, y-you have some very set plans on
how your life should be structured. A-a house, uh, kids, certain
schools, a h–, a home in Connecticut. I-it’s all very…preconceived.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Yeah, but I…uh–I thought you needed that.
When-when-when we met, you said your life was chaos.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: I-I-I know, but there’s got to be some give
and take.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Oh, let’s not–I, I don’t know what the hell
I’m talking about.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Are you angry with me?</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Do you feel, um…are you disenchanted with
our marriage?</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: I didn’t say that.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Are you in love with someone else?</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: My God! Wha-what is this? The Gestapo?
No.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Well, what? What, wh-what are you not
telling me?</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: What kind of interrogation… Su- supposing I
said yes? I-I-I am disenchanted. I am in love with someone else.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Are you?</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: for a beat before</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: What, you, of c– What are you talking about?
Of course not. I’d be destroyed!</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: For Chrissakes, stop torturing her. Tell her
you want out and get it over with. You’re in love with her sister. You
didn’t do it on purpose. Be honest. It’s always the best way.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Look, can I help you? If you’re suffering
over something, will you share it with me?</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Hannah, you know how much I love you. I
ought to have my head examined. I don’t deserve you.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: You know, I just want to look so good, but I
don’t want to seem, you know, like I’m overdressed. You know what I’m
saying?</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Oh, no, not at all.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Well, how about this?</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Well, I, I really like that. I think that’s
a pretty color on you.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Did you ever think you’d be helping me buy
something to wear to the opera?</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Nuh-uh…but I think it’s great. I can’t wait
to meet him.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: He’s married…</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Oh-oh.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: …and his wife’s, uh, in and out of
institutions. She’s schizophrenic.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Sometimes she’s terrific…</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Oooo.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: …and then she just breaks down. And he has
this sweet daughter…and when she goes to college next year, he’s going
to split permanently. I mean…</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Oh?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: …he’s really paid his dues, but…then she
helped put him through architecture school, you know, so…</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: glancing at her sister for a moment</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Well, I think he was dying to open up. It’s
so sad. Now…what should I wear to my audition?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: I’ve got a singing audition for a Broadway
musical. Of course, I’ll never get it.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Singing?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Yeah, can you believe it?</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Well, I mean, why not? You know, wh-what have
I got to lose? Uh…</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Well, no…I-I know, I just, uh… No, I-I, eh,
you know, I, I didn’t, I didn’t know you sung.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Well, you think everybody in m- musicals
sings so well?</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: No! No, I, eh, it’s just that they sing.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Well…you know, uh…I sing a little, I
mean…</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Ohh!</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: You know.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: I know, no– I know.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: chuckling self-</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: No, I’m sorry. No, I didn’t mean that. No, I
didn’t mean that.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Uh, you know, I think I can fake my way
through a song.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: around the store, pulling up her</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Easily.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: W-why? You don’t think it’s realistic?</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: No, I didn’t, I, that’s no. No, I- I-I, no,
I-I just… hate to see you put yourself in a position where, where you
get hurt, you know. You know, you know how you take…</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: at some clothes</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Yeah. Well, maybe I’ll get it.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: I hope.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Boy, you really know how to cut me down.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: What? You don’t, don’t be so sensitive.
Can’t I say anything?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Tch, well, I sing! For Chrissake, Hannah, you
heard me sing!</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Okay! Okay. I– What happened? You know, we
were having a really nice time, a-and suddenly, everything went to bad
feeling.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Nobody but you can do that to me. I don’t
know why.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Look, everything’s going your way.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: You’re right. I’m happy. Why must I let my
insecurities spoil everything?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: “This year’s fancies Are passing
fancies…”</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: singing, barely</p>
<p><strong>producer</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>producer</strong>: It was very nice.</p>
<p><strong>assistant #1</strong>: Terrific.</p>
<p><strong>stage manager</strong>: overlapping the</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: “Someday When I’m awfully low When the world
is cold I will get a glow Just thinking of you And the way you look
Tonight…”</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: I’m telling you, you sounded great. You, uh,
you may be surprised.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Oh, I’m just glad we have a catering job this
week. I’m real low on money.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Yeah, we have Mr. Morris Levine’s eightieth
birthday party on Riverside Drive…or Riverside Memorial Chapel,
depending on his health.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Oh, uh, listen, David called me up.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Uh, David called me last night, and he wants
to take me to the opera. I didn’t know what to say.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: You’re joking.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: No, he called late last night.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: I, uh, I’m very surprised.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: He wants to take me to see Rigoletto.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: And you, you-you’re going?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Well, I-I-I didn’t know what to say. First I
said no, but then, he pressed it. He said, uh, he’d taken you once and
he really wanted to invite me.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: But I’m seeing him.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: I know. I said that, but… he said it was
something he really felt like doing.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Gee, um… I…I don’t know what to say.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Look, it’s just an evening at the opera. Did
I, I-I do wrong in accepting?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>father flynn</strong>: Now why do you think that you would
like to convert to Catholicism?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Well, uh, because, y-you know, I gotta have
something to believe in, otherwise life is just meaningless.</p>
<p><strong>father flynn</strong>: I understand. But why did you make the
decision to choose the Catholic faith?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Tch. Well, y-you know…first of all, because
it’s a very beautiful religion. It’s very well structured. Now I’m
talking now, incidentally, about the-the, uh, against-school- prayer,
pro-abortion, anti-nuclear wing.</p>
<p><strong>father flynn</strong>: So at the moment you don’t believe in
God.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: No. A-a-and I-I want to. You know, I’m-I’m
willing to do anything. I’ll, you know, I’ll dye Easter eggs if it
works. I-I need some evidence. I gotta have some proof. Uh, you know, i-
i-if I can’t believe in God then I don’t think life is worth living.</p>
<p><strong>father flynn</strong>: It means making a very big leap.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Yes, well, can-can you help me?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Why? Oh, my God!</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: I don’t understand. I thought that you would
be happy.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: How can we be happy?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Well, because I never thought of God in my
life. Now I’m giving it serious thought.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: But Catholicism? Why not your own
people?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: kitchen door to his</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: You’re gonna believe in Jesus Christ?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: I know it sounds funny, but I’m gonna
try.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: But why? We raised you as a Jew.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: So, just ’cause I was born that way… You
know, I’m old enough to make a mature decision.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: But why Jesus Christ? Why, for instance,
shouldn’t you become a Buddhist?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: A Bud–? That’s totally alien to me. Look,
you’re getting on in years, right? Aren’t you afraid of dying?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Why should I be afraid?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Oh! ’Cause you won’t exist!</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: That thought doesn’t terrify you?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Who thinks about such nonsense? Now I’m
alive. When I’m dead, I’ll be dead.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: I don’t understand. Aren’t you
frightened?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Of what? I’ll be unconscious.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Yeah, I know. But never to exist again!</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Well, it certainly doesn’t look
promising.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Who knows what’ll be?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: I’ll either be unconscious or I won’t. If
not, I’ll deal with it then. I’m not gonna worry now about what’s gonna
be when I’m unconscious.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Mom, come out!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Of course there’s a God, you idiot! You
don’t believe in God?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: But if there’s a God, then wh-why is there
so much evil in the world? What– Just on a simplistic level. Why-why
were there Nazis?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Tell him, Max.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: How the hell do I know why there were Nazis?
I don’t know how the can opener works.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Hi. Where’s Holly?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Hi. She’s auditioning for a television
commercial. She said she’s gonna be a little late.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Oh, yeah? How’s she doing?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: through the</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: scarf, still on the</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: …’cause every time I try to be helpful, you
know, sh-she gets so defensive.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Oh, Hannah, she’s-she’s just embarrassed in
front of you, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: So how are you?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Oh, me, I’m okay.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Do you miss Frederick?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: I can’t believe Elliot and I can’t think of
someone nice for you to go out with, you know–</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: voice slightly higher-pitched as she</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: I’m okay.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: You know, how’s everything? You doing okay?
How’s Frederick? I mean, Elliot.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Y-yeah.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Oh, he’s fine. He’s-he’s, I guess he’s fine.
I don’t know. He’s been kinda moody lately, the last few months.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Yeah. I-I don’t know what’s wrong with him.
He’s just…kind of distant and difficult.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Oh…</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: I’ve been trying to talk to him about it. He
says everything’s fine, but I don’t know. Automatically, you know, I
leap to the worst conclusions.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: I mean, I don’t know, he’s seeing someone
else or something, but…</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Oh, no! I mean, everyone thinks things like
that.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Hey, hi!</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Well, I just came from an audition…</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: …which I did not get.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Awwww…</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: So what’s new?</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Boy–</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: They said I was too offbeat looking, whatever
the hell that means.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Oh, what do they know?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Thanks. But guess who was there
auditioning?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: April?</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Oh, gosh.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: You got it.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: I was very polite. I maintained my poise. I
said hello.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Hmm. I never trusted April, you know. She has
eyes in the back of her head.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Yeah, well, she and an architect are now a
very definite item, which I still cannot believe.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Hmm.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Oh, God…</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Yeah, although it’s put an end to the
Stanislavski Catering Company. Which is why I have to speak to you. And…
you’re gonna get impatient, but…I have to borrow some more money.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Well, that…th-that’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: cigarette in one hand, her matches in</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: I’ve picked up a lot about dramatic structure
from doing my scenes in acting class.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Well, that-that’s good. It just, uh…it just
seems to me that-that six months or a year, if-if you spent it more
productively…</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: camera still focused</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Well, I don’t know. We’d uh, uh, um… Didn’t
Mom mention there was something…something at the Museum of
Broadcasting?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Yeah, that’s clerical.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: No. She, didn’t she say it was, um…she said
it was in the publicity department. That-that can lead to other
things.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Boy, I knew you’d be discouraging.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: I’m not! I’m not! I’m trying to be helpful.
A person doesn’t just say one day, “Okay, now-now I’m finished as an
actress. Now I’m a writer.” I mean–</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Yeah, you mean not at my age.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Oh, please! We all came to have lunch, didn’t
we?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Yeah, okay, right. Forget it. What’s to
eat?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Boy…Holly…Holly.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: I just want a salad. You really think I’m a
loser, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: What do–? You’re being ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: You are, Holly. Stop it.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: You treat me like a loser.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: You never have any faith in my plans. You
always undercut my enthusiasm.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Not so! No. I think I’ve been very
supportive. I’ve…I try to give you honest, constructive advice.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Hmm!</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: I’m-I’m always happy to help you
financially. I think I’ve gone out of my way to-to introduce you to
interesting single men. There’s nothing I would–</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Uh, losers! All losers!</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: You’re too demanding.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: You know, I could always tell what you
thought of me by the type of men you fixed me up with!</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: You’re crazy! That’s not true.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Hey, Hannah, I know I’m mediocre.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: looking as if she’s</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Oh, now–</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: She’s going through a really rough time right
now.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Why are you so upset?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: You know, you’ve been picking on her ever since
she came in here. Now just leave her alone for a while! I’m just
suffocating.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: puzzled, reacting to</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Look. Listen. Listen. You want to write?
Write.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Write! Let’s just not talk about it
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Take…take a year. Take six months. Whatever
you want. Who knows? Maybe you’ll, maybe you’ll be sitting with a good
play.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: What’s the matter? What’s the matter with
you? You look pale. You okay?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: I’m-I’m okay. Yeah, I-I-I, you know, I…I’m
just, um, I got dizzy all of a sudden. I’m-I’m…I have a headache.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: forehead, looking</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: I-I can’t seem to take action. I’m-I’m like,
uh, Hamlet unable to kill his uncle.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: I want Lee, but I can’t harm Hannah. And in
no other area am I a procrastinator.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Meanwhile…Lee has no direction. She’s taking
courses at Columbia…but just randomly.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: I try not to call her, but then she calls me
and then…I call and…we try to resist meeting, but…once in a while we
meet. Sometimes we argue because I can’t break up my marriage. Sometimes
we wind up making love and…we both feel terrible.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: But it’s my fault.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: For all my education, accomplishments, and
so-called wisdom…I can’t fathom my own heart.</p>
<p><strong>krishna leader</strong>: What makes you interested in
becoming a Hare Krishna?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Well, I’m not saying that I want to join or
anything, but…but I know you guys believe in reincarnation, you know, so
it interests me.</p>
<p><strong>krishna leader</strong>: Yeah, well, what’s your
religion?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Well, I was born Jewish, you know, but, uh,
but last winter I tried to become a Catholic and…it didn’t work for me.
I-I studied and I tried and I gave it everything, but, you know,
Catholicism for me was die now, pay later, you know. And I just couldn’t
get with it. And I, and I wanted to, you know.</p>
<p><strong>krishna leader</strong>: You’re afraid of dying?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Well…yeah, naturally. Aren’t you? I– L-let
me ask you, reincarnation, does that mean my soul would pass to another
human being, or would I come back as a moose or an aardvark or
something?</p>
<p><strong>krishna leader</strong>: literature over the</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>krishna leader</strong>: …read it over, and think about
it.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Well, okay. Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>krishna leader</strong>: You’re welcome. Hare Krishna.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Who are you kidding? You’re gonna be a
Krishna? You’re gonna shave your head and put on robes and dance around
at airports? You’ll look like Jerry Lewis. Oh, God, I’m so
depressed.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: The nights are really getting cooler. Summer
went so quickly. Soon it’ll be fall. My literature professor really
likes me. It was fun being out with him last night. Funny. I feel like
I’m betraying Elliot…but that’s ridiculous. Why shouldn’t I see Doug?
Elliot’s not free. Just go one step at a time. Let’s see what the next
few months bring.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Hannah? Hi. Listen, um, you’ll be happy to
know that your money has not gone completely to waste… No, I have an
actual first rough draft of something I wrote… Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, well, I
showed it to Lee, and she gave me some good pointers. And, um, listen,
I’m pretty near where you live. I wonder if I could just drop it
off…and, you know, when you have time, some time, read it, an-and we’ll
talk when I come over at Thanksgiving. Okay? All right. Okay. Oh, wait,
wait. Listen. Listen. I think Lee met an interesting guy at Columbia…
Yeah. Yeah, well, he sounds really nice… Yeah. Okay. All right. Well,
we’ll talk at Thanksgiving. Bye-bye.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Now, here…here’s a song that Norma sang on
that trip we made up to the show in Buffalo. And, oh, was she beautiful
that night!</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Thank you, honey. Oh, yes, you were, dear.
Don’t you remember that night? She was so beautiful…she was so beautiful
that when men saw her walking along the streets, they’d drive their cars
right up on the sidewalk.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Isn’t that right, honey, eh?</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: A slight exaggeration.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: But only slight.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: You’ve been very cold to me tonight.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Is something wrong?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Oh, not here. There are too many people
around.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Hey, Hannah? You know, I think Lee is really
serious about her new boyfriend. Yeah, eh, from what I understand he
sounds really nice.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: I’m so happy for her. I think she’s in
love.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Hey, what’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: celery out and slamming the</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: My script?</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: It’s obviously based on Elliot and me.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Oh, so loosely.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: No, not “Oh, so loosely”! Real specifically!
Is that how you see us?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Well–</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Can I, can I not accept gestures and
feelings from people? Do I, do I put people off?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Well, it’s a made-up story.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: No, it’s real exact! The-the situations, the
dialogue, everything. It’s-it’s full of intimate details between Elliot
and me! Which I don’t, I don’t see how you could even possibly know
about. A conversation we once had about adoption?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: still in her hand, as she speaks to her</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: I don’t see how Lee could know about these
things. I don’t! I don’t tell her everything.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Wow, I guess I hit a nerve.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: You make it sound like, you know, I have no
needs or something. You think I’m too self-sufficient?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: straightening at the</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: pantry to the food-</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Oh, wow! I don’t want to have this
conversation. I didn’t do anything wrong.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Y-you mentioned to me yourself that you and
Elliot were having some problems.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Yeah, we’re having some problems, but
problems that are my business…which I don’t see how you could know about
in such detail. How does Lee know about these things? How? They’re
private!</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: her sister as she</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: I don’t…I don’t want to bother everyone.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: That’s the point. I’d like to be
bothered.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: I don’t see how you could know about these
things unless Elliot’s been talking to you.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: No, he hasn’t. If I offended you, I’m
sorry.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: It’s over, Elliot. I don’t know how to make it
any clearer. It’s over. I can’t see you anymore.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Uh… I-I-I know. I deserve this.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Look, I’m just as much at fault.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: If-if-if you can believe I have such
feelings for you!</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: I’ve got to be honest with you. I met someone
else. I’ve met someone else. I…I told you I wasn’t going to wait
forever.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: But it hasn’t been forever.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: It’s been nearly a year since our first time
and you’re still married to my sister, which…I now realize is fine
because you’re probably much more in love with her than you know.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Yeah, but we-we made so many plans.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Yeah. Uh, well, sure we did. An- an-and in a
way you led me on, because I truly believed you were unhappy with
Hannah. Otherwise, I would never have let myself be drawn in. I was very
weak. So were you. Now I’ve met someone else.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Dinner soon?</p>
<p><strong>mavis</strong>: About fifteen minutes.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Uh-huh. Good.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: And you’re in love overnight?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: I care a great deal about him, yes.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Lee…</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Ah, it’s over! Elliot, I mean it. It’s
over!</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: half in and half out</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: smiling, and holding</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: I particularly liked the character of the
mother. Just a boozy old flirt with a filthy mouth.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: I’m so proud!</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Oh, Mom, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>uncle</strong>: Now here’s a toast to Thanksgiving, all
right?</p>
<p><strong>uncle</strong>: Are we supposed to have beer? Yeeeah!</p>
<p><strong>uncle</strong>: Let me at it! How’s that, Fletcher?</p>
<p><strong>uncle</strong>: Doll? To Thanksgiving. Here’s a little toast,
doll. Come on. Bottoms up.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Have you been talking to Holly or Lee about
us? About our-our personal life?</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Me? Of course not.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: There’s things Holly wrote about in her
script about us that are so…personal they could only have come from
you.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Look, I’ve got a splitting headache and I
don’t like being accused.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: I’m not accusing. I’m asking. Do you…do you
find me too…too giving? Too-too-too competent? Too-too, I don’t know,
disgustingly perfect or something?</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: gesturing, talking to</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: aspirin from the cabinet and walking</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: You never want to talk about it. I– Every
time I bring it up, you- you change the subject. What is it? Do you–
We’re communicating less and less. You sleep with me less and less.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Hannah and pointing</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: trembling slightly,</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Well, maybe I’ve asked advice once or twice
or-or made a joke.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Well, what do you do? Do-do-do you talk to
Holly, or Lee, or what? Do you, do you, do you phone them?</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Leave me alone, can you?!</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Jesus, I’ve told you. I need someone I can
matter to.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: You matter to me. Completely.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: It’s hard to be around someone who gives so
much and-and needs so little in return!</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: But, look…I-I have enormous needs.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Well, I can’t see them, and neither can Lee
or Holly!</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: It’s so pitch-black tonight. I feel
lost.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: You’re not lost.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: I love you so much.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Mmm, I don’t know if you remember me, but we
had the worst night of my life together.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: I remember you.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Yes, you do recall, right?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: I recall you.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: I was walking past and I saw you in
here…</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: …and I thought I’d come in and…and we could
replay, uh, the whole, uh…</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: laughing and shaking</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Oh, that’s putting it mildly. We did
everything but exchange gunshots.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: How are you?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Good. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: You look wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Oh, no.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Yeah, really. You do. You do.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: It was a terrible evening.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Yeah, it was.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Remember slamming the cab door in my face
and.. you know, it came very dangerously close to emasculating my nose
in a…</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: I’d never do that.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: …in a really horrible way.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Oh, well, that was a long time ago.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: You look wonderful. You do. What happened to
you?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: People change…you know.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Well, I hope you’ve changed.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Yeah, I hope you have, too.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: I hope so for your sake, because, uh, your
personality left something to be desired…</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Yeah, and for yours. I’m sure you’ve
changed.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: …namely a personality.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: So how are you?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: I’m okay.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: You didn’t answer my question. What are you
doing?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Oh, nothing much. You know…</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: …just some stuff. A little of this, a little
of that, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Yeah? Is that an embarrassing question?
Should I have not asked it?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Probably not.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Are you, are you out of work or
something?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: No, well…I’ve been trying to write.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Have you?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Well, that’s interesting. Wh-what kind of
stuff?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Oh…well, you-you’re not interested in
this.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: No, you can tell me.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: No, I am. I am.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Oh, no, millions of people come up to you and
say, “Hey, I have something I just wrote,” right?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Nobody ever said it.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: This is it. Yeah. This is really–</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: turning from the record bins to look</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Well, yes, I would if, uh, if it would mean
anything to you. I don’t know why it would.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: No, the reason I ask is–</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: You’ve always hated my taste in the
past.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: No, I haven’t.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: You have.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: I haven’t. No, the reason why I ask is I
think it might make a great, uh, television script, and, you know,
you’re so active in television, so–</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: I’m not anymore. I haven’t, I haven’t been
in television for a year.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: You’re kidding me.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: I’ve done no television whatsoever. No.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: I may, I may have to get back into it,
’cause my accountant says that I’m running out of dollars. But…but, um,
no, I haven’t, I just sort of dropped out for a year…</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Oh. Oh.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: …which is a long, dull story and I won’t get
into it. But–</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: You’re okay, though, huh?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: I’m– Yes. Yes, I’m fine. I’m fine. How are
you?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Oh, I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: What…what about your script? So what’s it
about?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Well, I’d love it if you’d read it, actually,
’cause I really would value your opinion.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: You have to remember, we-we-we didn’t agree
on one thing.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: But you have to remember while you’re reading
and you’re cursing my name, you know, that this is my first script.
Well, it’s not my first script.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Hmm.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Actually, my first script was about Hannah
and her husband, but, uh…</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: …Hannah read it, she got really angry, and…
you know, then I felt badly, so I–</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Oh, well, God, I can imagine what you
wrote.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Oh, no! It wasn’t anything bad. But she just…
you know. I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: So, uh…I threw it out, but I have this other
one.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Well, you know, I-I-I…you know, if you want
me to, I’ll read it.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Oh, gosh, I don’t know. Well, could I come
over tomorrow and read it to you?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Come over tomorrow and read it to me?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: You must be joking. I’ve been doing all my
own reading since I was forty…you know.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Hmm. I think it’s lucky I ran into you.
Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Well, what about me?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Oh, well.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: I should have kept going. I-I have a
sneaking feeling, a nagging sensation I should’ve kept walking and…</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: …and not begun this conversation.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: camera moves across the room towards her</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: That’s the end.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: No, you can tell me straight. It’s okay.
Just, you know, tell me what you think.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: It’s great. I swea– I’m– I’m, tch, I’m
speechless. I was…I was not in the mood to listen to this thing now. I
don’t know what to say. I’m moved and I laughed and I– Uh, I, you know,
I was on the edge of my seat. I just think it’s wonderful! I’m, I’m
totally…stunned. This is not an insult. I’m amazed that you can… It was–
I just thought it was great.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Yes! I was abso– And…w- what…made you think
of that climax scene where the, where the… architect is walking home
with his actress girlfriend and-and the ex- wife who’s schizophrenic
jumps out of the bushes and stabs him to death?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Oh, it just came to me one day.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Well, it was just fabulous! I’m, I, you
know…</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Oh, gosh, you really think I can write?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: I thought it was wonder– There’s maybe one
or two things in there that I would do differently myself, but…</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: …but who cares? It was just– It was
fabulous.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Fabulous, I mean it! I’m so impressed.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Oh, God!</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: I am. You-you made my day.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Oh, wow!</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: It was just great. Uh, I was all set…I was
set to be bored stiff.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Uh, gee. Would you like to have lunch? Uh,
uh…</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: I-I would love to talk to you about, uh,
that script. I-I, you know, I think maybe that we could do something
with it.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Okay, and listen, I would like to hear what
made you suddenly decide to drop out of life.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Oh, who cares?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Y-you used to– Oh, no! Yeah, I care. You used
to be so ambitious and… God, you really liked it?!</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Gosh, you really went through a crisis, you
know that? H-how did you get over it? I mean, when I ran into you, you
seemed, you seemed just perfectly fine. Well, you seem fine now.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Well… I’ll tell you. One day about a month
ago…</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: …I really hit bottom. You know, I just felt
that in a Godless universe, I didn’t want to go on living. Now I happen
to own this rifle…</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: …which I loaded, believe it or not, and
pressed it to my forehead. And I remember thinking, at the time, I’m
gonna kill myself. Then I thought…what if I’m wrong? What if there is a
God? I mean, after all, nobody really knows that.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: But then I thought, no. You know, maybe is
not good enough. I want certainty or nothing. And I remember very
clearly the clock was ticking, and I was sitting there frozen, with the
gun to my head, debating whether to shoot.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: All of a sudden, the gun went off.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: I had been so tense, my finger had squeezed
the trigger inadvertently…</p>
<p><strong>neighbor #1</strong>: What’s happening? Wh-wh-what’s going
on?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: …but I was perspiring so much, the gun had
slid off my forehead and missed me.</p>
<p><strong>neighbor #2</strong>: I don’t know. I heard a gun. Is
everything all right?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: And suddenly, neighbors were, were, pounding
on the door, and-and I don’t know, the whole scene was just pandemonium.
And, uh, you know, and I-I-I-I-I ran to the door.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: I-I-I-I didn’t know what to say. You know, I
was, I was embarrassed and confused, and my-my-my mind was r-r-racing a
mile a minute…</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: …and I-I jus knew one thing.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: I…I-I-I-I had to get out of that house. I
had to just get out in the fresh air and-and clear my head. And I
remember very clearly. I walked the streets. I walked and I walked. I-I
didn’t know what was going through my mind. It all seemed so violent and
un-unreal to me. And I wandered…</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: …for a long time on the Upper West Side, you
know, an-and it must have been hours! You know, my, my feet hurt. My
head was, was pounding, and, and I had to sit down. I went into a movie
house. I-I didn’t know what was playing or anything.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: I just, I just needed a moment to gather my
thoughts and, and be logical, and, and put the world back into rational
perspective.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: And I went upstairs to the balcony, and I
sat down and, you know, the movie was a-a-a film that I’d seen many
times in my life since I was a kid, an-and I always u-uh, loved it. And,
you know, I’m, I’m watching these people up on the screen, and I started
getting hooked o-on the film, you know?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: …And I started to feel how can you even
think of killing yourself? I mean, isn’t it so stupid? I mean, l-look at
all the people up there on the screen. You know, they’re real funny,
and, and what if the worst is true?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: What if there’s no God, and you only go
around once and that’s it? Well, you know, don’t you want to be part of
the experience? You know, what the hell, it-i-it’s not all a drag. And
I’m thinking to myself, geez, I should stop ruining my life…</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: …searching for answers I’m never gonna get,
and just enjoy it while it lasts. And…you know…</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: …after, who knows? I mean, you know, maybe
there is something. Nobody really knows. I know, I know “maybe” is a
very slim reed to hang your whole life on, but that’s the best we have.
And…then, I started to sit back, and I actually began to enjoy
myself.</p>
<p><strong>marx brothers &amp; company</strong>: “Oh, Freedonia Oh,
don’t you cry for me They’ll be coming around the mountain…”</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Um…look, there’s something I’ve, uh, that’s
been bothering me for a long time, and I just thought I’d just tell you
what it was and just sort of clear the deck here, and that’s this.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Oh, yeah? What?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: That I’ve always regretted the way I behaved
that evening we went out, and, uh…I’ve, I just thought I’d tell you that
because I really made a fool out of myself.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Oh, don’t be silly! No! Don’t be
ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: It’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: I was the, I was… You know, it was my fault.
I–</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: So, so you want to go out to dinner again? I
mean, is that, is that… Have, you have any interest in that, or…</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Sure. Sure, uh, yes.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Do you? I mean, are you, are you, are you,
are you free this evening?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: I want ice! Who’s got some– Oh, there it
is.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: It’s on the table, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Hey, where’s Holly? She’s late.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Hey, Hannah, did you read that last thing Holly
wrote? It was great. She’s really developed.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: I know, she…she really writes good
dialogue.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Yeah. I’ll get some ice.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Hannah, can I tell everybody you’re going to
play Desdemona?</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Oh, Mom, it’s only television.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Yes, but it’s public television. And to me,
Shakespeare doesn’t get any greater than Othello. You with some big
black stud! I love it!</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Oh, Mom!</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Oh, honey!</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Oh, Lee, you are something.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: You look very beautiful. Marriage agrees
with you. Everything that happened between us seems more and more
hazy.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: I acted like such a fool. I don’t know what
came over me. That complete conviction that I couldn’t live without
you.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: What did I put us both through? And
Hannah…</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: …who as you once said, I love much more than
I realized.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Hi! How are you! Happy Thanksgiving!</p>
<p><strong>boy #1</strong>: Hi!</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: I didn’t miss dinner, did I?</p>
<p><strong>children</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Huh? Hi, Marge.</p>
<p><strong>female guest #1</strong>: You look lovely.</p>
<p><strong>female guest #2</strong>: Hello, darling.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Happy Thanksgiving.</p>
<p><strong>female guest #2</strong>: Good to see you. Same to you.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: It’s beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Now don’t get nervous. It’s just your
husband.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Hi. How you doin’?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: When’d you get here?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Just a few minutes ago.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Oh. You look so beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: You know, I was talking with your father
before…and I was telling him that it’s ironic. I-I used to always have
Thanksgiving with Hannah…and I never thought that I could love anybody
else. And here it is, years later and I’m married to you and completely
in love with you. The heart is a very, very resilient little muscle. It
really is. I… It’d made a great story, I think. A guy marries one
sister… doesn’t work out… many years later… he winds up married to the
other sister. It’s, you know, it’s a…</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Tch.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: I don’t know how you’re gonna top that.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Mickey?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Mmm, what?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: I’m pregnant.</p>
