<p><strong>burned out row of stores.</strong>: His is the only one still
occupied, and it doesn’t look that permanent. In the window is a
cardboard, handwritten sign that reads “Kwan’s Shaolin Kung Fu”. What
remains visible behind the poster and the security grate is an
IMPRESSION of people moving and milling around.</p>
<p><strong>kwan</strong>: At Shaolin Temple, in misty Songshan
mountains, We monks trained in iron palm until our hands bled…</p>
<p><strong>young adult</strong>: I guess not…</p>
<p><strong>angle on kwan</strong>: As he walks around the different
people training. As one woman is moving through an intricate series of
movements, he sighs and rearranges her hands.</p>
<p><strong>kwan</strong>: Tiger grasps his tail, not hamburger!</p>
<p><strong>student</strong>: Master Kwan, when can I learn flying kicks?
I see Bruce Lee…</p>
<p><strong>kwan</strong>: Never in my days at the Shaolin Temple have I
seen uniform as beautiful as this. Thank you, Mrs. Rodriguez. I wish
Drew were here to thank you himself. Ta ma de!</p>
<p><strong>kwan</strong>: Luck is no concern, Mrs. Rodriguez. Shaolin
warriors depend on heart and soul � that’s how they saved the T’ang
emporer.</p>
<p><strong>kwan</strong>: Xie Xie, Mrs. Rodriguez.</p>
<p><strong>establishing shot of interior.</strong>: The area is
dilapidated, but very clean, with all kinds of kung fu and Chinese
paraphenalia lying around. Around the corner comes the spooky light, and
, we see DREW</p>
<p><strong>angle on kwan</strong>: Who is quietly settling into a
shadowy corner of the garage, watching Drew.</p>
<p><strong>angle on drew</strong>: As he continues to move around the
workout area, his arms and body moving as he tries to match the
movements on the TV. Suddenly, Kwan jumps out of the shadows, attacking.
Drew reacts instantly, evading the attack, the wax sloshing around in
the bowls but not spilling . Kwan continues the attack, and Drew evades,
their movements matching the movements on the TV almost move for move.
It is a beautiful ballet, and Drew ends it by sweeping Kwan down to the
ground. When Kwan hits the ground, hard, his face is lit by the TV
screen.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Is taking the glued-on cups of wax off his
shoulders, while peeling the already hard wax off his chest.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Practicing. I saw it in this movie…</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: I’ll still win. Besides, the Shaolin monks
never had tapes to study… they did it this way… right?</p>
<p><strong>kwan</strong>: Not quite � our drills at the temple had
meaning. If we had tapes, we would have watched them.</p>
<p><strong>kwan</strong>: “The warrior who knows himself and his
opponent will win 100 times in 100 battles.” Study the tapes I gave you.
All these years of one on one training � you’re the best I’ve ever
taught.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Look, Bob, I’m not bothering you, am I?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: I’m not your son, Bob. Lay off.</p>
<p><strong>reaction shot of kwan</strong>: Closing his already opened
mouth.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You’re here because I told your Mom I’d see you
were taken care of… after. At least respect my wishes, and make
something of yourself… Stop wasting your time!</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: When I’m the best fighter in the country, I’m
not going to let you be part of my entourage…</p>
<p><strong>kwan</strong>: I wish I had the chance…</p>
<p><strong>angle on trevor</strong>: As he knocks out an opponent.</p>
<p><strong>angle on crowd</strong>: Applauding.</p>
<p><strong>angle on trevor</strong>: Taunting a different opponent.
Trevor executes a beautiful technique and puts the guy down and out.</p>
<p><strong>angle on team</strong>: who are cheering Trevor on.</p>
<p><strong>angle on trevor</strong>: As he plays with the next
fighter.</p>
<p><strong>pfeelgut</strong>: Exactly!</p>
<p><strong>angle on pfeelgut</strong>: Toweling off, who is yelling to
Trevor.</p>
<p><strong>get him! now!!</strong>: Trevor looks at him for a moment,
not really understanding, then sees what the psychologist is saying. He
lunges immediately forward and knocks the guy out while he is still
trying to pull his pants up.</p>
<p><strong>angle on crowd as they enjoy the show immensely</strong>:
Trevor has learned the lesson of the day, and he walks off.</p>
<p><strong>establishing shot of trevor being pampered by his
entourage</strong>: The masseur is massaging his shoulders, a woman is
doing a pedicure and another is doing a manicure. An exercise
physiologist is going over a computer print out with Trevor, when an old
Korean master, MASTER KIM, comes into the room.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Learn English, will ya? And, tell me
something I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>chauncy</strong>: Very good, sir.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Don’t come here any more, you hear? Over a
little more to the left, Sam.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: It’s hard being me, you know. So much
pressure…</p>
<p><strong>ext. coliseum � day</strong>: People are streaming into the
large building. The marquee out front reads “Diamond Nationals”.</p>
<p><strong>angle on trevor</strong>: Making his entrance. He is in a
perfectly laundered and pressed suit, and his assistant is carrying
another suit pressed and ready to go.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: The finals.</p>
<p><strong>angle on drew</strong>: As he wins.</p>
<p><strong>angle on trevor</strong>: Drew watching, as he wins
again.</p>
<p><strong>drew again</strong>: Winning. The stage is set for the
finals.</p>
<p><strong>angle on the ring</strong>: Drew and Trevor are already
inside, waiting. Drew fights in a mish mosh of gear , while Trevor is
decked out in designer, personalized gear.</p>
<p><strong>kwan</strong>: You only lose if you give up.</p>
<p><strong>angle on trevor’s corner</strong>: The psychologist is
exhorting him to destroy Drew. Trevor leans back on his padded stool,
smiling. The 3rd round starts. In this round, Trevor is destroying Drew,
making him look ridiculous. A clinch comes, and before they can break,
Trevor grabs the drawstring</p>
<p><strong>new york night skyline in the b.g.</strong>: They are not
talking, they are just walking, Drew kicking a can and contemplating the
future, and the past.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: No next time, Master. Maybe… … you should find
a new student. I just can’t do it � I’m not getting any better!</p>
<p><strong>kwan</strong>: Don’t talk like that. At Shaolin…</p>
<p><strong>kwan</strong>: The crowd whispered “Shaolin”, and he bowed to
us, touched my cheek and smiled, then just walked on. I watched him
until he disappeared in the distance. He was larger than life, a hero to
a little boy of 5. I vowed then and there to become like him, fight for
right like the Shaolin.</p>
<p><strong>kwan</strong>: I never did, though. My family left China and
ended up here in New York, a young boy’s dream left behind in</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: You mean… all the stories…?</p>
<p><strong>kwan</strong>: Made up. I never trained at the Shaolin
Temple. When I realized my dream couldn’t come true, I convinced myself
that it had anyway. It was a small step to convince other people.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Why are you telling me this?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Never were?</p>
<p><strong>kwan</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>kwan</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: I’m going to the Shaolin Temple � they can
train me so I will never lose like that again.</p>
<p><strong>kwan</strong>: He hit you so hard, you’re delirious. I’ll get
a cold cloth.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Master…</p>
<p><strong>angle on kwan and drew</strong>: As Kwan drops drew off at
the AIRPORT. Drew takes his suitcase and</p>
<p><strong>of bicycles around him.</strong>: Bicycle bells ring loudly
as figures dressed in the same drab clothes ride around him, their faces
covered with scarves and surgical masks against the northern China dirt.
CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL TIAN AN MEN SQUARE and the huge photo of
CHAIRMAN MAO on the front of the Meridian Gate of the Forbidden City.
Drew continues his run, past a group of western-dressed lyou mang, who
watch him run by through dark glasses. Drew runs through a large city
park, stopping to watch a group of older citizens going through Tai Zhi
routines under the weeping willow trees there.</p>
<p><strong>drew pov ext. countryside � day</strong>: Drew watches the
countryside go by. Temples, farms and rice paddies slide by, with an
occasionally glimpse of the Great Wall.</p>
<p><strong>establishing shot of drew getting off the train.</strong>: He
stops on the platform for a moment, a huge colorful Chinese billboard in
the b.g. A transit cop quickly comes up to him and prods him into
motion. Drew walks on, passing a sign that reads “Luoyang”.</p>
<p><strong>establishing shot of drew making his way toward the shaolin
temple.</strong>: He stops at a drink stand and orders one. As soon as
he stops, he is ringed with people watching his every move � he feels
almost like a movie star. The woman in the stand hands him a drink, and
takes the money out of his hand.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Where is the Shaolin Temple? Shaolin?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: The Shaolin Temple? How hard can that be?
Geez, doesn’t anyone speak English here?</p>
<p><strong>angle on ashema</strong>: As she pushes her way to the front
of the group. She is a strikingly beautiful young woman.</p>
<p><strong>ashema</strong>: I do. But wouldn’t it make more sense for
you to speak Chinese than to expect us to speak English?</p>
<p><strong>ashema</strong>: Why do you want to find the temple?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: I am going to join the temple as a monk.</p>
<p><strong>ashema</strong>: I’m going that way � I can take you.</p>
<p><strong>establishing shot of ashema pedaling drew.</strong>: It is
not the most stable ride � Ashema is struggling to keep moving, while
Drew is doing his best to stay on the bike.</p>
<p><strong>ashema</strong>: We are here.</p>
<p><strong>establishing shot of the temple.</strong>: This is it � the
temple he came halfway around the world to see. The Shaolin Temple, the
birthplace of the martial arts.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Whoa!</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: What’s the deal here? Is everybody deaf in
this temple? Even if you heard me, you wouldn’t understand, would you?
Huh, baldy? Shine your head for a quarter?</p>
<p><strong>int. temple � same day</strong>: The monks are still
chanting. Drew stands there, listening some more, moving with the beat,
until they stop chanting. Drew, thinking it was some kind of
performance, claps his hands.</p>
<p><strong>admissions monk</strong>: That’s not possible.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: What do you mean, sir?</p>
<p><strong>admissions monk</strong>: The training is too difficult.
Besides, Shaolin policy is no foreigners.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: I didn’t come all this way, from America, to
get turned away. I want in. I want to become a Shaolin monk.</p>
<p><strong>admissions monk</strong>: What people want and what they can
have are often not the same.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Not in this case.</p>
<p><strong>monk</strong>: Oh, yes, especially in this case.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Hey! What about my…</p>
<p><strong>table, now lit by candles and a lantern.</strong>: A bunch of
tea bowls are scattered in front of Drew, as if he’s been drinking
heavily. He points to his teacup, and Ashema shakes her head.</p>
<p><strong>ashema</strong>: You’ve had enough.</p>
<p><strong>ashema</strong>: Maybe it’s for the best, Drew. You belong in
America. New</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: I have to do this. I can’t go home, not until
I’m a monk. I’d be even more of a disgrace…</p>
<p><strong>ashema</strong>: Not now, Bau Bau.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Bau Bau?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: How long?</p>
<p><strong>ashema</strong>: A long time � through the worst weather. He
just sat there, unmoving, through rain, sleet, snow.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Did they let him in?</p>
<p><strong>ashema</strong>: No. Of course they did � what kind of story
do you think my</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Please tell your grandfather, your Bau Bau, he
is a wise man. And that he tells a good story.</p>
<p><strong>ashema</strong>: What are you going to do? Are you going
home?</p>
<p><strong>angle on drew sweating in the hot sunshine</strong>: Sweat is
running into Drew’s eyes, and he is trying to keep them from
stinging.</p>
<p><strong>angle on drew being tormented by local kids</strong>: They
are playing games around him, throwing stones at him, messing with his
hair and his clothes, touching the things in his backpack , etc.</p>
<p><strong>ashema</strong>: Give this up, Drew! Please?</p>
<p><strong>angle on spider, who is back</strong>: This time it stays
even longer. Drew looks down at it and smiles.</p>
<p><strong>angle on monks from temple</strong>: Looking out the windows
at the crazy foreigner in their courtyard.</p>
<p><strong>angle on drew in courtyard</strong>: As a school group comes
through the temple. The children are tied together with a rope, and the
teacher motions to the crazy American. Drew has become an
attraction!</p>
<p><strong>angle on drew, surrounded by old men</strong>: They are
marveling at his perserverance.</p>
<p><strong>angle on drew, wind and rain</strong>: This time it doesn’t
seem to bother him so much.</p>
<p><strong>angle on drew with ashema and her bau bau there</strong>: Bau
Bau speaks quickly in Chinese.</p>
<p><strong>establishing shot of drew still sitting in the
courtyard.</strong>: The old monk, San De, comes back, the same monk
following behind him with the suitcase. He looks at Drew, a little
surprise showing in his face at seeing the American still there. He
doesn’t stop, though. He goes into the temple, shaking his head.</p>
<p><strong>angle on drew</strong>: Same as the first shot, all alone in
the temple.</p>
<p><strong>establishing shot of courtyard, drew all alone.</strong>: The
door to the temple opens and out comes San De, alone this time.</p>
<p><strong>san de</strong>: My head is shiny enough already, don’t you
think?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: You… You speak English? I’m sorry, I was just
goofing… I apologize, master. I didn’t mean to make fun of you…</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: It was at first. I was uncomfortable, in pain,
actually, but as time went on, I got… into it, I guess. The sacrifice
made me feel… in control, you know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: At first I was really bored, and very lonely.
But then,</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: It was an incredible experience � I said I’d
do it, and I did it.</p>
<p><strong>san de</strong>: I wish you all the best.</p>
<p><strong>ashema</strong>: They are disciples. This is the last class
for fighting monks at Shaolin.</p>
<p><strong>angle on drew</strong>: Who is crushed. His chance is
gone.</p>
<p><strong>angle on first disciple</strong>: Who is asked…</p>
<p><strong>monk</strong>: Do you accept the authority of the Shaolin
patriarchs?</p>
<p><strong>monk</strong>: Do you renounce the earthly world?</p>
<p><strong>monk</strong>: Will you abide by the rules of the temple,
even if it means death?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Yes, without pause.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Yes, without pause.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: I mean, no, of course not.</p>
<p><strong>gao</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Oh, unbelievable, in the same place…</p>
<p><strong>san de</strong>: Are they ready to begin their training?</p>
<p><strong>drill sergeant</strong>: They are.</p>
<p><strong>angle on the disciples</strong>: All of whom are happy. All,
that is, except for Gao, who is staring at Drew. Drew, notices the
stare.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: You got a problem, man?</p>
<p><strong>gao</strong>: You, American…</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: What are you doing, man?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: No way, man! Get your own…</p>
<p><strong>d.s.</strong>: It is unseemly to argue like this. Take the
backpack into the sleeping quarters.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: What’s with that guy?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Mr. James designs my hair, master. I don’t
think…</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Can’t I just wear a patch?</p>
<p><strong>the courtyard.</strong>: They are running their hands over
their heads. Drew comes out of the building, his head shaved completely
clean.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: What outside world? I don’t want to be seen by
anybody…</p>
<p><strong>d.s.</strong>: We are no longer Chinese or Americans, Han or
Mongol. We are Shaolin. Everyone is a monk.</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: I will switch with Disciple Gao.</p>
<p><strong>d.s.</strong>: Go to sleep. No talking! We have an early day
of training tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Jerk!</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Blow me!</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Good night, Li.</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: Wan an.</p>
<p><strong>angle on drew, sleeping</strong>: All is quiet.</p>
<p><strong>angle on gao</strong>: Who seems to be sleeping
peacefully.</p>
<p><strong>angle on drew</strong>: As he climbs back into bed,
bone-weary. He lies back down to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>d.s.</strong>: You don’t like it, don’t eat it.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: I didn’t say I wasn’t going to eat it…
Geez!</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Well, at least we start training today, right,
guys?</p>
<p><strong>workout clothes.</strong>: They are the standard fighting
monk issue � suitable for martial arts training.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Wonder what they’ll start us with first?</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: Iron Palm?</p>
<p><strong>shu</strong>: Wooden Man, I think.</p>
<p><strong>angle on the d.s.</strong>: As he walks to the front of the
group. In his hand he is carrying a shovel. D.S. Bodhidharma, the
patriarch of the Shaolin Temple taught us that to train the mind, we
first have to train the body.</p>
<p><strong>wu</strong>: Basics, I told you.</p>
<p><strong>d.s.</strong>: Each one of you take a shovel.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: We’re using the shovels as weapons?</p>
<p><strong>d.s.</strong>: Weapons… … in the war on infection.</p>
<p><strong>angle on drew and the other disciples</strong>: Digging with
their shovels. Their training clothes are already sweated through and
dirty. Their shirts are off, and their arm muscles are bulging and
shining in the hot sunshine.</p>
<p><strong>angle on drew</strong>: As he lifts up two heavy buckets of
dirt on a pole, then places the pole on his shoulders, the muscles in
his arms, shoulders and back straining. He walks off to the side of the
area to dump it. As he dumps the dirt, a pole appears and CRACKS across
his back. He drops the buckets and falls to the ground. He gets up as
quickly as</p>
<p><strong>angle on drew and disciples</strong>: As they are working
hard on the latrines. Drew is teaching them an American song as they
work.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: “Ain’t no cure for the Shaolin Temple
Blues…”</p>
<p><strong>or</strong>: “Working on a Chain Gang”</p>
<p><strong>or</strong>: “I fought the law and the law won”</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: What’d you do that for?</p>
<p><strong>d.s.</strong>: Do a job well or don’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>angle on gao and the disciples</strong>: As they are in line
for water. They each drink a large glass full, then move back to their
work area. Drew is the last in line. When Drew gets to the front, the
D.S. smiles and shakes his head.</p>
<p><strong>d.s.</strong>: Sorry, all gone. Get some more.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: I’m gonna get you, man. Oh, yeah…</p>
<p><strong>establishing shot of disciples all in bed.</strong>: They are
exhausted from their work. Drew is lying in bed, his eyes wide open,
ready to get attacked.</p>
<p><strong>carrying huge baskets of dirt on his pole.</strong>: He is
balancing as he walks.</p>
<p><strong>angle on gao</strong>: Who is working at the other end. He
starts across the same ridge.</p>
<p><strong>gao</strong>: Back up and let me pass.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: No chance, Gao. You back up.</p>
<p><strong>closeup on drew’s bloody hand</strong>: A huge splinter
sticking out of it. He is in real pain. The D.S. walks over and looks at
the splinter, and in one move pulls it out.</p>
<p><strong>d.s.</strong>: He failed to pass through the wooden man
chamber. He must leave the temple.</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: The “Wooden Man Chamber”! The ultimate test of a
Shaolin monk…</p>
<p><strong>shu</strong>: Poor guy.</p>

<p><strong>gao</strong>: Let me pass.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: There’s something on the bottom of your
basket.</p>
<p><strong>the disciples are working extremely hard.</strong>: As they
work, a group of fighting monks walk by after a workout. Drew stops

<p><strong>angle on drew massaging his muscles</strong>: He is sitting

addresses the group. Gao is standing off to the side, a smug smile on
his face.</p>

happens within your group. What happened yesterday falls on everyone’s
shoulders. So, all of you will do double work…</p>

bamboo shinai is SLAMMED across Drew’s back, waking him up.</p>
<p><strong>meditation monk</strong>: Bodhidharma meditated for 9 years
without sleeping. Think you can manage 9 minutes?</p>
<p><strong>mu</strong>: But we swore to obey them…</p>
<p><strong>mu</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: We have to stand up for our rights! If they
don’t even know we’re dissatisfied, things will never change.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Are we men or mice? Sheep or the shepherd?</p>
<p><strong>wu</strong>: I’m with you!</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: I’m for going to the Headmaster right now!</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Master San De!</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: We have something to say…</p>
<p><strong>san de</strong>: This is an interesting coincidence, as I was
just on my way to your sleeping quarters to talk with you all.</p>
<p><strong>san de</strong>: I think I’d better…</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: No, really, I want to…</p>
<p><strong>san de</strong>: Here at the temple, we use a period of
intense physical labor to test your patience, and to teach you humility
and self-reliance. As you continue training, you will be given chores
every day � remember the first time you saw me I was sweeping? Physical
labor keeps us humble.</p>
<p><strong>establishing shot of door to the sleeping quarters.</strong>:
Suddenly, it BURSTS open and in come the disciples, led by Drew. They
fan out into the room, Drew in the center.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Gentlemen, this calls for a party!</p>

Kick. Punch.</p>
<p><strong>monk</strong>: In order to keep our bodies strong,
Bodhidharma gave us a series of exercises and breathing techniques.
Because the times demanded action, we developed Shaolin style wu shu
from these exercises.</p>

<p><strong>angle on drew</strong>: Confused.</p>
<p><strong>angle on monk</strong>: Who doesn’t explain any further.</p>

least he doesn’t fall.</p>

<p><strong>monk</strong>: This is Shaolin Wu Shu. Continue.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Excuse me, Master, but there aren’t any mats
here.</p>
<p><strong>d.s.</strong>: Do they always use mats in America?</p>
<p><strong>d.s.</strong>: If you are scared, I’ll get someone else.
Perhaps Gao would assist me…</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Let’s do it.</p>
<p><strong>d.s.</strong>: Attack me straight on…</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: I’m not sure I got that last throw clear in my
mind.</p>
<p><strong>d.s.</strong>: I said that’s enough.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: If you’re getting too old for this kind of
training, I understand.</p>
<p><strong>d.s.</strong>: Attack!</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: I think I’ve got it now. Xie Xie!</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: Are you trying to kill yourself?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: He hurts more than me, he’s just not bleeding,
that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>gao looks down and sees drew</strong>: Hhe smiles, then pours
the huge bucket over the edge, dousing Drew.</p>

together.</p>
<p><strong>d.s.</strong>: In this exercise, you try to touch your

<p><strong>playing catch with a frisbee.</strong>: Drew is flipping it
in a bunch of different ways, and Li is enjoying watching him. To the
side of the courtyard are two brooms leaning against the wall.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: This sure beats sweeping…</p>
<p><strong>angle on frisbee</strong>: Floating past temple statues and
ancient Chinese decorations, barely missing them. Drew makes an
acrobatic catch and then flicks it back to Li, harder than he should
have. It heads for an ancient statue and smacks it dead center, right in
the face. The statue starts to tip! Drew and Li rush for the statue and
catch it, just before it tips over and smashes on the ground. They look
at each other, thanking their lucky stars the statue didn’t fall. They
start to throw the frisbee again, when Drew spots the D.S. coming
towards them. Drew stashes the frisbee in his shirt and grabs the
brooms.</p>

is filled with paintings and scrolls. A Golden Sash hangs in a place of
honor. San De puts the tea leaves into the pot, then soaks them with
boiling water. He pours the water out, then repeats the process several
times. His movements are all very precise and careful � it almost looks
like a martial art kata.</p>
<p><strong>san de</strong>: Legend states that Bodhidharma gave us tea.
Once, while meditating, Bodhidharma fell asleep, a natural reaction we
all have to fight against.</p>
<p><strong>san de</strong>: When he awoke, he was so enraged at his
eyelids for betraying him, he tore them off and threw them to the
ground. From those eyelids grew the first tea bush. You see, even the
leaves look like eyelids.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Master! Stop! No more will go in!</p>
<p><strong>san de</strong>: Exactly! You are like this cup, full of what
you have learned. How can we show you Shaolin unless you first empty
your cup?</p>
<p><strong>san de</strong>: The rules and disciplines of the temple
exist to free you, not restrict you. They keep your mind from
harmful</p>
<p><strong>shaolin wu shu.</strong>: His body moves with the wind,
bending and swaying. Another monk is attacking him with a hard style,
and the soft style is very effective. Drew and Li try it, and Drew is
having a lot of trouble. He is used to training hard style, and the soft
style seems too weak for him. D.S. comes over.</p>
<p><strong>d.s.</strong>: And if it was always like this?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Again, deformed.</p>
<p><strong>collected.</strong>: They are not dressed in their monastic
robes, however. They are in street clothes. It is their day off! A monk
comes down the line, handing out hats to the disciples. They</p>

around, sees Drew but doesn’t immediately recognize him. She looks
around the park.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: ASHEMA! Here!</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: What!?!</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: You can get kicked out of the temple for
this…</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Who’s going to tell, Li? You?</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: We really shouldn’t be doing this…</p>
<p><strong>ashema</strong>: My school is having a party this Tuesday
night. Can you and your friends come?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: We’ll be there.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: You dance, and talk. And have a good time.</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: That clinches it, we can’t dance.</p>
<p><strong>wu</strong>: And we don’t know how to talk to girls…</p>
<p><strong>gao</strong>: Like you know?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Look, dancing’s easy. I’ll show you. We’ll
start with slow dancing.</p>

<p><strong>drew</strong>: Loosen up, Li. She’s not going to bite!</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: How do you know?</p>

dancing with his pillow cheek to cheek, and occasionally sneaking a
kiss.</p>

<p><strong>drew</strong>: Disciple Gao was better than me.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: I lost my temper. He was only defending
himself.</p>
<p><strong>angle on san de</strong>: Who nods his head and looks at
Drew.</p>
<p><strong>gao</strong>: Yes. But, I am not completely blameless…</p>
<p><strong>san de</strong>: I didn’t think you were… The Shaolin martial
tradition is built on challenges. We challenge ourselves, but we do not
fight with each other. Never do we fight to see who is best � we train
to be able to right wrongs, not to let our hands and feet express
emotions run wild. A Shaolin never throws a punch or kick in anger.
Shake hands and let your emotions go.</p>
<p><strong>gao</strong>: In your dreams…</p>
<p><strong>establishing shot of disciples getting ready to go
out.</strong>: They are dressed in “street” clothes and are just pulling

the same school where Drew first met Ashema. The guys, still happy,

<p><strong>drew</strong>: Ladies, allow me to introduce my best friends
in all of China…</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: This is Gao. And this wild man is Li…</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Not now, Li…</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: What can I do for you?</p>
<p><strong>angle on disciples.</strong>: They have noticed what is going
on.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: No, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>angle on the disciples</strong>: As they climb back into the
dorm room.</p>
<p><strong>is drew.</strong>: He lands on the hardwood floor, panting

They are all dressed in their training clothes, dirtied after a full day

temple, and China!</p>
<p><strong>police captain</strong>: He’s a disgrace, to the temple and
to this country. He must leave.</p>
<p><strong>angle on drew</strong>: Who is staring down into the
abyss.</p>
<p><strong>police captain</strong>: This involves more than just the
temple. I am authorized to escort him from your temple to the jail now,
tonight, where he will be held until he leaves the country.</p>
<p><strong>d.s.</strong>: Master, may I? We accepted a challenge when
this disciple came into our ranks. If we force him to leave China, we
admit failure. Can we do that?</p>
<p><strong>d.s.</strong>: Would you be so hard hearted as to turn him
away from that which he so desperately needs?</p>
<p><strong>san de</strong>: Thank you all for coming. I am pleased that
you brought this problem to our attention. May you sleep well
tonight</p>
<p><strong>police captain</strong>: I do not wish to visit you again
with this kind of news.</p>
<p><strong>san de</strong>: You will not have to.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Master, I can’t tell you how sorry I am. I
appreciate you both going to bat like that for me. I won’t let it happen
again.</p>
<p><strong>establishing shot of drew with the other guys around
him.</strong>: He has just finished telling the disciples what is going
on.</p>
<p><strong>gao</strong>: Why only you?</p>

responsible for what happens.</p>

<p><strong>angle on drew lying in the dark</strong>: Everyone else is
asleep, but not Drew. He is staring at the ceiling.</p>
<p><strong>angle on drew</strong>: Walking through the courtyard, for
the last time. Only a few monks are around, and they don’t meet Drew’s
eyes. The sounds of training can be heard O.S. Drew stops to listen to
those sounds for a moment, then heads for the door.</p>
<p><strong>angle on drew</strong>: As he leaves the temple. He pauses
for a moment with the door open, then shuts it sadly. He looks out over
the courtyard, which is completely deserted. Drew sighs, hitches his
backpack onto his back and starts out. As he comes out of the doorway
and into the courtyard proper, he sees…</p>
<p><strong>gao</strong>: You’re either with us or against us,
remember?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: I’m with you!</p>
<p><strong>san de</strong>: You must accept the responsibility for your
life. If we force you out of the temple, you can always blame the</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: What if I can’t handle it? What if I fail?</p>
<p><strong>san de</strong>: Live for the moment, Drew. The future will
take care of itself. If you go through your days here, squeezing every
last bit of life out of every minute, you need not fear failure.</p>
<p><strong>gao</strong>: Are you staying?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Yeah, I’m staying. If only to keep you guys
out of trouble!</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: What? Honest, it’s happening! I…</p>
<p><strong>gao</strong>: Every class of disciples, the one with the most
potential is singled out for special training. We were wondering who it
was… now, we know.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Special training? You mean…?</p>

an especially difficult sequence of moves, and falls with a THUMP to the

set of moves, falls again. Instead of being angry, Drew just laughs at
himself, then climbs back up on the poles.</p>
<p><strong>angle on drew and li</strong>: As they go through a very
intricate, beautifully staged series of techniques. The last technique

blocking technique he refused to learn before.</p>
<p><strong>tight shot of d.s.’ arm</strong>: Gao’s hands are around his
elbow, pulling down.</p>

<p><strong>drew</strong>: What is the meaning of life?</p>
<p><strong>arhat</strong>: What is life? What is reality? The head of a
dead cat.</p>
<p><strong>arhat</strong>: For forty years, Shaolin disciples have made
their quest to deliver a scroll to me. You are not Chinese.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: No. American.</p>
<p><strong>arhat</strong>: I notice the littlest details.</p>
<p><strong>up.</strong>: The Arhat is already out there, moving through
his gong fu moves.</p>
<p><strong>arhat</strong>: The bus.</p>
<p><strong>drew’s pov of a road behind the arhat’s hut</strong>: A road!
After all he went through to get there?</p>
<p><strong>arhat</strong>: Bus stops every 20 min., will take you
straight to the temple.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Thank you, Master.</p>
<p><strong>angle on drew flying through the air</strong>: Hitting the
ground and rolling, then coming up and throwing a shuriken at a target.
The throwing star hits the target dead center.</p>
<p><strong>angle on drew</strong>: Manipulating the spear like a
master.</p>
<p><strong>sweltering summer sun in front of a run down farm
building.</strong>: The D.S. is standing in front of them.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: We’ve got to rebuild this?</p>
<p><strong>d.s.</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>temple.</strong>: He is going nowhere in particular, just
walking and thinking.</p>
<p><strong>white paper.</strong>: The CAMERA follows the sweeping brush,
as it ends with a FLOURISH. The CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL the temple
courtyard, where San De and the D.S. are standing in front of the group
of disciples.</p>
<p><strong>san de</strong>: Only one trial remains before you become
full fledged fighting monks. The Wooden Man Chamber.</p>
<p><strong>angle on the disciples</strong>: They are remembering the
stories they have heard about the chamber.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Then I must pass this final test. Furthermore,
I request that I be the first one through.</p>
<p><strong>san de</strong>: Your request is granted.</p>
<p><strong>angle on drew</strong>: In front of the entrance to the
Wooden Man Chamber. San De and D.S. are flanking Drew as he pauses in
front of the door. Drew turns to look at San De, and the D.S. smacks
Drew in the back of the head.</p>
<p><strong>d.s.</strong>: My last chance � when you come out the other
side, we will be equals.</p>
<p><strong>establishing shot of wooden man chamber.</strong>: Drew
pauses for a moment, examining the room. It is filled with wooden
statues of monks, all in different fighting positions. The carvings are
precise and incredibly beautiful. Their arms, open hands, fists and legs
are fashioned out of hard wood, and they look very dangerous indeed.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: I can’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>d.s.</strong>: There is no can’t, only won’t.</p>
<p><strong>angle on drew</strong>: Who gathers himself, straightens up
and takes a deep breath, forcing it out in a breathing exercise.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: I am a Shaolin monk.</p>
<p><strong>angle on drew</strong>: As he relaxes his face, and forcibly
relaxes his arm and entire body, letting his inner energy take over.</p>
<p><strong>angle on drew</strong>: Holding up the heavy stone panel with
his arm, his face and body completely relaxed. The panel goes back up
into the ceiling, and the door opens. The whirling statue slows, and
then stops altogether. Drew reaches up with a hook kick and taps it in
the face.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Not this time.</p>
<p><strong>san de</strong>: You are now Shaolin. We welcome you into our
ranks as fighting monks…</p>
<p><strong>angle on drew, gao and li</strong>: As they congratulate
themselves, and gorge themselves on the huge</p>
<p><strong>angle on the entire group</strong>: They are enjoying
themselves. This only happens once every couple of years, and the monks
are intent on enjoying themselves.</p>
<p><strong>angle on san de</strong>: Who is walking towards the side of
the temple, away from the party.</p>
<p><strong>angle on drew</strong>: Who sees him leave. He excuses
himself from his group.</p>
<p><strong>san de</strong>: That monk was me.</p>
<p><strong>angle on drew</strong>: Who digests this. He smiles a
little.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Anything.</p>
<p><strong>san de</strong>: Before you leave for American, can you help
at an international tournament in Beijing? The Shaolin temple has an
entry, and he will be fighting men from all over the world � I’d like
you to be there.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: No problem. Without pause.</p>
<p><strong>san de</strong>: Now, a friend would like to see you.</p>
<p><strong>angle on side of the ring</strong>: Where Li, Gao, San De,
D.S. and some others are waiting. They are all in monastic garb. Drew
and Ashema walk up to them, holding hands. Drew is dressed in a fighting
monk’s costume as well, and he bows to his fellow monks.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Did you think he would get into the
finals?</p>
<p><strong>san de</strong>: Who could know? He fights the winner of the
Western countries, which is why I wanted you here.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: I’ll help any way I can.</p>
<p><strong>angle on the crowd</strong>: As it parts to let someone
through. Drew turns casually to look at the competitor. Slowly, a
figure, followed by a large group of people, comes clear… it is
Trevor!</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: He take a vow of silence too? Nice hair,
Drew. If he took a vow of chastity too, honey, you see me after this
fight, ’Kay?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Wish me luck, huh?</p>
<p><strong>angle on the ring</strong>: As Trevor and the Shaolin entry
bow to each other. The fight begins. It isn’t even close. Trevor is
better than he ever was. He is incredible, and he destroys the Shaolin
fighter. Oblivious to the boos and whistles from the crowd, he plays
with the Shaolin fighter, making him look like a real fool.</p>
<p><strong>intercut reaction shots of drew</strong>: Who is watching the
destruction. Behind his eyes, he is reliving his humiliation.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: I want the American Shaolin!</p>
<p><strong>angle on trevor</strong>: Pointing and yelling for Drew.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: I came to the Shaolin Temple because of you,
Trevor. You humiliated me, and I wanted to make sure it could never
happen again.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: So, let’s see what you’ve learned.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: I’ve learned that… there’s nothing to prove.
Beating you is no longer important. It was my ego that had to be
defeated, not you.</p>
<p><strong>angle on san de and d.s.</strong>: Who know what is happening
and are proud of Drew, prouder than they have ever been.</p>
<p><strong>angle on trevor</strong>: Who is seething.</p>
<p><strong>angle on drew</strong>: His face calm.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: No, master. I will not fight for personal
glory, or for my ego.</p>
<p><strong>san de</strong>: You have learned much.</p>
<p><strong>gao</strong>: Someone should face him in combat. For the
tradition of the temple.</p>
<p><strong>san de</strong>: There are some times when a Shaolin must
fight, and some people who will not learn until they are taught a
lesson.</p>
<p><strong>angle on drew</strong>: Who understands the implication of
what he is saying. He starts to smile slowly.</p>
<p><strong>san de</strong>: It’s your call.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: For the temple…</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Remember last time, punk?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Nothing exists but the moment, and…</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Stay still, dammit! Stand and fight!</p>
<p><strong>angle on san de and d.s.</strong>: Who knew the message all
along.</p>
<p><strong>wide angle of entire ring</strong>: Drew and Trevor standing
together in the center. The monks on the side climb into the ring to
celebrate with Drew.</p>
<p><strong>angle on san de</strong>: Who is not used to shows of
affection. He is lost for a moment, then his face softens and he returns
Drew’s embrace. They break and bow again, and San De moves off. Drew
stands there holding the Golden Sash, the rising sun of the first day of
the rest of his life shining in the b.g.</p>
<p><strong>angle on ashema</strong>: Who comes up to Drew, taking his
arm and walks with him along the Great Wall.</p>
