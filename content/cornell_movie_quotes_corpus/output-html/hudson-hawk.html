<p><strong>unforgettable juggler</strong>: Leonardo, che pazzo.</p>
<p><strong>da vinci</strong>: Basta vapore.</p>
<p><strong>apprentice two</strong>: Maestro, che meraviglia!</p>
<p><strong>apprentice three</strong>: Lei e’ proprio fantastico!</p>
<p><strong>da vinci</strong>: Lasciatemi, solo. Solo!</p>
<p><strong>da vinci</strong>: L’ho fatto.</p>
<p><strong>wise guard</strong>: We’re losing our biggest celebrity
today.</p>
<p><strong>young guard</strong>: You’re kidding, Petey the Paint Thinner
Killer is getting paroled?</p>
<p><strong>wise guard</strong>: Not that slime, you Fizzhead. Hudson
Hawk. The last of the great cat burglars.</p>
<p><strong>wise guard</strong>: As a thief, Hawk was a poem. Iambic
fucking pentameter. You know, Crime used to have a little class. A
hundred reporters were here when he came in, now they’re probably out
covering some tired crack gang war…</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Remind me to fire my publicist.</p>
<p><strong>young guard</strong>: Darn, these are for L-block…</p>
<p><strong>young guard</strong>: - go back down to security and-</p>
<p><strong>wise guard</strong>: Guess this means, Hawk, you’ll be able
to let yourself back in…</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Never happen. Bet. Ten bucks.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Oh, give this back to Petey in A block. Tell
him it was a sweet gift, but I think he got some wrong ideas about our
friendship.</p>
<p><strong>young guard</strong>: The Paint Thinner Killer did this? I
think you picked a good day to get out…</p>
<p><strong>wise guard</strong>: Hope I lose the bet. Have that
cappuccino on me.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: You got it. A double.</p>
<p><strong>antony</strong>: Welcome back, buddy ol’ pal. We’ve got a
proposition…</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Answer’s no, not even if you bathe. Cesar
Mario, Antony Mario, how’s the “Family?” Kill any monkeys lately?</p>
<p><strong>cesar</strong>: How many times do I have to say it? I didn’t
put the hit on Little Eddie… Never had anything against that kooky
chimp. I actually found him, “endearing.”</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Sure. Face down. Two endearing shots to the
back of the head. That’s your mark, man. What did Little Eddie ever do
to…</p>
<p><strong>cesar</strong>: You’re hitting Rutherford’s Auction House.
Easy as my brother’s wife. Directions are in the bag. Just open the
seventh floor safe and take out the thingie…</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Or you cut off my thingie. Directions even
your brother would understand.</p>
<p><strong>antony</strong>: Yeah, directions even I could
understand.</p>
<p><strong>cesar</strong>: Hawk, you’re a great thief. Got set up, did
some time, nothing to be ashamed of. Don’t give me a sonata about you
always just really wanted to settle down, open a hardware Store and sell
spatulas…</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: If the Mario brothers weren’t Jersey’s third
largest family, I’d say kiss my ass. But considering your status, I’ll
say slurp my butt.</p>
<p><strong>cesar</strong>: What’s your favorite sport, Hawk?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Baseball, why?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: I meant, ping pong. Listen, I’d rather go back
in than whore for you… Oh, I need to borrow ten dollars.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Help? Police?</p>
<p><strong>cesar</strong>: You need some time to think. That’s cool, but
next time, I’m not going to say “Please.”</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: I don’t believe this. I’ve been out forty
seconds…</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: That’s the first thing I did. Smooch the
ground and taste the freedom. Sorry I was late. Miss anything?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Your timing, and your shoes, are impeccable…
Good to see you, Alex, been having a lousy day.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Lousy day? The man’s getting out of prison and
he’s having a lousy day. What, you missing out on the Cell Block Water
Ballet pageant? Believe me, it’s overrated.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Where’s the kiss? No tongue this time, I
promise.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Looks like you’ve been expanding your…</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Don’t say it, Hawkins. I’m incredibly
sensitive about my fucking figure.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: My next word was gonna be “consciousness.”
Swear to God… tubby.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: That’s your definition of “Hard?”</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Show off. Hey, boss tune. “Come Fly with
Me.”</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Three minutes, 51 seconds.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Still do the puzzles, still know the running
times of songs, and I’ll bet you’re still the best damn cat burg–</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Not anymore. Now I’m the laziest damn cat
burg–I’m going to take it so straight that I won’t tape a Mets game
without the expressed written consent of the National Baseball
League.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Now that you’re born again,what do you wanna
do? Statue of Liberty? Entertain some ladies? Miss Saigon tix? Seduce
some women? Play Nintendo? Bone some chicks?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Come on, Alex, let’s just get to Alex’s. Your
bar’s the only place that’s going to cheer me. God, I’d kill for a damn
cappuccino. What the hell’s a Nintendo?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Oh man, you still got a thing for those
unmasculine European coffees? Who’s your buddy?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: The man knows, the man knows!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: So Mr. Coffee, what went down outside the
prison?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Oh, not much. Mario Brothers want me to do a
job.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Those dago-guinea-I can say this shit I’m
Italian-wop motherfu–</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Ah, had the perfect amount of foam. Just get
me to the bar… It’s the one good thing in my life that’ll never
change….</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I didn’t know how to tell you. A couple
brokers stopped in for Stoley Spritzers one night. Next thing I know
Fast Track Digest votes us “Watering Hole of the Month.” Now, I’m
shopping for Aqua Salmon wallpaper.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: I read about these people in Newsweek. Where’s
all the regulars, Crazy Jeff Cava, the Todd sisters, Indian Joe? Where’s
Ed Kranepool’s autograph? Captain Bob’s steering wheel?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Hey, get this irritable guy a cappuccino. I
gotta go be a boss.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: This is Pizza? Reindeer Goat cheese? I admit,
I’ve been known to go wild and order a Canadian Bacon in my time,
but..</p>
<p><strong>tortoise shell non-smoker</strong>: Can you read….
smoker?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Can you take a sunrise and sprinkle it with
dew?</p>
<p><strong>tortoise shell non-smoker</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: The Candy Man can, Felix. You know, I thought
this was a country where you could do any stupid thing you wanted; drive
to work naked, make love to a V.C.R. Guess I’m wrong. Maybe that’s why I
became a serial arsonist.</p>
<p><strong>tortoise shell non-smoker</strong>: Hey, it’s okay, big guy.
Smoke all you want. Have mine….</p>
<p><strong>gates</strong>: You’re under arrest…</p>
<p><strong>gates</strong>: Have a seat. Good to see you, buddy ol’
pal…</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: The pleasure’s all yours, Officer Gates.</p>
<p><strong>gates</strong>: Why do you show your parole officer such
disrespect? Especially after I got you such a nice job.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: What job?</p>
<p><strong>gates</strong>: The auction house, asshole. One night’s work
and you’re free like no ex-con’s ever been. No checking in with a
shrink, no community service teaching retards how to play air hockey.
It’s a great deal, I can’t lie.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: The only thing you can’t do is get sex for
free. I know I was in prison for like basically the 80’s, but, call me
daffy, aren’t you supposed to stop me from committing crimes. You know,
Book-em-Dano, Call-for-backup, Give-a-Hoot-Don’t-Pollute.</p>
<p><strong>gates</strong>: You wouldn’t be out if it wasn’t for me! I
did dog and pony for you! You think they would have let you out after
what you did, you told the board members they looked like the Three
Stooges…</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: How was I supposed to know they were women?
Besides one of them was bald and kept saying “Soitinly.”</p>
<p><strong>gates</strong>: Remember that guy in the cell next to you who
hung himself?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>gates</strong>: Remember that shoe you lost…</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Uh, yeah. Cut to the chase.</p>
<p><strong>gates</strong>: One phone call and your shoe will become a
piece of evidence and that suicide’ll become a murder.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: What else do you got under there … I don’t
want to be rude, but this is all pretty lame.</p>
<p><strong>gates</strong>: That’s the beauty. It’s bullshit, but I can
make it stick because I’m a good guy parole officer and you re a bad guy
who’s about to find out that there’s a thin line between ex-con and
escape con.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: How is everything tonight, sir?</p>
<p><strong>gates</strong>: Beat it, Alex. You’re a dinosaur.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Alex, did you know this ape was going to be
here…</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Sure. That’s why his meatballs are made out of
marinated Chuck Wagon.</p>
<p><strong>gates</strong>: You’re full of shit.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: No, man, actually you are. Just add water and
it makes its own gravy. Keeps your teeth healthy and your coat
shiny.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Hmmmm…..</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Yo Pandora, quit hummm-ing… look at this.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: It’s Captain Bob’s steering wheel! Remember
when the Captain…..</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Hmmm, nasty little safe on the 7th.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: The safe’s a Simpson 71. Last time I played
the game, Simpson only had a 40.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Just means it’ll take you an extra 31 seconds
to seduce. You re still the best, I know it.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: But you got three guards who… Shit, what am I
doing? Where’s the want ads? Gonna sell some spatulas.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Hey, I’m sorry, man. I’m putting out a fire
with kerosene.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: This isn’t funny. I’m not into this. I…</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: There goes five seconds…My record’s
eighteen.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: You’re not…LISTENING!</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: I’m sorr–Goddamn Mario Brothers. Goddamn
Gates. Goddamn Rutherford Auction House. By the way, how many
seconds?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Rutherford Auction… that name…</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Alex!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Don’t wet your diapers. I’ll have to change
them. “Witchcraft.” What’s the running time?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: 3:48. I can’t get you involved, man. This is
my sewage and… God, you love all this, don’t you, you bastard. Haven’t
you ever heard of stamp collecting, or curling?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I’m in. Have you seen the public service
announcements for Diabetes. We can ride horses, play LaCrosse, and knock
off auction houses. I got a plan. You won’t have to hail Cesar or
Gates.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: I’m a bum.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Whoa, you better cut a bigger hole than
that.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Hey, you promised……Don’t worry, I’m wearing my
girdle.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Cameras?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: No need. Guards’ station’s right there.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: They record everything their video
surveillance takes in…</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Yes, master-thief, I can see that. You said
something about a plan…</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Am I boring you, smartass? Watch. A little
rewind and re-wire action and the Guards are going to be watching a
rerun and miss out on our exciting episode.</p>
<p><strong>security guard one</strong>: Check out Big Stan… Big
Stan!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: You got about five minutes and change.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: 5:32. “Swinging on a Star.”</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: You know they invented something while you
were inside. Called a watch.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: “A mule is an animal with long funny
ears.”</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: “He kicks up at anything he hears.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: “Or would you rather swing on a star, carry
moonbeams home in a jar.”</p>
<p><strong>security guard two</strong>: Hell-o. Check the Power room,
bud…</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: swing on a star, carry moonbeams…</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: “Or would you rather be a fish?”</p>
<p><strong>big stan</strong>: Very funny.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: “A fish is annuh nan na nan na brook.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: “He can’t write his name or read a book. To
fool people is his only thought.”</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: “And though he’s slippery, he still gets
caught.”</p>
<p><strong>security guard two</strong>: Uh, Jerry. I’m looking at the
seventh floor and I don’t know how to say this, I see the Blue
Chair.</p>
<p><strong>security guard one</strong>: What the… You think that’s
weird, check out screen two…..</p>
<p><strong>security guard two</strong>: Somebody rewired the
recorders!</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: “And all the monkeys aren’t in the zoo.”</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: “Every day you meet quite a few.”</p>
<p><strong>hawk and alex</strong>: “So you see it’s all up to you. You
can be better than you are. You could be swinging on a star.”</p>
<p><strong>security guard one</strong>: Shit, let’s roll!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: The song’s over! Come on! “You could be
swinging on a star.”</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: What am I doing here? There are so many things
I wanna do that aren’t this. Paint a lighthouse. Kiss a woman in
Italy.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: “You could be swinging on a star.”</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Paint a woman in a lighthou–I don’t want to
steal a horse. Life is…</p>
<p>****: “You could be swinging on a star.” You couldn’t have waited to
see a psychiatrist. No, you had…</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Let’s go down the freight elevator.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Keep those ideas coming.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I’m not as unpleasantly plump as that Guard am
I.</p>
<p><strong>hawk and alex</strong>: I got a bad feeling….</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: I can’t even swim.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Hell, the fall’ll probably kill ya…</p>
<p><strong>gates</strong>: Hudson Hawkins gets the chair of honor. How
about a Gates-arita? I used real hot dogs.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Weren’t you the bartender at Jonestown?</p>
<p><strong>cesar</strong>: Good job, not pretty, but good.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Ah, the mafia, the cops; do I know how to
party or what?</p>
<p><strong>gates</strong>: All this trouble for a horsey. I may not know
art, but I know what I like.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: You certainly do.</p>
<p><strong>gates</strong>: So when’s that Sebastian-Cabot-
Buckingham-Palace-looking- Butlerhead getting here?</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Any minute now, dear Mr. Gates.</p>
<p><strong>gates</strong>: Oh, sorry Jeeves. Gates-arita?</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: I’ll pass. May I?</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Ah, such craftsmanship. Leonardo Da Vinci’s
last commission for the Duke of Milan. Irreplaceable.</p>
<p><strong>gates</strong>: Hey, Mr. French, I’m delirious for you. Now
where’s my cut?</p>
<p><strong>gates</strong>: You son-of-a……I don’t believe this! You come
into my house!</p>
<p><strong>gates</strong>: I ought to take Big Ben and shove it up your
limey blimey bunghole!</p>
<p><strong>gates</strong>: Like I said. Where’s my cu-u-…</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: So much for his “cut.” Excuse my dry British
humor.</p>
<p><strong>cesar</strong>: Lovely work, Alfred, taking the Concorde
back?</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Indeed I am, Mr. Mario. I’m really racking
up those frequent flyer points…</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: I hate to interrrupt you two lovebirds…</p>
<p><strong>antony</strong>: You know, I think Gates promised Hawk a cut,
too….</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Ta ta, Hudson Hawk.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Too-do-loo, babe.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Did I miss anything?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Oh, not much. Gates just had his tonsils taken
out. The hard way.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Geez, Gates was killed. Who do we send the
thank you note to?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: The Butler did it. Guy was a cross between
Alistair Cook and a Cuisinart. Dude took Mr. Ed and humptied dumptied it
over Gates’s head. He said it was made by, get this, Leonardo..</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Ah yes, a rare Renaissance piece. Da Vinci’s
“Sforza,” an equestrian model of a never executed statue. I consider it
to be the prize of tonight’s auction of objets d’equestrian. Horse
things.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Okay, you got me, Mr. PBS.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Morning edition. Seems two thieves “attempted”
to steal it last night, but thanks to three “courageous” guards, it will
be ready for tonight.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: “Attempted.” At-tempt-ted! I’m not happy about
having to steal that horse, but I do have my pride. Face it, when it
comes to burglary, and sex, I….</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Boing. Uh, this I don t understand…</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Why try?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Because I’m tired of not understanding things.
Cops, Mafia, and butlers forcing me to bust my ass to steal something,
which it turns out I really didn’t steal–it’s fucked up.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: You re not thinking of going to…</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Alex, my man, it’s time to play a little
offense. Where’s your tux?</p>
<p><strong>eccentric bald auctioneer</strong>: …fan-taas-tic example of
Florentine marble… Who will start at 160,000…160,000……180,000.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: All these years of attending auctions, I still
get goosebumps. The paintings, the sculptures….the things that aren’t
really paintings or sculptures…</p>
<p><strong>the woman</strong>: …. the pretentious vultures who don’t
even look up from their calculators to see what they’re buying. Now that
gives me goosebumps. Auctions are disgusting.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: I couldn’t agree more. Savages.</p>
<p><strong>eccentric bald auctioneer</strong>: Lot Fifteen, an
equestrian sconce attributed to the Cellini school..</p>
<p><strong>eccentric bald auctioneer</strong>: Sold! To the caller from
Newfoundland.</p>
<p><strong>eccentric bald autioneer</strong>: And finally, Lot number
17, thought to be lost in the war, and again last night, the Da Vinci
“Sforza,” the jewel of the sale. Fan-taas-tic…</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Is looking like a constipated warthog a
prerequisite to getting a job in the art world?</p>
<p><strong>eccentric bald auctioneer</strong>: There have naturally been
questions of its authenticity, so to verify we have Doctor Anna Baragli
of the Vatican. Doc?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Some of us warthogs are more constipated than
others.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Oh, the shit is going to hit the fa–</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Fantastic. Perfection. The Vatican extends its
jealousy to the lucky bidder.</p>
<p><strong>eccentric bald auctioneer</strong>: We’ll begin the bidding
at 82.5 million dollars. To you, sir. Eighty-three, Ninety–your bid,
madame–Ninety point five…..</p>
<p><strong>darwin mayflower</strong>: lOO million clams, Francesco!</p>
<p><strong>eccentric bald auctioneer</strong>: 100 million dollars to
Mr. Darwin Mayflower.</p>
<p><strong>minerva</strong>: Francesco, 100 million and one.</p>
<p><strong>darwin</strong>: Outbid by my own wench, quelle bummere.</p>
<p><strong>minerva</strong>: Poor baby….. Here, Bunny.</p>
<p><strong>eccentric bald auctioneer</strong>: Fan-taas-tic, the bid is
at 100 million and one dollars.</p>
<p><strong>eccentric bald auctioneer</strong>: Go-ing!</p>
<p><strong>eccentric bald auctioneer</strong>: Go-ing!</p>
<p><strong>eccentric bald auctioneer</strong>: Gone!</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: My God, that was bold of you, you didn’t have
to do that…</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Forget about it–it was nothing– anybody would
have done the same thing–It’s an impulse…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: No, I meant you didn’t have to tackle me and
rip my dress. A polite push, perhaps? A clear shout of “watch out, Anna”
would have done nicely…</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Excuse me, Milady. I would have flown over and
carried you up to a pink cloud, but I left my cape at the cleaners.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Thanks tough guy, thanks a lot. Why was the
guard chasing you?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Because Danger, Doc, is my middle…</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Saint Pete, hey I know, the whole cat burglar
thing, it sounds bad, but I’ll take the worst cloud you got…</p>
<p><strong>cesar</strong>: News flash. You’re not in heaven. Yet. 30
seconds and counting, if you know what I’m saying. Couldn’t just play
along, could you…</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Pretty class way of covering your tracks. I
think that auctioneer landed at La Guardia.</p>
<p><strong>antony</strong>: Subtlety was never one of our strong
points.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Neither’s flossing.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Life don’t get much better than this.</p>
<p><strong>cesar</strong>: Make him into Roadkill!</p>
<p><strong>antony</strong>: Yeah, run him down!</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: This is the worst night…</p>
<p><strong>snickers</strong>: When it rains, it pours. Name’s Snickers.
The plane leaves in 40.</p>
<p><strong>almond joy</strong>: Almond Joy. I know, pretty silly. But
it’s better than when we first started out, our code names were
Diseases. You don’t know what it’s like being called Clymidia for a
year. Whoops, forgot….</p>
<p><strong>butterfinger</strong>: My name’s Butterfinger.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: No shit.</p>
<p><strong>kaplan</strong>: Don’t you just hate kids…</p>
<p><strong>almond joy</strong>: George, you promised. No Old CIA/ New
CIA jokes…</p>
<p><strong>kaplan</strong>: I call them the MTV.I.A. Punks think Bay of
Pigs is an herbal tea. They think the Cold War involves penguins
and…</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Don’t I know you…</p>
<p><strong>kaplan</strong>: You just might. I’m the guy who tricked you
into robbing a government installation and then had you sent to prison
for it. At the time, I was bald with a beard, no moustache, and I had a
different nose, so if you don’t recognize me, I won’t be offended.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Bastard, you’re going to need another
nose!</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: But I’m not the type of guy to hold a
grudge.</p>
<p><strong>kaplan</strong>: I used you as a diversion. while you were
getting captured upstairs, I was shredding documents in the basement.
Deep down, I guess I was just jealous. You were one incredible
thief…</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: To what do I owe the dishonor of a reunion,
you centrally intelligent scumsicle.</p>
<p><strong>kaplan</strong>: I Want to make things up to you. That’s why
I got you this gig, doll. Hawk, my name’s George Kaplan and to quote the
late, great Karen Carpenter, “We’ve only just begun.”</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Three minutes, twenty-three seconds. If you
think I’m doing another…</p>
<p><strong>kaplan</strong>: Hush. My employer wants a meeting.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Employer? The president?</p>
<p><strong>kaplan</strong>: No, somebody powerful. Oh. Look. what’s that
up there?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: I’m supposed to fall for that?</p>
<p><strong>kaplan</strong>: Shucks. Guess not.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: No. Way.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Welcome to Rome, sir.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Yes way.</p>
<p><strong>darwin</strong>: For those kind of wages, I could have built
the factory in America! They’re Vietnamese, can’t we just give them more
Bart Simpson shirts? I hear depressing news like this and I want to
commit genocide! Alfred, hold my calls. So, Hawk! The Hawkster! What do
you think of the vehicle?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: You could host American Bandstand in here. Why
did you duck at the auction, asshole?</p>
<p><strong>darwin</strong>: Because I didn’t want to get hurt,
taterhead.</p>
<p><strong>darwin</strong>: What can I tell you, I’m the villain.
Initially it was a priority to keep a lot of buffers between you and me,
but since most of them are dead now, I thought what the heck. Hawk, you
come highly recommended. I would have done some things differently at
the auction house, but hey, I want to be in business with you.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: My life is not some deal. I…</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: It’s Boston, Mr. Mayflower.</p>
<p><strong>darwin</strong>: I’m sorry, I have to take this. Those are
valid points though…</p>
<p><strong>darwin</strong>: You better have a good excuse… You better
have a better excuse! You are so weak! I’m only thankful your ancestors
didn’t settle America or else my name would be Running Brave or Vomiting
Antelope…Really. Well, listen close, babe.</p>
<p><strong>darwin</strong>: Shall we?</p>
<p><strong>darwin</strong>: So Hawkasaurus, I won’t mince words…</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Whatever. You own Boardwalk, you own Park
Place, you own the four railroads. You think you’re God. For all I know,
you’re probably right. I just wanted to have a damn cappuccino, maybe
play some Nintendo after I find out what it is. Man, why didn’t you just
buy the horse? What am I saying, you did buy it…</p>
<p><strong>darwin</strong>: Oh… Let’s see. There are organizations that
think we wanted the “Sforza” for reasons other than putting it in the Da
Vinci museum we’re building in Vinci. Hopefully, these organizations
think our plan has been ruined with the explosion of our replica. If I
seem vague, grand. We want a low profile on this, that’s why I got
Kaplan and the Candy bars involved. I helped George help the Mario
Brothers and Gates help get you out….</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: If you’re pausing for a “thank you,” give it
up. So boss, you going to tell me what the crystal piece inside the pony
means?</p>
<p><strong>darwin</strong>: Way to go, Alfie! How many people did you
break that thing in front of. Good help’s hard to find.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: I guess that’s a no.</p>
<p><strong>darwin</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen of the board…</p>
<p><strong>darwin</strong>: And Min-er-va. Let’s give it up for Hudson
Hawk.</p>
<p><strong>minerva</strong>: Hello……Bunny, Ball-Ball!</p>
<p><strong>darwin</strong>: Hawkmeister, we got you clothes, great
hotel, and a 250,000 lira per diem.</p>
<p><strong>minerva</strong>: That’s two hundred dollars a day? So he can
get a hooker and some tequila. Veto, Darwin.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Guess I know who wears the penis in this
family.</p>
<p><strong>minerva</strong>: For God’s sake, chain this convict.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Alfred, you’re a very polite psychopath, but
if you…</p>
<p><strong>minerva</strong>: We want Da Vinci’s sketchbook, what do they
call it, the Codex.</p>
<p><strong>darwin</strong>: Listen Hawk, this might be hard to believe,
but I’m a regular joe. I just want to be happy and happiness comes from
the achieving of goals. It’s just when you make your first billion by
the age of 19, it’s hard to keep coming up with new ones. But now
finally I got my new goal. World domination. With your help…Bunny….quit
that!</p>
<p><strong>minerva</strong>: Bunny, ball-ball! Bad bunny!</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Think he’s already got today’s ball-balls.
Five more minutes please, it’s been so long…</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Anybody have a cigarette? But seriously, do me
a favor and Concorde me back to prison. I don’t care anymore. I hope you
have the receipts for the threads.</p>
<p><strong>minerva</strong>: You go back, you won’t be alone. You’ll
have a diabetic barkeep cellmate. You’re still young enough to have fun
shanking child molesters for a pack of smokes, but “Alex” will go in
knowing that the next time he gets out it’ll be to attend his own
funeral. Depressing.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: You wouldn’t risk the dime to call the police.
You have no proof.</p>
<p><strong>darwin</strong>: Ah, the magic word…</p>
<p><strong>darwin</strong>: It’s veja du, Hawkhead. Something you wish
never happened. We shot the entire operation with hidden cameras behind
the hidden cameras. Hired the guy who did the last Sports Illustrated
Swimsuit issue. Excellent work… whoops, damn Fotomat assholes…</p>
<p><strong>minerva</strong>: Tomorrow, you’re going to hit a church.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: I’m robbing the Vatican. The nuns at St. Agnes
predicted that I’d end up doing this…</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Excuse me, I’m being blackmailed into robbing
the Vatican by a psychotic American corporation along with a CIA…</p>
<p><strong>vatican guard</strong>: “You’re being”…..uh, I don’t, uh…</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Forget it, man. Go tackle a jaywalker.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Operator, I want to make a collect call to
Alex Messina, New York….</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: But it is his gift as an inventor who drew
together science and art that is most incredible.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Tough guy. What are you–How’s your head.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Yes, and my giraffe loves it, too…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: As you know, the Da Vinci Codex, has lived in
the Vatican for centuries and will continue to live here for centuries
more.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: That’s what you theenk.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Question, sir? His untiring pen predicted the
airplane, the submarine, the bicycle, the helicopter, and even the
tank.</p>
<p><strong>little brat</strong>: This is so bor-ing! Do you hate Italy
as much as I do, Pokey? Si, senor! Italy sucks the big one! why can’t we
go to the Epcot Center!</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: These more dangerous designs inspired him to
develop a secret code that ….</p>
<p><strong>little brat</strong>: Pokey, come back!</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Come on, this stuff will knock you out. Have
you ever had the feeling you were being followed, Mr. Bond.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Never, why do you ask?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Whoa. Name’s Hawkins, Eddie Hawkins. My
nickname’s Hudson Hawk, but don’t call me Hudson, not even as a joke.
The Nuns at St. Agnes called me that and they’re the ones who helped
make me what I am today. Not a compliment…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Sure Hudson. Are you going to tell me why you
did that back there or are you going to blame it on Dumbo?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Could you believe that crazy elephant?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Whoa, part 2. Does it go to Times Square?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Delivers up to ten at night. The Pope has an
obsession with his Easter Seals. It’s actually not that an unusual
set-up. The secret passageway on the other hand….</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: The Vatican is made of constant mysteries
meant to be enjoyed, not explained.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Nice. But right out of our brochure.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Oh, you read that.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Actually I wrote it. It’s a good sentence. It
can apply to people.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: You’re not an unmysterious thang yourself.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I don’t steal stuffed elephants from little
girls. And I buy my own clothes. My life’s a little boring…</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: God, I wish I could say the same thing. What
about having a nice, dull dinner with me tonight. Scrabble, Knock-knock
jokes, Anecdotes about famous dead Italians….</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I’ll bring my entire repertoire…</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: And I’ll bring my entourage…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Secret passageways don’t mean as much as they
used to. There’s a place two blocks east of here. Enzo’s. Say 10:30.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Said.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Father, it’s obvious. He’s up to
something.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>cardinal</strong>: Did he mention the Mayflowers?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: No, your Eminence. I think he’s going to steal
the Codex, as early as next week.</p>
<p><strong>cardinal</strong>: Attempt, you mean. The vanity of this man,
Hudson Hawk. The Vatican has foiled the advances of Pirates and
Terrorists. We will not lie down for some schmuck from New Jersey. Must
you flirt with him so realistically?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: That’s the best kind. A wise woman once said
“Polite conversation is rarely either.”</p>
<p><strong>cardinal</strong>: Let me be the one to quote Scripture. ….As
an agent of our organization, you are put in awkward situations. Just
remember, Hudson Hawk is an evil, evil man.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Yeah. The big E.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Hello, operator. I’d like to make a collect
call to New York number…</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Thank you, operator, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Come on, Alex, pick up, you Reindeer goat
cheese-eating motherfucker.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: A-lex, A-lex, come on Alex.</p>
<p><strong>kaplan</strong>: Hawk, Hawk, Hawk. Enjoying Italy? I always
had a soft spot for Rome. Did my first barehanded strangulation here.
Communist politician.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Why George, you big softie…</p>
<p><strong>kaplan</strong>: God, I miss communism. The Red Threat.
People were scared, the Agency was respected, and I got laid every
night.</p>
<p><strong>butterfinger</strong>: Sorry, coach…</p>
<p><strong>kaplan</strong>: If his father wasn’t the head of Shit, I
hate this, the government’s got me farmed out, working for the Mayflower
corporation now, money beats politics. War isn’t Hell anymore, it’s
Dull. Don’t slaughter their men and rape their women, just steal their
microchips.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: You know Kaplan, if you weren’t the slimiest
pinata of shit that ever lived, I’d feel sorry for you.</p>
<p><strong>snickers</strong>: Good news, bud, the Mayflowers have moved
up the time-table. You’re hitting the Vatican to-night.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Tonight? You’re whacked. The timing’s off, I’m
underequipped Damnit, I have a date!</p>
<p><strong>almond joy</strong>: Grapple, Biker’s bottle, hairspray,
black turtleneck, Pocket Fisherman, acid, collapsible yardstick,
softball, and 72 stamps. Gee Stud, this is going to be some date. No
Harvey’s Bristol Cream?</p>
<p><strong>kaplan</strong>: Snickers, make the list happen. Oh and it’s
one thing to play hide and seek with the Mayflower’s pathetic staff, but
we’re sore losers. I’ve put jumper cables on the nipples of children and
not always in the line of duty.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Thanks for sharing.</p>
<p><strong>kaplan</strong>: We blow up space shuttles for breakfast. You
and your friend Alex would be a late afternoon Triscuit.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: If you do anything to my friend…</p>
<p><strong>kaplan</strong>: Yeah, right. By the way, as long as I’m
getting things off my chest, I’m the one who killed your little monkey.
Made it look like a Mafia hit. Did it for fun. Ciao.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: What did you have against Little Eddie,
motherfucker? He was just a monkey who liked to laugh. Come back without
your yuppie army. I’ll triscuit you, you space shuttle eating…Shit.!</p>
<p><strong>butterfinger</strong>: Hey, Mr. Hawk, I got those 72
stamps!</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: “Beware the Odd Steps.”</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Why Kit Kat, aren’t you a gentleman…</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Please God, Please God…….let the guard shoot
me.</p>
<p><strong>vatican guard</strong>: The worm’s on the other foot, yankee
noodle candy.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Oh Hudson, I was worried you weren’t going to
drop by….</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: I never break a date. Scout’s honor.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Fettucini con Funghi Porcini.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Bellissimo, signor.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Oh, and could I have some ketchup with
that.</p>
<p><strong>snickers</strong>: Come on, Pierre, Steak-bur-ger, Fren-n-ch
Fries. This is France, you gotta have French…..</p>
<p><strong>almond joy</strong>: Actually we’re in Italy, Snickers, she
said as if it made a difference.</p>
<p><strong>snickers</strong>: Italy, France, Moscow. They all just wanna
be Nebraska. Old Man Kaplan thinks since Communism is dead, we got
nothing to do. Man, Democracy isn’t free elections. We gotta teach the
world that Democracy is Big Tits, College Football on Saturdays, Eddie
Murphy saying the word “Fuck” and Kids putting their hands down garbage
disposals on “America’s Funniest Home Videos.”</p>
<p><strong>almond joy</strong>: Damn baby, when’s the last time you had
a vacation…Jesus, I gotta get out of this job. If my Mom knew her
daughter assassinated the leader of the anti-Apartheid movement….</p>
<p><strong>snickers</strong>: Quit bitching, you got the employee of the
month plaque for that shit…Ah to be in Pari-is and in love.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: This is bueno. They had the worst ketchup in
prison…..uh…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Prison?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: I was the Warden?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: How long were you in?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Let’s just say, I never saw E.T.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Wow, you were “in the joint.” “Doing hard
time.” It’s funny, but that excites me. I seem to have a thing for
sinners.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: I seem to have a thing for sinning. sinning.
Check please….</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Ah, anything for dessert?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Yes. Something to go.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: I’ll bring the ketchup.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: What have you been doing?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Uh….old badminton injury.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: tickles, ticKleS, TICKLES.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Oh, I’m so sorry…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I’m sorry. I can’t. I….</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Hey now, outside of a very friendly dog this
morning, it’s been a slow decade. I don’t make love every ten years, I
get a little cranky.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: It’s also been a long time for me. I–</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Catholic girls are scary…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Somebody robbed the Vatican.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Oh. No.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: It’s not what you think. Okay, maybe it
is….</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You really went and did it. With one day, not
even a day, of planning, you did it. Nobody does it better, Hudson. You
started the week stealing the Sforza and you ended it swiping the
Codex.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Wha–</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: What are your plans for the weekend? Hoisting
away the Colosseum? Tell me, did the devil make you do it or did Darwin
and Minerva Mayflower?</p>
<p><strong>snickers</strong>: What’s going on in there?</p>
<p><strong>butterfinger</strong>: Do you want me to rape them? Dunkin
does it better.</p>
<p><strong>snickers</strong>: Just read, Butterfinger.</p>
<p><strong>butterfinger</strong>: “Da Vinci had fears about his more
dangerous designs, so he created a shorthand code in reverse
script…”</p>
<p><strong>almond joy</strong>: To yourself!…..What are they doing? In
twenty seconds, we go in.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: For two years, I’ve been tracking the
Mayflowers’ peculiar interest in three Da Vinci pieces. Their Sforza
replica was as fake as the “gas leak” that supposedly destroyed it.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Does everyone in the world know more than me?
Jesus, I’m just some guy who happens to be good at swiping
stuff…..Lifted a piece of licorice when I was one and a half. Who knew
it would lead… They even got the CIA involved!</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: The C.I. what? God, no…</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Ooh, I guess I do know something Here’s
looking at you, kid…</p>
<p><strong>almond joy</strong>: Now.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: This doesn’t taste like cappuccino.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Oh, I must have put too much ethyl-chloride in
it.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Why didn’t you tell me at the restaurant that
he had hit the Vatican tonight. My people will not be happy. I want to
see Kaplan.</p>
<p><strong>almond joy</strong>: That’s not overly possible. He…</p>
<p><strong>butterfinger</strong>: But guys, remember, he’s in the castle
at Vinci….</p>
<p><strong>kaplan</strong>: Way to go, Anna.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: When the Mayflowers find out we have the
Codex, they’re going to want to make a deal…</p>
<p><strong>kaplan</strong>: And then we’ll arrest those greedy pigs… Is
that it?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Actually George, it’s not it. What are we
doing in this castle? I happen to know the Mayflowers bought this castle
last year when they found out Da Vinci used to do…</p>
<p><strong>kaplan</strong>: It’s the site of their new museum and we’re
taking it over. Operation Deflower Mayflower is going full speed
ahead.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Oh Lord…. the only reason I ask is that
Hudson, uh, Mr. Hawk, Hawkins, had some “neat” things to say about
Darwin, Minerva, and you. Basically that you’re part of the same car
pool.</p>
<p><strong>kaplan</strong>: Anna. Anna. Anna. If that were true, Almond
Joy would have handed you your heart right after you handed me the
Codex. Now, get some sleep. Kit Kat…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Cat got his tongue?</p>
<p><strong>kaplan</strong>: Actually he never told us what it was.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: How sweet. I trust you will see Hudson Hawk is
given to the proper authorities. I recommend leniency…</p>
<p><strong>snickers</strong>: Oh, I think we all do.</p>
<p><strong>snickers</strong>: Do you think she has any idea that
Operation Deflower Mayflower is as bogus as Kit Kat’s tits?</p>
<p><strong>kaplan</strong>: I don’t think so, although bringing her to
the castle gave her a big, juicy hint.</p>
<p><strong>almond joy</strong>: With all due respect to that great
blouse, why didn’t I cut out her heart?</p>
<p><strong>kaplan</strong>: Close call, but she’s our only way of
keeping tabs on that damn mysterious Vatican organization. Hawk, it’s
time to go to the principal’s office….</p>
<p><strong>darwin</strong>: Seven!</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Jolly. Good. Shot. Sir.</p>
<p><strong>minerva</strong>: Ooh, it’s Hudson Hawk, you cease to amaze
me, convict. You are a terrible cat burglar!</p>
<p><strong>darwin</strong>: Haven’t you ever seen, like David Niven? You
know tiptoe in, tiptoe out.</p>
<p><strong>minerva</strong>: Like a “cat”, one could say.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Shucks, I’ll just take it back.</p>
<p><strong>minerva</strong>: No, let me!</p>
<p><strong>darwin</strong>: I don’t care.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Another piece of the puzzle for the Da Vinci
Alchemy project.</p>
<p><strong>darwin</strong>: Oh, you. There’s nothing more I hate than
failure. All you had to do was follow the Hawk, it’s not like I said
“Teach our nation’s children how to read.”</p>
<p><strong>darwin</strong>: I guess we’re just going to have to kill
’em…</p>
<p><strong>darwin</strong>: God Minerva, I was kidding.</p>
<p><strong>minerva</strong>: Get away from there, convict!</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Just browsing. Don’t touch me….</p>
<p><strong>darwin</strong>: Don’t hurt him! We need him for the final
job!</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Oh weeeeelly, don’t hurt me? Even if I do
this….</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: And this….</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Surely this must offend….</p>
<p><strong>kaplan</strong>: That’s it!</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Things are getting a little loose at the Da
Vinci workshop tonight. “Put your left leg in, take your right foot
out.” May I call you Minnie….</p>
<p><strong>darwin</strong>: Come to think of it there is a part of your
body that you won’t need for your next job…</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Hey, guys, I’ve always wanted to sing like
Franki Valli and the other seasons, but come on….</p>
<p><strong>minerva</strong>: Big girls don’t cry-I-eye.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Two minutes, 35 seconds. Damnit, I’m involved
in this thing, so I just wanna know what this thing is. I wanna be
treated as an adult.</p>
<p><strong>darwin</strong>: That’s fair. Tomorrow. Back in Rome. Now go
to your room.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Forgive me Father for I have sinned. It’s been
1200 hours since my last confession.</p>
<p><strong>cardinal</strong>: Hit me with your best shot.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I betrayed a man. A good man. An innocent man.
A thief.</p>
<p><strong>cardinal</strong>: Anna, what are you trying to say…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: He came into a world where crime is a
legitimate business tactic and a legitimate government procedure. But he
knew Right and Wrong. Oh, and we kind of messed around…</p>
<p><strong>cardinal</strong>: “Messed around” messed around? I know– I
don’t want to know. First base? Second Base? Stop me when I’m getting
warm…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: A little petting is not the issue!</p>
<p><strong>cardinal</strong>: Sorry. Seventeen Hail Marys and five
minutes outside.</p>
<p><strong>cardinal</strong>: So let me get this straight, sister,
you’re saying Hudson Hawk is not willingly working for the Mayflowers
but Kaplan and the Candy Bars are?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You got it. Operation Deflower Mayflower is a
bad joke and I’m the punchline. I thought we were using the CIA to help
us to get Mayflower, but really the CIA was using me to keep us away
from Mayflower.</p>
<p><strong>cardinal</strong>: Oh, why couldn’t I be the Cardinal in
charge of catering…. If the Mayflowers get the three sections of Da
Vinci’s crystal and his instructions for the gold machine– Aie-yi–Do we
got anything? What of Alex, Hawk’s friend, where is his loyalty?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I’m going to find out.</p>
<p><strong>cardinal</strong>: I’m sorry for losing it back there, but
you must remember, sister, you have vows to God as well as a mission to
the world.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I know, I know, your Eminence, just say “God
go with me.”</p>
<p><strong>cardinal</strong>: God go with you, sister.</p>
<p><strong>darwin</strong>: So, Captain Hawk, in one of your paws you
got a gold bar worth about 8 thou. In the autre, you got lead that won’t
get you gelato.</p>
<p><strong>minerva</strong>: Surely a master-thief like you can tell the
difference.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: That’s two down to Kitty Carlisle…</p>
<p><strong>minerva</strong>: Cool, isn’t it? Weight, feel, mal1eability,
they’re all but identical. On the periodic chart of elements, they’re
but one proton apart. Great minds worked for centuries to turn worthless
into priceless.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Alchemy.</p>
<p><strong>darwin</strong>: Alchemy! Is the business term of the 90’s,
my man! Minerva read about it in an airline magazine about four years
ago. I dumped some lira into research… Shazam, we come across a diary by
one of Da Vinci’s apprentices detailing La Machine de Oro, the gold
machine for those at home, and the rest is about to become history.
Money isn’t everything, gold is. Fuck blue chip stocks! Fuck T-bills!
Fuck Junk Bonds! I got the real deal! Money will always be paper but
gold will always be gold!</p>
<p><strong>minerva</strong>: Market crashes. Bomb drops. Greenhouse
effect affects. We’ll still be the richest, most powerful people in the
world. In 1992, Europe is coming together to become one business
superpower. It’s one party we’d love to poop.</p>
<p><strong>darwin</strong>: Well, that said, the last ingredient in the
recipe is in, get this, you’re gonna die, the Kremlin.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Sure. The Kremlin. Makes sense. The Kremlin.
Why not? Listen, this is all too Indiana Jones and the Lost City of King
Tut for me, man. Throw me in jail and go ahead, just try and throw
Alex…</p>
<p><strong>minerva</strong>: Jail, you asshole! Our foot soldiers will
blow your brains out! Bunny, Ball-Ball!</p>
<p><strong>darwin</strong>: I’ll torture you so slowly you’ll think it’s
a career! I’ll kill your family, your friends, and the bitch you took to
the Prom!</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: You want an address on that last one?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Bunny, not you too?</p>
<p><strong>minerva</strong>: You’ve got a dilemma, tiger. I think I know
what’s going to help you solve it.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: I’ll kill all you. Even the old lady.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I hated cigarettes until I saw my first No
Smoking sign. Keep off the Grass? Let’s play Soccer. Only law I cared
about was friendship. Broke that one too, didn’t I? This Gates-Mario
Brothers-CIA-Mayflower-Da Vinci thing seemed like a sweet deal. Visit
foreign lands, take their treasures. I don’t know, I thought you’d get
into it. It’s better than playing darts with M.B.A.’s at the bar. I
didn’t know it was going to be like this. Them using me to use you… I’m
sorry, there’s only one way out of this and it’s gonna hurt me more than
it’s gonna hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>kaplan</strong>: I just don’t think it was a smoking hot idea
to leave them up there alone.</p>
<p><strong>minerva</strong>: Don’t worry George, this is the reason we
put the old diabetic guinea on the payroll to begin with. To keep Hawk
in line. They’ll talk about “being buddies” and “chugging brewskis.”</p>
<p><strong>darwin</strong>: You gotta love male bonding.</p>
<p><strong>kaplan</strong>: You were saying…</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: You bastard! You fucked my freedom for a lousy
job!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Hawk… I’m so sorry…</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: No…..Alex! Wake up, you can’t go out like
this.</p>
<p><strong>minerva</strong>: Plan B, anyone…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Oh thank God, you’re dead…</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: It was so beautiful! When the blanks went off,
they…</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: You bastard. You fucked my freedom for a lousy
job.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: But I said I was sorry….</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: No sweat, Alex, you only made the biggest
mistake of my life. What was your per-diem?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Don’t act like you’ve never committed a crime
before, Hawkins? I know, I made call, when Anna tracked me down I…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Hudson, don’t you understand…</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: And you, Dr. Cappucino, you’re lucky I don’t
hit women, assuming you are a woman. I’m not taking anything for granted
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I-work-for-a-covert-Vatican-humanitarian-
organization. The-CIA-made-a-fool-of-me. I-care-for-you…</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Oh. Well, what’s this?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Where did you get this?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: You know, the place where you gave the bad
guys the Codex…. the Mayflower Museum.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: It’s from the machine. All they need is the
crystal to run it and they have 2/3 of it already. We can’t let that
happen.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: You’re saying you want us to beat them to the
crystal and save the world from financial disarray.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Something like that.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Well, forget about it. Hawk and I are going to
Rio. We’re hurt, we’re tired, and a hero ain’t nothing but a sandwich.
Right, buddy?…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Hudson, God’s given you a gift for cat
burglary, you can t just…</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: You better believe I can. I’m sick of people
telling me what I have to do.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: It’s that kind of selfish attitude that…</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Selfish attitude? I’m just some guy who wants
a little nap and a cappuccino for when he wakes up, not too much
foam…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You re not “some guy” anymore, Hudson. Right
now, you’re the only guy. Without your help, I….</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: The world is beautiful. Every day in prison I
made sure to remember that. It’s only when I actually got out that I
forgot. If I was sane, I’d be on that plane to Rio. But being beaten and
abused to fulfill some corporation’s perverted vision does something to
your mental health. The world is beautiful and I’m tired of being
fucked. It’s Darwin and Minerva’s turn to bite the pillow…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: That was beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I laughed, I cried.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Rio, Alex? After all they’ve done to…Hey,
these tickets are for Moscow!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Damn travel agency. That Kremlin thing is in
Moscow, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Ketchup. Stupido Americani…</p>
<p><strong>kaplan</strong>: We’re all family now. My team has done a lot
of rougher things than steal the model of a helicopter.</p>
<p><strong>snickers</strong>: We’re going to whack this place so fast
we’ll have time to shop for American imports.</p>
<p><strong>almond joy</strong>: Lucky for us, the Da Vinci is located in
a wing of the Kremlin that they used to throw the Miss Ukraine pageant
and stuff. It’ll have the least number of guards….</p>
<p><strong>kaplan</strong>: As for our plan of action, anybody’d be
insane to go in from the ground floor…</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: We’re going in from the ground floor.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Geez, this Art Treasures Room looks like a
burnt diaphragm.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Hey, don’t take your disguise so
seriously.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Uh, yeah. Guess I’m a wee bit nervous. I’m
sorry I could only score clergy passports.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Fits my new image. A thief for the masses.
This is one job I’m not going to feel guilty about enjoying. Gum.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: The security’s actually not that severe.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: It doesn’t have to be. Everybody knows that if
you mess with the Kremlin, you’ll end up in a Siberian gulag eating your
own fingernails.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Shwoof, that makes me feel better. I can’t
believe this is the Iron Curtain. All the guy at Airport customs wanted
to know was “Who Shot J.R.?”</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: You sound disappointed.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Yeah, I mean, come on, going through the Iron
Curtain is supposed to be crawling underneath barbed wire, it’s supposed
to be strangling a guard…</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: It’s supposed to be parachuting in the
moonlight….</p>
<p><strong>snickers</strong>: We are the blue light. The green light is
where the Art Treasures room is.</p>
<p><strong>kaplan</strong>: Let’s go make a purple light. Where’s Kit
Kat?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Delivery Entrance. Low Security.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Gum.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Count of three?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Why not just go now?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>kaplan</strong>: Everything’s going fine, Minerva, thanks for
asking…</p>
<p><strong>minerva</strong>: I say who needs this Hudson Hawk
anyway….</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Oh-Eee-Oh-A-Whoa-Oh.</p>
<p><strong>minerva</strong>: Everybody here, in Rome, wishes you tinsel
boxes of love…</p>
<p><strong>kaplan</strong>: Lazy, rich, condescending bitch.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Eighth room down, babe…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Guards come exactly every three minutes….</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Three. Oh. Oh. “Side by Side.”</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: “Oh, we ain’t got a barrel of money.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: “Maybe we’re ragged and funny.”</p>
<p><strong>hawk and alex</strong>: “But we’ll travel along, singing a
song. Side by Side…”</p>
<p><strong>kaplan</strong>: Create a diversion.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Now that’s a lock.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Don’t worry, we’ll get it…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Can I sing this time, too? Please?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Uh, I guess so.</p>
<p><strong>darwin</strong>: I look at you Soviet people and I feel…
pity… superiority. Most of your life, your government has told you that
Capitalism turns people into robots who’d rather eat microwave sushi,
naked in the back of a Cadillac than hear the laughter of children.</p>
<p><strong>minerva</strong>: We’re here to say, your government was
right.</p>
<p><strong>darwin</strong>: So let’s get busy. Have some fun and make
some deals.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: “Oh this lock is a pain in the bu-utt”</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: “How’d we ever get such in a ru-utt”</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: “But we’ll travel the road, Sharing the load.
Side by Side!”</p>
<p><strong>snickers</strong>: This is the room above the Art Treasures
room. The lock is a Natalya Z-Z, first created…</p>
<p><strong>almond joy</strong>: Snickers, baby, I love you like a
brother, but really, who cares? Silencer bomb…</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: That was close….</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Anna, I think you better stay….</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: You can be lookout!….. Take Alex’s gun.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: “You can be the lookout.”</p>
<p><strong>soviet leader</strong>: Before we serve you “the main
course,” hee, hee, we need to know specifics about what you can do for
us. We–</p>
<p><strong>darwin</strong>: Bluntness. How amusingly Hungarian. Listen
up, for reasons I don’t want to get into, I recently had to close down a
petroleum factory, but I’m going to re-build it here and Madonna’s going
to cut the ribbon! Frozen burritos in Leningrad. 1982 fantasy. 1992
reality.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: “We all had our quarrels and parted…”</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: “But we’ll be the same as we started…</p>
<p><strong>hawk and alex</strong>: “Just traveling along, singing a
song. Side–”</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Geez, this place is a mess…</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Voila…</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Side by side, man…</p>
<p><strong>almond joy</strong>: What the hell….</p>
<p><strong>snickers</strong>: You’re supposed to be dead!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I’m a ghost. Boo.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: I don’t want to sound immature, but we were
here first…</p>
<p><strong>kaplan</strong>: I wish I could think of those cute quips the
way you can, Hawk, but I can’t, so I’ll just shoot Alex.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: No….</p>
<p><strong>almond joy</strong>: That was pretty uncool, George…</p>
<p><strong>kaplan</strong>: Sorry, you know he kind of reminds me of
Little Eddie. But I digress. Ah, victory is so sweet….</p>
<p><strong>minerva</strong>: Yum. This is the best meal I ever had…</p>
<p><strong>kaplan</strong>: Damnit, this isn’t the plan! Blue light,
green light, shit! Snickers, Kit Kat, A.J., scramble, see if you can
find out anything.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Can’t you see the Mayflowers double-crossed
you…</p>
<p><strong>kaplan</strong>: They may be scum, but if I get the Da Vinci
model back, then we’ll be roasting weenies on the beach.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: I don’t think you’ll appreciate their choice
of weenie.</p>
<p><strong>darwin</strong>: You’re helping us achieve a goal and in
return, I’m giving you a key to the world’s executive washroom. Don’t
piss it away…. Skoal, amigos…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Stop or I’ll shoot.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You people are immoral and narcissitic and I
won’t let you…</p>
<p><strong>kaplan</strong>: I can’t believe this. I’m in fucking Russia,
or do I have to say, the fucking Soviet Union and I’m shooting a
non-Bolshevick. I never thought I’d say “I’m just in this job for the
money.” Sad. Any last immature quips?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: No. But why do you let Butterfinger keep those
blood stains on his shirt?</p>
<p><strong>butterfinger</strong>: What blood stains….</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: You want immature, how ’bout an egg fight…</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Alex, are you….</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I can’t believe you didn’t notice. My weight.
I lost ten pounds in Rome</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: You’re a reed, man. I gotta get Anna. Hang in
there…</p>
<p><strong>almond joy</strong>: Anna-bannana-fo-fanna, I guess I have to
cut out your heart for real now. It’s not personal.</p>
<p><strong>almond joy</strong>: You won’t shoot. I read your dossier…
Sister.</p>
<p><strong>almond joy</strong>: I gotta get a new job…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: The Mayflowers got…</p>
<p><strong>darwin</strong>: What a pleasant surprise. You’re probably
wondering…</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: But you’re going to tell us anyway…</p>
<p><strong>minerva</strong>: I hate a man with a sense of humor. While
you corn dogs were comparing the lengths of your masculinity, we
obtained the helicopter the new fashioned way: a thoroughly corrupt
business deal.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: If you think you’re getting past me…</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Don’t be stupid…they…</p>
<p><strong>snickers</strong>: Bastard! If you were a true American.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Just shut up and hit me!</p>
<p><strong>darwin</strong>: Alfred, the getaway car…</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Damnit, I hate this! I’m a cat burglar! Nobody
said anything about this fight-to-the-death shit.</p>
<p><strong>snickers</strong>: Too bad.</p>
<p><strong>minerva</strong>: I knew it! I told you it was a fake.</p>
<p><strong>darwin</strong>: That New-York-Italian-Father-
made-twenty-bucks-a-week-son- of-a-bitch. What was our bet? A
million?</p>
<p><strong>minerva</strong>: Million five, lover…</p>
<p><strong>snickers</strong>: Help me you Democratic Reform lovers! Get
a screwdriver, you Stupid Eskimoes! Screw-dri-ver! Oh God, I always
wanted to know how to play the harp, there just was so little time!
Rosebud!</p>
<p><strong>snickers</strong>: Maybe it was just a….</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Get ’em. They went down the hallway.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Let’s just forget it, I mean…</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Get em….</p>
<p><strong>minerva</strong>: Alex. How’s it going?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Go, go to Hell, to Hell.</p>
<p><strong>minerva</strong>: Where’s your insulin….No? Well, Bon
Appetite.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Oh, come on….</p>
<p><strong>minerva</strong>: Very good, Alex, but you re still
alive….</p>
<p><strong>minerva</strong>: That’s fair.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Why does this have to be so hard…</p>
<p><strong>kaplan</strong>: Tell me about it…</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Take this to Hell with you…</p>
<p><strong>kaplan</strong>: My pension…..</p>
<p><strong>darwin</strong>: God-damnit, I only wanted to destroy the
world in my own image. I’m a regular Joe…</p>
<p><strong>darwin</strong>: Not Lenin, anybody but Lenin. God, let’s
talk abut this.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Wow, this is really gonna hurt the resale
value…</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Oh, honey….</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: We did it man, we…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Oh Hudson…</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: I told you not to call me Hudson. The only
people who called me that were the nuns at…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Oh Hudson, I’m a sister of the Catholic church
as well as an agent.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: This is too bad to be false.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Welcome back to Vinci.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Last rites, sister?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Please, no nun jokes…They’re a bad habit to
get into….get it?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: She killed Alex.</p>
<p><strong>minerva</strong>: Sorry, I couldn’t resist. You’re probably
wondering why you’re still alive. Anna…..</p>
<p><strong>minerva</strong>: I want you to monitor the Da Vinci’s
directions from the apprentice diary. And Hawk, I didn’t want you to go
to hell without knowing that Darwin and I’s dream came true. Beside
that, none of us can seem to put that damn crystal together. Alfie and I
were up all night with the thing.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: You killed a friend. Why should I help you go
for the gold?</p>
<p><strong>minerva</strong>: It’ll take a couple of years of steady
production, but I’ll flood the market with so much gold that gold
itself, the foundation of all finance, will lose its meaning. Brokers,
economists, and fellow entrepreneurs will drown in the saliva of their
own nervous breakdowns. Markets will crash- crash. Financial Empires
will crumble-crumble.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Except yours-yours. The goal of world
domination. Well, if you put it that way, Minnie. How can I resist?</p>
<p><strong>minerva</strong>: You can’t, convict! You’re just a shmoe!
Every shmoe has the fantasy the planet revolves around them. It rains,
car crash stops traffic, you say “How could this happen to me?” It’s a
natural inclination. But for I, this isn’t a fantasy, it is reality! You
are on my planet! You walk around the corner for coffee, out of my
sight, you do not fucking exist! The lives of shmoes like you have
meaning only in relation to the rich, to the powerful, to ME!</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Do it. There’s no reason to fight anymore.
She’s a force of nature.</p>
<p><strong>minerva</strong>: If you pull this off, I can’t promise I
won’t kill you. I mean, who we trying to kid? But I will spare the
Flying Nun here….</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: And to think I thought you were Evil Incarnate
in pumps.</p>
<p><strong>minerva</strong>: I killed some lovable working class
Italian-diabetic, but you killed the most significant male figure of the
decade and a kind, gentle lover. So don’t play with me.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Okay, fine!</p>
<p><strong>minerva</strong>: Oh Hawk, don’t ever change. Go, team,
go!</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: I hope you know what….</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Trust Leonardo….</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Wha…..</p>
<p><strong>minerva</strong>: We’re for real.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Da Vinci made the real directions in a secret
script that I decoded. The way the machine is running now, the gold will
produce too quickly, clog, and the machine will shut itself down. Isn’t
it wonderful?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Yeah, but what would happen if that little
mirror came out of the crystal.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Wha – you don’t want to know…</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: I wanna know…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Holy sh-h–things are going to get very
interesting, very fast. Da Vinci would be proud of you.</p>
<p><strong>minerva</strong>: Eureka, motherfuckers!</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Me, Anna, and Leonardo just wanna say you got
the Midas touch, baby…</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: How.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: You’re unemployed, Alfie. Boss is dead. Her
plan is over.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: My plan is just beginning. I’ll forgive you
for denying me the pleasure of slaughtering my boorish employers, but
I’m afraid the birth of the new British Empire can have no
witnesses!</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Ooh-kay…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Sorry!</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Stop helping me! Thou shalt not kill!</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Don’t lose your head over this.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Excuse my crass American humor.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Allow me.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Oh Bunny, Ball-Ball.</p>
<p><strong>juggler</strong>: Che pazzo….</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Have I ever told you the world is beautiful…
I’d really like to play Nintendo with you, or something…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Hudson, I’m afraid I’m sticking with God. But
you’re a close second, tough guy. What is that smile?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: I got my planet back.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: The first one’s for Alex. Cheers.</p>
