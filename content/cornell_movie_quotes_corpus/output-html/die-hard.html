<p><strong>second revised draft</strong>: October 2, 1987</p>
<p><strong>salesman’s voice</strong>: You don’t like flying, do you?</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: No, no, where’d you get that idea?</p>
<p><strong>salesman</strong>: Ya wanna know the secret of successful air
travel? After you get where you’re going, ya take off your shoes and
socks. Then ya walk around on the rug barefoot and make fists with your
toes.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Fists with your toes.</p>
<p><strong>salesman</strong>: Maybe it’s not a fist when it’s your
toes…I mean like this…work out that time zone tension. Better’n a cup of
coffee and a hot shower for the old jet lag. I know it sounds crazy.
Trust me. I’ve been doing it for nine years.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: It’s okay. I’m a cop. Trust me. I’ve been
doing it for eleven.</p>
<p><strong>stewardess</strong>: Maybe you should have bought her a
ticket.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Her?</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: She doesn’t complain.</p>
<p><strong>stewardess</strong>: Neither would I.</p>
<p><strong>takagi</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen…I congratulate each and
every one of you for making this one of the greatest days in the history
of the Nakatomi corporation…</p>
<p><strong>ellis</strong>: What about dinner?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Harry, it’s Christmas Eve. Families…
Stockings…chestnuts…Rudolph and Frosty…those things ring a bell?</p>
<p><strong>ellis</strong>: I was thinking more of roaring
fireplaces…mulled wine and a nice brie…</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Ginny, it’s 6:40, you’re making me feel like
Ebeneezer Scrooge. Go on, join the party, have some champagne.</p>
<p><strong>ginny</strong>: Thanks Ms. Gennaro. Do you think the baby can
handle a little sip?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Ginny, that baby’s ready to tend bar.</p>
<p><strong>ellis</strong>: How about tomorrow night?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: McClane residence. Lucy McClane speaking.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Hello, Lucy McClane. This is your mother.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Mommy! When are you coming home?!</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Soon. You’ll be in bed when I get there,
though.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Will you come say ‘good night’?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Don’t I always, you goose? Now put Paulina on
the line, and no searching the house for presents!</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: I didn’t look in the front closet under the
steps! Is Daddy coming home with you?</p>
<p><strong>john, jr.</strong>: Yeah! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! And a Captain
Power!</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Well, we’ll see what Santa and Mommy can do.
Goose, put Paulina on, okay?</p>
<p><strong>paulina</strong>: Hello, Mrs. Holly. You coming home
soon?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: I’m working on it. Did Mr. McClane call?</p>
<p><strong>paulina</strong>: No ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Well…maybe there wasn’t time before the
flight. You should probably make up the spare room just in case.</p>
<p><strong>paulina</strong>: Yes, Mrs. Holly. I do that already.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: California.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: I’m John McClane.</p>
<p><strong>argyle</strong>: Argyle. I’m your limo driver. Hey, nice
bag.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Argyle. Don’t you take this stuff?</p>
<p><strong>argyle</strong>: Do I? I’m sorry. You’re gonna have to help
me, man. This is my first time driving a limo.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: That’s okay. This is my first time riding
in one.</p>
<p><strong>argyle</strong>: Just kick back and relax, man. We got
everything you need: CD, CB, TV, VHS, telephone, full bar.</p>
<p><strong>argyle</strong>: If your friend is hot to trot…I know a
couple of mama bears. …Or is he married?</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Married.</p>
<p><strong>argyle</strong>: The girl was off today. Hey, I didn’t expect
you to sit up front. So, your lady live out here?</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: The past six months.</p>
<p><strong>argyle</strong>: Meanwhile, you still live in New York?</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: You’re nosey, you know that, Argyle?</p>
<p><strong>argyle</strong>: Hey, I’m sorry. When I was a cabdriver, see,
people expected a little chit chat, a little eccentricity and
comaraderie, I forgot how stuck up you limo guys were, so excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: It’s okay, it’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>argyle</strong>: So, you divorced of what?</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: She had a good job, it turned into a great
career.</p>
<p><strong>argyle</strong>: But meant her moving here.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Closer to Japan. You’re fast.</p>
<p><strong>argyle</strong>: So, why didn’t you come?</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: ’Cause I’m a New York cop who used to be a
New York kid, and I got six months backlog of New York scumbags I’m
still trying to put behind bars. I don’t just get up and move.</p>
<p><strong>argyle</strong>: You mean you thought she wouldn’t make it
out here and she’d come crawling on back, so why bother to pack?</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Like I said, Argyle…you’re fast.</p>
<p><strong>argyle</strong>: Mind if I play some tunes?</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: How ’bout some Christmas music?</p>
<p><strong>argyle</strong>: That is Christmas music.</p>
<p><strong>10- out out 10-</strong>: 11 11</p>
<p><strong>argyle</strong>: So, you go on upstairs to the party, your
lady sees you, you run into each other’s arms. Music comes up, you live
happily ever after, that it?</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: It’s corny, but I could live with it.</p>
<p><strong>argyle</strong>: What is it don’t work out that way? Where
you gonna stay?</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: I’ll find someplace.</p>
<p><strong>argyle</strong>: Tell you what. I’ll pull into the parking
garage and wait. You score with your wife give me a call on the car
phone and I’ll leave your bags inside at the desk. You strike out… I’ll
get you to a hotel.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: You’re all right, Argyle.</p>
<p><strong>argyle</strong>: Just remember that when you sign for the
tip. They’re paying for it, so don’t be shy.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Holly McClane?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Just type it in there.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Cute toy.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Yeah. When you have to take a leak it’ll help
you find your zipper.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Thirtieth floor…</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Take the express elevator and get off at the
noise.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Lots of hardware…</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: California…</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Excuse me, I’m looking for –</p>
<p><strong>takagi</strong>: Holly Gennero?</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Yeah. How’d you know?</p>
<p><strong>takagi</strong>: I’ve spent half my life on airplanes, I can
recognize someone who just got off one. I’m Joe Takagi, Mr. McClane. I
have …something to do with this company.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: So I’ve heard.</p>
<p><strong>takagi</strong>: Holly went to the Vault room to FAX some
documents…she should be back any…</p>
<p><strong>ellis</strong>: Ah…hi…I just had to make a quick call, and
this was the nearest phone…</p>
<p><strong>takagi</strong>: Ellis, this is John McClane… Holly’s
policeman? Ellis is in charge of International Acquisitions.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: That explains the recent deal with
Bolivia.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Relax, Ellis. I’m off duty.</p>
<p><strong>takagi</strong>: Can I get you anything? Food? Cake? Watered
down champagne punch?</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: I’m fine. You throw quite a party. I didn’t
know they had Christmas in Japan.</p>
<p><strong>takagi</strong>: Hey, we’re flexible. Pearl Harbor didn’t
work out, we got you with tape decks.</p>
<p><strong>ellis</strong>: Actually, it’s kind of a double celebration.
We closed a pretty big deal today and a lot of it was due to Holly.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: All set, Joe. The contracts went over the
wire, and – John…!</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: I was hoping you made that flight.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I was hoping you were hoping that.</p>
<p><strong>takagi</strong>: You wife’s made for this business. She know
how to drive a hard bargain.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Yeah. I remember our first date.</p>
<p><strong>ellis</strong>: Show him the watch.</p>
<p><strong>ellis</strong>: Go on, show him. What’re you, embarrassed? A
little token of our appreciation for all her work.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Nice, but one of us is three hours out of
sync. I think it’s me. Is there a place I can wash up?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Sure. Follow me.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Son-of-a-bitch. It works.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: It’s a long story. You know, I think that
Ellis has his eye on you.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: That’s okay… … I have an eye on his private
bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: So, where are you staying? This all happened
so fast I didn’t even ask you on the phone.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Well, Cappy Roberts retired out here a
couple years ago. He said I could bunk with him.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Oh…Where does he live?</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Ramona…no, Pomona, that’s it.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Pomona! You’ll be in the car the whole
time…Look, let’s make this easy. I have a spare bedroom. It’s not huge,
but the kids would love to have you at the house.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: They would, huh?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: I would too.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: …I’ve missed you.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Especially my name. You must miss it every
time you write a check. When did you start calling yourself
‘Ms. Gennero’?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: This is a Japanese company, you know? They
figure a married woman, she’s on the way out the door…</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Sure. It’s unnerving. I remember this one
particular married woman, she went out the door so fast there was
practically a jetwash…I mean, talk about your wind chill factor…</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Didn’t we have this same conversation in
July? Damn it, John, there was an opportunity out here – I had to take
it –</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: No matter what it did to our marriage –
?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: My job and my title and my salary did nothing
to our marriage except change your idea of what it should be.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Oh, here it comes. One of those ‘meaningful
relationship conversations.’ I never should’ve let you get those
magazine subscriptions –</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: You want to know my idea of a marriage? It’s
a partnership where people help each other over the rough spots –
console each other when there’s a down…and when there’s an up, well,
hell, a little Goddamn applause or an attaboy wouldn’t be too bad. I
needed that, John. I deserved that.</p>
<p><strong>ginny</strong>: Miz Gennero? Mr. Takagi is looking for you…he
wants you to say something to the troops…</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Thanks, Ginny. I’ll be a second. Oh, this is
–</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Hi. John Gennero here. I’m the sensitive
and supportive man of the eighties.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: I’ll be a few minutes. Wait here –</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Don’t I always?</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Schmuck!</p>
<p><strong>22- out out 22-</strong>: 23 23</p>
<p><strong>man #1</strong>: …So, Kareem rebounds – listen, this is a
great play – feeds Worthy on the break, over to A.C., to Magic, back to
Worthy in the lane and –</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: Boom…two points.</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: We’re in.</p>
<p><strong>32- out out 32-</strong>: 35 35</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Argyle…?</p>
<p><strong>argyle</strong>: Hey, John, what’s the word on you and your
lady?</p>
<p><strong>mcclane’s voice</strong>: The vote’s not in yet.</p>
<p><strong>argyle’s voice</strong>: ‘Vote’s not in yet?’ What’s that
supposed to mean.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: What do you want, ‘All My Children’? We’re
making progress. After I get my foot out of my mouth, we’ll really be
cooking, and then I can –</p>
<p><strong>argyle</strong>: What?…Mr. Mac, you there?</p>
<p><strong>argyle</strong>: Well, call me back, John. You got the
number.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Shit…</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Think…</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen, due to the Nakatomi
Corporation’s legacy of greed around the globe, it is about to be taught
a lesson on real power. You…will be witnesses. If our demands are not
met, however – – You may become participants instead. Now, where
is…‘Takagi’? Where is the man who… …used to be in charge here?</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: Mr. Takagi. How do you do. My name is Hans
Gruber.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: 32 construction…33 computers…</p>
<p><strong>57- out out 57-</strong>: 58 58</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: Nice suit. John Philips…London?</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: I have two myself. I’m told Arafat shops there
too…</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: And when Alexander saw the breadth of his
domain, he wept. For there were no more worlds to conquer. The benefits
of a classical education.</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: It’s beautiful. I always enjoyed models as a
boy. The exactness, the attention to every foreseeable detail…
perfection.</p>
<p><strong>takagi</strong>: This is what this is about? Out building
project in Indonesia? Contrary to what you people think, we’re going to
develop that region… not ‘exploit’ it.</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: I believe you. I read the article in
Forbes.</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: Mr. Takagi, we could discuss industrialization
of men’s fashions all day, but I’m afraid my associate, Mr. Theo, has
some questions for you. Sort of fill-in-the blanks questions
actually…</p>
<p><strong>takagi</strong>: I don’t have that code…! You broke in here
to access out computer?!? Any information you could get – they wake up
in Tokyo in the morning, they’ll change it! You won’t be able to
blackmail our executives or threaten –</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: Mr. Takagi…I’m not interested in your
computer. I’m interested in the 640 million dollars in negotiable bearer
bonds you have in you vault.</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: Yes…I know about them. The code key is a
necessary step in accessing the vault.</p>
<p><strong>takagi</strong>: You want…money? What kind of terrorists are
you?</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: Who said we were terrorists?</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: The code key, please…?</p>
<p><strong>takagi</strong>: It’s useless to you! There’s seven
safeguards on our vault, and the code key is only one of them! You’ll
never get it open!</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: Then there’s no reason not to tell it to
us.</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: I told you…</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: It’s not over…</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: This is too nice a suit to ruin, Mr. Takagi.
I’m going to count to three. There will not be a four. Give me the
code.</p>
<p><strong>takagi</strong>: I don’t know it! get on a Goddamn jet to
Tokyo and ask the chairman! I’m telling you! You’re just going to have
to kill me –</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: We do it the hard way! Tony, see if you can
dispose of that. Karl, you’d better check Heinrich’s work up on the
machine floor.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Nothing…</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: See to Heinrich… Now…you can break the code
key…?</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: You didn’t bring me along for my charming
personality.</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: ’Though you could have…</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Argyle. Tell me you heard the shot. Tell me
you heard the shot and you’re calling the police right now…</p>
<p><strong>argyle</strong>: I’m working, honey. Working hard. ’Course
I’ll be by later to pick you up, have I ever lies to you? My boss? He
thinks I’m cruising to Palm Springs…</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: How long?</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: Thirty minutes to break the code… Two hours
for the five mechanicals. The seventh lock…that’s out of my hands.</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: If out plan works…the FBI will get rid of it
for us.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Why the fuck didn’t you stop him? Because,
you ignorant sonofabitch, you’d be dead, too. Think…think,
Goddamnit!</p>
<p><strong>911 dispatcher</strong>: Main Wilshire units. Two alarm fire
at Nakatomi Plaza –</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: C’mon, baby…come to Papa. I’m gonna kiss
your Goddamn dalmatian.</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: Call 911, give them the name and badge number
on your uniform and cancel the alarm…then disable the system. Eddie?
What floor did the alarm go off?</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Son of a bitch…</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: The fire has been called off, my friend. No
one is coming to help you. You might as well come out and join the
others. I promise not to hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Freeze, Police…don’t move or name your
beneficiary.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: You won’t hurt me.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Yeah? Why not?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Because you are a policeman. There are rules
for policemen.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Yeah. My Captain keeps telling me the same
thing.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: A million terrorists in the world and I
kill the one with feet smaller than my sister.</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: I wanted this to be professional, efficient,
adult, cooperative. Not a lot to ask. Alas, your Mr. Takagi did not see
it that way… So he won’t be joining us for the rest of his life. We are
prepared to go any way you make us. When we have achieved our aims you
can walk out of here… or be carried out. Decide now, each of you. But
remember that we have planned everything to the last detail. We are
completely in change.</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: Get them over there. Schnell!</p>
<p><strong>fritz</strong>: Perhaps a security guard we overlooked…?</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: Security guard? They’re usually tired and
burned out old policemen growing fat on a pension…This is… something
else.</p>
<p><strong>fritz’s voice</strong>: We have to do something, Hans.</p>
<p><strong>hans’ voice</strong>: Yes…we have to tell Karl his brother is
dead. Tell him to come down.</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: Franco, you and Fritz take the body upstairs
and out of sight. I don’t want the hostages to think too much.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Jesus…</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: I know what you are feeling. But this is not
productive –</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: He was my only brother…my only family! I want
blood for my blood. We search…now.</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: No. Heinrich’s team must finish planting the
detonators…and Theo needs time on the vault. After the police come
they’ll waste hours trying to negotiate…that’s when we search for this
man. Until then…we do not alter the plan.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: And if he alters it…?</p>
<p><strong>ellis</strong>: What’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: They don’t look happy…something’s gone
wrong.</p>
<p><strong>ellis</strong>: The police…?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: John.</p>
<p><strong>ellis</strong>: John? Christ, he could fuck this whole thing
up…what does he think he’s doing?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: How about his job?</p>
<p><strong>ellis</strong>: His ‘job’ is 3000 miles away. Without him,
they might let us go…at least we have a chance…</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Tell that to Mr. Takagi.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Mayday, Mayday! Anyone! Terrorists have
seized and Nakatomi building and are holding 30 or more hostages! I say
again –</p>
<p><strong>mcclane’s voice</strong>: – unknown number of terrorists, six
or more, armed with automatic weapons at Nakatomi, Century City…
Somebody answer me, Goddamnit!</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: The roof. It’s the best place to transmit.</p>
<p><strong>dispatcher</strong>: It’s the same address as that fire
signal –</p>
<p><strong>supervisor</strong>: – the false alarm? I’ll handle it.</p>
<p><strong>supervisor</strong>: Attention, whoever you are. This channel
is reserved for emergency calls only –</p>
<p><strong>mcclane’s voice</strong>: No fucking shit, lady! Do I sound
like I’m ordering a pizza?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: No one kills him but me.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: They’ve already killed one hostage, and
they’re fortifying their positions while we’re bullshitting! Now, send
police backup ASAP!</p>
<p><strong>supervisor’s voice</strong>: Sir, I’ve already told you, this
is a reserved channel. If this is an emergency call, dial 911 on your
telephone. Otherwise I will report you to the police –</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: – fine! Report me! Hey, come down here and
fucking arrest me! Send the police. NOW – !</p>
<p><strong>supervisor</strong>: Ad…have a black-and-white do a
drive-by.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Thought you guys just ate donuts.</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: They’re for my wife. She’s pregnant. If I
knew she was gonna eat a dozen at a shot, I woulda bought stock in the
company.</p>
<p><strong>dispatcher’s voice/radio</strong>: Dispatch to One Adam Ten,
over.</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: One Adam Ten, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>dispatcher’s voice/radio</strong>: Investigate a code two at
Nakatomi Plaza, Century City.</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: Nakatomi Plaza?</p>
<p><strong>dispatch voice</strong>: One Adam Ten, do you copy?</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: Roger, dispatch. I’m on the way.</p>
<p><strong>hans’ voice</strong>: Karl? Franco? Did you catch him?</p>
<p><strong>franco</strong>: No, but he’s in the elevator shaft.</p>
<p><strong>hans’ voice</strong>: Prefect. The elevators are locked off.
He can’t escape. Just shut him in and return to base.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Hans, he killed by brother –</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: Karl, I know you want him, but the police are
probably on their way. Maybe we can convince them it was all a mistake,
but not if they hear gunshots! If you lock him in he’ll be neutralized –
now do it! Karl? Karl!</p>
<p><strong>110- out out 110-</strong>: 117 117</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Whew…for a moment there I was worried.</p>
<p><strong>130- out out 130-</strong>: 133 133-</p>
<p><strong>franco</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>franco</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>franco</strong>: Karl! Police! Come on.</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: You bet your ass I’m gonna proceed.</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: Guard inside. No signs of disturbance …I’m
going up for a closer look.</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: Eddie?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Had a feeling you’d be calling…</p>
<p><strong>hans’ voice</strong>: Let him in.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Evening, officer. What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: We got an emergency call that there was a
problem here.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: All right!</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Where’s the fucking cavalry?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: We already had that false alarm, you ask me,
the Goddamn computers sent you out on another wild goose chase. They
been chasing bugs in that system since they installed it. Oh, shit, come
on, I got fifty bucks on you assholes – !</p>
<p><strong>152-b- out out 152-b</strong>: 153 153</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Come on, come on…who’s in that car, Stevie
Wonder?</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Drop it or you’re a rugstain.</p>
<p><strong>heinrich</strong>: Marco, duck!</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: Screw this.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Next time – don’t hesitate.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Thanks for the advice.</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: Sorry to water your time. Merry
Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Oh, man, please, no –</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: One Adam Ten to 6421. We had a wild goose
chase on that 436. Everything’s okay here. Over. ‘Oh, the weather
outside is frightful, but the…the uh, dum, de dum’s delightful…’</p>
<p><strong>dispatcher’s voice</strong>: Roger, One Adam Ten. We thought
it was a crank call anyway. Clear to code eight.</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: Roger. ‘…let is snow, let it snow, let it
snow –’</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: – Jesus H. Christ! 6421, this is One Adam
Ten –</p>
<p><strong>dispatcher’s voice</strong>: Roger, One Adam Ten, please
repeat.</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: One Adam Ten, under automatic rifle fire at
Nakatomi! Requesting immediate backup and SWAT assistance…</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Welcome to the party, pal.</p>
<p><strong>thornburg</strong>: – of course I can get us a table,
Wolfgang and me, we’re like that. I interviewed him…hold on, babe…</p>
<p><strong>police scanner</strong>: – attention all units. Officer
pinned down by automatic weapon fire at Nakatomi, Century City – request
assistant –</p>
<p><strong>powell’s voice</strong>: – guys, you want to cut through the
red tape? They practically turned this car into Swiss cheese – !</p>
<p><strong>thornburg</strong>: All right…!</p>
<p><strong>thornburg</strong>: Mary, this is Dick. I want a remote truck
and a crew to meet me at the South gate in fifteen minutes… Damn right,
fifteen… Where are we going? For an Emmy!</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Richard? Richard?</p>
<p><strong>ellis</strong>: I never through I’d love to hear that
sound.</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: – all of you, stay at your posts! We knew that
police action was inevitable… …In fact, it’s necessary. So let them
start their feeble efforts; until them, stay calm. We have the hostages,
remember. We are still in charge.</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: I told all of you…I want radio silence until
further –</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Gee, I’m sorry, Hans, nobody gave me the
message. You shoulda put it on the bulletin board. Anyway, I thought you
and Franco and Karl and the other boys might be lonely, now that I waxed
Tony and Marco and their buddy. So I invited some of the guys from my
card game.</p>
<p><strong>franco</strong>: How…how does he know so much about –</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: Ah, how nice of you to call. I assume you are
our mysterious party crasher. You are most troublesome for a…security
guard?</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: BZZZ! Sorry, Hans, wrong guess. Would you
like to go for Double Jeopardy, where the stakes are double and the
scores really change?</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Bad for your health anyway.</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: Who are you, then?</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Just the fly in the ointment, Hans. The
monkey in the wrench, the pain in the ass -</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: Check on all the others…don’t use the radio.
See if he’s lying about Marco and find out if anyone else is
missing.</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: Mr. Mystery Guest. Are you still there?</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: I wouldn’t think of leaving, Hans. Unless
you want to open the front door…?</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: I’m afraid not. But you have me at a loss –
you know my name, but who are you? Just another American who saw too
many movies as a child. Another orphan of a bankrupt culture who thinks
he’s John Wayne…Rambo… Marshal Dillion.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Actually, I was always partial to Roy
Rogers. I really dug those sequined shirts.</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: Do you really think you have a chance against
us, Mr. Cowboy?</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Yipee-yi-yea…mother-fucker.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: He wasn’t lying about Marco: He’s thirty
stories down on the street. The other man is Heinrich, and I found his
body upstairs. And his bag is missing.</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: He had the detonators! Theo? Theo!</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: Yo!</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: We may have some problems. How is your
schedule?</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: Three down, four to go –</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: Then don’t waste time talking to me.</p>
<p><strong>powell’s voice</strong>: This is Sergeant Al Powell of the
Los Angeles Police Department. If the person who radioed for help on
this channel can hear me, acknowledge this transmission…I say again…</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: I read you, Powell. You the guy in the
car?</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: What’s left of him. Can you identify
yourself?</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Maybe later. Just listen fast because this
is a party line and the neighbors are trigger happy. Now here’s the
skinny: There’s thirty or so hostages on the 30th floor, with probably 2
or 3 guards to cover a group that size. The leader here is named Hans,
and besides the pea shooter he ventilated your car with, they got
machine guns and sidearms up the yin yang. On top of that one of ’em had
a big enough chunck of plastic explosive to orbit Kate Smith.</p>
<p><strong>note</strong>: The following dialogue is said OVER
McClane’s.</p>
<p><strong>franco</strong>: We have to find him and shut him up! He’s
telling them everything –</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: The police are irrelevant. We’ve waiting for
the FBI. Until they arrive, we can’t finish out work. Meanwhile, let
this fool waste time for the police. Fritz, go help Uli find the
bag.</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: We must find those detonators.</p>
<p><strong>powell’s voice</strong>: How many are there?</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Figuring there’s at least one to cover the
lobby, a couple with the hostages…I’d say they came in with about a
dozen…but they’re down to nine now, including the skydiver you already
met. These guys are mostly Europeans, judging by their clothing labels,
and they’re well financed and very slick.</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: I’ve seen enough phoney ID’s in my time to
recognize that the ones they’ve got cost a fortune. Add all that up and
I don’t know what the fuck it means, but these are bad ass preps and
they’re here to stay.</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: I hear you… Partner. And LA’s finest are on
it, so light ’em if you got ’em.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: I’m ahead of you…partner.</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: Uh, what do I call you?</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: ‘Roy’.</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: Got it…‘Roy’. Now listen. If you think of
anything else you think we need to know, don’t be shy, okay? In the
meantime I want you to find a safe place and hole-up and let us do our
job. Understand?</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: They’re all yours, Al. Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>174- out out 174-</strong>: 176 176</p>
<p><strong>robinson</strong>: Who’s talking to them?</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: I am, Sir…Sergeant Al Powell.</p>
<p><strong>robinson</strong>: Dwayne Robinson. Well, what have you
learned? What do they want?</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: The terrorists? Don’t know, Sir. We haven’t
heard a peep from them.</p>
<p><strong>robinson</strong>: Then who the hell have you been talking
too?</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: We don’t exactly know, Sir. He won’t give us
him name. He appears to be the man who called in the report…he’s killed
one of the terrorists for sure and claims he capped two others.</p>
<p><strong>robinson</strong>: He claims? Powell, has it occured to you
he could be one of the terrorists, pulling your chain? Or some kind of
nut case who –</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: I don’t think so, Sir. In fact… I think he’s
a cop. Maybe not LAPD, but definitely a badge.</p>
<p><strong>robinson</strong>: How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: A hunch. Things he said. Like, knowing how
to recognize a phony</p>
<p><strong>robinson</strong>: – recognizing phony ID’s? Christ, Powell,
he could be a fucking bartender for all we know!</p>
<p><strong>robinson</strong>: Oh shit…</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: I…have a request.</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: Oh? What idiot put you in charge?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: You did. You murdered by Boss. Now… They’re
looking to me. Personally I’d pass on the jab. I don’t enjoy being this
close to you.</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: Go on.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: We have a pregnant woman out there – – relax,
she’s not due for two weeks, but a marble floor isn’t doing her back any
good. I’d like permission for her to more to one of the offices where
there’s a sofa.</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: No. But I’ll have a sofa brought out to you.
Good enough?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Good enough. And unless you like is messy,
you’d better start taking us in groups to the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: Yes, you’re right. It will be done.</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: Mr. Takagi chose his people well, Mrs…?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Gennero. Miss Gennero.</p>
<p><strong>thornburg</strong>: This is Richard Thornburg, speaking to
you live from Century City… where Los Angeles has joined the sad but
world wide fraternity whose only membership requirement is the awesome
spectre of International Terrorism…</p>
<p><strong>argyle</strong>: What else is new…?</p>
<p><strong>argyle</strong>: Holy shit…</p>
<p><strong>thornburg</strong>: We’re told that the situation began some
two hours ago when an unidentified party of men took over the building
and sealed off all of its entrances and exits…</p>
<p><strong>thornburg</strong>: Since all the telephone lines have been
cut, the only contact with the building had been through the use of CB
communicators which the terrorists brought with them. Strangely enough,
so far the terrorists have not communicated directly with the police…
but an unidentified man has had several conversations which seem to
indicate…</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>robinson</strong>: What’s it look like? We’re going in.</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: Going in…are you out of your mind? There’s
30 hostages in there – for all we know –</p>
<p><strong>robinson</strong>: – all we know? We don’t know shit, Powell.
If there’s hostages why hasn’t anyone asked for ransom? If there’s
terrorists, where’s their goddamn list of demands? All we know is that
someone shot up your car, and it could be the same flake you’ve been
talking to on the radio!</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: What about the body that fell out of the
window – ?</p>
<p><strong>robinson</strong>: Who the hell knows? Maybe he was a
stockbroker who looked at the Dow Jones and opted for early
retirement!</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Chief, we’re ready.</p>
<p><strong>robinson</strong>: I’m coming.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Rivers.</p>
<p><strong>rivers</strong>: Yo.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Begin your reconnoiter.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Powell? Al, you still with me? What’s going
on? Al?</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: I’m here, Roy, but I’m, uh, kind of busy.
Let’s talk later, okay?</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Al, what’s wrong? Did something – – Oh,
God. You’re coming in! That’s it, isn’t it? Christ, Powell, I told you
what you’re dealing with here –</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: I said we’ll talk later, Roy. If you’re what
I think you are you should know when to listen, when to shut up… and
when to pray.</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: They’ll be coming. Get ready. Theo, watch the
screens. Be our eyes and ears. Wait until they’re close.</p>
<p><strong>rivers</strong>: We’re in position.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Go.</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: It was the night before Xmas, and all through
the house, not a creature was stirring, expect for the four assholes
coming in the rear in standard 2 X 2 cover formation.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>robinson</strong>: They’re shooting at them</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: It’s panic fire…they can’t see
anything.</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: They’re shooting at the lights.</p>
<p><strong>robinson</strong>: They’re going after the lights!</p>
<p><strong>robinson</strong>: Call them back.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: No, they’re almost in.</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: Don’t get impatient. Just wound them.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Send in the car!</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: Well, what have we here. The police’ve got
themselves an R.V. James, Alexander, southeast corner.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: I have them</p>
<p><strong>hans’ voice</strong>: Fire.</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: Hit it again.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Hans, you motherfucker, you’ve made your
point. Let them pull back!</p>
<p><strong>hans’ voice</strong>: Thank you Mr. Cowboy, I’ll take it
under advisement. His it again.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Rivers! Rodriguiz!…Report…</p>
<p><strong>rivers</strong>: This is Rivers. We’ve got one dead.
Everybody’s hit. Rodriguiz’s bleeding bad. We’ve got to get the fuck out
of here!</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Rivers, hang on! That’s an order! Hang on,
we’ll get you out.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Geronimo…motherfuckers.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Oh, Jesus…</p>
<p><strong>thornburg</strong>: Unreal. Did you get all that?</p>
<p><strong>cameraman</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>thornburg</strong>: Eat your heart out, Channel Four.</p>
<p><strong>219- out out 219-</strong>: 221 221</p>
<p><strong>franco</strong>: They’re using artillery on us – !</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: You idiot, it’s not the police… …It’s him.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Al! Al, the guys in the car, did they make
it?</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: Safe and sound, thanks to you. What the fuck
was that?</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: The plastique I found. Is the building on
fire?</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: No, but it’s gonna need one hell of a paint
job and a shitload of screen doors. One spotters say you got two with
that blast.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Two? Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>robinson</strong>: Is that him?</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: Yessir.</p>
<p>****: Give me that. Now, listen to me, mister, I don’t know what you
think you’re doing, but demolishing a building doesn’t fall under the
definition of ‘help’! There’s hundreds of people out here and you
covered half of them in pieces of glass –</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Glass, my ass! Who the fuck is this?</p>
<p><strong>robinson</strong>: This is Deputy Chief of Police Dwayne T.
Robinson, and I’m in charge of this situation.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Well, from up here, it looks like you’re in
charge of shit, Dwayne. I haven’t seen such a fucked up operation since
the Bride of Frankenstein. Ask the guys in the armored car if they
minded a little flying glass.</p>
<p><strong>robinson</strong>: Listen asshole – !</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Asshole? I’m not the one who just for butt
fucked on national TV, Dwayne! Now if you’re not part of the solution,
stop being part of the problem! Get off the Goddamn radio and put Al
back on!</p>
<p><strong>argyle</strong>: Tell ’em, Mr. Mac! Tell ’em!</p>
<p><strong>powell’s voice</strong>: Hello, Roy. How’re you feeling?</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Pretty fucking unappreciated.</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: Hey, I love you. So do a lot of the guys. So
hang in there, man. Hang in there.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Thanks…partner.</p>
<p><strong>gail</strong>: …of the Nakatomi building, sources say that
the terrorist leader ‘Hans’ may be this man, Hans Gruber.</p>
<p><strong>gail</strong>: A member of the radical West German Volksfrei
movement. Strangely, the Volksfrei leadership issued a communique an
hour ago stating that Gruber has been expelled from the organization and
is operating on his own.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Obviously, Gail whatever his affiliation,
it’s safe to say that Gruber’s terrorist actions in Los Angeles tonight
are well, terroristic…</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>ellis</strong>: I’m tired of sitting here waiting to see who
gets us killed first… them…or your husband. Hi there.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>ellis</strong>: Hey, I negotiate million dollar deals for
breakfast. I can handle these clowns. I want to talk to Hans. Hans!
Sprickenzie talk?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: – you wouldn’t let me kill him when I had the
chance –</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: If you’d listened to me he would be
neutralized already!</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I don’t want neutral…I want dead –</p>
<p><strong>ellis</strong>: Hope I’m not interrupting…?</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: What does he want?</p>
<p><strong>ellis</strong>: It’s not what I want, it’s what I can give
you. Look, let’s be straight, okay? It’s obvious you’re not some dumb
thug up here to snatch a few purses, am I right?</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: You’re very perceptive.</p>
<p><strong>ellis</strong>: Hey, I read the papers, I watch 60 minutes, I
say to myself, these guys are professionals, they’re motivated, they’re
happening. They want something. Now, personally, I don’t care about your
politics. Maybe you’re pissed at the Camel Jockeys, maybe it’s the
Hebes, Northern Ireland, that’s none of my business. I figure, You’re
here to negotiate, am I right?</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: You’re amazing. You figured this all out
already?</p>
<p><strong>ellis</strong>: Hey, business is business. You use a gun, I
use a fountain pen, what’s the difference? To put it in my terms, you’re
here on a hostile takeover and you grab us for some greenmail but you
didn’t expect a poison pill was gonna be running around the building.
Hans, baby…I’m your white knight.</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: I must have missed 60 Minutes. What are you
saying?</p>
<p><strong>ellis</strong>: The guy upstairs who’s fucking things up? I
can give him to you.</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: Roy! You all right?</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Yeah, just trying to handle some year old
twinkies. Yucck. What do they put in these things?</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: ‘Sugar, enriched flour, partially
hydrogenated vegetable oil, polysorbate 60 and yellow dye #5.’</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: You sound like a man with a couple of
kids.</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: Not yet, the wife in working on our first.
You got any kids back on the ranch?</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Two. And I’d sure like to see them swinging
on the jungle gym with Al junior.</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: It’s a date. You buy the ice cream.</p>
<p><strong>hans’ voice</strong>: Touching, cowboy, touching. Or should I
call you Mister McClane? Mister officer John McClane on the</p>
<p><strong>thorson</strong>: Get on the phone to our New York
affiliate…move, move!</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Sister Teresa in third grade called me
Mr. McClane. My friends call me John Mac. You’re neither…shithead.</p>
<p><strong>hans’ voice</strong>: I have someone who wants to talk to
you. A very special friend who was at the party with you tonight.</p>
<p><strong>ellis’ voice</strong>: Hello, John boy?</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Ellis?</p>
<p><strong>ellis</strong>: John, they’re giving me a few minutes to try
and talk some sense into you. I know you think you’re doing your job,
and I can appreciate that, but you’re just dragging this thing out. None
of us gets out of here until these people can negotiate with the LA
police, and they’re just not gonna start doing that until you stop
messing up the works.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Ellis, what have you told them?</p>
<p><strong>ellis</strong>: I told them we’re old friends and you were my
guest at the party.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Ellis…you shouldn’t be doing this…</p>
<p><strong>ellis</strong>: Tell me about it.</p>
<p><strong>ellis</strong>: All right…John, listen to me… They want you
to tell them where the detonators are. They know people are listening.
They want the detonators of they’re going to kill me.</p>
<p><strong>ellis’ voice</strong>: John, didn’t you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Yeah, I hear you, you fucking moron!</p>
<p><strong>ellis</strong>: John, I think you could get with the program
a little. The police are here now. It’s their problem. Tell these guys
where the detonators are so no one else gets hurt. Hey, I’m putting my
life on the line for you buddy…</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Don’t you think I know that! Put Hans on!
Hans, listen to me, that shithead doesn’t know what kind of scum you
are, but I do –</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: Good. Then you’ll give us what we want and
save your friend’s life. You’re not part of this equation. It’s time to
realize that.</p>
<p><strong>ellis</strong>: What am I, a method actor? Hans, babe, put
away the gun. This is radio, not television…</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: That asshole’s not my friend! I barely know
him! I hate his fucking guts – – Ellis, for Christ’s sake, tell him you
don’t mean shit to me –</p>
<p><strong>ellis</strong>: John, how can you say that, after all these
years–? John? John?</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: Hear that? Talk to me, where are my
detonators. Where are they or shall I shoot another one? Sooner or
later… …I might get to someone you do care about.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Go fuck yourself.</p>
<p><strong>robinson</strong>: Goddamn, didn’t you hear him! He
practically pulled the Goddamned trigger himself – he gave that man to
them –</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: Christ, can’t you read between the lines! He
did everything he could to save him…if he gave himself up they’d both be
dead!</p>
<p><strong>robinson</strong>: Maybe. And maybe they’d at least be
talking to us! Now tell your ‘partner’ to stay out of it, or so help me
if he lives through this I’ll put him behind bars myself!</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: He’s alone, tired, hunted, and hasn’t seen
diddly-squat from us and you think he gives a flying fuck about what
you’re going to do to him? Robinson, wake up and smell the shit you’re
shoveling!</p>
<p><strong>robinson</strong>: Anytime you want to go home,
Sergeant…consider yourself dismissed.</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: No Sir. You couldn’t drag me away.</p>
<p><strong>hans’ voice</strong>: Attention police. Attention police.</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: This is –</p>
<p><strong>robinson</strong>: This is Deputy Chief Robinson. Who is
this?</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: This is Hans Gruber. I assume you realize the
futility of direct action against me. We have no wish for further loss
of life.</p>
<p><strong>robinson</strong>: What do you wish for, Mister Gruber?</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: I have comrades in arms around the world who
are languishing in prison. The American State Department enjoys rattling
its saber to its own ends… now it can rattle it for me.</p>
<p><strong>hans’ voice</strong>: …The following people are to be
released from their captors: In Northern Ireland, the seven members of
the New Provo Front. In Canada, the five imprisoned leaders of Liberte
de Quebec…</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: …in Sri Lanka, the nine members of the Asian
Dawn movement…</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: ‘Asian Dawn Movement?’</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: I read about them in Time magazine. When these
Revolutionary Brothers and Sisters are Free, the hostages in this
building will be taken to the roof and they will accompany us in
helicopters to the Los Angeles International Airport where you will be
given further instructions. You have two hours to comply.</p>
<p><strong>robinson</strong>: Two hours? Are you insane? I can’t
authorize…hello? Hello?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Do you think they’ll even try to do it?</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: Who cares? Theo. Are we on schedule?</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: One more to go…then it’s up to you.</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: And you better be right, because this one’s
going to take a miracle.</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: It’s Christmas, Theo, it’s the time of
miracles. So be of good cheer and call me when you hit the last lock.
Karl…hunt the little shit down and get those detonators.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Franco is checking the explosives, Fritz is
with him.</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: I’ll check the explosives. You just get those
detonators.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Al? Al, you there?</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: I’m here, cowboy.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Speaking of cows, did you ever hear so much
bullshit in your life? Two hours? That doesn’t even make any sense –</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: Don’t tell me, partner. I’m just a desk
jockey who was on the way home when you rang.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: The way you drove that car, I figured you
for the streets.</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: In my youth, partner. In my youth.</p>
<p><strong>gail</strong>: …author of… ‘Hostage/Terrorist,
Terrorist/Hostage, a Study in Duality.’ Dr. Hasseldorf, what can we
expect in the next few hours?</p>
<p><strong>hasseldorf</strong>: Well, Gail, by this time the hostages
and their captors should be entering the early stages of the Helsinki
Syndrome.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: As in Helsinki, Sweden?</p>
<p><strong>hasseldorf</strong>: Uh…Finland. Basically, it’s when the
hostages and the terrorists go through a sort of psychological
transference and projection of dependency…</p>
<p><strong>hasseldorf</strong>: What can only be described as a strange
sort of trust and bond develops…We’ve had situations where hostages have
embraced their captors after their release and in one case even
corresponded with them in prison…</p>
<p><strong>250- out out 250-</strong>: 253 253</p>
<p><strong>robinson</strong>: The…the FBI? Here? Now?</p>
<p><strong>young cop</strong>: Yessir. Right over there.</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: You want a breath mint?</p>
<p><strong>big johnson</strong>: I’m Special Agent Johnson of the FBI.
This is Agent Johnson…no relation.</p>
<p><strong>robinson</strong>: Dwayne Robinson, LAPD. I’m in charge
here.</p>
<p><strong>big johnson</strong>: Not any more.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Lost?</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: –ohGodplease – don’t kill me – don’t kill me –
you’re one of them, I know it –</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Whoa, whoa, easy man. I won’t hurt you. Who
are you? What are you looking for?</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: A way up to the roof…I thought I could signal
for help –</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Forget it. They got a guy up there. You
want to stay alive, keep moving. Hey? You hear me?</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: You…you’re an American?</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Only if New Jersey counts.</p>
<p><strong>robinson</strong>: We’ve got thirty, maybe thirty-five
hostages, probably on the 30th floor… seven, maybe eight terrorists.</p>
<p><strong>little johnson</strong>: Sounds like a standard A-7
scenario.</p>
<p><strong>big johnson</strong>: Thank you. We’ll handle it from here.
When we need to commandeer your men, we’ll try and let you know.</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: Aren’t you forgetting something?</p>
<p><strong>big johnson</strong>: Such as…?</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: John McClane! He’s the man who gave us all
the information we’ve got! He’s the reason you’re facing seven
terrorists instead of twelve.</p>
<p><strong>little johnson</strong>: He’s inside? Who is he?</p>
<p><strong>robinson</strong>: He may be a cop…we’re checking on that
–</p>
<p><strong>big johnson</strong>: One of yours?</p>
<p><strong>robinson</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>big johnson</strong>: If he’s not a terrorist, and he’s not a
hostage…he’s just not part of the equation.</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: T…that’s the same Goddamn thing the
terrorists said!</p>
<p><strong>little johnson</strong>: Really? That’s one good thing. Sound
like we’re dealing with pros.</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: There was a party – celebration – all of a
sudden they were there – shooting – threatening us –</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Relax, man…you smoke?</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: You…you don’t work for Nakatomi… and if you’re
not one of them…</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: I’m a cop from New York.</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: New York…</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: They invited me to the Xmas party. Who
knew?</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Better than being caught with your pants
down, right? John McClane.</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: William Clay. Call me Bill.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Bill, you know how to use a handgun?</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: One weekend I went to a combat ranch… You
know, that game with the, the guns that shoot red paint? Must sound
pretty silly to you…</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Sounds better than nothing.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Time for the real thing.</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: Karl! Franco! I’m on 33. Come quickly. Put
down your gun and give me my detonators.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Hans. Your Hans.</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: Put it down now.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: That was tricky, with the accent. I bet you
do a great Ed Sullivan. Why do you need the detonators, Hans? I already
used the explosives.</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: I’m going to count to three…</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Yeah. Like you did with Takagi.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: You think I’m a shmuch, Hans.</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: You were saying.</p>
<p><strong>266- out out 266-</strong>: 269 269</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: The glass! Shoot the glass!</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: Smile, Karl. We are back in business.</p>
<p><strong>hasseldorf</strong>: …all depends on what we mean by
“Terror.’ If Clauswitz could say ‘War is the last resort of Deplomacy,’
couldn’t we just as well say that terrorism has an equal claim to…</p>
<p><strong>thornburg</strong>: You got something?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Just McClane’s name, badge number, police
record, vital statistics… …And his family’s address right here in
L.A.</p>
<p><strong>ginny</strong>: That one look pissed, Ms. Gennero…</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Thank God. He’s still alive.</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: You better heat up that miracle you were
talking about. We broke through on Number Six, and the Electromagentic
came down like a sledgehammer…</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: Well have a look at what our friends outside
are doing and I’ll be right up.</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: Roy? You still with us?</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Yeah. But all things being equal, I’d
rather be in Philadelphia. By the way, chalk up two more terrorists.</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: They boys’ll be glad. We got a pool going on
you.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Yeah? What’s the odds?</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: You don’t want to know.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Put me down for twenty anyway…I’m good for
it…so, what got you off the street, Al? You liked lousy coffee, or
what?</p>
<p><strong>powell’s voice</strong>: I…realized I couldn’t do what I had
to anymore…at least not out there. I had an…accident.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: They way you drive, I can see why.</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: I…I shot a kid.</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: Eleven years ago. Oh, it was dark… he was
big for his age…damn ray gun he had looked real enough…yeah, I had all
the right excuses…but afterwards… I really couldn’t draw my gun
again.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: I…I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to make a joke
of it.</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: Hey, you couldn’t know.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: I still feel like shit.</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: Then this won’t matter. LAPD’s not calling
the shots anymore.</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: There’s the city engineers…they’re going into
the street circuits…But who are these guys in the suits?</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: That’s the FBI…ordering them to cut the
building’s power. They’re as regular as clockwork…or a time lock…</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: …the circuits that cannot be cut… are cut
automatically in reponse to a terrorist incident…You ask for miracles,
Theo…I give you the FBI…</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: When you’re hot, you’re hot.</p>
<p><strong>guy in manhole</strong>: We’re spliced in down the line.</p>
<p><strong>little johnson</strong>: Do it…now.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Powell? What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: Ask the FBI. They’ve got the terrorist
playbook and they’re running it, step by step.</p>
<p><strong>kristoff</strong>: Damn! It didn’t go!</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: They’re on the building circuit… it’s too
local.</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: Encourage them to be bolder.</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: The only thing left for them is the City Grid…
…They may not do it.</p>
<p><strong>little johnson</strong>: Shit! Cut it again. Go wider.</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: I can’t go wider here… …I’d have to call
downtown have them take down one of the city grids…you’re talking ten
square block –</p>
<p><strong>robinson</strong>: – ten blocks? Are you crazy? It’s
Christmas Eve, thousands of people – the Mayor’ll scream bloody murder
–</p>
<p><strong>big johnson</strong>: We must shut down the building. Go
wider –!</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: I need authorization –</p>
<p><strong>big johnson</strong>: Authorization? How about the United
States Fucking Government? Lose the grid or lose your job!</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: Central. This is Walt, out at Nakatomi. I
want you to shut down grid 212. No shit, it’s my ass. Just shut it down
now.</p>
<p><strong>big johnson</strong>: That should shake’em up. With all the
power shut down, those bastards are probably scared shitless.</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: What do we do now, arrest them for not
paying their electric bill?</p>
<p><strong>little johnson</strong>: We let them sweat awhile. Then, when
they’re expecting helicopters… …We give them helicopters…</p>
<p><strong>big johnson</strong>: Right up the ass. This is Johnson…no
the other one. I want that air support ready to lift off in five
minutes…Damn right fully armed. We’re on our way. Attention in the
building.</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: This is Hans…</p>
<p><strong>big johnson</strong>: This is Agent Johnson of the FBI. The
State Department has arranged for the release of your comrades. The
helicopters you requested are on the way.</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: I hear you, FBI. We’ll be ready.</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: When they touch down and we blow the roof,
they’ll spend a month sifting through the bodies and rubble. By the time
they figure out what went wrong… …we’ll be earning twenty percent like
nice fat Capitalists.</p>
<p><strong>big johnson</strong>: By the time he figures out what hit him
he’ll be in a body bag.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane’s voice</strong>: Powell, listen…</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: I’m here, John.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Look…I’m getting a bad feeling up here…I’d
like you to do something for me. Look up my wife…don’t ask how, you’ll
know by then…and tell her…tell her…I’ve been a jerk. When things panned
out for her, I should’ve been behind her all the way …We had something
great going until I screwed it up…She was the best thing that ever
happened to a bum like me. She’s heard me say I love you a thousand
times, but she never got to hear this…honey…I’m sorry. You get all
that?</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: I got it. But you can tell her yourself.
Just watch your ass and you’ll make it.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: I hope so. But that’s up to the guy
upstairs. Upstairs… …Hans, you bastard…what were you doing?</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: Roy?</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Stand by, Powell. I gotta check something
out.</p>
<p><strong>thornburg</strong>: One minute, that’s all we ask. You could
be denying them their last chance to talk to their parents.</p>
<p><strong>paulina</strong>: I’m sorry…Mrs. Holly says I couldn’t let
strangers into –</p>
<p><strong>thornburg</strong>: Strangers? I’m with KFLW TV, that’s
affiliated with the FCC, and I’m sure you know that’s the United States
government…just like the INS?</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: I was here…he was…</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Oh my God…</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Powell! Powell, listen to me! You’re being
double crossed! The whole roof of this building is –</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: Roy? Hello? Hello? I thought you had
him.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: I did. He said something about a, a double
cross…</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: Tell me about it.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: We’re both professionals. But this is
personal. You…are done.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: They’re coming.</p>
<p><strong>thornburg’s voice from tv</strong>: – I know you’re proud of
your daddy…</p>
<p><strong>thornburg</strong>: …because he’s a very brave policeman. And
your mom has shown just as much courage. But is there something you
would like to say to them if they’re watching?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Come home.</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: Mrs. McClane. How nice to make your
acquaintance.</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: On your feet, everyone! Upstairs, now! You’ll
lock them up there and come right down…</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Better this way, isn’t it? I mean, any
faggot can shoot a gun.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: You should’ve heard your brother scream
when I broke his fucking neck…</p>
<p><strong>big johnson</strong>: Stay low. They’re expecting transports,
not gunships.</p>
<p><strong>little johnson</strong>: What do you figure on breakage?</p>
<p><strong>big johnson</strong>: I figure we take out all the
terrorists, and lose 20 percent of the hostages… 25, tops.</p>
<p><strong>little johnson</strong>: I can live with those numbers.</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: A little bonus for us. A policeman’s wife
might come in handy.</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: McClane! McClane! I have some news for
you…McClane?</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: McClane? Karl? Karl?</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: Hurry.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: After all your posturing, all your
speeches…you’re nothing but a common thief.</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: I’m an exceptional thief, Mrs. McClane. And
now that I’m moving up to kidnapping, you should be more polite.</p>
<p><strong>big johnson</strong>: Just like Saigon, eh, Wally?</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: My kind of town.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Where’s Holly –</p>
<p><strong>ginny</strong>: The took her – after they saw the kids on
television –</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: What? God –</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Listen to me! All of you, get down to the
lower floors – you’re all in danger.</p>
<p><strong>hostage</strong>: What are you, crazy? We’re being rescued!
Those helicopters –</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: – there won’t be shit for those helicopters
to land on, because the whole top of this building is wired with
explosives! Now get below –</p>
<p><strong>second hostage</strong>: But…we’re safe up here –</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Safe, my ass! This ain’t a helipad, it’s a
launching pad!</p>
<p><strong>young fbi</strong>: Flight leader, this is Wing. I think
they’re on to us. One of the terrorists is firing on the hostages.</p>
<p><strong>little johnson</strong>: Roger, Wing. We copy. Swing around.
Give me a clear shot.</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: Schnell, schnell…der zeitz ist kurz…</p>
<p><strong>big johnson</strong>: Bank and we’ll nail him!</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: Blow the roof. Now!</p>
<p><strong>kristoff</strong>: But Karl and Uli are up there –</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: You assholes, I’m on your side – !</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Fuck this…</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Shit…</p>
<p><strong>argyle</strong>: Where’s the camera when you need them?</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: Let’s move.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Hans!</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: John!</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Holly, we have to stop meeting like this.
So that’s what it was. A fucking robbery. So why nuke the building,
Hans?</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: When you steal six hundred dollars, you can
disappear…but when you steal six hundred million, they will find
you…unless you play dead. Which happens to be your next role… drop your
gun, please.</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: Nein, dies ein ist mein. This time John Wayne
does not walk off into the sunset with Grace Kelly.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: That was Gary Cooper, shithead…</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: No more jokes, drop it or she gets it between
the eyes!</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Whoa, Hans, now you’re the cowboy?</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: ‘Yippe-ki-yea, mother fucker’? Now you are
fucked.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Holly, now…!</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: You were right about us Americans. We are
cowboys.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: It’s okay, babe. It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: You got a warranty on this?</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Al? Al, you here – ?</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: Al. Man, you were my rock. I couldn’t have
made it without you.</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: Bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>mcclane</strong>: I’m serious. Hey, this is my wife… Holly
Gennero.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Holly McClane.</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: A pleasure. I guess John doesn’t need me to
give you that message anymore.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Message?</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: You know, about him being such a jerk – and
how he’s really sor – – ee…Uh, I’m sure he’ll fill you in.</p>
<p><strong>robinson</strong>: I want you for debrief, McClane. You’ve
got some things to answer for – Ellis’ murder – property damage –
interfering with police business –</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: You were right. You couldn’t have made it
without me.</p>
<p><strong>thornburg</strong>: Mr. McClane…Mrs. McClane…any comment on
your incredible ordeal? What are your feelings now that it’s all
over?</p>
<p><strong>thornburg</strong>: Did you get that?</p>
<p><strong>argyle</strong>: If this is their idea of Christmas I gotta
be there for New Year’s.</p>
