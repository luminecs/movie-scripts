<p><strong>miles</strong>: …the fuck…</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>worker</strong>: Hi, Miles. Can you move your car,
please?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>worker</strong>: The painters got to put the truck in, and
you didn’t park too good.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Yeah, hold on.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Fuck!</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Yeah, no, I know I said I’d be there by noon,
but there’s been all this work going on at my building, and it’s like a
total nightmare, and I had a bunch of stuff to deal with this morning.
But I’m on my way. I’m out the door right this second. It’s going to be
great. Yeah. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>barista</strong>: Hey, Miles.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Hey, Simon. Triple espresso, please.</p>
<p><strong>barista</strong>: Rough night, huh? For here?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: No, I’m running late. Make it to go. And give
me a New York Times and… …a spinach croissant.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. erganian</strong>: Look what the cat dragged!</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Hi, everybody.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: About time you got here, bud. Mr. Prompt.</p>
<p><strong>mr. erganian</strong>: We were thinking maybe you took the
wrong way and went to Tijuana and they didn’t let you back in.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: I had to bribe them.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Hey, Miles.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Seriously though, the freeway was
unbelievable today. Unbelievable. Bumper to bumper the whole way. People
getting an early start on the weekend, I guess. Granted I got a late
start, but still.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. erganian</strong>: Christine, why don’t you ask Miles
about the cake?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Oh, good idea. Here, Miles, come to the
kitchen with me.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Don’t bother him with that. We got to get
going.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: It’ll just take a second.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. erganian</strong>: Jack tells us you are publishing a
book. Congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>mr. erganian</strong>: Yes, congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Yeah, well, it’s not exactly finalized yet,
but, um, there has been some interest and –</p>
<p><strong>mrs. erganian</strong>: Your friend is modest.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah, Miles, don’t be so modest. Indulge them.
Don’t make me out to be a liar.</p>
<p><strong>mr. erganian</strong>: What subject is your book? Non-
fiction?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: No, it’s a novel. Fiction. Although there’s a
lot from my own life, so I guess technically some of it is non-
fiction.</p>
<p><strong>mr. erganian</strong>: Good, I like non-fiction. There is so
much to know about the world that I think reading a story someone just
invented is kind of a waste of time.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: So which one do you like better?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: I like them both, but if pressed I’d have to
say I prefer the dark.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: See?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Where the fuck were you, man? I was dying in
there. We were supposed to be a hundred miles away by now.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: I can’t help the traffic.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Come on. You’re fucking hungover.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Okay, there was a tasting last night. But I
wanted to get us some stuff for the ride up. Check out the box.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Why did you tell them my book was being
published?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You said you had it all lined up.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: No, I didn’t. What I said was that my agent
had heard there was some interest at Conundrum…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah, Conundrum.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: …and that one of the editors was passing it
up to a senior editor. She was supposed to hear something this week, but
now it’s next week, and… It’s always like this. It’s always a fucking
waiting game. I’ve been through it too many times already.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I don’t know. Senior editor? Sounds like
you’re in to me.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: It’s a long shot, all right? And Conundrum is
just a small specialty press anyway. I’m not getting my hopes up. I’ve
stopped caring. That’s it. I’ve stopped caring.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: But I know it’s going to happen this time. I
can feel it. This is the one. I’m proud of you, man. You’re the smartest
guy I know.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Don’t open that now. It’s warm.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Come on, we’re celebrating. I say we pop
it.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: That’s a 1992 Byron. It’s really rare. Don’t
open it now. I’ve been saving it!</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: For Christ’s Sake, Jack! You just wasted like
half of it!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Shut up. Here’s to a great week.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Yes. Absolutely. Despite your crass behavior,
I’m really glad we’re finally getting this time together.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: You know how long I’ve been begging to take
you on the wine tour. I was beginning to think it was never going to
happen.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Oh, that’s tasty.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: 100% Pinot Noir. Single vineyard. They don’t
even make it anymore.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Pinot Noir? How come it’s white? Doesn’t noir
mean dark?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Jesus. Don’t ask questions like that up in
the wine country. They’ll think you’re a moron.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Just tell me.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Color in the red wines comes from the skins.
This juice is free run, so there’s no skin contact in the fermentation,
ergo no color.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Sure is tasty.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Did you read the latest draft, by the
way?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Oh, yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I liked it a lot. A lot of improvements. It
just seemed overall, I don’t know, tighter, more… congealed or
something.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: How about the new ending? Did you like
that?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Oh yeah. Much better.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: There is no new ending. Page 750 on is
exactly the same.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well, then I guess it must have felt new
because everything leading up to it was so different.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It’s Christine. Hey you.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: You guys having fun?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah. All twenty minutes so far have been a
blast.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Good. That’s good.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: So what’s up?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Just seeing how you’re doing. And, um,
Mom and I were starting to look over the seating charts again, and we’re
wondering if you wanted Tony Levin to sit next to the Feldmans, or
should he be at one of the singles tables?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: So what do you think? With the
Feldmans?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah. The Feldmans.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Really? Because I don’t know, I was
thinking that –</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well, then put him at the singles table.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: The problem with that is that then
there’s one extra –</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Then put him with the Feldmans. Whatever you
and your Mom decide is fine with me.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Don’t dismiss me. I’m trying to include
you in this decision. He’s your friend.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I didn’t dismiss you. I told you what I
thought, but it didn’t seem to matter, so you decide. Besides, this is
supposed to be my time with Miles. I hope you’re not going to call every
five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: I’m not going to call every five minutes,
but this is important.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Honey, I’m just saying you know I need a
little space before the wedding. Isn’t that the point of this? Isn’t
that what we talked about with Dr. Gertler?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Why are you being so defensive?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I don’t know, Christine. Perhaps it’s because
I feel attacked.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: I ask you one simple question, and
suddenly I’m attacking you.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Listen. I’ll call you when we get there, and
we can talk about it then, okay?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Bye.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Bye.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Tony Levin? Why did you fucking invite Tony
Levin?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Whoa, why are we getting off?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: I’ve just got to make one quick stop. Won’t
take a second.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: I thought we could just say a quick hello to
my mother.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Your mother? Jesus, Miles, we were supposed to
be up there hours ago.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: It’s her birthday tomorrow. And I don’t feel
right driving by her house and not stopping in, okay? It’ll just take a
second. She’s right off the freeway.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: How old’s she going to be?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Um… seventy… something.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: That’s a good age.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Wait a second.</p>
<p><strong>miles and jack</strong>: Surprise! Happy Birthday!</p>
<p><strong>phyllis</strong>: My God. Miles. And Jack! What a surprise. I
can’t remember the last time you brought me flowers.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: They’re from both of us.</p>
<p><strong>phyllis</strong>: A famous actor bringing me flowers on my
birthday. Don’t I feel special?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: A famous actor who’s getting married next
week.</p>
<p><strong>phyllis</strong>: Oh, that’s right. Isn’t that nice? I hope
that girls knows how lucky she is, marrying no less than Derek
Summersby.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Jeez, Mrs. Raymond, that was eleven years
ago.</p>
<p><strong>phyllis</strong>: Well, you were wonderful on that show. I
never understood why they had to give you that brain tumor so soon. Why
that didn’t make you the biggest movie star in the world is a sin. It’s
a sin.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah, well, you should be my agent.</p>
<p><strong>phyllis</strong>: If I was, I would sing your praises up and
down the street until they put me in the loony bin. Now Miles, why
didn’t you tell me you were coming and bringing this handsome man? Look
how I’m dressed. I’ve got to run and put my face on.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You look fabulous, Mrs. Raymond.</p>
<p><strong>phyllis</strong>: Oh, stop it. Make yourselves comfortable.
You boys hungry?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Yeah, I’m hungry.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Just a snack. Calm down.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Let me show you something. The secret to
opening champagne is that once the cork is released, you keep pressure
on it so you don’t –</p>
<p>****: Just a second. Guy’s going for $2500.</p>
<p><strong>phyllis</strong>: Ready for my close up!</p>
<p><strong>phyllis</strong>: Oh, champagne! Miles, why don’t you bring
that out onto the lanai? I thought we could eat on the lanai.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Mrs. Raymond, this is delicious. Absolutely
delicious.</p>
<p><strong>phyllis</strong>: They’re just leftovers.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Is it chicken?</p>
<p><strong>phyllis</strong>: I could have made something fancier if a
certain someone had let me know that a certain someone was coming for a
visit with a certain special friend. Could have made a pork roast.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: It was a surprise, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>phyllis</strong>: And I could have already put clean sheets
on the other bed and the fold- out. You are staying. Wendy, Ron and the
twins are picking us up at 11:30 to go to brunch at the Sheraton. They
do a magnificent job there. Wendy is so excited you’re coming.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: You talked to Wendy?</p>
<p><strong>phyllis</strong>: Just now. She’s thrilled. And the kids.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Yeah, well. You know, Jack’s pretty eager to
get up to… you know, but, uh, yeah. We’ll see how it goes.</p>
<p><strong>phyllis</strong>: Well, you boys do what you want. I just
think it would be nice for us to be together as a family on my
birthday.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Uh-huh. I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: …six, seven, eight,… Nine.</p>
<p><strong>phyllis</strong>: And what was that other one you did, the
one where you’re the jogger?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Oh, that was for, uh, wait… That was for Spray
and Wash.</p>
<p><strong>phyllis</strong>: Spray and Wash. That’s the one.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah, I remember the girl who was in it with
me. She was something.</p>
<p><strong>phyllis</strong>: I just remember you jogging. So when’s the
wedding?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: This Saturday, Mom, remember? We told
you.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: And Miles is my best man, Mrs. Raymond. My
main man.</p>
<p><strong>phyllis</strong>: Miles, when are you going to get married
again?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: I just got divorced. Phyllis.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Two years ago, buddy.</p>
<p><strong>phyllis</strong>: You should get back together with Victoria.
She was good for you.</p>
<p><strong>phyllis</strong>: She was good for you. And so beautiful and
intelligent. You knew her, right?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Oh, yeah. Real well. Still do.</p>
<p><strong>phyllis</strong>: I’m worried about you, Miles. Do you need
some money?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Jack. Jack.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: She’ll wake up.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Fuck, man. Too early in the morning for that,
you know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: She’s a kid, Jack. I don’t even look at that
stuff anymore.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: That’s your problem, Miles.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: As if she’d even be attracted to guys like us
in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Speak for yourself. I get chicks looking at me
all the time. All ages.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: It’s not worth it. You pay too big a price.
It’s never free.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You need to get laid.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It’d be the best thing for you. You know what?
I’m going to get you laid this week. That’s going to be my best man gift
to you. I’m not going to give you a pen knife or a gift certificate or
any of that other horseshit.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: I’d rather have a knife.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No. No. You’ve been officially depressed for
like two years now, and you were always a negative guy anyway, even in
college. Now it’s worse – you’re wasting away. Teaching English to
fucking eighth-graders when they should be reading what you wrote. Your
books.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: I’m working on it.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You still seeing that shrink?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: I went on Monday. But I spent most of the
time helping him with his computer.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well, I say fuck therapy and what’s that stuff
you take, Xanax?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: And Lexapro, yes.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well, I say fuck that. You need to get your
joint worked on, that’s what you need.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Jack. This week is not about me. It’s about
you. I’m going to show you a good time. We’re going to drink a lot of
good wine, play some golf, eat some great food, enjoy the scenery and
send you off in style.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: And get your bone smooched.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: You know what? Let’s take the Santa Rosa
turnoff and hit Sanford first.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Whatever’s closest, man. I need a glass.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: These guys make top-notch Pinot and
Chardonnay. One of the best producers in Santa Barbara county. Look how
beautiful this view is. What a day!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I thought you hated Chardonnay.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: I like all varietals. I just don’t generally
like the way they manipulate Chardonnay in California – too much oak and
secondary malolactic fermentation.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Jesus, what a day! Isn’t it gorgeous? And the
ocean’s just right over that ridge. See, the reason this region’s great
for Pinot is that the cold air off the Pacific flows in at night through
these transverse valleys and cools down the berries. Pinot’s a very
thin-skinned grape and doesn’t like heat or humidity.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hey, Miles. I really hope your novel
sells.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Thanks, Jack. So do I. Here we are.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: So what’d you guys finally decide on for the
menu?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I told you. Filet and salmon.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Yeah, but how are they making the salmon?
Poached with a yogurt-dill sauce? Teriyaki? Curry?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I don’t know. Salmon. Don’t you always have
white wine with fish?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Oh, Jesus. Look, at some point we have to
find out because it’s going to make a big difference.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Let me call Christine.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Doesn’t have to be now. Let’s go taste.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I owe her a call anyway.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hey, honey. So we’re up here about to taste
some whites, and we need to know how the caterers are going to make the
salmon.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No, I know, I didn’t forget, but we wound up
at Miles’s mom’s house, and it got really late, and it was hard to call,
so I’m calling you now. I said I was sorry. Yes, I did. You heard me say
I was sorry, right?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Miles heard me say I was sorry.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Give me a break, will you? I just called to
find out about the salmon – for our wedding – to be more involved, like
you said – and all you want to do is get into it about last night and,
okay, I’m sorry. I’m sorry I didn’t call. You’re totally right. I know,
but I’m trying to make this the best wedding I can with the best wine we
can find. Don’t I get any credit for that? Okay. Look, I’ve got to go.
I’m out here in the parking lot, and Miles is waiting for me…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Baked with a butter-lime glaze.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Now we’re talking.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: This is the condemned man?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Here he is. Jack, Chris. Chris, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: How you doing?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You guys want to start with the Vin Gris?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Sounds good.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: This is rose, right?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Good, yeah, it is a rose. Only this one is
rather atypically made from 100% Pinot Noir.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Pinot noir? Not again! You know, not all
Pinots are noir.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Let me show you.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: First take your glass and examine the wine
against the light. You’re looking at color and clarity.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What color is it supposed to be?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Depends on the varietal. Just get a sense of
it. Thick? Thin? Watery? Syrupy? Inky? Amber, whatever…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Huh.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Now tip it. What you’re doing here is
checking for color density as it thins toward the rim. Tells you how old
it is, among other things, usually more important with reds. This is a
very young wine, so it’s going to retain its color pretty solidly. Now
stick your nose in it.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Don’t be shy. Get your nose in there.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: What do you smell?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I don’t know. Wine? Fermented grapes?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: There’s not much there yet, but you can still
find… …a little citrus… maybe some strawberry… passion fruit… and
there’s even a hint of like asparagus… or like a nutty Edam cheese.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Huh. Maybe a little strawberry. Yeah,
strawberry. I’m not so sure about the cheese.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Now set your glass down and get some air into
it.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Oxygenating it opens it up, unlocks the aroma
and the flavors. Very important. Now we smell again.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: That’s what you do with every one.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: When do we get to drink it?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Now.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: How would you rate this one?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Usually they start you on the wines with
learning disabilities, but this one’s pretty damn good. This is the new
one, right, Chris?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Released it about two months ago.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Nice job.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: We like it.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You know, you could work in a wine store.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Yeah, that would be a good move.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Are you chewing gum?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Want some?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Hey Jack, hurry up!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Just a minute!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I thought you said it was close. Now I’m all
pitted out.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: It’s not even a mile.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: We should have driven.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Not with the wine list these people have. We
don’t want to hold back.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You think I’m making a mistake marrying
Christine?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Whoa.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Come on, do you think I’m doing the right
thing? Tell the truth. You’ve been through it.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Well, you waited for good reason, and you
proposed to Christine for some good reason. So I think it’s great. It’s
time. You’ve got to have your eyes open, that’s all. I mean, look at me.
I thought Victoria and I were set for life.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Christine’s dad – he’s been talking about
bringing me into his property business. Showing me the ropes. And that’s
something, considering how long it took him to get over I’m not
Armenian. So I’m thinking about it. But I don’t know, might get a little
incestuous. But Mike does pretty well. A lot of high-end commercial
stuff.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: So you’re going to stop acting?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No way. This would just provide some stability
is what I’m saying. I can always squeeze in an audition or a commercial
here and there, you know, keep myself in the game in case something big
comes along.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: We’re not getting any younger, right? And my
career, well, it’s gotten pretty, you know, frustrating. Even with my
new manager. Maybe it’s time to settle down.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: If that’s what feels right.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It does. Feels right.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Then it’s a good thing.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah. It’s good. Feels good.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Hey, Miles. Long time no see.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Gary.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: When’s that novel of yours coming out? We all
want to read it.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Soon, soon. Say, this is my buddy Jack. He’s
getting married next week.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: My condolences.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: What are you pouring tonight?</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Lot of good stuff. Got the new Bien Nacido.
Want a taste?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Absolutement. They have their own label
that’s just outstanding.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Tight as a nun’s asshole but qood
concentration. Nice fruit.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah. Tight.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Pour us a couple.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Here’s to my last week of freedom.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: It’s going to be great. Here’s to us.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Miles. Check it out.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Oh, yeah. That’s Maya.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You know her?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Sure I know Maya.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You know that chick?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Jack, this is where I eat when I come up
here. It’s practically my office. And sometimes I have a drink with the
employees. Maya’s great. She’s worked here about a year, maybe a year
and a half.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: She is very hot.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: And very nice. And very married. Check out
the rock.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Doesn’t mean shit. When Christine was a
hostess at Sushi Roku, she wore a big engagement ring to keep guys from
hitting on her. Think it worked? Fuck no. How do you think I met
her?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: This gal’s married to I think a Philosophy
professor at UC Santa Barbara.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: So what’s a professor’s wife doing
waitressing? Obviously that’s over.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: You don’t know anything about this woman.
Calm down. Let’s just eat, okay? The duck is excellent and pairs nicely
with the Highliner Pinot.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Hey, Miles. Good to see you.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Maya, how are you?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: I’m doing good, good. You look great. Did you
lose some weight?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Oh, no, actually. Busy night.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Oh yeah, Sunday night. You guys been out
tasting today?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: You know it. This is my friend Jack. Jack,
Maya.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hiya.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Hi. Well, nice to see you guys here. Bye,
Miles.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Jesus, she’s jammin’. And she likes you. What
else do you know about her?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Well, she does know a lot about wine.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Ooooooohh. Now we’re getting somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: And she likes Pinot.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Perfect.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Jack, she’s a fucking waitress in Buellton.
How would that ever work?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Why do you always focus on the negative?
Didn’t you see how friendly she was to you?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: She works for tips!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You’re blind, dude. Blind.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: I also recommend the ostrich. Very lean.
Locally raised.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: I hate Tony Levin.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Highliner, please.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: That’s on us.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Hey, guys.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: You want to join us?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: So how’s that book of yours going, Miles? I
think you were almost done with it last time we talked.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: I finished it.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Good for you.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It’s getting published. That’s what we’re up
here celebrating.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: That’s fantastic. Congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Are you a writer too?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No, I’m an actor.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Oh yeah? What kind of stuff?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: A lot of TV. I was a regular on a couple of
series. And lately I’ve been doing a lot of commercials. National
mostly.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Anything I’d know?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Maybe. Recognize this?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: “Now with low, low 5.8% APR financing.”</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: That’s hilarious. You sound just like one of
those guys.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I am one of those guys.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: You are not.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: He is.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Consult your doctor before using this product.
Side effects may include oily discharge, dizziness, hives, loss of
appetite, difficulty breathing and low blood pressure. If you have
diabetes or a history of kidney trouble… you’re fucked!</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Oh. I needed that. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: So what are you guys up to tonight?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: We’re pretty wiped. Probably go back to the
hotel and crash.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Yeah, I know what you mean. It’s a long drive
up here. Where’re you staying?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: The Windmill.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Windmill.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Well, good to see you, Miles. Jack.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: See you.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: We’ll catch up with you later, okay?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: We’ll probably go back to the hotel and
crash?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: The girl is looking to party, and you tell her
we’re going to go back to our motel room and crash? Jesus, Miles!</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Well, I’m tired. Aren’t you tired?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: The chick digs you. She lit up like a pinball
machine when she heard your novel was getting published.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Now I’ve got another lie to live down.
Thanks, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m trying to get you some action, but you’ve
got to help me out just a little bit.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Didn’t seem to me like that’s what was going
on. You were all over her.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Somebody had to do the talking. And by the
way, I was right. She’s not married.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No rock. When she came to the bar, sans
rock.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Single. Waitress. Getting off work. Looking
for love. A little slap and tickle.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: She probably went home, lit some candles, put
on some relaxing music, took a nice hot bath, and laid down on her bed
with her favorite vibrator.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Have you no shame?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Shut the fuck up!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You need to get your prostate checked.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: So what’re we going to have? Pigs in a
blanket? The “rancher’s special breakfast”? Or maybe just some grease
and fat with a side of lard?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: So what’s the plan today?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: We head north, begin the grape tour up there,
make our way south so the more we drink the closer we get to the
motel.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: What’s your problem?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I am going to get my nut on this trip, Miles.
And you are not going to fuck it up for me with all your depression and
anxiety and neg-head downer shit.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Ooooh, now the cards are on the table.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yes they are. And I’m serious. Do not fuck
with me. I am going to get laid before I settle down on Saturday. Do you
read me?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Sure, big guy. Whatever you say. It’s your
party. I’m sorry I’m in the way and dragging you down. Maybe you’d have
a better time on your own. You take the car. I’ll catch the train
back.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No, see, I want both of us to get crazy. We
should both be cutting loose. I mean, this is our last chance. This is
our week! It should be something we share.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Can I take your order?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: But I am warning you.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Oatmeal, one poached egg, and rye toast.
Dry.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Okay. And you?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Pigs in a blanket. With extra syrup.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: How much skin and stem contact?</p>
<p><strong>pourer</strong>: About four weeks.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Huh. That explains all the tannins. And how
long in oak?</p>
<p><strong>pourer</strong>: About a year.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: French or American?</p>
<p><strong>pourer</strong>: Both.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Good stuff.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah, oak. That’s a good wood.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Nice, huh?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Victoria and I used to like this view. Once
we had a picnic here and drank a ’95 Opus One. With smoked salmon and
artichokes, but we didn’t care.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Miles.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: She has the best palate of any woman I’ve
ever known. She could even differentiate Italian wines.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Miles, I gotta tell you something. Victoria’s
coming to the wedding.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: I know. You told me. I’m okay with it.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah, but that’s not the whole story. She got
remarried.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: She what? When?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: About a month ago. Six weeks.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: To that guy? That guy with the
restaurant…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Miles… MILES…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Jesus Christ, Miles. Get out!</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: I want to go home now.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You’ve been divorced for two years already.
People move on. She has! It’s like you enjoy self-pity. Makes you feel
special or something.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Is she bringing him to the wedding?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: You drop this bombshell on me. Why didn’t you
tell me before?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Because I knew you’d freak out and probably
get so depressed you wouldn’t even come on this trip. But then I figured
here would be the best place to tell you. We’re here to forget about all
that shit. We’re here to party!</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: I’m going to be a fucking pariah. Everyone’s
just going to be holding their breath to see if I’m going to get drunk
and make a scene. Plus Tony fucking Levin?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No, no, no. It’s cool. I talked to Victoria.
She’s cool. Everyone’s cool.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: You’ve all been talking about it? Behind my
back? Talking about it?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hey, hey, hey. No, you don’t!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Miles?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You going to be okay?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Hey, guys. How’s it going?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Excellent. My friend and I are up here doing
the wine tour, and he tells me that you folks make one hell of a
Syrah.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: That’s what people say.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: You gotta excuse him. Yesterday he didn’t
know Pinot Noir from film noir.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m a quick learner.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: I’m trying to teach my friend here some
basics about wine over the next few days before he goes off and –</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: That’s right – I’m here to learn. I never had
that much interest in wine before, but this trip has been very
enlightening. Always like wine, of course, but I don’t know. More of a
beer man, really. Microbreweries.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Well, no better way to learn than
tasting.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Now there’s a girl who knows how to pour.
What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Stephanie.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Nice.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: So what do you think?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Quaffable but far from transcendent.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I like it. Tastes great. Oaky.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Cabernet Franc. This is only the fifth
year we’ve made this varietal. Very few wineries around here do a
straight Cabernet Franc. It’s from our vineyard up in Santa Maria. And
it was a Silver Medal winner at Paso Robles last year.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Well, I’ve come to never expect greatness
from a Cab Franc, and this one’s no exception. Sort of a flabby,
overripe –</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Tastes good to me. You live around here,
Stephanie?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: In Santa Ynez. And I agree with you about
Cab Franc.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Oh yeah? We’re just over in Buellton. Windmill
Inn.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Oh yeah.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You know a gal named Maya? Works at the
Hitching Post?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Sure I know Maya. Real well.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No shit. We just had a drink with her last
night. Miles knows her.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Could we move on to the Syrah, please?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: This is our Estate Syrah…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You’re a bad, bad girl, Stephanie.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: I know. I might need to be spanked.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: A bad girl, Miles. She might need to be
spanked.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Do you know how often these pourers get hit
on?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Get the trunk.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: You have the keys.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: We’re on.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: She called Maya, who’s not working tonight, so
we’re all going out.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: With Maya?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Been divorced for a year now, bud.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Stephanie, holy shit. Chick had it all going
on.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Well, she is cute.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Cute? She’s a fucking hottie. And you almost
tell her I’m getting married. What’s the matter with you? Gotta love it.
Gotta love it.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You know how often these pourers get hit on?
I’m going for a swim. Get the blood flowing. Want to come?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Nah. I want to watch this.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Miles. Hey, Miles. Time to get up.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Fucking chick in the Jacuzzi – goddamn, Miles,
fucking going nuts up here. Whole place is wide open. Assylvania.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: So what should I wear?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I don’t know. Casual but nice. They think
you’re a writer.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Don’t you have any other shoes?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hello? Oh hey, baby, just checking in. Not
much. We’re about to go out for dinner, probably be out pretty late, so
I thought I’d say goodnight now. I know, I love you too. I miss you.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Please just try to be your normal humorous
self, okay? Like who you were before the tailspin. Do you remember that
guy? People love that guy. And don’t forget – your novel is coming out
in the fall.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Oh yeah? How exciting. What’s it called?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Do not sabotage me. If you want to be a
lightweight, that’s your call. But do not sabotage me.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Aye-aye, captain.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: And if they want to drink Merlot, we’re
drinking Merlot.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: If anyone orders Merlot, I’m leaving. I am
not drinking any fucking Merlot!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Okay, okay. Relax, Miles, Jesus. No Merlot.
Did you bring your Xanax?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: And don’t drink too much. I don’t want you
going to the dark side or passing out. Do you hear me? No going to the
dark side.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Okay! Fuck!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: We’re going in.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: How you doin’ tonight, beautiful?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Good. How’re you?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Great. You look great. You both do.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Not so bad yourself.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: What are you drinking?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: A Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Oh yeah? How is it?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Try it.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Nice. Very nice.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Twelve months in oak.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: On a Sauvignon Blanc?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: I know the winemaker. She comes in the
restaurant all the time.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: This is good. Little hints of clove.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: I know. I love that.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: …medallions of pork with a dusting of black
truffles served with a root vegetable foulon and wasabi-whipped
potatoes. And finally a Copper River salmon grilled on an alder wood
plank. And that comes with roasted new potatoes and steamed
watercress.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: And who gets the wine list?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: I guess Miles wants it.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Nope. You ladies choose.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: You choose, Stephanie.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: So what does everyone feel like?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Whatever you girls want. It’s on us tonight.
Sky’s the limit.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: No, we’re paying for the wine.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I don’t think so. We’re celebrating Miles’s
book deal.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Well, in that case…</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: What’s everyone ordering? Then we can
sort out the wine.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Exactement!</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: I’m having the salmon.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: That’s what I’m having.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: I’m thinking about the duck breast.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Me too.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Well, that narrows things down.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Sounds like… Pinot Noir to me.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Pinot!</p>
<p><strong>victoria</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Victoria.</p>
<p><strong>victoria</strong>: Miles?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Victoria! How the hell are you?</p>
<p><strong>victoria</strong>: Fine. What’s, uh, what’s on your mind?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Heard you got remarried! Congratulations.
Didn’t think you had the stomach for another go-round.</p>
<p><strong>victoria</strong>: Oh, Miles. You’re drunk.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Just some local Pinot, you know, then a
little Burgundy. That old Cotes de Beaune!</p>
<p><strong>victoria</strong>: Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: A little place in Los Olivos. New owners.
Cozy ambiance. Excellent food too – you should try it. Thought of you at
the Hitching Post last night.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>victoria</strong>: Miles, don’t call me when you’re
drunk.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: I just wanted you to know I’ve decided not to
go to the wedding, so in case you were dreading some uncomfortable, you
know, run-in or something, well, worry no more. You won’t see me there.
My wedding gift to you and what’s- his-name. What is his name?</p>
<p><strong>victoria</strong>: Ken.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Ken.</p>
<p><strong>victoria</strong>: Miles, I don’t care if you come to the
wedding or not.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Well, I’m not coming, Barbie. So you guys
have fun.</p>
<p><strong>victoria</strong>: I’m going to hang up now, Miles.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: You see, Vicki, I just heard about this
today, you getting married that is, and I was kind of taken aback. Kind
of hard to believe.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: I guess I just thought there was still some
hope for us somewhere down the road and I just, I just –</p>
<p><strong>victoria</strong>: Miles, maybe it is better if you don’t
come to the wedding.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Whatever you say, Vicki. You’re the boss.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Easy, boy. Easy.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Fine. Just slipped. This is my blood.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Excuse us.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Sorry to make you get up again, Miles.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: That’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What the fuck, man? What is up?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Pull yourself together, man.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: I’m fine!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Where were you?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Did you drink and dial?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Why do you always do this? Victoria’s gone,
man. Gone. Poof.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Stop it. You are blowing a great opportunity
here, Miles. Fucking Maya, man. She’s great. She’s cool. She’s funny.
She knows wine. What is this morose come-down bullshit? These girls want
to party. And what was that fucking ten-minute lecture on, what was it,
Vouvrays? I mean, come on!</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Let’s just say I’m uncomfortable with the
whole scenario.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Oh Jesus, Miles.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: And don’t forget all the bad times you had
with Victoria. How small she make you feel. That’s why you had the
affair in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Shut up. Shut your face.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Don’t you see how Maya’s looking at you? You
got her on the hook. Reel her in! Come on, let’s rachet this up a notch.
You know how to to do it. Here. Drink some agua.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Should we get dessert?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: We were thinking. Why don’t we go back to
my place? I’ve got wine, some insane cheeses, music, whatever.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Excellent idea. Waiter!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Let me see that.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Here. One for you, three for me.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: You sure you want to do this?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: We’re here!</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: What happened to you guys?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Couple of wrong turns. Thanks to Magellan,
here.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Hi. Maya’s in the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: She got anything good?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Oh, yeah. Steph’s way into Pinots and Syrahs.
Hey, Steph? You sure we can open anything? Anything we want?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Anything but the Jayer Richebourg!</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: She has a Richebourg? Mon dieu. I have
completely underestimated Stephanie.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Who do you think you’re dealing with here?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: How about this?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Nope. I don’t think we know each other well
enough. I’d say this guy’s more our speed.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: So what gems do you have in your
collection?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Not much of a collection really. I haven’t
had the wallet for that, so I sort of live bottle to bottle. But I’ve
got a couple things I’m saving. I guess the star would be a 1961 Cheval
Blanc.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: You’ve got a ’61 Cheval Blanc that’s just
sitting there? Go get it. Right now. Hurry up…</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Seriously, the ’61s are peaking, aren’t they?
At least that’s what I’ve read.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Yeah, I know.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: It might be too late already. What are you
waiting for?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: I don’t know. Special occasion. With the
right person. It was supposed to be for my tenth wedding
anniversary.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: The day you open a ’61 Cheval Blanc, that’s
the special occasion.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: How long have you been into wine?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: I started to get serious about seven years
ago.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: What was the bottle that did it?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Eighty-eight Sassicaia.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Wow. We gotta give it a moment, but this is
tasty. Really good. How about you?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: I think they overdid it a bit. Too much
alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Yeah, I’d say you’re right on the money.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Is this Stephanie’s kid? Sure is cute.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Yeah, Siena’s a sweetie.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Is she sleeping or…?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: She’s with her grandmother. She’s with Steph’s
mom. She spends a lot of time over there. Steph’s… well, she’s
Stephanie.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: “And now for a low, low 4.8% APR…”</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: You got kids?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Who me? Nah, I’d just fuck them up. That was
the one unpolluted part of my divorce – no kids.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Yeah, same here.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Let’s go in there.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Looks like our friends are hitting it off.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: It’s kind of weird sitting here with you in
Stephanie’s house. All those times you came into the restaurant. It’s
like you’re a real person now. Almost.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Yeah, I know. It’s kind of weird. Out of
context.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Yeah, weird. But great.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Yeah. Definitely.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: So what’s your novel about?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Well, it’s a little difficult to summarize.
It begins as a first-person account of a guy taking care of his father
after a stroke. Kind of based on personal experience, but only
loosely.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: What’s the title?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: “The Day After Yesterday.”</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Oh. You mean… today?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Um… yeah but it’s more…</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: So is it kind of about death and mortality,
or…?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Mrnmm, yeah… but not really. It shifts around
a lot. Like you also start to see everything from the point of view of
the father. And some other stuff happens, some parallel narrative, and
then it evolves – or devolves – into a kind of a Robbe-Grillet mystery –
you know, with no real resolution.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Wow. Anyway, I think it’s amazing you’re
getting it published. Really. I know how hard it is. Just to write it
even.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Yeah. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Like me, I have this stupid paper due on
Friday, and as usual I’m freaked out about it. Just like in high school.
It never changes.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: A paper?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Yeah. I’m working on a masters in
horticulture. Chipping away at it.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Horticulture? Wow. I didn’t know there was a
college here.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: So… you want to work for a winery or
something someday?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: I do have a copy of the manuscript in the
car. It’s not fully proofed, but if you’re okay with a few typos…</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Oh yeah. Who cares? I’m the queen of typos.
Wow, this is really starting to open up. What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: My palate’s kind of shot, but from what I can
tell, I’d dub it pretty damn good.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Can I ask you a personal question?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Why are you so into Pinot? It’s like a thing
with you.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: I don’t know. It’s a hard grape to grow. As
you know. It’s thin-skinned, temperamental, ripens early. It’s not a
survivor like Cabernet that can grow anywhere and thrive even when
neglected. Pinot needs constant care and attention and in fact can only
grow in specific little tucked- away corners of the world. And only the
most patient and nurturing growers can do it really, can tap into
Pinot’s most fragile, delicate qualities. Only when someone has taken
the time to truly understand its potential can Pinot be coaxed into its
fullest expression. And when that happens, its flavors are the most
haunting and brilliant and subtle and thrilling and ancient on the
planet.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: I mean, Cabernets can be powerful and
exalting, but they seem prosaic to me for some reason. By comparison.
How about you?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: What about me?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: I don’t know. Why are you into wine?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: I suppose I got really into wine originally
through my ex-husband. He had a big, kind of show-off cellar. But then I
found out that I have a really sharp palate, and the more I drank, the
more I liked what it made me think about.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Yeah? Like what?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Like what a fraud he was.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: No, but I do like to think about the life of
wine, how it’s a living thing. I like to think about what was going on
the year the grapes were growing, how the sun was shining that summer or
if it rained… what the weather was like. I think about all those people
who tended and picked the grapes, and if it’s an old wine, how many of
them must be dead by now. I love how wine continues to evolve, how every
time I open a bottle it’s going to taste different than if I had opened
it on any other day. Because a bottle of wine is actually alive – it’s
constantly evolving and gaining complexity. That is, until it peaks –
like your ’61 – and begins its steady, inevitable decline. And it tastes
so fucking good.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Bathroom over there?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: You are such a loser. Come on!</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: I was just getting some water. You want some
water?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Nice.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: I should probably get going.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: You know how to get back to the Windmill,
right?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Got it.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: I had a good time tonight, Miles. I really
did.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Good. So did I.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Okay. See you around.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Um… did you still want to read my novel?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Oh, yeah. Sure. Of course.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Wow. Great.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Hope you like it. Feel free to stop reading
at any time. I’ll take no offense.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Goodnight, Miles.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Fucking chick is unbelievable. Un-be-
lieve-able!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Goddamn, Miles, she is nasty. Nasty nasty
nasty.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Well, I’m glad you got it out of your system.
Congratulations. Mission accomplished.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: You didn’t invite Stephanie to come with us,
did you?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Oh, hey, change of plans. Steph’s off today,
so she and I are going on a hike.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: We were supposed to play golf.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You go. In fact, use my clubs. They’re brand
new – gift from Christine’s dad. It’s on me. Oh, say, by the way,
Stephanie and me were thinking we’d all go to the Hitching Post tonight
and sit at one of Maya’s tables, and she’ll bring us some great wines
and then we can all –</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Count me out.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Oooh, I see. Didn’t go so good last night,
huh? That’s a shocker. You mean getting drunk and calling Victoria
didn’t put you in the mood? You dumb fuck. Your divorce pain’s getting
real old real fast, dude.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Later.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Yeah, well, maybe you should check your
messages first.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Oh, boy.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: She’s been leaving messages here too.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: You should call her.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I will. See ya!</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Right now.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Okay! Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’ve got no problem calling her.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Wait outside, will you?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: That was fun last night.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Yeah. Good food. You’ve got quite a wine
collection. Very impressive.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Thanks. Hey, I talked to Maya this
morning. She said she had a good time too. You should call her.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Where’s Jack?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: He had to make a phone call.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: So what are you up to today, Miles?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Just kickin’ back, I guess. I don’t know.
Jack and I were supposed to go golfing.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Huh.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Yeah, I reserved the tee time about a month
ago.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Oops. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: You golf?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Me? No, I think it’s kind of a stupid
game. I mean, at least, I could never get into it. I tried it once.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Huh. Jack loves golf. Crazy about it.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hey Miles. Miles.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Do you have that other condom?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: What’d Christine say?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Lucked out – got voice mail. Everything’s
cool.</p>
<p><strong>synthesized voice</strong>: No new messages.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Not now! Not now!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hey, there you are.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What’re you drinking?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Any good?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Could I get a glass please? Stephanie took me
out into the Pinot fields today. It was awesome. I think I finally got a
handle on the whole process, from the soil to the vine to the – what do
you call it? – selection and harvest. And the whole, you know, big
containers where they mix it. We even ate Pinot grapes right off the
vine. Still a little sour but already showing potential for great
structure. Stephanie really knows her shit, Miles.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Where is Stephanie?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Upstairs. Getting cleaned up.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: What the fuck are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: With this chick.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Does she know about Saturday?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Um… not exactly. But I’ve been honest. I
haven’t told her I’m available. And she knows this trip up here is only
for a few days. Besides…</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Besides what?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well… I don’t know, just… the wedding.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well, I’ve been doing some thinking.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Oh, you’ve been thinking. And?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I may have to put the wedding on hold is
all.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I fully realize that making a change like that
might be tricky for certain people to accept at first, but life is
short, Miles. I’ve got to be sure I’m doing the right thing before
taking such a big step. And not just for my sake. I’m thinking about
Christine’s feelings too. I take marriage very seriously – always have.
That’s why I’ve never done it before. The day I get married, it’s going
to be the real thing.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Being with Stephanie has opened my eyes. She’s
not uptight or controlling. She’s just cool. Things are so easy with
her. Smells different. Tastes different. Fucks different. Fucks like an
animal. I’m telling you, I went deep last night, Miles. Deep.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Deep.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Don’t get all judgmental on me. This is my
deal. It’s my life, and it’s my call.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I was hoping to get some understanding from
you. And I’m not getting it.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Understanding of what?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Like I might be in love with another
woman.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: In love? Twenty-four hours with some
wine-pourer chick and you think you’re in love? And give up
everything?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Look who’s talking. You’ve been there.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Yes I have, and do I look like a happy man?
Was all that drama with Brenda a happy thing for me to do? Huh? Was it?
Is she a part of my life now?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: This is totally different. I’m talking about
avoiding what you’re talking about. That’s the distinction. I have not
made the commitment yet. I am not married. I have not said the words. In
a few days, I might get married, and if I do, then I won’t be doing
stuff like this anymore. Otherwise, what’s the whole point of getting
married?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: And what about Stephanie? She’s a woman –
with a kid. A single mom. What do you think she’s looking for? Huh?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Here’s what I’m thinking. We move up here, you
and me, buy a vineyard. You design your own wine; I’ll handle the
business side. Then you get inspired and write a new novel. As for me,
if an audition comes along, hell, LA’S two hours away. Not even.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: You’re crazy. You’ve gone crazy.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What do you care anyway? You don’t even like
Christine.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: What? Of course I like Christine.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You said she was shallow. Yeah, and a nouveau
riche.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: That was three years ago after that first
party!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Look, Miles, all I know is I’m an actor. All I
have is my instinct. My intuition – that’s all I have. And you’re asking
me to go against it. And that’s just wrong.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Hi, guys. We should probably get
going.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>caryl</strong>: Stephanie’s heard this a thousand times, but
if I’d done what I wanted and I’d bought up in Santa Maria when I had
the chance, I would have made a fortune when they put in that outlet
center and that Home Depot. Your father knew it too, but he was a
fucking chickenshit. Always was.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Listen, I’m going to make sure Steph and Siena
get home safe, and then maybe we’ll hook up with you later, okay?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Sure, whatever. Maybe I’ll catch a movie.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: See you, Miles. You take care.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Bye, Stephanie. Bye, Siena, Caryl.</p>
<p><strong>siena and caryl</strong>: Bye, Miles.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Call me on my cell if you go out.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: And could I get a Barely Leqal?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: NO, um, the new one.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: How’s it hanging, Miles?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: You know me. I love it up here. How about
you?</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Busy night for a Tuesday. We had a busload of
retired folks in on a wine tour. Usually they’re not too rowdy, but
tonight there was something going on. Full moon or something. What can I
get you?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Highliner.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Glass or bottle?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Bottle.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: You got it.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Say, is Maya working?</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Maya? Haven’t seen her. I think she’s off
tonight. Say, where’s your buddy?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Oh, that’s tasty.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: You okay, Miles?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: I’m good.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Come on, dude. Let’s go golfing! I got us in
at Alisal.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: That’s a public course. No Stephanie?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: She’s working. I need a break anyway. She’s
getting a little clingy. This is our day!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Crap.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Did you ever got ahold of Maya yesterday?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: She likes you, man. Stephanie’ll tell you.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Can you give me some room here?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Oh yeah. Sure.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You know, in life you gotta strike when the
iron’s hot.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Thanks, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Don’t whiff it.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Nice shot.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: You’re an asshole.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What about your agent? Hear anything yet?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What do you think’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Could be anything.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Been checking your messages?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Obsessively.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Huh.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: They probably think my book is such a piece
of shit that it’s not even worthy of a response. I guess I’ll just have
to learn how to kiss off three years of my life.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: But you don’t know yet, so your negativity’s a
bit premature, wouldn’t you say?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Or fuck those New York publishers. Publish it
yourself. I’ll chip in. Just get it out there, get it reviewed, get it
in libraries. Let the public decide.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Don’t come over the top. Stay still.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Just trying to be helpful. It’s all about
stillness, Miles. Inner quiet.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! What’s the matter
with you, man? SHUT UP!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Why are you so hostile? I know you’re
frustrated with your life right now, but you can choose not to be so
hostile. Here.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I don’t know. Got it from Stephanie.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Huh. Let me see the label.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What the fuck?</p>
<p><strong>husband #1</strong>: Hurry it up, will you?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Fucker hit into us.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hey, asshole! That’s not cool!</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Throw me his ball.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Nice shot.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Oh, this is going to be fun. This is going to
be fun.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hit into us again, motherfuckers, and I’ll
ass-rape all four of you!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Just don’t give up on Maya. Cool smart chicks
like that –they like persistence.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: I don’t want to talk about it.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: All I know is she’s beautiful. Lots of soul.
Perfect for you. I’m not going to feel good about this trip until you
guys hook up. Don’t you just want to feel that cozy little box grip down
on your Johnson?</p>
<p><strong>golfer</strong>: Hey, you mind keeping it down, buddy?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Is it the money thing?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Is what the money thing?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: With Maya.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Well, yeah, that’s part of it. Woman finds
out how I live, that I’m not a published author, that I’m a liar
essentially, then yeah, any interest is gonna evaporate real quick. If
you don’t have money at my age, you’re not even in the game. You’re just
a pasture animal waiting for the abattoir.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Is an abattoir like a… like a… what is
that?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Slaughterhouse.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Abattoir. Huh. But you are going to get the
good news this week about your book. I know you are. I can feel it.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It’s Steph. Hey, baby. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yesssss.
I mean I would, but let me see. Hey, Miles… Oh fuck it, we’re going.
We’ll be right there. Me too.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: We’re on.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: What’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: We’re going to have some fun. Remember fun?
We’re going to have some of it. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: What exactly are we going to do?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I said okay?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: You have to tell me –</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Hey, Miles, I heard you came by the restaurant
last night looking for me.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Oh, yeah. No. I mean yeah, I stopped by for a
drink. Didn’t see you.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: I had class.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Well, nice to see you now.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: You too.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You ever actually read any of this guy’s
books?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: He wrote a great one on Burgundy, and I used
to get his newsletter, but then there were doubts about whether he does
all his own tasting. Plus a couple of times he declared certain years
vintages of the century, and they turned out to be turkeys. Fucker never
retracted.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Huh.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: You guys should stop by the restaurant for
lunch today.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Great. What’s the latest we can get
there?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: About two-thirty.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Did you hear about this Bordeaux tasting
dinner down in Santa Barbara Saturday night? It’s a little pricey, but
if you wanted to go, I’d be into it. Why don’t you stay through the
weekend?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: No, we’ve got to get back Friday for the
rehearsal dinner.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: What rehearsal dinner?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Who’s getting married?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Were you ever going to say anything?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Of course I was. I mean, just now I could
have made up some story, but I didn’t. I told you the truth.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Maya.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Don’t touch me. Just take me home.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: I’ve told him. I’ve told him over and over,
but he’s out of control.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Do you know what he’s been saying to her?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: He’s an actor, so it can’t be good.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Oh, just that he loves her. That she’s the
only woman who has ever really rocked his world. How he adores Siena.
How he wants to move up here and get a place with the two of them and
commute when he has to.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: I’m sure he believed every word.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Please believe me. I was even on the verge of
telling you last night, but…</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: But you wanted to fuck me first.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Oh, Maya. No.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: You know, I just spent three years trying to
extricate myself from a relationship that turned out to be full of
deception. And I’ve been doing just fine.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: And I haven’t been with anyone since my
divorce. This has been a big deal for me, Maya – hanging out with you,
and last night. I really like you, Maya. And I’m not Jack. I’m just his…
his freshman roommate from San Diego State.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Could I have my paper, please?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yo! Yo! Here’s my boy! Here’s my boy! Who’s
your daddy, boy? Who is yo’ daddy?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Put me down, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: I said put me down. Jack!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m so proud of you! Let me love you!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: So tell me everything. Details. I like
details.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: It’s private.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You’re kidding, right? Tell me what happened,
you fucker, or I’ll tie your dick in a knot.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Let’s leave it alone.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You didn’t get any, did you? You’re a
homo.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Just stop, okay? Make something up, and
that’s what happened. Whatever you want. Write my confession, and I’ll
sign it. Just stop pushing me all the time! I can’t take it! You’re an
infant! This is all a big party for you, but not for me! This is
serious. And you – Just… leave me alone, okay? You’re fucking me up.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Wow. Okay. Calm down. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Did you have trouble performing? Yeah,
that’s…</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Shut up! Shut up, Jack!</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Don’t answer it.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: I’m telling you, don’t.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hello? Oh, hey, honey. How you doing? Uh-huh.
Uh-huh. Christine.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Listen, honey. Let me call you back. Miles and
I are in the middle of something. No, it’s nothing serious – Miles is
just having one of his freak- outs. Yeah. Love you too. I’ll call you
right back.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: This whole week has gone sour. It isn’t
turning out like it was supposed to. I want to go home.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Who’s being selfish now? I’m the one getting
married. I thought this week was supposed to be about me.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: We gotta slow down. I’m so tired. Let’s just
get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I know what you need.</p>
<p><strong>sales associate</strong>: There you go.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Do you like them?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah, they’re great. Sporty. They’re really
sporty.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Are they too sporty?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Feel better?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Oh here, wait a second. I want to run in here
real quick.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I want to get something for Siena.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: How about this one? We didn’t hit this
one.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Yeah, it’s Frass Canyon. It’s a joke.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You ever actually been in there, Miles?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: I don’t have to.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I say we check it out. You never know.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Tastes like the back of a fucking LA
schoolbus. Probably didn’t de-stem, hoping for some semblance of
concentration, crushed it up with leaves and mice, wound up with this
rancid tar and turpentine mouthwash bullshit. Fucking Raid.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I don’t know. Tastes okay to me. Hey, they got
a reserve pinot.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Let me use your phone.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: I can’t take it anymore. I’ve got to call
Evelyn.</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: Evelyn Berman-Silverman’s office.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Hi, it’s Miles.</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: Oh, hi, Miles. Let me see if I can get
her. You’re in luck. I’ll put you through.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Miles.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Hey, Evelyn, it’s your favorite client.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: How’s the trip?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Good, good. Drinking some good wines and
kicking back, you know. So what’s happening? Still no word?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Actually there is word. I spoke to Keith
Kurtzman this morning.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: And… they’re passing. Conundrum’s passing.
He said they really liked it. They really wanted to do it, but they just
couldn’t figure out how to market it. He said it was a tough call.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Huh.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: I’m sorry, Miles. So I don’t know where that
leaves us. I’m not sure how much more mileage I can get out of
continuing to submit it. I think it’s one of those unfortunate cases in
the business right now – a fabulous book with no home. The whole
industry’s gotten gutless. It’s not about the quality of the books. It’s
about the marketing.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Are you there? Miles?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Yeah, I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: I’m sorry, Miles. We did all we could.
You’ve been a real trooper. Tell him I’ll call back.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: So I guess that’s it.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: You’re a wonderful writer, Miles. Don’t be
discouraged.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Just hang in there, and who knows? After you
get something else published, we can revisit this one. And next time we
can try a different title.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Hit me again.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Pour me a full glass. I’ll pay for it.</p>
<p><strong>pourer</strong>: This is a tasting, sir. Not a bar.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Just give me a full goddamn pour.</p>
<p><strong>pourer</strong>: Sir, what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: I told you I need a drink.</p>
<p><strong>pourer</strong>: Then buy a bottle and go outside.</p>
<p><strong>pourer</strong>: Put the glass down.</p>
<p><strong>pourer</strong>: You’re going to have to leave, sir.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It’s all right. His mother just died.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Just write another one. You have lots of
ideas, right?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: No, I’m finished. I’m not a writer. I’m a
middle-school English teacher. I’m going to spend the rest of my life
grading essays and reading the works of others. It’s okay. I like books.
The world doesn’t give a shit what I have to say. I’m unnecessary. I’m
so insignificant, I can’t even kill myself.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What’s that supposed to mean?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: You know – Hemingway, Sexton, Woolf, Plath,
Delmore Schwartz. You can’t kill yourself before you’ve even been
published.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What about that guy who wrote Confederacy of
Dunces? He committed suicide before he got published, and look how
famous he is.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Don’t give up. You’re going to make it.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Half my life is over, and I have nothing to
show for it. I’m a thumbprint on the window of a skyscraper. I’m a
smudge of excrement on a tissue surging out to sea with a million tons
of raw sewage.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: See? Right there. Just what you just said.
That’s beautiful. A thumbprint on a skyscraper. I couldn’t write
that.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Neither could I. I think it’s Bukowski.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Oh, look. There’s Steph!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hey, baby.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Look what I got for our favorite girl.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Stephanie! Stop!</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: You fucking bastard! Lying piece of shit!
You’re getting married on Saturday? What was all that shit you said to
me?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I can explain.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: You said you loved me! You fuck! I hope
you die!</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Fuckface! You too!</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Aren’t you glad you didn’t move up here and
marry her?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Don’t need a lecture. You fucking told Maya,
didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: No, I did not. Must have been Gary at the
Hitching Post. I think we mentioned it to him the first night.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You told him. I’m fucking hurting here.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Keep it elevated.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Hi. It’s Maya. Please leave a message.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: It’s Miles. Listen, I don’t know if you even
care, but I had to call and tell you again how much I enjoyed our time
together and how sorry I am things turned out the way they did. I think
you’re great, Maya – always have. From the first time you waited on me.
And while I’m at it, I guess you should know that my book is not getting
published. I thought this one had a chance, but I was wrong. Again.
Don’t bother reading it – you’ve got better things to do. So you see I’m
not much of a writer. I’m not anything really. The only real talent I
seem to have is for disappointing people and now you know that
firsthand. We’re leaving in the morning, and I want you to know that I
take with me wonderful memories of you. I’m sorry. I’m really sorry.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m going to need an operation. Maybe a couple
of them. They have to wait for it it to heal first. Then they break it
again.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Good thing you have a voice-over career.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Gonna fuck that up too. I should sue her ass.
Only reason I won’t is to protect Christine.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: That’s thoughtful.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I hate this place.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Take a couple of these, and you’ll learn to
love it.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Two for you. And two for me.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: So how did Stephanie know it was Saturday? We
didn’t get into that with Gary.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Huh. Let me think.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You sure you didn’t say anything to Maya?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Sure I’m sure. And just what are you
implying? I’m really pissed off at you about all this, if you want to
know the truth. What’s Maya going to think of me now just for
associating with you? You’re the one who’s sabotaging me, not the other
way around, pal. Not by a longshot.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I don’t know. Just seems fishy.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What’s it look like to you?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Looks like you were in a bad car
accident.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m hungry.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You know what I’m thinking?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m thinking it’s time to settle down. One
woman. One house. You know. It’s time.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Mm. Mm.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: And here’re your Handi-wipes.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Oh, so that’s what those are? For a second
there I thought you guys were promoting safe sex.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: I’ll be right back with more corn
bread.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I bet you that chick is two tons of fun. You
know, the grateful type.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: I don’t know. I wouldn’t know.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Nice technique there… …Cammi.</p>
<p><strong>cammi</strong>: It’s all in the wrist. You know, you look
really familiar. You from around here? Where’d you go to high
school?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No, we’re from San Diego. Why?</p>
<p><strong>cammi</strong>: I don’t know. You just seem really familiar
to me. Never mind. Enjoy your meals.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hang on. Did you ever know a Derek
Sommersby?</p>
<p><strong>cammi</strong>: Doctor Derek Sommersby? You mean from “One
Life to Live”?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You have to imagine him with a bandage and
shorter hair.</p>
<p><strong>cammi</strong>: No. Way. No way!</p>
<p><strong>cammi</strong>: Oh, my God!</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Could you tell me where the bathroom is?</p>
<p><strong>cammi</strong>: Uh, sure, it’s right over there, right past
the buffalo.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: She gets off in an hour, so I think I’m just
going to have a drink and then… make sure she gets home safe.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: You’re joking, right? What are you doing?
Un-fucking- believeable. Can we just go back to the hotel and hang out
and get up early and play nine holes before we head home?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Look, Miles. I know you’re my friend and you
care about me. And I know you disapprove. I respect that. But there are
some things I have to do that you don’t understand. You understand wine
and literature and movies, but you don’t understand my plight. And
that’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Jesus fucking Christ, it’s freezing.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Vicodin. Where’s the Vicodin? My nose.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Fucking chick’s married.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Her husband works a night shift or something,
and he comes home, and I’m on the floor with my cock in his wife’s
ass.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Jesus, Jack. Jesus. And you walked all the
way back from Solvang?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Ran. Twisted my ankle too.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: That’s five clicks, Jackson.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Fucking-a it’s five clicks! At one point I had
to cut through an ostrich farm. Fuckers are mean.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: We gotta go back.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I left my wallet. My credit cards, cash,
fucking ID, everything. We gotta go back.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Big deal. We’ll call right now and cancel
your cards.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You don’t understand. The wedding bands. The
wedding bands are in my wallet.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Okay, so they were in your wallet, and you
left your wallet somewhere. Some bar. Christine’ll understand.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No. She ordered them special. Took her forever
to find them. They’ve got this design on them with dolphins and our
names engraved in Sanskrit. We’ve got to go back. Christine’ll fucking
crucify me.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: No way. No way.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Please, Miles, please.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Forget it. Your wallet was stolen at a bar.
Happens every day.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No, we’ve got to get my wallet! Those rings
are irreplaceable! We’ve got to get them, Miles! I fucked up! I know I
fucked up, okay? I fucked up. You gotta help me. You gotta help me.
Pleeeease!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Oh, God, please… Oh God. I know I’m bad. I
know I did a bad thing. Help me, Miles. Just this one thing, this one
last thing. I can’t lose Christine. I can’t. I’m nothing without her.
Please, Miles, please… uuuuu… uuuuuu…. uuuuuuu……</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: She tell you she was married?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: So what the fuck were you thinking?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Wasn’t supposed to be back till six. Fucker
rolls in at five.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Cutting it a little close, don’t you think?
So how was she? Compared to Stephanie, say.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Horny as shit. Flopping around like a landed
trout.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah, this is the block. Just keep going…
Yeah! This is it. There’s her car.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: So what’s the plan?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: The plan is… you go.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: My ankle. Just go explain the situation.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Uh, excuse me, sir, but my friend was the one
balling your wife a couple hours ago, and he seems to have left his
wallet behind, and we were wondering…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah, yeah. Like that. Just like that.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Fuck you. I’ll get it myself.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Hold on.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: You don’t think I fuck you, bitch? I’ll fuck
you.</p>
<p><strong>cammi</strong>: I’m a bad girl. I’m a bad girl.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: You picked him up and you fucked him, didn’t
you, bitch?</p>
<p><strong>cammi</strong>: I picked him up and I fucked him. I’m a bad
girl.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: And you liked fucking him, didn’t you, you fat
little whore?</p>
<p><strong>cammi</strong>: I liked it when you caught me fucking
him.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: The fuck was that?</p>
<p><strong>cammi</strong>: The wallet! He took Derek’s wallet!</p>
<p><strong>cammi</strong>: Get him!</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Open up! Jesus! Open the goddamn door!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: You motherfuckers! I’ll kill you! I’ll kill you
motherfuckers!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You did it! You fucking did it!</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: Housekeeping.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Hey, Jack. Jack.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hrnrnrn?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: That was quite a day yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yep. Quite a day.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Quite a week.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Want me to drive?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: No, I’m okay.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hey, why don’t you invite Maya to the
wedding?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Somehow I don’t think inviting Maya to your
wedding is the right move. In fact, after your bullshit, it’s going to
be hard for me to even go to the Hitching Post again.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You’re so negative.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Come on, let me drive.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: I’m fine. You rest.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I feel like driving.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Nothing. Buckle up, okay?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: What the fuck!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You said it looked like a car accident.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: What the fuck!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’ll pay for it.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Look at this!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I don’t know. Doesn’t look like anybody got
hurt in this one.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Oh, no. Oh, Christ. No, you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You need a new car anyway.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I said I’d pay for it.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: You broke some.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Whatever. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: No, not whatever. You fucking derelict.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You ready?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Oh, fuck!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It’s okay. I’ve got Triple A.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Well. That about does it.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Why don’t you come in?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Uh-uh. You’re on your own.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: So I’ll see you at the rehearsal.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Love you, man.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Back at you.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hey, don’t pull away till they see the
car.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Yeah. Hey, why wasn’t I injured?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You were wearing your belt.</p>
<p><strong>victoria</strong>: Hey, Miles.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Hi, Vicki. You look beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>victoria</strong>: Thanks. Um, this is Ken Cortland, my
husband.</p>
<p><strong>ken</strong>: How are you?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Hi. How you doing? You’re a lucky guy.</p>
<p><strong>ken</strong>: Thanks. I’ll wait for you at the car. Nice to
meet you, Miles.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Ken.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: That was big of him.</p>
<p><strong>victoria</strong>: Yeah, he’s good that way. Very
considerate.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: That’s great.</p>
<p><strong>victoria</strong>: So how’re you doing?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Since the last time we spoke? I don’t know.
Could be better. Could be worse.</p>
<p><strong>victoria</strong>: So what’s happening with your book?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Universally rejected. Strike three.</p>
<p><strong>victoria</strong>: Oh, Miles. That’s awful. What are you
going to do?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Back to the drawing board, I guess. Or not.
So… you’re married. Congratulations. You look happy.</p>
<p><strong>victoria</strong>: I am.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Seems like everyone’s getting married. A year
ago it was all divorces. Now it’s all weddings. Cyclical, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>victoria</strong>: I guess.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Well, let’s go have some champagne, shall we?
Toast all the newlyweds.</p>
<p><strong>victoria</strong>: Not me. I’m not drinking.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: You quit drinking?</p>
<p><strong>victoria</strong>: I’m pregnant.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Oh. Huh. Well… Congratulations again, Vicki.
That’s wonderful news.</p>
<p><strong>victoria</strong>: See you over there, Miles.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>14-year-old boy</strong>: “The marrow of his bone,” I
repeated aimlessly. This at least penetrated my mind. Phineas had died
from the marrow of his bone flowing down his blood stream to his
heart.</p>
<p><strong>14-year-old boy</strong>: I did not cry then or ever about
Finny. I did not cry even when I stood watching him being lowered into
his family’s straight-laced burial ground outside of Boston. I could not
escape a feeling that this was my own funeral, and you do not cry in
that case.</p>
<p><strong>14-year-old boy</strong>: Do you want me to keep reading the
next chapter, Mr. Raymond?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Hrnrnrn? No, we’ll pick up there on
Monday.</p>
<p><strong>answering machine</strong>: One new message.</p>
<p><strong>maya’s voice</strong>: Hello, Miles. It’s Maya.</p>
<p><strong>maya’s voice</strong>: Thanks for your letter. I would have
called you sooner, but I think I’ve needed some time to think about
everything that happened and what you wrote to me. Another reason I
didn’t call sooner is that I wanted to finish your book, which I finally
did last night.</p>
<p><strong>maya’s voice</strong>: I think it’s really lovely, Miles.
You’re so good with words. Who cares if it’s not getting published?
There are so many beautiful and painful things about it. Did you really
go through all that? It must have been awfully hard. And the sister
character – Jesus, what a wreck. But I have to say I was really confused
by the ending. Did the father finally commit suicide, or what? It’s
driving me crazy. And the title.</p>
<p><strong>maya’s voice</strong>: Anyway, it’s turned cold and rainy
here lately. But I like winter. So listen, if you ever do decide to come
up here again, you should let me know. I would say stop by the Hitching
Post, but to tell you the truth I’m not sure how much longer I’m going
to be working there. I’m going to graduate soon so I’ll probably
relocate. We’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>maya’s voice</strong>: Anyway, like I said, I really loved
your novel. Don’t give up, Miles. Keep writing. You’re really good. Hope
you’re well. Bye.</p>
