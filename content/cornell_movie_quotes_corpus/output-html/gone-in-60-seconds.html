<p><strong>gone in 60 seconds</strong>: by Scott Rosenberg 4/6/99</p>
<p><strong>atley jackson</strong>: You gonna steal her or kneel down to
her and pray – ?</p>
<p><strong>donny</strong>: Problem, Officer?</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Yes. You’re under arrest – ?</p>
<p><strong>donny</strong>: For running a stop sign?</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: For Grand Theft Auto -</p>
<p><strong>hawkings</strong>: Astricky. And Jackson. No sign of
Raines…</p>
<p><strong>detective castlebeck</strong>: Well, then it’s all for
naught, ain’t it, Hawkings?</p>
<p><strong>detective castlebeck</strong>: I know you –</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: You know my back -</p>
<p><strong>detective castlebeck</strong>: You want to come along
quiet?</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: How’s Atley – ?</p>
<p><strong>detective castlebeck</strong>: Leg’s all banged-up. He made a
stupid play … He’ll limp around the yard up at Folsom. But Astricky will
be there to take care of him. With their priors, they’re looking at a
serious bounce –</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Let them go –</p>
<p><strong>detective castlebeck</strong>: How’s that?</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Let them go. And I’ll leave …</p>
<p><strong>detective castlebeck</strong>: You’ll leave – ?</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: You don’t have anything on me. A misdee
auto-theft. I got no record. I’ll be out in three days, and back at it.
Or you let them go, and I give you my word. I’m gone. And without the
ringleader … Your tee-times have just grown exponentially…</p>
<p><strong>detective castlebeck</strong>: I don’t golf…</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: You have my word…</p>
<p><strong>detective castlebeck</strong>: Get out of here, then.
Now.</p>
<p><strong>detective castlebeck</strong>: Leave the car, Randall …</p>
<p><strong>detective castlebeck</strong>: Arright, let lim go. Cite him
for rolling the stop … And cite old Atley for driving to endanger …</p>
<p><strong>hawkings</strong>: What are you talking about, Rollie? We’re
springing ’em? Just like that?</p>
<p><strong>detective castlebeck</strong>: Just like that. Quit your
bellyaching, Hawkings … And let’s wrap this up …</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: You know what you got here?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Not really -</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: There’s excessive resistance in the
cranking circuit … You know what you gotta do – ?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Not really –</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: You have any other answers besides “not
really”?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Not –</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Right. You want to test the voltage drop …
Use the voltmeter … Remove the primary lead from the ignitioncoil and
crank her … See what you got … You understand – ?</p>
<p><strong>budgy</strong>: Just can’t find good help these days –</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Those things’ll kill ya, Budgy –</p>
<p><strong>budgy</strong>: They won’t have a chance. The bourbon and
bacon’ll get me first…</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: 1980 Mercury Cougar. 255 cubic inch V8 …
Based on the Ford Thunderbird bodyshell; they modified the chassis, but
didn’t improve its performance…</p>
<p><strong>budgy</strong>: Damn, you’re good</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: That I did, Budgy. That I did –</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Uh … Randall – ?</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Excuse me –</p>
<p><strong>freb</strong>: The corner of Hawthorne and Granvia. Tumbler
messed up. He said the Lotus would be at the corner of Hawthorne and
Granvia –</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: He didn’t mess up. There it is …</p>
<p><strong>cars</strong>: Porsches and Ferraris, Lamborghinis and
Bertones … And- there it is, a 1996 LOTUS ESPRIT V8, gleaming in the
all-night showroom lights…</p>
<p><strong>freb</strong>: That – ?</p>
<p><strong>mirror man</strong>: You’re shittin’, right? Kip?</p>
<p><strong>freb</strong>: How are we supposed to–</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Pop the trunk. I need my tool …</p>
<p><strong>mirror man</strong>: What tool – ?</p>
<p><strong>mirror man</strong>: Newsflash, Kip: you’re driving a stolen
car</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Yeah. Ain’t it great – ?</p>
<p><strong>atley jackson</strong>: Can you stop that, for Chrissake?</p>
<p><strong>tumbler</strong>: What’s your problem, bro ?</p>
<p><strong>atley jackson</strong>: Where are they – ?</p>
<p><strong>tumbler</strong>: They’ll be here. You nervous, bro? You?
Back in the day, they say you had anti-freeze in them veins … What
happened – ?</p>
<p><strong>mirror man</strong>: Stolen car, Kip. Stolen car, stolen car,
stolen car …</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Stolen fast car…</p>
<p><strong>mirror man</strong>: No way, man –</p>
<p><strong>atley jackson</strong>: Something wrong, Tumbler – ?</p>
<p><strong>tumbler</strong>: Yeah. I’m missing Springer –</p>
<p><strong>atley jackson</strong>: She’ll go 0 to 60 in 4.9 seconds
–</p>
<p><strong>mirror man</strong>: I can vouch for that.</p>
<p><strong>tumbler</strong>: Thirteen down … Thirty-seven to go …</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: No problem -</p>
<p><strong>thuggish man</strong>: Let’s get outta here – !</p>
<p><strong>atley jackson</strong>: Now you gone and done it, Raines And
they flee …</p>
<p><strong>detective drycoff</strong>: They’re gone…</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: What’s going on – ?</p>
<p><strong>atley jackson</strong>: Well, well, well …</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Hello, Atley …</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: How’s the leg?</p>
<p><strong>atley jackson</strong>: Only hurts when I breathe. Lookit
you. Where are Barney Fife and Aunt Bea hanging out? And Opie … Where’s
Opie at?</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>atley jackson</strong>: Is there someplace we can talk?</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: What about?</p>
<p><strong>atley jackson</strong>: About your brother. And the deeeep
shit he’s in –</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: There you go –</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Thanks, Donna –</p>
<p><strong>atley jackson</strong>: It’s been a long time, Memphis –</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Six years …</p>
<p><strong>atley jackson</strong>: Six years. Shit. Time flies, don’t
it? Six years ago we were fartin’ through Armani and pissin’ Cristal.
Now look at us …</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Tell me about Kip -</p>
<p><strong>atley jackson</strong>: He took a job. And he fumbled it. Now
he’s jammed-up. Jammed-up bad…</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: What kind of job… ?</p>
<p><strong>atley jackson</strong>: A boost. A big boost …</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: A boost? What’s Kip doing on a boost?</p>
<p><strong>atley jackson</strong>: You’re shittin’, right?</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: It seems she neglected to mention it</p>
<p><strong>atley jackson</strong>: Maybe she don’t know. Although I
don’t see how that could be. Maybe she didn’t want to upset you -</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Don’t feel the need to explore my family
dynamics, Atley…</p>
<p><strong>atley jackson</strong>: The point is: Kip’s been living the
life. Only he’s a wild child. Crazy. Makes our old behavior seem like
altar boy time. But he fungold this one so bad, folks around L.B. are
already speakin’ about him in the past tense.</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Who was the job for?</p>
<p><strong>atley jackson</strong>: Who do you think?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Can I get some more coffee – ?</p>
<p><strong>helen raines</strong>: Sure, hon …</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Who’s a guy gotta know to get a tuna melt
in this joint – ?</p>
<p><strong>cook</strong>: What’s the word, Memphis – ?</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: How ya doing, Ruby – ?</p>
<p><strong>helen raines</strong>: Come, come, come …</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Right …</p>
<p><strong>helen raines</strong>: You look good…</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: You, too, Ma…</p>
<p><strong>helen raines</strong>: What are you doing back?</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: How’s Kip?</p>
<p><strong>helen raines</strong>: Have you seen him?</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>helen raines</strong>: oh.</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Atley Jackson came to see me …</p>
<p><strong>helen raines</strong>: Atley Jackson. How is that one? How’s
the leg… ?</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Why didn’t you tell me?</p>
<p><strong>helen raines</strong>: I couldn’t. I didn’t want you to
worry. I thought held sort himself out. I hardly see him. He comes and
goes. He’s in trouble, isn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: He’s in some trouble …</p>
<p><strong>helen raines</strong>: I knew it. He’s changed, Randall. He’s
a different boy. He’s lost that… That sweetness … It’s gone … And I
don’t know what to do …</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: You getting my checks … ?</p>
<p><strong>helen raines</strong>: Of course …</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Detective Castlebeck… It’s me … Yeah… You
ain’t never gonna guess who just come in to visit his Ma –</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: He doesn’t return my calls. or my letters
…</p>
<p><strong>helen raines</strong>: Kipling was sixteen when you left,
baby. I don’t know what you remember of him. But you should brace
yourself</p>
<p><strong>tumbler</strong>: … so … It’s my new move … It’s called “The
Stranger.” What I do is, I sit on my hand for 10 minutes. Till it falls
asleep. Till it’s good and numb. No feeling. And then I jerk off.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: That’s disgusting -</p>
<p><strong>freb</strong>: What’s the point, man – ?</p>
<p><strong>tumbler</strong>: Cos it’s like you’re bein’ done by a
stranger … It rocks … It’s the power move of the New Millennium…</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Hey, Kip, what’s up?</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: What do you say, Toby?,</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I’m cool -</p>
<p><strong>tumbler</strong>: What do you want, shithead?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Why you gotta front me like that? I’m talking
to Kip –</p>
<p><strong>tumbler</strong>: Why don’t you leave him alone?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I known Kip longing than you, man …</p>
<p><strong>tumbler</strong>: Oooh, ain’t you the lucky duck –</p>
<p><strong>freb</strong>: Any word, Kip – ?</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: No … And they won’t take my calls …</p>
<p><strong>freb</strong>: What does that mean – ?</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: It ain’t what you’d call a “good sign”</p>
<p><strong>freb</strong>: But we only got till Friday. That’s four days.
And we lost the 13. So’s we gotta start over …</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: That, too … Don’t sweat it, Freb. We’re
cool.</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: It can be done, man. We just gotta step it up…
It’s a challenge …</p>
<p><strong>mirror man</strong>: The challenge is not to get our nuts
cut-off and shoved down our throats …</p>
<p><strong>tumbler</strong>: Can I help you, pal – ?</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Hey, Kip …</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Hello, Memphis –</p>
<p><strong>tumbler</strong>: “Memphis?” You’re Memphis?</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: That’s right…</p>
<p><strong>tumbler</strong>: Damn. Damn, damn, damn …</p>
<p><strong>freb</strong>: Memphis. Holy shit. It’s an honor, man –</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: It’s good to see ya, man. You changed your look
-</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: You, too</p>
<p><strong>freb</strong>: What are you doing back, Memphis?</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Little visit. Check on the family.</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: It’s nice to see ya, man -</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Hey, Memphis. Remember me? Toby Walker. I live
next door …</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Sure. Hey, Toby. You grew up</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Yeah, I’m cool …</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Who’s got next game – ?</p>
<p><strong>mirror man</strong>: I get it. You ain’t gotta be a genius:
Memphis come back to save our bacon!</p>
<p><strong>tumbler</strong>: Shut-up, Mirror Man –</p>
<p><strong>freb</strong>: Izzat true? You come back to save our
bacon?</p>
<p><strong>mirror man</strong>: Of course it’s true. He come to save his
brother’s dangling ass –</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: That can’t be it. Cos we don’t need saving</p>
<p><strong>freb</strong>: We don’t – ?</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: He give you an advance – ?</p>
<p><strong>mirror man</strong>: Hell, yeah. Ten larger man</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: You just give ’im back the money. All’s
well…</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: “Give lim back the money.” “Give ’im back the
money…” Be nice. If only we didn’t drink the money. And smoke the money.
And buy Nikes with the money. And Sony Play Stations with the money. And
dirty girls with the money…</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: But don’t worry, man. Things are all sweetness
and light here…</p>
<p><strong>tumbler</strong>: Things are all leafy and suburban …</p>
<p><strong>mirror man</strong>: The hell they are –</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Sure they are. Although we do appreciate the
gesture, Memphis. But we do got it handled… And it was nice to see you –
-</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: You listen to me, baby brother. You fancy
yourself some reat neat tough guy scumbum, well, woop-tee-doo, little
puppy with a poundcake. But I remember the days when you used to steal
my Colorforms and eat ‘em… So you can’t stop me from saving your
“dangling ass’ if that’s what I feel like doing…</p>
<p><strong>tumbler</strong>: Damn… Homeboy’s on the dazzle …</p>
<p><strong>dog-face</strong>: Yeah – ?</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Randall Raines to see Mr. Calitri …</p>
<p><strong>calitri</strong>: Randall Raines … It’s been a long time …
’though I do I recall you as a man with style. You remember your old
friend, Atley – ?</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: How ya doing?</p>
<p><strong>atley jackson</strong>: Good to see you, Memphis –</p>
<p><strong>calitri</strong>: So. What do we owe the honor – ?</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: It’s about my brother … Kip…</p>
<p><strong>calitri</strong>: Yes … Kip …</p>
<p><strong>calitri</strong>: Excuse me one moment, Randall …</p>
<p><strong>calitri</strong>: You bring this to me in this condition?
Blood and guts all over it? You make me complicit? On my property? Who
taught you how to think? And worst of all: weren’t there supposed to be
two Hondas?</p>
<p><strong>thief</strong>: Please …</p>
<p><strong>calitri</strong>: Stupid sonuvabitch…</p>
<p><strong>atley jackson</strong>: Car-jacker. Neglected to clean up
after himself …</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Jesus …</p>
<p><strong>atley jackson</strong>: The business has changed…</p>
<p><strong>calitri</strong>: Now. Where were we? Oh, yes. Kip.</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: I don’t want him hurt…</p>
<p><strong>calitri</strong>: I’m proud of this work. The bird feeder.
The wagon wheel planter. The dollhouse. The drop-leaf movable
server…</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: I’m sure you’re working your way to the
point. I’ll wait right here …</p>
<p><strong>calitri</strong>: My point. Yes. Simple, really. I require
the best. I insist on the best. I only engage the best. Your brother.
His friends. They came to me. They wanted my paper. He was your brother.
You were the best. Now. They’ve brought so much goddamn heat down, I may
not be able to fill this order. Which would be very bad for me. Which in
turn, is very bad for them…</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: I could kill you. That occurred to me. When
I first heard about this. That I would kill you …</p>
<p><strong>calitri</strong>: Grow up. You don’t kill people like me.
People like me die in their sleep at 87 … Do you know why? Because if
you did kill me, and everyone knew it was you - for the next ten years
they’d be finding pieces of those you love scattered all over California
…</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: I can come up with the front money. Pay you
back…</p>
<p><strong>calitri</strong>: Were it only that easy. I have obligations.
The order needs to be filled…</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: They gave you only four days?</p>
<p><strong>calitri</strong>: They gave me two weeks. I wasted most of it
with your brother and his crew, who not only lost what pitiful few they
managed to boost, but also alerted the heat as to our endeavor, making
this even more difficult to achieve …</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: I’m not interested –</p>
<p><strong>calitri</strong>: I knew you’d say that.</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: I’m just here about my brother.</p>
<p><strong>calitri</strong>: I knew you’d say that, too –</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Sound it out for me.</p>
<p><strong>calitri</strong>: Your brother has four days. Fifty cars.
Five-zero. For that he gets 200 large …</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: And if he doesn’t make it – ?</p>
<p><strong>calitri</strong>: I made this, too. My first one. Brass
extension handles, not plated. The coverings are silk, not rayon.
Expensive hardwood. And lined with spray green Lorraine crepe …</p>
<p><strong>digger</strong>: Evenin’, Mr. C. –</p>
<p><strong>calitri</strong>: Digger, Butz: let me introduce you to
Randall Raines. Used to head up the dandiest ring in Southern Cal. Left
us for parts unknown. Randall, this is Digger. And that’s Butz -</p>
<p><strong>digger</strong>: Hi, Randall –</p>
<p><strong>calitri</strong>: Digger and Butz will be in charge of
burial. They’re good boys …</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: I don’t want them hurt. Any of ’em…</p>
<p><strong>calitri</strong>: “don’t want” the Dodgers to lose or the
summer to end. But we don’t get to choose these things…</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: … the car-jacking, which left Ramona
Sullivan, the 44-year-old mother of three, dead, occurred last night at
…</p>
<p><strong>detective castlebeck</strong>: I know you.</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: You know my back.</p>
<p><strong>detective drycoff</strong>: When’d you get to town,
Raines?</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: The other day….</p>
<p><strong>detective drycoff</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: No particular reason. Catch a Laker game. I
heard we got Shaquille …</p>
<p><strong>detective drycoff</strong>: Where you been, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Just out there. Roaming around. Building up
my collection of refrigerator magnets …</p>
<p><strong>detective drycoff</strong>: You seem a little hinked-up …</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Not at all …</p>
<p><strong>detective castlebeck</strong>: I remember us having made some
kind of deal, Randall. I don’t remember this deal having some kind of
time-limit. I look at you - here - in my town - and I’m confused…</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: A little family emergency –</p>
<p><strong>detective castlebeck</strong>: I hope it’s not your dear
sweet mother…</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>detective castlebeck</strong>: Or your baby brother. What was
his name?</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Kip.</p>
<p><strong>detective castlebeck</strong>: Yes, Kip. Short for Kipling.
Named for the English writer of stories about India … He bites into his
pear … Memphis says nothing, waits …</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: And this has what to do with me?</p>
<p><strong>detective castlebeck</strong>: I don’t know. But you
shouldn’t be here. Take care of your business. I’ll give you 24 hours.
And then I don’t want to see your face. Ever again. Make a fool of me
once, that’s my bad. Make a fool of me twice. That’s really my bad, and
I’ll kick your ass from here to India …</p>
<p><strong>detective castlebeck</strong>: Good. Cos you know how it
plays. Six years ago, I let you go free. But the next time … The next
time sends you away for’a long, long while …</p>
<p><strong>detective drycoff</strong>: By the time you get out, asshole,
there won’t even be cars. We’ll all be cruisin’ around in space ships
…</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: You goin’ home?</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Yeah… You want a ride…</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Sure -</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: How’d you get here? Your Moms give you ride –
?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Hell, no. I boosted a ’Vette.</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: You boosted a ’Vette? Then where is it?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I dunno. It was right here. Someone musta’
boosted it back…</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Damn crooks is everywhere –</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Yeah. Except the only thing he’s growing is
old…</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Don’t you do that! You leave him alone!</p>
<p><strong>goon</strong>: Shaddup, Raines</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: He’s got nothing to do with this –</p>
<p><strong>goon</strong>: Get him in the car</p>
<p><strong>calitri</strong>: Hello, Kip –</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Lemme out of this –</p>
<p><strong>calitri</strong>: Were it only that easy –</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: We can still do it –</p>
<p><strong>calitri</strong>: No you can’t. Flies on sherbert is what you
remind me of. Because just being attracted to something, doesn’t mean
you belong…</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Listen, Calitri –</p>
<p><strong>calitri</strong>: Call me “Ray.” Better yet: call me
“asshole.” Cos that’s how you’ve treated me –</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: I get out of this I’m gonna fuck you up –</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Kip – ?</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Yeah …</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: You all right – ?</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: I think so. There’s things I can’t feel right
now. Like my feet. But … You think you can get me outta this, Memphis?
I’d appreciate it -</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Just hold-on there –</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: This has nothing to do with any of that –</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Oh. You maybe have more than one enemy who
owns a car-crusher – ?</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: All my enemies own car crushers. It’s like a
pre-requisite … Owwww…</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Easy … Take it easy … We’re almost
there…</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: You okay – ?</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Totally. I’m fine. You want a beer, man – ?</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Sure –</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: you like Kobe’s game? I do. You think he’s heir
apparent to MJ? I do. He speaks fluent Italian, you know? So he’s got
that going for him –</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: You sure you’re okay – ?</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Yeah, man. Where is your beer?</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Cool. So you’re living up North?</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Yeah -</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: I heard you were pumping gas -</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Something like that -</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: You’re kind of cultivating a new look.</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Yeah –</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Nah. It’s a scratch.</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Okay –</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Hey, you want something to eat ?</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: What do you got … ?</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Not much. I got olives. You like olives?
Kalamata olives rule, I think. Ma likes the Calabrese. It’s more
mellow</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: There’s certainly a time and a place for a
mellow olive -</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Yeah, yeah. That’s what I’m thinking –</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: So what are you gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: “About what?”</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: About Calitri? No worries, man. I’ll call him.
He’s a reasonable dude …</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: I can see that -</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Yeah. He just wants to know I’m still on it. He
needs reassurance. All these big swinging dicks do. No worries. I won’t
let him get into our Kool-Aid…</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: What happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: You just got crushed in a car. You’re
bleeding all over your self. And you sit there - eating olives and
talking basketball, as if, at this very moment, people weren’t plotting
your demise …</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: C’mon, man… My “demise…” Overreaction</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: “Over–” You know - I can maybe understand,
since I been gone, you taking up this dumb-ass life of crime, and for
that I can partly blame myself. But what is baffling to me, is how,
since I been gone, you’ve become a complete and total moron–</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Hey, now -</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: He’s gonna kill you – !</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: I can handle it –</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: You can handle it?</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: I can handle it –</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: You can handle it?</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: I can handle it –</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: You?</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Me.</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: You?</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Me…</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: You don’t think so, huh?</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Not really … But you know… Maybe I’m wrong
…</p>
<p><strong>atley jackson</strong>: Nicolo, how’s the yellowtail
today?</p>
<p><strong>fisherman</strong>: Very nice, Atley. Very nice …</p>
<p><strong>atley jackson</strong>: You can’t get it any fresher than
this, Memphis … From the sea to my skillet … Nothing in between…</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: What’s with the fish thing – ?</p>
<p><strong>atley jackson</strong>: We can learn something from our Asian
friends. They smoke a thousand cigarettes a day; they’re completely
stressed and overworked; they drink like, well …</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Fish.</p>
<p><strong>atley jackson</strong>: And they still have the lowest rate
of cancer of anywhere in the world. You know why? All they eat is
seafood.</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Also, never underestimate the restorative
powers of “Karaoke.”</p>
<p><strong>atley jackson</strong>: I do a poaching number. Six-ounce
fillets in a saucepan of brine. In 8 minutes, I could cater a goddamn
wedding. Plain but flavorful. And it’s a good way to show off my
Hollandaise sauce …</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: You have a Hollandaise sauce ?</p>
<p><strong>atley jackson</strong>: I do … Christ, what happened to us
?</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Speak for yourself, boss I don’t have a
Hollandaise sauce</p>
<p><strong>atley jackson</strong>: No, but you dress like an asshole
…</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: I think about that night a lot…</p>
<p><strong>atley jackson</strong>: Me, too. Every time I walk…</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: How they were just there … Waiting on us …
The fix was definitely in …</p>
<p><strong>atley jackson</strong>: Yeah – ?</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Yeah Tell him to lay off Kip and them Tell
him it’s on</p>
<p><strong>atley jackson</strong>: Any idea how you’re gonna go at
it?</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Am I dying? Are all the angels of my life
returning to bid a final farewell? And have my angels completely lost
their fashion sense – ?</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Hello, Otto …</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: You remember Junie?</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Of course. Hi, Junie –</p>
<p><strong>junie</strong>: Hello, Memphis -</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: What happened here – ?</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Whatever do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: The chop-shop… Where are the stripped cars?
The rolled-back odometers? The part bins?</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: What happened? Old-age happened. I tired of
killing them. I woke up one morning and thought I am no longer a
destroyer. I am a means of resurrection. Now. We restore. We revive.
There are so few things in this life, we can prevent from decay. Most
must die. These don’t have to…</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: You, too, Otto</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: I heard rumors you were back. About Kip …</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: He’s gotten involved –</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: I can’t concentrate. Play something, my
sweetness; my reason to rise …</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: You think it can be done?</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Are you considering a comeback tour?</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Tell me…</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: It can be done. Take two days to shop; one to
prep. I’ll offer up my bible for a small fee. You also have to hope
Kip’s jerk-circus didn’t undo Castlebeck’s linkage so much so that he’s
setting up surveillance teams on every city block. And then get yourself
a crew…</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: The hard part …</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: “A people is a detour of nature to get 6 or 7
great men - Yes, and then to get around them…” Nietzsche said that.</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Is he still working here ?</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: The old crew. Go find them. I can’t help you
with that. Since I’ve cleaned up the act a bit, they no longer come
around… A pity how legitimacy makes you unpopular -</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: I Just don’t know how happy they’ll be to
see me</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: I remember I had a 1964 Buick Opal. worst car
ever built. Value job. Everything broke and I-fixed it. A coma car -
built to German specs. Plastic gas line. 3 speedometer head. On a quiet
night, you could hear it rusting in the garage. But when that car was
gone, I missed it. If it came driving back in here right now, there’d be
tears and laughter …</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: And the moral of that story is – ?</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Go to them. They’ll be happy to see you …
Ahhh…</p>
<p><strong>donny astricky</strong>: Pull over! Pull her the hell
over!</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>donny astricky</strong>: You ain’t sorry. You’re a horrible
driver… You can’t strap into your seat belt, without almost getting
creamed by a bus …</p>
<p><strong>donny astricky</strong>: Damn. Memphis Raines. Long time
…</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: How you doing, man?</p>
<p><strong>donny astricky</strong>: All I get are the Orientals. They
can build ’em, but they can’t drive ’em So? What are you doing here?
What’s with the outfit – ?</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: You know where the others are?</p>
<p><strong>donny astricky</strong>: Most of ‘em are gone. The Dyar Boys
are doing a nickel at Chino; Henry Santoro and Frankie Fish are moving
weight in Florida; Bill Doolin was killed in Denver… Atley Jackson’s on
the gimp and runnin’ errands for Calitri; The Sphinx is still around, I
guess … Then of course, there’s …</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Forget that …</p>
<p><strong>donny astricky</strong>: Okay. Figure it forgotten. What’s
this about anyways – ?</p>
<p><strong>donny astricky</strong>: Most of ’em are late-model…</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: That’s right. Only 10 exotics …</p>
<p><strong>donny astricky</strong>: We’ll have to start beating the
bushes, find out where they live…</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Some crew you got …</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: If we put out the word. That we’re
crewing-up, for a one-time-only job… What do you think that’ll
yield?</p>
<p><strong>donny astricky</strong>: A bunch of strung-out hypes and
stick- up men. This ain’t like the old days, Memphis. The profession has
lost its..</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Dignity…</p>
<p><strong>donny astricky</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Well, the three of us don’t’exactly inspire
confidence…</p>
<p><strong>donny astricky</strong>: Wow! They got Eleanor here – ?</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: I know. Weird, huh – ?</p>
<p><strong>worker</strong>: Otto, there’s someone here to –</p>
<p><strong>donny astricky</strong>: Lookit Kip. All grown up…</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Hey, Donny –</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Otto called -</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: You need him…</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: No we don’t -</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: I appreciate your dilemma, Memphis. But how
are two washed-up thieves and an old man supposed to boost 50 cars in
three days…</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: His criminal career has officially come to
a close …</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: The conundrum still applies, of course. The
purpose of the endeavor is to rescue baby brother from imminent death
and/or a life of crime. However. This cannot be successfully carried out
without baby brother’s considerable resources, shabby though they may
be.</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: We do this. Then. You’re finished. Then.
You’re clean</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: I like how you wallop back in here - after four
years - and can still get all Clifford Huxtable on my shit …</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: You hear me?</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: I hear ya. Get me outta this. I’ll move to the
country. Open a fruit stand…</p>
<p><strong>donny astricky</strong>: You guys have any skills at all?</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Hell, yeah. Mirror Man here is our electronics
expert. He’s got some gadgets you old farts maybe never -heard of;
Tumbler can drive anything with wheels, and some things without; Toby’s
a hacker, can do things with a computer, that are pretty amazing …</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: How old are you now, Toby?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Sixteen. But my birthday’s in seven months
…</p>
<p><strong>donny astricky</strong>: What about him?</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Freb can order pizzas like nobody’s
business</p>
<p><strong>freb</strong>: People gotta eat …</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Okay, then… Otto?</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: In order to succeed, you’re going to have to
go old-school. one night boost. Put all your nuts in one basket.
And…</p>
<p><strong>tumbler</strong>: One night? Are you nuts?</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: You got maybe a better plan?</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: You spread it out … you move around… So’s they
can’t touch you… so’s they don’t know… Shadow games and shit …</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: “Shadow games?”</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Shadow games …</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: You spread it out, by the 2nd night, the
heat are onto you. Know something’s up. With a one-night boost, by the
time all the cars are reported stolen, your ship’s set sail.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: We’re on a truncated time-table. Take a day to
shop it; a day to prep it … And we’re still going to need to expand the
crew…</p>
<p><strong>donny astricky</strong>: There’s no one left …</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: We’ve got several Italian cars on the list.
Always tricky, always timeconsuming. So we’re gonna need a specialist
…</p>
<p><strong>mirror man</strong>: You know of one – ?</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Yeah. He’s knows of one all right.</p>
<p><strong>drunk</strong>: One more, girl -</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: I think you’ve had enough, Billy…</p>
<p><strong>drunk</strong>: Enough? I haven’t even started, girl. Gimme
another –</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: If you leave now, Billy, you can get a
head-start on waking up in a pool of your own vomit…</p>
<p><strong>drunk</strong>: Listen, you little cooze–</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: Come back when you’ve learned how to drink,
Billy –</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: See you’re still stealing the sailors from
the sea –</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: What’s with the look?</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: The hip, cool, sexy thing was getting
old…</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: You look like you lost your sheep …</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: You still wrenching at Bacchiochi’s?</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: Hell, yeah. I’m not getting rich in here …</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Buy you a drink?</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: Nope. I got a coffee. And a boyfriend.</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: “Mitch?”</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: Mitch.</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: So I was replaced by Mitch?</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: No. You were replaced by Alex. Who was
replaced by Kevin. Who was replaced by Vince. Who was replaced by
Mitch…</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Wow. And to think all I accomplished these
past six years was the “LORD OF THE RINGS” trilogy…</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: Yeah, well, you always were a sucker for
flawed existences …</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: On account of Mitch?</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: On account of me.</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: I’ve taken the spear for a lot of people,
Sway. Including you. Can’t we improvise a little here … ?</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: No can do. Life goes on, pointfive … You left
me, remember?</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: I left town. I didn’t leave you.</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: A distinction worth noting …</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: And here I am…</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: Yes. But I got a feeling it’s not on account
of any longing-for-my-touch on your part -</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Kip’s in trouble</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: What kind of trouble – ?</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Kip took a job. Fifty ladies in two weeks.
Only the two weeks have turned into four days. And not a single lady has
been snared.</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: And you got some Italians – ?</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Six or seven…</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: I’m not doing it anymore. Haven’t for a while.
I’ve carved out something for myself. It’s pathetic, but it’s mine …</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: I understand -</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Another round, Sara -</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: Sure, Mitch -</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: How you doing, pal?</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: I’d go so far as to say “lovely.”</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: You should her face when she’s having sex
–</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Really…</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: What’s it look like?</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: What the hell are you doing – ?</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: If you change your mind. We’re at Otto’s.
It’s 50 ladies in 24 hours. For The Carpenter. 200 K and Kip’s life on
the felt. So long now …</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Who was that guy, Sara?</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: Good question …</p>
<p><strong>tumbler</strong>: Freb’s here. Open the gate.</p>
<p><strong>donny astricky</strong>: We sent him out on a solo boost. See
what he could do …</p>
<p><strong>freb</strong>: How do I look in this one?</p>
<p><strong>mirror man</strong>: Like a goofy white boy in a
Cadillac.</p>
<p><strong>donny astricky</strong>: How’d it go?</p>
<p><strong>freb</strong>: Keys were in it …</p>
<p><strong>donny astricky</strong>: Well, that defies the point, don’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>mirror man</strong>: You should ask him how he got the name
“Freb.”</p>
<p><strong>freb</strong>: Shaddup, man …</p>
<p><strong>donny astricky</strong>: Get the damn thing in there and get
it cleaned up -</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: This is loaded with crap - get a duffel.</p>
<p><strong>donny astricky</strong>: Lemme see that -</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: No shit?</p>
<p><strong>donny astricky</strong>: There’s gotta be a million bucks
worth here -</p>
<p><strong>tumbler</strong>: We’re rich. Goddamn, we’re rich!</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Where’d you pick her up?</p>
<p><strong>freb</strong>: In front of one of them poker parlors in
Chinatown …</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Well, take it back –</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Take it back? What do you mean take it back?
Are you crazy, man?</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Take it back, Freb –</p>
<p><strong>mirror man</strong>: Hey, now, Memphis… C’mon, man -</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Who is it – ?</p>
<p><strong>detective castlebeck</strong>: Castlebeck.</p>
<p><strong>donny astricky</strong>: Jesus. The whole damn thing’s
loaded.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: one minute – !</p>
<p><strong>detective castlebeck</strong>: I know you.</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: You know my back.</p>
<p><strong>detective castlebeck</strong>: What are you still doing here,
Randall?</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Stopped by to see Otto. Say hello.</p>
<p><strong>detective castlebeck</strong>: What’s this – ?</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Cadillac.</p>
<p><strong>detective castlebeck</strong>: What’s wrong with it – ?</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Needs brightening …</p>
<p><strong>detective castlebeck</strong>: Run me down a tag - 329 HRO.
Cadillac.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: No faith in our new-found goodness, Detective
…?</p>
<p><strong>detective castlebeck</strong>: Sure. But sometimes we got to
create some numbers. The task force is run by statistics, you know …</p>
<p><strong>radio</strong>: 329 HRO. There’s no want on the license at
this time…</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: You’re thinking: okay, there’s no want …
But they probably stripped its guts and crated ’em up, right … ?</p>
<p><strong>detective castlebeck</strong>: Something like that -</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Let her rip …</p>
<p><strong>detective castlebeck</strong>: Okay, then. I’ll catch you
later, Randall …</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Double-meaning intended, right?</p>
<p><strong>detective castlebeck</strong>: Right …</p>
<p><strong>detective castlebeck</strong>: It’s funny. There’s probably
been five more cars stolen in the time I’ve been here …</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: I don’t think so, Detective …</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Hey -</p>
<p><strong>helen raines</strong>: The photo album. I get nostalgic
around this time of year …</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: What time of year?</p>
<p><strong>helen raines</strong>: Tuesdays …</p>
<p><strong>photos</strong>: - childhood shots of Memphis and Kip, a
younger Helen; Memphis at 17, in his “Ike’s Garage” coveralls;
14year-old Memphis, an infant Kip, and their father a MAN with bright
eyes and a quiet smile, standing before an old Cutlass 442; Robert
Raines … Outside a car dealership. We can almost feel his strong, sure
presence …</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: You ever wonder what things’d be like if he
hadn’t died?</p>
<p><strong>helen raines</strong>: Every day. I wonder about that every
day…</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Kip and I’d probably be working at the
dealership… Imagine us selling cars?</p>
<p><strong>helen raines</strong>: And just in case you lose your keys,
good sir, I can toss in a complimentary slim-jim, free of charge …</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Mother – !</p>
<p><strong>helen raines</strong>: I remember. Supper getting cold, cos
you two are out there heads under hoods …</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: You remember that, Kip?</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: I was six …</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: After he died … I think that’s what I
missed most of all … That there was no different cars every night … When
I started hanging around Otto’s … And he started showing me the things …
It was a way to kill two birds … Put food on the table for you and Kip …
And … Ride in different cars every night … Just like when Dad was
here.</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Ancient history’s two things. “Ancient.” And
“history!”</p>
<p><strong>helen raines</strong>: I know…</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: We do it. He’ll get clear Once and for
all</p>
<p><strong>donny astricky</strong>: Car-jacking is the lazy man’s boost.
No skill. No finesse. Can only take the car if the key is in it. That’s
not thieving. That’s parking … Thugs … With the decency of dirt …</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: They’re just cars, man …</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: This Eleanor’s been living at the
International Towers for 3 years now.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Who’s “Eleanor?”</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: The 167 Mustang Shelby Mustang GT-500.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Why do you call it “Eleanor?”</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: All the vehicles get code names. Female
names. You say “Eleanor lives at such and such…” and no one listening on
the waves is the wiser …</p>
<p><strong>donny astricky</strong>: Eleanor is Memphis’ “unicorn.”</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: And there she is –</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: It looks just like a regular Mustang –</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Don’t go there, Toby –</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: She’s not. Carroll Shelby tweaked the
Mustang’s High-Performance 289 engine and got it legally rated for the
street at 450 horsepower … But its actual output is closer to 600 …</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: So she flies -</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: She soars -</p>
<p><strong>donny astricky</strong>: Grade-A unicorn …</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: What’s a “unicorn?”</p>
<p><strong>donny astricky</strong>: Fabled creature. You know - the
horse with the horn? Impossible to capture?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: You guys and the car thing, man –</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: See you in a few days, Eleanor –</p>
<p><strong>mirror man</strong>: And you just stick it in the lock. Hit
this little button … And …</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: We’re dinosaurs, Donny. Pull-up a tar pit …
Can I try – ?</p>
<p><strong>mirror man</strong>: Knock yourself out –</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I logged outside the G.R.A.B. site, right?
Then I monitored their incoming outside data requests, right? Then I got
these ISDN numbers, right? Then I tracked them back, right? Then I took
the one I could jack-up the easiest, right? Then I called back see, they
think I’m an insurance company - that’s where it looks like I’m coming
from – and they’re sharing stats with this insurance company, right? So
now they’re sharing it with me, right? They think I’m looking for stats
for an actuarial conference on auto-theft. So they let me in, right?
Give me all these numbers. But then I don’t leave, right? I’m in. I’ve
got the key. Now I just go anywhere I want.</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: So what’s in there – ?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I can tell you who’s gonna be on duty tonight.
I can tell you how much gas they’re using monthly. I can tell you how
they used to spend that annoying half-hour between “FRIENDS” and
“SEINFELD”…</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Good work, Toby –</p>
<p><strong>freb</strong>: It just ain’t happening –</p>
<p><strong>donny astricky</strong>: You’ll get the hang of it, kid. You
just need to remember one thing -</p>
<p><strong>freb</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>donny astricky</strong>: On boost night? Always take along a
good mix tape …</p>
<p><strong>freb</strong>: I guess …</p>
<p><strong>donny astricky</strong>: You got a school teacher or Nancy
from accounting, you don’t put on Sly Stone or James Brown. You put on
Ravel. Rachmaninoff. But if you got some wild one you just picked up at
the track, you wouldn’t put on Cat Stevens or James Taylor. You’d put on
Prince. Or Isaac Hayes. Or, if you really wanted to get after it:
Miles.</p>
<p><strong>freb</strong>: okay …</p>
<p><strong>donny astricky</strong>: It’s the same way with cars.
Different cars. Different tunes. You can’t steal a Maserati listening to
Sinatra. You gotta get urgent. You gotta get Sonny Rollins or Led
Zeppelin IV, on that shit. But never, never-ever take no Allman Brothers
into a Lincoln Town Car. Could lead to disaster. Got it… ?</p>
<p><strong>freb</strong>: Got it …</p>
<p><strong>donny astricky</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: Janis Joplin. Billie Holliday. Ella
Fitzgerald…</p>
<p><strong>donny astricky</strong>: Gender bias …</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: I’ve missed you, Sara Wayland –</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: Good to see ya, Otto –</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: How ya doing, Sway – ?</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: Kip…</p>
<p><strong>donny astricky</strong>: What do you think about all
this?</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: Stick it in the drawer marked “Fool’s Errand”,
right – ?</p>
<p><strong>donny astricky</strong>: That’s my girl –</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: That’s Mirror Man … And that’s Freb … And
Tumbler … And Toby … Fellas, this is Sara Wayland… They call her
“Sway.”</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: Hey -</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Of course …</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: Good. Just so we understand…</p>
<p><strong>donny astricky</strong>: Well, well, well. The original crash
test dummy…</p>
<p><strong>freb</strong>: Who’s that – ?</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: That’s The Sphinx.</p>
<p><strong>freb</strong>: The Sphinx?</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: He never says a word. And he’s got a messed-up
nose. Hence. The Sphinx. He’s boo-koo koo-koo. But he steals like time …
Hello, Sphinxy, old rum – !</p>

<p><strong>kip</strong>: Peugot convertible …</p>
<p><strong>donny astricky</strong>: What color?</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Gray.</p>
<p><strong>freb</strong>: How you know that?</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Remember who my brother is?</p>
<p><strong>mirror man</strong>: Fuck that cracker shit –</p>
<p><strong>tumbler</strong>: I know that one. General Lee, I believe,
was a … Dodge Charger …</p>
<p><strong>donny astricky</strong>: You ever notice how it had a
different interior every week? That bugged me.</p>
<p><strong>mirror man</strong>: Three words: Get A Life.</p>
<p><strong>donny astricky</strong>: I’d like the names and addresses of
the owners of these 20 cars please…</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: It’ll take me about 15 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>donny astricky</strong>: I can wait.</p>
<p><strong>freb</strong>: Okay, okay. What about MAGNUM P.I.?</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Thanks for playing, Freb. That’s a gimme …</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Yes, but what was on the license plate?</p>
<p><strong>mirror man</strong>: The license plate?</p>
<p><strong>tumbler</strong>: I know. “ROBIN 1.”</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Very good. But what was the significance of
“ROBIN 1”?</p>
<p><strong>freb</strong>: Was that his first name?</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: His first name was Thomas. Thomas Magnum…</p>
<p><strong>donny astricky</strong>: Thomas Sullivan Magnum, to be
exact.</p>
<p><strong>tumbler</strong>: Robin 1 …</p>
<p><strong>mirror man</strong>: I know! Robin was the name of that faggy
guy who hung with him…</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: No. That was Higgins ….</p>
<p><strong>donny astricky</strong>: Jonathan Quayle Higgins …</p>
<p><strong>mirror man</strong>: You’re like a serial killer,
ainchoo?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: It’s two dollars per car. That’ll be 40
dollars please…</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Anyone? The significance of “Robin 1” on
Magnum’s license plate? Memphis?</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Robin was Robin Masters. He owned the
estate they lived on …</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Ten points for our fearless leader … Sway, how
’bout giving us the honor of the Bill Bixby trifecta – ?</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: I don’t know that</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Stumped – !</p>
<p><strong>freb</strong>: Thank-God, Sway, you ain’t all freaky- deaky,
too</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: How about: a Corvette in MAGICIAN; a Ford
pick-up truck in INCREDIZLE HULK, and…</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Here’s where it gets tricky …</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: … he walked in THE COURTSHIP OF</p>
<p><strong>donny astricky</strong>: Walked like a bastard… Skippin’
stones and shit..</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: That’s a good one, Donny…</p>
<p><strong>donny astricky</strong>: I think so too –</p>
<p><strong>mirror man</strong>: Ya’ll really need to get the fuck out of
the house more…</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Hello – ?</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: What’s wrong with her – ?</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: The right side of the engine is running richer
than the left. And the scope isn’t showing shit… I dunno…</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Annie – ?</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: You haven’t been studying –</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Right. Great car. One of a kind. I was
looking forward to that boost myself</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: She was the only “Annie” you could find?</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: They only made a handful. We’re lucky
there’s even one living in the area…</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: Yeah, well … She lives with District Court
Judge Seymour Croft …</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: … and he keeps “Annie’ in his living room…
Like a work of art …</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: She’s got 27 miles on her o-dom. Which is
exactly how far away the custom shop was in 1979 when he bought her… He
drove her home, never drove her again …</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: The man’s a freak…</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: She’s trouble –</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: I put the boys on it. They’re clever that
way…</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: I go with you –</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: That what you want?</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: That’s what I want …</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: You mentioned that in your letters</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: I always thought you’d follow me up.</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: We were good when you bailed, weren’t we?</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Very good…</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: Cos there were those dark days, when I figured
- my God, how easy it was for him to just give it up; to make the deal;
take the rot for the whole crew … And give me up in the process.</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: No way …</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: No … ?</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: No …</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: Don’t go getting all warm and fuzzy on me,
Randall. I’m the jane that was left, and you’re the jim that did the
leaving. So save the sanctimonious shit for someone who believes. The
only reason I ride with you, is cause I don’t want to spend the whole
night with any of them other creeps!</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Oh. Okay. Right.</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: I’m on the move -</p>
<p><strong>detective castlebeck</strong>: Your girl works in there …</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Not my girl anymore</p>
<p><strong>detective castlebeck</strong>: Yet your still here … I gave
you 24 hours, 24 hours ago …</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: What do you want from me?</p>
<p><strong>detective castlebeck</strong>: Honestly? I want to - once
every few months - get into my car. Pack a lunch. And drive on up to
Chino. On visiting day. Bring you some magazines. Maybe some almond
clusters. And see you all bright and shiny in your orange jumpsuit.
That’s what I want …</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: This one …</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Reads the infrared. Then kills it. Little
something the R &amp; D department came up with …</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: How long were you gonna let me try and stop
it…?</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: After a while, it became a little pathetic …
Figured I’d put you out of your misery …</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Thank-you …</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: De nada …</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Ain’t we good-timing here … ?</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: The family that steals together, deals
together…</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Dad’d be proud –</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Maybe not. But Dad was from another era…</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: What era was that – ?</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: The era when crime didn’t pay –</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: As opposed to now, Kid Car Crusher?</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Price of doing business…</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: What about just getting a job, 9 to 5, five
days a week, that whole mystery achievement – ?</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: It’s for assholes. The Legal Buck blows,
Memphis. You know that. Doing this, we make mad bank, my boys are down,
the girlies come around and the boosts are a breeze. Yeah, sure, you’re
gonna get jacked-up every now and then - but ain’t that a small price to
pay for never, never-ever, having to say “paper or plastic?”</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: We’ve got to shake them tomorrow night. I’m
making that your problem. That’s called delegation of duties. You like
it – ?</p>
<p><strong>mirror man</strong>: Sure, man –</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Okay. Tomorrow night it’s on. Each team has
been assigned their ladies. The teams are: me and Sway. Donny and Freb.
Kip and Tumbler. Mirror Man, you and The Sphinx …</p>
<p><strong>mirror man</strong>: Aw, c’mon, man …</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: What about me?</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: You’ll be at the docks … Keeping Otto
abreast of our progress …</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: How come … ?</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Because you should be home with Nintendo,
listening to The Spice Girls, little man …</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Come on. Kip, talk to the guy</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: There’s no talkin’ to him –</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: To a safe and successful session of bumping
fenders and trading paint.</p>
<p><strong>beach boys</strong>: “Well, I’m not braggin,’ babe So don’t
put me down But I got the fastest set of wheels in town, etc.”</p>
<p><strong>calitri</strong>: This is how you’re spending my time? Having
a sock hop?</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Everyone know Ray Calitri? Pillar of the
community …</p>
<p><strong>calitri</strong>: Look at this. A multi-generational
gathering of scumbags …</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: So saith the God of Scumbags –</p>
<p><strong>calitri</strong>: Hello, Otto. My boys at the dock report no
cars have yet to be delivered. And there’s only one more night …</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Getting nervous, Ray? What happens to you, I
wonder, if delivery isn’t made?</p>
<p><strong>calitri</strong>: With all the free time I’ve had not
counting cars as they’re loaded onto my ship, I’ve managed to sand the
cedar inside your box, Kip. This will protect you from the anaerobic
bacteria, that normally thrives in an airless; environment. Thus
prolonging decay …</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Get out of here, Ray –</p>
<p><strong>calitri</strong>: One more night –</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Get out –</p>
<p><strong>calitri</strong>: I hope you know what you’re doing. God help
you if you don’t …</p>
<p><strong>drycoff</strong>: Oh, this is a good time –</p>
<p><strong>hawkings</strong>: How much can one man smoke?</p>
<p><strong>drycoff</strong>: It’s a crime, ain’t it? Cos Castlebeck’s
got a bug up his ass over this guy, I gotta get lung cancer …</p>
<p><strong>donny</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>tumbler</strong>: Watch and learn, old-timer –</p>
<p><strong>donny</strong>: The hell are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>mirror man</strong>: Delivering ordnance. Y2K-style.</p>
<p><strong>tumbler</strong>: The Hemi Has Landed –</p>
<p><strong>donny</strong>: Big deal. Now what?</p>
<p><strong>mirror man</strong>: What we call: fun and shit.</p>
<p><strong>tumbler</strong>: We can go now –</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Yes, this is a message for Mr. Seymour Croft,
of 1443 Locklin … This is the Department of Water and Power and we’re
going to be doing some work in your area tonight … If you’d please call

<p><strong>toby</strong>: Yes, sir -</p>
<p><strong>judge croft</strong>: Okay, then … I just go to the Marriott
and I’m set …</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: You’ve been pre-booked…</p>
<p><strong>donny astricky</strong>: I miss Orville Redenbacher already
–</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Okay, okay. The important thing to
remember, is to Think Slow. Take your time. It may not seem like it, but
the night is long. Long enough. Just think slow and think smart…</p>
<p><strong>drycoff</strong>: Let’s see what these bastards are up to
–</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: How we doing, O – ?</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Ready to start erasing. Good luck, kiddies

<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Okay. All our ladies should be home now,

necessary… Otto’s default HQ … Let’s go get ’em…</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Ready – ?</p>

<p><strong>memphis</strong>: No. Open her …</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: What the hell’s that – ?</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: A little trick I picked up at the Car Thief
Retirement Home …</p>
<p><strong>freb</strong>: Diane 1.</p>
<p><strong>donny astricky</strong>: Very good. Think you can get in
without waking her up – ?</p>
<p><strong>freb</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>donny astricky</strong>: That’s an after-market alarm. Can’t
just cut her wires …</p>
<p><strong>mirror man</strong>: This is some state-of-the-art shit, kid.
The drill breaks the sockets, which force back the spindle and release
the lock …only it doesn’t seem to be working… And The Sphinx is getting
impatient …</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Gosh, no. Lipstick? What next? Mascara,
blush, floral-print dresses?</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: Deodorant.</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Wow. Bozo, the very sexy clown –</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: So, you seeing anybody?</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: No. I had a girl. She was great. The
problem is: great girls come along once every ten years. So I gotta wait
another three years before I can even bother to look…</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: She was so great, why’d you leave her?</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Her parole officer strongly recommended it
…</p>
<p><strong>donny astricky</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>freb</strong>: It’s all microchips and shit …</p>
<p><strong>donny astricky</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>freb</strong>: Cool …</p>

<p><strong>mirror man</strong>: Oh, I get it: old school.</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: How’s it going?</p>
<p><strong>mirror man</strong>: It’s going fine. The Quiet Riot and me
are swapping trade secrets …</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: It’s just… so… beautiful …</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: C’mon, gang. Let’s focus. Sway, can you
prep ’em – ?</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: I think so… They’re just… So …</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: I know. But let’s prep ’em. We could stay

<p><strong>donny astricky</strong>: So? Tell me: how come they call you
“Freb” anyways – ?</p>
<p><strong>freb</strong>: C’mon, man …</p>
<p><strong>donny astricky</strong>: We’re partners here –</p>
<p><strong>freb</strong>: My names “Fred.” You know: Frederick? One
drunk night, I decided to give myself a tattoo. Hot needle it. I used a

<p><strong>memphis</strong>: You okay – ?</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: I’m cool.</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Too early to tell. Nervous?</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Nah.</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: That’s strange. I’m nervous. Donny’s
nervous. Everyone’s nervous. But not you…</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: I dunno. Whatever will be will be…</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: That’s a good attitude, Kip. For everything
but stealing cars …</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Hello, Tracy…</p>

<p><strong>mirror man</strong>: That’s what I’m talkin’ about – !</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: … okay, check with you soon …</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: They’re in love …</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: What about you?</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: You remember my Gramma? Yeah. I was thinking.
If she were alive. And she asked me. If she came down, right now. Asked
me. “What do you do, Sara? What’s your life?” Innocently.
Nonjudgemental. I think it would break her heart if I said I was a
thief. I steal cars, Gramma. And even though, hey, I learned it all from
her son. My Uncle Eddie. Who taught me the basics. Which you refined.
Gramma? You thought he was neat. Well, . I don’t think that’s what she
hoped for me…</p>
<p><strong>detective drycoff</strong>: It’s an epidemic, Rollie … I’m
getting reports every five minutes …</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: Arright … Enough … I can’t have you bellying
up to my heart again, man, f you can’t help falling off the stool. But
he puts his mouth to her ears …</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Shhh… Car thieves are your weakness.</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: Stop. What about Maserati Boy?</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: I take out my slim-jim…</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: Oh, God…</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Slip it in …</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: You’re going high-cheese, dude –</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Unlock your button …</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: “Unlock my button” … ?</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: The alarms go off …</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: Woo-woo-wooooo!</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: I pop your hood; find your siren wires</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: They’re factory alarms … Easy to get around…
For a man with… Skills…</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: I do … I cut “em…</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: Cut ’em…</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Now… I’m in …</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: Of course you are. You’re a professional…</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: I ratchet your ignition mechanism …</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: I bet you say that to all the girls…</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: With a twist of my wrist … You’re turned
over …</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: Wrong preposition…</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Hear you roar …</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: What about The Club … ?</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: Let me worry about The Club …</p>
<p><strong>sway</strong>: No worries …</p>
<p><strong>memphis</strong>: I’ve got you floored… We’re off … Take the
curb… Man, can you corner… Know not to get on it … Momentum shift …
Don’t get on those brakes too hard … Get her up on her tires. Up on her

<p><strong>sway</strong>: Nothing. Just that if I was less secure, I
might think you were more into Eleanor than you are me…</p>
