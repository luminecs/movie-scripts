<p><strong>mr. incredible</strong>: Is this on?</p>
<p><strong>interviewer</strong>: That’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>mr. incredible</strong>: I can break through walls, I just
can’t…</p>
<p><strong>interviewer</strong>: That’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>mr. incredible</strong>: I can’t get this on.</p>
<p><strong>interviewer</strong>: So, Mr. Incredible…do you have a secret
identity?</p>
<p><strong>mr. incredible</strong>: Every superhero has a secret
identity. I don’t know a single one who doesn’t. Who wants the pressure
of being super all the time?</p>
<p><strong>elastigirl</strong>: Of course I have a secret identity. Can
you see me in this at the supermarket? Come on. Who’d want to go
shopping as Elastigirl, y’know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>frozone</strong>: Superladies, they’re always trying to tell
you their secret identity. Think it’ll strengthen the relationship or
something like that. I said, ‘’Girl, I don’t want to know about your
mild-mannered alter ego.’’ or anything like that. I mean, you tell me
you’re a super-mega-ultra-lightning-babe, that’s all right with me. I’m
good. I’m good.</p>
<p><strong>mr. incredible</strong>: No matter how many times you save
the world, it always manages to get back in jeopardy again. Sometimes I
just want it to stay saved, you know? For a little bit. I feel like the
maid. ‘’I just cleaned up this mess. Can we keep it clean for ten
minutes?’’</p>
<p><strong>interviewer</strong>: I could get to that point.</p>
<p><strong>mr. incredible</strong>: ‘’Please?’’</p>
<p><strong>interviewer</strong>: Wait, no, don’t get up. We’re not
finished.</p>
<p><strong>mr. incredible</strong>: Sometimes l think I’d just like the
simple life, you know? Relax a little and raise a family.</p>
<p><strong>elastigirl</strong>: Settle down? Are you kidding? I’m at the
top of my game! I’m right up there with the big dogs! Girls, come on.
Leave the saving of the world to the men? I don’t think so. I don’t
think so.</p>
<p><strong>__________________________________________scene</strong>:
2__________________________________________</p>
<p><strong>police radio</strong>: We interrupt for an important
bulletin. A deadly high-speed pursuit between police and armed gunmen is
underway, traveling northbound on San Pablo Ave.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Yeah, I’ve got time.</p>
<p><strong>old lady</strong>: Mr. lncredible. Um, Mr. Incredible…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What is it, ma’am?</p>
<p><strong>old lady</strong>: My cat, Squeaker, won’t come down.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Certainly, ma’am but I suggest you stand clear.
There could be trouble.</p>
<p><strong>old lady</strong>: No, no. He’s quite tame.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Let go now!</p>
<p><strong>police officer 1</strong>: Thank you, Mr. lncredible. You’ve
done it again.</p>
<p><strong>police officer 2</strong>: Yeah, you’re the best.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: No, I’m just here to help.</p>
<p><strong>police radio</strong>: Attention all units. We have a tour
bus robbery…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Tour bus robbery. I’ve still got time.
Officers. Ma’am. Squeaker.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Cool! Ready for take-off!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What the…? Who are you supposed to be?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Well, I’m lncrediBoy.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What? No. You’re that kid from the fan club.
Brophy. Brody. Buddy! Buddy!</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: My name is lncrediBoy.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Look, I’ve been nice, I’ve stood for photos,
signed every scrap of paper you pushed at me but this is…</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: No, you don’t have to worry about training
me. I know all your moves, your crime fighting style, favorite catch
phrases, everything! I’m your number one fan!</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Hey! Hey, wait!</p>
<p><strong>__________________________________________scene</strong>:
3__________________________________________</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You know…you can tell a lot about a woman by
the contents of her purse, but maybe that’s not what you had in
mind.</p>
<p><strong>thief</strong>: Hey, look–</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Elastigirl.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Mr. lncredible.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: No, it’s all right. I’ve got him.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Sure, you’ve got him. I just took him out for
you.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Sure, you took him out. His attention was on
me.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: A fact I exploited to do my job.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: My job, you mean.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: A simple thank you will suffice.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Thanks, but I don’t need any help.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Whatever happened to ‘’ladies first’’?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Well, whatever happened to equal treatment?</p>
<p><strong>thief</strong>: Hey, look, the lady got me first.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Well, we could share, you know.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I work alone.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Well, I think you need to be
more…flexible.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Are you doing anything later?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I have a previous engagement.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Now, you just stay here. They usually pick up
the garbage in an hour.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: Hey, lncredible!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Hey, Frozone!</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: Shouldn’t you be getting ready?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I still got time.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: He’s gonna jump!</p>
<p><strong>sansweet</strong>: I think you broke something.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: With counseling, I think you’ll come to forgive
me.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Wait a minute.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Bomb Voyage.</p>
<p><strong>voyage</strong>: Mr. Incredible!</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: And lncrediBoy!</p>
<p><strong>voyage</strong>: lncrediBoy?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Hey, hey! Aren’t you curious about how I get
around so fast? See? I have these rocket boots–</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Go home, Buddy.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Now.</p>
<p><strong>voyage</strong>: Little oaf.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Can we talk? You always say be true to
yourself, but you never say which part of yourself to be true to. Well,
I’ve finally figured out who I am. I am your ward… lncrediBoy!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: And now, you have officially carried it too
far, Buddy.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: This is because I don’t have powers, isn’t
it? Well not every superhero has powers, you know. You can be super
without them. I invented these. I can fly. Can you fly?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Fly home, Buddy. I work alone.</p>
<p><strong>voyage</strong>: And your outfit is totally ridiculous!</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Just give me one chance! I’ll show you. I’ll
go get the police.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Buddy, don’t!</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: It’ll only take a second, really.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: No, stop! There’s a bomb!</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Let go! You’re wrecking my flight pattern! I
can do this if you let go!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Will you just…? I’m trying to help! Stop!</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Let go of my cape!</p>
<p><strong>__________________________________________scene</strong>:
4__________________________________________</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Take this one home. And make sure his mom knows
what he’s been doing.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: I can help you. You’re making a
mista—hey!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: The injured jumper. You sent paramedics?</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: They’ve already picked him up.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: The blast in that building was caused by Bomb
Voyage who I caught in the act robbing the vault. Now, we might be able
to nab him if we set up a perimeter.</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: You mean he got away?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Well, yeah. Skippy here made sure of that.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: lncrediBoy!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You’re not affiliated with me! Holy smokes, I’m
late. Listen, I’ve gotta be somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: What about Bomb Voyage?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Any other night, I’d go after him myself, but I
really gotta go. But don’t worry. We’ll get him! Eventually!</p>
<p><strong>__________________________________________scene</strong>:
5__________________________________________</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Is the night still young?</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: You’re very late.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: How do I look? Good?</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: Oh, the mask! You still got the mask.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Showtime.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Robert Parr, will you have this woman to be
your lawful wedded wife?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: You’re late. When you asked me if I was doing
anything later, I didn’t realize you’d actually forgotten. I thought it
was playful banter.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: It was playful banter.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Cutting it kinda close, don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You need to be more… flexible.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I love you, but if we’re gonna make this
work, you’ve gotta be more than Mr. lncredible. You know that. Don’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: …so long as you both shall live?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: I pronounce this couple husband and
wife.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: As long as we both shall live. No matter what
happens.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Hey, come on. We’re superheroes. What could
happen?</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: In a stunning turn of events, a superhero
is being sued for saving someone who, apparently, didn’t want to be
saved. The plaintiff, Oliver Sansweet, who was foiled in his attempted
suicide by Mr. Incredible, has filed suit against the famed superhero in
Superior Court.</p>
<p><strong>sansweet’s lawyer</strong>: Mr. Sansweet didn’t ask to be
saved. Mr. Sansweet didn’t want to be saved. And the injury received
from Mr. Incredible ‘’actions’’, so quote, causes him daily pain.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Hey, I saved your life!</p>
<p><strong>sansweet</strong>: You didn’t save my life! You ruined my
death, that’s what you did!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Listen–</p>
<p><strong>mr. incredible’s lawyer</strong>: My client has no further
comment at this time.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Five days later, another suit was filed
by victims of the el train accident. Incredible’s court losses cost the
government millions. And opened the flood gates for dozens of superhero
lawsuits the world over.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: It is time for their secret identity to
become their only identity. Time for them to join us, or go away.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Under tremendous public pressure, and the
crushing financial burden of an ever mounting series of lawsuits, the
government quietly initiated the superhero relocation program. The
supers will be granted amnesty from responsibility for past actions, in
exchange for the promise to never again resume hero work. Where are they
now? They are living among us. Average citizens, average heroes. Quietly
and anonymously continuing to make the world a better place.</p>
<p><strong>__________________________________________scene</strong>:
6__________________________________________</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hogenson</strong>: Denied? You’re denying my claim? I
don’t understand. I have full coverage.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I’m sorry, Mrs. Hogenson, but our liability is
spelled out in paragraph 17. It states clearly…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hogenson</strong>: I can’t pay for this.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Claims, Bob Parr.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I’m calling to celebrate a momentous
occasion. We’re now officially moved in.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Yeah, well, that’s great, honey. In the last
three years don’t count because…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Because I finally unpacked the last box. Now,
it’s official. Ha, ha, ha. Why do we have so much junk?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Listen, honey, I’ve got a client.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Say no more. Go save the world one policy at
a time, honey. Oh! I gotta go pick up the kids from school. See you
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Bye, honey. Excuse me. Where were we?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hogenson</strong>: I’m on a fixed income, and if you
can’t help me, I don’t know what I’ll do.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: All right, listen closely. I’d like to help
you, but I can’t. I’d like to tell you to take a copy of your policy to
Norma Wilcox on… Norma Wilcox. W-l-L-C-O-X. On the third floor. But I
can’t. I also do not advise you to fill out and file a WS2475 form with
our legal department on the second floor. I wouldn’t expect someone to
get back to you quickly to resolve the matter. I’d like to help, but
there’s nothing I can do.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hogenson</strong>: Oh, thank you, young man.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Shhh! I’m sorry, ma’am! I know you’re upset!
Pretend to be upset.</p>
<p><strong>mr. huph</strong>: Parr! You authorized payment on the Walker
policy?!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Someone broke into their house, Mr. Huph. Their
policy clearly covers–</p>
<p><strong>mr. huph</strong>: I don’t wanna know about their coverage,
Bob! Don’t tell me about their coverage. Tell me how you’re keeping
Insuricare in the black. Tell me how that’s possible, with you writing
checks to every Harry Hardluck and Sally Sobstory that gives you a phone
call.</p>
<p><strong>__________________________________________scene</strong>:
7__________________________________________</p>
<p><strong>principal</strong>: I appreciate you coming down here,
Mrs. Parr.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What’s this about? Has Dash done something
wrong?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: He’s a disruptive influence and he openly
mocks me in front of the class.</p>
<p><strong>dash</strong>: He says.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Look, I know it’s you! He puts thumbtacks on
my stool.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: You saw him do this?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Well…not really. No. Actually, not.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh, then how do you know it was him?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: I hid a camera. Yeah, and this time, I’ve
got him. See? You see? You don’t see it? He moves! Right there! Wait,
wait! Right there! Right as I’m sitting down! I don’t know how he does
it, but there’s no tack before he moves and after he moves, there’s a
tack. Coincidence? I think not!</p>
<p><strong>principal</strong>: Bernie…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Don’t ‘’Bernie’’ me. This little rat is
guilty!</p>
<p><strong>principal</strong>: You and your son can go now, Mrs. Parr.
I’m sorry for the trouble.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: You’re letting him go again? He’s guilty!
You can see it on his smug little face. Guilty, I say, guilty!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Dash, this is the third time this year you’ve
been sent to the office. We need to find a better outlet. A
more…constructive outlet.</p>
<p><strong>dash</strong>: Maybe I could, if you’d let me go out for
sports.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Honey, you know why we can’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>dash</strong>: I promise I’ll slow up. I’ll only be the best
by a tiny bit.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Dashiell Robert Parr, you are an incredibly
competitive boy. And a bit of a showoff. The last thing you need is
temptation.</p>
<p><strong>dash</strong>: You always say, ‘’Do your best.’’ But you
don’t really mean it. Why can’t I do the best that I can do?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Right now, honey, the world just wants us to
fit in, and to fit in, we just gotta be like everybody else.</p>
<p><strong>dash</strong>: Dad always said our powers were nothing to be
ashamed of. Our powers made us special.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Everyone’s special, Dash.</p>
<p><strong>dash</strong>: Which is another way of saying no one is.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Hey, Rydinger. Where you headed?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Hi, Tony.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Hey, Tony, can I carry your books?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: That’s kind of funny.</p>
<p><strong>boy 1</strong>: Hey, Tony, do you play football?</p>
<p><strong>boy 2</strong>: Tony, I thought we were gonna go
swimming.</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: He looked at me.</p>
<p><strong>dash</strong>: Come on, Violet!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Darn kids. Sitting on the driveway…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Oh, great.</p>
<p><strong>__________________________________________scene</strong>:

<p><strong>dash</strong>: Mom. You’re making weird faces again.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: No, I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You make weird faces, honey.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Do you have to read at the table?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Uh-huh. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Smaller bites, Dash. Yikes! Bob, could you
help the carnivore cut his meat?</p>
<p><strong>dash</strong>: Ow.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Dash, you have something you wanna tell your
father about school?</p>
<p><strong>dash</strong>: Well, we dissected a frog.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Dash got sent to the office again.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Good. Good.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: No, Bob, that’s bad.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Dash got sent to the office again.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What?! What for?</p>
<p><strong>dash</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: He put a tack on the teacher’s chair…during
class.</p>
<p><strong>dash</strong>: Nobody saw me. You could barely see it on the
tape.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: They caught you on tape and you still got away
with it? Whoa! You must have been booking. How fast did you think were
you going?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Bob! We are not encouraging this.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I’m not encouraging, I’m just asking how
fast…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Honey!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Great. First the car, now I gotta pay to fix
the table…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: The car? What happened to the car?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Here. I’m getting a new plate.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: So, how about you, Vi? How was school?</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: Nothing to report.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: You’ve hardly touched your food.</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: I’m not hungry for meatloaf.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Well, it is leftover night. We have steak,
pasta. What are you hungry for?</p>
<p><strong>dash</strong>: Tony Rydinger.</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>dash</strong>: Well, you are.</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: I said, shut up, you little insect!</p>
<p><strong>dash</strong>: Well, she is.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Do not shout at the table. Honey!</p>

<p><strong>dash</strong>: She’d eat if we were having Tony loaf.</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: That’s it!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Stop it!</p>
<p><strong>dash</strong>: You’re gonna be toast!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Stop running in the house. Sit down!</p>
<p><strong>dash</strong>: Ow! Hey, no force fields!</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: You started it.</p>

<p><strong>bob</strong>: ‘’Simon J. Paladino, longtime advocate of
superhero rights, is missing’’? Gazerbeam.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Bob! It’s time to engage. Do something! Don’t
just stand there! I need you to intervene!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You want me to intervene? Okay. I’m
intervening. I’m intervening!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Violet, let go of your brother!</p>

<p><strong>lucius</strong>: Hey, Speedo. Hey, Helen. Vi, Jack-Jack.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: He-hey! Ice of you to drop by.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: Ha! Never heard that one before.</p>
<p><strong>dash</strong>: Lucius!</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: Whoa!</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: Ha, ha.</p>
<p><strong>dash</strong>: Oh! I like it when it shatters.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I’ll be back later.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Hey, where are you two going?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: It’s Wednesday.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh. Bowling night. Say hello to Honey for me,
Lucius.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: Will do. Good night, Helen. Good night,
kids.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Don’t think you’ve avoided talking about your
trip to the principal’s office, young man. Your father and I are still
gonna discuss it.</p>
<p><strong>dash</strong>: I’m not the only kid who’s been sent to the
office, you know.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Other kids don’t have superpowers. Now, it’s
perfectly normal…</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: Normal? What do you know about normal? What
does anyone in this family know about normal?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Now, wait a minute, young lady.</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: We act normal, mom. I wanna be normal! The
only normal one is Jack-Jack, and he’s not even toilet trained.</p>
<p><strong>dash</strong>: Lucky. I meant about being normal.</p>

jolt of this death ray and I’m an epitaph. Somehow I managed to find
cover and what does Baron Von Ruthless do?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: He starts monologuing.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: He starts monologuing! He starts like this
prepared speech about how feeble I am compared to him. How inevitable my
defeat is, how the world will soon be his! Yada, yada, yada.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Yammering.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: Yammering! I mean, the guy has me on a
platter, and he won’t shut up.</p>
<p><strong>police radio</strong>: Municiberg, we have a 23-56…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: 23-56, what is that? Robbery?</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: This is just sad.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Yeah, robbery. Want to catch a robber?</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: No. Tell you the truth, I’d rather go
bowling. Look, what if we actually did what our wives think we’re doing?
Just to shake things up.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: He’s not alone. The fat guy’s still with him.
They’re just talking.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: What are we doing here, Bob?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Protecting people.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: Nobody asked us.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You need an invitation?</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: I’d like one, yes. We keep sneaking out to
do this, and…you remember Gazerbeam?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Yeah. There was something about him in the
paper.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: He had trouble adjusting to civilian life,
too.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: When’s the last time you saw him?</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: I don’t see anyone from the old days, Bob.
Just you. And we’re pushing our luck as it is.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Oh, come on.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: It was fun the first time, but if we keep
doing this, we’re gonna get–</p>
<p><strong>police radio</strong>: We have a report on a fire…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: A fire. We’re close! Yeah, baby!</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: We’re gonna get caught.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Woohoo! Haha!  Fire! Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: Is that everybody?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Yeah, that’s everyone.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: It better be.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Can’t you put this out?</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: I can’t lay down a layer thick enough! It’s
evaporating too fast!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Well, what’s that mean?</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: It means it’s hot! And I’m dehydrated,
Bob!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You’re out of ice? You can’t run out of ice! I
thought you can use water in the air!</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: There is no water in this air! What’s your
excuse, run out of muscle?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I just can’t go smashing into walls! The
building’s getting weaker by the second! It’s gonna come down on top of
us!</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: I wanted to go bowling!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: All right! Stay right on my tail! This is gonna
get hot!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Uh-oh.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Oh, good.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: Oh, now…that ain’t right!</p>
<p><strong>lucius/bob</strong>: - We look like bad guys! Incompetent bad

<p><strong>police officer</strong>: Freeze!</p>

I want you to…</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: I know. I know. Freeze.</p>

back at all…you’d be ‘’back later’’.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Well, I’m back, okay?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Is this rubble?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: It was just a little workout. Just to stay
loose.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: You know how I feel about that, Bob. Darn
you! We can’t blow cover again!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: The building was coming down anyway.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What?! You knocked down a building?!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: It was on fire. Structurally unsound. It was
coming down anyway.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Tell me you haven’t been listening to the
police scanner again?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Look, I performed a public service. You act
like that’s a bad thing.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: It is a bad thing, Bob! Uprooting our family
again, so you can relive the glory days is a very bad thing.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Reliving the glory days is better than acting
like they didn’t happen!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Yes! They happened! But this, our family, is
what’s happening now, Bob. And you are missing this! I can’t believe you
don’t want to go to your own son’s graduation.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: It’s not a graduation. He’s moving from the
fourth grade to the fifth grade.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: It’s a ceremony!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: It’s psychotic! They keep creating new ways to
celebrate mediocrity but if someone is genuinely exceptional…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: This is not about you, Bob. This is about
Dash.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You want to do something for Dash? Then let him
actually compete. Let him go out for sports!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I will not be made the enemy here! You know
why we can’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Because he’d be great!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: This is not about you!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: All right, Dash. I know you’re listening. Come
on out.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Vi? You, too, young lady.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Come on. Come on out. It’s okay, kids. We’re
just having a discussion.</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: Pretty loud discussion.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Yeah. But that’s okay. Because what’s important
is that Mommy and I are always a team. We’re always united against, uh,
the forces of, uh…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Pigheadedness?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I was gonna say evil or something.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: We’re sorry we woke you. Everything’s okay.
Go back to bed. It’s late.</p>

<p><strong>mr. huph</strong>: I’m not happy, Bob. Not happy. Ask me
why.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Okay. Why?</p>
<p><strong>mr. huph</strong>: Why what? Be specific, Bob.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Why are you unhappy?</p>
<p><strong>mr. huph</strong>: Your customers make me unhappy.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What, you’ve gotten complaints?</p>
<p><strong>mr. huph</strong>: Complaints I can handle. What I can’t
handle is your customers’ inexplicable knowledge of lnsuricare’s inner
workings! They’re experts. Experts, Bob! Exploiting every loophole,
dodging every obstacle! They’re penetrating the bureaucracy!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Did I do something illegal?</p>
<p><strong>mr. huph</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Are you saying we shouldn’t help our
customers?</p>
<p><strong>mr. huph</strong>: The law requires that I answer no.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: We’re supposed to help people.</p>
<p><strong>mr. huph</strong>: We’re supposed to help our people!
Starting with our stockholders, Bob. Who’s helping them out, huh? You
know, Bob, a company…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Is like an enormous clock.</p>
<p><strong>mr. huph</strong>: …is like an enormous clo–yes. Precisely.
It only works if all the little cogs mesh together. Now, a clock needs
to be cleaned, well-lubricated and wound tight. The best clocks have
jewel movements, cogs that fit, that cooperate by design. I’m being
metaphorical, Bob. You know what I mean by cooperative cogs? Bob? Bob?
Look at me when I’m talking to you, Parr!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: That man out there, he needs help.</p>
<p><strong>mr. huph</strong>: Do not change the subject, Bob. We’re
discussing your attitude!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: He is getting mugged!</p>
<p><strong>mr. huph</strong>: Well, let’s hope we don’t cover him.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>mr. huph</strong>: Stop right now or you’re fired! Close the
door. Get over here, now.</p>
<p><strong>mr. huph</strong>: I’m not happy, Bob. Not happy.</p>

<p><strong>rick</strong>: Nothing you haven’t said before.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Someone was in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Someone’s always in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I had to do something.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Yeah. Every time you say those words, it means
a month and a half of trouble for me, Bob. It means hundreds of
thousands of taxpayer’s dollars.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: We gotta pay to keep the company quiet. We
gotta pay damages, erase memories, relocate your family. Every time it
gets harder. Money, money, money, money. We can’t keep doing this, Bob!
We appreciate what you did in the old days, but those days are over.
From now on, you’re on your own.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Listen, Bob. Maybe I could relocate you, you
know, for old times’ sake.</p>

it had to take orders.</p>
<p><strong>mirage</strong>: We lost control. And now it’s loose in the
jungle, threatening our facility. We’ve had to evacuate all personnel
from the island for their own safety.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: How am I going in?</p>
<p><strong>mirage</strong>: The Omnidroid’s defenses necessitate an air
drop from 5000 feet. lts cloaking devices make it difficult to track.
Although we’re pretty sure it’s on the southern half of the island. One
more thing. Obviously it represents a significant investment.</p>

destroying it.</p>

Surely, you of all people understand that.</p>

settle down, why live…</p>

all.</p>

Prayge… Prague?</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: Milan, darling. Milan. Supermodels. Ha! Nothing
super about them. Spoiled, stupid, little stick figures with poofy lips
who think only about themselves. Feh! I used to design for gods. But
perhaps you come with a challenge, eh? I was surprised to get your
call.</p>

And you’ve torn right through it! What have you been doing, Robert?
Moonlighting hero work?</p>

<p><strong>e</strong>: I never look back, darling. It distracts from the

<p><strong>bob</strong>: A new suit? Where the heck am I gonna get a new
suit?</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: You can’t! It’s impossible! I’m far too busy. So
ask me now, before I again become sane.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Wait. You want to make me a suit?</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: You push too hard, darling! But I accept. It will
be bold. Dramatic!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: Heroic!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Yeah, something classic, like Dynaguy! Oh! He
had a great look! Oh, the cape and the boots…</p>

Nice man. Good with kids.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Listen, E…</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: November 15th of ’58. All was well, another day
saved when his cape snagged on a missile fin.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Thunderhead was not the brightest bulb…</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: Stratogale! April 23rd, ’57. Cape caught in a jet
turbine.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: E, you can’t generalize about these things.</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: Meta-man, express elevator. Dynaguy, snag on
takeoff. Splashdown, sucked into a vortex. No capes! Now, go on. Your
new suit will be finished before your next assignment.</p>

<p><strong>e</strong>: As am l, Robert. Yet, here we are.</p>

than those horrible pajamas he used to wear. They are finished. When are
you coming to see?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Look, I’m calling about…</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: Don’t make me beg, darling. I won’t do it, you
know.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Beg? Uh, no. I’m calling about suit. Ab-about
Bob’s suit! I’m calling about Bob’s suit!</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: You come in one hour, darling. I insist, okay?
Okay. Goodbye.</p>

<p><strong>syndrome</strong>: It’s bigger! It’s badder! Ladies and
gentlemen, it’s too much for Mr. lncredible! Whoa! Whoa! It’s finally
ready. You know, I went through quite a few supers to get it worthy to
fight you, but man, it wasn’t good enough! After you trashed the last
one, I had to make some major modifications. Sure it was difficult, but
you are worth it. I mean, after all…I am your biggest fan.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Buddy?</p>
<p><strong>syndrome</strong>: My name is not Buddy! And it’s not
lncrediBoy either! That ship has sailed. All I wanted was to help you. I
only wanted to help! And what did you say to me?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Fly home, Buddy. I work alone.</p>
<p><strong>syndrome</strong>: It tore me apart. But I learned an
important lesson. You can’t count on anyone. Especially your heroes.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I was wrong to treat you that way. I’m
sorry.</p>
<p><strong>syndrome</strong>: See? Now you respect me, because I’m a
threat. That’s the way it works. Turns out there’s a lot of people,
whole countries who want respect. And they will pay through the nose to
get it. How do you think I got rich? I invented weapons. And now I have
a weapon only I can defeat. And when I unleash it, I’ll get–</p>
<p><strong>syndrome</strong>: You sly dog! You got me monologuing. I
can’t believe it. It’s cool, huh? Zero-point energy. I save the best
inventions for myself. Am I good enough now? Who’s super now? I’m
Syndrome! Your nemesis and…</p>
<p><strong>syndrome</strong>: Oh, brilliant!</p>
<p><strong>syndrome</strong>: All right, try this one on for size, big
boy.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Gazerbeam.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: ‘’Kronos?’’</p>
<p><strong>probe</strong>: Life reading negative. Mr. Incredible
terminated.</p>

<p><strong>e</strong>: This project has completely confiscated my life,
darling. Consumed me as only hero work can. My best work, I must admit.
Simple, elegant, yet bold. You will die.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: E, I just…</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: I did Robert’s suit, and it turned out so
beautiful, I had to continue.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: E, It’s great to see you, but I gotta tell
you I have no idea what you’re talking about. I just…</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: Yes, words are useless. Gobble, gobble, gobble,
gobble, gobble! Too much of it, darling. Too much! That is why I show
you my work. That is why you are here.</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: Edna Mode. And guest.</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: Come. Sit.</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: Cream and sugar?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: I started with the baby.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Started?</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: Shh! Darling! Shh! I cut it a little roomy for
the free movement. The fabric is comfortable for sensitive skin, and can
also withstand a temperature of over 1000 degrees. Completely
bulletproof. And machine washable, darling. That’s a new feature.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What on earth do you think the baby will be
doing?!</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: Well, I’m sure I don’t know, darling. Luck favors
the prepared. I didn’t know the baby’s powers, so I covered the
basics.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Jack-Jack doesn’t have any powers.</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: No? Well, he’ll look fabulous anyway.</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: Your boy’s suit I designed to withstand enormous
friction without heating up or wearing out. A useful feature.</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: Your daughter’s suit was tricky. But I finally
created a sturdy material that will disappear completely as she
does.</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: Your suit can stretch as far as you can, without
injuring yourself, and still retain its shape. Virtually
indestructible…yet it breathes like Egyptian cotton. As an extra
feature, each suit contains a homing device, giving you the precise
global location of the wearer at the touch of a button. Well, darling?
What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What do I think? Bob is retired! I’m retired!
Our family is underground. You helped my husband resume secret hero work
behind my back?!</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: Well, I assumed you knew, darling. Why would he
keep secrets from you?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: He wouldn’t. Didn’t. Doesn’t.</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: Men at Robert’s age are often unstable. Prone to
weakness.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What are you saying?</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: Do you know where he is?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: Do you know where he is?</p>

<p><strong>guard 2</strong>: Come on, let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>guard 2</strong>: Are you okay? What happened?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh, hello. This is Helen Parr. Bob Parr is my
husband. I was wondering if you could give me the number of the hotel
he’s staying at? The number I have is no good.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Mr. Parr no longer works at Insuricare.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What do you mean? He’s on a business trip. A
company retreat.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: My records say his employment was terminated
almost two months ago.</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: So, you don’t know where he is. Would you like to
find out?</p>
<p><strong>__________________________________________scene</strong>:

know. The new sports car, the getting in shape, the blond hair, the
lies.</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: Yes, he attempts to relive the past.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Now I’m losing him! What’ll I do? What’ll I
do?</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Hmm?</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: You are Elastigirl! My God! Pull yourself
together! What will you do? Is this a question? Show him you remember
that he is Mr. lncredible, and you will remind him who you are! Well,
you know where he is. Go! Confront the problem! Fight! Win! And call me
when you get back, darling. I enjoy our visits.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: There’s lots of leftovers that you can
reheat. Make sure Dash does his homework. And both of you, get to bed on
time. I should be back tonight. Late. You can be in charge that long,
can’t you?</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: Yeah. But why am I in charge again?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Nothing. Just a little trouble with
Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: You mean Dad’s in trouble, or Dad is the
trouble?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I mean either he’s in trouble, or he’s going
to be.</p>
<p><strong>dash</strong>: Hey! What’s that? Where’d you get that, Mom?
You made a cool outfit? Hey, are those for us? We all get cool
outfits?</p>
<p><strong>dash</strong>: Ha-ha!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Dash! You come back here this moment!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Hey, Snug. Thanks for getting back. I know
this is short notice, but I was hoping that I could get you to…</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: What are these?</p>
<p><strong>dash</strong>: Look, I’m The Dash! The Dash likes.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Just a second. Take that off before somebody
sees it.</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: But you’re packing one just like it. Are you
hiding something?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh, please, honey. I’m on the phone…Dash!</p>
<p><strong>dash</strong>: Yikes! This is yours. It’s specially made.</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: You’re not coming! And I’ve gotta pack!</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: What makes you think it’s special?</p>
<p><strong>dash</strong>: I don’t know. Why’d Mom try to hide it?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Snug, I’m calling in a solid you owe me.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: A jet. What do you got that’s fast?</p>
<p><strong>snug</strong>: Let me think…</p>

requesting vectors to the initial. Over.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Easy, Helen. Easy. Easy, girl. You’re
overreacting. Everything’s fine. They’re just all getting coffee. At the
same time. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>syndrome</strong>: You sir, truly are ‘’Mr. lncredible’‘! You
know, I was right to idolize you. I always knew you were tough, but
tricking the probe by hiding under the bones of another super? Oh, man!
I’m still geeking out about it! And then you had to just go and ruin the
ride. I mean, Mr. lncredible calling for help?’‘Help me, help me.’’
Lame, lame, lame, lame, lame! All right, who did you contact?!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Contact? What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>syndrome</strong>: I am referring to last night at 2307 hours
while you were snooping around. You sent out a homing signal.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I didn’t know about the homing device.</p>
<p><strong>syndrome</strong>: And now a government plane is requesting
permission to land here! Who did you contact?!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I didn’t send for a plane.</p>
<p><strong>syndrome</strong>: Play the transmission.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: India golf niner-niner checking in. VFR on
top. Over.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Helen!</p>
<p><strong>syndrome</strong>: So you do know these people. Well, then,
I’ll send them a little greeting.</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: Ow!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Violet!</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: It’s not my fault! Dash ran away, and I knew
I’d get blamed for it–</p>
<p><strong>dash</strong>: That’s not true!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Dash?!</p>
<p><strong>violet/dash</strong>: - …and I thought he’d try to sneak on
the plane so I came here and you closed the doors before I could find
him and then you took off and it’s not my fault!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Wait a minute, wait a minute. You left
Jack-Jack alone?!</p>
<p><strong>violet/dash</strong>: - Yes, mom, I’m completely stupid…of
course we got a sitter! Do you think I’m totally irresponsible? Thanks a
lot!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: All right! Well, who’d you get?</p>
<p><strong>kari</strong>: You don’t have to worry about one single
thing, Mrs. Parr. I’ve got this baby-sitting thing wired. I’ve taken
courses and learned CPR and I got excellent marks and certificates…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Kari.</p>
<p><strong>kari</strong>: I also brought Mozart to play while he sleeps
to make him smarter because leading experts say Mozart makes babies
smarter.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Kari…</p>
<p><strong>kari</strong>: And the beauty part is that the babies don’t
even have to listen ’cause they’re asleep! You know, I wish my parents
played Mozart when I slept because half the time I don’t even know what
the heck anyone’s talking about.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Kari, I really don’t feel comfortable with
this. I’ll pay you for your trouble, but I’d really rather call a
service.</p>
<p><strong>kari</strong>: Oh, there’s really no need, Mrs. Parr. I can
totally handle anything this baby can dish out. Can’t I, little baby? I
can handle it. Who can handle it?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: India Golf niner-niner transmitting in the
blind guard. Disengage! Repeat, disengage!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Disengage! Repeat, disengage! Friendlies…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: No! Call off the missiles. I’ll do
anything!</p>
<p><strong>syndrome</strong>: Too late! Fifteen years too late.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Friendlies at two-zero miles south-southwest
of your position. Angels 10. Track east. Disengage! Vi! You have to put
a force field around the plane.</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: But you said we weren’t supposed to use our
powers.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I know what I said! Listen to what I’m saying
now!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Disengage. Repeat, disengage!</p>
<p><strong>dash</strong>: Mom?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Violet!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Mayday, mayday! India Golf niner-niner is
buddy-spiked! Abort! Abort! There are children aboard, say again, there
are children aboard!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Put a field around us now!</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: I’ve never done one that big!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Violet, do it now!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Abort, abort, abort!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Abort, abort, abort!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Brace yourselves!</p>
<p><strong>violet/dash</strong>: Mom! Mom!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Everybody calm down. Now, I’ll tell you what
we’re not gonna do. We’re not gonna panic, we’re not gonna–look out!</p>
<p><strong>dash/violet</strong>: - Oh, my God! Who’s idea was this
anyway?!</p>
<p><strong>dash</strong>: We’re dead! We’re dead!</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: It blew up!</p>
<p><strong>dash</strong>: We survived but we’re dead!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Stop it! We are not gonna die! Now both of
you will get a grip. Or so help me I will ground you for a month!
Understand?</p>
<p><strong>mirage</strong>: We have a confirmed hit. Target was
destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>syndrome</strong>: Ah, you’ll get over it. I seem to recall
you prefer to ‘’work alone’’.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Release me…now!</p>
<p><strong>syndrome</strong>: Or what?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I’ll crush her.</p>
<p><strong>syndrome</strong>: That sounds a little dark for you. Well,
go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: It’ll be easy. Like breaking a toothpick.</p>
<p><strong>syndrome</strong>: Show me.</p>
<p><strong>syndrome</strong>: I knew you couldn’t do it. Even when you
have nothing to lose. You’re weak. And I’ve outgrown you.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Those were short-range missiles. Land-based.
That way is our best bet.</p>
<p><strong>dash</strong>: You want to go toward the people that tried to
kill us?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: lf it means land, yes.</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: Do you expect us to swim there?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I expect you to trust me.</p>

<p><strong>violet</strong>: lf you haven’t noticed, mom, we’re not doing
so hot either.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I’m going to look for him. And that means
you’re in charge until I get back, Violet.</p>
<p><strong>dash</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: You heard her.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Put these on. Your identity is your most
valuable possession. Protect it. And if anything goes wrong, use your
powers.</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: But you said never to use…</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: I know what I said! Remember the bad guys on
those shows you used to watch on Saturday mornings? Well, these guys are
not like those guys. They won’t exercise restraint because you’re
children. They will kill you if they get the chance. Do not give them
that chance.</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: Mom?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Vi, I’m counting on you.</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: There’s something I…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I’m counting on you. Be strong. Dash, if
anything goes wrong, I want you to run as fast as you can.</p>
<p><strong>dash</strong>: As fast as I can?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: As fast as you can. Stay hidden. Keep each
other safe. I’ll be back by morning.</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: Mom! Mom, what happened on the plane. I’m
sorry. I wanted to help. I mean, when you asked me to… I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Shh. It isn’t your fault. It wasn’t fair for
me to suddenly ask so much of you. But things are different now. And
doubt is a luxury we can’t afford anymore, sweetie. You have more power
than you realize. Don’t think. And don’t worry. lf the time comes,
you’ll know what to do. It’s in your blood.</p>

<p><strong>syndrome</strong>: Oh, hey. Look, look…if you’re talking
about what happened in the containment unit, I had everything under
control.</p>
<p><strong>mirage</strong>: And disregarding it is not strength.</p>

all. I knew he wouldn’t have it in him to actually…</p>

<p><strong>guard</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>dash</strong>: Well, not that this isn’t fun, but I’m gonna
go look around.</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: What do you think is going on here? You
think we’re on vacation or something? Mom and Dad’s lives could be in
jeopardy. Or worse, their marriage.</p>
<p><strong>dash</strong>: Their marriage? So, the bad guys are trying to
wreck Mom and Dad’s marriage.</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: Oh, forget it. You’re so immature.</p>

And I did it without your precious gifts, your oh-so-special powers.
I’ll give them heroics. I’ll give them the most spectacular heroics

And when everyone’s super…no one will be.</p>

<p><strong>lucius</strong>: I need it!</p>
<p><strong>honey</strong>: Uh-uh! Don’t you think about running off
doing no derrin’-do! We’ve been planning this dinner for two months!</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: The public is in danger!</p>
<p><strong>honey</strong>: My evening’s in danger!</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: You tell me where my suit is, woman! We are
talking about the greater good!</p>
<p><strong>honey</strong>: ‘’Greater good’’? I am your wife! I’m the
greatest good you are ever gonna get!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Run!</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: My baby!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: The supers have returned!</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Is that Fironic?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Fironic?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: No, Fironic has a different outfit.</p>
<p><strong>syndrome</strong>: No, no, I’m a new superhero! I’m
Syndrome!</p>
<p><strong>syndrome</strong>: All right, stand back.</p>
<p><strong>syndrome</strong>: Someone needs to teach this hunk of metal
a few manners.</p>
<p><strong>syndrome</strong>: Ha, ha!</p>
<p><strong>dash</strong>: Are we there yet?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: We get there when we get there.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: How you doing, honey?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Do I have to answer?!</p>

<p><strong>bob</strong>: Ready, Violet? Ready? Now!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: This is gonna be rough!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: The robot’s in the financial district. Which
exit do I take?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Traction Avenue.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: That’ll take me downtown. I take Seventh, don’t
I?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Don’t take Seventh!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Great, we missed it!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: You asked me how to get there and I told you.
Exit at Traction!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: That’ll take me downtown!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: He’s coming up! Get in the right lane!
Signal!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Not Traction!</p>

<p><strong>bob</strong>: Is everybody okay back there?</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: Super-duper, Dad!</p>
<p><strong>dash</strong>: Let’s do that again.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Wait here and stay hidden. I’m going in.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: While what? I watch helplessly from the
sidelines? I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I’m asking you to wait with the kids.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: And I’m telling you not a chance. You’re my
husband. I’m with you for better or worse.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I have to do this alone.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What is this to you? Playtime?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: So you can be Mr. lncredible again?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Then what? What is it?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I’m not…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Not what?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I’m not strong enough.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Strong enough. And this will make you
stronger?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Yes. No!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: That’s what this is? Some sort of
workout?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I can’t lose you again!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I can’t. Not again. I’m not… strong enough.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: lf we work together, you won’t have to
be.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I don’t know what’ll happen.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Hey. We’re superheroes. What can happen?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Vi! Dash! No!</p>
<p><strong>dash</strong>: Violet?</p>
<p><strong>dash</strong>: Dad!</p>

<p><strong>lucius</strong>: Dash! Gotcha!</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: Mom, I’ve got it! I’ve got the remote!</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: A remote? A remote that controls what? The
robot?</p>
<p><strong>dash</strong>: It’s coming back!</p>
<p><strong>dash</strong>: That wasn’t right.</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: Give me that!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: We can’t stop it. The only thing hard enough to
penetrate it is…itself.</p>
<p><strong>dash</strong>: It’s getting closer!</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: It doesn’t work!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Kids!</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: It’s not doing anything!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Lucius, try to buy us some time!</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: Try the one next to it!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Honey!</p>

<p><strong>bob</strong>: No, the other one! The first one!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: First button! Got it!</p>
<p><strong>dash</strong>: It’s getting closer!</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: Look out!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Get out of here, kids! Find a safe spot!</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: We’re not going anywhere!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Press the button!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Not yet!</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: Hang on!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What are you waiting for?!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: A closer target! You got one shot!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Everybody duck!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Hey, Zone.</p>
<p><strong>syndrome</strong>: Huh? No!</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Hey, did you see that? Eh? That’s the way
to do it. That’s old school.</p>
<p><strong>old man 2</strong>: Yeah. No school like the old school.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: Just like old times.</p>

even sneezes, we’ll be there with a hanky and a pair of handcuffs. The
people of this country are indebted to you.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Does this mean we can come out of hiding?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Let the politicians figure that one out. But
I’ve been asked to assure you we’ll take care of everything else. You
did good, Bob.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Come on. We’re in a limo.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Hey, you’re wearing your hair back?</p>

<p><strong>dash</strong>: That was so cool when you threw that car!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Not as cool as you running on water!</p>
<p><strong>dash</strong>: Hey, mom! That was sweet when you snagged that
bad guy with your arm and kinda whiplashed him into the other guy. It

<p><strong>rick</strong>: Here we are.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Replacement? I didn’t call a replacement.</p>
<p><strong>syndrome</strong>: Shh. The baby is sleeping. You took away
my future. I’m simply returning the favor. Oh, don’t worry, I’ll be a
good mentor. Supportive, encouraging. Everything you weren’t. And in
time, who knows, he might make a good sidekick. Ha ha!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: He’s getting away, Bob! We have to do
something! We have to do something now!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Something’s happening. What’s happening?!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: We have to stop him! Throw something!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I can’t! I might hit Jack-Jack!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Throw me.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Bob, throw me!</p>
<p><strong>syndrome</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>syndrome</strong>: This isn’t the end of it! I will get your
son, eventually. I’ll get your son!</p>
<p><strong>syndrome</strong>: Oh, no.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Look at Mommy, honey. Don’t look down.
Mommy’s got you. Everything is all right.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: That’s my girl.</p>
<p><strong>dash</strong>: Does this mean we have to move again?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Oh, man. That was totally wicked!</p>
