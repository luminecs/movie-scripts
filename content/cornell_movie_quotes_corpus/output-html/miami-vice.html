<p><strong>nicholas</strong>: Burnett, what’s crackin’?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Maxin’ and relaxin’.</p>
<p><strong>nicholas</strong>: Sure. Change your mind; get inclined? Let
me know…</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: What’s our deal?</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Backup in case the Russians get physical.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: How lucky’s Miss Universe gotta be?</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Skin has to touch skin. That’s the
requirement for the warrant. Then he makes a credible excuse and he
stops…. Her crew blackmailed and asset- stripped the last mark down to
his social security…</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: This I gotta see… …the “make up an excuse and
stop” part.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Have faith.</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: I have faith. In horoscopes and fortune
cookies…</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: Switek pulling this off…? That’s not faith;
that’s delusional…</p>
<p><strong>aerial</strong>: THE SIKORSKI crosses past the stacks of $5
million condos to a landing pad on a roof. The Miami of the ’80’s, that
twilight-zone frontier built on coke-fueled cash flow, is over. The
frontier development stage is passed. It has BECOME Casablanca. Anything
goes; everything has a price.</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Damn, girl…</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: This is exciting…</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: That’s ’cause nothing is happening.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: No shit…?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Yeah. This is their surveillance…how they
video their marks? See, we jacked their fiber optics, like we
piggybacked their signal. Get it?</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Cooool…</p>
<p><strong>ugo</strong>: Runnin’ the Biscayne 200?</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: If a coupla new exhaust manifolds show
up…</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Gin and Tonic. Plymouth or Boodles.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Lemon or lime?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Lemon doesn’t go in Gin and Tonics,
darlin’. Where ya’ from?</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Gottingen. That’s in Sweden.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: You in Miami workin’ on your
complexion…?</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: No. I was in Namibia…</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Doing…?</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: With the United Nations High Commission
on Refugees. Famine relief.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Really? I did refugee relocation in
Somalia. But they transferred me out after I was wounded…</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: Only African he ever “relocated” was a
$2,000-an-hour Nigerian model for Gucci, and he got wounded when she
took an NBA draft choice to the Super Bowl instead of him…</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: He did volunteer one time…</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: For a massage parlor bust? Why am I
here…?</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: …to backup Switek. But only if it gets
lethal.</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: That’s impossible.</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: Because you cannot kill him.</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: And there’s Dmitri…</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: The honey trap. And there’s the honey.</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Hello, Miss Ukraine…</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: Eleven to seven he blows it.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Twenty on my man…</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: You’re giving away your money, fool…</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: You bet your partner?</p>
<p><strong>zito</strong>: Sure. Switek versus primal impulse from the
amygdala. Higher thinking versus the lizard brain. Tectonic plates of
libido confront the cognitive.</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: Oh, bullshit. She cops his joint. He pushes
the button.</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: What’s so fucking difficult?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Yeah…?</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: Sonny…?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: Where’s Riccardo?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: On the phone.</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: I’m sorry. I’m sorry, Sonny…</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: It’s fucked up. I’m sorry…</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Alonzo? What are you talking about? Where
are you…?</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: They had me from the gate.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: I don’t understand…</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: I gave up nothing on you guys. Don’t worry.
I kept you and Rico out of it. Only the Feds. They’re on their own…it’s
all their deal, anyway, so fuck ’em.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Alonzo, what’s goin’ on?!</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: After I check on Francine and the boys,
then I’m gone. Sonny, tell Rico I’m so sorry. I wanted you to know…</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: …look after her. Ask Rico to. Okay? Do that
for me. I had to do it. They had me from the gate. Do that. Whatever you
can do for them. Okay? Look what I did to them, Sonny…!</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Alonzo…!</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Alonzo…</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Stevens?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Something’s wrong.</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: I’ll try Francine…</p>
<p><strong>machine voice</strong>: Federal Bureau of Investigation. Our
office hours are…</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: This is Detective Crockett. Miami- Dade
P.D. Patch me through to your Special Agent in Charge, James Fujima?
It’s an emergency…</p>
<p><strong>fbi agent</strong>: He’ll be in on Monday…</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: I said, “emergency.” If he’s not
reachable, who’s running the weekend? The ASAC?</p>
<p><strong>fbi agent</strong>: We don’t give that out…</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Listen carefully.</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: C’mon…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Miami-Dade PD Tech…</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Bobby G. The firefly we used to have on
Alonzo Stevens’ Bentley, check if it still runs; if so, launch Air
Support. Locate the Bentley… I don’t know…we haven’t worked with him for
six months…</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>fujima</strong>: This is Agent James Fujima.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Detective Crockett.</p>
<p><strong>fujima</strong>: What’s your Miami PD badge number?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: 4-4-7 Charlie 12-92.</p>
<p><strong>fujima</strong>: Okay. What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: A C.I. we cut loose to your Joint
Interagency Task Force. Name of Alonzo Stevens. Now, he’s YOUR
informant. Stevens, called us. I haven’t spoken to him for six months. I
do not know what case you have him on. I do not know what he is talking
about. But whatever he is doing for you, it sounds like it is going bad.
Right now…</p>
<p><strong>fujima</strong>: How do I discuss operations over an open
line?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: How do I know? I got the call from Alonzo
on an open line. That is the hand we have been dealt at this moment, at
eleven-forty-seven o’clock Friday night. Okay? I am trying to alert you,
here. You know whether or not…you have a thing goin’ down. I do not. But
we know this guy. I think you know this guy. Normally, he is cool.
Tonight he is distraught. That is atypical. That engenders foreboding.
Do you understand the meaning of the word “foreboding”? As in badness is
happening to your deal right fucking now?</p>
<p><strong>fujima</strong>: Guy’s involved in a “meet”…</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: “Buy and walk”? “Buy and bust”? “Reverse
undercover”? What?</p>
<p><strong>fujima</strong>: Meet and greet. “I flash you some of mine,
you flash me some of yours?”</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: And the deal goes down at another place at
another time.</p>
<p><strong>fujima</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: …so there’s no industrial- strength HRT
weapons team out there tonight?</p>
<p><strong>fujima</strong>: Correct. Flash samples. Flash cash.</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Haitian, Dominican, Russian, Israeli?</p>
<p><strong>fujima</strong>: White supremacist types.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: OMGs, Mongols, Nazi Low-Riders, prison
gangs?</p>
<p><strong>fujima</strong>: NLR, we think. I wanna know…</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Oh, good…</p>
<p><strong>fujima</strong>: …what else, what else did he indicate to
you? I need to know everything he said.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: He is saying they had him from the gate.
He is saying to my partner and I and to his family “goodbye.” What does
that tell you?</p>
<p><strong>switek</strong>: Sonny, we got him…</p>
<p><strong>closer</strong>: ARYAN BROTHERS. Friendly. Hip-hop culture
has invaded White Supremacist gangs. Buzz cuts. Goatees. A couple of
diamond earrings.</p>
<p><strong>russian #1</strong>: …sample now is okay. And we want sample
load when we do deal…</p>
<p><strong>aryan brother</strong>: Sure, man.</p>
<p><strong>russian #1</strong>: What inventory you can supply…?</p>
<p><strong>aryan brother #1</strong>: Meth. Glass, ice, K’s, E’s,
Mitsu’s, Ames, Ex…whatever you need. Coke? Tonnage. And Colombian H. But
give us a heads up…</p>
<p><strong>aryan brother #2</strong>: Yeah… Now, let’s see the
green…</p>
<p><strong>russian</strong>: Never seen money before? This is called
“money.”</p>
<p><strong>aryan brother #1</strong>: Okay. You got lotsa green. We got
all the goodies. We party. Larry’ll call you in the AM and talk money,
quantity, time and place…</p>
<p><strong>aryan brother</strong>: Hey, Ivan! I forgot to ask you
something, my brother…</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: What the hell did you do?</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: The Feeb gig was I front a coupla
undercover, Russian-speakers to them. One’s ATF. And broker the deal.
Set up the meet with the NLR types…</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: How’d they get onto you?</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: How do I know? But it was from the get-go.
Knew the FBI had run me into them. Sonny, I gotta go…!</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: Hello, Sonny…?</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: I gotta, I gotta go…!</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Alonzo…</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: What…?</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Alonzo, you don’t need to go home.</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: They said they wouldn’t hurt them, wouldn’t
hurt them if…</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: They lied.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: They been known to do that…</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>castillo</strong>: What’s your twenty?</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Quarter mile away. We see the lights…</p>
<p><strong>castillo</strong>: Turn around.</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: We know these people…!</p>
<p><strong>castillo</strong>: Grieve elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>fujima</strong>: We’re not certain…</p>
<p><strong>castillo</strong>: You said Nazi Low-riders…?</p>
<p><strong>fujima</strong>: We’re not certain!</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: C’mon, man!</p>
<p><strong>fujima</strong>: We think NLR. We don’t know! Alonzo only
fronted as a broker for our guys to make the meet. He wasn’t deep into
the crew.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: White gangs…? It doesn’t track.</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: White gangs is tweakers and a crystal meth
lab in a trailer park. Bounce around the old lady Saturday night and get
your recidivist ass busted back…</p>
<p><strong>fujima</strong>: Not anymore. This is a distribution network
out of South Florida, moving poly-drug loads, crystal meth through coke,
to Nashville, Atlanta, Memphis, Cleveland. And computer fraud, identity
theft. It’s like that.</p>
<p><strong>castillo</strong>: Tell them what you want.</p>
<p><strong>fujima</strong>: They knew about Alonzo, before he made a
move on them. They had our operation. They’ve cut into us.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>fujima</strong>: We don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Break your encryption? Hack your e- mail?
Employee databases? Somebody on the inside?</p>
<p><strong>fujima</strong>: We don’t know. And that’s the point. Maybe
there’s a mole. Whatever, it’s a disaster. And it’s a Joint Interagency
Task Force. I have DEA, ATF, U.S. Customs components in on it. So the
penetration could be from any one agency. What we do know is I have to
suspend operations right now from undercover work through interdictions
’cause I have to assume our Operational Security is blown.</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: As in, your ass is dead in the water.</p>
<p><strong>fujima</strong>: But Miami PD wasn’t part of the J.I.T. And
from what Alonzo said, he didn’t give you up.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: So what do you want?</p>
<p><strong>fujima</strong>: To recruit you.</p>
<p><strong>castillo</strong>: …I didn’t want you around the crime scene
because it’s crawling with federal law enforcement. We don’t know who’s
straight up, who’s not…</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Recruit us to do what?</p>
<p><strong>fujima</strong>: Get into business with this crew, identify
them. Illuminate their network. If you’re lucky, discover their source,
how they penetrated us. We’ll indict and take it from there…</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: How do we do that? Make a buy? That went
well…</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Reverse undercover? WE supply to them?</p>
<p><strong>fujima</strong>: They got a steady stream of supply. So,
no…</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: From whom…?</p>
<p><strong>fujima</strong>: A Colombian producer. Named Archangel de
Jesus Montoya-Londono.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Never heard of him.</p>
<p><strong>fujima</strong>: From the North Valle area. New. Low-level,
we think.</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Aryan brothers are not going to change-up
suppliers. So…</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Transpo? How they bringing the loads
in…?</p>
<p><strong>fujima</strong>: They’re not. They collect in Miami. Montoya,
the producer, handles deliveries. That’s his end, and he varies the
routes. We got some FLIR off an AWAC of a coupla go-fast boats, on one
run, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Track with me, here… They knew the “Russians”
were undercover Feeb? They should have no-showed. But, no, these guys
show anyway, and commit murder upon federal officers. And steal all your
money… What does that say to you?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: It says, “We do not fear you.” It says,
“Fuck off and die.” It says, “We get down for recreation…”</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: We could try to run loads into these guys.
Run a few loads for Montoya into South Florida. Into this group.</p>
<p><strong>fujima</strong>: You need to consider a few issues.</p>
<p><strong>castillo</strong>: …you’d be operating outside territorial
United States. Your badges do not count. You have no authorization to
carry weapons. If you’re busted, it could take a long time to get you
re-patriated. And there’s no backup… And you will share with them all
your intel on Montoya…</p>
<p><strong>fujima</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>castillo</strong>: I mean full disclosure.</p>
<p><strong>fujima</strong>: Of course. From my side, I don’t WANT to
know anything about what you’re doing or how you do it… So let me know
if we’re on…</p>
<p><strong>castillo</strong>: About the Stevens family, I’m sorry. I
know you were close to them.</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: I was the kids’ godfather.</p>
<p><strong>castillo</strong>: And…?</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: “And” what?</p>
<p><strong>castillo</strong>: I got to know. There is never any room for
“personal”…</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: He is fine. And we know the jokes. When it
gets vengeful, things get messy. When they get messy the wrong people
die… Everybody gets it.</p>
<p><strong>castillo</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: And the answer is “yes.” Before she met
Alonzo, once upon a time, a long time ago. You bet it was personal.</p>
<p><strong>castillo</strong>: Okay. What’d you spot…?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Three wakes off the back of those boats.
Who runs three Sterling engines off a deep-V hull?</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Sal Maguda.</p>
<p><strong>castillo</strong>: He any good?</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Oh, yeah…</p>
<p><strong>castillo</strong>: So what’s gonna persuade Montoya to change
off Sal Maguda running his deliveries…?</p>
<p><strong>bastide</strong>: Odile, she say they’re pregnant…</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Yeah? Okay. Only Jean-Louis and I do the
talking…</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Comme on dit…</p>
<p><strong>jean-louis</strong>: Charger et les recoit d’ici…</p>
<p><strong>bad guy</strong>: You crazy? Que fais-tu?</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Que faisons-nous? De qu’a-t-il l’air, fou!
Nous voulons tous votre drugs. like we’re doing, fool? We are</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Hey, Sailor… Yeah, I’m good. Got a hole in
the calendar…looking to charge up the cash flow. Yeah, later.</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Hey, Nicholas, my ace. Wha’s up?</p>
<p><strong>nicholas</strong>: You know. Same old…</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: We got idle all of an instant. You got
something from somewhere that’s got to go someplace, somewhen, which is
not too distantly in the future…?</p>
<p><strong>nicholas</strong>: It is fortuitous that you called…</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: We’re from Nicholas to meet Jos�…</p>
<p><strong>jos� yero</strong>: Jos�…</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Sonny Burnett…this is my partner,
Rico.</p>
<p><strong>jos� yero</strong>: Sit.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Dos caf�.</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: So lay it out, my brother…</p>
<p><strong>jos� yero</strong>: Nicholas said you okay. That’s nice. But
how I know if you any good?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: What…?</p>
<p><strong>jos� yero</strong>: Who you run loads for? Cause other than
Nicholas, you knows you?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: My mommy and daddy know me.</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: And we didn’t come down here to audition.
Business auditions for us… …and know who we are and know they want their
load run by us before Nicholas calls.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: That way we do not waste AvGas or our
motherfucking time.</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: You wearing a wire?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Or DEA? The Feeb?</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: People gonna walk into this place and say,
“Ola, hijo! That some crazy wallpaper. Whew…it wild! Is that a Jackson
Pollack?”</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: “No, viejo. That was Jos� Yero, splattered
all over his motherfucking wall.”</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: So we can close each other’s eyes right now.
Real easy. Real fast. But, then, nobody makes any money…</p>
<p><strong>jos� yero</strong>: Equipment?</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Slow and low, Adam A-500s… …carbon composite,
stealthy, 1400 nautical-mile range, thousand ki payload…all the way to
Caravels and 727’s from a source country to a transshipment point. Small
freighters. We’ve done containers…</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: And specialize in very fast go-fast boats
for coastal runs.</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: What kind of weight?</p>
<p><strong>jos� yero</strong>: We don’t talk weight. We talk
logistics.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: The people on shore who handle a load we
run are our people, not your people. No tweakers, dopers, first- timers
we don’t know. They didn’t do time with us, they ain’t doing crime with
us.</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: What you get from us is a date. A place. “In
the parking lot of a Jack-in-the-Box in north Miami.” At such-and-such
time, an eighteen- wheeler will be there. Keys in the ignition. Ready to
roll. You pick it up. And you drive it… …away.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Money thing is done in advance in places
where there are no guns. Because when money and guns get together, there
is violence…</p>
<p><strong>jos� yero</strong>: You afraid of violence?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: I am not John Wayne. There is no “S” on
his chest. We get down if the play calls for it. But we are into
business and making money.</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: And violence is extra. And expensive. So how
much weight you looking to move?</p>
<p><strong>jos� yero</strong>: Nothing. ’Cause how you do delivery on
the beach, I don’t like. Maybe this does not work.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Then it don’t work.</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: What happened to the last transporter you
had?</p>
<p><strong>jos� yero</strong>: What do you care?</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Do we need this…?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Red light, green light, Jos�?</p>
<p><strong>jos� yero</strong>: I’m also called “Cochi Loco.” That means
“Crazy pig.” ’Cause I enforce security and get people to tell me what I
need to know. That part of what I do, you never want to find out about.
Other people will negotiate the money and go or not go. Not me…</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Then what were we talking to you for?</p>
<p><strong>jos� yero</strong>: I had to lay eyes on you.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: And…?</p>
<p><strong>jos� yero</strong>: You seem okay. But him? I don’t like… how
he looks…</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: What do I care what you think about how he
looks? You wanna fuck my partner or do business?</p>
<p><strong>jos� yero</strong>: Wait by the phone. You get a call. Or
maybe you don’t. Until then, piss off back to where you come from…</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: …Sonny can wait.</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Anything?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: “Hi, Gina. Hi, Sonny.”</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Hi, Gina. This is from Frick and Frack.
Trudy?</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: What do we got?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Satellite. New encryption. Supposedly
sharper than the G… How good’s our background?</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: You’re so not the PD, if you got busted on a
DUI, you’re in serious trouble…you’re bad men back to grammar school.
San Quentin. Pelican Bay. Marine Corps. Statesville. Pelican Bay, where
you guys hooked up. Now you’re too smart and too fast to get jacked
again…</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: How will it stand up?</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: If they ran the rental car or lease on this
place…even if it’s EPIC database in El Paso…they’d have to work through
the layers of bullshit three weeks deep. Then they’d find your deeper,
hidden criminal selves…</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: What am I supposed to do after I get my nails
and hair done…?</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Reality TV and stay by the phone. That’s what
all wives-in-crime do…</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: Be…careful… You hear me?</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Where we meeting ’em…?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Port-Au-Prince.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: What do we got?</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Five minutes…</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: They watching us watching them watching us
waiting for them? Or what?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Who knows…</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: Put your guns on the table… If we wanted
you dead, you would no longer be drawing breath in Miami. We wouldn’t
have brought you all the way here.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Really? So, what is this, a party?</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: We’ll have room service wipe up the
furniture…and bring drinks.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Glad we came. This place is a lot of fun
if you’re Doctors Without Borders. So…?</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: I run down the numbers. Nothing is very
negotiable. Small loads? We pay three thousand a ki. We pay your fuel
costs up front plus ten percent. The next ten percent on U.S.
landfall.</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Define small.</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: Two, three thousand a ki. Two thousand
ki’s, your end is $6,000,000. Complex transshipments or dealing with
containers, these have front- loaded costs we pickup. For this kind of
weight, the balance of 80% is when our buyer picks up the load.
Transactions are offshore. Dollars or euros. Secure internet transfers.
We have lists of Cayman and Isle of Man banks infiltrated by IRS, to be
avoided… No transactions of cash or other banking instruments take place
on U.S. soil… That’s the deal.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: I thought we had to meet the Man.</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: You do.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: Right now.</p>
<p><strong>montoya</strong>: Please take that seat on the side…</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>montoya</strong>: Excuse me because I am very busy and have
many things to do, so this will be brief. Yes? We will try you on a
“run.” One. To build trust. We do a thousand kis. In all matters, when
you work for us, you must do exactly what you say you will do. In this
business with me, if you say you will do a thing, you must do exactly
that thing. Then? You will prosper beyond your dreams and you can live
in Miami in millionaire style. If you are arrested, there will be
lawyers made available to you in the United States. You will use them.
Anything you need, you will be provided by me. It cost you nothing. You
will contact and work through Jos� Yero on logistics and communications.
To do with money, you will work through my wife, Isabella…</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: …who did we just meet?</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: Hello…?</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: You sure?</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: Yes. What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Nothing. Calling to say hi… What’s up with
you?</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: Bored.</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Okay…see you soon.</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: …and thanks for the flowers.</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: What flowers?</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: The bouquet, here. Five-hundred dollars worth
of roses…yellow.</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: There a note?</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: You mean with the flowers…?</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: What’s it say?</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: “Salutations from the south…”</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: We’re on our way…</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: So why don’t you…meet the plane…</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Good idea. We’ll grab a bite.</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: …the lease, the phones, the cars…layers of
false ident. Would take the FBI weeks. How long did it take them? Three
hours? Four? This means, “We can reach out and touch somebody.” Like Bad
Teleflora.</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: …even if they could run the identities you
built to EPIC, all they’ll find is more cover… Trust what you built.
It’s quality, girl. We’re cool…</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: …you are trying to reassure me because you
know when people get anxious, they make mistakes. You’re worried about
me. Do not be. I am careful. I am cool. I got Trudy, backup, whatever.
You worry about you. Because you are the ones who are in denied
territory, not me. If your focus is on me, you’ll miss something coming
at you. That’s how people slip up. Get hurt. And I’d die if anything
happened. You worry about you. You and Sonny…are in the dangerous place.
I’m fine…</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: We set.</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: To the limit.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: You worried about the tree line, US
Customs AWACS, or something else on your mind?</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Like…?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Gina in the Miami pad. You gonna give me
phony denials?</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: No. You gonna give me phony reassurances?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Good. So let’s go…</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Transglobal Airlines flight zero-
zero-zero…is in the air…</p>
<p><strong>zito</strong>: Roger that.</p>
<p><strong>air traffic controller</strong>: Eleven-ten, Sierra, do you
have a visual on another aircraft…?</p>
<p><strong>zito</strong>: Negative, Opa-Locka.</p>
<p><strong>air traffic controller</strong>: Opa-Locka Air Traffic
Control to JIT 0-seven-six-Nellie-Charlie…</p>
<p><strong>awac</strong>: Hello, Opa-Locka. What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>air traffic controller</strong>: I’ve got an Aero Commander
coming in on a two-seventy-nine heading, but I had a double image…like
there’s another plane there, now I’m only picking up on one. What do you
read?</p>
<p><strong>radar officer</strong>: Let me see…</p>
<p><strong>awac radar officer</strong>: Too many Mai Tais at lunch…
You’re seeing double. One blip. One plane.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Neptune gonna show?</p>
<p><strong>jean-louis</strong>: Oh, he’ll show. This is his kind of
deal. Crime on crime. Who’s gonna call the cops?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Usually his thing is street dealers.
Torture their families until they cough up the stash. This…?</p>
<p><strong>jean-louis</strong>: He’s ambitious.</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Heads up…</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Here’s another incognito genius…</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: April Fool, motherfucker.</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Arrete! Arrete! Freeze! Et vous, mo-fo!</p>
<p><strong>jean-louis</strong>: Get the fuck in the truck…!</p>
<p><strong>jos� yero</strong>: Client got delivery. But there
were…“extras” in the back of the truck.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: “Extras” tried to relieve us of your
weight… And by the by, you know of a player in Overtown who goes by the
name of “Things Aquatic”?</p>
<p><strong>jos� yero</strong>: I do. We don’t do business with him…</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: He tried to…“do business”…with you. Around
ten. His place. Be there.</p>
<p><strong>jos� yero</strong>: I’ll be there.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Look familiar?</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: This the load you lost a while back?</p>
<p><strong>jos� yero</strong>: It is. He try to take tonight’s load?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>jos� yero</strong>: And what do I do with him?</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Whatever you want. Like we said, we’re not
into violence.</p>
<p><strong>jos� yero</strong>: I walk into Neptune’s house…very nice.
But I also see you… and our drugs that got ripped from Maguda.</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: You don’t like us finding your load? We can
go and lose it all over again…</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: How ’bout this? How’d Neptune know where
to hit us? Huh? Whose Op sec’s got a leak? Yours?</p>
<p><strong>jos� yero</strong>: What’d Neptune tell you?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: He didn’t. Interrogation’s not in our
skill set. So c’mon, what suspicions have you master-minded off these
associations?</p>
<p><strong>jos� yero</strong>: Here’s what this is…ask how much they
want to turn back to us our load…</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: We want it back.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: What’s the recovery? How much are you
looking for?</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: How much we looking for?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: What’s “nothing”?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Nothing. As in “free, gratis.”</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: And as an investment in the future…</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: “Future” of…?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: A fine…business…relationship…</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: It’s yours cause what’s yours, is yours. And
what’s ours is ours… …like the second ten-percent, which is now due,
Yero, my ace.</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: Give them the shipment on the
seventeenth…</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Conveyance?</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: Maritime. Jose will fill you in.</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Lay it out…</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: There is one thing you can do for me in
recognition of the death- defying risks we took to recover your
product…</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: And what is that?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Let me buy you a drink.</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: What do you like to drink?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: I’m a fiend for mojitas.</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: How fast does that go?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: It goes very fast.</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: Show me…?</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Can I talk to you for a second, partner…?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: I know what I’m doing.</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: …secure satellite comms. encrypted e-mail,
the longs and lats for the transshipment point…all that? It’s all cool.
But I need a vector, not a location. ’Cause ships move. That’s why they
call them ships. Ship stops? It’s trying to be an apartment building. At
sea that attracts attention. That’s bad…</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: So where’s the best place for mojitas?</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: Bodeguita del Medio. It’s the only place
for mojitas…</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Where’s that?</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: Off a little alley with cobblestones.
Hemingway went there…</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: The Keys?</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: Havana.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Havana? Cubans don’t like us or my
business…</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: Are you afraid? Good. And you don’t need a
visa. Cause you’re with me.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Light touch. Everything comes to you
through the wheel.</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: My cousin is the harbor master. You must
not bring in drugs. You cannot be armed. If you’re carrying, it has to
go. Or stow it inside. No one will go near your boat…</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: You do business in Cuba with your
husband?</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: I never do business in Cuba. And nobody
goes to Cuba but me. And he is not my husband…</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Were you born in Havana?</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: Angola. My mother was being a surgeon
there. She volunteered. Mozambique and Mali, too… …those days, in those
days…she was part of Cuba’s gift to the third world. She came from a
bourgeois family with a house in Verdado…we still have the house. We
will go there…</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Where’s she now?</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: She’s dead…</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Your father?</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: Angolan Military. Went back to the
fighting. Disappeared. Who knows…?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: How’s he not your husband?</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: I am no one’s wife. I live in my own
house. I do not live in a man’s house. He has a wife. We are together. I
am free. Because of banking and finance and travel… And I can do
anything I want…</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Mojitas…?</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: Later! Do you dance?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: I dance…</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: My aunt. She’s ancient. She looks after
the place… This was my mother’s family’s home…</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: Tell me everything.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: I insist.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Okay. Macon, Georgia is where I was born.
Wound up in a juvenile facility. I was 14. Then the military. Then
prison. Because I was dumb and angry. Then I read. Then I got smart.
Then I discovered what I know, now…it’s all business…</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: Blanca…a rubio like you. I see her in a
dress…an old photograph from Lucinda somebody’s wedding…everybody is
with couples. Husbands and wives. They all pose. My mother is alone
because my father had to go back to the fighting. …she looks right into
the camera. She is the most beautiful woman in the room. By herself. In
a party dress. And she looked like she knew she would die alone… She
spoke many languages. We were in Luanda when she died. I went to her
friends in Mali. They sent me to the Ecole Polytechnique in Geneva to
study mathematics, where I met Montoya in the discos. He had banking
there…I was seventeen and very much into the clubs. And he sent me to
University for an MBA in Finance. Your mother?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Died in childbirth, having me…</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: To mothers. And all that we owe them…</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: You know how improbable this is…?</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: “Probable”…applies to an event that may be
real. Doesn’t apply here.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: …’cause we have no future…are of today and
not tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: …and therafore there is no
consequence?</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Let’s talk deliveries.</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: Like…?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Like “three thousand a ki?” That’s nice.
And I can supply the transportation into South Florida and the Gulf,
more reliable and on-time than FedEx. But, three per ki was OK for
openers.</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: And why should continuing excellence cost
more?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Cost less. That’s the point.</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: Is it December?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: Did Christmas come early this year…?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Better than that. We become partners. Only
in this territory and only on loads we run. And you don’t pay us three
thousand a ki. You pay us zero. Why we get is thirty percent of the
load. Product or cash. “And why,” you’re thinking, “would I be crazy
enough to out in these gringos like that? Is he chipping? Crazy for my
love? Too many mojitas?” And the answer is, “of course” but also “no. It
is because Sonny can deliver what no one else can.”</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: Good samba dancing…?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Zero risk.</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: ’Cause you don’t lose loads?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: ’Cause we guarantee every load. Anywhere,
for any reason, it comes up short, we make good. Your operations will,
from now on, run risk-free.</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: And you’re our thirty-percent partner?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Then I would say to you, this has been
fun…</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: The range should be between fifteen and
seventeen-point-five percent of the P.O.E….to even consider it.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: I need thirty. Calculate in, also, the
cash you don’t have to front…</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: Available cash is not an issue for us…</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Twenty-eight-point-five.</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: What if I pushed to twenty-one…?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: I would say you’re… …four percentage
points away from a deal…</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: Maybe I’m only one.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: We’ll do it at twenty-two…</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: And now I make you breakfast again…</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Where the hell are you, man?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: On my way back…</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: The meet with Castillo and the fed got set
up. It’s in 45 minutes…</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: What’s up, Sonny…?</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Where’d you go?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Hit a couple of jazz clubs. Fell back to
her place.</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Verdado.</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Verdado where?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: It’s in the suburbs outside Havana.</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Havana, Cuba…?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: No. Havana, Louisiana. Don’t we have a
meet?</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: …where you’re makin’ a move on the wife of
Archangel de Jesus Montoya?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: You’re not makin’ a move on her…?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: We’re makin’ moves on each other.</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Oh, that makes it okay, then.</p>
<p><strong>fujima</strong>: Who said, “go exploring”? We want this
staying on track.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Who’s the “we”? There’s you and there’s
us. And all we got from you was bad intel. “Low-level producer.” Yeah,
right…</p>
<p><strong>fujima</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Montoya. We went to meet the village
priest. It turns into Alice in the fucking Vatican and here’s the
Pope…of the North Valle Colombia dope trade.</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: His operations are kingpin size and
first-class. His security is ex- Eastern bloc, ex-SAS and Israelis.
Their comms are satellite uplink with mainframe encryption, significant
Sig Int and in their zones of activity, they have signal- jamming
capability…</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Yeah. CIA-level stuff…</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: And what does that level of spending on
first-class, private- sector infrastructure signify to you?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Mega-tonnage and mega-cash flow…</p>
<p><strong>fujima</strong>: Out of…?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Haiti and Puerto Rico. Money through Dubai
and Geneva maybe.</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Their loads are poly-drug. “E” from Holland,
methamphetamine precursors from Jordan, Afghan “H.” Mid-ocean
transshipments. His real business is: he’s a network.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: And we can illuminate part of it from the
inside out.</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: So we want to change-up the mission
statement.</p>
<p><strong>fujima</strong>: Identify and indict the white supremacist
group of importers. End of story. Everything else I’m hearing is
speculation masquerading as intel…</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Keys to the boat. Go do this motherfucker
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>fujima</strong>: Who are you talking to?</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: He’s talking to you, bro. What he means to
say is he is reluctant to abandon the penetration of a major
narcotrafficking organization…</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Hey, fuck him.</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Chill out Sonny.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: We’re the ones doing the death- defying
shit? And he wants us to give that up? For what? A chump-change bust so
he can get his picture in The Miami Herald to impress the slug farm in
DC…</p>
<p><strong>fujima</strong>: Control your men.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: I’m my own man. And anytime you want to
see how much man I am?</p>
<p><strong>castillo</strong>: That’s. It.</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: With Sonny. 110%.</p>
<p><strong>castillo</strong>: Then that’s it. Change the mission
statement. Crockett stays in. He keeps working up the ladder. The local
importers get a pass for the time being.</p>
<p><strong>fujima</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>castillo</strong>: Yes you do…</p>
<p><strong>fujima</strong>: I got to talk to my ADO…</p>
<p><strong>castillo</strong>: No, you don’t, Jim. ’Cause if I close this
down, you got nothing to make a phone call about. And my guys don’t have
a week for a Feeb bureaucratic process. Every hour longer they’re in
there, they risk exposure. So, right here, right now, they’re back in or
I pull them out and close you down. What’s it going to be?</p>
<p><strong>fujima</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>castillo</strong>: You fuckin’ better be right…!</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: What is going on…?!</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: As in…?</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: There is “undercover.” And there is “Which
way is up?”</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: You think I am in so deep I forgot?</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: I am asking. You to me.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Do you believe…I have forgotten I am a
cop?</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: I would never doubt you.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: No, I do not.</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: …90- and 120-day futures with shorted
Canadian and US dollars…</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: …and we’re looking at Nigerian crude…</p>
<p><strong>montoya</strong>: Precursor shipments from Ras Tanura and
Ju’aymah?</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: Transshipped to a Malaysian container
ship.</p>
<p><strong>montoya</strong>: Not French registry?</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: They’ve been targeted. And Pakistani
registry is too vulnerable to search and seizure right now.</p>
<p><strong>montoya</strong>: Jos� doesn’t like the deal in South
Florida…</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: Burnett? They want 22% of the value on
loads they run into South Florida. It’s the Juarez cartel model. They
guarantee the loads. The upside is our risk goes to zero. That frees-up
capital.</p>
<p><strong>montoya</strong>: But what does your intuition tell you…?</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: My “intuition”…? My intuition made him
breakfast the other morning in Havana.</p>
<p><strong>montoya</strong>: And…?</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: They’re serious. They’re cautious. They’ll
forgo a deal over a technicality of how a delivery’s handled…they’d walk
away, rather than compromise operational security…that’s good.</p>
<p><strong>montoya</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: A good deal, like this with us, for
Burnett will be good only temporarily. He’ll get restless because he
believes nothing is forever. Life is dust, make it while you can. He’s
ambitious.</p>
<p><strong>montoya</strong>: That’s my girl…</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: I think Jos� suspects anybody he doesn’t
intimidate. And people, who are good at what they do? They have egos,
too…</p>
<p><strong>montoya</strong>: What would you do…?</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: I like the diminished risk. It frees up
capital reserves. I like working with self-interested businessmen who
are competent. You can predict their behavior….</p>
<p><strong>montoya</strong>: Let’s try a few runs with these partners, I
think. I will tell Jos�…</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Hola, chica.</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: Hola, viejo.</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: Don’t stop, bad man…</p>
<p><strong>montoya</strong>: Do you have him?</p>
<p><strong>jos� yero</strong>: They are “wrong.” I do not trust
them.</p>
<p><strong>montoya</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>jos� yero</strong>: Too good at what they do, I don’t know.
Something I don’t like. They are wrong…</p>
<p><strong>montoya</strong>: Isabella likes them. We made their
deal.</p>
<p><strong>jos� yero</strong>: Transshipment point is here at 17:00
hours on the 23rd.</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Uh-uh. No predetermined places and times to
meet. Give me their heading and radio codes and I will talk to them
directly with the longs and lats and time which will be a last minute
deal…</p>
<p><strong>jos� yero</strong>: You give yours to me. We position all the
assets hauling our loads…</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Now how we do it, blood. It risks signal
interception and other bad things like people who don’t need to know
where we’re at knowing.</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: At ten to three on the 27th, I will satellite
page him with a website and encryption code. He will have ten minutes to
log on and receive his new heading. Ten minutes and thirty seconds,
website disappears and he can drive his fucking boat up to Iceland…</p>
<p><strong>jos� yero</strong>: Malaysian registry. Small containership.
Give them their codes and heading.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Packaging?</p>
<p><strong>jos� yero</strong>: Fifty-gallon drums. Thirty-two. A hundred
kilos in each. You transship that to the Malaysian boat.</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Importation value? At twenty-two thousand a
ki…</p>
<p><strong>jos� yero</strong>: You work that out with La Senora. You
will get sixteen fuel bladders of crystal meth precursors from the
Malaysian ship. For collection in North Miami. You warehouse it. Release
it when we say. I’m sure you have friends with fast boats…</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: If you see a few new faces, don’t get
jumpy…</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: And Jos�, my ace, lots of transshipment. Lots
of action. Skies are crowded. And the JIT has assets on land, air, and
sea. So any intel you got that can come our way and contribute to the
good and welfare…?</p>
<p><strong>jos� yero</strong>: Sure. Check your e-mail.</p>
<p><strong>jos� yero</strong>: You know what Escobar used to do?</p>
<p><strong>el tiburon</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jos� yero</strong>: In the ’80’s, air routes came into favor.
It required many pilots. The best were American. Former crop-dusters.
They didn’t fly by the book. Tell one: “Put that 747 down on this
fifteen-hundred-foot runway.” Somehow, he’d do it. Great pilots. But
Pablo had a rule. After they flew six loads…this good pilot who
facilitates so much good business… he would come back to Medell�n or
Barranquilla to pick up the next load? And no one would ever see him
again. He’d disappear. “You a good pilot? Make a lot of money for Pablo?
Thank you very much.” And then Pablo would kill his ass. After six
loads. And who was Pablo Escobar? A provincial who got busted-out by the
white collars from Cali. When the gringos got him, he was nobody. We’re
three times better than Pablo Escobar. The means we kill these
sonsabitches three times sooner. And do you know why Pablo Escobar did
that?</p>
<p><strong>el tiburon</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>jos� yero</strong>: He didn’t like pilots.</p>
<p><strong>jos� yero</strong>: And put eyes on her. Put eyes on her
twenty-four hours a day…</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: I forgot the napkins.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: And the chopsticks and fortune
cookies?</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: What’s the best fortune you ever got?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: They’re all the same. “Financial security
is around the corner.” “Your friends love you.”</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: In Kowloon, once, I got one that said,
“Live now because life is dust.”</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Do you have assets somewhere else? Bank
accounts?</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: …to fall back on. You know, a fail-safe.
Insurance.</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: Do I need it?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Everybody needs it. Ask Prudential. Or
Allstate.</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: ’Cause whatever can go wrong, will…?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Something like that. The odds catch up
with you. The odds are like gravity. You can’t negotiate with them.
So…at some point, you should cash out, take your money and run…</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Sure. As far away and as fast as you
can.</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Whenever. Maybe later, maybe sooner.</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: Would you find me…?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: Where would I go?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Zanzibar. The Comoros Islands. Somewhere
in the Indian Ocean. There’s twelve-hundred islands there…</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: Is this the protective male talk?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: This is the talk of a man…if he were your
husband…he would never put you at risk. He would never put you within a
thousand miles of anything that could hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: And if I were in the Comoros, in the
Indian Ocean, where would you be…?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: A few more moments, still in this
business. Then I’d find you.</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: Would you? Because if you couldn’t, I
would be very lonely… I would have left the only world I know and have
known since I was seventeen. But none of this will happen. So it doesn’t
matter. Because we are on the Guajira Peninsula. And all you see around
you…look around… is Archangel de Jesus Montoya- Londono. He is my man.
And you are a smuggler moving a load…</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: …in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: I’ll be on board by noon.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: Too fast. Too many moving parts.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Switek?</p>
<p><strong>switek</strong>: Same. But it’s your call, boss.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: What’s your take?</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: What’s the point? It’s going down.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Call the US Coast Guard: “Come and arrest
our ass.” And Switek resumes romancing Miss Ukraine…</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: If we were for real, and knew our shit, we’d
fade this one…</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Then you should.</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: If you’re down, we’re down for the play.</p>
<p><strong>aryan brother</strong>: El Tiburon.</p>
<p><strong>coleman</strong>: So…?</p>
<p><strong>el tiburon</strong>: Meth precursors and the Dutch party
favors are en route.</p>
<p><strong>coleman</strong>: All I want to know is the where and the
when. Spare me mini moves, progress reports and bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>el tiburon</strong>: Okay. You got the “item”?</p>
<p><strong>coleman</strong>: I got the item.</p>
<p><strong>el tiburon</strong>: And our friend don’t like the rest of
the people bringin’ the merch to you.</p>
<p><strong>coleman</strong>: How many?</p>
<p><strong>el tiburon</strong>: Two main players plus three.</p>
<p><strong>coleman</strong>: My end?</p>
<p><strong>el tiburon</strong>: 25% discount on the load.</p>
<p><strong>coleman</strong>: Make it 40%.</p>
<p><strong>el tiburon</strong>: Make it 35.</p>
<p><strong>coleman</strong>: Deal.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Me-a salama. Ila l-liqa.</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Yeah. Whatever…</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>jos� yero</strong>: Hey, Captain Kirk. I think maybe I have
second thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: You got something to say, Jos�, let’s hear
it.</p>
<p><strong>jos� yero</strong>: I confess I have succumbed to my
weaknesses. An inability to see another’s point of view. I’ve discussed
it with professionals. Even with one of your friends. She’s here
now…</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: What friend?</p>
<p><strong>jos� yero</strong>: Mrs. Rico. But don’t worry. She is safe.
To insure that, I am keeping her close to me. It’s always good to keep
people your friends care about close to you.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Proof of life. How do I know Mrs. Rico’s
alive?</p>
<p><strong>jos� yero</strong>: ’Cause she will tell you.</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: That sonofabitch!</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: You set this up!</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: Of course! That is why I placed myself
here, with you, knowing Yero would pull this crap.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Yero doesn’t know she’s here!</p>
<p><strong>switek</strong>: Cigarette and the two Starkeys are coming
in. What…?</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: They grabbed Gina…</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: It’s all bullshit. Jesus is out of
communication in Fals de Iguazu. Jos� knows that… Whatever he’s going to
do, he has to do it fast because he’s acting on his own. And he will
need a story.</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Meaning…?</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: They will kill you. And then they will
kill your wife, too.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Yero, by himself?</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: Maybe. Maybe with the crazy whites.</p>
<p><strong>zito</strong>: We’re half loaded…</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: Gina. Like Alonzo’s wife… Cochi Loco’s got
her.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Dump the rest. Let’s get the boats up that
river.</p>
<p><strong>castillo</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Jos� Yero changed-up the drop plan on us.
He’s grabbed Gina.</p>
<p><strong>castillo</strong>: Where’s the new drop point…?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: They’ll have surveillance on us. We’ll
know only at the last moment…</p>
<p><strong>castillo</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: It’s a rip and a hit.</p>
<p><strong>castillo</strong>: Get me Air Support… We’ll be airborne and
assault the ambush…</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: You can’t.</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: They’ll kill Gina.</p>
<p><strong>castillo</strong>: They may have already, so we protect the
living. Proof she’s alive?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Supposedly it’s coming.</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Hello…?</p>
<p><strong>lou dobbs</strong>: Welcome, folks. Today’s Friday, the
three-hundredth-and-fourteenth day of the year…</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: They’re proving it’s right now. And that
she’s alive right now…</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: …nice friends you got. Trailer trash with a
bad smell…</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Smell. Bad smell. Trailer… She’s allergic to
diethylene…she in a meth lab?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Just came in. She’s still alive.</p>
<p><strong>castillo</strong>: Safe house is empty… Air Support’s set to
jump when we know your drop point. Gina?</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: She’s sending a message. Meth Lab. Trailer
park. Anything with interesting antenna arrays…?</p>
<p><strong>castillo</strong>: There’s three between Miami International
and the glades. I’m gonna try for her, but this is triage. Protect the
maximum number of lives. You need to know that…</p>
<p><strong>castillo</strong>: Three possibles…</p>
<p><strong>castillo</strong>: …eliminated one. SWAT’s on the next
two…</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Trudy and I are goin’ for Gina…</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: If they attack you…</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: …it’s gonna be an L-shaped ambush. They’re
not gonna open up until they got the party favors, ’cause all they’d get
is a lot of police scrambling to a gunfight. They will wait till they
got the goods before they do the deed.</p>
<p><strong>castillo</strong>: Do you have her?!</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: Have eyes on her. She’s alive. Moving in…</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: Asian Star…</p>
<p><strong>aryan brother</strong>: You order Chinese?</p>
<p><strong>long-haired nlr guy</strong>: No, but I’m starving…</p>
<p><strong>aryan brother</strong>: Don’t…</p>
<p><strong>aryan brother</strong>: Shoot me, she dies. Hey, fuck it,
man. We can all go.</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: That’s not what will happen. What will happen
is… …what will happen is, I will put a round precisely through the
medula at the base of your brain, at an entry-point mid-distance between
your upper lip and the bottom of your nose, and you will be dead from
the neck down. Your finger won’t be able to twitch. Do you believe
that?</p>
<p><strong>aryan brother</strong>: Fuck…</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: Motherfucker!</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: He’s dead!</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: …got Gina. She’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>castillo</strong>: Go!</p>
<p><strong>yero</strong>: Isabella. The gringos are police. She’s their
informant…!</p>
<p><strong>yero</strong>: Go!</p>
<p><strong>pa</strong>: Freeze! You’re under arrest. Down on your knees.
Put your hands on your head…</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Isabella!!</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Touch the windshield with your hands. Let
’em see your hands are empty. Steady.</p>
<p><strong>swat sergeant</strong>: Don’t move! Don’t move! Keep your
hands where I can see them…</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Yeah. Hey, Robert.</p>
<p><strong>swat sergeant</strong>: Are you okay?!</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Yeah. Going to Miami General. Check out
Gina. Everybody’s okay. Everybody’s fine…</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Isabella…?</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: What are you going to do with me? Are you
taking me to jail? You think I will turn into your informant, is that
it?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: No part of it wasn’t real.</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: I know. And now?</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: It still is. I’m so in this, I don’t know
which way is up… All I know is I won’t let anything bad happen to you.
Just like I said. And I know we can’t ever see each other again. And we
never will.</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: You said time is luck…</p>
<p><strong>crockett</strong>: Luck ran out. This was too good to
last.</p>
