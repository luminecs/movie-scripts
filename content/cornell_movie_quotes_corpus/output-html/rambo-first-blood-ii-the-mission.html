<p><strong>clack.</strong>: The orderly’s good hand shoves the door
open.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: Shit. Maintenance never gets down here.</p>
<p><strong>singleterry</strong>: So what am I supposed to do? Can’t
transfer him to Leavenworth. He’s civilian. So I put him in an isolation
cell that hasn’t been used since the Spanish Inquisition.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: Maybe you should have tried cutting him
some slack.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>singleterry</strong>: Tranquilizer syrette gun. Borrowed it
from the Animal Control Department.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: Gimme a break. Open it.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: Thinks he’s the fucking Prince of
Darkness.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: At ease, Rambo.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: Wait outside.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: Hello, John.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Colonel.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: Mind if I sit down?</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: I hear you’re not enjoying it here.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: I could take it or leave it.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: Seems like I’m always pulling you out of
some goddamn toilet or other, doesn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Am I out of here?</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: That depends on you. Christ, look at you.
I give you this easy duty until I can get you an assignment… all you
have to do is eat ice cream and watch soap operas… and you have to make
it Rambo’s last stand.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: There were treating me like a headcase.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: Hard to believe. You shoot up one little
town in Oregon with a fifty caliber machine gun… one little dogpatch
town… and everybody figures your wrapper’s broken. No sense of humor.
What did you expect? An engraved plague from the chamber of
commerce?</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: In ’Nam I flew gunships. Million dollar
equipment. Back here nobody trusts me to park cars. I keep thinking it’s
going to be okay… but I’ve been out six years and it’s not okay.
Sometimes I feel like I’m coming right out of my skin.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: This your stuff?</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: That’s it. My life.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: Hardcore outfit. The best I ever
trained.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Those men are all dead.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: You’re not.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: Congressional Medal of Honor.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Yeah. Big time.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: Plus, what else? Two Silver Stars, four
Bronze Stars, two Soldier’s Medals, four Vietnamese Crosses of Gallantry
and… uh, a handful of Purple Hearts.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Five. I never wanted that stuff.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: What did you want?</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: I just wanted… I don’t know… after all that…
I just wanted one person, one person, to come up to me and say “you did
good, John.” And mean it. That’s all. After all that.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: You just picked that wrong war to be a
hero in.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: Let’s take a walk.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: Jason Kirkhill… John Rambo.</p>
<p><strong>kirkhill</strong>: Good to meet you, Rambo. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: You a spook?</p>
<p><strong>kirkhill</strong>: That’s right. CIA Special Operations
Division.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: I don’t work with spooks. Not after that op
in Cambodia.</p>
<p><strong>kirkhill</strong>: I’m authorized to get you out of here. I
thought that’s what you wanted.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: What’s the job?</p>
<p><strong>kirkhill</strong>: Classic special forces op… hit fast… in
and out. Two men. Two days.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Why me?</p>
<p><strong>kirkhill</strong>: We like you. At least the computer at
Langley likes you. Pulled your file because of various factors. Service
record. Area familiarity.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>kirkhill</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: I’m not jumping blind.</p>
<p><strong>kirkhill</strong>: It’s yes or no. In or out… now. If it’s
“out,” we will not have had this conversation. If you come in, you will
not be working for us. No knowledge. No comment. Do you understand?</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: Tell him. I’ll take responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>kirkhill</strong>: North Vietnam. What they call the
Democratic Republic of Vietnam now.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: We left some people behind there, John…
POWs.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: This just occurred to somebody, now?</p>
<p><strong>kirkhill</strong>: We don’t leave our men, Rambo.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: You got it. I’m in.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Three-fo-your-lef, lef-right-lef… Other
lef shithead! Square those pieces away… square ’em away girls! I
said…</p>
<p><strong>kirkhill</strong>: This is your mission packet…</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: Sign here, please. And here.</p>
<p><strong>kirkhill</strong>: Memorize it here. It doesn’t leave this
room.</p>
<p><strong>kirkhill</strong>: The twenty-four hundred American
servicemen missing in action in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia are
officially listed “Presumed Killed.” Certainly most of them are.</p>
<p><strong>kirkhill</strong>: But reports keep filtering in. Sightings
by refugees. Nothing verified. Finally, we feel we’ve got enough to
proceed on.</p>
<p><strong>kirkhill</strong>: Memo E-7 on top will cover the details. An
abandoned Vietnamese Army base in the North-central highlands may have a
compound used as an internment camp. As you can see the intelligence is
soft. These LANDSAT photos show huts… barracks. It could be
anything.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: What’s the plan?</p>
<p><strong>kirkhill</strong>: This operation is in two phases. Recon and
rescue. You are phase one. Your two-man team will probe the site,
confirm the presence of American POWs, if any, make photographic and
tactical observations, then proceed to the extraction point without
engaging the enemy.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: We don’t try to pull out any of our guys if
we find them?</p>
<p><strong>kirkhill</strong>: Negative. Absolutely not. The phase two
assault team will get them out.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: We just take pictures?</p>
<p><strong>kirkhill</strong>: Don’t look so disappointed. It should be
hairy enough… even for you.</p>
<p><strong>kirkhill</strong>: Your flight to Bangkok is at 06:30.
Commercial carrier. Low profile. Rendezvous with Colonel Trautman at the
Indra. Room 618. You’ll meet your number two man, Lieutenant Brewer. He
doesn’t get a packet… you brief him verbally.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Sorry old buddy, I saw it first.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I kinda got an important date.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: No problem. We’ll share it. Get your tail in
there, sweet thing.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Indra Hotel. And don’t take the scenic route,
Smiley… I know my way around this burg. Comprende?</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Same place for me.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Ah, you fair flower of the Orient.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: She thinks everything I say is funny. Don’t
you, Angel-pie? Man, Thai women are the best. Got the kinda legs I like…
feet at one end and pussy at the other.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: You don’t say a helluva lot, do you, pal? You
speak English?</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>thai girl</strong>: You got money? I stay you whole week.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Sweet thing, there’s nothin’ I’d like more than
to wugga-wugga with you for a week, but tonight’s all we got.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: See, I’m on this secret mission, and tomorrow
mornin’ I head out to…</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: That’s enough, Brewer.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: You’re Rambo? Ke-rist!</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Get out. Now!</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: Jeez, I never would have guessed. You
undercover, Lieutenant? Great disguise.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: He says he’s team leader on this show.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: That’s correct.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: Begging the Colonel’s pardon but I
understood I was up to lead my next mission.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: Not this one. You’re on communications and
camera. Same image-intensified gear you used in El Salvador last
year.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: This clown almost blew mission security on
the street. I’m not jumping with him.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: Clown? Now back up there, buddy…</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: Listen up. You two are married as of now.
Get used to it.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: I say we tape him to a chair.</p>
<p><strong>kirkhill</strong>: I didn’t know you were a stick man,
Rambo.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: I was crossed-trained in gunships.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: How long have you been setting up?</p>
<p><strong>kirkhill</strong>: About 22 hours on site.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: Nice work.</p>
<p><strong>kirkhill</strong>: This is a covert operation, numbnuts.</p>
<p><strong>kirkhill</strong>: Check out the command hut.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: Mission control!</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: All this is for us?</p>
<p><strong>kirkhill</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: They call us the field-unit meat-
puppets.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: Ever do this from a jet?</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: It’s easy…</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Just have to jump fast.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: You the pilot?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Yeah. Doyle. Lifer and Fuhrman.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: You boys Air Force?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Marines. ‘Ex’ though. We’re private
contractors now.</p>
<p><strong>lifer</strong>: You ever do a tour ‘in-country’?</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Two. ‘Eye-corps’ mostly.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: How about you?</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: Vietnam was a little before my time. So was
Korea, know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Thailand. The Mekong. Laos. ’Nam.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: A straight dash across the Laotian panhandle,
through the Annamese Mountains… some good dicey bits there… and on to
the drop zone. Eighteen minutes each way in communist airspace.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: We go low to stay off radar?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: In the rhubarb, babe.</p>
<p><strong>fuhrman</strong>: Mowin’ the lawn.</p>
<p><strong>lifer</strong>: Dig it.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: How long before you’re fully on line?</p>
<p><strong>kirkhill</strong>: Couple hours. Let me buy you a coffee.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: You think they’ll find any?</p>
<p><strong>kirkhill</strong>: POWs? I don’t know. But either way it’ll
get that subcommittee off our necks. Cream?</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: Black. No sugar.</p>
<p><strong>kirkhill</strong>: The League of Families leans on Congress.
Then they lean on us. Like we don’t have enough to worry about in a
dozen dirtwater countries. Damnit!</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: A couple klicks from insertion we go vertical
to ten thousand and you punch out. Navigate in free fall like a regular
HALO jump. You’ll have a good moon.</p>
<p><strong>lifer</strong>: I got your moon right here…</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: No problem. Duck soup.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Hey, man… we got fuel on the deck. I don’t
like flying without a plane.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: No smoking on this mission. It’s not
healthy.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: Son of a bitch!</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Nice trick. Works nine times out of ten.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Again.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: Insertion. Call in to base camp by TRANSAT.
Proceed to point Tango November for rendezvous with our ground contact.
Indigenous agent. Co Phuong Bao. We’ve been over this three times.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: You stopped.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: Co Phuong Bao. The guide takes us twelve
klicks upriver to target at Ban… at Ban… Bo Peep. Shit!</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Start over.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: … to target at Ban Kia Na. We probe the
site…</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Ninety.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: … then proceed downriver to extraction at
point Echo Delta. Doyle takes us out by helicopter, we all live happily
ever after and that’s the last time, Rambo! I swear to Christ.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: One hundred.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: Gettin’ old, huh?</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Yeah. Second set. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: Transponder-satellite relay.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: The signal’s coded into infrared pulses,
picked up by the spy satellite, bounced to the ground station in Okinawa
and relayed to the hut…</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: No radio source. Nothing for the bad guys to
triangulate on.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Show me how it operates.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: That’s what I’m here for.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Show me in case you get zapped as soon as we
land.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: We’re leaving tonight, not in a week.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: Alright. Alright.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: You jumping with all that?</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: Yeah. Why not?</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: You break your leg, I’ll have to shoot
you.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: I think he means it.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: Crazy fucker.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Well, son. You got that right. Anybody ever
tell you about that guy?</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: What about him?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Ready to roll, Lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Let’s do it.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: Keep it clean, Rambo, or I’ll nail your
hide to the shed.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: You got it, sir.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Zen Rollercoaster, requesting clearance.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You are cleared, Zen Rollercoaster.</p>
<p><strong>fuhrman</strong>: Switching communications to burst mode.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: AWACS Two-Five has acquired. They are
holding timeline.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Here comes the sexy part.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: Whoo-ya! I love it!</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: We just entered Viet airspace, gentlemen.
Eight klicks to insertion.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Stay tight on me, Brewer. I don’t want to
have to go looking for you.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: Check.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: AWACS Niner-One via Subic Bay reports
them approaching insertion. Five-by-Five.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Stand by to climb.</p>
<p><strong>farmer</strong>: Son of a bitch!</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Approaching ten thousand. Eleven seconds to
insertion. Ten, nine… Slowing to two-thirty…</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: … three seconds. Two. One. Have a nice
day.</p>
<p><strong>lifer</strong>: Go!</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: You read me, Brewer?</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: Read you.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Home on my strobe.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Man, what are you doing back here?</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: Keep it down, man. I got problems.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: That’s one.</p>
<p><strong>tech</strong>: It’s coming in.</p>
<p><strong>kirkhill</strong>: They’re in! On the money.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: What do you call that?</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: Modified M-16 A2 and over-under M-79 grenade
launcher, with Sionics sound suppressor, Tracor starlight scope and
LAC/R-100 Laser sighting system.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Batteries not included.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: This is state-of-the-art firepower.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: AC-System ‘Big-Ear’ telescopic mike with
built-in audio processor. Can pull a whisper out of a loud cocktail
party at 50 meters.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Cocktail party. Uh huh, right. Let’s saddle
up.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: Where’s your stuff?</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: That’s it? Some C-4, a map and a knife?</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: There’s a compass in the handle.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: And a beat-to-shit AK? Every twelve-year-old
in Nam’s got one of those.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: Uh… this thing’s pretty heavy. You got room
for it?</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: Just a thought.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: You wanna know why I stood up for this
show?</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: I was in the brig. They gave me a deal. I
blew up this Colonel’s golf cart with an M-19. He wasn’t in it or
anything… it was the symbolic value. Seemed like a good idea at the
time.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: That’s a real good reason to wind up in
’Nam.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: I’ve seen worse places.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: There are no worse places.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: This place is a trip.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Buddhist monastery. Fifteenth century.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: Damn! Leeches.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Get used to ’em.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: You fucking crazy? I need it to burn these
things off.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: No cigarettes.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: I had it cupped.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: Look, Rambo. I’ve had enough of your bad-ass
Indian-scout bullshit. You’re years out of date… I’m makin’ a career out
of teaching you the hardware. As far as I’m concerned you’re just along
to back me up. And I heard about you… about how twitchy you really are.
Kill any civilians lately?</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Listen real careful, freshmeat. I don’t know
why they sent you. Maybe they didn’t want to waste a good man. But you
screw up once more and I’ll kill you myself.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: Man, are you strict.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You are first tourist here in long time.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: You come here see Buddha… ask for truth? Or
just lost?</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: Should I waste her?</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: I’m not lost. Just looking for someone.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Someone called maybe ‘Night Orchid’?</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: I’m Co Phuong Bao.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: She’s our contact.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: I didn’t know you spoke Vietnamese.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: I’m Rambo. This is Brewer. Her name is
Co.</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: It means “virgin.” My mother was comedian.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: Howdy, Co.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: Uh, you speak pretty good English. Where’d
you learn?</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: University of Saigon. Have Masters Degree in
economics. Not use too much now… Communists in charge. You got time…
want to eat?</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Sure. Whattaya got?</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: Nuac mam.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: You really got a Masters Degree?</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: Sure. I only sound like forty-year- old in your
language.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: What’s this stuff on the rice?</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Fermented fish sauce.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: How do we get upriver?</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: I have arranged transportation. We meet soon.
But I think you to be disappointed.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Why’s that?</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: I go up to this camp two months ago. Nobody
there. Empty for years.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Why would they send us to a deserted
camp?</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: Who cares? Let’s just do it and get out. Go
have a Jacuzzi and get laid in Bangkok. Know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: We’ll check it out.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: How come we didn’t just drop near the camp…
save this hassle?</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Brewer. Does a jet make noise?</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: Where did you find this clown?</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: I thought he was with you.</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: Crazy motherfucker.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: What’s she saying?</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: She likes you. Says you’re dinky- dau.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Powerful warrior.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: Yeah. Dinky-dau, that’s me. Hey, Co. You
wanna meet Jake the one- eyed snake?</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: These guys look like they’d sell their
mothers.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Sometimes they do. They’re river pirates.
Opium runners.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: Pirates? No kidding?</p>
<p><strong>captain trong kinh</strong>: Wa-ky number one. You come
number one sampan.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Thank you, Captain, for your hospitality. You
speak English very well.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: Looks like my room in college.</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: We sleep here today. Safe here while go up
river.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: What about patrol boats?</p>
<p><strong>kirkhill</strong>: No, sir… we’re already committed. They’re
in the jungle right now. I say we play the hand through… if they find
something we just bury the report later. It’s still airtight. Yes,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>kirkhill</strong>: Goddamn it! Now the goddamn satellite
shows the camp occupied… some trucks or something.</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: Oh, boy. It’s getting dicey.</p>
<p><strong>kirkhill</strong>: What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: Listen, Kirkhill. I’m a bit of a fifth
wheel in your setup here… I thought I’d go out with the extraction team
tonight. Unless you have an objection.</p>
<p><strong>kirkhill</strong>: It’s not necessary.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>kirkhill</strong>: That’s a pretty hairy ride. Full Colonels
are supposed to be above that sort of thing.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: I know…</p>
<p><strong>kirkhill</strong>: Have fun.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Have some armpit sauce.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: How did you get started working for the
spooks?</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: Spooks?</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Intelligence work.</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: Oh. They talk to me at university before fall of
Saigon. Make deal.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: Everybody’s makin’ deals.</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: My brother captain in ARVN… need papers to go
United States, or North Vietnamese will execute. They make deal… I stay
here and do work… my brother and my son can go United States.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Your son?</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: Nguyen. He twelve now. Not see him for eight
years.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Where’s his father?</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: Dead. Killed in war.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Where’s Nguyen now? What city?</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: Huntington Beach, California.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: It’s nice there. He’s probably digging every
minute. Got a surfboard. Breaking girls’ hearts.</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: Nguyen is good boy.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: Some hardened guerrilla fighter they gave
us.</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: River patrol!</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: How you doing, Brewer?</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: I need a vacation.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Check the tower with your scope.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: Nobody home. Wait a minute! Cigarette.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: What’s he here for?</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: Snoring. Five, six guys. Mumbling…
Vietnamese. Somebody talking in his sleep. A toilet flushing.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Guard barracks. Take some shots.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: Breathing. Moaning. Shit!</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Bad dreams. Prisoner’s barracks. Shoot
some.</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: Cyclo-girl whore from village. Business slow
there.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: She’s making him a pretty good deal.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: What’s that? By the far tower.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: It’s a guy in a cage.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: American?</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: Can’t tell. Pretty tall. He’s real scrunched
up in that thing.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Let me see.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Roundeye.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: Alright. Home run.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Torture cage. Can’t stand… can’t sit… for
days. Sometimes weeks.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: Bastards. Let’s get some shots.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: That guy’s not going to make it.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: Nothing we can do, man.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: I’m getting him out.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: What? Are you crazy? We’re supposed to take
pictures and split. You’re gonna blow the whole program.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: You never been in one of those things.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: I suppose you have…</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: It’s orders! You remember… when they tell
you to do something and then you do it. John Wayne is dead, man.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: You take pictures and split. I’m going
in.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: Fuck it. Fuck it. Aw… ke-rist.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: How we gonna do it?</p>
<p><strong>prisoner</strong>: Who’re you?</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: American. Come to get you out.</p>
<p><strong>prisoner</strong>: Man, you are one scary-looking
motherfucker!</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Can you walk?</p>
<p><strong>prisoner</strong>: I could a couple of days ago. Gonna be…
stiff.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>prisoner</strong>: De Fravio. Dave De Fravio. Lieutenant… Air
Force.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Good to meet you, Dave. I’m Rambo. Okay, I’m
going to carry you. Don’t cough or make any noise.</p>
<p><strong>de fravio</strong>: Sure thing, Rambo. You gettin’ the other
guys, too?</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Not this time. We’ll be back.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: That’s two.</p>
<p><strong>de fravio</strong>: You guys are real… aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>de fravio</strong>: Sorry, I mean… I talk to people all the
time… I know a lot of them aren’t there. But this is real, isn’t it?
You’re taking me home now?</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: That’s right, buddy.</p>
<p><strong>de fravio</strong>: Thank God… thank you…</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: We’d better go for the emergency LZ at point
Zulu Sierra. Tell them we’ve got some heat but don’t mention De
Fravio.</p>
<p><strong>tech</strong>: You’re go for extraction. Mr. Kirkhill says
wind ’er up. Here’s the hardcopy.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: Alternate LZ Zulu Sierra at 0500. It says
“May have heat. Don’t be late. All our love.”</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Let’s get that tent down!</p>
<p><strong>de fravio</strong>: I gotta tell you, it’s just luck you guys
came when you did. They move us around a lot… We only been at that camp
a week. Got a smoke?</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>de fravio</strong>: What kind of raggedy-ass rescue you call
this?</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Why were you in the box?</p>
<p><strong>de fravio</strong>: Well, I caught this cobra, see…</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: You mean the snake?</p>
<p><strong>de fravio</strong>: Yeah. It’s not hard once you get the hang
of it. In the wrist. Anyway, I did what I always do when I get one…</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>de fravio</strong>: Put it in the guard’s barracks. Man they
got pissed. They beat the crap out of me, but… it’s kind of a tradition.
You oughta see ’em run around.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: You got a bad attitude.</p>
<p><strong>de fravio</strong>: I know it.</p>
<p><strong>de fravio</strong>: Thanks lady. You’re pretty cute… doing
anything this weekend?</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: Eat slowly. Don’t make yourself sick.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: Twenty-five minutes. We’d better roll.</p>
<p><strong>kinh</strong>: Wa-ky number ten. Do-ma.</p>
<p><strong>de fravio</strong>: Yeah, fuck your mama-san, too. In
the…</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: You slope bitch!</p>
<p><strong>de fravio</strong>: Wow!</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: What just happened?</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: Yes. But I lose many merits in next life. Very
bad.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Why’d they want us?</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: They heard about escaped prisoner on radio. Make
deal. More than we pay.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: They sold us out? Now I’m pissed.</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: They were fools. To think there would be reward.
And to ask my help.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: Rambo. NVA coming. Pig dog Kinh say meet them
here. Whole garrison from Con Cuong is out.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>lifer</strong>: Back in Indian country. Just like old
times.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: Let’s ditch this Transat. We don’t need
it.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Bury it here. Work fast.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: You better take off.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: Ain’t you coming with us, sweet thing?</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: My orders stay here.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: See you in California.</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: Land of big PX. Maybe I take you for a ride in
my Cadillac.</p>
<p><strong>fuhrman</strong>: Three minutes.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Zen Hammer this is Slam Dunk One, do you
copy? Over.</p>
<p><strong>fuhrman</strong>: Roger, Slam Dunk One… what is your
position?</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Zen Hammer… the heat’s on. We’re taking fire.
Watch for my smoke. Red and green. Northwest corner of a big paddy.
Let’s move.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: Go for it, man. Good therapy.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: You guys comin’ or what?</p>
<p><strong>fuhrman</strong>: Roger… we have you on visual. We are coming
in. How many are you?</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: Three. We got an American POW with us.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: Relay to command. They have one of
ours.</p>
<p><strong>telecom tech</strong>: Mr. Kirkhill… I have an AWACS relay.
Zen Hammer reports the ground team has an American POW with them.</p>
<p><strong>kirkhill</strong>: What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>telecom tech</strong>: They’ve got one of ours.</p>
<p><strong>kirkhill</strong>: This station is now on Condition Bravo.
Harrison. Meyers. Goodell. Out… now!</p>
<p><strong>kirkhill</strong>: Go to your COMINT priority frequency. Give
me the mike… Zen Hammer, this is Coach One. This is an Alpha-Kilo-Victor
command priority.</p>
<p><strong>fuhrman</strong>: Roger, Coach One… go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>kirkhill</strong>: I want you to abort the operation
immediately.</p>
<p><strong>fuhrman</strong>: Say again, Coach One?</p>
<p><strong>fuhrman</strong>: He wants us to abort before pick-up.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: Confirm it.</p>
<p><strong>fuhrman</strong>: It is confirmed. Coach One… we have them in
sight… Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Turnin’ around.</p>
<p><strong>fuhrman</strong>: I thought you liked those guys.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: I do. But they ain’t payin’ the rent,
Jack.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: Stay on your heading, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Sorry, Sir. Can’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: That’s an order.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Sorry, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>lifer</strong>: We ain’t Uncle Sam’s misguided children no
more, Colonel. We’re independent contractors.</p>
<p><strong>fuhrman</strong>: That’s right, Sir. We don’t like this, but
we are working for Mr. Kirkhill.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: You pathetic scum.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Well, if there weren’t POWs before, there are
now.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: Where’s he going? Hey, Zen Hammer, where are
you going? Do you read, Zen Hammer? Over. Son of a bitch! They’re
ditching us!</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: The fuckers left us, man… they left us.</p>
<p><strong>de fravio</strong>: Oh… God.</p>
<p><strong>kirkhill</strong>: Have a drink.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>kirkhill</strong>: You got five hours? I’ll tell you about
Secretaries of State, and funding committees and diplomatic
relations…</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: Take your time.</p>
<p><strong>kirkhill</strong>: Look, Colonel… we’re all adults here. This
is a war. A very quiet, very intense war. People get sacrificed.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: Not my people.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: But you’re right… some people do get
sacrificed. Now tell me why you pulled the plug.</p>
<p><strong>kirkhill</strong>: You think I’m some whacko? I like to hurt
people? I’m doing a job here. If I knew what’s right or wrong I’d be a
goddamned priest, right? So I follow directives… I do what I’m told.
It’s simple. If your boy had done what he was told, there wouldn’t be a
problem.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: Don’t dance me, Kirkhill. You’ll be
walking funny.</p>
<p><strong>kirkhill</strong>: Look, it was a screw-up, alright? They
weren’t supposed to find anything. We thought that camp was empty.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: This mission was a scam from the word
go?</p>
<p><strong>kirkhill</strong>: Word came down… they wanted an answer. And
they knew the answer they wanted: no POWs. But it had to look good. Best
effort. The whole dog-and-pony show.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: Rambo and Brewer were selected as
write-offs.</p>
<p><strong>kirkhill</strong>: It was clean. Very clean… Rambo was a
decorated Vietnam vet, a former POW himself… if he came out and said “No
POWs” the sub-committee would buy it. He gets himself caught he’s a
private citizen, a whacko, acting on his own. If he gets proof, it gets
lost somewhere between here and D.C. Airtight. But no… Rambo’s gotta be
a hero. Thinks he’s starring in his own war movie or something. He put
me in a corner. No choice.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: “Terminate with extreme prejudice.”</p>
<p><strong>kirkhill</strong>: That’s a crock. We don’t say that. Do you
have any idea the shitstorm if he’d gotten back with that guy? If it
went public? The White House would have to act through channels. We’re
talking ransom. Four billion bucks in war reparations to Vietnam to get
the others back. That’s billion, Colonel. With a “B”. For a few guys
that’ve had their brains in a blender for ten years? A pain in the ass
to everybody? No way. There’s no way.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: So there never was a Phase Two rescue
team?</p>
<p><strong>kirkhill</strong>: Of course not. You can’t get approval to
rescue a kitten from a tree after Tehran.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>kirkhill</strong>: Here. Drink.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: I understand your position. I understand
how a maggot like you can just slide out of a jam on a trail of slime.
And call it – expedience. Expedience!</p>
<p><strong>kirkhill</strong>: You’re out of your depth, Trautman. Way
out. I’m acting correctly here. Not you. Not your gung-ho jungle ace.
It’s over. Walk away.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: It’s not over. You made one mistake.</p>
<p><strong>kirkhill</strong>: What that?</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: Rambo.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: Are they going to torture us?</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: What… whattaya do?</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Hope they kill you by mistake.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: No talk!</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: This ain’t happening.</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: We were pulling for you, Dave. We hoped
you’d make it.</p>
<p><strong>de fravio</strong>: Next time.</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: It’s those Russian interrogators again.</p>
<p><strong>podovsk</strong>: Put him in the chair.</p>
<p><strong>podovsk</strong>: Thank you, Captain Vinh. Leave one guard,
please.</p>
<p><strong>podovsk</strong>: These people are so… vulgar in their
approach. I am Lieutenant Commander Podovsk. I do not know who you are.
Will you tell me?</p>
<p><strong>podovsk</strong>: No? Not even your name? This is a poor
beginning for an intimate relationship. By tomorrow or the next day you
will tell me things you would not tell a lover.</p>
<p><strong>podovsk</strong>: I see you are no stranger to pain. Then of
course you must know how senseless it is to resist in the long run. Is
it possible you have been among my Vietnamese comrades before?</p>
<p><strong>podovsk</strong>: Yes. I think that must be it. Where were
you held? Hanoi? Son Tay? I apologize. I’m getting ahead. Sometimes I
get too eager. My comrade and I, in our capacity as advisors, have been
sent from our center at Cam Ranh Bay to discover from you certain
things… for example: whether you are working directly for the American
government… Who your contacts were… and on and on. Quite a list. Will
you tell me these things now?</p>
<p><strong>podovsk</strong>: Of course you won’t. But, as a moral man, I
felt compelled to ask.</p>
<p><strong>podovsk</strong>: This is Lieutenant Palyushin. To him you
are a piece of meat. Proceed.</p>
<p><strong>podovsk</strong>: I was sent here because of my command of
your language. It will be frustrating if we cannot have a nice chat.
Very frustrating. Ready?</p>
<p><strong>podovsk</strong>: Test please.</p>
<p><strong>podovsk</strong>: Oh, yes. Here is something you might be
interested in.</p>
<p><strong>podovsk</strong>: A transcript of the conversation between
your helicopter pilot and his commander, intercepted and unscrambled by
our overworked cryptography staff. Mmm. “Zen Hammer… Slam Dunk.”
Colorful names. Here we are: “Ah, Coach One… we have them in sight.” And
the reply: “Abort immediately. Return to base camp.”</p>
<p><strong>podovsk</strong>: It seems they intentionally abandoned you
on direct orders. There are the people you protect with your silence?
With your pain?</p>
<p><strong>podovsk</strong>: But you must scream. You must. There is no
shame.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: Bastards!</p>
<p><strong>podovsk</strong>: Nyet! Nyet!</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: We get out. Split up. They not want me.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: You are amazing.</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: Di di mau! Go! Go!</p>
<p><strong>palyushin</strong>: Find! Now!</p>
<p><strong>toward him.</strong>: It races over him, backlighting him as
he dives off the trail. The searchlight flicks past him. Snaps back.</p>
<p><strong>red slashes of death.</strong>: Rambo tumbles, rolls, comes
up running. He tears through the jungle in a frenzy. The foliage is
alive with blasting air.</p>
<p><strong>tay</strong>: Where’s Trang?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Vuoc? You alright?</p>
<p><strong>tay</strong>: Bui? Phong? Than?</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: Bob, hi. Did you get my telex? Yeah, I
know what time it is there… do you know what time it is here? Look, is
there anything you can do up the line? You owe me one. I’m calling it
in. Yes, this time. I know you’re a general and I’m only a colonel. So
that’s it, huh? Back off. Come home… that’s it? Thanks, buddy.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: Get me a “Loach,” I’m going back out to
Ban Bung Kla.</p>
<p><strong>corporal</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>de fravio</strong>: Hey, Brewer. You okay?</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: I could use a beer.</p>
<p><strong>de fravio</strong>: Your buddy made it out last night. The
place went apeshit.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: Really? How come he didn’t take me?</p>
<p><strong>de fravio</strong>: Maybe because you’re shot in the leg.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: Oh, yeah. Listen, how long do they keep you
in this disease hole?</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Who knows? I was in there for a month once.
De Fravio did three months.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: How do you keep from coming unglued?</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Concentrate on a problem. Like, I built my
dream house in my head, brick by brick. Board by board. If something
really takes a day, I thought about it for a whole day. Like that.</p>
<p><strong>de fravio</strong>: I built a shopping mall.</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Guards. See ya.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: Watch it. Don’t fuck with me, man! I’m dinky
dau!</p>
<p><strong>podovsk</strong>: I think you know where he is going. Is
there a rendezvous point? Some guerrilla contract? A transmitter
perhaps.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: No way. If I say anything… that’s three.</p>
<p><strong>podovsk</strong>: I cannot be responsible for the safety of
the prisoners if he is not captured. This government now considers the
existence of POWs an embarrassment. An unmarked grave in the jungle may
be their solution. I am only an advisor.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: Advise my dick, you Siberian scumbag.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: Ke-rist. Whattaya trying to do, man, tickle
me?</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Keep driving.</p>
<p><strong>vinh</strong>: You see? Not a demon. A man. Now, we find
where he’s crawled to die.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: This your first day?</p>
<p><strong>podovsk</strong>: You think you can provoke us into beating
you unconscious? We are not that… unskilled.</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: I’ve had it with you, ratface. Don’t piss me
off!</p>
<p><strong>brewer</strong>: Aaargh. God damn that… was… good! Do it
again, you fuck! Come on… I love it! You hear me… I LOVE IT!</p>
<p><strong>tech</strong>: More AWACS intercepts. The Russian takes time
to translate.</p>
<p><strong>kirkhill</strong>: He’s giving them a run for their money.
Says here they’ve got two Hueys from Danang. I didn’t know those dinks
had Hueys.</p>
<p><strong>tech</strong>: Half their air force is our stuff.
Captured.</p>
<p><strong>kirkhill</strong>: Typical…</p>
<p><strong>tech</strong>: Sir, there’s something else… a TRANSAT relay.
Just came through.</p>
<p><strong>kirkhill</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You not so hard to catch, dinky dau
Rambo.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Christ. How’d you get here?</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: Took bus, most of way. I knew you would come
here.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: And how’d you sneak up like that?</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: Carefully. Don’t want to get shot by you. Bad
karma. Anyway, you need me.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: I do?</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: You think you are… .</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Invulnerable.</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: In-vul-nerabo. But you get ass kicked without
me.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Yeah. We’re a pretty good team.</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: You look like hell. Wounds infected. Come up to
the ruins, I have medical kit.</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: You try get across Laos? Get to Thailand?</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Yeah. Got some business there. What are you
gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: Go United States. See Nguyen. Maybe teach
economics. Buy Cadillac. Watch “Dynasty.”</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: How you going to get there? You can’t trust
the spooks to pull you out. They’ll use you up and throw you away.</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: I know. I go with you.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: I couldn’t get you in.</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: Yes you can.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: As wife.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Okay. Done. You got it.</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: You too easy.</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: You don’t feel love, Rambo?</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Look, Co…</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: Why you don’t feel love? Not allowed? Dead
inside, maybe? You make yourself dead already so they can’t kill you?
In-vulnerabo? Bullshit!</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: Bucu bullshit! I have enough death already.
Husband. Mother. Father. Brothers. Death everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: You see? A flower like that need good soil to
grow. Many time under earth is bones of animal… or person. Killed in
jungle. Make soil rich. Grows most beautiful flower. You call orchid.
Many deaths in jungle. Vietnamese, V.C., American. Many beautiful
flowers.</p>
<p><strong>palyushin</strong>: Get your men back. I’m beginning an
attack run.</p>
