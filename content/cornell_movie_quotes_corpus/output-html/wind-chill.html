<p><strong>proctor</strong>: That’s it, people! Wrap it up!</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Do you think you could have parked any further
from the entrance?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: There were still cars when I got here. I
thought we were going to get an early start to stay ahead of the
snow?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Quarter past three.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I’m two hours late?! Shit. Sorry. You
should’ve just left without me. That’s what I would’ve done. Hurry up
and pop the trunk so I can stow my shit.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: I’m kinda getting kicked out of my apartment. I
didn’t have time to find someplace new before exams.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Why don’t you just get the engine started and
put the heat on? I can handle this.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Sorry… it sticks.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: That’s as far as it goes. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Where are you? No, we’re just rolling out… …
Believe me, I tried, but I couldn’t get a flight. It’s my own fault for
waiting `til the last minute…</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: What, are you kidding? I’m bored to tears… No,
we’re still on the highway… how should I know, all highways look exactly
alike.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: You going to be on that thing the whole-</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Uh oh, somebody’s upset. I better call you
back. Who do you think? Ride Board Guy. Okay, `bye.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: This isn’t cool. If I have to drive, you have
to talk to me.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: What, I’m the in-flight entertainment?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: That’s how this ride-sharing thing works.
Division of labor. We split everything fifty-fifty… Get it?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I’ve got news for you, I don’t get much more
entertaining than when I’m on the phone.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: This is turning out great.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: What’s that mean?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: So you’re from Wilmington, huh?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Where’d you go to school?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Um… Saint Vitus Academy.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: St. Vitus? You’re making that up.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: You’re acquainted with every school in the
area?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Pretty much, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Including all the Catholic ones? Because that’s
where I went. Saint Vitus Academy for Catholic Boys.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Okay, fine…</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: We had a class together, you know.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Intro to Modern Philosophy.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: What? There were about a million people in
that class. It was like Woodstock. Did you ever see so many Eastern
religion types? So, what’s your major?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Eastern religions.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: No. Why?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: I don’t know. I just assumed…</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Why would you assume anything about me? We
just met.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: I don’t know… I guess you just… look like a
philosophy major.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Try engineering.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Nietzsche’s theory of eternal recurrence.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Which is basically reincarnation, right?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: No, they’re not really the same thing.
Reincarnation is when you come back as something different and eternal
recurrence is when you</p>
<p><strong>11 continued: 11</strong>: GUY</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: He died of syphilis, you know.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Next gas station you see, do me a favor and
pull over. I gotta pee.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Okay, I’ll keep my eyes peeled.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: That phrase. `Keeping your eyes peeled.’ It’s
kind of creepy, if you think about it.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Huh. Actually, yeah, it is sorta.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: They use a laser.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Well, yeah, they do… But there’s definitely
peeling involved too. I saw it on Discovery Health. If more people knew
about the peeling part they might think twice before going under the
knife.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Laser.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Right, laser.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I’m having corrective eye surgery over the
break.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: It’s okay. I’m not really worried.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I’m not worried?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: You’re getting it done…</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Because I hate wearing glasses.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: But they look good on you.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: How do you know? I don’t wear them outside my
dorm.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: You sure? You never… to class or anything?
Because I could swear I-</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Never.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Huh. Weird. I wonder why I thought-</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: I thought you had to pee?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I didn’t expect us to find a bathroom so soon.
My nails aren’t dry.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: That’s okay, they’ll be dry in just a
second.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Come on, I’m good at this…</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: You are not carrying me inside.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Hold on.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: What are you doing?! Wait -</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: You can let me down now.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Didn’t you hear me banging in there?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: You think it’s funny? Me locked in?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Locked in where?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: You’re telling me you didn’t just hear me
banging on the door?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: I don’t know what you’re-</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Forget it. Let’s just get on the road.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Remember, highway’s your best bet-</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Don’t worry about it man, I got it all
covered.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Are we lost or something?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: No, I’ve made this drive a million times.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: What’s that for?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: My half of the gas.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Keep it.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: What do you mean? Isn’t that how ride-sharing
works? – We split everything fifty-fifty?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: I don’t take money from friends.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: What the hell are you doing!?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Scenic detour.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: No way! Get back on the highway.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Relax, I checked it out on the map. It looks
interesting.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I mean it, get back on the highway right now!
This is not going to happen!</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Will you chill. It’s a shortcut. We’ll be back
on the highway before you know it.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Not many radio stations out here.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: We’re in a valley. FM radio waves travel in a
straight line. They can’t penetrate big obstacles like hills. Try
AM.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Where were you when I was flunking freshman
physics?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: So… Does your family do the whole traditional
Christmas thing?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: No, my grandparents are Dutch, so I was raised
on salted licorice and Sinterklaas…</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: How’s that different from the regular Santa
Claus?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Instead of the North Pole, he lives in Spain.
And instead of elves he’s got an enforcer named Black Pete. Basically
he’s like your Santa, only scarier.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Charming.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: What’s your Christmas like?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: My folks split my freshman year, so I spend
the holidays racing between them. Two trees… two turkey dinners…two sets
of presents to return for store credit. So normally I can deal, but this
year mom decided to rent a condo at the beach. Which is like, what? Two
hours away.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: I don’t know. The beach can be sort of nice in
the winter. Romantic.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: So were you a Rehobeth beach family or Stone
Harbor?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Stone Harbor.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: We always went to Rehobeth. Year in and year
out… Jesus, I’ve never been more bored in my life. I was always so
jealous of my friends who spent summers at the Jersey shore.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Me too.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Stone Harbor is the Jersey shore.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Hm? Oh, yeah, I know. What I meant was-</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: You aren’t from Delaware, are you?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Well, see, it’s kind of complicated-</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Who are you?!</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: I’m exactly who I said I was, am, it’s
just-</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: What the hell’s going on here?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Nothing’s going on-</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Look, just calm down. I can explain-</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: You think he doesn’t see us?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: How can he not?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Pull over and let this asshole by.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Over where? There’s no shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>brenda lee</strong>: Rockin’ around, the Christmas tree, at
the Christ-mas par-ty hop…</p>
<p><strong>brenda lee</strong>: Mistletoe hung where you can see, Ev’ry
couple tries to STOP. Rockin’ around, the Christmas tree, have a happy
hol-i-day… Later we’ll have some pumpkin pie, and do some car-
rol-ing…</p>
<p><strong>brenda lee</strong>: You will get a sen-ti-men-tal fee- ling
when you hear… Voices singing “Let’s be jolly, DECK the halls with
boughs of holly”…</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: He’s not stopping!</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Hold on!</p>
<p><strong>brenda lee</strong>: Rockin’ around, the Christmas tree, Have
a happy hol-i-day. Everyone’s dancing mer-ri-ly in the New. Old.
Fash-ioned. Wa-a-ay!</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: … please… please… please…</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: C-Calling 9-1-1. Or trying to.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Any luck?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Can’t… I can’t get a signal here.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: I don’t have a cell.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: How can you not have a cell?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: How’re you doing? You all right?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I… yeah, I’m okay. Nothing broken… What about
you?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: I don’t know. Think I hit my head.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Asshole who ran us off the road.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I don’t know. I guess maybe he decided just to
hit and run.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: So where are his tire tracks?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: In case you haven’t noticed, it’s coming down
pretty hard.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Yeah, but you can still see our tracks.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: This doesn’t make any sense…</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: What now?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: I guess we see how bad we’re stuck.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Ready?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Ready!</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Hey, open up.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Better get used to it, asshole.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: What the hell is wrong with you? What did I
do?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: You drove us here, that’s what you did!! What
the hell did you think you were doing!?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: I thought I was driving you home.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: You’re not driving me home because one, you
don’t live near my home and two, this piece of shit isn’t driving
anywhere. Now what are we doing here? Why did you get off the
highway?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: I told you, this is a shortcut. Anyway, you
were the one who said she was so bored on the highway. This used to be
called `Scenic 606’ because there’s an amazing view of the valley-</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: One, you’ve never been anywhere near here
before so don’t pretend you knew it’s a shortcut, and two, there’s an
amazing view of shit</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Let me get this straight. You think I
intentionally arranged for us get stranded out here?! It was an</p>
<p><strong>36 continued: 36</strong>: GUY</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Maybe! Maybe he’s like your Black Pete or
something! Why the hell did you tell me that story anyway?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: You’re crazy…</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Anyway, I’ve got news for you… I got through
to a friend’s voicemail while you were supposedly unconscious. I’m sure
she’s called the cops by now.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Would you listen to yourself? What kind of
psycho do you think I am?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: I’m gonna walk back to the gas station for
help. You’ve got the heater and the radio, so you should be all right
here. Though I really think you should consider coming with me.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I bet you do.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Fine. Whatever. If you feel a draft and you
want to patch this…</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I bet you do.</p>
<p><strong>radio psa</strong>: … The National Weather Service has issued
a Winter Storm Warning for the entire Eastern Seaboard…</p>
<p><strong>38 continued: 38</strong>: RADIO PSA</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Stay away from me!</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Whoa! Take it easy. What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: You! Everything! The guy-</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: What guy?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I don’t know, it was weird. I saw some guy
walking down the road.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Where did he go?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I don’t know. Into the woods.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Look. It’s freezing out here. Let’s just get in
the car and you can tell me what happened…</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: What are you doing back so soon? What about
hiking to the gas station?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: It was closed. I was going to leave a note, but
I didn’t… You know. Have anything to write with.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: But those places are supposed to stay open
24/7! Why wasn’t it open?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: How the hell should I know?! Independent
operator. Look, can we continue this conversation in the car, `cause I’m
freezing my balls off standing out here.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I’m not getting into the car with you, you
psycho!!!</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Fine. Whatever. I’m getting in. You’re welcome
to join me.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Relax.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: That’s not right. The clock…</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Huh? No, it’s not. It should read…</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: You’re bleeding.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: It’s nothing…</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: It doesn’t look like nothing.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Scalp wounds bleed a lot. Head wounds in
general. That’s why, if you’re ever in a bar fight, the thing to do is
pick up a bottle and smash the other guy across the bridge of his nose.
It’ll make his eyes fill with blood and snot, and buy you enough time to
run away.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: That’s really useful, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Place called Glens Falls…</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: That’s not in Delaware.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: That’s, like, in the complete opposite
direction!</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: That’s like twenty minutes from school!</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: All right, all right, so I lied… Obviously.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: I just thought you seemed cool. I don’t have a
line or a `game’ or whatever the hell it’s called. So when I saw a
chance to get you alone for six uninterrupted hours, I took it.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: But how did you know where I lived?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Asked around.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Which explains how you found out I was from
Delaware… But not how you knew I needed a ride home. I mean, I always
fly. How could you possibly know that for, like the</p>
<p><strong>40 continued: 40</strong>: GIRL</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Forgive me for attempting a romantic
gesture.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Romantic? Try stalkerish.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Not if things worked out between us…I would’ve
told you everything eventually, and then it wouldn’t be stalkerish. It
would just be this sweet funny story we’d have.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: We?!</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Okay, you’ve made your point! I’m a creep who
gets off on chauffeuring women under false pretenses. Can we drop this
already? Christ. I’m starving. You hungry?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: No. Oh, shit. I think I might’ve left it in
the parking lot.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I’m sorry. It was an accident-</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Shit! I spent sixty bucks on this gourmet crap
you like! Saint Andre’s cheese and Carr’s crackers and those stupid
little French pickles, I forget what they’re called-</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Cornichons… I love cornichons.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: I think I remember losing pack of Big Red down
the back seat cushions last week…</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Asshole.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Let go, goddamnit…</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Give them to me!</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: No!!!</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: I need these.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: I still can’t believe you left all our food in
a stupid parking lot.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Look, I’m sorry, okay? I’ll write you a check
for sixty bucks if it will make you get off my case. I don’t know what
else I can say.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Let’s just eat.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: You. Girls. Women. You seem cool at first.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: What the hell are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: You should all come with a warning, like car
mirrors: “Objects in belly shirts are flakier than they appear.”</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: You want to talk about fake? How about guys
who pretend to be from Delaware to meet girls?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: How about we just stop talking altogether.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: That’s perfect. Because now that I’m not some
Nietzche-spouting sexbot, suddenly I’m not worth knowing. And who’s
fault is that?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Gas.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Oh shit.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Fuel tank must’ve been ruptured in the
accident.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Can you fix it?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Not unless you have a welding rig in all that
shit of yours. And even if you did, it wouldn’t matter. We’re out of
gas.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: But we still have the battery, right?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: As long as we use it sparingly, it should last
the night. Question is, will we?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: No engine… no heat.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Layers…</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: But I didn’t bring anything.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Ah, Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I’m sorry, but who could prepare for something
like this?! I’ve got a complete winter wardrobe, it’s just in Delaware…
And no, that doesn’t make me a flake!</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I’m freezing. I can’t feel my toes.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Me neither.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Dream on.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Gotta pee.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Why didn’t you go before, when we were
outside?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Because it’s freezing out. We’re talking about
an arctic air mass out of Canada.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: It’s still freezing out-</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Yeah, but now I’ve got to go. Promise not to
look.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: What?! What happened?!</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: - Did you see? - They were right here! -</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Why didn’t you stop them?! Maybe they have a
phone!</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Where’d they go?!</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: There!</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Gotta - just a sec - catch my -</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Maybe we should go back to the car.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: No! There must be a house or something. Keep
going. I’ll catch up.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Hello? Hello?</p>
<p><strong>stranger</strong>: …please, officer, please don’t…</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Wait!</p>
<p><strong>stranger</strong>: …don’t put me in the river…</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Oh my god! Who did this to you?!</p>
<p><strong>stranger</strong>: …please, officer, just take the booze and
let me go…</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: It’s okay! You’re okay! It’s okay!</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: What happened to you!? This looks like… oh
jesus… like frostbite!</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I tried to… touch him…it burns.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Where’d these come from?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: There’s the ruins of an old house or something
back in the woods.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Oh… Give me the duct tape…</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Are you awake?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Uh-huh. D-Don’t want to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Because I’m afraid I won’t wake up. That’s
what they say happens. When</p>
<p><strong>58 continued: 58</strong>: GIRL</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: There are worse ways to go.</p>
<p><strong>highway patrolman</strong>: Everything all right in
there?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Thank God! You don’t know how glad we are to
see you…</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: …you won’t believe what’s been happening…</p>
<p><strong>highway patrolman</strong>: Having car trouble, huh?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Someone ran us off the road.</p>
<p><strong>highway patrolman</strong>: There’s no parking here.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: What are you talking about? We’re not parking
here. Didn’t you hear what she said? Someone ran us off-</p>
<p><strong>highway patrolman</strong>: …Of course I might be willing to
let you off with a warning this time… if we can come to some sort of
arrangement…</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: What are you talking ab-</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: It’s a shake-down. He’s probably partners with
the guy who ran us off the road. Wouldn’t be surprised if he has a deal
with the tow guy, too.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: You think this whole thing was a scam? Jesus,
he could’ve killed us!</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: How much cash do you have on you?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: This is all we have.</p>
<p><strong>highway patrolman</strong>: Some weather we’re having…</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Yeah, it’s really coming down. So what do you
say? How `bout a little Christmas spirit here?</p>
<p><strong>highway patrolman</strong>: You know, this is one bad stretch
of road. All kinds of trouble going on up here: Kids drag racing.
Niggers hauling booze across the state lines. Lady drivers breaking
down, no-one ever hears from them again…</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: We just want to get out of here, so if you
could just-</p>
<p><strong>highway patrolman</strong>: Let me tell you, I’ve seen a lot
of fatalities on this road…</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I think maybe I just want to go back-</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>highway patrolman</strong>: Get in the damn patrol car…</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Please… just let us go…</p>
<p><strong>highway patrolman</strong>: Hurry up…we’ve got an
audience…</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: But we didn’t do anything! Please! We won’t
tell anybody if you let us-</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Get away from her you bastard!</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: What just… out there…?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: But it did happen, right? Or not…</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Do it.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Frostbite, second and third-degree.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: How do you know? You take a first aid course or
something?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Ski camp, seventh grade… Don’t make fun. What
else do you have going on when you’re thirteen?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: I’m kinda not in the mood anymore.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: We have to rewarm your hands. You have ice
crystals in your blood. If we don’t get circulation restored you could
lose your fingers.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: What do you mean? You were there.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I know, but who was he? Where’d he go? It’s
like one minute there’s a, a gun to my head and the next all the lights
go out and he’s gone, like a, like a-</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Ghost.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Yes. And the old guys we chased-</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: What then? How do you explain-</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I don’t know! This is crazy! I can’t be having
this conversation.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: You’re having it.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I don’t want to!</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: You think I do?! Jesus. I’m just as freaked by
what’s happening as you. But we have to deal with it, `cause like it or
not, it is happening…</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Then how do we make it stop?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: I don’t know. They don’t cover this in
Philosophy 101.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: What about that book, in the back?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: What book?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Something Book of the Dead.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Tibetan. It’s not a How-to manual. It’s an 8th
century Buddhist guide on death and dying.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: God. Why is this happening to us?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: I can feel your stomach rumbling.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I know. God, I’d give anything for some of
those Carr’s crackers right now…</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Um, let’s see. Duck liver pat� with
truffles.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Oh no…</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Some olives, the normal kind and also some of
the little shrivelled black ones. A bottle of white wine…</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Mmmmm…</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: And for dessert, anisette biscotti and a
thermos of espresso.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Ohhhh…</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Can’t be too much longer until dawn. Someone’s
bound to come along then. A snowplow or something. Right?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: How are your hands?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Starting to burn…</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: That’s good. It means the circulation’s coming
back.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Yeah, but I mean really burn…</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Hang on. I think I have a few
Tylenol-with-codeine in my purse.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: What’s taking so long, nurse -</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I just-</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Priests!</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: “… Hearing the crash on nearby Route 606, they
braved inclement weather to administer Last Rights…”</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: That must be what we saw them doing!</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: “… also killed was State Highway Patrolman…
continued on page seven.”</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: You got that Tylenol?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Coming.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I’ll go first. You get some sleep.</p>
<p><strong>brenda lee</strong>: Rockin’ around, the Christmas tree, at
the Christ-mas par-ty hop.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Thank god! You were having some kind of seizure
or someth-</p>
<p><strong>brenda lee</strong>: You will get a sen-ti-men-tal fee- ling
when you hear… Voices singing “Let’s be jolly, DECK the halls with
boughs of holly”…</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: What’s happening!?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: It’s him! Hurry! Help me!</p>
<p><strong>brenda lee</strong>: Rockin’ around, the Christmas tree, Have
a happy hol-i-day…</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: I think… he’s gone. I guess when he couldn’t
get in he gave up. I told you these `88 Olds were built like tanks!</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Shhh! How do you know it’s not a trick! He
could still be out there waiting-</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: He’s not! Listen!</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: But what if he comes back..?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: We just have to stay in the car until morning.
Then we’ll be safe. That can’t be more than, like, a few more hours…
Someone’s bound to come along once the sun comes up… Someone human I
mean. Think you can hold on until then?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: What if, you know. We have to pee?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: We can use the empty water bottles. From this
point on, the back seat is a co-ed bathroom. Sound like a plan?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I don’t want to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I gotta pee…</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Again?!</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Stop talking.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: You should ask Santa to bring you a bigger
bladder.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I’m serious! It’s hard enough doing this in
front of you.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: What, are you one of those people who can’t pee
with the bathroom door open?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: No. But it’s not something I usually do until
much later in a relationship…</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: No big deal. Just your average day in the
NHL…</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: How long have you known?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Since I tried hiking back to the gas station.
You were right, I never got anywhere near it. I</p>
<p><strong>69 continued: 69</strong>: GUY</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Why didn’t you tell me?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: I didn’t want to scare you-</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: We’ve got to get you some help now. You won’t
make it to morning. I’m going to try and hike back to the gas
station-</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: How far do you think you’d get out there before
running into Mr. Freeze?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I’m not going to just sit here and watch you
die!</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: What are you looking at?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Telephone poles. They must have a junction box
or something to test the lines … There! See that one?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: So maybe there’s some way I can… I don’t know…
jack into it or something. Try and call for help.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: You want to climb a telephone pole?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Of course I don’t want to! But it’s got rungs.
Can’t be any harder than the climbing wall at my gym. Big fat repair
guys do it all the time, right? Right?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: But you’re forgetting one thing…</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: He’s out there.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: The song! That old Christmas song on the
radio. It always comes on just before he shows up…</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: I’ve been thinking…</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: What about?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Eternal recurrence. Maybe it wouldn’t be so
bad.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: What wouldn’t?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Repeating this life. Over and over. Exactly the
same each time.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Even the last twenty-four hours?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Know what I’d do different? Next time I’d just
to walk up to you after class… and say “Hey.”</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: You should. Definitely. Do that.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Don’t let me die out here-</p>
<p><strong>radio psa</strong>: The State Weather Bureau has issued an
extreme cold warning…</p>
<p><strong>radio psa</strong>: …Residents of Carbon County are advised
to seek shelter as sub-zero temperatures produce wind chills in excess
of twenty below…</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: No!!!</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Nine-one-one emergency response.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Thank god! Hi! Hello! We need help!</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: What’s that? Can you repeat-</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: We’re on highway 606! Oh god, please hurry! We
need help! My friend is hurt-</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Can you repeat your-</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Hello? Hello?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: - I did it - got through - but I don’t know
how much she understood - the operator I mean -</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Sorry… sorry… I’m sorry…</p>
<p><strong>snowplow driver</strong>: You kids okay?</p>
<p><strong>snowplow driver</strong>: Dispatch, come in…</p>
<p><strong>dispatch</strong>: Go ahead…</p>
<p><strong>snowplow driver</strong>: I’m out at the site of that
reported accident on 606. One of them didn’t make it. I’m taking the
other directly to the trauma unit in Hadleyville.</p>
<p><strong>dispatch</strong>: Copy that.</p>
<p><strong>snowplow driver</strong>: Been some real bad accidents on
this road over the years. When I was growing up, there was a family from
New York City found out here froze solid-</p>
<p><strong>snowplow driver</strong>: … fire department had to hose them
down with hot water for two hours to thaw them out. I remember back in
high school there was a stupid rumor going around if you went driving
out here on moonless nights and looked up in your rearview, you might
see the dead baby in your backseat …</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: What about those ruins up on the hill? The
retirement home for old priests?</p>
<p><strong>snowplow driver</strong>: Tragic story. Winter of `61 they
were all found froze to death in their beds…</p>
<p><strong>snowplow driver</strong>: Must’ve been a pilot on the boiler
went out, or something…</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: It’s not Tom…</p>
<p><strong>snowplow driver</strong>: Doesn’t this stupid son of a gun
realize we’re bigger than him?! No way he’s going to win this fight!</p>
<p><strong>snowplow driver</strong>: Hang on, officer, I’m coming…</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: No!!!</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Wait! Don’t go down there! Stop!</p>
<p><strong>snowplow driver</strong>: Hang on, officer! We’ll get you
out!</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: No!!! Don’t go near it!!!</p>
<p><strong>snowplow driver</strong>: What!!? We have to get him out of
there…</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Doesn’t matter! He’s already dead!</p>
<p><strong>snowplow driver</strong>: What the hell are you talking
about?</p>
<p><strong>highway patrolman</strong>: Should’ve known you vultures
would turn up…</p>
<p><strong>snowplow driver</strong>: Try not to move, officer, you might
have a neck injury.</p>
<p><strong>highway patrolman</strong>: What are you waiting for, a
letter from the Bishop?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Come on. We can go now. It’s over.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Come on, come on!</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Get away from her, you bastard!</p>
<p><strong>cellphone</strong>: Ding-da-da DING, da-DING da-DING…</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Wait!</p>
<p><strong>guy’s ghost</strong>: …I would’ve told you everything
eventually…</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>guy’s ghost</strong>: …then it wouldn’t be stalkerish.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I know!</p>
<p><strong>guy’s ghost</strong>: … It would just be this sweet funny
story we’d have…</p>
