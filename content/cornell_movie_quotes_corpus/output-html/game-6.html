<p><strong>int. loft apartment - manhattan - morning</strong>: 1 1</p>
<p><strong>lone eagle</strong>: Traffic flowing smoothly on the</p>
<p><strong>ext. loft building 2</strong>: teven’s loft is in an old
squat building on 47th Street near</p>
<p><strong>lone eagle</strong>: Another day of traffic. Traffic
everywhere I look. Cars stop and move and stop again. People sit at the
wheel thinking their thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>ext. united nations plaza apts - - morning</strong>: 3</p>
<p><strong>lone eagle</strong>: Day in, day out. Red light, green light.
Traffic on the major arteries and traffic in the little veins.</p>
<p><strong>lone eagle</strong>: Cars, vans, taxis, trucks, limos,
Mopeds, bikes and buses. Emergency vehicles screaming and wailing. Birth
and death, walk and don’t walk.</p>
<p><strong>lone eagle</strong>: Traffic yesterday, today and tomorrow.
Bumper to bumper, soul to soul. This is Lone Eagle over and out.</p>
<p><strong>ext. 47th street and first avenue - a little later</strong>:
4 4</p>
<p><strong>int. taxi</strong>: 5 5</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I used to drive a taxi.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Where you’re going, mister?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I used to drive a taxi.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: I used to be head of neurosurgery. Big
hospital in USSR. This hospital, I’m not kidding.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Very big.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: I opened thousands of brains.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: What did you find?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Big mess every time.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I loved my taxi. Went twelve hours nonstop.
Stopped only to pee. I peed under the Manhattan bridge. Peed many times
in parks and playgrounds.</p>
<p><strong>ext. street corner</strong>: 6 6</p>
<p><strong>int. foyer</strong>: 7 7</p>
<p><strong>int. buchanan apartment - seconds later</strong>: 8 8</p>
<p><strong>t</strong>: he edge of the bedroom. Nicky is crawling into
the room and Joanna is hanging on to him, being dragged. They are fully
dressed except for one of Joanna’s shoes.</p>
<p><strong>int. hallway</strong>: 9 9</p>
<p><strong>int. bedroom – later</strong>: 10 10</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Last night. Alan Albright called me a
handsome woman. Second time he’s done that. Son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I hear Alan’s sick.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Alan’s very sick. He has to go to New Mexico
and sit in a lukewarm solution.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: You know about Adele.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: What about her?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: She’s dying.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: She died.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I talked to her two days ago.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Apparently it didn’t help. You know about
Peter, of course.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Our Peter?</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Peter Redmond. They found out why he can’t
remember his lines. There’s something living in his brain. A parasite he
picked up in Borneo, doing the movie.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Can he get through it?</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: They’re watching him closely. There’s a
special rehearsal set for this afternoon. To bolster his confidence. And
that’s not all.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I’ve got bigger problems, Joanna. Personal
problems.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: That’s not all, Nicky. I’ve been backing
your plays for fifteen years. And I’ve never been more depressed.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>s</strong>: teven Schwimmer. The most powerful critic in
America gets his first crack at Nicky Rogan.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Look. All I want is a haircut. I’m not
worried about this guy.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Ever since he started reviewing the Broadway
theater, nobody in this business has been worried about anything
else.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: They can send their heartless brilliant
boy-critic. There’s a much bigger thing going on than tonight’s
opening.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: The Red Sox</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: You mean the World Series? I thought the Red
Sox were winning.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Three games to two. But if you know their
history, you realize there’s a tragedy in the making. I’ve been carrying
this franchise on my back since I was six years old.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: It can’t be all that personal.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: If you have a team you’ve followed all your
life, and they raise your hopes and crush them, and lift them and crush
them, do you want me to tell you what it’s like? It’s like feeling your
childhood die over and over. J</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: I mean Nicky, really, no.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: I’m proud of this play. It’s so different
from anything you’ve done.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: This is how we’ve managed to last.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: We’re able to surprise each other.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: In and out of bed.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Because we’re completely mismatched.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: We don’t even like each other, do we?</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: I used to tell myself. Talent is more erotic
when it’s wasted. Will I see you tonight?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: The Red Sox blow a chance to win their first
World Series since 1918. You expect me to miss that for an opening
night?</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: It makes me so mad. Steven Schwimmer ready
to strike. The exterminating angel.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: It’s all worked out. They’ll lose tonight.
Then they’ll lose tomorrow. I see it with stunning clarity.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: It’s your best play, Nicky.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: They’ll lose because they’re my team.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: He will absolutely hate it.</p>
<p><strong>int. taxi</strong>: 12 12</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I wrapped my sandwiches in tinfoil. I ate and
drove. I had one of those big checkered cabs.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: You are going where?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Crosstown.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Very bad today.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I cleaned out the ashtrays religiously.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: I am sitting here five years in traffic. It
is one continuous traffic since I arrive. Why must it be?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Laurel, stay there. Keep the meter running.
And try to stay abreast.</p>
<p><strong>int. second taxi</strong>: 13 13</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I never see you anymore. Where are you all
day?</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: I go to college. I thought you knew.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Do you want to get some coffee?</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: I don’t drink coffee, Daddy. And this is not
what we should be talking about.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: What do you want to talk about? I’ll talk
about anything. What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: I’m seeing your play tonight, remember?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Why do you need a radio?</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: So at the intermission I can listen to the
ball game. Do you know that mother is seeing a prominent divorce
lawyer?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: That’s completely crazy.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Is it?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Don’t talk like that. How prominent? What are
you implying?</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: She’s doing like those Iranians. `I divorce
thee. I divorce thee. I divorce thee’</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: And he hears it the same time I hear it? What
happened to family secrets?</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Mother is totally, you know, upset.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Abulhassas, we’ll be getting out here.</p>
<p><strong>ext. the street</strong>: 14 14</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Nicky, you don’t come in for a while.
Everything’s okay?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Hello George. You’re so healthy and
thick-bodied I want to punch you in the chest. This is my daughter
Laurel. Just to hear the sound it makes.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I saw your picture in the paper. Two
papers.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: That means they’re getting ready to kill
me.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: That’s not what I hear. I have four, five
actors working here. `His best play since “Yessiree Bob” I’m telling
you, they say it.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: He doesn’t want to hear it.</p>
<p><strong>int. coffee shop - later</strong>: 16 16</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: If lawyers for the mob are called
controversial, why are divorce lawyers called prominent?</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Because they get outstanding settlements.
And Mother is determined that this time there’s no turning back.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I just had breakfast with her. She didn’t say
a word about this.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Because you refuse to believe she’s serious.
You’ve always refused.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Don’t be so steely-eyed. It’s that course
you’re taking in criminology.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Oh please. Not now. She wants you to stop
seeing What’s- Her-Name. Finally. Now and forever. Do you think that’s
too much to ask? For a wife of nineteen years.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: You’re too young to be studying criminal
behavior. It’s making you obsessive.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: She is kicking you out.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Your mother and I have something between us
that’s too strong to damage permanently. Believe me, I know this. That’s
right, nineteen years. And what about the days and minutes? Sharing
small moments, sharing memories, raising a beautiful child. We’re wedded
in the deepest and strongest ways. Lillian isn’t only my wife. She’s my
best friend.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Bullshit, Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>int. coffee shop - near the cash register - later</strong>:
17 17</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Mother won’t tell me how long you’ve been
seeing this person. She’s embarrassed to tell me. So why don’t you tell
me?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Don’t call her Mother all the time. It makes
her sound tragic and unforgiving. What happened to Mom?</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: I didn’t turn her into Mother. You did.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: This person and I are a thing of the total
past. I promise you.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Know what Mother said to me? Daddy’s demons
are so intense he doesn’t even know he’s lying.</p>
<p><strong>ext. the street</strong>: 18 18</p>
<p><strong>int. taxi</strong>: 19 19</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: It’s life, it’s taxis. People trying to make
contacts, make deals, meet their lovers. Taxis are sexy. You can’t have
Manhattan without taxis. I was proud of my taxi. I kept my taxi
clean.</p>
<p><strong>int. bank</strong>: 20 20</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Nicky. I was thinking about you. I went to
the preview last night.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I don’t want to hear about it.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: A lovely piece of theater. Small but
important.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Shut up, Elliot.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Quietly effective.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: You’re an artist. I’m a craftsman.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Press a button and they give us money.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Ride with me. We need a haircut.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: How is Lillian? I haven’t seen her.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: She wants a divorce.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Don’t talk like that.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: It’s over, finished and done with.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: That sounds so final. But are we really
surprised?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I’m completely stunned. I don’t want this to
happen.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: But didn’t we know it would happen?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Don’t needle me, Elliot. Tell me how bad you
feel. We’re suppose to feel bad together. This is what friends do.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Joanna Bourne. So rich and crisp. This woman
lets you touch her body? You put your hands on her personal parts?</p>
<p><strong>ext. the street</strong>: 22 22 2</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: We must abandon.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: What do you mean, we must abandon?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Ruptured steam pipe.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Ruptured steam pipe.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Asbestos lining. Do not inhale.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: We must abandon.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Contaminated substance. Very dangerous.
Shooting mud.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Do not inhale.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: We must abandon.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Ruptured steam pipe.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Very dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Asbestos lining.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: We must abandon.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Do not inhale.</p>
<p><strong>int. restaurant - later</strong>: 5 25</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I’m trying to think. When did you start
looking so terrible? You look awful.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: I can tell you the year, the day, the night,
the minute.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: You used to love life. You don’t exude this
any more.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: What do I exude?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Suffering. You exude a person who sits in a
small dark apartment eating soft white bread.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Tonight you find out what it means to
suffer.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Tonight. What’s tonight?</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Shit. They don’t have any carrot soup.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: You mean because What’s-His-Name.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: You will suffer because he is in the
theater. And you will suffer a thousandfold when his review appears.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: It’s just a review.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: It is just a review. Do not inhale. Very
dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: What’s the fuss? I don’t get it.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: That’s what I said eighteen months ago.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: What happened eighteen months ago?</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Before his Broadway days. He reviewed the
one-act I did at the Fulton Fish Market. We did this play at four AM,
outdoors in the rain. One performance. For the fish handlers.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: And he was there?</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Steven Schwimmer. I memorized every word of
this review.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: That’s awful.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: I recite it to myself with masochistic
relish.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: A year and a half later? You’re still
brooding?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Yessirree Bob! Yessisree Bob!</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: You don’t know about obscure writers, Nicky.
How we have our anger to nurture and love. Our murderous fantasies for
any amount of fame, money , power and sex.</p>
<p><strong>paisley</strong>: Guys ready to order?</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Paisley Porter. I didn’t know you were
waiting tables.</p>
<p><strong>paisley</strong>: Elliot?</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: This is a great young out-of-work
actress.</p>
<p><strong>aisley</strong>: Elliot Litvak. Have you been ill? And
Mr. Rogan. How nice.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: What’s good?</p>
<p><strong>paisley</strong>: We have a very nice pasta today. Alla
Putanesca.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Say it again.</p>
<p><strong>paisley</strong>: Alla puttanesca.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Isn’t she great? What did I tell you? A
talent.</p>
<p><strong>int. restaurant - later - same table</strong>: 26 26 2</p>
<p><strong>ext. street</strong>: 7 27</p>
<p><strong>int. steven schwimmer’s loft</strong>: 28 28</p>
<p><strong>s</strong>: teven is sitting on a mat in the tub, arms in the
air and folded so that his fists are close to his ears. He is in lotus
position, breathing in serious meditation – a deep intake of breath
followed by a softer expulsion, matching the beat of the dripping
faucet.</p>
<p><strong>int. restaurant - main room - later</strong>: 29 29</p>
<p><strong>first man</strong>: I got a good feeling about tonight</p>
<p><strong>second man</strong>: We got Ojeda going. He pitched beautiful
last time out.</p>
<p><strong>first man</strong>: Plus Darryl’s due for a big game.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I hate the Mets.</p>
<p><strong>second man</strong>: How come?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: When the Mets lose, they just lose. It’s a
flat feeling. But the Red Sox – here we have a rich history of
interesting ways to lose a crucial game. Defeats that keep you awake,
that pound in your head like the hammer of fate.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: You can analyze a Red Sox defeat day and
night for a month and still uncover layers of complex feelings - -
feelings you didn’t know you were capable of. The pain has a memory all
of it’s own.</p>
<p><strong>ext. shea stadium</strong>: 30 30</p>
<p><strong>int. shea stadium - locker room</strong>: 31 31 3 names
Henderson, Stanley, Buckner.</p>
<p><strong>int. the men’s room - a little later</strong>: 2 32</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: `One thing saves Elliot Litvak’s work from
complete mediocrity, and this is his lack of ambition.’</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: It gets funnier.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: It gets funnier. See, Nicky? They chart the
laughs. This from a critic who lives like a fallen monk. Whose address
is a carefully guarded secret.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: A critic who has to disguise himself.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: To go to the theater. Wears I don’t know
what. Make-up, padding.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Because he is so deeply hated by so many
people in the business.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: He has to disguise himself, Nicky.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: For his own safety and peace of mind.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Do you want me to tell you what it was like,
reading that review at the newstand with trucks rumbling past and street
vendors facing Mecca?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: What was it like?</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: I said, `I’m dead’. He killed me.</p>
<p><strong>int. restaurant -later</strong>: 33 33</p>
<p><strong>p</strong>: aisley eating lunch at the end of the long table,
looking up to see Nicky approach with liqueur and a glass on wine. He
sits opposite her, placing the wineglass in front of her.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: You’ve worked with Elliot?</p>
<p><strong>paisley</strong>: I was in the fish-market play. What
happened to him?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: There was a review.</p>
<p><strong>paisley</strong>: I think I remember.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: So does Elliot.</p>
<p><strong>paisley</strong>: Not one of Steven’s finer moments.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Oh. You know him.</p>
<p><strong>paisley</strong>: A little.</p>

spike.</p>

<p><strong>elliot</strong>: The man has taken over my mind. He’s not
only out there. He’s in my head and I can’t get rid of him. I can’t
write a word without imagining his response. I’m paralyzed as an
artist.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I don’t have the problems that artists
have.</p>
<p><strong>lliot</strong>: You’ve been saying that for years.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: `I’m just a professional. A dues- playing
member of a guild.’ Because you’re afraid, Nicky. That’s the darkest
part of you. You don’t think you’re good enough.</p>

children. Glued to the shadows.</p>

Battled constantly with my brother and sister. Here I am, world.</p>

<p><strong>nicky</strong>: So do I. Over and over.</p>
<p><strong>paisley</strong>: Peter Redmond is an actor I admire
enormously.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Would you like to meet him?</p>
<p><strong>paisley</strong>: He doesn’t want to meet some out-of- work
ingenue.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I’m trying to prolong our afternoon. In case
you haven’t noticed.</p>

<p><strong>paisley</strong>: Is what true?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: He wears a disguise.</p>
<p><strong>paisley</strong>: Steven goes to extremes to protect his
privacy. No friends. No phone.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: But you’re his friend.</p>
<p><strong>paisley</strong>: Sort of. Sometimes. You’re not building an
obsession about Steven, are you? Look. I understand opening- night
jitters, but you’ve got one of the great actors in American theater
starring in your play.</p>

<p><strong>sidney</strong>: I had lunch with Joanna. She said she told
you about Peter. You weren’t concerned, she said.</p>

<p><strong>sidney</strong>: So what happened since? You’re worried about
this kid who writes these reviews?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: ’m not worried about this kid.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Well I am. Worried sick. Everybody quotes
Steven Schwimmer. He’s here to announce the death of civilization. He
kills a play every time he farts.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Postpone. We have every right.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Too late. All the elements are in place.
Delay the opening and we lose the theater.</p>

<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Yes, Peter.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: But my parasite is consuming all the new
memories. Eating my lines.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: You have to see the words. Try to build a
mental picture of the script. Imagine your lines high- lighted with a
felt tip pen.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What color?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: What was your favorite color crayon, growing
up?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Burnt sienna.</p>

<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Yes.</p>

I can get past this line. I think I can handle the last long speech.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: Which line, Peter?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: The Son says to the Father, This could be
it.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: And the Father replies?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: That’s the line I can’t ever, for the life of
me remember. I just can’t get it.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It’s the same line. The Father simply repeats
what the Son says to him.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: This could be it.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: This could be it.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I know it sounds easy. But something happens

it.</p>

who uses his oddness to get laid. Is that our Steven?</p>
<p><strong>paisley</strong>: If I’m sleeping with him, and I haven’t
said I am, then so what?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: So everything. That’s so what. So I begin to
hate him. So I want to do him grave harm.</p>
<p><strong>paisley</strong>: But you don’t even know me. How can you
care what I do with whom?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I know you both. Enough. How much knowledge
does it take before a man does something crazy.</p>

would one day.</p>
<p><strong>paisley</strong>: I haven’t come to you.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: But you’re here. So you must have come to
me.</p>
<p><strong>paisley</strong>: In other words I never understood until
today how much pain and anxiety you’ve been causing with your reviews.
Steven, it’s so unfair.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Of course it’s unfair. The truth is always
unfair. Why do you think I live this way? Hiding out. Stealing
electricity from a lamp post. Because people who write the truth are
outcasts of society. I can’t live openly, in a nice clean doorman
building, with my name on the mailbox. They’d come after me in
packs.</p>
<p><strong>paisley</strong>: Not if you stopped hurting people. Write
the truth gently.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: The truth is never gentle. Listen to me
carefully. Each of us lives in the thinnest possible wrapping of wishes
and dreams. Truth is the force that penetrates this wispy skin. It hurts
and maims. Look how they hate me for telling the truth. It’s an
education, Paisley. The College of Raw Nerves.</p>
<p><strong>paisley</strong>: Yes. I’ve seen your victims. One past and
one future. I thought I might convince you to reconsider.</p>

wants me.</p>

interfere with tradition?</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Rogan, Laurel. You also have a Rogan,
Lillian. She won’t need it. Sell it.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Take it yourself. Take a date.</p>
<p><strong>aurel</strong>: I don’t have a date. I don’t want a date.</p>

Let’s talk.</p>

Windex.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: I was barrister in Kenya. I said to him, get
off from here. I cannot drive with your body on my windscreen.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I drove twelve hours straight through. Ate at
the wheel.</p>
<p><strong>river</strong>: You have to eat at the wheel. You cannot get
anywhere.</p>

continue. Where do you pee, Ibrahmin?</p>

<p><strong>michael</strong>: If it’s you, what are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I’m on my way to get a haircut.</p>
<p><strong>ichael</strong>: Where does Nicky get his hair cut?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Across Ninth Avenue. Dodgie’s. Where you’ve
been getting your hair cut for fifty years. Where Uncle Billy and Uncle
Marty got their hair cut. Where Jim Rorty shot a man for cheating at
poker.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: It was rummy, not poker. But I’ll take a
chance and let you in.</p>
<p><strong>int. michael rogan’s kitchen - later</strong>: 58 58</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: It’s a constant shock to me, how small this
place is. How did we do it? Five people in these little rooms.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Get yourself something to eat.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: We must have been heroic.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Five’s not so many. There were families
with seven kids. A grandmother. A dimwit uncle.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Lillian says it once a week. `Why doesn’t he
come live with us?’</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: You know the answer to that.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I do know the answer to that. Why don’t we
watch the ball game later? We’ll go to Mannion’s.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: They’re only gonna lose.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Of course they’re gonna lose. We’ll watch
them lose. What good is heartbreak if we don’t experience it
firsthand?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: The Red Sox are your problem. I never
understood about you and the Red Sox. Everybody rooted for the
Yankees.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Remember 1949? Last two games of the season.
Against the Yankees. The Sox lost on Saturday. Then they lost on Sunday.
First I cried for twenty-four hours. Then I had fist- fights the rest of
the week.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: It’s one thing for kids. You get older, you
Nhave other things.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: It’s all connected, Pop. It’s one life.
Baseball is memory. How do fathers and sons show their love? They go to
a ball game together. Thirty-five years later, they sit in the kitchen
and remember.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: But the son is suppose to stop crying.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I could have grown up happy. A Yankee fan. A
divorce lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: You’ll need these. Tonight. For the play.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Don’t make me sit through one of your
plays.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Hey, Pop. I know you don’t like the commotion
of opening night. But I especially want you to see this play. It’s new
territory for me. And for you too. I have to know what you think.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Since when did that matter?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Let’s not start that again.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: My back is killing me.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Where’s your elastic brace?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I can’t find it.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: You’re suppose to wear it when your back
gives you trouble.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I lost it. I lose everything.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I’ll go get you another one. You have to wear
it.</p>

<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I know, Pop.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I’m lucky they don’t knock down the
building. It could happen anytime. And everything worth remembering is
right here.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I think the building’s okay. At least for the
time being.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: You didn’t think it was okay when you lived
here. You wanted to get out so fast I thought you were running a
marathon.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Normal boy’s ambition. I like coming back.
You know that.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: You tell your friends your father used to
work the docks. Callused hands. But you had an attitude when you were
growing up that wasn’t easy for your mother and me to understand.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I was in a hurry to do big things, make big
mistakes. Any mistakes were okay as long as it was big. But I’m trying
to see these things clearly and honestly. That’s the play they’re going
to kill starting tonight. There’s a guy out there getting ready to rip
it apart. And that’s us. Who we were and where we come from.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: So what are you going to do about it?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: What do you want me to do?</p>

<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I used to carry a gun when I drove a cab.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Where is it?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I gave it away. I thought, I’m a writer
now.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: That was a big mistake.</p>
<p><strong>dodgie</strong>: You should never be without a gun. In this
city?</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: If he carries a gun, you have to carry a
gun.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: We’re making too much of this.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: No, we’re not.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I’m not a lonely spooky writer like you.
Nursing a hundred grudges. I’m a man who loves life.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: We’re talking about something deeper than
grudges. How do we respond to personal attack?</p>
<p><strong>dodgie</strong>: In this city? And you don’t carry a gun?</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: How do we maintain our dignity and
self-respect?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: In other words why should we suffer silently
at this kind of abuse? The man is out there ruining lives.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: It’s your best play, Nicky.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: He’ll hate it.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: He’ll kill it. He’ll write a review so
devastating it will shatter your career and cause the most unmanageable
psychic grief. What happens to your apartment on the East River? Your
house in Connecticut, where you watch things grow.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: We were thinking of putting in a pool.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: `The most interesting thing about Elliot
Litvak is that he writes the way he looks – fuzzy, grubby and
shifty-eyed.’ I’m telling you as a friend.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: There are things that speak to us from the
past.</p>
<p><strong>dodgie</strong>: In this city you don’t walk five feet out
the door and there is somebody trying to take what’s yours.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Your truth is locked in your past. Find it.
Know it for what it is. Shoot him, Nicky.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Shoot him.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: The American theater doesn’t need people
like that.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Shoot him, Nicky. Not that we really mean it.
But where does he live?</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Keep going west. Last building before the
river.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: How do you Eknow.</p>
<p><strong>lliot</strong>: Paisley Porter.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: About an hour and a half ago. I saw her come
out of a place. She said she was visiting a friend. But she wouldn’t
tell me who.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Had to be him.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: She was very evasive.</p>

Rhode Island.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Oh yeah?</p>
<p><strong>toyota</strong>: Matthew, look at him. When I lived in
Roxbury, the media followed this man everywhere. He was bigger than ten
movie stars. Where’s your white Lincoln limo?</p>

<p><strong>toyota</strong>: The most charming gangster in New England.
Where are we going, Mr. Lazzaro?</p>

going nowhere.</p>

<p><strong>toyota</strong>: Matthew’s my grandson.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: A grandmother. God bless you.</p>
<p><strong>toyota</strong>: He does bless me, each and every day.
Matthew’s mother works a hospital shift, so I pick him up at school. We
stop for a meal usually around this time. He does his homework and gets
some experience meeting people. But we never had a famous mobster
before.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: It’s the kid’s lucky day.</p>
<p><strong>toyota</strong>: This is one charming crook. If shooting
people is charming.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Now that’s a complicated subject.</p>
<p><strong>toyota</strong>: That’s a simple subject.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Look, we’re stuck here front and back. It’s

baseball.</p>

<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I respect a kid who does his homework in a
taxi. But let’s put a lid on the questions.</p>
<p><strong>toyota</strong>: Go on, tell him. Tell the truth. Tell him
how you feel, shooting a piece of hot metal in somebody’s flesh who was
once a child, who was once the same age as this boy. Somebody’s flesh
who was innocent once.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: It’s complicated. It’s a whole life. A person
doesn’t commit an act of violence out of nowhere. There are strong
forces at work.</p>

alive.</p>
<p><strong>toyota</strong>: An how many years does it take a person to
make his family safe and secure and happy, and then in one dumb moment,
what does he do?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I don’t know Toyota. What does he do?</p>
<p><strong>toyota</strong>: And the people he hurts the most are the
people who love him. Despite who he is and what he does for a living.
We’re always saying we want to take control of our lives. You don’t want
to take control. You want to lose control. Jesus knows it.</p>

let you know what’s been going on before you read about it in a gossip
column.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: We stranded five runners in the first two
innings. This will come back to haunt us.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: I want to be fair-minded, Nicky.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: All right. What’s been going on?</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: I’ve been talking to a prominent divorce
lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: How prominent?</p>

<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Who the hell cares?</p>

advantage of your patience and understanding. You understand me.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: That’s always been my problem.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: And you’ve been extremely patient.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: You know why, don’t you? Because I am
patient, chain-smoking Lillian.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: You smoked because I smoked. We were falling
in love, remember? I used to see certain movies only because you had
seen them. I wanted to see what you saw.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: I’d forgotten that.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I went because you went. You smoked because I
smoked.</p>

you?</p>

<p><strong>lillian</strong>: She’s my gynecologist.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I am really, deeply sorry.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: It violates so many trusts.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: It was an animal thing. No real intimacy.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: I never thought of Dr. Wetzel as having a
sex life outside the office.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: We did it in the office. She thought her
apartment was too impersonal.</p>

<p><strong>nicky</strong>: They’re always winning. Until they lose.</p>
<p><strong>toyota</strong>: Your problem is you take the easy way out.
Losing is easy.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Winning is easy. Losing is complicated. It’s
a lifetime’s work.</p>
<p><strong>toyota</strong>: It may be work but it’s not honest work.
Faith is the real work.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Clemens has a blister. Look. They’re
pinch-hitting for him.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: He’s a twenty-four-game winner. He pitches
seven solid innings. We scratch out a one-run lead. Of course he gets a
blister. Of course they put up Greenwell even though Baylor’s sitting on
the bench. Of course Greenwell strikes out.</p>

him. You want to lose. It’s too hard for you to believe in something.
It’s hard to have faith. It’s hard Nwork to trust somebody.</p>

nine that day.”</p>

them. Believe in your self. Take a risk. It will humanize you as a
person.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I want to believe.</p>
<p><strong>toyota</strong>: If you believed, you wouldn’t be walking
around with a handgun in your belt. What does that tell me? You want to
make the night come down.</p>

get for a hard day’s work. But these last weeks I lie there helpless.
Hour after hour. I’ve come close to praying for the first time since I

World Series. This is deeply, intensely personal. All the mistakes I’ve
made, all the envy, fear and violence that’s encased in this little
envelope we call a person – all washed away in the next few minutes. And
your grandmother knows why.</p>

Because a real door requires a tremendous and prolonged pounding before
it finally gives way.’ He’s a great player…how could that ball go

<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Will I believe you when you tell me

<p><strong>nicky</strong>: There’s nothing left for me to lie about.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: You’re dead. I see you on a morgue slab
drained of all fluids.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I see the outline of your body in chalk on

<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Daddy, wait.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Then they lost?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Why does it matter?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: If they lost tonight, they’ll lose tomorrow.
It’s all over.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Why do you care?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: They’re my team.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: No. They’re not your team. They’re my
team.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: They’re my team, too. I grew up on Boyleston
Street. Right by Fenway Park. I went to fifty or sixty games a year. All
by myself. I was one of those kids with scabby elbows. I called out to
the players. `Look over here. Hi, I’m Steven. My parents are
divorced.’</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I went to college in Boston so I could be
near the Red Sox. I took summer classes and the cut them to go to the
game. My wife is from Boston. Lillian Ziegler?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: The Red Sox were my world. I surrendered my
existence to a team that couldn’t win the big one.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: If you’re such a devoted fan, why were you at
the play tonight instead of the game? Answer carefully. This is
important. You could have gone to the theater last night. There was no
game last night.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Because I can’t bear to watch. When they
lose, I die inside. It’s like some little person named Steve just
crumples up and dies. I wait for the scores. I still die, hearing the
scores, but it’s over in a second. I can’t survive the game pitch by
pitch, inning by inning. I’ve done it too many times. And I can’t do it
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I was six years old the day Pesky hesitated
throwing home and Slaughter scored all the way from first. That’s when I
knew the Red Sox were my team. Pity and terror.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: When I traveled through Asia this summer, I
went to tremendous trouble and expense to rent a car with a phone so I
could call up Sports Phone in New York and get the scores. I drove
through the war in Afghanistan calling Sports Phone like every hour on
the hour, for updates.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: What about my play?</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Yes. And no more evasive tactics.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: It’s your best play, Nicky.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: See, Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I’ve seen it twice. I went back tonight to
be sure. It’s a brave and honest piece of work.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: What else?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: An artistry and sensitivity you’ve never
shown before.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: And you’re not saying that because of the gun
in my hand?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: You’re out of bullets.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: See, Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: And Peter Redmond helped immensely. These
pauses were exquisitely timed. He made us wait and wait. He built a
gorgeous tension and suspense.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: We worked very hard on the pauses.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I called Sports Phone from Lhasa, Tibet.
Freezing in my little rented Fiat. Sheep on a hillside. Rocky debris
dating back millions and millions of years, from the time the Himalayas
thrust up when the plates of India and Asia collided. Red Sox 3, White
Sox 2. A moment in the history of the world.</p>
