<h1 id="napoleon">napoleon</h1>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Napoleon was born at Ajaccio in Corsica on
August 15th, 1769. He had not been a healthy baby and his mother,
Letizia, lavished him with care and devotion. In middle age, he would
write about her from St. Helena.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: My mother has always loved me. She would
do anything for me.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Who has been putting glass in my pitcher?
Look here, someone has filled my pitcher with glass!</p>
<p><strong>dufour</strong>: Oh, my goodness! Someone has filled
Bonaparte’s pitcher with glass. Now, who on earth would do a thing like
that?</p>
<p><strong>bremond</strong>: Oh, heavens, look someone has filled my
pitcher with glass too!</p>
<p><strong>monk</strong>: Silence! Silence! You should not make fun of
Monsieur Bonaparte, he comes from a country where it is never very cold.
He has probably never seen ice before.</p>
<p><strong>dufour</strong>: Never seen ice before? Oh, dear me – how
very odd.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: At the age of 9, Napoleon entered the
Royal Military College at Brienne, in France, under a royal scholarship.
For the next five and a half years, he would devote himself to
preparation for his military career. These were harsh and cheerless
years for the lonely, impoverished provincial, among affluent French
noblemen’s sons.</p>
<p><strong>bremond</strong>: Good afternoon, Bonaparte.</p>
<p><strong>bremond</strong>: What are you reading?</p>
<p><strong>bremond</strong>: Dear me, aren’t we in an unfriendly mood.
Caesar’s conquest of Gaul. Aren’t we terribly conscientious about our
studies? By the way, did the supervisor give you permission to take that
book away from the school grounds?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Fuck off, Bremond.</p>
<p><strong>bremond</strong>: Oh, my goodness. What language! Did you
learn that from your mother, Bonaparte?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Fuck off!</p>
<p><strong>dufour</strong>: Oh, goodness, my dear Bonaparte – I am
clumsy. Oh, and look at your book!</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: At the age of 16, he graduated a
sub-lieutenant from the Royal Military School in Paris, and was posted
to the crack regiment de la Fere, at Valence.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: The practical professional training that
Napoleon would receive for the next three years would give him a working
knowledge of all arms, and expose him to the advanced military ideas of
du Teil, Bourcet and Guibert.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: His moods at this time were complex and
varied.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Life is a burden for me. Nothing gives me
any pleasure; I find only sadness in everything around me. It is very
difficult because the ways of those with whom I live, and probably
always shall live, are as different from mine as moonlight is from
sunlight.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: He made friends with a family called
Columbier, and would later write of his first flirtation with their
daughter, Caroline.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: It will scarcely be considered credible,
perhaps, but our whole business consisted in eating cherries
together.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Good evening, sir.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Good evening, Mademoiselle.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: The weather is terrible, isn’t it, sir?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Yes, it is. It must be one of the worst
nights we have had this winter.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Yes, it must be.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: You must be chilled to the bone, standing
out of doors like this.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Yes, I am, sir.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Then what brings you out on such a
night?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Well, one must do something to live, you know
– and I have an elderly mother who depends on me.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Oh, I see… That must be a great
burden.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: One must take life as it comes – do you live
in Lyon, sir?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: No, I’m only here on leave. My regiment is
at Valence.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Are you staying with a friend, sir?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: No… I have a… room… at the Hotel de
Perrin.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Is it a nice warm room, sir?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Well, it must be a good deal warmer than
it is here on the street.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Would you like to take me there, so that we
can get warm, sir?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Uh-hh… yes, of course – if you would like
to go… there… but… I have very little money.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Do you have three francs, sir?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Br-rrr, these sheets are like ice.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Oh, I’m sorry about that.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Lisette.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Only Lisette?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Lisette La Croix.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: That’s a very nice name. Where are you
from?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Please, sir, come into bed or I shall die of a
chill.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Oh, yes… of course.</p>
<p><strong>varlac</strong>: Citizens, word has come from Paris that the
foul prison of the Bastille has been captured. That its Governor’s head
is up on a pike. All Paris is now in the hands of its people. Soon all
France will be in the hands of its people.</p>
<p><strong>varlac</strong>: Good day to our brothers-in-arms. Have you
come to join us?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: I am looking for Monsieur George Varlac
who resides in the Rue de Frelicot. Do you know him, monsieur?</p>
<p><strong>varlac</strong>: Very well, Citizen Lieutenant. You have come
to the right place, for I am Citizen Varlac.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Contrary to what you have been telling
these good people, Monsieur Varlac, France is still in the hands of its
proper authorities, and they have sent me here with a warrant for your
arrest. You are charged with the murder of Monseigneur de Bouchy and his
son, and the burning of his chateau.</p>
<p><strong>varlac</strong>: A revolution is not a polite discussion in a
parlor, Citizen Lieutenant. One does not call it murder to kill such
vermin.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: You may save your philosophy for the
magistrate, Monsieur Varlac. I am only a simple officer in the army, and
to me what you have done is called murder, and his always been called
murder by honest men.</p>
<p><strong>varlac</strong>: Then do you propose to arrest all of us,
Citizen Lieutenant? For I was not there alone.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: No, Monsieur Varlac, my warrant is only
for you. Now, will you please come down at once. You will be taken back
to Chalon for trial.</p>
<p><strong>varlac</strong>: Citizen Lieutenant, my advice is to leave
this town at once with your men. We do not wish to do harm to our
brothers in uniform.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Monsieur Varlac, do not pretend to speak
for these good people whom you have misled and inflamed with violent
speech. Now, I order you to come down from the cart.</p>
<p><strong>varlac</strong>: I do not recognize the authority of the King
or any of his lackeys.</p>
<p><strong>varlac</strong>: I suggest that you leave with your men while
you can.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Monsieur Varlac, I will count slowly to
five, and if you have not begun to get down from the cart by then, I
will carry out your execution, on the spot.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: One… Two… Three…</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Four… This is your last chance, Monsieur
Varlac.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Five…</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: A confessed murderer has just been shot.
Now, let all honest men return to their homes.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Incredible… Incredible… How could he let
that rabble into the Palace? If he had ridden out among them on a white
horse, they would all have gone home. If he lacked the courage to do
that, a whiff of grapeshot – and they would still be running.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: In the summer of 1793, Civil war swept
through France, and the important naval base at Toulon fell into the
hands of a Royalist insurrection, which quickly handed over the port to
a combined British and Spanish fleet.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: A French army of 10,000 was ordered to
retake the port, but its commander, General Carteaux, a well- known
Parisian painter, had little experience in war and the siege quickly
became a stalemate.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Paul Francois Nicolas Barras, former
Viscount, now Citizen Deputy from the Committee of Public Safety, had
been sent from Paris to personally report on the failure of the
Siege.</p>
<p><strong>barras</strong>: Citizen generals, I have read all your
reports and noted your signatures. In substance, your views are
unanimous. The English positions, defending Toulon, are too strong to be
taken by our present force. The two unsuccessful attacks to date would
appear to support your arguments.</p>
<p><strong>barras</strong>: Citizen generals, it is no secret with what
displeasure the Committee of Safety looks upon any lack of patriotism or
revolutionary zeal. On the other hand, it obviously does not wish to
indulge in a futile waste of life. Before I send your reports to Paris
for the Committee’s review, together with my opinion, I should like to
give you a final opportunity to present any new ideas which you may have
developed since writing these reports.</p>
<p><strong>carteaux</strong>: Citizen Barras, since there does not seem
to have been any new thoughts among us, may we know the opinion which
you, yourself, have formed?</p>
<p><strong>barras</strong>: General Carteaux, my report on the conduct
of this campaign will go in writing to the committee.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Excuse me, Citizen Barras.</p>
<p><strong>barras</strong>: Yes – who spoke up?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: I did, sir.</p>
<p><strong>barras</strong>: Yes, Captain? Have you anything you wish to
say?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Yes, with all due respect, I do Citizen
Barras.</p>
<p><strong>barras</strong>: Please…</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: May I come to the map?</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: In July of 1794, the death of Robespierre
ended the Reign of Terror and sent Paris headlong into a lavish whirl of
pleasure seeking and sensuality, as if it were necessary to shake off
the nightmare and make up for lost time.</p>
<p><strong>corsican</strong>: Yes, sir?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: A glass of champagne, please.</p>
<p><strong>corsican</strong>: Yes, sir. I hope you will excuse me for
asking, General Bonaparte, but are you Corsican?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Yes, I am.</p>
<p><strong>corsican</strong>: I thought so, I noticed your name when you
were announced. I’m Corsican too – my name is Arena.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Oh – where do you come from?</p>
<p><strong>corsican</strong>: Bastia – and you?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Ajaccio.</p>
<p><strong>corsican</strong>: Have you been back recently?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: I haven’t been there for three years.</p>
<p><strong>corsican</strong>: I haven’t been back for ten years. Is your
family still there?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: No, they’re living in Nice now.</p>
<p><strong>corsican</strong>: That’s a nice city. This is your first
time here, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.</p>
<p><strong>corsican</strong>: You don’t know many of Citizen Barras’
friends, do you?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Ah-hh, no.</p>
<p><strong>corsican</strong>: I thought not. I noticed you by yourself,
all night.</p>
<p><strong>corsican</strong>: Just a minute, General. Listen, don’t let
them fool you with all their grand la-de-da. They’ve all made their
money from the war – mostly from crooked war contracts. They say Citizen
Barras has put away millions.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: I see…</p>
<p><strong>corsican</strong>: And they say something else about him.
They say he never goes to bed with less than two at a time – two at a
time, and they say it doesn’t make a lot of difference to him which sex
they are, if you follow my meaning, sir.</p>
<p><strong>corsican</strong>: Have a nice evening, General.</p>
<p><strong>barras</strong>: My friends, dinner will be ready in half an
hour. Please make your plays accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>barras</strong>: How is your luck, darling?</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: A new political crisis was brewing in
Paris. The moderate government of the Convention, which came to power
after the fall of Robespierre, soon showed itself to be inept, corrupt
and unpopular – and it was now faced with a serious challenge from the
royalists. General Menou, sent out to deal with the mob, lost his nerve
and agreed to withdraw his troops from the Section.</p>
<p><strong>royalist speaker</strong>: Citizens of Paris, this morning,
the troops of the Convention, under orders to sweep us from the streets,
gave way before our victorious banners. Their officers knew they would
not fire upon us. Citizens of Paris, nothing can stop us now. We are
40,000 strong. Tomorrow morning, we will occupy the Convention itself,
and we will exterminate the hypocritical parasites who have bled France
without pity. Long Live the King!</p>
<p><strong>barras</strong>: Ah, my dear friend, come in, come in. Please
sit down.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: I’m sorry, I was at the theater and I
didn’t receive your note until I returned to my hotel.</p>
<p><strong>barras</strong>: Thank you for coming. Would you care for a
drink?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: No, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>barras</strong>: I don’t have to tell you of our latest
difficulties.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Things are quite serious, I should
say.</p>
<p><strong>barras</strong>: We expect an attack on the Convention
tomorrow morning, at daybreak, and I have been placed in charge of its
defense.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: What do you have in mind?</p>
<p><strong>barras</strong>: To be perfectly honest, I haven’t the
vaguest idea.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Are you serious?</p>
<p><strong>barras</strong>: I don’t even know whether a defense is
possible.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: What forces do you have at your
disposal?</p>
<p><strong>barras</strong>: About 5,000 troops.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Cavalry?</p>
<p><strong>barras</strong>: The 21st Dragoons, about two or
three-hundred troopers.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Any cannon?</p>
<p><strong>barras</strong>: There are none here.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Where are they?</p>
<p><strong>barras</strong>: Well, I believe there are at least 30 guns
at Sablons.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: You could have them here by daybreak.</p>
<p><strong>barras</strong>: Is this enough to oppose 40,000 men?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Properly arranged, yes.</p>
<p><strong>barras</strong>: These are odds of 8 to 1.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: The numbers are not particularly relevant.
You are not up against soldiers – this is a mob, and they will run as
soon as things become sufficiently unpleasant.</p>
<p><strong>barras</strong>: Would you be prepared to handle this for
me?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Are you proposing to transfer command to
me?</p>
<p><strong>barras</strong>: In every practical sense, yes, but,
officially, of course, I would have to retain command.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Fair enough.</p>
<p><strong>barras</strong>: I must be honest with you. I first
approached three generals more senior than yourself, and they all very
prudently sent excuses.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: I’m not insulted.</p>
<p><strong>barras</strong>: You realize what is at stake?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Our lives, the revolution, my career?</p>
<p><strong>barras</strong>: Look, let me be completely open with you, I
have a carriage and an escort waiting for me, and I have a great deal of
money outside of France. Unless we stand a very good chance of carrying
this off, I am prepared to call it quits right now.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Paul, everything will be all right.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: I ordered the artillery to fire ball
immediately, instead of blanks, because, to a mob, who are ignorant of
fire arms, it is the worst possible policy to start out firing blanks.
When they first hear the terrific noise of the guns, they are
frightened, but, looking around them and seeing no effect from the
cannon, they pick up their spirits, become twice as insolent and rush on
fearlessly. It becomes necessary then to kill ten times their number to
make an impression.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: The crisis was over, and the way was paved
for the formation of the new government of the Directory, with Barras at
its head. Napoleon was made Commander of the Army of Italy.</p>
<p><strong>marmont</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>orderly</strong>: Excuse me, Captain, but there is a young
man outside who wishes to see General Bonaparte – his name is Eugene de
Beauharnais.</p>
<p><strong>marmont</strong>: General Bonaparte is seeing no one this
morning.</p>
<p><strong>orderly</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: What did you say his name was?</p>
<p><strong>orderly</strong>: Eugene de Beauharnais.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Is he alone?</p>
<p><strong>orderly</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Show him in.</p>
<p><strong>orderly</strong>: Citizen de Beauharnais.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Good morning, Citizen de Beauharnais.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: Good morning, sir. Are you General
Bonaparte?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: I am, Citizen. Is your mother Madame
Josephine de Beauharnais?</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: Yes, sir. Are you acquainted with her?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: I have met her. What is your business with
me?</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: I believe you issued an order that all
citizens of Paris must hand over any weapons that they have in their
possession.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: That is correct.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: This morning, a Lieutenant and three
soldiers came to our house and asked if we had weapons. I explained we
had only my late father’s sword, which, in fact, was not a weapon but
only a keepsake of memory.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: A sword is a weapon whatever else you
might wish to use it for.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: I told the Lieutenant my late father was
General Alexander de Beauharnais, and asked if there was any
consideration that might be given to his memory.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: And he sent you to me?</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: He said no one had the authority to rescind
the order except you.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Does your mother know you have come?</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Well, then, you have a lot of initiative,
my young friend.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: My father’s sword means more to me than any
other possession I have.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: You realize, of course, that thousands of
swords have been collected. How do you expect me to find yours?</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: The Lieutenant gave me a receipt for it and
said it would be kept at the Section Le Pelletier Police Barracks.</p>
<p><strong>hortense</strong>: Mama, this is General Bonaparte.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Madame de Beauharnais.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: Ah, how nice to meet you, General
Bonaparte. One has read so much about you lately. Please sit down.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Thank you, Madame de Beauharnais. You
probably don’t recall but we met briefly a few months ago, at a party at
Paul’s house.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: Oh… yes, of course! Have you met my
daughter, Hortense?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Yes, we introduced ourselves at the
door.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: May I offer you a drink?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Oh, I don’t want to put you to any
inconvenience.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: Oh, it’s not the slightest inconvenience,
General Bonaparte. It is an honor to have you here.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: You are very kind, Madame de Beauharnais.
Do you have some sherry, perhaps?</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: Yes, of course. Hortense, darling, will
you tell Louise to bring some sherry?</p>
<p><strong>hortense</strong>: Yes, mama. Will you excuse me, General
Bonaparte?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Yes, of course.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: I hope you will forgive me for barging in
on you like this, Madame de Beauharnais. I called to bring this to your
son, but I understand from your charming daughter that he is out for the
afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: Yes, I’m afraid he is. I believe he is
riding. I know he’ll be heartbroken to have missed you.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Well, I’m sure that you will be just as
pleased to have this as he will be.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: General Bonaparte, my curiosity is
unbearable. May I ask what you have in that mysterious package?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Your late husband’s sword, Madame,
returned with my compliments.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: Oh… how very nice of you to bring that
for Eugene… Did General de Beauharnais give it to you?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: No, I’m afraid I never had the pleasure of
meeting the General. This sword was taken several days ago from your son
by some of my soldiers.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: Oh, you must forgive me, General
Bonaparte, I’m afraid you will think me incredibly stupid but I know
absolutely nothing about this. Eugene is so independent – he hardly
tells me anything any more, and he has so many things in his room, I
must confess I wasn’t even aware that he had this sword – you know how
boys can be!</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: My dearest Josephine – I awaken full of
you. Between your portrait and the memory of our intoxicating night, my
senses have had no respite. Sweet and incomparable Josephine, what is
this bizarre effect you have upon my heart? What if you were to by
angry? What if I were to see you sad or troubled? Then my soul would be
shattered by distress. Then your lover could find no peace, no rest. But
I find none, either, when I succumb to the profound emotion that
overwhelms me, when I draw up from your lips, from your heart, a flame
that consumes me. You will be leaving the city at noon. But I shall see
you in three hours. Until then, mio dolce amor, I send you a thousand
kisses – but send me none in return, for they set my blood on fire.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: My dear Theresa – I am being urged to
remarry. You have met General Bonaparte at my house. Well, then, it is
he who wishes to serve as father to my children. Do I love him? You are
going to ask me. Well, no. Do I, then, find him unattractive? Again, no
– but worse still, I find myself in a state of indifference, of
lukewarmness.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Mama, I’m sorry that I didn’t write to you
about this, but I thought that it would be much better to tell you
myself.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Mama, I know that when you meet her, you
will love her as much as I do.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: My dearest Josephine, every moment
increases the distance between us, and with every moment that passes I
feel myself less able to endure the separation. You are the eternal
object of my thoughts, and my imagination exhausts itself wondering what
you are doing.</p>
<p><strong>general le clerc</strong>: I should like you to meet my aide-
de-camp, Captain Hippolyte Charles – Madame Bonaparte.</p>
<p><strong>captain charles</strong>: I am delighted to meet you, Madame
Bonaparte.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: Thank you, Captain. Won’t you both please
sit down?</p>
<p><strong>general le clerc</strong>: Thank you very much, Madame
Bonaparte. I have come at the instruction of General Bonaparte to bring
this letter from his mother in Nice.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Soldiers, you are half-naked and badly
clothed. The authorities find much fault with you and yet can give
nothing. Your patience, your courage are admirable but you are not
getting any fame. I will lead you into the must fruitful plains in the
world – rich provinces and great cities shall be your possessions, and
then you will have wealth, honor and fame in full measure.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: With the Italian campaign, Napoleon steps
onto the stage as a figure of European importance. A dozen victories in
as many months would be announced in dramatic and highly colored
bulletins. The battles of the revolution had been so far mainly
defensive. Now, there was revealed a new kind of offensive warfare such
as had not been seen in Europe for centuries.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Napoleon now introduced a new era of wars
of maneuver. Everything would be sacrificed to mobility. The complicated
battle formations of the 18th century would be abandoned, and the army
freed from clumsy baggage trains. War would be made to feed on war. The
armies opposing him were still committed to the rigid ideas of the
previous era, and their soldiers were treated as automatons. As they
could not be trusted to forage for themselves without deserting, such
armies were slowed down by their supply trains. The revolution, on the
other hand, had produced an army of intelligent citizens, which could
move fast by living off the country, and in which courage and initiative
were rewarded by promotion.</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: Captain, take 20 men. Assemble all the
inhabitants on the main street, and collect all mail and newspapers.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: There is no man more cautious than I am
when planning a campaign. I exaggerate all the dangers, and all the
disasters that might occur. I look quite serene to my staff, but I am
like a woman in labor. Once I have made up my mind, everything is
forgotten, except what leads to success.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: The art of war is a simple art. Everything
is in the execution. There is nothing vague in it. It is all common
sense. Theory does not enter into it. The simplest moves are always the
best.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Napoleon would soon arouse the resentment
of the Directory in Paris, exceeding his authority, making political
decisions and treaties like a Roman Conqueror, enlarging his role to
ruler of Italy. Only his tremendous success and ever increasing
popularity prevented the Directory from replacing him.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: From that moment on, I foresaw what I
might be. Already I felt the earth flee beneath me, as if I were being
carried away up to the sky.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: My dear Therese, the journey here to
Milan was the most difficult and uncomfortable imaginable – I am bored
to death. My husband doesn’t love me, he worships me. I fear he will go
mad with love. Worse than that, I fear for my poor Hippolyte. We may
have been indiscreet on the journey, and I think Joseph and Junot
suspect something.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Come in, Captain Charles.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: I believe you are acquainted with my
brother, Joseph Bonaparte, and my aide, Major Junot.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Yes, sir, I had the honor of meeting them
on the trip from Paris.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Captain Charles, I believe you are one of
General Le Clerc’s aides-de- camp.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Yes, sir, I am.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Was it he who assigned you to command the
escort which accompanied Madame Bonaparte’s coach?</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Was the trip normal in every respect?</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Did any difficulties of any kind arise
during the trip?</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: No, sir, none at all.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Then, you have my thanks, Captain Charles,
for safely escorting Madame Bonaparte to Milan, and you may consider
your assignment completed.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Thank you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: You will return to Paris tomorrow and you
will carry my compliments and thanks to General Le Clerc for assigning
such an excellent officer to carry out a responsibility which has meant
so much to myself and to Madame Bonaparte.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Thank you, sir. I will do that.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: You may go, Captain Charles.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: I would like both of you to read this.
Please read it aloud.</p>
<p><strong>joseph</strong>: To Citizen General Bonaparte from one who
does not wish to see him dishonored by his wife. You should know,
Citizen General, that your wife has taken a lover, one Captain Hippolyte
Charles… undated and unsigned.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Naturally, one does not take much stock in
such a piece of filth but, on the other hand, it is not the sort of
thing one can simply ignore. What do you think, Joseph?</p>
<p><strong>joseph</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Junot?</p>
<p><strong>junot</strong>: No, one cannot simply ignore it.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: I am afraid, then, I have to ask you both,
Joseph as my brother, and Junot as my good friend, whether or not you
know anything about this, or whether you saw anything at all during the
trip which might make you suspect some truth to it.</p>
<p><strong>joseph</strong>: No… nothing at all.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Not even the slightest hint of
something?</p>
<p><strong>joseph</strong>: No – Captain Charles commanded the cavalry
escort, and rode outside the carriage. In the evenings, he always ate at
another table. They hardly ever spoke to each other.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: You would tell me, Joseph, wouldn’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>joseph</strong>: Yes, of course, I would. You know I am not
one of your wife’s greatest admirers, but I certainly know nothing about
this.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: And you, Junot?</p>
<p><strong>junot</strong>: No… No, I don’t know anything about it
either. Not a thing.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Well, thank you both. As I said, I shall
regard this as a piece of malevolence from someone who does not wish
well to myself or Josephine. Naturally, I shall trust to your discretion
to say nothing about this.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: On July 2, 1798, Napoleon arrived in Egypt
with an army of 40,000 men, and a romantic dream of conquest, following
Alexander’s march into India. The Directory had been quick to approve
his plan for attacking England, indirectly, through their Eastern
Empire, rather than by invasion of Britain, and they breathed a sigh of
relief to have their unemployed conqueror off the doorstep.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: There was an air of grandiose fantasy
about the expedition. Napoleon took along a hundred and fifty
distinguished scientists, intellectuals and artists equipped with
libraries and scientific instruments. They would found the Institute of
Egypt, do the preliminary survey work for the Suez canal, and unlock the
key to hieroglyphic writing.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Good afternoon, gentlemen. I hope you are
enjoying this unusual spectacle. One cannot see this in Paris for any
price.</p>
<p><strong>monge</strong>: Are we doing well, General Bonaparte?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: We are doing very well, my dear Monge. The
mameluke cavalry are brave but they are selling their lives at a bad
price – at a rate, I should say, of 50-1. My only fear is that Murad Bey
has some means of communicating with his men, and that he will manage to
call them off before we can kill a great many more.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Those are excellent sketches, Denon. May I
have them when you are finished?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Must you, too, take this opportunity
during my absence to indulge the petty jealousies of the Bonaparte
family? Must you…</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Come in!</p>
<p><strong>junot</strong>: I believe you sent for me.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Yes, yes, please sit down. I will be with
you in a moment.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Read it back.</p>
<p><strong>bourrienne</strong>: To Joseph Bonaparte – Dear Joseph, I
have been informed by my wife of the cold and spiteful treatment she has
been receiving at the hands of my family, since my departure. I am also
informed that you have refused to pay over to her any of the money I
left with you expressly for this purpose. Must you, too, take this
opportunity during my absence to indulge the petty jealousies of the
Bonaparte family?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Oh, shit, that’s not right.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Leave us alone, Bourrienne, and come back
in half an hour.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: God damn it, Junot, wouldn’t you think I
have enough things on my mind not to waste time on a letter like this to
Joseph?</p>
<p><strong>junot</strong>: There’s probably some explanation.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Yes, I’m sure he’s been too busy chasing
his whores to be bothered about my wife.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Well, anyway, sorry to call you away from
the festivities, but where is the breakdown on serviceable vehicles? I
asked for it yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>junot</strong>: I gave it to Berthier… this afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Why did you give it to him?</p>
<p><strong>junot</strong>: I thought he would be seeing you before I
would, and would give it to you.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Well, he didn’t give it to me, and when I
ask you to do something for me, return the work to me, not to
Berthier.</p>
<p><strong>junot</strong>: I’m sorry, I thought he would give it to
you.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: I must have the breakdown now. Where is
Berthier?</p>
<p><strong>junot</strong>: He’s downstairs – somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: All right, thank you. Please ask him to
come here.</p>
<p><strong>junot</strong>: Yes… but, first, can I say something to you,
as a friend?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Certainly.</p>
<p><strong>junot</strong>: I know that I shouldn’t butt into things…
that are really no concern of mine… but you shouldn’t write a letter
like that to Joseph.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>junot</strong>: Well, maybe he’s only looking out for your
best interests.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>junot</strong>: Nothing. That’s all I can say.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: That’s all you can say? What are you
talking about?</p>
<p><strong>junot</strong>: That’s all I can say.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Now, just a minute. You have just very
clearly implied that there is a reason why Joseph should not give my
wife the money which I left for her. I can’t possibly allow a remark
like that to go without explanation.</p>
<p><strong>junot</strong>: Let’s just say, he looks after your
interests.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Look, Junot, you aren’t going to leave
this room until you explain yourself.</p>
<p><strong>junot</strong>: There are some things… better left
unsaid.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: You mean about my wife?! You mean there
are some things better left unsaid about Josephine?!</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: What the hell is the matter with you?</p>
<p><strong>junot</strong>: I didn’t want to hurt you… All I wanted to do
was to keep from hurting you. I swear I didn’t want to hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Well, whatever the hell you wanted to do,
you are going to tell me everything right now. Do you understand?!</p>
<p><strong>junot</strong>: You know that… letter you showed me in Milan
– the one about Hippolyte Charles?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>junot</strong>: I wrote it.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>junot</strong>: Yes, I wrote it.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: You wrote it.</p>
<p><strong>junot</strong>: I couldn’t face telling you.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: You couldn’t face telling me what?</p>
<p><strong>junot</strong>: About Hippolyte Charles.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: What was there to tell?</p>
<p><strong>junot</strong>: My God, what do you think?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Do you know what you’re saying?</p>
<p><strong>junot</strong>: God help me – yes.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>junot</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>junot</strong>: I was in her maid’s room at an inn we stopped
at for the night, outside of Dijon. It was an adjoining room to Madame
Bonaparte’s.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>junot</strong>: I could hear them, in the next room.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: You could hear them?</p>
<p><strong>junot</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: You mean you heard them making love?</p>
<p><strong>junot</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: How did you know it was Captain
Charles?</p>
<p><strong>junot</strong>: I questioned the maid, and she admitted
Charles had been Madame Bonaparte’s lover for several months.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Can you give me a drink, please?</p>
<p><strong>junot</strong>: Yes, of course. What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>junot</strong>: I wanted to kill him but Joseph convinced me
it would be a mistake. He said people would say you hadn’t the courage
to deal with it yourself.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: And was it so widely known that Joseph had
reason for such concern?</p>
<p><strong>junot</strong>: I believe so. I believe Madame Bonaparte was
not discreet, in Paris.</p>
<p><strong>bourrienne</strong>: General Bonaparte?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Come back in an hour.</p>
<p><strong>bourrienne</strong>: Excuse me, General Bonaparte, but I
believe this is an extremely urgent matter, requiring your immediate
attention.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>bourrienne</strong>: This dispatch has just arrived from
Aboukir, marked highest priority, for General Bonaparte’s eyes only.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Let me see it.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Nelson has engaged Brueys off Aboukir.
Brueys is dead and we have lost eleven ships.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: On October 9th, 1799, Napoleon, with only
a small entourage, arrived at the port of Frejus, in France, after a
journey of six weeks, in which he evaded a large British fleet. The news
of his arrival threw France into a delirium of joy. His return was seen
as a kind of deliverance, by a nation in the grip of economic chaos,
near anarchy and the threat of invasion.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Nelson’s victory at Aboukir quite
effectively finished the strategic purpose of the campaign, and with the
loss of all our principal fighting ships, the army was marooned in
Egypt, and our communications with the continent were severed. The only
options remaining to me were to develop the occupation of Egypt, to
maintain the morale of my army, and to respond to the threats being
created by the English and, very soon, the Turks. This was accomplished,
culminating in my final victory against the Turks, when they attempted a
landing at Aboukir.</p>
<p><strong>gohier</strong>: I wonder if you would care to tell us,
General Bonaparte, why, so soon after this admirable victory, you
decided to… abandon your army and return to France?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Citizen Gohier, my army was not abandoned
– it was left in a very strong position, and in the capable hands of
General Kleber.</p>
<p><strong>gohier</strong>: Of course, General Bonaparte. An unfortunate
choice of words. Only the enemies of your glory, whom we shall regard as
our own, would wish to give adverse interpretation to the honorable
motives of patriotism, which I am sure, induced you to… leave… your
colors. Please continue.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: After the defeat of the Turks, a
negotiation to arrange the exchange of prisoners took place aboard Sir
Sidney Smith’s flagship. At the end of the first meeting, Sir Sidney
gave my chief negotiator, General Marmont, several German newspapers, of
a fairly recent date.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Now, you must bear in mind that for more
than a year I had received no news at all from Europe, not a newspaper
or a single mail packet. Perhaps you can imagine my state of mind when I
read of the serious defeats that had been inflicted upon France during
my absence: the loss of Italy, the Anglo-Russian army’s occupation of
Holland, the imminent invasion of France herself. After several days of
deliberation, it seemed clear to me that it was my duty to risk the
English blockade and, with a few small ships, attempt to return, to
serve my country in any way that might be possible.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: The government of the Directory was
bankrupt, and its presses ran all night printing the money it would
spend the next day. Two of its five members, Sieyes and Roger-Ducos, who
had the support of the moderate political factions, were preparing to
seize power. They would welcome the inclusion of Napoleon who would
secure the support of the army, and who was now the most popular figure
in France.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: The important thing is to find the right
lawyer. One who will not protract the thing indefinitely, in the
courts.</p>
<p><strong>joseph</strong>: You know I am only too happy to be of help
to you, but surely this isn’t the ideal moment to involve yourself in
such matters.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: I know of no better time.</p>
<p><strong>joseph</strong>: You can’t be serious. It would not be good
to become another husband out of a Moliere farce.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: The comedy of my marriage is sufficiently
well known already.</p>
<p><strong>joseph</strong>: You must not act impetuously.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: It is time to clarify the situation.
Everything is over between us.</p>
<p><strong>joseph</strong>: But you can do the same thing in six months.
The next few weeks may be the most important ones in your life.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: My mind is made up. She will not set foot
in my house again. I think if I saw her again, I might be tempted to
strangle her.</p>
<p><strong>joseph</strong>: Are you sure that you are not still in love
with her?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Are you trying to insult me?</p>
<p><strong>joseph</strong>: Of course not, but such violence of feeling
makes me wonder.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Well, you shall see.</p>
<p><strong>joseph</strong>: When is she supposed to return?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: I have no idea. Her maid said she left two
days ago, to meet me – I can imagine where she is. But when she finally
does come home, she will find her things in the street and my door
locked.</p>
<p><strong>joseph</strong>: She will probably appear with a dozen
excuses and you will forgive her anyway.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: My dear Joseph, the only thing that is
clear is that my wife is a slut – and while a man may want a slut for
his mistress, he does not want her for his wife.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Were you in love with him?</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: I thought I was. I was confused.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: And now?</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: Now, I know that I shall die if you leave
me.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Do you expect me to believe that?</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: And you, are you in love with any one
else?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: But you have had mistresses while you
were away.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: Were you in love with any of them?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: Were they pretty?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: Were any of them prettier than I am?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: One had better legs.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: Were any of them married?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Yes. They were the easiest. I made love to
one of them within ten minutes of our first meeting.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: She must have been in love with you.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Not in the least. After all, what is
adultery – only a brief transaction on a couch, requiring a few minutes
of privacy.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: Promise me you will never leave me.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: I cannot promise you that.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: Promise me.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: I will never forgive you.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: I don’t care, but promise you will never
leave me.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: I don’t understand you.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: Promise.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Promises mean nothing.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: Perhaps – but tell me you promise,
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: All right – I promise.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: You are my old friend.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: For the next three weeks, conspiracy was
openly carried on in Paris – in the salons of bankers, generals,
politicians and government officials.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: The man responsible for protecting the
government, the Minister of Police, Joseph Fouche, was part of the
plot.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: In the early morning hours on November
9th, notifications of an emergency meeting of the councils, to be held
that morning at 7 o’clock, were delivered to those deputies who
supported the conspiracy.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Sieyes warned the sympathetic deputies of
an imminent plot to seize the government by the radical Jacobin party,
none of whose members had been summoned to the assembly. He then
proposed two resolutions which were quickly passed.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: The first called for the appointment of
Napoleon to command the troops assigned to protect the councils. The
second called for the councils to be moved, on the following day, to
St. Cloud, ten miles from Paris, where they would be safe, and out of
reach of the Paris mob.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Later, the same day, the three members of
the Directory who were not part of the plot were effectively taken out
of the picture. Barras was forced to resign under threat of death and an
offer of gilded exile.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Gohier and Moulins, who would not be
intimidated, were locked up under guard at the Luxembourg.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: The next morning, on November 10th, at the
Palace of St. Cloud, the final moves were to be made which would bring
Napoleon to supreme power.</p>
<p><strong>delbrel</strong>: Citizen Deputies, we have been isolated
here at St. Cloud and surrounded by troops. Yesterday, we were told this
was to protect us against a plot to seize the government. Today we are
told that all five members of the Directory have suddenly, and without
any warning, resigned. Now we have been asked to pass a resolution
forming a provisional government, of three consuls to replace the five
directors – these three consuls being General Bonaparte and two of the
newly-resigned members of the Directory, Sieyes and Roger-Ducos. We have
further been asked to adjourn this assembly for a period of three
months, leaving all executive and administrative power in the hands of
the three newly- appointed consuls, who will then draw up a new
Constitution.</p>
<p><strong>delbrel</strong>: Citizen Deputies, does any one in this room
have the slightest doubts as to what is being attempted, or to the
identity of those who are involved?</p>
<p><strong>delbrel</strong>: Especially so, since I have it on excellent
authority that the three members of the Directory who are not present
here today have, indeed, not resigned willingly, but in the case of
Gohier and Moulins, they are under arrest in the Luxembourg – and, in
the case of Barras, a resignation was forced from him under threat of
death.</p>
<p><strong>lucien bonaparte</strong>: Order, order, order. Citizen
Delbrel, you are out of order. You are out of order.</p>
<p><strong>delbrel</strong>: And you, Citizen Bonaparte – your role as
President of this assembly is an honorary one, given only for the period
on one month, on the occasion of your brother’s return from Egypt. And
since your nomination was originally put forward by the two
conspirators, Sieyes and Roger-Ducos, I demand that you immediately
disqualify yourself from these proceedings and leave this chamber!!</p>
<p><strong>lucien bonaparte</strong>: You are out of order, Citizen
Delbrel! You are out of order!</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>orderly</strong>: Major Lavallette to see you, General.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Send him in.</p>
<p><strong>lavallette</strong>: General Bonaparte, I have a message from
Lucien. He says there is not chance at all now to bring the proposals to
a vote. Delbrel has given the alarm to the other parties. He says you
must either use the troops immediately, or think of saving
yourselves.</p>
<p><strong>sieyes</strong>: Oh, my God. I told you he should have been
arrested yesterday. Why did I listen to you?</p>
<p><strong>joseph</strong>: Will you use the troops?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Only as a last resort. What are the
Councils doing now?</p>
<p><strong>lavallette</strong>: Both chambers are swearing an oath to
the Constitution.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>orderly</strong>: A message from Citizen Fouche.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Let me have it.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: My dear Bonaparte, if you have not already
done so, I urge you to press things to a conclusion. I cannot guarantee
the situation for very much longer in Paris.</p>
<p><strong>sieyes</strong>: Go and make sure the carriage and driver are
ready to leave at a moment’s notice.</p>
<p><strong>sieyes</strong>: Well – what are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Have patience – all will be well.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>orderly</strong>: Citizen Bourrienne to see you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Send him in.</p>
<p><strong>bourrienne</strong>: A message from Lucien – he says that you
had better act now. Delbrel is going to introduce a motion to halt the
oaths and take a vote to outlaw the three of you.</p>
<p><strong>sieyes</strong>: Oh, my God! Oh, my God! We will all be on
the guillotine in 24 hours.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Please stop chattering – and let me
think.</p>
<p><strong>sieyes</strong>: There is nothing left to think about. We
will be outlawed! You’ve waited too long! I’m leaving, and any one who
wishes to save his neck will follow suit.</p>
<p><strong>deputy #1</strong>: What – bayonets in here?</p>
<p><strong>deputy #2</strong>: Soldiers! You are violating the sanctuary
of the laws. Withdraw immediately!</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Please stand out of the way. Four
grenadiers are no threat to you.</p>
<p><strong>deputy #3</strong>: Withdraw! Withdraw!</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Citizen Deputies, please stand out of the
way – I wish to approach the speaker’s rostrum!</p>
<p><strong>deputy #1</strong>: Is it for this, then, that you became a
conqueror?</p>
<p><strong>deputy #4</strong>: Withdraw, withdraw immediately, I
say!</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Citizens, please stand aside. I wish to
approach the speaker’s rostrum.</p>
<p><strong>deputy #2</strong>: Down with the Dictator! Down with the
Tyrant!</p>
<p><strong>deputy #4</strong>: Outlaw him! Outlaw him!</p>
<p><strong>murat</strong>: Citizens, you are dissolved.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: At the age of 30, Napoleon would now
become 1st Consul and head of the Executive, for a period of ten years.
The other two Consuls would become merely figure-heads.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: In the five years that followed, Napoleon
gave proof of his brilliant legislative, administrative and
organizational powers. He created effective and enduring institutions of
government; revitalized the economy; negotiated a concordat with the
Pope, thus ending the religious rebellion in the Vendee; reconciled the
bitterness between right and left by opening all careers to talent, and
bringing into his government the best minds of the aristocracy and the
ablest survivors of the revolution. Napoleon had secured the main social
and material gains of the revolution, destroying privileged orders and
modernizing the state. In exchange for this, he would now be given power
far more absolute than any Bourbon monarch.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: On December 2, 1804, Napoleon was made
Emperor of France. He would later say: “I found the crown lying in the
gutter and I picked it up.”</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Duroc, I have a bill here for 600,000
francs from Tirot, for building the Imperial throne and six decorated
arm-chairs. The amount is absurd – and, at least twice too much.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: The revolution failed because the
foundation of its political philosophy was in error. Its central dogma
was the transference of original sin from man to society. It had the
rosy vision that by nature man is good, and that he is only corrupted by
an incorrectly organized society. Destroy the offending social
institutions, tinker with the machine a bit, and you have Utopia –
presto! – natural man back in all his goodness.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: It’s a very attractive idea but it simply
isn’t true. They had the whole thing backwards. Society is corrupt
because man is corrupt – because he is weak, selfish, hypocritical and
greedy. And he is not made this way by society, he is born this way –
you can see it even in the youngest children. It’s no good trying to
build a better society on false assumptions – authority’s main job is to
keep man from being at his worst and, thus, make life tolerable, for the
greater number of people.</p>
<p><strong>monsieur trillaud</strong>: Your Majesty, you certainly have
a very pessimistic view of human nature.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: My dear Monsieur Trillaud, I am not paid
for finding it better.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: You clumsy fool. Quick, we need some
water.</p>
<p><strong>major-domo</strong>: This way, if you please, Madame.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: No, no, I’ll take care of it myself. We
don’t want to have any more accidents.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Quick, where is the water?</p>
<p><strong>major-domo</strong>: Here it is, Your Majesty.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Ah, good, here – allow me, Madame
Trillaud.</p>
<p><strong>madame trillaud</strong>: Oh! Your Majesty!</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Don’t be afraid.</p>
<p><strong>madame trillaud</strong>: But the guests… my husband… the
Empress…</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Don’t be afraid, my dear. We shall be back
before dessert is finished.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Don’t worry. It’s only the night maid.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Yes – what is it?</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: Open the door. It’s me.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Go away – I’m busy.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: I know what you’re doing in there.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Don’t be ridiculous and go away – I’m busy
working.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: Where is Madame Trillaud?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: How should I know. Ask Roquier – he’s
cleaning her dress.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: What are you doing in there?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Oh – now, this is absolutely ridiculous!
If you don’t want to be humiliated in front of your guests, you will
return to the table at once.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: Will you be joining us, soon?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: I will be there in five minutes. Go back
to your guests.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: Five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Yes!!</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: Five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Darling – don’t be ridiculous. We have
five minutes. Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>madame trillaud</strong>: But, Your Majesty, we will be
missed now.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Of course we won’t – five minutes will
never be noticed.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: How dare you do that to me tonight? How
dare you? Do you realize who Madame Trillaud’s husband is? Suppose he
found out?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Oh, shut up, will you?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Your tears have absolutely no effect on
me… What a fool I have been! I am not a man like any other man. I must
be free – I must be free to do what I please. I must be free of this
sordid jealousy!</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Very well, then, I will not put a specific
time limit on this, but you must accept the idea that we will have to be
divorced, and soon… And, from now on, we will sleep in separate
bedrooms.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: Separate bedrooms?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: But you will not… be safe…</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Not be safe? What on earth are you talking
about?</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: In case of a… surprise attack… at night…
I am such a… light sleeper… I could wake you… I could scream.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: It’s me.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Sit down.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: I didn’t mean the things that I said… I
was angry and I said more than I meant to.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: Oh, my darling. I’m sorry, too. I won’t
do that again – whatever you do. I won’t cause you any more
embarrassment, I promise.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: Oh – I didn’t tell you… I’ve seen
Dr. Corvisart, and he was very reassuring and encouraging. He has had
excellent results with the waters of Plombiers, and he thinks it would
be a good idea for me to spend a few weeks there. Apparently, he sent
Madame Le Floch there last year, and she gave birth to twins.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Indeed – well, you may tell Dr. Corvisart,
I should be entirely satisfied with half her success.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Since the year 1069, France and England
had been at war for a total of 152 years. And, from 1338, the Kings of
England also called themselves the Kings of France, until Napoleon
obliged them to drop this title at the time of the short- lived Peace
Treaty of Amiens, in 1802. In the following year, England again declared
war on France, and the conflict between British and French imperialism
for maritime supremacy and world power would now be fought to a
finish.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: The struggle was resumed on familiar and
inconclusive lines, as neither side could really get to grips, while
England was supreme on the sea and Napoleon on land.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Napoleon devised a plan to lure the
British fleet into a wild goose chase, to the West Indies, leaving the
Channel unprotected long enough for the French to ferry their army
safely across. But the scheme was poorly executed, and eventually led to
the disastrous French naval defeat at Trafalgar.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Napoleon’s invasion plans were foiled by
England’s correct naval strategy, and by their alliances with Austria
and Russia. Subsidized by England, Francis II was goaded into war by
Napoleon’s assumption of the crown of Italy.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: He was joined by the young, melancholy
Tsar Alexander I, who had ascended the throne at the age of 24, after
the Palace Guard murder of his father, Tsar Paul, and now had rival
pretensions to Napoleon as the arbiter of Europe.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: But four months later, on the anniversary
of Napoleon’s coronation, Alexander would weep over the shattered wreck
of his army, on the battlefield of Austerlitz.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Ah, my dear Francis, what a genuine
pleasure it is to meet you at last.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: I fear our meeting is long overdue…
Napoleon.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: I’m sorry that I am unable to offer you
better hospitality, but this is the only place I have inhabited for the
past month.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: You have made such excellent use of it; I
should think you will hate to leave it.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Shall we move closer to the fire?</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Yes – an excellent idea.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Will Alexander be joining us soon?</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: I very much doubt that he will.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Oh…?</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: I’m afraid he has been rather upset by the
outcome of the battle.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: But he asked me to say… on his behalf… that
your achievements have increased his… admiration for you, and that he
believes… your success is predestined by heaven… and that his army…</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: My dear Francis, you do seem extremely
uncomfortable.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: I’m afraid I am, just a bit.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Would you like some brandy?</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: I’ll have the fire built up.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Berthier, we need some more wood for the
fire – and some brandy.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Thank you, Napoleon.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Francis, may I ask whether you wear warm
winter underwear?</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: No – not as a rule.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Ah, well, that is the first rule of
warfare. You must wear long-sleeved and long-legged underwear. You can
never conjure up brilliancies with a cold bottom.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Having ruined the Austro-Russian alliance
by her neutrality, Prussia proceeded, in the following year, to commit
suicide by taking on Napoleon single-handed.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Led by the warlike Queen Louisa, and her
fashion-minded husband, King Frederich Wilhelm, the Prussians still
believed themselves cast in the mold of Frederick the Great, and more
than a match for Napoleon. The King had a special collection of 60
splendid uniforms, and was personally involved in the design of all the
Prussian army uniforms.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: If the French army had been commanded at
Jena and Auerstadt by a tailor, the King of Prussia would certainly have
gained the day.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Prussia would make the same strategic
error that Austria made in the previous year, and she would
over-confidently rush forward to meet the French alone, without waiting
for their Russian allies. In seven days of fighting, the Prussian army
would be virtually destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Unconvinced by his defeat at Austerlitz,
committed by alliance to Prussia and concerned about his interest in
Poland, Alexander would once again take the field against Napoleon.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: But in June of the following year, after
the crushing defeat at Friedland, Alexander would be forced to sue for
peace again – this time in person, and with some surprising results.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Ah, my dear, Napoleon, how good it is to
meet you at last.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: And, what a great pleasure it is, indeed,
to meet you, Alexander.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: And, what a delightful idea!</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Ah – you approve?</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: I think it’s absolutely charming.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: I’m glad you like it.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Whatever suggested the idea to you?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: I shall tell you in the strictest
confidence – when I was a boy, I had a passion for rafts, and never had
the opportunity to build one.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Alexander had come to treat as a fallen
enemy, but would find that to be defeated by Napoleon seemed equivalent
to winning a great victory. There would be not territorial demands, no
reparations – only an intoxicating proposal to divide the world between
them.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: We have no rivalry, we have no vital
issues at stake. We are only at war because you are the ally of England,
and, in this, it seems to me, you are serving only the interests of
England.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: If your fight is against England, and
against her alone, then we shall easily come to terms – for I have as
much reason to complain as you have. England has brought me into
conflict with false promises, and has left me to face defeat single-
handed.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Napoleon and Alexander would spend two
weeks together, seeing each other every day and sharing the
entertainments of the evening. Each had set out to charm and flatter the
other, and each would succeed. They would talk of everything together,
as two brothers – philosophy, women, politics, war, science.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: My dear sister, God has saved us. Instead
of having sacrifices to make, we are coming out of this struggle with a
kind of glory. But what do you think about this? I spend whole days with
Bonaparte, and hours and hours in private conversation with him. I as
you – isn’t this like something from a dream?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: If Alexander were a woman, I think I
should fall passionately in love with him. But, at the same time, there
is something very peculiar about him – something lacking, but it is
impossible to foresee precisely what will be lacking in any given
instance, for the defect seems infinitely variable.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: You can always tell at a glance whether
retreating infantry are being pursed by cavalry, because they hurry
along and keep turning around and looking back. When they are retreating
before infantry, they merely trudge along, head down.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Fascinating! Tell me, leaving aside the
question of grand strategy, for the moment, what would you say is the
single most difficult tactical skill to master?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Without a doubt, to estimate the enemy’s
strength on the battlefield. This is something that is only acquired by
experience and instinct. At Jena, there were as many opinions about
strength of the enemy as there were generals present. Murat said there
were 50,000, preparing to attack. Berthier said there were no more than
25,000, about to withdraw. “Berthier sees only what is in the open,”
Murat said. “But don’t forget there is a second force hidden in the
forest.” And so it would always go, each of them would judge things
according to his own ability, character and state of mind, at the
moment.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Ah, my dear Napoleon, sometimes I feel
that I am not really an Emperor as you are.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: I know absolutely nothing of war – and I
am still totally dependent upon my generals.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: That is a problem, and I can appreciate
your feelings. But I’m sure you have great talent for war, and I could
teach you a lot. If we are ever at war again together, you should lead,
say, 30,000 men, under my orders – you would soon get the feel of
it.</p>
<p><strong>talleyrand</strong>: Article 46, calls for the virtual
dismemberment of Prussia, reducing her population by half and her army
to a token force.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Does she deserve anything better?</p>
<p><strong>talleyrand</strong>: Those are extremely harsh terms.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: I did not ask her to go to war against
me.</p>
<p><strong>talleyrand</strong>: Has Alexander agreed to this?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Yes, he has.</p>
<p><strong>talleyrand</strong>: Now, the section headed “Secret Clauses
of the Treaty” – Article 14b, provides for Alexander to serve as
mediator between France and England and, if he fails to achieve a
preliminary agreement within four months, it further provides that
Russia is to go to war against England, and close her ports to English
trade.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: That is correct.</p>
<p><strong>talleyrand</strong>: Do you think Alexander has any chance to
succeed as a mediator?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: I very seriously doubt it. I don’t think
there is any possibility of making peace with England so long as she
sees herself safe from invasion. That is why we must increase the
pressure on her economy. With Russia in the Continental Blockade,
England must collapse. More than 40% of her trade is with the Continent
and Russia.</p>
<p><strong>talleyrand</strong>: England can make no move against you on
the Continent without Austria. A reliable treaty with Austria would end
her hopes in that regard.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: We have a treaty with Austria.</p>
<p><strong>talleyrand</strong>: Not one I should like to rely on.
Francis is still smarting under the terms he had to accept after
Austerlitz, and he is under great pressure to recover his losses.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: My dear Talleyrand, none of the Kings of
Europe bear any friendship for France. It is easy for you to talk of
reliable treaties. The only treaties you have been able to negotiate are
the ones I have won on the battlefield.</p>
<p><strong>talleyrand</strong>: What I am talking about is
moderation.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: What you are talking about is a gamble on
moderation – when I gamble, I prefer to gamble on force.</p>
<p><strong>talleyrand</strong>: And where do you place Alexander?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Alexander and I are friends. We have
reached an understanding.</p>
<p><strong>talleyrand</strong>: I hope that understanding is worth as
much as you think it is, sire. My impression of Alexander is that he is
moody and impressionable, capable of acting on sudden impulses which
then lead to sudden embarrassments. He is an unpredictable mixture of
idealism and vanity. You have dazzled him, and you have performed a
diplomatic miracle, but Alexander is weak and he is easily influenced by
the last one who has his ear.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: That is a matter of opinion.</p>
<p><strong>talleyrand</strong>: Sire, you have only enemies in the court
of St. Petersburg, and I fear outside your influence, Alexander will
have another look at what he has agreed to.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: He will stand by his agreement – I know
him better than you do.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: My dear Alexander, between us there must
never be any third parties. We must always deal directly with each other
and never allow Ministers or advisors to muddy the waters.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: The political interests of my monarchy,
and the wishes of my people, require that I should transmit to an heir,
the throne, on which providence has placed me. For many years, I have
lost all hopes of having children by my beloved wife, the Empress
Josephine. It is this consideration which induces me to sacrifice the
dearest affections of my heart, to consult only the good of my subjects,
and to desire the dissolution of our marriage.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: With the permission of my august and dear
husband, I must declare that, retaining no hope of having children, who
may satisfy the requirements of his policy in the interests of France, I
have the pleasure of giving him the greatest proof of attachment and
devotedness that was ever given on earth…</p>
<p><strong>d’angely</strong>: I respond to all the sentiments of the
Emperor in consenting to the dissolution of a marriage which is now an
obstacle to the happiness of France, be depriving it of the blessing of
being, one day, governed by the descendants of that great man, who was
evidently raised up by providence to efface the evils of a terrible
revolution, and to restore the altar, the throne and social order.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: On the day after the divorce, Napoleon
drove to Malmaison to visit with Josephine, and this visit was to set a
pattern for all those to come. They were always announced in advance,
there was something ceremonious and constrained about them, and they
always left Josephine in a state of deep depression.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: My dearest Josephine – I was heartsick at
the sight of you yesterday. I, too, am sad today and need to know that
you are more composed. This great palace echoes with emptiness and I
feel terribly isolated. I am dinning all alone tonight. The page I sent
to Malmaison this morning tells me he saw you weeping. You promised me
you would stop. I want very much to come to see you but you will have to
show more self-control.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: Sometimes I have the feeling that I am
dead, and that the only sign of life remaining to me is the vague
sensation that I no longer exist.</p>
<p><strong>duroc</strong>: Good heavens, Ambassador – what has
happened?</p>
<p><strong>schwarzenburg</strong>: Ah, good evening, my dear Duroc. I’m
afraid I’ve been out hunting and I have had a rather bad fall.</p>
<p><strong>duroc</strong>: Indeed you have, Ambassador. Have you sent
for a doctor?</p>
<p><strong>schwarzenburg</strong>: Yes, I have, and I hope you will
forgive me, Duroc, but unless your visit is extremely urgent, I shall
have to ask you to excuse me until tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>duroc</strong>: I beg your indulgence, Ambassador, but it
is.</p>
<p><strong>schwarzenburg</strong>: Oh?</p>
<p><strong>duroc</strong>: The Emperor has decided to marry your
Archduchess, Marie-Louise.</p>
<p><strong>schwarzenburg</strong>: What is that?</p>
<p><strong>duroc</strong>: Earlier this afternoon, the Emperor refused
the hand of the Grand Duchess Anna, of Russia, and, as I’m sure you can
appreciate, he is quite able to change his mind again. For the Emperor,
to choose a wife, is only a matter of minutes.</p>
<p><strong>schwarzenburg</strong>: But this is not a matter which can be
settled tonight, surely?</p>
<p><strong>duroc</strong>: No one can say how the Emperor’s thoughts
work, Ambassador, and unless we move quickly, he might change his mind
again.</p>
<p><strong>schwarzenburg</strong>: But, my dear Duroc, how can I act
without guidance from Vienna? I haven’t the slightest idea of how the
Emperor Francis might feel about this.</p>
<p><strong>duroc</strong>: May I suggest that we can prepare and sign
the agreement, between ourselves, subject to the approval of the two
Emperors. Believe me, my dear friend, your Archduchess, Marie-Louis, may
very well hold, in her hands, the future of our two countries.</p>
<p><strong>francis ii</strong>: I grant my daughter’s hand to the
Emperor of the French.</p>
<p><strong>marie-louise</strong>: I, with my father’s permission, give
my consent to my union with the Emperor Napoleon.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: On arriving, the Empress Marie- Louise
will ascend the steps on the north side, and the Emperor Napoleon will
use those on the south side. The monarchs will arrive at the middle
simultaneously. Upon perceiving the Emperor, the Empress will kneel and
bow her head, and the Emperor will raise and embrace her.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Good evening, ladies. You must forgive me,
my dearest wife, but I simply could not wait to see you.</p>
<p><strong>marie-louise</strong>: Oh, then you are…</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Yes, my dearest Marie-Louise, I am your
husband.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: My dear, sweet Marie-Louis, you are even
more beautiful than your portrait.</p>
<p><strong>marie-louise</strong>: And, where did you see my
portrait?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Ah, you must forgive me, my dearest
Marie-Louise, I saw it during one of my stays at your palace – at
Schonbrunn.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: I hope you will forgive me for any
inconveniences I may have caused you, and your family, in the past.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: And, you, my dear wife, do you find that I
resemble my portraits?</p>
<p><strong>marie-louise</strong>: You are much younger, and much more
handsome, than your pictures.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Good! Good! Then we are both pleased with
each other. How fortunate we are – eh? How fortunate we are!</p>
<p><strong>marie-louise</strong>: Do you like music?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Yes, I do – very much.</p>
<p><strong>marie-louise</strong>: Will I be able to play the harp? It is
an instrument of which I am very fond.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Of course, my dear.</p>
<p><strong>marie-louise</strong>: You are so good to me. Will you also
allow me to have a botanical garden?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: You may have anything you wish, my sweet
and lovely Marie-Louise.</p>
<p><strong>marie-louise</strong>: I am told that Fontainebleau has many
lovely views. I know nothing more interesting than a lovely
countryside.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: I am sure you will enjoy the French
countryside.</p>
<p><strong>marie-louise</strong>: I hope you have patience with me. I do
not know how to dance the quadrille but, if you desire it, I will
learn.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: I only desire what gives you pleasure, my
dearest.</p>
<p><strong>marie-louise</strong>: Will it be possible to have my dog,
Bijou, sent here? I was not allowed to bring her and I love her so
much.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Of course, my dear – how cruel to have
been separated from her. And how strange it must be for you to be here,
away from your family and everything you know.</p>
<p><strong>marie-louise</strong>: Oh, no, I am very happy. But you must
have patience with me… I know nothing at all of what a wife must know.
And I know nothing about men. My papa has never allowed me even to have
a pet of the male gender.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Did the Emperor or Empress give you any…
instructions of any kind… before you left?</p>
<p><strong>marie-louise</strong>: Papa said only to comply with any
request you might make of me.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Oh, my dearest child – you must not worry
about anything. I will teach you everything that you must know.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Do you know the joke about the two Swiss
boys who go to a bordello for the first time?</p>
<p><strong>marie-louise</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Well, two nice little Swiss boys, who are
virgins, decide they will save up their money and go to a bordello.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: At the door, one of them loses his nerve
and decides to wait in the street while his more adventuresome friend
goes inside. Fifteen minutes later his friend comes out.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: “Well, what was it like?” the timid one
asks. “Oh,” his friend nonchalantly replied, “The movements are
ridiculously simple, but the feeling is wonderful!”</p>
<p><strong>marie-louise</strong>: Blow out the candle, please.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: Ah, my dear Madame de Montesquiou, you
have no idea what happiness it brings me to see this child, at last. I
was told the very idea of such a visit would too much distress the
Empress.</p>
<p><strong>montesquiou</strong>: I am delighted to be of service to you
again, Your Highness. And I can tell you, my instructions came directly
from the Emperor, with a caution to be discreet.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: Oh… I see. I understand. How is… the
Emperor?</p>
<p><strong>montesquiou</strong>: I rarely see him, Your Highness, but I
believe he is in excellent health, and he is very happy with the
child.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: Ah, that is good.</p>
<p><strong>montesquiou</strong>: And, you seem in excellent health, Your
Highness.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: Ah, well, my dear Madame de Montesquiou,
peace of mind can eventually be a substitute for happiness.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: My dear sweet child, one day, perhaps you
will know the sacrifice I have made for you, and I leave it to your
governess to make you aware of it.</p>
<p><strong>marie-louise</strong>: My adorable papa, I can announce to
you that your prophesy has been realized. I am as happy as possible. My
husband loves me profoundly and I return his affection. I feel sure that
I shall live happily with him. I assure you, my dear papa, that the
Emperor is as careful of my health as you would be.</p>
<p><strong>major fidon</strong>: Stop the carriage!</p>
<p><strong>major fidon</strong>: Good day, monsieur. Do you think it is
possible for you to tell your driver to stop ringing that bell?</p>
<p><strong>russian gentleman</strong>: My regrets, my dear Major, but I
believe you have been blocking the road.</p>
<p><strong>major fidon</strong>: Are you trying to provoke me,
monsieur?</p>
<p><strong>russian gentleman</strong>: No, Major, I merely wish to state
that your vehicle appears to be somewhat slower and heavier than mine,
and point out that, if you would be kind enough to pull over to one side
of the road, I could pass you and be on my way.</p>
<p><strong>major fidon</strong>: May I inform you, monsieur, that I am
Major Fidon, official courier to the court of the Emperor Napoleon, on
my way to our Embassy at St. Petersburg and, in accordance with the
rules of the road, no one may overtake or pass me.</p>
<p><strong>russian gentleman</strong>: Before you quote the rules of the
road to me, Major, may I point out to you that you are not in France
now, but that you are a guest in Russia.</p>
<p><strong>major fidon</strong>: If I have given you any cause to be
insulted, monsieur, may I offer you immediate satisfaction?</p>
<p><strong>russian gentleman</strong>: If you wish to put things on that
basis, then I will say good day to you, monsieur.</p>
<p><strong>major fidon</strong>: Insolent bastard! Insolent bastard!</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: By 1810, relations between France and
Russia were wearing thin. The terms Russia had agreed to at Tilsit,
three years earlier, were proving to be unrealistic and ruinous to
her.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: It is a thing entirely unknown in
diplomacy, that one government should assume a right to dictate to
another, who is upon terms of equality, the conditions on which she
should conduct her commerce; and, assuming such a right, second it by
threatening language, in case of non-compliance.</p>
<p><strong>caulaincourt</strong>: But, Your Majesty, the very substance
of the Tilsit treaty was that you should join the Continental Blockade,
boycott English goods, suspend all commercial dealings with her, and be
France’s ally. Nothing more is being asked than to comply with the
treaty.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: My dear Caulaincourt, agreements can
endure only when they allow both sides to live. Napoleon may believe it
is necessary to injure England but, before that, he must realize it is
necessary for him to allow his friends to live. He cannot expect me to
tell my nobles they must ruin themselves so that he can bring England to
her knees – and I’m afraid that is what it has come to.</p>
<p><strong>caulaincourt</strong>: I can appreciate what Your Majesty is
saying but the Emperor has staked everything on this policy. He has no
other way to attack England, and no one knows more than Your Majesty how
his overtures for peace have been rejected.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: It’s a fine thing to establish policies
but, when they don’t work, they must be reconsidered. Granted that you
have hurt England, but she is still on her feet. And to seal off her
trade with Europe, what has it cost you? You have had to rule with an
iron hand. You have turned friends into enemies. And even at that, the
result has only been partly effective. You have never been able to stop
the extensive cheating, smuggling and corruption – even of your own
officials. But I should think the situation in Spain, alone, would give
your policy a minus balance. You have had to commit a quarter of a
million of your best troops against the guerrillas, with no victory in
sight. And you have given England a dangerous foothold on the Continent,
for her armies.</p>
<p><strong>caulaincourt</strong>: I am in no position to debate this
with you, Your Majesty, but can you imagine what a blow it will be to
the Emperor if you should now desert his cause? It would mean nothing
less than victory for England.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: My dear Caulaincourt, you have no idea of
how compromised my own position has become since Tilsit. I am blamed by
the army for the military disaster at Austerlitz and Friedland, by the
nobility for ruining their trade with England, by the merchants who must
accept French foods at unprofitable prices, and by the nation for
allowing Napoleon to dictate Russian policy.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Caulaincourt, my father was strangled in
his bed by his own Palace Guard. Can you blame me for not wishing to
meet the same end?</p>
<p><strong>caulaincourt</strong>: Your Majesty knows my affection for
him is deep and genuine, and goes far beyond my official role as
Ambassador. But I would be remiss in my feelings for you, and in my
responsibility to the Emperor, if I did not say that it is entirely
possible that the Emperor will view your refutation of the terms of the
Treaty of Tilsit, as the first step in the exchange of a French alliance
for an English one – with all the dangers that might entail.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: I have given a great deal of thought to
that possibility, and I am prepared to face it. If it should come to
war, and I presume that is what you are alluding to, I would rather have
war with the Emperor than my own people.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Monsieur Barbier, I would like to have all
the books, that are best worth consulting, on the topography of Russia,
and especially of Lithuania, with special attention to the rivers,
forests, roads, marshes and so forth. I would also like to have the most
detailed account there is of Charles XII’s campaigns in Poland and
Russia.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: The seeds of the Russian campaign of 1812
were planted at Tilsit, in 1807, and began to bear fruit in 1810, when
Alexander reopened his ports to British goods and imposed high tariffs
on French imports. From then on, the situation between France and Russia
steadily began to deteriorate – friction grew, accusations were
exchanged, spasmodic negotiations were attempted, tension increased and
extensive military preparations were carried out by both sides.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Napoleon had made up his mind that a
showdown with Russia was inevitable. Dresden was appointed as a mutual
rendezvous for all the Kings, Princes, Dukes and dependent royalties of
every description, who were subordinates to Napoleon, or who hoped for
good or evil at his hands. And it was here, on May 16, 1812, where for
the last time he would appear as King of Kings.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Since my marriage, some people have said
the lion has been sleeping – they will now see whether he has been
sleeping.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: The Emperor of Austria, with his Empress,
had come to honor his mighty son-in-law. But he had already written to
Alexander that the Treaty just signed with France should not, he hoped,
prevent Russia and Austria from continuing their secret understanding,
relative to their common political views.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: The King of Prussia also came to pay his
respects. He had already written to Alexander, excusing himself for
having yielded to irresistible force and fatality. “If war breaks out,
we shall harm each other only as much as is strictly necessary,
remembering constantly that we are one, that we must one day be allies
again.”</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Never was the success of an expedition
more certain. I see on all sides nothing but probabilities in my favor.
For the first time, I advance at the head of the combined forces of
France, Austria, Italy, Germany, the Confederation of the Rhine, and
Poland.</p>
<p><strong>emperor francis</strong>: Let us hope that just the sight of
our preparations will cause Alexander to yield.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: That is my fervent hope. I love Alexander,
as a brother, and wish him no harm.</p>
<p><strong>frederich wilhelm</strong>: If war should come, Alexander has
sworn he will not make peace under any conditions, however many battles
he may lose, using the size of his country, the poverty of the soil and
the rigors of the climate, to wear you down.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: I know he has said that, and I am sure
that he would like to believe it’s true. But Russia is a semi- Asiatic
nation which cannot field an army as large as your own, and has no
literature or music to speak of. It is a barbarian nation, and
barbarians are superstitious and have simple ideas. A single blow
delivered at the heart of the Russian Empire, at Moscow the Great,
Moscow the Holy, will, in a single instant, put this whole blind
apathetic mass into despair.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: I know Alexander. His imagination must be
struck by some great, bold, powerful stroke, and he will come back to
me, just as he did at Friedland.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: With his army of 400,000 men in concealed
bivouacs, on a ten mile front, in the forests, bordering the banks of
the Vistula river, Napoleon conducted a last minute personal
reconnaissance, disguised in the uniform of a Polish lancer.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Well, this is an ill-omen, indeed. Caesar
would probably turn back.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: The campaign of 1812 was the first time in
which Napoleon had a marked superiority of numbers, but in accumulating
such a mass of uneven quality, he would defeat his object, which was to
bring about another Austerlitz or Friedland.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: The disparity of numbers left the Russians
no option but to avoid battle and repeatedly disengage, however much
political pressure developed for them to stand and fight.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Alexander gave orders that his retiring
army should blow up bridges behind them, destroy the cities and
villages, remove all the necessities of life, and leave behind them,
nothing but a desert waste.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Although the Russians refused any major
encounters, there was fierce fighting between the French advance guard
and the Russian rear guard.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: The Tsar’s scorched earth strategy was in
line with the views of some of the more enlightened Russian strategists,
but the army and the people were full of reckless confidence and
impatience for battle, and the long retreat to Moscow filled them with
bitterness and a sense of feebleness and incompetence at the top.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: As Napoleon approached Moscow, the court
of St. Petersburg was in despair, and the Tsar, his resolve shaken, was
ready to sue for peace. Now, the intervention of one man, Count Feodor
Vasilievitch Rostopchin, the Governor of Moscow, would have a decisive
effect on the course of history.</p>
<p><strong>rostopchin</strong>: My friends, I have it now on excellent
authority that the French will enter Moscow within a few days. Kutusov
still swears he will fight to the death, but I have learned, on
excellent authority, he has plans to surrender the city without a
struggle. Our empire is almost overthrown. The court of St. Petersburg
trembles, and will begin peace negotiations as soon as Napoleon enters
the Kremlin. One can only imagine what will be lost. My friends, we are
living in a time when men of conviction must be prepared to influence
the nation even without the approval of their sovereign. They must dare
to evaluate the public and private interests which they may be called
upon a sacrifice.</p>
<p><strong>rostopchin</strong>: The flames of our beloved Moscow will
erect a barrier of fire between the Tsar and all weakness, and they will
rob from Napoleon the end and the aim of his campaign.</p>
<p><strong>rostopchin</strong>: Is there anyone who wishes to
withdraw?</p>
<p><strong>rostopchin</strong>: Very well – there is a great deal to be
organized.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: It was all very well for Alexander to do
more damage to his country than I could possibly do, but he could not
destroy Moscow. This is the prize that will end the war. You will see,
we will have peace offerings from him within a few days.</p>
<p><strong>drum-major</strong>: Hello, grandfather. Are you the only
welcome we shall have today?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: My God…! What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>duroc</strong>: Four o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: My God, what a fire!</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: When did it start?</p>
<p><strong>duroc</strong>: The first reports came in at about ten.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Why didn’t you wake me then?</p>
<p><strong>duroc</strong>: At first, it hardly seemed more than a
routine fire.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: How did it spread so quickly?</p>
<p><strong>duroc</strong>: It is the work of incendiaries.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: I told Mortier that he would answer with
his life for any looting.</p>
<p><strong>duroc</strong>: Our troops have no part in this. It has been
started by the Russians!</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Impossible, I don’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>duroc</strong>: We have already captured a dozen
incendiaries, convicts, released just two days ago. They said they were
acting under orders of the secret police.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: But to start a fire like this in five
hours – how is it possible? It would take a carefully organized plan,
tons of combustibles and hundreds of people.</p>
<p><strong>duroc</strong>: From what we can tell, there are hundreds of
agents, all over the city. The combustibles seem to have been carefully
placed beforehand, and all the fire-engines have been removed from the
city.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: My God – this could be very bad for us…
very bad, indeed.</p>
<p><strong>general kutusov</strong>: I hope you will forgive me, Your
Majesty, for requesting an audience at such a late hour, but I have
traveled all the way from Moscow to see you, on a matter which cannot
wait.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Very well, General, what is it you wish
to say?</p>
<p><strong>general kutusov</strong>: Your Majesty, I have been advised
that you have received a letter from Napoleon, offering a peace treaty,
and that you have decided to accept it.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: I have decided to accept the principle of
a negotiation; the terms are not established.</p>
<p><strong>general kutusov</strong>: If I may, Your Majesty, I would
like to offer a dissenting opinion.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: General Kutusov, feel free to say
whatever you like.</p>
<p><strong>general kutusov</strong>: I believe I am right in saying
that, before the fire, the country had grown weary of the war, and there
were few who were interested in continuing the battle.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Proceed.</p>
<p><strong>general kutusov</strong>: But, since the fire, a completely
new spirit has been aroused in the nation. The French have become an
army of criminals, against whom Russia must be avenged, against whom she
is now prepared to fight to the death.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: You know, General Kutusov, there is a
very strong possibility that the fire was not started by Napoleon’s
troops but was organized under the orders of Rostopchin’s secret
police.</p>
<p><strong>general kutusov</strong>: I have heard that story but I do
not believe it.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Rostopchin is a fanatic and he is capable
of anything – however, it doesn’t affect what we are talking about.
Please go on.</p>
<p><strong>general kutusov</strong>: The point I was trying to make is
that I think it is reasonable to say that Your Majesty would not find
himself under unbearable pressure, if he decided to make peace with the
Emperor, at least at this time.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: For the sake of your argument, let us say
that is correct.</p>
<p><strong>general kutusov</strong>: Well, has Your Majesty considered
what Napoleon’s alternatives might be, if you simply chose to ignore his
note?</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Yes, General Kutusov, I daresay that this
has been considered and discussed at great length. Napoleon would simply
spend the winter in Moscow and continue the campaign in the spring.
Another lesser possibility might be to march on St. Petersburg now,
although there is some doubt that he has the strength to do this, until
he refits his army.</p>
<p><strong>general kutusov</strong>: You have my absolute assurance,
Your Majesty, that Napoleon does not have the strength to attack
St. Petersburg now – his army is exhausted and ill-supplied, and he
would be defeated if he attempted that.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: I will accept your assurance, but I’m
afraid I don’t see your point.</p>
<p><strong>general kutusov</strong>: Forgive me, Your Majesty, I am
about to make it.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Ah, yes – proceed.</p>
<p><strong>general kutusov</strong>: The point is that I don’t think
Napoleon will sit in Moscow until the spring! I don’t think he can
afford to.</p>
<p><strong>general kutusov</strong>: It would be a sensible decision if
he were merely commander of the army, but he is also the Emperor of
France. Can he afford to stay away from Paris for what will amount to a
year by the time he commences his campaign again in the spring? And,
even if he might consider this, his lines of communication are over-
stretched and vulnerable – they can be easily cut by our cossacks. Will
he then be willing to remain, completely out of touch with Paris – for a
year? The French are like women. You cannot stay away from them for too
long.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Well, that is a very interesting idea,
General Kutusov, but I can assure you that Napoleon is no beginner at
this. Whatever analysis you have done on this situation, I am sure that
he has gone over the same ground.</p>
<p><strong>general kutusov</strong>: I have no doubt that he has, Your
Majesty, but does he have any strong moves from which to choose?</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Well, one thing immediately comes to
mind, if what you are saying is true – he would merely withdraw his army
from Moscow and return to Poland for the winter.</p>
<p><strong>general kutusov</strong>: Your Majesty has grasped the
outlines of his problem in much less time than it took me. This is a
crucial point – and it is a political one, which Your Majesty will be in
a far better position to answer than I. Can Napoleon afford to abandon
Moscow without signing even the preliminaries of a peace treaty with
you?</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: I must confess he would look a bit silly,
fighting his way to Moscow and turning right around again.</p>
<p><strong>general kutusov</strong>: Perhaps it would be even more
serious than that, Your Majesty. His European confederation is held
together by some very slender threads. Your Majesty knows even better
than I that Austria and Prussia are very doubtful allies, and the
Emperor has reason enough to fear that they will turn on him, at the
first sign of weakness.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Proceed.</p>
<p><strong>general kutusov</strong>: If I can presume to go into the
Emperor’s mind, I believe that he has based his entire campaign strategy
on obtaining a peace treaty after the fall of Moscow. When Vienna fell,
there was a peace treaty. When Berlin fell, another treaty. That has
always been the rules of the game. But what is he to do now if no treaty
is forth- coming? He knows that beyond Moscow, there is nothing, and
that, if he withdraws, there remains only a fall into emptiness.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: What do you think Napoleon will do?</p>
<p><strong>general kutusov</strong>: I, personally, am convinced that he
will withdraw his army from Moscow, and attempt to establish himself in
Poland for the winter. In the end, he will not allow himself to be cut
off from Paris. But I believe that if he is offered any encouragement,
by Your Majesty, he will postpone this decision as long as possible. He
is a gambler and he will trust to his luck.</p>
<p><strong>general kutusov</strong>: If he withdraws his army in good
order, it will be a serious political defeat. But, if he should be
caught on the move, with his army, in the full grip of winter, then it
will be a catastrophe. If Your Majesty can prolong his hopes for a
treaty by silence, be deceit, by any means, for another month, thus
postponing his departure, then the graves of his army are already dug in
the soil of Russia.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: General Kutusov, I would like to call a
meeting of my cabinet tomorrow morning and have you present this idea to
them. I think it has merit and is worthy of consideration.</p>
<p><strong>general kutusov</strong>: I am at your disposal, Your
Majesty.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Day after day of fine autumn weather was
allowed to slip away, while Napoleon waited for the word from Alexander
which would never come. The weather was so fine and the temperature so
mild that it seemed as if even the season was conspiring to deceive
Napoleon.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: His troops fraternized with the enemy and
reported them demoralized, and tired of war.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Trunks, bearing dispatches and mail,
arrived regularly every day from Paris. It seemed as easy to travel from
Paris to Moscow as from Paris to Marseilles.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Thus, lulled by events, and by realities
he could not face, Napoleon seemed to fall into a dream in Moscow, and,
amid the dreadful storm of men and element gathering around him, he
spent his time discussing the merits of some new verses which he had
received, or the regulations for the Comedie Francaise in Paris which
took him three evenings to prepare.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Napoleon was extremely superstitious and
retained a mystical belief in his partnership with fate, a sense that he
could only do so much, and that events must somehow complete the
decision. And, so it would be in Moscow, where, without confidence and
full of apprehension, he would cheerlessly pursue his destiny, unaware
that fortune, which had so often smiled upon him, had now abandoned his
cause just when he required miracles of her.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: It was not until October 20, that Napoleon
withdrew the Grand Army from Moscow, to begin their thousand mile march
into oblivion.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: He had waited too long. But the execution
of his army would not be principally caused by cold or battle, but be
starvation.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: In order to feed the army in the barren
and ravaged wasteland through which it had to march, it was necessary to
send large foraging parties deep into the surrounding countryside,
protected by strong escorts of French cavalry, against the clouds of
Cossacks which flanked and followed the march.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: But, by November 5, the temperature was
down to 30-degrees of frost, and 30,000 French horses were dead. They
were not bred to endure such cold and, not being properly shod for ice,
had no chance to survive in these conditions.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: The cavalry was now on foot and it was a
simple matter for the hordes of Cossack cavalry to confine the
retreating French to their single road, thus transforming the finest
army the world had ever seen into a starving, feverish mob, without
purpose. General Famine and General Winter, rather than Russian bullets,
would conquer the French.</p>
<p><strong>didier</strong>: Hello there, Picart.</p>
<p><strong>picart</strong>: Ah, Didier – you are alive.</p>
<p><strong>didier</strong>: Why are you carrying the dog?</p>
<p><strong>picart</strong>: His paws are frozen and he cannot walk.</p>
<p><strong>didier</strong>: When you eat him, may I have some?</p>
<p><strong>picart</strong>: My God – don’t you recognize Mouton – our
regimental dog? I would rather eat Cossack.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: On January 1st, 1814, France itself was
invaded. Now, with a small army of raw recruits, Napoleon would have to
face the powerful combination of England, Russia, Prussia and Austria,
operating against him together, for the first time. The balance of
numbers had tilted irretrievably against him.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: A year ago, the whole of Europe was
marching alongside of us. Today, the whole of Europe is marching against
us.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: All around him, the sands were giving way,
but Napoleon struck back with a brilliance which caused Wellington, much
later on, to remark: “The study of the campaign has given me a greater
idea of his genius than any other.” For two months, Napoleon’s small
army would bedevil the jittery and uncoordinated allied armies by rapid
marches and surprise attacks on their flanks and rear.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: During much of the fighting, a peace
conference took place at Chatillon, where both sides insincerely raised
and lowered their terms with the ebb and flow of the fighting.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: But despite the brilliance of his tactics,
Napoleon’s numbers dwindled and, in desperation, he made a daring and
imaginative decision to move eastward, placing himself in the rear of
the allied armies. This would cut their long lines of communication but,
at the same time, leave open the road to Paris. Napoleon counted on
Joseph fulfilling his orders for the defense of the city, so that, if
the allies took the bait and marched on Paris, it would offer Napoleon
an opportunity for a decisive victory.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: But on March 10th, the Tsar received a
note from Talleyrand, revealing the total lack of military preparations
in Paris.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: On March 23rd, allied patrols captured a
courier carrying a letter from Napoleon to Marie-Louise in which he
rashly revealed his plans.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Although Alexander realized it was
essential for Paris to surrender within 24 hours, to avoid the allies
being trapped between the walls of Paris and Napoleon’s forces which
might attack his rear, he chose to gamble, persuading his generals to
ignore Napoleon and march on Paris. This crucial decision would bring
down Napoleon’s empire.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Well, Belliard, what’s this? What are you
doing here? Where is the enemy?</p>
<p><strong>belliard</strong>: They are at the gates of Paris, sire.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: And where is the army?</p>
<p><strong>belliard</strong>: It is on this road, sire, following
me.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: And who is defending Paris?</p>
<p><strong>belliard</strong>: Paris is evacuated, sire. The enemy is to
enter at nine o’clock tomorrow morning. The National Guard is on duty at
the gates.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Paris has surrendered?! I don’t believe
it.</p>
<p><strong>belliard</strong>: Unhappily, it is true, sire.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: But where are my wife and son? What’s
become of them? Where is Marmont? Where is Mortier?</p>
<p><strong>belliard</strong>: The Empress, your son and the whole court
left two days ago for Rambouillet. Marshals Mortier and Marmont are
probably still in Paris, completing the arrangements.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Well, you’ve heard what Belliard says,
gentlemen – come, I am going to Paris. Caulaincourt, have my carriage
brought up. Come, come, Belliard, turn your men around.</p>
<p><strong>caulaincourt</strong>: But, Your Majesty, we cannot go to
Paris now. There are no troops left there.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: No troops? The National Guard is still
there – they will follow me. Things may yet be put right.</p>
<p><strong>belliard</strong>: But, sire, Your Majesty would lay Paris
open to being sacked. The enemy is outside the gates with more than
120,000 men. Besides this, I left the city under the terms of a treaty
and I am forbidden to reenter Paris.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: A treaty? Don’t be ridiculous. What treaty
is this? Who made it? Who has been giving orders?</p>
<p><strong>belliard</strong>: I don’t know the details of the treaty,
sire, Marshal Mortier sent me word of its having been agreed to, and he
said that I was to take the army and make for Fontainebleau.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: But who made this treaty?</p>
<p><strong>belliard</strong>: I believe it was arranged by Marshals
Mortier and Marmont. I must explain to you that we have had no orders
all day. Each marshal has been keeping his own position.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Who sent my wife and son out of Paris?</p>
<p><strong>belliard</strong>: I don’t know, sire.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: And where is Joseph?</p>
<p><strong>belliard</strong>: I don’t know what has happened to Prince
Joseph.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: What cowardice! What treason! Joseph has
ruined everything. How could they all lose their heads. They knew I was
coming up fast. Victory was just within grasp. Come, come, turn your
troops around, General Belliard.</p>
<p><strong>caulaincourt</strong>: But, sire, we mustn’t risk turning
Paris into another Moscow.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: There seems little enough danger of that.
Come! Come! My carriage! The troops!</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: In defeat, Napoleon would be punished by
the Kings of Europe, according to a standard which they would not have
applied to each other. He might marry the niece of Marie Antoinette, and
call himself an Emperor, but that did not make him one.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: The treaty of Fontainebleau of April 11th,
1814, signed by the allies and Napoleon, in return for his abdication
from the throne of France, gave him the token sovereignty of the tiny
island of Elba, with the title of Emperor, a yearly income of 2 million
francs, an army of 700, and a navy of 3 ships. But in ten months time,
even this tiny stake would be sufficient capital to bring this most
reckless of all gamblers back into the game for a final, breathtaking
spin of the wheel.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: After the solitude and semi- banishment of
the last four years, Josephine found herself again at the center of
Paris society. There would be a crush of crowned and coroneted heads at
Malmaison, led by Tsar Alexander. But Josephine’s final conquest would
be pathetically brief – in two weeks, she was to die of pneumonia.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: How delightful it must have been this
spot to Napoleon. Could he but pass his life here with you, Madame, he
would have nothing to complain of but the too rapid slide of time.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: He loved Malmaison. I think it was the
only place he was ever happy and carefree.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: The fall of a great man is a sad sight to
behold… He treated me badly but, even in my religion did not not forbid
me to bear malice, I would bear him none. I am a better friend of his
than he may know.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: You were the only monarch for whom he had
both affection and respect.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: It was I who secured the sovereignty of
Elba for him, at a time when treachery and desertion of his own
followers left him at the mercy of those who would have done much worse
to him.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: I am certain you still hold his affection
and gratitude. I believe he is only bitter about the desertions to his
cause of those who were closest to him – most particularly, the
Marshals. He thought that, by giving them titles and making them rich,
he would ensure their loyalty – but in the end, they thought only of
saving their titles and estates.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Madame, I hope you will allow me to
discuss a matter which I fear may be distasteful to you at the present
time, but which, in fairness to yourself and to your children, I feel I
must – and that is the subject of your own properties and pensions.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: Oh?</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Let me be as good a friend to you as
Napoleon ever was. If you will but command me, I shall secure all that
is due to you and your children – and even more, should you so
desire.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Josephine dead – how unbelievable! How
impossible it is to believe it. She was always physically so strong –
she was never ill a day in her life.</p>
<p><strong>bertrand</strong>: It is a terrible shock.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: But did she have the best doctors? Wasn’t
there any chance at all to save her?</p>
<p><strong>bertrand</strong>: I don’t know, sire – she had the Tsar’s
personal physician.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: She should have had Larrey or Corvisart.
They might have saved her… But why didn’t anyone even write to me? Can
you believe that no one even bothered to write to me? Would you have
believed that I should read such news in a newspaper? How
incredible!</p>
<p><strong>bertrand</strong>: That is incredible.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Ah, my poor Josephine. She was the most
alluring, most glamorous creature I have ever known – a woman in every
sense of the word, and she had the kindest heart in the world. She may
have been a liar and a spendthrift, but she had something that was
irresistible – she was a women to her very fingertips… How impossible it
is to believe that she is dead.</p>
<p><strong>bertrand</strong>: I have never heard an unkind word about
her spoken.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: I suppose I might blame her for opening
her house to the men most responsible to my downfall, but how can I? She
was on her own again, she had to look after her own affairs, and how can
one blame her for having her head turned by the attention of Kings?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: She made me very unhappy when we were
first married, but when we are young we become addicted to the pain of
love and, once having experienced it, never want to be cured. For
afterwards, we dread the horrible solitude of the heart, the emptiness
of feeling…</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Look at this – how incredible! My last
souvenir – a bill I received just two weeks ago from her couturier –
6,000 francs…!</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Now I have lost everything that is
precious to me. My dearest wife has been locked away by her father, and
my poor baby grows up without me.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Marie-Louise would prove to be a little
more than a dull, commonplace, sensual girl, accustomed to obey the
dictates of her father, who easily dissuaded her from joining Napoleon,
and carefully chose instead as her aide-de-camp, the gallant and dashing
General Neipperg, who soon became her lover. They would have two
children together before Napoleon’s death.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Napoleon would never see his son again,
and the child would grow up in gilded isolation, melancholy, ignored by
his mother, in chronic ill-health and haunted by the legend of this
father. He would die at the age of 22.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: When Louis XVIII returned to Paris in
1814, he was as unknown in France as an Egyptian Pharaoh. Marked by
clumsiness and disdain, he quickly proved that the Bourbon dynasty had
learned nothing and forgotten nothing. People said that he did not
return to the throne of his ancestors but simply ascended the throne of
Bonaparte. By 1815, the army and the people were ready to rise against
him and welcome the return of Napoleon.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Napoleon set sail, from Elba, on February
26th, 1815, with his small force of 700 soldiers, while the governor of
the island, Sir Neil Campbell, was away in Florence. He put his soldiers
to work writing out his proclamations in long hand.</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: General Cannet presents his compliments to the
Emperor, and requests that he lay down his arms and surrender himself
and his men.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Thank you, Colonel. Please present my
compliments to General Cannet, and tell him that I shall come presently
and bring the answer myself.</p>
<p><strong>general cannet</strong>: Bonaparte is on his way to attempt
to illegally reestablish himself over the legitimate government of our
King, Louis XVIII. It is our responsibility, as loyal soldiers of
France, to prevent him from doing this, by whatever means are necessary.
His force numbers less than 700 men.</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: What about us – don’t we count?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Hello, men of the 5th – do you recognize
your Emperor?</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: I recognize you – we are old friends. I
know you from Friedland and Borodino. And, you there, Sergeant
Monestier, how are you?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: My good friends, I am told that Marshal
Ney has promised the King to bring me back to Paris in an iron cage. I
have sent word to my old friend, Marshal Ney, that he can make that a
wooden box, if he is able to manage it, but I certainly must refuse an
iron cage – I’m not as young as I used to be, and I can’t accept such
drafty accommodations!</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Men of the 5th, your general has invited
me to surrender myself and my men, but I come to make you an offer – Men
of the 5th, will you join me?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: I shall have to send a message to Louis
VXIII, in Paris, and tell him not to send any more troops – I have
enough already.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: After the dizzying magic of the return,
came a sense of disenchantment – and some anxious second thoughts. The
allies had quickly patched up the differences that had divided them for
almost a year, at the Congress of Vienna, and on which Napoleon had
counted to give him some breathing space. To make matters worse, they
refused to have any diplomatic dealings, declaring him a criminal beyond
the protection of the law.</p>
<p><strong>valet</strong>: Excuse me, Your Majesty.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>valet</strong>: Madame Avrillon has arrived, sire.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Oh – where is she?</p>
<p><strong>valet</strong>: I have shown her to your bedroom, Your
Majesty.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Please ask her to get undressed, and tell
her I’ll be along as soon as I can.</p>
<p><strong>valet</strong>: Yes, sire.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: The allies were preparing to move on the
frontiers of France with more than a million men. Strung along the
Belgian frontier was an army of 100,000 English and German troops, under
Wellington, separated by ten miles from a force of 120,000 Prussian
troops, under Blucher. Napoleon calculated the huge Russian and Austrian
armies could not reach his Eastern frontiers before July. This gave him
the opportunity to use a favorite tactic and strike quickly against
Wellington and Blucher, hoping to defeat them separately, before they
could unite their forces. On June 16th, Blucher was defeated at Ligny,
and Wellington was forced to retreat from Quatre Bras, but neither
victory was decisive, nor were they followed up as they should have
been, due to Napoleon becoming ill, and to mistakes by his generals. But
what would prove disastrous for Napoleon, was that he believed the
Prussians to be out of the battle for good, and retreating away from
Wellington, whereas Blucher, still full of fight, was marching north to
join him.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: On the morning of June 18th, Napoleon,
with 74,000 men faced Wellington with 67,000, on a battlefield near the
village of Mount St. Jean, ten miles south of Brussels. Confident that
the Prussians were out of action, or contained by Grouchy’s pursuing
cavalry, Napoleon’s only fear was that Wellington would retreat.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: But Wellington had decided to fight it
out, on Blucher’s assurance that at least one Prussian corps would reach
him by mid-day. He had chosen his favorite defensive position, on a
rise, where the reverse slopes would shelter his infantry from plunging
artillery fire.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Napoleon was in no hurry to start the
battle and he waited until mid- day to allow the ground to dry, so that
his heavy guns could get into position. This was to prove to be a
crucial mistake. Had the battle begun at day-break, Wellington would
probably have been defeated before the Prussians intervened.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Napoleon ignored the warning of his
Peninsular war generals about the fire-power of the English infantry,
and decided on a frontal attack on the center, preceded by an attack on
the Hougoumont farmhouse, which anchored the English right flank.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: In the opening moves of the battle, the
French could not dislodge the English from the Hougoumont farm.</p>
<p><strong>general simon</strong>: I think it is only some dust
blowing.</p>
<p><strong>general marchadier</strong>: I though for a moment, then,
that I could just make out the color of French uniforms.</p>
<p><strong>general simon</strong>: Yes – a bit of blue and red. I
thought so, too.</p>
<p><strong>general labesse</strong>: Let us hope it is Marshal
Grouchy.</p>
<p><strong>general marchadier</strong>: How far away do you make it?</p>
<p><strong>general simon</strong>: I should say, five or six miles.</p>
<p><strong>general marchadier</strong>: At least that.</p>
<p><strong>general simon</strong>: I thought for a moment I could make
out the colors of Prussian uniforms. What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: At 12:30 pm, the column approaching on the
right flank was identified as Prussian. Napoleon could have called off
the battle at this point, but the campaign would have been lost, and he
preferred the chance of smashing Wellington before the Prussians could
arrive in strength.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Had Marshal Grouchy maintained aggressive
contact with the retreating Prussians, they would have been prevented
from entering the battle. Having failed to do this, had he now marched
his 34,000 men to the sound of the guns, he would have increased
Napoleon’s army by fifty percent and would most probably have ensured a
French victory. But this was not to be, and Grouchy’s inadequacies would
be the ruin of Napoleon’s last battle.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: With Grouchy’s force out of the battle,
and the Prussians moving against his flank, Napoleon was in a
strategically compromised position, but there was still time to achieve
a tactical triumph on the battlefield before the Prussians arrived.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: But Napoleon was painfully ill, and spent
most of the day three-quarters of a mile behind the battle.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: He left the tactical handling of the
battle entirely to Marshal Ney, who, having deserted Napoleon the year
before at Fontainebleau, was the only one of that group of Marshals who
had since then reconciled with him. Berthier had committed suicide when
he heard of Napoleon’s return from Elba, and Ney’s eleventh hour switch
of allegiance to Napoleon, had left his soldier’s mind in a clouded and
uneasy state. He would now make tactical blunder after blunder, while
gallantly rushing around the battlefield like a young subaltern.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: At 1:30, Ney launched the first main
attack, when four densely massed infantry columns, unsupported by
cavalry or horse artillery, were repulsed with heavy loss.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: At 3:30 pm, Ney misinterpreted movements
in the English line as signs of a general retreat and, now, blundered
again, sending in the cavalry alone, unsupported by infantry.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: After two hours of savage fighting, the
British infantry had learned that when the French cavalry were close,
the artillery stopped. And they also realized that each time they fired
a volley, the cavalry would try to break through them, before they could
reload. So they stopped firing.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: By 6 pm, Napoleon had entered into the
battle himself and was forced to commit 14,000 men of his general
reserve to hold up Bulow’s Prussians.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: At 7:30 pm, Napoleon released 5 battalions
of the guard reserve for Ney’s final assault. When this failed, the
French morale cracked.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Wellington put in his cavalry, and the
French army broke in panic and ran.</p>
<p><strong>ney</strong>: Come on – follow me and see how a Marshal of
France dies!</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: But Ney would survive the battle to be
shot for treason by the returning monarchy.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Napoleon escaped from France where he
might have met the same fate, and surrendered to the English, hoping for
a congenial exile in Britain. But he was sent as a prisoner to the tiny
island of St. Helena, in the South Atlantic, a thousand miles from the
nearest land. He would live out the last five years of his life there,
amid the petty squabbles of his own entourage, and his captors.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: His house was a hastily rebuilt collection
of buildings originally constructed as cattle-sheds.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: His four constricted rooms were infested
with rats. His food and wine, and opened mail were subjects of
continuous dispute.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: His walks were so closely guarded that he
eventually gave them up altogether.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: His gaoler, Sir Hudson Lowe, was a weak,
narrow-minded, and petty man, obsessed with the fear his prisoner would
escape, though a squadron of ten ships, and a garrison of 3,000 men
guarded the island.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: His final illness would, until the very
end, be dismissed by English doctors as a diplomatic disease.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Who is there?</p>
<p><strong>bertrand</strong>: Bertrand, sire.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: I have just had the most vivid… dream…
about Josephine.</p>
<p><strong>bertrand</strong>: Yes, sire?</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: She was sitting there… and it was as if I
had last seen her only the night before… She hadn’t changed – she was
still the same – still completely devoted to me… and she told me we were
going to see each other again and, never again, leave each other… She
has promised me. Did you see her?</p>
<p><strong>bertrand</strong>: No, sire… I was asleep.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: I wanted to kiss her, but she didn’t want
to kiss me… She slipped away, the moment I wanted to take her in my
arms.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Napoleon died on May 5, 1821. Hudson Lowe
insisted the inscription on the tomb should read “Napoleon Bonaparte.”
Montholon and Bertrand refused anything but the Imperial title –
“Napoleon.” In the end, it was left nameless.</p>
