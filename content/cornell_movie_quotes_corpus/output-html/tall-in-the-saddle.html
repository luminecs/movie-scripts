<p><strong>station agent</strong>: Expectin’ someone?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: I guess not. Where’s the stagecoach
office?</p>
<p><strong>station agent</strong>: Back of the depot.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Consarn you, Blossom – lookit that – jus’
lookit what you done – I’m tellin’ you, Blossom that – – makes you the
most aggravatin’ female as ever I had a despise fer – I’ve got a good
notion to pizen you – an’ what’s more –</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Heh-heh – fooled you, didn’t I? – Fooled
myself, too.</p>
<p><strong>stage agent</strong>: Howdy.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: That the stage for Santa Inez?</p>
<p><strong>stage agent</strong>: Leaving any minute.</p>
<p><strong>stage agent</strong>: Santa Inez – seventeen-fifty –
Name?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Rocklin.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Mind if I ride alongside the driver?</p>
<p><strong>stage agent</strong>: It’s all right with me – if it’s all
right with Dave – He’s mad – His last trip – Had a row with Harolday,
the boss – Old-timer, Dave – an’ a grumpy old cuss.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: I like grumpy old cusses – Hope to live
long enough to be one.</p>
<p><strong>stage agent</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>stage agent</strong>: Here’s your mail, Dave –</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: – and a passenger.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Mind if I ride up here?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Where’s them wimmen?</p>
<p><strong>stage agent</strong>: Up at the hotel.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Why ain’t they here? – This is the stage
depot, ain’t it – ? Ain’t it?</p>
<p><strong>stage agent</strong>: You can pick ’em up there – it’s only
up the street –</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: On’y up the street – an’ they cain’t walk it –
What’s the matter – don’t Easterners have laigs like other folks?</p>
<p><strong>stage agent</strong>: Hold tight when you git in the
mountains, mister – When he gits riled you can hear the passengers
prayin’ for miles.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Whar’s them wimmen? – They waitin’ for you to
carry ’em out?</p>
<p><strong>saddler</strong>: Dave – Dave – tell Arly Harolday her saddle
ain’t ready yet, will ya?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: I ain’t tellin’ that crazy female nothin’ –
Last time I seen her she threatened to rip the hide off’n me and bat me
dizzy with it.</p>
<p><strong>saddler</strong>: Mister – will you tell the Agent at Santa
Inez to tell Miss Harolday her saddle ain’t ready yet?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: I’ll say that.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: By next year, madam, we expect to have a
bathtub on each floor.</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: Now don’t drop it –</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: At your age you’d best not be lifting
things so heavy.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Mebbe you’re young enough to hoist her up your
own self.</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: Clara!</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: Staring as though you’d never seen a
man before.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Try to hold him down or he’ll scare the women
to death.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: I never feel sorry for anything that
happens to a woman.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Well, I hope you have a nice trip,
ladies.</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: I hope we get there – wouldn’t surprise
me if we didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Wait till I get you on the road, you old
buzzard, you’ll be surprised all right.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: I wonder why a young feller who don’t have to
wants to come into this God danged country?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Say – did you mean what you said back there
about wimmen?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Every word of it.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Then you’re smarter than most.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Maybe I seen more of ’em than most.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Shouldn’t be surprised. Shouldn’t be a leetle
bit surprised. All the same…</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: All the same – what?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Take a slug.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: and squinting through</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Take another.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Not just yet.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Well… Here’s to her.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: The next one that fools you.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Mighty rough stretch along here.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Like me to speel you a while?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Nope. I’ve had a few snorts but that don’t
make no difference. Leas’ways, never has… Don’t ever git wore out, and
useless, like me.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Who’re them as say you are?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Harolday, for one. Oh, I ain’t belly- aching.
Reckon he’s entitled to his opinion. But him and me never did see eye to
eye.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: It’s constitootional, I reckon. Like that
step-daughter of his is crazy – he’s too sane. Believes In law and
order.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: What’s wrong with law and order?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Depends on who’s a-dishin’ it out. Never was
good at takin’ orders meself. As for the law – well, you’ll soon find
out what that means ’round these parts.</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: Driver? Driver, what’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Nothin’. Restin’ hosses. Git out and stretch
yore laigs if you want.</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: Resting horses? What for? I can see
with my own eyes it’s downhill.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: You in such an all-fired hurry, lady?</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: Certainly, we are in a hurry.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Well – we’ll hurry some.</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: Now what’s the matter. Why are we
stopping again?</p>
<p><strong>pablo</strong>: Buenas noches, senor.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Buenas noches, amigo.</p>
<p><strong>pablo</strong>: Ha llegado anticipademente, senor.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Tuvimos suerte en haber llegado.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: We stop here.</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: Why do we stop here?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: If you wanta eat and stretch yore laigs.</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: Will you please stop referring to my
legs!</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: You got some, ain’t you?</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: Dave!</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Why, Zeke, you two-legged old coot!</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Whar you been all these months?</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: Up in the hills workin’ my way down the
biggest hole you ever seed.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Good – What’s at the bottom of it?</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: Nothin’!</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: What, again!!</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Good evening, ladies. How about something to
eat?</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: toward the pair at</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: This way, ladies.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Yep – this is my last trip.</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Old Harolday won’t take back what he said.</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: What’d he say?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: “You’re fired.”</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: There you are, folks. Dig in and help
y’rselves.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Supper, Dave?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: I’m drinkin’ mine. Set ’em up.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Auntie –</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: With my dyspepsia? Do you want to kill
me?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Aren’t you going to have any supper?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Reckon so.</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: Young man, that driver’s had all the
liquor he can take.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Has he?</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: You know he has. You’re not a complete
fool, are you?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Frequently.</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: The rudeness of people in these parts
is appalling!</p>
<p><strong>bob clews’ voice</strong>: Well, well – smells like a mighty
nice bit of veal.</p>
<p><strong>bob clews</strong>: Doin’ yourself well these days, Stan.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: A friend of mine was by an’ sold me a quarter
of beef.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: The same friend as sold you that hide Bob,
here, found stashed in your barn yesterday?</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Hide – What hide?</p>
<p><strong>bob clews</strong>: The one that might send you to the
penitentiary.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: What did you do with it, Stan?</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: I never had no hide stashed –</p>
<p><strong>bob clews</strong>: I saw it yesterday under the hay.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Then it must still be there.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: No it ain’t – we looked – Where is it?</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: I tell ya –</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: What is all this?</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: Afternoon ma’am. Miz Caldwell ain’t it?</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: No – Martin – Miss Martin – This is
Miss Caldwell.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: Glad to know you, miss – Been expectin’ you
at Santa Inez. I’m Sheriff Jackson. Any relation of Red Caldwell’s a
friend of mine.</p>
<p><strong>bob clews</strong>: You’re sure gonna brighten things up
considerable around the K.C. Ranch.</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: What’s going on with him?</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: Just a little matter of the law.</p>
<p><strong>bob clews</strong>: Rustlin’.</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: Wrestling?</p>
<p><strong>bob clews</strong>: Rustlin’ – cattle stealin’.</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: Oh – a thief –</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: I tell ya I never –</p>
<p><strong>bob clews</strong>: Save it –</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: Matter of fact – Bob, here, says that the
hide he saw yesterday had the K.C. brand on it.</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: Oh – hmmm – well, what do you intend
doing about it?</p>
<p><strong>bob clews</strong>: Law’s pretty harsh ’round here on cattle
thieves.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: Course, we don’t want to make a mistake
with an old-timer, but –</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: How about the owner of that beef – mightn’t
he have somethin’ to say about it?</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: Meanin’?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Red Caldwell – he’s the owner of the K.C.,
ain’t he?</p>
<p><strong>bob clews</strong>: You’re ’way behind the herd, mister – Red
Caldwell died three weeks ago.</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: Was murdered, you mean.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: That’s right – shot in the back – not far
from here.</p>
<p><strong>bob clews</strong>: Maybe he was gettin’ on to things about
the cattle that’s been missin’ from the K.C. lately.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: I tell ya I ain’t never had any hide –</p>
<p><strong>bob clews</strong>: Well, you got beef –</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Yes – an’ I got a bill of sale fer it,
too.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: S’pose you let me see that bill of
sale.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: It’s right out here.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: Like I said – I wouldn’t want to make a
mistake with an ole-timer.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: See that one? She ain’t got no laigs.</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: Hold your tongue. And you – stop
staring as if we were monsters.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Where’s Stan? We got to have another
drink.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: He’s outside tryin’ to explain away a
hide.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Eh?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Seems we’re eatin’ stolen beef.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Somebody’s loco. Stan might have given
house-room to bit o’ dead beef, but he’d never be fool enough to leave
the hide lyin’ around. How ’bout it, Zeke?</p>
<p><strong>bob clews</strong>: That’s the way it is, Dave.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Oh – it’s you.</p>
<p><strong>bob clews</strong>: That’s right – your old pal Bob
Clews.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Git away from me – you two-timin’ horse
thief.</p>
<p><strong>bob clews</strong>: Them’s fightin’ words, pardner.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Hey, Stan – don’t let ‘em hang nothin’ on you,
you ain’t done. They’re just a couple of fourflushers – the pair of ’em,
everybody knows that.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: Crazy drunk.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Mebbe I am drunk – mebbe that’s why I’m
tellin’ the truth – I’m drunk an’ I’ll say what I think – I’ll say what
I know.</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: So will – I –</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: Don’t act up this ways, Dave – They’s women
watchin’.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Git your hands off me –</p>
<p><strong>bob clews</strong>: What he needs is a short lay-down.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: I’ll lend a hand.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: Me an’ Bob’ll look after him. We’re his
friends – come on, Bob. Careful now – don’t hurt him.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: How are things standin’ now between you an’
the law?</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: All right, I reckon – I guess this bill of
sale – – kinda winded him.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Good thing you saved it.</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: Musta been dreamin’ – Thought I was sittin’ on
a pot of gold.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: There ain’t no gold here.</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: There ain’t even a pot.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: How is he?</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: Went to sleep soon’s we laid him down.
Sorry to have a ruckus in front of you ladies. Dave’s an ornery old cuss
when he gets goin’ – No shape to drive on, I’m afraid.</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: Hmmm –</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: Don’t worry, ma’am. Bob, here, ’ll take you
on in – knows every inch of the road – Don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>bob clews</strong>: You bet.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: I’m drivin’.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: But if anything was to happen to the
ladies, I’d feel – to blame.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Don’t.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: You ladies want he should drive?</p>
<p><strong>bob clews</strong>: I’ll be more’n glad to accommodate you
–</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: He’s going with us anyway – he may as
well drive.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: Anything you say, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>mexican</strong>: Venga con migo, senor.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Did they do it?</p>
<p><strong>mexican</strong>: Si, senor. They hit him with a pistola.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: His friends, eh?</p>
<p><strong>stableman</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Bumped his head.</p>
<p><strong>stableman</strong>: Where – on Iron Mountain?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Where’s the best chance of a cheap
room?</p>
<p><strong>stableman</strong>: There’s Cap’s place across the Street –
the Sun-Up Saloon.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: I’ll pick that up later.</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: This isn’t the hotel.</p>
<p><strong>stableman</strong>: No’m, lady. Hotel’s up the street a
piece.</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: Are we expected to carry our bags at
this time of night?</p>
<p><strong>stableman</strong>: Want to drive ’em on up?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Nope. Here – catch aholt.</p>
<p><strong>cap</strong>: Hey Doc!</p>
<p><strong>cap’s voice</strong>: Customer –</p>
<p><strong>doc riding</strong>: Take my hand, Sammy.</p>
<p><strong>doc riding</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Bumped his head.</p>
<p><strong>doc riding</strong>: I see. Looks like he’s going to need a
couple or so stitches. Better get him upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Okay. You can book me a room, too.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: No laigs.</p>
<p><strong>doc riding</strong>: He’ll be all right in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>doc riding</strong>: How about a snort?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Don’t mind if I do.</p>
<p><strong>cap</strong>: Will he make it?</p>
<p><strong>doc riding</strong>: Sure he’ll make it. Can’t kill off a
salty old hairpin like Dave that easy.</p>
<p><strong>cap</strong>: You’re right. Reckon Saint Peter must be
gitten’ mighty tired of dustin’ off that doormat for him. By the way,
how did you say it happened?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>cap</strong>: That’s right; you didn’t. Reason I ask is, a
couple fellers was in saying how Dave was kickin’ up a ruckus up at
Stan’s place. Sheriff Jackson it was and one of the Clewses.</p>
<p><strong>doc riding</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>cap</strong>: Tough customers, the Clewses.</p>
<p><strong>doc riding</strong>: Yeah – don’t pay to start something with
’em you don’t intend to finish.</p>
<p><strong>cap</strong>: By the way, Doc, they tell me George’ll be out
again. That’s Bob Clews’ brother. Jest done a stretch in pen ‘tentiary
for horse stealin’.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: They string ’em up for that where I come
from.</p>
<p><strong>doc riding</strong>: Pity they didn’t string him up while
they wore about it.</p>
<p><strong>cap</strong>: That’s what Arly Harolday was sayin’ only this
mornin’. You ain’t met our Arly yet, I reckon?</p>
<p><strong>doc riding</strong>: He will, if he stays here long
enough.</p>
<p><strong>cap</strong>: Hell-fire in skirts.</p>
<p><strong>doc riding</strong>: Well, here’s now.</p>
<p><strong>clint</strong>: What did I tell you? They gotta be big to
beat me!</p>
<p><strong>cap</strong>: Clint Harolday’s in luck tonight.</p>
<p><strong>doc riding</strong>: They’re certainly running for him. About
time, too. He’s taken a beating this last week would shake a better
man.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Include me out.</p>
<p><strong>clint</strong>: Aw – come on. Can’t you take it?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Not that sort o’ luck, I can’t. Besides, I
on’y came in to oblige.</p>
<p><strong>clint</strong>: Come on, Doc. I still got to take something
from you.</p>
<p><strong>doc riding</strong>: No more tonight, son. I’ve a full day
ahead.</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: How about you, sir? Care to sit In? I’m
warnin’ you, though – our young friend here has been holding phenomenal
cards.</p>
<p><strong>clint</strong>: Have a heart, Judge. This ain’t no two-bit
saddle-tramp’s game. This is for real money.</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: Fine! Oh – this is Pap Fossler; Shorty
Davis; Ab Jenkins; Mr. Harolday, and my name’s Garvey – Judge Garvey. I
didn’t get your name.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: I didn’t give it. Deal.</p>
<p><strong>clint</strong>: Raise you twenty.</p>
<p><strong>pap</strong>: Table stakes, Clint.</p>
<p><strong>clint</strong>: Not if he wants to dig.</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: No place for me.</p>
<p><strong>pap</strong>: Cards?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: One.</p>
<p><strong>clint</strong>: One for me.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Don’t you know that Queen is dead?</p>
<p><strong>clint</strong>: I can take it if I want it.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Sure – if you want – but you’ll have to
beat my hand with four cards.</p>
<p><strong>clint</strong>: I’m playing these, mister!</p>
<p><strong>cap</strong>: I’m not settin’ in.</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: Why don’t you split the pot?</p>
<p><strong>clint</strong>: I’m not splitting – I’m betting!</p>
<p><strong>clint</strong>: Are you calling?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: I’m raising.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Dig.</p>
<p><strong>clint</strong>: Let me have some money</p>
<p><strong>pap</strong>: You’re in deep enough, Clint.</p>
<p><strong>clint</strong>: I’ve called for all I’ve got. Full house.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: No good. Kings up. Your third queen is
dead.</p>
<p><strong>clint</strong>: You – mister – get away from that table. And
get out of here. Maybe from now on you’ll know a full house beats two
pairs – four-flusher!</p>
<p><strong>clint</strong>: No man can run a bluff on me.</p>
<p><strong>pap</strong>: He wasn’t armed.</p>
<p><strong>cap</strong>: I don’t like to tell men how to play cards
unless I’m settin’ in – but I mebbe ought to have spoken up. That Queen
was dead, Clint – and you know it.</p>
<p><strong>clint</strong>: When anybody plays poker with me, they play
my game or not at all.</p>
<p><strong>cap</strong>: You can’t just go makin’ your own rules, Clint
– – an’ if I was you I’d hightail outa here before he comes back.</p>
<p><strong>clint</strong>: Comes back?</p>
<p><strong>cap</strong>: He’s the kind.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: I’ve come for my money.</p>
<p><strong>clint</strong>: It’s all yours, mister – Cap, there – Cap is
an old gambler – he says you were right all the time.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: By the way, Judge – the name is
Rocklin.</p>
<p><strong>singer’s voice</strong>: She was only a bird in a gilded
cage…</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: How you feelin’?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: After that singin’? – Thirsty.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: How’s your head?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Oh – a mite hungover – but I’ll feel better
once I git downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>bob clews</strong>: I knocked, but guess you didn’t hear
me.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>bob clews</strong>: Looks like you stirred things up around
here last night, stranger.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: That all you came to say?</p>
<p><strong>bob clews</strong>: No. I got a message for you. From Old Man
Harolday. Wants to see you out front.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: What about?</p>
<p><strong>bob clews</strong>: Maybe he wants to thank you for teaching
that pup of his a lesson.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: I’ll be down.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: What’s goin’ on here?</p>
<p><strong>pap fossler</strong>: Arly Harolday’s on the warpath.</p>
<p><strong>ad libs</strong>: Here he comes. Watch the fun. This should
be good. Etc.</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: Is your name Rocklin?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: I want that money you took from my brother
last night.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Are you crazy? Or just ignorant?</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: You took it at the point of a gun – – and I’m
taking it back the same way!</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: Stop! You! stop, or I’ll kill you!</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: Turn around.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Whiskey!</p>
<p><strong>clint</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: You lied to me, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: Don’t think I’ll forget this. Making a fool of
me in front of the whole town.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Boy, oh boy, was that a near thing! She’d just
as soon have hit you as missed. You don’t know how lucky you were,
son.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Don’t I? Why d’you think I need this?</p>
<p><strong>bob clews</strong>: Funniest sight I ever seen.</p>
<p><strong>bob clews</strong>: You broke it! You broke it!</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Try another trick like that on me and it’ll
be worse.</p>
<p><strong>bob clews</strong>: I never played you no trick. You broke my
wrist.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Oh boy – has somebody come to town!</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Where’ll I find Judge Garvey?</p>
<p><strong>cap</strong>: He rooms behind his office down the street.
Don’t usually pull up the blinds till around noon, though.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: He will this morning. See you later,
old-timer…</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: Oh, come in, Mr. Rocklin. Come right in.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: I understand you were Red Caldwell’s
lawyer?</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: I was.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Know anything about this?</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: I don’t understand. Job? What job?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Foreman.</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: On the “K.C.”? But – but why should he want
you?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Why not? Good foremen don’t grow on
bushes.</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: Is that your only motive for coming
here?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: What other motive could I have?</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: I don’t know – It’s just that Red Caldwell
was a peculiar man – had a funny way of doing things.</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: Well, I’m sorry, Mr. Rocklin, that you’ve
been brought all this way on a fool’s errand, but – I’m afraid the
deal’s off.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Off?</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: I don’t want to be too hard on you, but as
executor of the estate I have to consider the interests of the new
owner. How about, say, a hundred in full settlement?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Well –</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: That’s my last word – think it over.</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: How do you do, ladies –</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: You are Judge Garvey, I presume.</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: Yes – and you are –</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: Miss Martin – and my niece, Clara
Caldwell.</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: Of course – of course –</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: You came at a very opportune moment, madam.
This gentleman claims to have some sort of a letter from the late
Mr. Caldwell, engaging him as foreman of the “K.C.”</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: What!</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: What do you mean – claims to have? – You
saw it, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: You can’t hold us to account for every
promise made by that man. Everyone knows he wasn’t responsible for his
actions half the time. And if you think I’d have you as a foreman –</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Listen, lady – I’d rather walk for somebody
else, than ride for you.</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: Well – the impudence –</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: All I come for this morning was to pay beck
the hundred and fifty Red Caldwell sent in advance.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Oh, no</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: Don’t interfere, Clara. Of course he
must pay it back.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: The railway fare – well, I reckon we can
check that up against the time lost and call it quits.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: But, Mr. – er – I don’t know your name…</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Rocklin, miss.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Mr. Rocklin, it isn’t fair for you to pay
anything back.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: That’s how I’d prefer it, If you don’t
mind, miss – never did care fer owing favors to no one – especially
women.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: I’ve just heard they let George Clews out of
penitentiary and that he’s headed this way. You might tell him from me,
if he sets foot on the Santee Ranch, I’ll shoot him on sight.</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: But really, Miss Arly, why should you
deliver your message through me?</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: You have mutual friends.</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: If you’re referring to Sheriff Jackson…</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: I am.</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: But that’s absurd. The fact that he employs
one of the Clews brothers doesn’t make the other his friend.</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: Have it your own way; but it’d be fair to warn
him, because I mean it.</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: Oh, Miss Caldwell, this is Miss Harolday –
Miss Martin, Miss Caldwell’s aunt. You should know one another, seeing
you’ll be neighbors. Miss Harolday runs the Santee Ranch for her
stepfather. She’s a famous – ah – horsewoman in these parts.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: I know. I saw you ride into town this
morning. You looked lovely. Just what I’d like to be.</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Oh, this is Mr. Rocklin. He drove us in from
Garden City last night. He…</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: I already met Miss Harolday.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: I’ve a message for you – from Harolday.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: What, again?</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: He wants you to come down to the office.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: He’s got a proposition to make – about riding
for him. Sixty a month.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Hmmm – That’s a foreman’s wages.</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: I wouldn’t offer you a red cent. But it’s his
money. And the way things are shaping, maybe we could do with somebody
as mean as you around the ranch.</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: I warn you, you’re making a great
mistake. This man is no good.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Auntie!</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: Well? D’you want the job?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Lead the way.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Auntie, why did you have to say that? I
simply don’t understand you…</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: But I understand you. I’d be ashamed of
myself. Throwing myself at a man like that.</p>
<p><strong>i… i…</strong>: Oh, you’re horrid – horrid. I wish I’d never
come.</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: You must excuse her. She’s young.</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: And inexperienced.</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: And young people must be protected from
themselves at times – don’t you agree?</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Does he always follow you?</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: He’s not following me – he’s with me – he’s
always with me.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Oh – just an old Indian friend.</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: The best friend I’ve got.</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: Wait here.</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: I’ve just hired a man named Rocklin and said
you made me do it. Sixty dollars and he ’ll earn it – while he
lasts.</p>
<p><strong>harolday</strong>: Why did you do it, Arly?</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: So I can fire him. I hate him. Clint and he
quarrelled last night. Clint lied about it and I made a fool of myself.
He’s outside now.</p>
<p><strong>harolday</strong>: All right. Send him in.</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>harolday</strong>: Mr. Rocklin, what happened between you and
my son last night?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Poker.</p>
<p><strong>harolday</strong>: Hmmm. About this suggestion of you working
for me.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: It’s your suggestion, not mine.</p>
<p><strong>harolday</strong>: Ye-es. Sixty dollars is big money.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: If you’ve changed your mind…</p>
<p><strong>harolday</strong>: No, no…. Wait a minute. I take it you’ve
had the experience.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Enough for Red Caldwell to hire me as
foreman.</p>
<p><strong>harolday</strong>: Oh – had Caldwell hired you?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Yeah – but I won’t ride for the new owners
– so that leaves me open.</p>
<p><strong>harolday</strong>: I see – Were you a friend of Red’s?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: No – I guess he just heard about me.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: George Clews is in town. He’s seen what you
done to Bob and he’s a- lookin’ for you.</p>
<p><strong>harolday</strong>: The street is clear.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Tell him I’ll be out in the street in front
of the saloon.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Uh-huh!</p>
<p><strong>george clews</strong>: I’m gonna get his ears.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Hi you, George Clews –</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Rocklin says if you don’t come out, he’ll come
in here after you, an’ tear you apart.</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: That was my beer, you know.</p>
<p><strong>george clews</strong>: If he comes in again – I’ll throw
you.</p>
<p><strong>cap</strong>: That does it, boys – you know where the door
is.</p>
<p><strong>george clews</strong>: Com-mon – I’ll get his ears.</p>
<p><strong>cap</strong>: Not until I get my money –</p>
<p><strong>cap</strong>: There’s three drinks and a broken beer
glass.</p>
<p><strong>george clews</strong>: Pay ’im.</p>
<p><strong>george clews</strong>: I’ll get his ears.</p>
<p><strong>pap</strong>: That Rocklin’ll kill him for sure.</p>
<p><strong>customer</strong>: Le’s hope.</p>
<p><strong>george clews</strong>: I’m coming – and you’d better run!</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Draw a gun and I’ll kill you.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: Hey, you! What’s this you been up to?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: I just laid a gun barrel over the head of a
drunk friend of yours – same as you did over Dave’s here yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Eh?</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: I don’t know what you’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: You’re a liar!</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: Now you lookee here, young feller. You go
on talking that way and you’ll find yourself in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: Don’t say you ain’t been warned.</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: I saw you. I saw you strike that poor
man.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Yes, ma’am. As hard as I could.</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: You ruffian, you!</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: Let me go! I knew the sort you were the
moment I set eyes on you. You can’t fool me! You’re nothing but a common
adventurer! Come, Clara!</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: – Now what was that you were sayin’ about
Caldwell?</p>
<p><strong>harolday</strong>: You being hired by Red Caldwell only
confirms what I’d suspected – he was getting ready to fight.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Fight? Who?</p>
<p><strong>harolday</strong>: Organized rustling. Well at least – that’s
my belief. Red was no friend of mine. Too fond of taking the law into
his own hands. But he had my sympathy. He’d been harder hit than any of
us. And on top of it all, he lost his foreman.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: You mean, he quit on him?</p>
<p><strong>harolday</strong>: He was shot – in the back – with a bullet
from the same caliber rifle as got Red.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Got any ideas?</p>
<p><strong>harolday</strong>: No – Except that the man you just
pistol-whipped is in on it somewhere. Pity you didn’t kill him when you
had the chance.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Say – it don’t sound as if it’s goin’ to be
too easy for them wimmen at the K.C.</p>
<p><strong>harolday</strong>: Want to go back and work for them?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: No, sir. And I ain’t jumping at this offer
o’ yours either because I don’t hold with working for wimmen.</p>
<p><strong>harolday</strong>: Oh, you mean my step-daughter. Well don’t
worry. She won’t interfere with you…Rocklin – I figure we’ve been losin’
cattle over a place called Table Top – it’s the back way into the Topaz
Ranch and the perfect route for rustlers – I’m going to send you up to
the line camp – you don’t mind working a lone hand – do you?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: – I like workin’ that way.</p>
<p><strong>harolday</strong>: Good – be ready to move out this
afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: – now Pap – I’m givin’ you first call on me
services. They’s lots of other folks lookin’ fer a good man, too – you
know. So if you want me, you better hurry and speak up because –</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: ’scuse me, Pap – Be right back to find out
when I start.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Whar you off to?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: I’m riding for the Topaz Ranch.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: What! – Have you gone plumb loco?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Good money – sixty a month</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: There ain’t enough money in this town to make
it worth your while to work for that gal.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: When she gits goin’ she can be meaner’n a
skillet full o’ snakes. She ain’t goin’ to forget the way you made a
fool of her today – in front of the whole town.</p>
<p><strong>pap fossler’s voice</strong>: Hey, Dave.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Be right with you. It’s pizen that’s what it
is – jus’ plain — What you want to hang around this town for anyways?
–</p>
<p><strong>pap fossler’s voice</strong>: Hey, Dave.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Be right with you.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Good afternoon, Mr. Rocklin. Lovely day,
isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Reckon it is pretty nice. So you’re moving
in on the “K.C.” eh?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: throwing a look toward</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: Do you have to discuss our private
affairs with every rag-tag-and-bobtail cow-person we meet, Clara?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Auntie!</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Sorry if I butted in, ma’am. Jest passing
the time o’day.</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: We can do very well without it – thank
you. And you’re keeping your lady friend waiting.</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: I thought maybe you’d changed your mind
again.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: Juan’ll show you the bunkhouse. I’ll talk to
you about your duties in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: How far is the line-camp at Table- Top?</p>
<p><strong>juan</strong>: Twenty-five – thirty mile.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: I’m moving out there first thing in the
morning. Boss’ orders. Care to show me the way?</p>
<p><strong>juan</strong>: I will show you.</p>
<p><strong>juan</strong>: The trail is straight ahead. You will find the
cabin at the top. Adios, Senor.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Senor Romerez, it appears that you do not
like me.</p>
<p><strong>juan</strong>: Senor, that is true. I do not like you.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>juan</strong>: Permit that I offer you a cigarette.</p>
<p><strong>juan</strong>: It is not your fault that your shadow is
black. But you will only bring unhappiness to my senorita. I do not
blame you, but I fear I must hate you.</p>
<p><strong>juan</strong>: Adios, Senor.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Hiya there.</p>
<p><strong>juan</strong>: Buenos dias, Senor Dave. You have found new
employer, eh?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Yeah. Haulin’ freight for ole Pap Fossler. Got
a letter here for that crazy galoot, Rocklin. From the little Caldwell
girl. Seems mighty took up about sumpin’. Made me promise to deliver it
personal.</p>
<p><strong>juan</strong>: But Senor Rocklin is not here.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Lordy – he ain’t quit already…</p>
<p><strong>juan</strong>: I have just accompany him to Table- Top.</p>
<p><strong>clint</strong>: Have you seen Arly?</p>
<p><strong>shelley</strong>: No, suh, Ah didn’t see Miss Arly today, but
Ah seed her las’ night, and she shore was mad.</p>
<p><strong>shelley</strong>: Plenty mad!</p>
<p><strong>clint</strong>: ‘Mornin’, Arly –</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: ‘Mornin’, Clint.</p>
<p><strong>clint</strong>: You must be feeling pretty good.</p>
<p><strong>clint</strong>: Say, Arly – about that poker game, night
before last, I —</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>clint</strong>: Forget it?</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: Tala.</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: Well –</p>
<p><strong>clint</strong>: What is this? –</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>clint</strong>: What do I mean? –</p>
<p><strong>tala’s voice</strong>: Good morning, Arliete.</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: Good morning, Tala.</p>
<p><strong>tala</strong>: You have make yourself very pretty today.</p>
<p><strong>clint</strong>: See what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: Have my horse saddled and sent around right
away – will you? You can have that Rocklin bring it.</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>tala</strong>: Rocklin is not here.</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: He quit?</p>
<p><strong>tala</strong>: He has gone to the line camp at Table Top.</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>tala</strong>: It was Mr. Harolday’s orders.</p>
<p><strong>tala</strong>: Why do you make your heart heavy with thoughts
of him, little one. – He is not for you.</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: Be quiet.</p>
<p><strong>tala</strong>: He has made the choice, Arliete. With your own
eyes you saw it yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: Oh –</p>
<p><strong>tala</strong>: And she, too, has opened her heart to him –
Already she has summoned him to her.</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>tala</strong>: Dave – of the white beard – carries a letter
to Rocklin – It is from her.</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: How do you know that?</p>
<p><strong>tala</strong>: I have just now met Dave, and he tell me. – So
now he rides to Table Top.</p>
<p><strong>tala</strong>: Little one you –</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: Oh, leave me alone.</p>
<p><strong>harolday</strong>: Good morning, Julio – morning Arly. Fetch
my briefcase – it’s on my desk.</p>
<p><strong>harolday</strong>: Looks like we’re going to get that land
we’ve been wanting along the river bottom.</p>
<p><strong>harolday</strong>: I didn’t tell you – but I bought the
mortgage on the Hardman ranch, and it’s due today – On my way over there
now.</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: Did you send that Rocklin to Table- Top?</p>
<p><strong>harolday</strong>: I did.</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: Well, let’s get things straight. This place
was my mother’s – now it’s mine and Clint’s – It’s true you’ve been
helping out – but the way things are going we’ll soon be able to pay you
back every penny we owe. Meanwhile, I’m running this outfit and I expect
to give the orders.</p>
<p><strong>harolday</strong>: You generally do.</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: Why did you send Rocklin up to Table- Top?</p>
<p><strong>harolday</strong>: It seemed to me a good idea – what with
all this rustling going on –</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: Who’d ever try driving cattle over Table-Top?
– Unless they were crazy.</p>
<p><strong>harolday</strong>: I don’t agree with you. In any case – if
you must have it – I’d no intention of engaging a man at foreman’s wages
just to gratify the whims of a jealous woman!</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: You take care what you’re saying.</p>
<p><strong>harolday</strong>: It’s you should take care, my dear. I’m
afraid there’s one man you can’t rawhide into jumping the way you want.
You’ve made a fool of yourself over him once. Better watch out you don’t
do it again.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Durn funny – that storm quittin’ just about
the time I get here.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: No funnier than you sloggin’ through it,
just to deliver a letter from a woman.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Reckon I’m gettin’ to be more of a fool the
older I get.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: When are we gonna get around to readin’
it?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Thought I’d wait till mornin’ – might be
bad news an’ I wouldn’t be able to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Mmmm – dineroo.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin’s voice</strong>: Forgive me if this letter is a
trifle incoherent, but I am terribly worried and unhappy.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Who wouldn’t be – livin’ with that ole screech
owl.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: I am desperately in need of help and advice
from someone whom I feel I can trust, and I am appealing to you, because
I regard you in the same way my Uncle surely must have. I heartily
dislike and distrust Judge Garvey –</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Huh – Smart girl –</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: But my Aunt seems to have suddenly revised
her opinion of him, and now wants me to place all my affairs in the
Judge’s hands and return east. Such is certainly not my wish.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Looks kinda like she’s formed an
attachment.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: For the locality, I mean.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: I wanted so much to give ranch life a
trial, but fear circumstances are against me, especially in view of the
recent Indian trouble –</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Indian trouble – Good Lord, they ain’t been
any Indian trouble around here in –</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: You want to hear the rest of this?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Might’s well – come this far.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: I want to apologize for what took place
this afternoon. And I am returning the 150, because I feel it is
rightfully yours. You must take it. Faithfully yours, Clara
Caldwell.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Well – what do you make of it?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Somebody’s sure bustin’ to get her out of
there.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Indian trouble –</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Wonder why the old lady’s playin’
along?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Baaa – Wimmen – Who can ever figure ’em? Got
to admit though, I feel a mite sorry for the young’un – nice little
tyke.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Too nice for this country.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: She’s shore a pretty thing.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Don’t know how I could help her – even if I
wanted to – I don’t know any thing about this Garvey – or Caldwell – or
–</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Well, now – I could mebbe help you out some,
there – Fact, I could tell you somethin’ ‘bout ole Red that might be
interestin’.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: You must have known him pretty well – What
kind of a man was he?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Caldwell? – The best – cantankerous cuss – but
a real cowman, believe me – He was a big feller, like yourself – Fact,
you coulda passed fer a blood relation, come to think of it.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: himself with the</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: That’s what you’d say. Garvey managed all
Red’s business. Besides which they was regular drinkin’ pals – played
poker together most nights – tho’ they do say Red got the worst of
it.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Red was a gambler, eh?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Oh, yeah – reckon a pretty poor one, tho’ –
still you’d say him and Garvey was friends.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Anything ever happen to make you think they
weren’t?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Rock – I’m gonna tell you somethin’ I ain’t
never told anybody.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Think you can trust me?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: The last time I seen Red was the day he died
–</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: – ‘Twas in town – he jus’ come out of the
stage office. Tried to book passage to Garden City but couldn’t on
account I had a full load. – Well, sir, he took me aside and give me a
printed sheet of paper and says, “Read it.” I looked it over and fer as
I could see it was a paper from one of them Chicago sportin’ firms,
tellin’ how to manipulate trick playin’ cards.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Marked cards.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Reckon so. – Seems Red found some cards and
this paper in a coat one of his friends loaned him one night.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Whose was it?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Well, now that’s just what I asked – but all
he said, was that it belonged to a good friend. Then he said he wasn’t
waitin’ fer the next coach, but was ridin’ over to see the district
judge about it alone.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: That’s when they got him.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Yes, sir – ‘bout a mile or so from Stan’s
place. A bullet in the back an’ his pockets empty.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: How come you never told this before?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Who was there to tell? – Sheriff Jackson? –
Him an’ Garvey’s thick as thieves.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: How about what’s his name – Harolday? –
He’s no friend of the Judge’s, is he?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Hates his guts – sure riles him to see young
Clint hangin’ onto the Judge’s coattails. All the same, I jus’ decided
to keep my mouth shut and my eyes open.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Even if it was Garvey Red was talkin’ about
– it don’t follow that he killed him.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: No – general opinion is that it was
rustlers.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Why would rustlers take the evidence
Caldwell had with him?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Looks to me if you get the man who owned the
marked cards, you get the killer.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Funny tho’ – first the K.C. foreman – then
Caldwell – an’ now these women.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Lordy – you ain’t thinkin’ somebody might try
bumpin’ them?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: I’m not so sure somebody hasn’t tried
already – Remember, when we stopped to change horses on the way Over
from Garden City –</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Shore – you told me how Jackson and Clews
tried to frame Stan.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Yeah. Like they wanted to be sure he’d keep
his mouth shut about something.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: And layin’ that gun across my skull – an’
offerin’ to drive the coach themselves.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: It was almost as if –</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: You all right?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Will be if I ever get dry.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Lookit that –</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Good Lord –</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Come on –</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: My team.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: That’s not your team.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Come on –</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: No use – he’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Mebbe we winged him.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Not bad shootin’.</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: You think I did that?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Sure – to draw us away from here. You know,
you cut it mighty close – Good thing I ain’t got brains enough to fill
it.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Too bad you had to come ‘way up here
through that storm for nothin’.</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: I haven’t minded a bit – – because I came up
to fire you.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Oh – I see.</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: Get out of here – get off the Santee and don’t
ever come back.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Mind if I wait for Dave? He ought to be
along any minute – Be funny if he winged that shadow of yours.</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: If you mean Juan – you’re loco. He’s not even
up here.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: You came up alone?</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Then who was that we took out after?</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: The man who shot at you.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Who was he?</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: You mean you won’t tell.</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: I mean I don’t know – Why should I lie to
you?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: I guess you forgot – you jes’ fired me.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: So long.</p>
<p><strong>dave’s voice</strong>: Hey, Rock –</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: – He got away – but guess what, I –</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: You guess –</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Fer a man who’s got a despise fer wimmin, you
sure do get all snaggled up with ’em.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: You work for Harolday?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Here’s one of his horses – I’ll pick up my
saddle later.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Howdy…</p>
<p><strong>harolday</strong>: I thought I sent you up to Table- Top.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>harolday</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Well, this, for one thing.</p>
<p><strong>harolday</strong>: I told you you’d regret letting that rat
Clews off so easy.</p>
<p><strong>harolday</strong>: What’s the matter? Don’t you think it was
him, then?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: I been figgerin’. Don’t seem reasonable
Clews was in condition to take that sort of chance alone… Besides – how
could he have known I was up there – that soon. And – George Clews ain’t
the only one I’ve run contrariwise to in this town. There’s that
Mexican, for instance.</p>
<p><strong>harolday</strong>: Juan?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: He as good as told me yesterday that him
and me was due for a run-in one of those days. And then there’s him!</p>
<p><strong>clint</strong>: I just heard that – that Rocklin was –</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Was what?</p>
<p><strong>clint</strong>: Was shot at last night.</p>
<p><strong>harolday</strong>: Mr. Rocklin was just telling me all about
it. Any idea who might have done it?</p>
<p><strong>clint</strong>: Not me.</p>
<p><strong>clint</strong>: You ain’t trying to pin it on me? ’Cause if
you are, you’re in for a big disappointment. I was over at the Sun-Up
playing poker with the Judge and the rest of the boys till early
morning. If you don’t believe me, ask for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: All right. I believe you. But that don’t
mean you couldn’t tell a thing or two as would help – if you wanted.</p>
<p><strong>clint</strong>: What d’you mean?</p>
<p><strong>harolday</strong>: Yes. What sort of thing would Clint here
know about, that would help identify the man who tried to kill you last
night?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: This for one.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Ever seen it before?</p>
<p><strong>harolday</strong>: Well, go on – speak up. Did you ever see
it before?</p>
<p><strong>clint</strong>: No. Course I didn’t Quit riding me! I don’t
know nothin’ about it I tell you. Jest because I had a run-in with you
over a game o’ cards, that don’t mean I’d sneak up on you in the dark
and…</p>
<p><strong>harolday</strong>: He means trouble.</p>
<p><strong>clint</strong>: Aw, what do I care.</p>
<p><strong>harolday</strong>: Listen, I never did have much use for you.
You’re a poor specimen at the best; but as a would-be bad man you’re
nothing but a laughing stock. Why, the way you lied about that pouch
just now wouldn’t have deceived a six-year old.</p>
<p><strong>harolday</strong>: All right, let it go at that. But I got
myself to think of. It wouldn’t suit me at all just now to have you
shown up in public for what you are by that trouble-shootin’ cowhand. My
advice to you is to get out of the district and stay out. You’ll find
some money in the safe at the ranch. Take what you need and put the key
in the desk drawer. Now get.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Oh, Mr. Rocklin –</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: I’m so glad I’ve found you – I was on my way
to the Santee and learned you were in town.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Just got in.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: I feel perfectly awful, running after you
like this, but –</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: You got trouble, eh?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: My aunt found out I wrote you and made a
terrible scene –</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: You haven’t signed everything over to that
Garvey, have you?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: No – and because I refused, Auntie said she
would sign an affidavit that I’m still underage, and then, as my
guardian she can do what she likes.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Got anything to prove you’re not
underage?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: No – but Mr. Garvey has a letter that would
prove it. My aunt wrote it before we came out here.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: S’pose we could get it?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: He’d never give it to me.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Wait here.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Oh, please – you – You won’t go getting
yourself in trouble – I – I’d rather give up everything – I mean –</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: That takes care of that – Now, I’ll draw up
an affidavit right away and everything will be taken care of as we want
it.</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: I certainly hope so – it’s not myself
I’m concerned about –</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: – Of course not.</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: I can’t say I’m very happy about doing
this – I only hope it works out for the best.</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: It’s the better choice of two evils – now
let’s see – I, Elizabeth – It is Elizabeth, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: Yes –</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: – Elizabeth Martin, of Danvers,
Massachusetts, do hereby –</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: Well, Mr. Rocklin, this is indeed a
surprise. Didn’t expect to see you so soon. I understood you were riding
for the Santee.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: Perhaps you’d better come back later –</p>
<p><strong>rocklin’s voice</strong>: I came for that letter.</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: Did you say letter?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: That’s right – the one Miss Caldwell’s aunt
wrote from out east sayin’ she was of age. Remember?</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: No – I’m afraid I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: What is your interest in this letter?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: My only interest is getting’ it.</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: You realize what this is, don’t you? –
Robbing – armed robbery at that.</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: I warn you, you’re in for a
disappointment.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Open up.</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: Listens, you – There’s nothing in there
that’d interest you.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: I’d like to make up my own mind about
that.</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: All right – I’ll open it – just to convince
you I’m not hiding any letter.</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: What’s the idea?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: These cards –</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: Anything wrong in a man having cards in his
possession?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Depends on what kind they are – ’specially
when they’re under lock and key.</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: You’re taking those, I presume.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: Now, you look here –</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: You’re the one who better start lookin’ –
lookin’ for a way out for killin’ Red Caldwell.</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: Caldwell –</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: He found out about these – and you went and
killed him.</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: smile and unnatural</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: I will until I hear a better one. I’ll just
take this along – the district judge at Garden City should be mighty
interested.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Say – looks like you two been disagreein’
‘bout somethin’ – He ain’t daid, is he?</p>
<p><strong>pap fossler</strong>: Not permanently, I don’t reckon. – What
happened, anyways?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: You musta found out somethin’.</p>
<p><strong>pap fossler</strong>: I reckon the Judge did, too.</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: Oh, dear – dear – are you hurt?</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: Get out of my way –</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: Now don’t you use that tone of voice to
me – I’ll have you understand I –</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: – Find out who owns that tobaccy pouch
yet?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: No – but get hold of Clint Harolday.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Clint – Is he in on it?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Can’t say for sure – Bring him to the
Sun-Up, and don’t take no for an answer.</p>
<p><strong>arly’s voice</strong>: – So now you know the truth. And if
you think you can steal him away from me, you’re welcome to try it.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Did you get it?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: No – but I don’t think it’s gonna matter
much – you go on back to the K.C. and I’ll be out in the mornin’ and
take you with me to Garden City to see the district judge.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: But I hate putting you to that trouble.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: No trouble at all – I’m going anyway.</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: You look like you’ve been fighting.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: What are you doin’ here?</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: I was just telling Miss Caldwell about – well
– you and me.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: What about, you an’ me?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: I think I’d better be going…</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Just a minute – What all has she been
tellin’ you?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Oh – oh, really I’d rather not –</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: Go ahead, tell him – – and I dare him to deny
it.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Deny what?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: That she was with you last night at the cabin
in the mountains.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Well – why should I deny it?…</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: And didn’t you make love to me?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Make love to you –</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: You didn’t kiss me – I suppose?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Did you expect me to deny that, too?</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: You see?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Now, maybe you ought to hear what I’ve got
to say –</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Please – you needn’t explain. After all, it
really isn’t any of my business, is it?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: You little –</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: That’s it – start swearin’– Just like a
man.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: If there wasn’t a lady here, I’d do more to
you than swear.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: I don’t know how I can ever thank you for
trying to help me. I do appreciate it ever so much – Don’t think too
harshly of me, will you – I –</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: She’s lovely, isn’t she? – So sweet – honest,
and helpless.</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: Pity you didn’t fall in love with her, instead
of me.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: You might’s well know right now that you or
no woman is ever goin’ to get me.</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: Don’t be so sure – I don’t think I’m doin’ so
badly.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: Don’t you know?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: I know there ain’t a dirty trick you
wouldn’t play to get what you want.</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: I always get what I want.</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: – See? – ’Bye now –</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: Whatever is to become of you?</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: Have you no sense of pride, or decency?
Throwing yourself at that – that wretch, like any shameless hussy.</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: I thought we’d done with him – but no –
you have to run to him and tell him all our business –</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: Don’t you dare deny it – you know very
well you told him about that letter I wrote Mr. Garvey.</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: Didn’t you? –</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: Didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: Tell Miss Martin that I’ll take care of
everything.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: – You take clare of evelything.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Come in –</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Here he is, Rock. Caught him jist in time near
the Santee. Headed fer out, I’d say.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Sit down, Clint. How about goin’ down below
an’ havin’ one on me?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Well, now – that’s right thoughtful – Holler
if you need me.</p>
<p><strong>clint</strong>: What’s this all about?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: It ain’t gonna do you any good to get all
het up and tough, kid –</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: I just want to ask you a few questions –
that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>clint</strong>: I told you once, I don’t know who owns that
pouch– and I don’t know who shot you.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Forget it – that’s not what I want to talk
to you about, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>clint</strong>: Well, what do you want to talk about? Come
on, get it over with.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Clint – I want you to tell me why Garvey
murdered Red Caldwell –</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: You know – don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>clint</strong>: Me? No!</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Oh yes you do. And you’re going to tell me
all about it.</p>
<p><strong>clint</strong>: I don’t know nothing, I tell you –</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Talk!</p>
<p><strong>clint</strong>: I tell ya, I…</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Talk!</p>
<p><strong>clint</strong>: No! No, don’t!</p>
<p><strong>ad libs</strong>: What happened? Who is it? Clint Harolday –
Etc.</p>
<p><strong>pap fossler</strong>: Where’s Doc Riding?</p>
<p><strong>ad libs</strong>: Get the Doc. Hey, Doc – He was down below.
Here he is.</p>
<p><strong>doc riding’s voice</strong>: Here I am –</p>
<p><strong>ad libs</strong>: Look out, men – Let the Doc through.
Etc.</p>
<p><strong>doc riding</strong>: Somebody better fetch Harolday.</p>
<p><strong>cap</strong>: Shorty’s already gone for him.</p>
<p><strong>pap fossler</strong>: Better get Arly, too.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: She was at the hotel a while ago.</p>
<p><strong>pap fossler</strong>: He was only a kid.</p>
<p><strong>jackson’s voice</strong>: What’s goin’ on here – gang way
–</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: What’s the trouble here –</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: I warned you, didn’t I? – Well, I guess
this is the last trouble you’ll ever make in this town. Hand over that
gun.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Just a minute, now –</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: I know it looks bad – but I didn’t kill the
kid.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: I believe you. His gun was layin’ over there
on the floor when I come in and –</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: No it wasn’t – It was right in my hand –
like it is now.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: If you didn’t know him – then who did?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: I don’t know – But I’m going to find
out.</p>
<p><strong>harolday</strong>: Where is he? – Where’s my boy?</p>
<p><strong>harolday</strong>: You murderer.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: I didn’t do it, Mr. Harolday.</p>
<p><strong>harolday</strong>: Then who did?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: He had a gun in his hand when we come in.</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: And I’ll bet it’s the same one the bullet
that killed Clint came out of.</p>
<p><strong>harolday</strong>: Well, what do you say to that?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: He’s right.</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: You admit it.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Yeah – but that still don’t say I killed
him.</p>
<p><strong>ad libs</strong>: Aw, take him away – Liar – Lock him up,
Sheriff – The yellow-bellied – Etc.</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: Why did you do it?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: He admits it was his gun that shot him.</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: But you didn’t fire it.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Clint and me was having a bit of an
argument.</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: What about?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: About whether he was going to help clear up
a few things that’s been bothering me and some others ’round these
parts. For instance – who it was shot Red Caldwell.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: Caldwell!</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: And the K.C. foreman. And who took that
shot at me up at Table-Top last night. And why certain people are so
anxious to get rid of the Caldwell girl.</p>
<p><strong>pap fossler</strong>: How would Clint know about all
that?</p>
<p><strong>harolday</strong>: He’s lying. He’s trying to cover up for
killing my boy.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: Quit stalling, Rocklin.</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: Wait a minute – he’s get a right to be heard.
Well, we’re listenin’.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Well – Clint was getting’ all set to talk,
when – somebody snuck up along the verandah there and pulled the gun out
o’ my belt… … and let him have it.</p>
<p><strong>ad libs</strong>: What a story! What an alibi! String him up,
the heel! Etc.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: You’ll have to think up something better
than that Rocklin.</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: Don’t be a fool, Rocklin. You know you can’t
get away with a yarn like that. Why don’t you save yourself and everyone
else a lot of trouble by surrendering to the Sheriff? After all, it
isn’t such a crime in these parts to kill a man in self-defense.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Self-defense?</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: Everyone knows what Clint was like. He
probably lost his head and pulled a gun on you, like he did at the Sun-
Up that night. Wasn’t that it?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: No, that wasn’t it. And till I do what I
got to do, I ain’t surrenderin’ to anybody – least of all to your pal
here. If I got to be shot for knowing too much, it ain’t going to be in
the back, in a framed-up jail-break.</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: But if someone’s trying to kill you, why
didn’t they do it just now? Why did they have to kill Clint?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Guess they wanted to get Clint, too. Doin’
it this way they get us both. Clint first – an’ me afterwards – like I
jus’ said.</p>
<p><strong>pap fossler</strong>: Quit fancy talk. Who’s “they?”</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: I might be able to tell you that later.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: No you won’t – because you’re comin’ with
me.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Am I?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: The first one that moves – gets it.</p>
<p><strong>harolday</strong>: Well, Sheriff – you certainly are to be
congratulated.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: Look, Mr. Harolday – you saw what happened
–</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: Never mind that – Let’s get going for Garden
City – that’s where he’s headed for.</p>
<p><strong>harolday</strong>: You sure?</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: I’m positive.</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: Where do you think he’s gone?</p>
<p><strong>jackson’s voice</strong>: All right, men – follow me –</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: I mighta knowed you’d do somethin’ like this.
What are we doin’?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Headin’ for the K.C.</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: Now – what is it?</p>
<p><strong>george clews</strong>: The name’s Clews, ma’am – Mr. Garvey
sent us out –</p>
<p><strong>bob clews</strong>: Said you were expectin’ trouble with that
Rocklin.</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: I am. – But I’m wondering if you’re up
to it. I noticed you didn’t fare so well with him yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>bob clews</strong>: He was drunk –</p>
<p><strong>george clews</strong>: Yeah – But I’m sober now.</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: Well, see that you stay that way.</p>
<p><strong>george clews</strong>: Don’t worry, ma’am – I’ve jus’ bin
waitin’ to get even with that saddle- bum.</p>
<p><strong>bob clews</strong>: We’ll be close-by.</p>
<p><strong>george clews</strong>: You bet.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: Seen anybody ridin’ hard for Garden
City.</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: Bin on the road since sundown – ain’t seen a
livin’ soul – be he man or beast.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: He mighta taken the cutoff through Jaw Bone
Canyon.</p>
<p><strong>harolday</strong>: After that storm? – He’d never make
it.</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: There’s only one other place he might have
gone – the K.C.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: You think so?</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: I’m positive.</p>
<p><strong>harolday</strong>: That’s what you said before.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: To the K.C., men.</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: Take me through the canyon.</p>
<p><strong>juan</strong>: It is dangerous, senorita.</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: But if we get through we’ll beat them to the
K.C.</p>
<p><strong>juan</strong>: You would risk your life for Senor
Rocklin?</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: Afraid?</p>
<p><strong>julio</strong>: Only for you – you must not do this – I will
go through from here alone.</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: No, – we’re going through together.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: You can ease up now.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: We’re just about there.</p>
<p><strong>bob clews</strong>: Hey, George – George, get up.</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: You vile, ungrateful strumpet – running
away in the night, like a deceitful sneak-thief –</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Yes – I’m running away – and it’s all your
fault – you’re the one who’s been deceitful and sneaking – and don’t
think I don’t know what you intend doing.</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: – And don’t think I don’t know what you
intend doing.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: I don’t care – I’m not ashamed of it – and
nothing you can say or do is going to stop me.</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: You little fool – if you go to Garden
City with that man – you stand to lose everything.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: But why? – Why are you being so secretive? –
If you know something, why don’t you tell me?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Yeah – why don’t you? –</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: All right, I’ll tell you – Rocklin is a
nephew of the late Mr. Caldwell. And, as nearest of kin, he stands to
get everything – according to the will. Because you are not the old
man’s niece, but only his grand-niece.</p>
<p><strong>miss martin’s voice</strong>: Rocklin turned up unexpectedly
–</p>
<p><strong>clara’s voice</strong>: And you and Mr. Garvey knew the truth
all the time?</p>
<p><strong>miss martin’s voice</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: – And you knew the truth all the time, too –
didn’t you? – No wonder you stuck around –</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Get in here and take care of her.</p>
<p><strong>george clews</strong>: Come on –</p>
<p><strong>julio</strong>: You are crying, senorita –?</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>julio</strong>: It is too bad we lose your horse. She was
good horse, for sure.</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: If only we make it in time.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: – And I heard one of them tell my aunt not to
worry, that he was just as anxious as she was to get even with you.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: This is the only way I could handle her.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: The Clews are around here some place –
Garvey sent ’em out.</p>
<p><strong>george clews</strong>: You bet we’re around.</p>
<p><strong>george clews</strong>: Untie her.</p>
<p><strong>bob clews</strong>: Untie her.</p>
<p><strong>george clews</strong>: Now tie him up.</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: I’ll take part in this – you – you
hairy beast.</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: Help me get her to the bed.</p>
<p><strong>george clews</strong>: What’ll we do with ’em?</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: Take them in to Mr. Garvey and tell him
I must see him at once.</p>
<p><strong>bob clews</strong>: We’ll dump them right in the Judge’s
lap.</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: Hadn’t you better tie him, too?</p>
<p><strong>george clews</strong>: Get some more rope.</p>
<p><strong>george clews</strong>: Get our horses and meet me at the
gate.</p>
<p><strong>george clews</strong>: What are you doin’ with that gun,
Arly?</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: Get down from there before I show you.</p>
<p><strong>george clews’ voice</strong>: Now listen, Arly – this ain’t
your wagon –</p>
<p><strong>arly’s voice</strong>: Neither is it yours – Get down out of
there – before I knock you down.</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: – And they’re headed this way and should get
here any minute –</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: Where’d you get this?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: That belongs to the man who shot at me on
Table-Top – Dave found it.</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: You’ve got to get away – they’ll be here –
they’ll catch you –</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: You’ve got to stop him – he’s got to get
away.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Come on – let’s git goin’ –</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Where’s the girl?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Back at the house –</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: We’ve got to get her.</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: You haven’t time – they’re coming – don’t you
believe me? –</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Come on –</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Stubborn as an ole mule. You’re puttin’ a rope
around your neck –</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: Get him – – out of sight, and follow me.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: But what’ll we do with the ole lady?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Anything you like.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: I’d like to pizen her.</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: Look.</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: If you’ll just take this – you’ll go to
sleep –</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: Evenin’ ma’am – hate to bother you like
this, but –</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: I’m so glad you’ve come, Mr. Garvey,
the most awful – – Why – what are all these people doing here?</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: We’re after Rocklin – has he been here?</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: Oh yes – here and gone.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: What!</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: Gone –</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: Yes – the two men you sent out are
taking him and that horrid old man back to town.</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: The Clewses – funny we didn’t see them.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: Somethin’ musta gone wrong – We better fan
out and see what’s goin’ on.</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: Don’t leave, Mr. Garvey – I’ve got to
talk with you, privately –</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: But, madam –</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: It’s very important.</p>
<p><strong>harolday</strong>: We’ll go on and meet you in town.</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: Perhaps you’d better. I’ll meet you in town,
Jackson.</p>
<p><strong>jackson’s voice</strong>: Right – come on, men.</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: – And you’re positive he knows
everything?</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: Absolutely everything – He was standing
at the window all the time – the scoundrel.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: You better get back on the bed – in case
they come in here.</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: If you were to ask me, I think the best
thing to do is –</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: I’m not asking you – and don’t bother me
with your silly questions – we’ve got to do something besides talk.</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: You mean – you have to do
something.</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: – This was all your idea, remember.</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: My idea – that’s all you know about it.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: If there’s anybody else in on it – speak
up, Judge.</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: Well – I do declare –</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Talk.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Not you.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Ever see that before?</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: No – it’s not mine.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Tell me whose it is.</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: No – no – I don’t know –</p>
<p><strong>arly’s voice</strong>: Drop that gun.</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: He was just getting ready to finish you off,
through that window.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: You seem to like to do business through
windows, Mr. Harolday.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: You’re not Clint’s killer, by any chance
–</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: By one bad chance – Juan saw you do it.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Well, now we’re gettin’ some place –</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: That pouch is his – Juan made it for him a
long time ago. Didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Why did you kill Caldwell?</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: – Harolday wanted the K.C. like he wanted
the Santee and the Hardman place, for his land scheme – He planned on
breaking up the ranches into small holdings and selling to dirt farmers.
He pretended to be on the outs with me so I could get Caldwell’s
confidence. And when Red caught me with the crooked cards and threatened
to expose me – Harolday shot him.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Why did he kill Clint? An’ not me?</p>
<p><strong>garvey</strong>: That shot was an accident – it was meant for
you. We planned on getting the women to let me handle their business
–</p>
<p><strong>miss martin</strong>: – And do us out of everything – You
vile – wicked – despicable –</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: When he wakes up – we’ll have him put
everything on paper.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Well, you’ll have to do the writin’ – ’cause I
don’t know how to write.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Oh, Mr. Rocklin – please – I think Auntie is
out of her mind – she’s in her room – laughing.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: What that ole pelican needs is a good
spankin’.</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: And I’ll bet you’re just the one who can do
it.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Yeah – I believe I am. I know I am.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: I guess there’s no rush for you to get to
Garden City, now –</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: No – I don’t suppose there’s any – rush –</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: If I was like her, I’d stay in the West.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: That means you’re goin’ back East – Cousin
Clara?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: It’s where I belong – I know that now –</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: It’s good to know where you Belong, I
reckon – Wish I knew.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: I can tell you – you belong with her –</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Everything.</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: Beautiful day.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: It didn’t start out so beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: That’s true of lots of things.</p>
<p><strong>rocklin</strong>: Fer instance?</p>
<p><strong>arly</strong>: Well – you and – me.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Hey, Rock – Rock – get out your pencil and
paper –</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Doggone it – here Garvey is back in this world
– an’ they’re out of it.</p>
