<p><strong>serna</strong>: Buzzy…Buzz…?</p>
<p><strong>padiche</strong>: Yeah…Sid?</p>
<p><strong>serna</strong>: You got clicks, anything?</p>
<p><strong>padiche</strong>: Nah, nuthin’ on my end–</p>
<p><strong>serna</strong>: –Okay…hang on, I gotta move–</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: Zoom and pan please. Stay tight.</p>
<p><strong>on the monitors</strong>: The image pans, follows a figure
moving behind the mansion’s windows, entering a back bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>serna</strong>: Alright, now Buzzy– this is, this is it,
here, okay, so listen to me careful and wait till I’m finished ’cuz we
got no room for slop.</p>
<p><strong>padiche</strong>: I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>serna</strong>: Okay, he’s gonna clip Israel, I just gotta
outta there–</p>
<p><strong>padiche</strong>: –he’s doing it then, huh–</p>
<p><strong>serna</strong>: –yeah, now lemme finish, I was eavesdroppin’,
so give me sec, lay this thing out, since the information might be a
little loose–</p>
<p><strong>padiche</strong>: –okay, g’head–</p>
<p><strong>serna</strong>: So what I heard downstairs there is that they
got a guy, some Swede, real badass, supposedly a “specialist” and
they’re bringing him over. Now he ain’t coming cheap– so, I’m thinkin’
we jump, do this in the next day or so, get to Israel before the Swede
can, we got chits, y’see? We’re in a power position. Grab him, ransom
him back, pick up that nut, we’re that much closer to having our own
thing.</p>
<p><strong>padich</strong>: –I see that, yeah, s’smart move, for us
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>serna</strong>: Trust me, we keep our mouths shut, go about
our thing, play the part, nobody suspects us. The old man’s on the fade
Buzzy, fuck him, y’know? And that hurts, I don’t like saying that, but
hey, our livelihood, our lifeboat, y’get?</p>
<p><strong>padiche</strong>: No question, no, you’re right. We gotta do
what’s good for us now.</p>
<p><strong>serna</strong>: Fuckin’ A, first survive, yes?</p>
<p><strong>padiche</strong>: Y’gotta, y’gotta. But d’ya think they’ll
kick ransom for that little prick, assuming we get to’m.</p>
<p><strong>serna</strong>: Yeah, y’ain’t heard the punchline, yet and
before I get to it, one more thing I heard, little curious, should
probably bring it up…Primo wants Israel’s heart. The actual thing, the
organ.</p>
<p><strong>padiche</strong>: …Jesus…what for?</p>
<p><strong>serna</strong>: –who can say. He’s off his onion, y’know,
he’s old school Sicilian, this is how they hate.</p>
<p><strong>padiche</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p><strong>serna</strong>: Hey, we nab Israel, they pay t’get’m back,
I’ll cut the fuckin’ thing out m’self, no extra charge. My thing is, we
crew up, let’s not fuck around, someone’s cousin, some Zip off the boat
from Naples, let’s get pros, people who know how to behave.</p>
<p><strong>padiche</strong>: Yeah, there’s a pair’a broads I’m thinking
might be good for this.</p>
<p><strong>serna</strong>: Chances are, they’re gonna get into some shit
too, hafta put people down.</p>
<p><strong>padiche</strong>: That’s not a problem. Are we goin’ outta
pocket ourselves?</p>
<p><strong>serna</strong>: Yeah, I can front this.</p>
<p><strong>padiche</strong>: Well just so I got a quote in my head.
What’s the rate for the Swede?</p>
<p><strong>serna</strong>: That’s the punchline, y’ready?</p>
<p><strong>padiche</strong>: Shoot.</p>
<p><strong>serna</strong>: A million flat.</p>
<p><strong>padiche</strong>: No shit.</p>
<p><strong>serna</strong>: None whatsoever.</p>
<p><strong>dupree</strong>: Buddy Israel, nicknamed “Aces” Born a
bastard, mom Laverne chased the pipe dream from a Dairy Queen in Kansas
City to the Vegas stage. Two months after stepping off a Greyhound, she
gets knocked up by some hood.</p>
<p><strong>dupree</strong>: Biological abandons her and the showgirl
thing goes sideways so she winds up working as a magician’s assistant to
make extra cash.</p>
<p><strong>dupree</strong>: …And young Buddy learns everything about
cards from this Mandrake motherfucker his mom is working for…</p>
<p><strong>dupree</strong>: But magic man was also a degenerate gambler
and got caught dealing bottom- deck at a mob-owned poker parlor. He
didn’t get outta there with much more than a pulse.</p>
<p><strong>dupree</strong>: Point is, he passed on all this slight of
hand shit onto Aces and the kid is sick with it…By the age of twelve
Buddy Israel is positively prodigal with a deck of cards. By sixteen,
he’s headlining the MGM’s main room.</p>
<p><strong>dupree</strong>: This punk is pulling down ten bills a night
and more showgirl geech than you can shake a stick at. Four years of
sold-out shows, he becomes the unofficial mob mascot</p>
<p><strong>dupree</strong>: …Wiseguys start to think this sonofabitch is
a mystic, something special…and Aces plays it up, lets the legend grow,
takes time off from his stage act and starts showcasing the chip on his
shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>dupree</strong>: He buys into his bullshit, building street
cred, he’s got plans and pull, he’s makin’ plays, living the mob life
for real. Somehow, it takes: Lounge act turned legitimate thug.</p>
<p><strong>dupree</strong>: In reality, he doesn’t know the ball from
the bounce…He’s not a crook, so he starts fucking up fast and picking up
speed, putting a floodlight on the whole Carlotta organization. Cops get
curious, start camping out, compiling names and faces and pretty soon
Israel’s bullshit has brought the heat to bear on none other than Primo
Sparraza–</p>
<p><strong>locke</strong>: –Enforcer. Extortionist. Killer.</p>
<p><strong>locke</strong>: Sparazza is rumored to have performed in
excess of one-hundred and thirty contract murders, including one of the
bureau’s most celebrated agents. Freeman Heller. You heard of “The
Turnpike Murders” that was Sparazza.</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: I thought Heller was a double op?</p>
<p><strong>locke</strong>: No. He worked for the O.S.S. before joining
the Bureau in its heyday. He was the first operative assigned with
infiltrating the mob.</p>
<p><strong>locke</strong>: Full immersion and assimilation, fake
identity, falsified background, everything that is now standard
operating procedure, Heller implemented, way back when.</p>
<p><strong>locke</strong>: And as a result, his undercover work was
wildly successful. He eventually reached the rank of Capo inside the
Carlotta crime family…but through some internal slip-up, his cover was
compromised and Primo Sparazza was given the contract to kill him.</p>
<p><strong>locke</strong>: There wasn’t enough evidence to bring formal
charges, so the case never went to trial.</p>
<p><strong>locke</strong>: Sparazza is a bit of a specter. Over the
years, the serious crimes with which he was thought to be involved,
including Heller’s murder, could never be traced back to him.</p>
<p><strong>locke</strong>: A dedicated viciousness and a slavish
devotion to mob doctrine had Sparazza’s star on the rise. So the mob
relocated him to Nevada and he became the unofficial head of the Las
Vegas LCN.</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: So he’s personally issued the contract on
Israel?</p>
<p><strong>locke</strong>: Sparazza was the one who introduced Israel to
the life, gave him his first big break, brought him through the
ranks.</p>
<p><strong>carruthers</strong>: Made him a friend of the family.</p>
<p><strong>locke</strong>: …His hand-picked protege, successor to the
throne…and Israel played the situation very shrewd.</p>
<p><strong>locke</strong>: …Slowly amassing the loyalties of Sparazza’s
top men…with plans of toppling the throne.</p>
<p><strong>locke</strong>: In doing so, he plunged the Carlotta
organization into a civil war, splitting the family into dual factions.
Sparazza on one side, Israel on the other. The infighting that followed
drew the interest of nearly every major investigative body operating
under the canopy of the federal government.</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: A marked man gets wise and wants to come
in.</p>
<p><strong>locke</strong>: His testimony has the potential of blowing
the lid off what’s left of the La Cosa Nostra is this country. That
alone warrants total immunity from prosecution and and a vanishing act
with Witness Protection.</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: So the wiretaps we conducted on Serna and
Padiche, the mention of Israel’s heart?</p>
<p><strong>locke</strong>: –Your intel corroborates what we already
know. Sparazza’s health is in rapid decline and before his date with
destiny, it seems he wants one last thing…The heart of his sworn enemy.
A recently opened, cash rich escrow account has been traced back to
Sparazza. This and the mention of this mysterious Swede makes the
million dollar contract on Israel very real.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: How real…?</p>
<p><strong>wyman</strong>: How ’bout six-figures for this fool? How
’bout that love?</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Bulllllshit…</p>
<p><strong>wyman</strong>: Naw baby, they heard about that Triad hit,
the work ya’ll put in and they recognize the skills. And this ain’t no
tryout, tap-dance “show us your shit” thing neither– if ya’ll want this
then I’mma go git it for ’ya.</p>
<p><strong>watters</strong>: So me and Sis here, ’cuz we got a rep on a
rise, we chipped some nails on some niggas, they want us to drop this
mafiaoso so and so, magician, whatever-the fuck he is.</p>
<p><strong>wyman</strong>: S’way it works girl. Ya’ll done dirt, ya’ll
peeled some serious caps. Word travels.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: And so I get this straight, we gotta go in,
bust on this punk and remove the heart? Is that for real?</p>
<p><strong>wyman</strong>: No, no, no, y’gotta go in and get him, pull’m
out of wherever he at, forget all that other shit, that’s just f’flavor.
I’m still getting lil’ bits’a this-n-that from this cat Padiche, the man
contacting me…Right now, what we got– –Is a number and a name…Buddy
Israel.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: What else did Padiche say?</p>
<p><strong>wyman</strong>: He said that the shit could get hot, could
get heavy…I said good. ’Cuz I got two of the hottest, heaviest bitches
alive.</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: Like who?</p>
<p><strong>locke</strong>: Like Pasquale Acosta, blood money mercenary.
His countrymen have dubbed him the more dubious “El Estrago” The
Plague.</p>
<p><strong>locke</strong>: American educated, fluent in over a dozen
languages, did journeyman’s work for CIA funded “G-2” and “Archivo”
death squads in Guatemala and Chile…noted for his legendary torture
techniques.</p>
<p><strong>flash to</strong>: Acosta scorching an off-camera scrotum
with a blowtorch. FLASH TO: Acosta powering up a bore-drill as a
semi-nude man screams and pleads.</p>
<p><strong>locke</strong>: Sought for war crimes and human rights
violations in eighteen different countries. When he was caught by the
SAS in Northern Ireland and imprisoned, he chewed off his fingertips to
the bone before he could be printed and ID’d by Interpol.</p>
<p><strong>locke</strong>: On an extradition flight back to El Salvador,
he murdered a security detachment and vanished.</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: You think it’s possible he could be
involved in the Israel hit?</p>
<p><strong>locke</strong>: Possibly. Acosta is pure mercenary. And a
million dollar hit fee will draw some huge flies. But forget about
Sparazza’s money for a moment and remember, there’s no shortage of those
who want Israel killed and no shortage of cash to do just that…</p>
<p><strong>dupree</strong>: …Then I’m sure you’ve heard of these
guys…The Tremor brothers.</p>
<p><strong>dupree</strong>: No? Then you’ve both been living under the
same rock, ’cuz these cocksuckers are infamous. Three brothers, same
skank mom, different deadbeat dads, used for that suicide-kamikaze style
shit. You heard about that huge shoot- out in Cleveland?</p>
<p><strong>deeks</strong>: Is that the club that got wiped out a couple
months back?</p>
<p><strong>elmore</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>dupree</strong>: The Teamsters had a reform measure going to
ballot that didn’t sit too well with the local syndicate. Night of the
polling, big black-tie to-do downtown and the Tremor Brothers crash the
party. Literally.</p>
<p><strong>dupree</strong>: Donald McGarey, the local union rep, is the
mark. The Tremors go ripshit riot on the whole club, seven people dead,
twenty-eight wounded. Just to get to this one guy.</p>
<p><strong>dupree</strong>: –And they get it about as good as they give
it. In the melee, one of the brothers catches blowback from a jammed
piece and is temporarily blinded, the other takes bullets to the lower
back and can’t walk. The third gets popped in the neck and passes out.
McGarey gets out of the club alive…and not much further…</p>
<p><strong>dupree</strong>: They’re speed freaks, neo-nazi’s. Sworn to
the swastika, supposedly read and recite “Mein Kampf” like Mother
Goose…And these motherfuckers can go megaton at the drop of a hat.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: What’s the name again?</p>
<p><strong>wyman</strong>: “Soot, Lazlo Soot.” Lotta folks want this
white boy clapped. Soot could be workin’ for one ’em.</p>
<p><strong>wyman</strong>: Nobody really certain where he come from…</p>
<p><strong>wyman</strong>: …and when he moves on somebody, they the last
ones t’see it comin’–</p>
<p><strong>dupree</strong>: So what do you think?</p>
<p><strong>elmore</strong>: I think it’s idiotic to continue this
conversation. We’re ex-cops which means we weren’t great cops or even
good ones.</p>
<p><strong>deeks</strong>: Paying bills with bullshit casino jobs,
sitting watch on slot machines.</p>
<p><strong>elmore</strong>: Which was a great gig until we we walked in
here and started drinking.</p>
<p><strong>dupree</strong>: The bond on Israel expires in eighteen
hours, after that, it’s a jump ball. Our window is now.</p>
<p><strong>deeks</strong>: Who posted his bail?</p>
<p><strong>dupree</strong>: His law firm, same one that hired me. Israel
walked out after he made bail and nobody’s seen him since.</p>
<p><strong>elmore</strong>: Jack, if the rumors hold and Israel is
really the great white whale of snitches, then the mob is looking to put
all kinds of bullets into his ass and pour some serious psychotics into
the mix to do just that. So what real incentive is there to track him on
something as small-time as a skip trace, when it’s putting you and yours
in the path of severe pain and suffering and an almost certain prelude
to doom.</p>
<p><strong>dupree</strong>: So I guess you’re not going.</p>
<p><strong>elmore</strong>: Shit, if you’re on a crazy jag, why stop
there, why not take Fort Knox with a fucking slingshot or go into Hell
after Hitler…I like your chances a lot more.</p>
<p><strong>dupree</strong>: I know his location, we’ve got the drop of a
maybe half a day before that location gets grape-vined and the rest of
the world gets hipped.</p>
<p><strong>elmore</strong>: That’s already happened hoss. It’s naive to
think otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>deeks</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>wyman</strong>: –Lake Tahoe.</p>
<p><strong>watters</strong>: Three hours t’the east. S’day trip. Pretty
this time a’year too…</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: We gotta lay something out, strategy- wise.
Somethin’ tight. Y’go in there ad-libbing, it’s y’ass.</p>
<p><strong>watters</strong>: What are we talkin’ on the split…</p>
<p><strong>wyman</strong>: Forty-five apiece for you two, ten percent
finders fee for me.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: What’s the time frame?</p>
<p><strong>wyman</strong>: Right mafuck’n now girl. Fast as we can get
you there. We wait any longer, someone goin’ dead this fool.</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: …Then we lose our witness.</p>
<p><strong>locke</strong>: We lose our case. Twenty-four hours from now,
he’s scheduled to meet with federal prosecutors. His agent, a man by the
name of Morris Mecklen, has guaranteed us that he’ll enter into
protective custody once his deal is approved.</p>
<p><strong>locke</strong>: We’ve been monitoring Mecklen’s calls and
have learned that Israel is staying in the penthouse level of the Nomad
Hotel and Casino in Lake Tahoe, Nevada under an assumed name.</p>
<p><strong>carruthers</strong>: Right there? In the high-roller
suite?</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: It’s the last place they’d look.</p>
<p><strong>locke</strong>: Israel’s legal representation, the firm of
Culpepper, Brody and Reed, which is currently the subject of a joint SEC
and Treasury Department probe, were left holding the bag after he
skipped bail. Over three- quarters of a million dollars on a bond that’s
set to expire in less than a day. Rupert Reed, one of the firm’s
partners, has learned of Israel’s whereabouts and dispatched a local
bondsman by the name of Jack Dupree to pick him up and return him to Las
Vegas…that can’t happen. We have a Gulf Stream standing by at Reagan
International to transport you two to Lake Tahoe. It’s very simple
gentlemen. Valacchi, Fratiano, Gravano– no former witness against the
mob has been as crucial or has brought more to bear on the potential
dissolution of The La Cosa Nostra, than Buddy Israel.</p>
<p><strong>locke</strong>: …But understand that if an attempt is made on
his life…</p>
<p><strong>locke</strong>: …then it is being made by those of the
strictest professional caliber…</p>
<p><strong>locke</strong>: …They are cold-blooded, ruthless, and without
restraint…and they must not succeed.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: …he’s here now…</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: D’you talk to’m?</p>
<p><strong>hugo</strong>: I got his machine.</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: What’d you say?</p>
<p><strong>hugo</strong>: I said I got his machine.</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: No, what did you say on the machine?</p>
<p><strong>hugo</strong>: I left him a message.</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: I know you left him a message. What did you
say!</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: Jesus Hugo!</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: How is it that you can turn a simple
conversation into a fucking hedge maze!? This is zero degree of
difficulty man!</p>
<p><strong>hugo</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: Then why are you still looking at me like
I’m asking for the square root of something! What did you say!?</p>
<p><strong>hugo</strong>: I said that we were returning his call and you
were real concerned, because he sounded real concerned.</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: Look at that, we didn’t have to fill up the
whole blackboard after all. Now, do you know anything about that?</p>
<p><strong>hugo</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: Look at the collar on that coat…</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: What’s that look like, that stain?</p>
<p><strong>hugo</strong>: I dunno…Cinnamon roll?</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: Cinnamon roll? No, good guess though. No,
Hugo that looks like jizz… And I’m no forensic expert mind you, but that
looks like some fuckhead shot their load on a twelve-thousand dollar
calf’s skin jacket. The twist? It’s My twelve thousand dollar, calf’s
skin jacket. So y’got semen, human ejaculate–</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: –that’s been allowed to soak in for what,
six, seven hours now? Work it’s way into the fabric-fuck’n fibers– and
while you may never see it in a Tide commercial, I think it still safely
qualifies as a “tough, deep down stain.”</p>
<p><strong>hugo</strong>: I could have it sent out…</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: …to what? Incinerate? ’Cuz I’m almost dead
certain there’s not a fucking laundry detergent or dry cleaning process
known to man that can ever return that jacket to its former glory! Some
shit, suffice it to say, just don’t wash out. Now, the money question…To
whom does that stain belong?</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: C’mon, somebody was banging one of these
skanks, sans rubber– -which is terrifying in its own right- pulled out,
let ’er rip and ruined the last gift my mother gave me before she died.
The way I see it, it’s the same as if she was dug up, three months dead
and it was shot right on her rotting corpse, ’cuz that’s how it defiled
this feels!</p>
<p><strong>hugo</strong>: Do you want me to say I did it?</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: I was kinda hoping, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>hugo</strong>: Do you want me to say I’m sorry?</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: Only if you really, truly mean it.</p>
<p><strong>hugo</strong>: …I’m sorry…</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: Are you a fucking colossal idiot?</p>
<p><strong>hugo</strong>: I am. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: Without peer?</p>
<p><strong>hugo</strong>: I– uh, yeah, I guess, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: No. Be sure. Be resolute. You stand alone on
that summit.</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: Get the phone, it might be Gill, then get
out of my sight.</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: No. The cards can stay there. Get The
Goddamn Phone.</p>
<p><strong>carruthers</strong>: Yes Sir. Go ahead. We’re three miles
from The Nomad now. We’ll be awaiting word.</p>
<p><strong>serna</strong>: –so, I’m thinkin’ we jump, do this in the
next day or so, get to Israel before the Swede can–</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: Anything on the Swede?</p>
<p><strong>carruthers</strong>: Only the mention made in that phone
call. There’s no Swedish hitman of any renown, much less one with a
million dollar day rate.</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: Maybe he’s that good. Never been caught, no
criminal record.</p>
<p><strong>carruthers</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: I tell you, engineering this kind of play
against Sparazza, going to the lengths these guys are going to…they’re
playing some long odds.</p>
<p><strong>carruthers</strong>: And a very bad gamble.</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: Well… This is as good a place for it as any
I guess.</p>
<p><strong>finds</strong>: A slicker older cat in a Guyabera shirt,
mid-fifties, spotted skin, sun damaged, pocked with pre-cancerous black.
We recognize him from the mugshots and surveillance video: It’s VICTOR
PADICHE. Sykes and Watters enter FRAME. Padiche stands, greeting them,
smiling-cigarette-stained-dentures…</p>
<p><strong>padiche</strong>: Girls, wonderful, here, sit.</p>
<p><strong>padiche</strong>: Okay, so…you’re here, really nice isn’t it?
Brisk weather, but nice. Coffee? Anything? I didn’t want to order for
you.</p>
<p><strong>watters</strong>: No, we’re cool.</p>
<p><strong>padiche</strong>: Fabulous. I’m fine sweetheart, thanks.
Okay, so…welcome to the south shore! So, just jumpin’ right in, just in
terms of this thing, our thing. I spoke to Lorenzo this morning, he says
y’got somethin’ more or less put together, plan’a attack and me and my
associate Mr. Serna, who I can put on the phone hear, we’d love t’hear
it.</p>
<p><strong>padiche</strong>: We ain’t askin’ ya t’take us through, soup
t’nuts or ‘nuthin’ like that, I jus’ like t’hear the broad strokes,
y’know, so we can get an idea–</p>
<p><strong>watters</strong>: Pussy.</p>
<p><strong>padiche</strong>: Wha’?</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Pussy.</p>
<p><strong>padiche</strong>: “Pushy?”</p>
<p><strong>watters</strong>: Pussy.</p>
<p><strong>padiche</strong>: –Uh…</p>
<p><strong>watters</strong>: Israel likes pussy…</p>
<p><strong>padiche</strong>: …Oh…uh-huh, yeah–</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: And we like that he likes…</p>
<p><strong>padiche</strong>: …Pussy?</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Correct.</p>
<p><strong>padiche</strong>: …Fabulous.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Yeah, Jack, alright…hey– Nice t’meet you. Rip
Reed.</p>
<p><strong>deeks</strong>: Pete.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Okay, good, good, c’mon, c’min.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Where’s your third? This was a troika, no?</p>
<p><strong>dupree</strong>: He’s…fuckin’…he’s comin’…</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Hey, hey how r’ya, Rip Reed.</p>
<p><strong>elmore</strong>: Hollis. Elmore.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: So Jack tells me you’re both ex-cops?</p>
<p><strong>deeks</strong>: Yeah, that’s right.</p>
<p><strong>dupree</strong>: They worked as swingmen for the Vegas Vice
squad– What? Five, six years?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Man the stories you guys must tell. I grew up
soft myself, private schools, little blazers, you “Talked it out” nobody
threw punches, t’this day, never been hit with a fist, Imagine that,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Pretty much a panty-waste, trembling little
faggot-fairy when I smell trouble– and I don’t say this to be
self-deprecating, I just don’t have much of an opinion about myself, I
mean, shit, I wish I was a lot more like you guys, barfighters, big
swinging dicks, gettin’ it done. Sadly. This is it. It’s…disgusting.
Thanks God, dogpile a piss-poor physique with an small cock and
hereditary alcoholism! ’preciate it! Okay, I’m babbling, I do this when
I drink, forgive the rants, let’s get at it here. This wanted felon
fucking prick bastard Buddy Israel and the nearly one million dollar
bail bond.</p>
<p><strong>dupree</strong>: Rip, my right hand to God, we’re gonna go in
and recover this asshole and everybody’s gonna leave the theater
grinning. Trust me.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: That confidence translates bro, seriously, it
does! Out-STANDING!</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: I’m a lawyer, y’know, I need to hear these
things, little boosts, helps allay my fears, I pass that piece of mind
along to my partners. Alright, so, couple primers for you guys, maybe
things we might’ve looked past that you should know about…His
hangers-on, these idiots Israel runs with, they’re all “packing heat”
“strapped” whatever the phrase is. Point two, Israel likes hookers, so
you might run into a harem up there. Point three: He binges between a
six- to-seven thousand dollar a day cocaine habit that nobody knows
about, so he</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: and those hookers, will most likely be high.
He also drinks, self- medicates, the whole cliche, y’know? The strung
out hasbeen jerkoff snitch drunk. The seven-layer loser. I’m praying he
puts up a fight, please, please, please, rape him if possible,
I’ll-pay-the-extra-whatever–</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Yeah-yeah-yeah. Fucking hell, this feels
GREAT! YEAH!? DOESN’T IT!</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Okay, we had a retainer, for services to be
rendered…Fifty thousand dollars.</p>
<p><strong>sir ivy</strong>: Calm down.</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: Don’t tell me to “calm down” Ivy! I hate
that!</p>
<p><strong>sir ivy</strong>: Look at the attention we’re getting. It’s
all bad…</p>
<p><strong>hugo</strong>: Hey– It’s him, it’s Gill.</p>
<p><strong>sir ivy</strong>: …We got these tricks going in and out,
we’re partying like the shit might go stale, what did you think was
gonna happen?</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: Fifty grand gouge. South shore hayseeds,
this is why I never play Tahoe, or redneck Reno…</p>
<p><strong>sir ivy</strong>: We’re hot, and they’re losing a whole
floor’s worth of business saying it’s “under construction.”</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: Alright, bag it, I’m not shelling out that
kinda bread for this shithole, this is a junior suite in Vegas. Call
Mecklen right now, he should have his cell on, I need an update. Get the
Russian up here, have him clean this place, floor to ceiling and get us
packed . …And send out for some new skeeze, the sun’s up, these ones are
starting to stink…</p>
<p><strong>beanie</strong>: Alright ya’ll, that’s the call, we had our
fun, pack it in, pro-ceed to the front. Les’ go, les’ go–</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: Are you on a land line?</p>
<p><strong>dr. gill</strong>: Yeah, why.</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: Just checking…what’s up? What’s wrong with
your voice?</p>
<p><strong>dr. gill</strong>: I’ve got concerns.</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: …About what?</p>
<p><strong>dr. gill</strong>: About cocaine…and the amount you’re
doing.</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: I’m not doing cocaine.</p>
<p><strong>dr. gill</strong>: Buddy, I’m not an ethics professor, I’m a
physician, be honest, or be dead within a day…s’your choice.</p>
<p><strong>dr. gill</strong>: …I just got the cardiology work-up back
and sent it to two of my colleagues, both heart specialists. They
concluded, as I have, that you are showing signs of severe cardiac
distress…so much so, that a massive coronary may be imminent.</p>
<p><strong>beanie</strong>: Damn girl, look out now!</p>
<p><strong>beanie</strong>: All these good for is poppin’ them titties
girl, but y’see what happens when you try to get around in ’em?</p>
<p><strong>dr. gill</strong>: –Forget about the tissue damage you’re
doing to the heart itself. Sustained cocaine abuse will segue you from a
very painful ventricular fibrillation into full cardiac arrest. Buddy,
nobody knows about your condition, or your drug use. Why you lied to me,
knowing that I’d find out anyway, I’ll never know, but it imperative now
that I see you.</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: That’s not possible. I told you.</p>
<p><strong>dr. gill</strong>: There are certain meds, certain
intravenous measures that can counteract some of the damage you’ve done,
but I’d have to administer them myself.</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: Won’t work, we’re just gonna have to chance
it man. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>dr. gill</strong>: No. Sorry comes later, when you’re in a
partial coma with ambulatory paralysis. Sorry comes when we have to
decide which of your limbs have to be amputated because severely
constricted blood flow has brought about a gangrenous infection,
sorry–</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: –Fine, fuck, I got it…Lake Tahoe, Nevada.
I’ll have Hugo book your flight, you can be here in a couple hours.
He’ll meet you at the airport.</p>
<p><strong>dr. gill</strong>: …He’s in Lake Tahoe.</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: Be cool, be cool, be cool…c’mon…</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: Just this last little bit, then we’re done,
just this tiny bit and that’s it, that’s it, all of it, over–</p>
<p><strong>beanie</strong>: Awwww, motherfuck me! C’mon woman! Hold your
shit! This is silk!</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: …How the mighty have fallen…</p>
<p><strong>carruthers</strong>: He’s awake.</p>
<p><strong>carruthers</strong>: Spotter on the lake confirmed Israel.
Penthouse level. There was apparently a fisticuffs with some
prostitutes. He wasn’t involved. He’s also had his people phone a local
madame for another group of girls.</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: No rest for the wicked. Why were we never
shown these files? We’re sitting on Sparazza for what? Six months now
and we’re just seeing this? Did you know that he’s has had thirty- six
major medical procedures performed on him since 1953? Elective plastic
surgery, every single one–</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: –look at this, look at the work he’s had
done; nose, three times, eyes, eyelids, chin, jaw– he’s had his jaw done
a dozen times.</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: You take every hasbeen actor in Hollywood
they haven’t been cut this much.</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: Unreal, this guys jacket too. Wall- to-wall
major felony offenses, murder, extortion, arson, grand larceny– –A
paternity suit…I just feel like we’re playing catch-up with all this and
we shouldn’t be.</p>
<p><strong>carruthers</strong>: Welcome to the new Bureau. Nobody shares
information anymore, it’s become synonymous with job security.</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: Based on what we had, I thought Sparazza
was a mid-level player at best and it turns out he’s this mob relic,
running the show out west.</p>
<p><strong>carruthers</strong>: He’s stayed below the radar. You don’t
kill a hundred and thirty people without knowing how to tip-toe.</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: But the Bureau knew Sparazza killed Heller.
Why not go after him, guns blazing’ for that one?</p>
<p><strong>carruthers</strong>: Heller was buried in agency lore,
anytime an operative failed or was perceived to have failed, Hoover
blackballed their memory. Look at Ness.</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: Yeah, but the Untouchables took down
Capone. Heller got shot and killed. The bad guys beat him. Worse,
Sparazza walked.</p>
<p><strong>carruthers</strong>: It’s almost five a.m. in D.C. now. Locke
said the lawyers from Justice had been in there since three o’clock
yesterday afternoon. Israel’s manager is acting as his attorney and
that’s what’s holding things up.</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: So he has no idea what’s about to
happen?</p>
<p><strong>carruthers</strong>: No. And I want to be in that room a half
second after Mecklen calls to say the deal’s done. We’ve got a sheriff’s
task force on stand-by.</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: What about the hotel staff obstructing us.
Israel’s obviously paid off the management.</p>
<p><strong>carruthers</strong>: Tampering with a witness extraction of
this magnitude makes everyone indictable at the federal level. Trust me,
we won’t any problems with the hotel staff. You show ’em your ID with
the letters “F.B.I.” in all caps and it’s instant compliance. I’ve seen
in happen a hundred times.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Special Agent Gerald Diego, Federal Bureau of
Investigation, San Francisco Field Office.</p>
<p><strong>pull back to reveal</strong>: Gerald Diego…aka Pasquale
Acosta, aka “El Estrago” the most notorious torture-murder specialist in
the biz in convincing disguise. His suit, mannerisms and speech. Pitch
Perfect…he’s got the fake-Fed bit down cold.</p>
<p><strong>acosta</strong>: We’re conducting a series of impromptu
inspections for the Nevada Gaming</p>
<p><strong>acosta</strong>: Commission. I’d like to speak with your head
of security.</p>
<p><strong>deeks</strong>: Where’d you get these?</p>
<p><strong>dupree</strong>: Same place that rents the guard’s uniforms.
There’s a shift change at 9am. Graveyard goes home and we can blend in
with the day shift coming on.</p>
<p><strong>deeks</strong>: What about access cards? Pass keys?</p>
<p><strong>dupree</strong>: We’ll have to get our hands on them. There’s
two separate units; Casino Floor/Count Room Security and General Hotel
Security– Does he want to hear this or what?</p>
<p><strong>deeks</strong>: Hollis!</p>
<p><strong>dupree</strong>: Nobody put a gun to your head.</p>
<p><strong>elmore</strong>: Yeah, we’ve been through that.</p>
<p><strong>dupree</strong>: Then quit acting like somebody shit in your
cereal bowl. Reed just gave us fifty grand.</p>
<p><strong>elmore</strong>: –Jack, what am I doing? I’m standing here,
aren’t I? Shouldn’t that be enough? That I made the trip?</p>
<p><strong>dupree</strong>: Your attitude sucks.</p>
<p><strong>elmore</strong>: I been accused of worse. What do we
got…?</p>
<p><strong>dupree</strong>: Two security levels, the one we’re going in
under the guise of, hotel security, has restricted access. They’re
mostly there to monitor the lobby, handle disturbances on the different
floors and toss out drunks. There’s a thirty-five member employee
rotation going from graveyard to day shift. If we split up, we can blend
in and enter unnoticed. Once we’re inside the hotel, we’ll regroup.</p>
<p><strong>elmore</strong>: Then what–</p>
<p><strong>jeeves tremor</strong>: Luvin’ that, rat-tat-tat-tat, clean
as a nun’s snatch on Kristal Nacht!</p>
<p><strong>lester tremor</strong>: Shut up fuckass, them spirits ain’t
vacated yet, s’keep quiet.</p>
<p><strong>jeeves tremor</strong>: Them spirts can kiss my Chinese
ass.</p>
<p><strong>dupree</strong>: …I forgive you Darwin.</p>
<p><strong>darwin tremor</strong>: Shoot, I appreciate that man.</p>
<p><strong>dupree</strong>: If I needed your I.D. and your car and me
and my brothers were wanted by the law, I woulda killed you to get ’em
too.</p>
<p><strong>darwin tremor</strong>: You woulda?</p>
<p><strong>dupree</strong>: Oh hell yeah. We’s just in the wrong place
at the wrong time. So don’t feel so bad dude.</p>
<p><strong>darwin tremor</strong>: Damn…alright then.</p>
<p><strong>dupree</strong>: I don’t mind now anyway.</p>
<p><strong>dupree</strong>: You know, up here in Heaven, it’s beautiful.
Way better than fuckin’ Hawaii or any place like that.</p>
<p><strong>darwin tremor</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>dupree</strong>: I’m glad I’m here. I love it. I’m gonna get
laid by some fine ass angels and then go hang out with Jesus and
them.</p>
<p><strong>darwin tremor</strong>: Man, that’s great.</p>
<p><strong>dupree</strong>: I got it made in the shade Amigo. Hey, I’ll
see you up here some day, don’t worry.</p>
<p><strong>darwin tremor</strong>: You think so?</p>
<p><strong>dupree</strong>: I know so.</p>
<p><strong>darwin tremor</strong>: Damn Jack…you was after the same
sacka shit as us…Small world.</p>
<p><strong>dupree</strong>: Don’t tell your asshole brothers you know
about it, that money is for you old boy.</p>
<p><strong>darwin tremor</strong>: I appreciate that pard…I wish I
coulda been a better friend.</p>
<p><strong>darwin tremor</strong>: Alright enough grabassin’ goddamit!
We need t’get over t’that hotel.</p>
<p><strong>watters</strong>: We’re already here baby.</p>
<p><strong>wyman</strong>: So everything’s cool then?</p>
<p><strong>watters</strong>: We sat down with Padiche, he tried to get
some details which we wasn’t gonna give up, but it’s all good. We goin’
check Sis in first, ’fore I check in across the street.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Will you be needing a room with two double
beds?</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: No, we’re not together.</p>
<p><strong>watters</strong>: C’mon baby, don’t be shy.</p>
<p><strong>watters</strong>: Just one bed please. Although if we sweat
that one up, we goin’ need some clean sheets. C’mon Girl, you know I’m
playing!</p>
<p><strong>watters</strong>: ..If ya’ll let hoochie like that stay up in
here, ya’ll must be burning sheets by the ton.</p>
<p><strong>watters</strong>: You just goin’ grin? Y’ain’t goin comment
on that, at all? Trampy ass skeezers, doin’ damage they ain’t even smart
enough to see. That don’t gall you at all? Bitches like those are the
same ones runnin’ feminism right to the brink girl. Bitches like that
the reason mafuckas don’t take our species seriously. We jus’ meat for
male consumption, we jus’ pieces a’ass and pussy, somethin’ pretty in
lipstick and eye liner can suck cock.</p>
<p><strong>watters</strong>: Bitches like that make me weep for what
could be– if we could all, sisters everywhere, black, white, yellow and
brown, put our shit down one time, unified front, the force of the
female race, mobilized, moving as one…</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: I’m gonna need a mini-bar key too.</p>
<p><strong>lazlo soot</strong>: world class assassin slash master of
disguise. The slowly developing polaroid depicts the same face that we
now see in the mirror. Soot touches up the putty and plastic appliances
on his face, smoothing, sealing…</p>
<p><strong>lazlo soot</strong>: –Keep calm.</p>
<p><strong>dead man</strong>: I am an employee, I– I don’t know wh– they
don’t let me speak to h–</p>
<p><strong>lazlo soot</strong>: –Say your name. Then say “How can I be
of assistance.”</p>
<p><strong>dead man</strong>: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>lazlo soot</strong>: I didn’t ask for your understanding. I
asked you to say your name, followed by the phrase “How can I be of
assistance.”</p>
<p><strong>lazlo soot</strong>: Last chance.</p>
<p><strong>dead man</strong>: My name is Vitoli. How can I be of
assistance.</p>
<p><strong>lazlo soot</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>soot</strong>: My name is Vitoli. How can I be of
assistance.</p>
<p><strong>soot</strong>: This is Vitoli. How can I be of
assistance.</p>
<p><strong>hugo</strong>: Answer your fucking pages! I’ve been calling
for fifteen minutes, we need you up here to clean NOW!</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: That’s right! RIGHT NOW!</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: They’re gonna give on this in the next ten
seconds or the deal’s off!</p>
<p><strong>mecklen</strong>: I dunno what to say to you sweetheart, it
is what it is.</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: Bullshit it is. I said, about as loud as I
could say it, “no jail time for my guys.”</p>
<p><strong>mecklen</strong>: And they’re not going give there pally.
They’re bricking us on that particular issue.</p>
<p><strong>mecklen</strong>: Baby, I’ve been co-habitating with these
people for the past thirty odd hours and in so doing, have stared into
the face of hell. These are the premier prick cocksuckers of all time
and I feel beaten by them, I feel bloodied–</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: –and you’re gonna feel altogether fucked, by
me, if you don’t handle this. I’m the one, does the face plant, this
falls apart, not you.</p>
<p><strong>mecklen</strong>: And I vibe that kiddo, I do indeed, but
it’s one’a those fait accompli things, you have to–</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: I don’t have to do shit! Which includes
cooperating any further with these motherfuckers until I get what I
want!</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: Alright, fuck it, if we gotta hand ’em
somebody from our end and they’re being hard-ons about it– make it Hugo,
him I don’t mind. He needs that regimented thing that prison
provides–</p>
<p><strong>mecklen</strong>: –Buddy, it’s bigger than that, they want
’em all, Ivy, Beanie–</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: –this isn’t a swap meet Morrey, they’re
getting Sparazza and the west coast syndicate, giftwrapped, now if
that’s not good enough–</p>
<p><strong>mecklen</strong>: –Listen kid, let’s not antagonize this any
more. I got ’em backed down on the book and t.v. deals. They’re agreeing
to give you all the after tax profits, so you can come away with some
chits and live comfortably. If we push this, they’ll revoke your
protective status, which nullifies any agreement you got with the
government…Now that’s mate and checkmate kiddo and once that happens,
the shit’ll start falling down around your ears, real fast.</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: Alright…do it.</p>
<p><strong>carruthers</strong>: Israel just rolled.</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: He’s giving them up?</p>
<p><strong>carruthers</strong>: All of ’em. His entire entourage. I
think we should move.</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: Did the Justice lawyers sign off?</p>
<p><strong>carruthers</strong>: That’s happening in about ten minutes.
Israel’s at optimum risk of flight right now, so we can’t wait.</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: What about the sheriff’s task force?</p>
<p><strong>carruthers</strong>: Have them mobilized. I’ll phone security
and have the elevators locked down and stairwells secured. We need to
keep Israel sequestered in that penthouse.</p>
<p><strong>security supervisor</strong>: No, I’m sorry, the penthouse is
currently under construction.</p>
<p><strong>acosta</strong>: Can I speak to you privately?</p>
<p><strong>security supervisor</strong>: Gary, let’s get our personnel
up in the catwalk over twelve, that stickman has been acting odd and I
don’t like the rolls that table has been getting.</p>
<p><strong>employee</strong>: Got it.</p>
<p><strong>acosta</strong>: It’s gotta be tough keeping an eye on
everything.</p>
<p><strong>security supervisor</strong>: And everybody, all the time.
Yeah, it’s a chore.</p>
<p><strong>acosta</strong>: So, Bill, if I understand this right, you
currently have your penthouse floor under construction?</p>
<p><strong>security supervisor</strong>: That’s correct.</p>
<p><strong>acosta</strong>: But with these down, doesn’t that pose a
major security concern if, as you say, you have to keep an eye on
everything at all times?</p>
<p><strong>security supervisor</strong>: Well, we were worried about
dust and debris from the work being done ruining the cameras, so–</p>
<p><strong>acosta</strong>: –so you shut them off?</p>
<p><strong>security supervisor</strong>: Yes, but no– we have personnel
stationed at both ends of that hall, twenty-four hours a day.</p>
<p><strong>acosta</strong>: What kind of personnel?</p>
<p><strong>security supervisor</strong>: Right now? A six man security
force, plus a member of our Butler staff. So seven men total.</p>
<p><strong>acosta</strong>: You have a butler working that floor?</p>
<p><strong>security supervisor</strong>: Uh– well, yes, uh just in terms
of the men up there now, my team, he’s serving lunch and dinner and just
doing general upkeep so–</p>
<p><strong>acosta</strong>: So there are no guests staying on that
floor?</p>
<p><strong>security supervisor</strong>: No. None at present.</p>
<p><strong>acosta</strong>: C’mon Bill…you’ve got some Sultan up there,
one of your whales, big- spender, likes a lot of space, you cook up this
“construction” thing…?</p>
<p><strong>security supervisor</strong>: No, no, no. We’ve been looking
to renovate that area of our hotel for some time now. The security team
is only present to preserve floor integrity, due to the roof access.</p>
<p><strong>acosta</strong>: Is your security team armed?</p>
<p><strong>security supervisor</strong>: Of course. Yes.</p>
<p><strong>acosta</strong>: And who has access to that floor?</p>
<p><strong>acosta</strong>: Bill, listen, I can ask you now and you can
answer me, or I can drag you up to San Francisco and depose you in front
of a federal judge. Because that’s where we’re headed here.</p>
<p><strong>security supervisor</strong>: I’m sorry, but I’m going to
need to see your identification again. We’re covering some sensitive
material here and I need to safeguard myself, I’m sure you can
understand.</p>
<p><strong>acosta</strong>: Of course, but if you could just tell me who
has access to that floor–</p>
<p><strong>security supervisor</strong>: –I hold the sole pass key and
personally relieve the shifts myself. Now if I could get your ID we
can–</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Hello? This is Special Agent Donald
Carruthers of the FBI, I need an–</p>
<p><strong>security supervisor</strong>: Is…that…blood?</p>
<p><strong>acosta</strong>: Yes it is and right now it’s filling your
lungs. In less than a minute, you’ll asphyxiate and pass out. You
shouldn’t be feeling any pain now.</p>
<p><strong>acosta</strong>: Close your eyes. Think of something
wonderful. Don’t make this face the last thing you ever see. Heaven may
hold it against you.</p>
<p><strong>security supervisor</strong>: …Am I really dying…?</p>
<p><strong>acosta</strong>: Bill– Willliam… We’re all dying…</p>
<p><strong>…we see on-screen</strong>: The Employee entrance, grave and
swing shifts on their way out, day shift on it’s way in. Mixed in with
this personnel rotation, each doing his inconspicuous best…The Brothers
Tremor.</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: Double homicide, gunshot vics, both of ’em
dumped in the lake. That’s where the Sheriff’s task force is.</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: Deputy, have you made any ID’s?</p>
<p><strong>carruthers</strong>: Get a coroner’s estimate too. –Miss,
I’ve been transferred and I was disconnected. No one is answering and I
need someone from security to pick up that line. It’s urgent.</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: Dep– Deputy, I’m going to put you on
speaker, I have Agent Carruthers in the car with me. You need to hear

<p><strong>sheriff deputy</strong>: –nd have a pending ID on a Jack
Dupree, appears to be a bondsman out of Las Vegas. He was just rolled

<p><strong>carruthers</strong>: Was there anything recovered?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff deputy</strong>: We found a handwritten receipt in
his pocket for what looks like uniform rentals. The name and phone
number of the rental house wasn’t listed,</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: What kind of uniforms?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff deputy</strong>: Receipt wasn’t specific, the
uniforms were just listed as maroon in color.</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: Alright, deputy, we’ll be there as soon as
possible, until we arrive, I need you to limit physical access and
restrict movement to and from the crime scene. Clear?</p>
<p><strong>carruthers</strong>: Maroon uniforms?</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: Yeah. Have you been able to get through to
the Nomad’s security?</p>
<p><strong>carruthers</strong>: No. I’m going over there. You take the
car from there, get out to the lake.</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: You going up to the Penthouse alone?</p>
<p><strong>carruthers</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: That’s a bad move.</p>
<p><strong>watters</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: ’Cuz we don’t need to draw any more shit down
on our heads. We hit whoever’s between us and Israel. I don’t want to
dead the whole floor and I don’t want to be killing women no matter how

<p><strong>watters</strong>: What!?</p>

<p><strong>sykes</strong>: –I don’t know, I feel like you always pushin’
up on me, gettin’ close and I love you baby, in every way you can love a

<p><strong>watters</strong>: I ain’t even goin’ dignify that. You my

<p><strong>padiche</strong>: Lil’ cagey, y’know, don’t like t’share
trade secrets, that type’a thing.</p>
<p><strong>serna</strong>: Okay– yeah, I can, I respect that.</p>

this– mean exactly? …What? …Good God… ..Good God… No, the two of them
attached, Agent’s Carruthers and Messner. I’d like to notify them
immedia–</p>
<p><strong>locke</strong>: Understood Sir…They won’t be contacted…I’m

<p><strong>dr. gill</strong>: I’m here, where’s the car?</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: I sent Hugo, he should be there!</p>
<p><strong>dr. gill</strong>: Well I don’t see him.</p>
<p><strong>gill</strong>: Should I take a taxi or what?</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: No, wait there. He’ll be there.</p>

<p><strong>israel</strong>: IVY! Why isn’t Hugo at the airport!? It’s a
fifteen minute trip!</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: Well what the fuck!? I got the Doc in town,
I need him here! Call Hugo, find out where the car is!</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: So what’d Mecklen have to say?</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: They’re getting close. It’s down to a
handful of deal points now.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: But it’s all good right?</p>
<p><strong>sir ivy</strong>: So we’re all traveling together, getting
sworn, giving our statements–</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: –I dunno the way it’s gonna play out, but–
yeah, it’ll probably go something like that.</p>
<p><strong>sir ivy</strong>: You believe in loyalty, don’tcha?
’Specially the kind of loyalty where an otherwise sensible motherfucker
puts his own best interests aside to selflessly serve another. ’Cuz
outside a goddamn dog, that kinda loyalty, my kinda shit, don’t get any
more dedicated, or deep, or devout…</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: …what are you tryin’ to say?</p>
<p><strong>carruthers</strong>: What I’ve been saying. Get me your head
of security right now.</p>
<p><strong>casino employee</strong>: –I don’t– it’s just– I can’t reach
him. He’s not picking up the extensio–</p>
<p><strong>carruthers</strong>: –I know that. Which floor are they
on?</p>
<p><strong>casino employee</strong>: Wait– He– there, that’s one of our
guys ther–</p>
<p><strong>carruthers</strong>: Excuse me, sir.</p>
<p><strong>bill/acosta</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>carruthers</strong>: Special Agent Donald Carruthers. We’ve
got a situation developing here in your hotel.</p>
<p><strong>bill/acosta</strong>: How can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>carruthers</strong>: I need to get to your penthouse level
immediately, I also need every other elevator with access to that floor
evacuated and locked down.</p>
<p><strong>bill/acosta</strong>: Is this an emergency?</p>
<p><strong>carruthers</strong>: Let’s hope not.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: I’m going down.</p>
<p><strong>darwin tremor</strong>: Bet’chu are.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: …Faggot-ass redneck…</p>
<p><strong>watters</strong>: What’d you say?</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Not you. Some assholes on the elevator…are
these bitches on a permanent smoke break or what? Why the fuck they
call’m “working girls.”</p>
<p><strong>watters</strong>: Alright, the ho train is exiting the
station. They’re coming to you…</p>
<p><strong>elmore</strong>: Hel– I– ambula– pleeeeee–</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: No, no clarify. What is “an emergency
requisition of surrounding personnel?” Within one-hundred mile radius,
understood– Sacramento, Reno, Carson City. So in less than an hour,
we’re going to have anywhere from forty to fifty odd field agents
arriving, without the slightest inkling as to why they’re here. Is that
correct? Am I misinterpreting that or– No, I’m not blaming any one
person, this is Bureau directive. But Agent Carruthers is the SAC and
he’s out of cell range at the moment, so I can’t contact him to– Very
well. I need to get Deputy Director Locke on the phone as soon as
possible.</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: Who’s this?</p>
<p><strong>cs team member</strong>: Hollis Elmore, resident of Las
Vegas, formerly with the P.D. there. He’s a known associate of
Dupree’s.</p>
<p><strong>cs team member</strong>: We found these washed up on
shore.</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: What are these?</p>
<p><strong>cs team member</strong>: Elmore’s fingers. Whorls are in bad
shape from the frostbite, but we got a good pull for latents,
positive</p>
<p><strong>id.</strong>: Those were shot off.</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: Then we’ve got a third man missing.</p>
<p><strong>task force chief</strong>: We’ve recovered their car.</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: What car?</p>
<p><strong>task force chief</strong>: Dupree’s rental. A Dodge Stratus–
Picked up yesterday at a commuter airport in Reno, Nevada.</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: –Where’s it at now?</p>
<p><strong>task force chief</strong>: In the parking structure of the
Nomad.</p>
<p><strong>hugo</strong>: Doc, I’m gonna tell ’em we’re on our way up,
make sure it’s cool up there. Is there anything you need?</p>
<p><strong>dr. gill</strong>: I’m going up now, give me ten minutes,
that should be enough time to prep…</p>
<p><strong>hugo</strong>: C’mon, somebody answer…</p>
<p><strong>beanie</strong>: That’s a silk blend B, six-hundred and
change an s’got vomit and bile and stomach contents all over it– I ain’t
gonna tell’ya how t’get the mafucka clean, jus’ put it right.</p>
<p><strong>beanie</strong>: Check the man’s calf-skin coat too, he look
like he got some cinnamon roll an’ shit all over it–</p>
<p><strong>beanie</strong>: What the fuck!?</p>
<p><strong>beanie</strong>: Aw hell no you ain’t just do that…</p>
<p><strong>sir ivy</strong>: What did you say to Mecklen?</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: That’s probably him now…</p>
<p><strong>sir ivy</strong>: …See, this is one’a them rare moments when
y’ass get a chance to be completely honest…and if I’m asking you what
you said to Mecklen, assume the shit is rhetorical…so assume I already
know.</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: A set of skills, God-given gifts, I close my
eyes.</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: King of Clubs…You pick up this deck, s’just
playing cards, I pick up this deck it’s a living, breathing thing. What
do you see right now? You see exactly and only, what I choose to show
you….That’s illusion Ivy. That’s the lie I tell your eyes. The
manipulation of movement. Knowing where your gaze wants to go, guiding
it there. Making the magic happen in that moment, that split- second,
but seeing behind it, knowing it’s all bullshit…Built on sand.</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: I can show the Feds what they want to see
too. And make it as real as this room. Make it more than smoke, more
than mirrors…and that’s why I’m valuable…and that’s why you’re not. I
never wanted it this way.</p>
<p><strong>sir ivy</strong>: Oh you ain’t done a damn thing can’t be
undone Playa. The dye ain’t even close t’cast. Y’wanna make some shit
real? No stage, no and lemme say this one time…</p>
<p><strong>sir ivy</strong>: …If you think old man Primo could twist
your shit up…</p>
<p><strong>sir ivy</strong>: …It ain’t nothin’ compared to what I ’bout
to do here. Believe that.</p>
<p><strong>acosta/bill</strong>: I don’t believe this.</p>
<p><strong>acosta/bill</strong>: Battery’s completely dead.</p>
<p><strong>acosta/bill</strong>: Forget it, you won’t get a signal in
here. Have to wait.</p>
<p><strong>carruthers</strong>: Can’t you use the line in here to
contact your people.</p>
<p><strong>acosta/bill</strong>: No, these phones are hardwired directly
to maintenance. Once we reach the penthouse, I can call down and have
the system taken off-line.</p>
<p><strong>locke</strong>: Pasquale Acosta– Mercenary– “El Estrago”–
“The Plague”</p>
<p><strong>locke</strong>: When he was caught by the SAS in Northern
Ireland and imprisoned, he chewed off his fingertips to the bone before
he could be printed and ID’d by Interpol.</p>
<p><strong>carruthers</strong>: Can’t maintenance do that?</p>
<p><strong>acosta/bill</strong>: Do what?</p>
<p><strong>carruthers</strong>: Shut the elevators down.</p>
<p><strong>acosta/bill</strong>: An emergency shut down of our entire
elevated lift system? No sir. That has to be handled by my staff.</p>
<p><strong>carruthers</strong>: How long have you worked here? Bill.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Girl, you hear that!?</p>
<p><strong>watters</strong>: Are you anywhere near the penthouse?</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: No, but that definitely sounds like shots and
I don’t where it’s comin’ from–</p>
<p><strong>watters</strong>: –It’s your IFB, somebody else has got an
earpiece, you’re picking up their signal–</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: –I thought we had secure frequency. Aww girl,
tell me this mafucka ain’t goin’ off right now.</p>
<p><strong>watters</strong>: …Oh, fuck these fools…</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>watters</strong>: Security’s locking down the elevators.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Please remain calm…Elevator service
has been temporarily suspended and will resume momentarily…</p>
<p><strong>darwin tremor</strong>: Les’ get at it then.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: Okay sweetie, now I’m a registered nurse and
this was my bath not a half hour ago, so it ain’t as hot as it could be,
but we’re gonna get you all toasty warm in no time– Warren, Warren– go
on an’ get grandma her hot blanket and her heating bag, the one in there
under the sink in my bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Slower Nana. Talk slooooooeerrrrr.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: Okay Shug…Grandma needs you to go in–</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: Oh, you little foxy, trying to fool your
Nana! You heard me didn’t you!?</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: Now Boogie, Grandma needs her big helper boy
now, go on an’ get those things and grandma’ll rub your feet!</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: My karate feet? My crazy Karate kick
feet!!</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: You little angel-butt! Grandma’ll rub those
feet forever!</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: Oh you silly-sil! Never mind, Grandma’ll get

<p><strong>warren</strong>: Bow to your opponent!</p>
<p><strong>elmore</strong>: Pl– kid, st– stop…</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: –the two men slain here earlier today as
authorities speculate as to the apparent disappearance of a third. The
names of the victims are being withheld, pending notification of family
members, but Action Seven has learned that one of the deceased,
identified as Jack Dupree–</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: –was a resident of Las Vegas, Nevada–</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: …holy shit, shit, shit…</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: We’ve also learned that Mr. Dupree was
employed as a process server and bondsman for Draygo Bail Bonds and may
have been in this area on a fugitive apprehension–</p>
<p><strong>padiche</strong>: …uh oh…</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: A rental vehicle, registered in
Mr. Dupree’s name, has been recovered in the parking lot of the nearby
Nomad Hotel &amp; Casino…</p>
<p><strong>hugo</strong>: Shit…answer the fucking phone.</p>
<p><strong>sir ivy</strong>: Y’ain’t never had to wash another man’s
blood off, dig it out y’fingernails…Y’had us for that. Y’ain’t ever made
a real beef on y’own, shit as light in the ass as you are, I’ll bet you
ain’t ever made anything more than a fuck’n fist your whole life. So if
you think I’mma let your lil’ punk-ass, with the dirt I’ve done for you,
in the eleventh hour, sell me off like some fucking field nigger, hand
me up to the Feds like y’last chip, then you done gone straight
out-your-motherfucking MIND!</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: That’s Mecklen. The deal’s closing. I can
pick that phone up and I can work this out.</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: You’ll walk with me.</p>
<p><strong>sir ivy</strong>: All that slight a’hand you can do and you
still ain’t never learned to lie right–</p>
<p><strong>mustache</strong>: Are you hit?</p>
<p><strong>mustache</strong>: Mr. Israel!?</p>
<p><strong>mustache</strong>: Are you hurt sir!?</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: Ivy’s trying to kill me!</p>
<p><strong>mustache</strong>: Drop-that-gun-right-now!</p>
<p><strong>security member #1</strong>: Jesus, he got Beanie… He shot
Beanie!</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: Jesus Christ…</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: …you just murdered Beanie…</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: Hey! Get him out– muscle him if you have to.
Take him down the quietly, use the service exit. Then get back up here
and we’ll handle the rest of this. What? Is there somebody else in
there?</p>
<p><strong>vitoli</strong>: Eees Vitoli.</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: Avert your eyes gents, y’didn’t see that.
Okay Vitoli, listen these last few minutes make you a material witness,
do you understand what that means?</p>
<p><strong>vitoli</strong>: …How can I be of assistance…</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: You do know what that means! Tremendous,
that’s the attitude. Alright, Vitoli, hang tight for half a tic, we’ve
got a special sort of “clean-up” we gotta do here, alright?</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: What’s he doing, is he getting this?</p>
<p><strong>mustache</strong>: Yeah, he’s nodding.</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: Good. Now Move.</p>
<p><strong>security team</strong>: Wait…one of ’em looks like it’s on

<p><strong>mustache</strong>: The hell is going on…</p>
<p><strong>watters</strong>: …Forget it, it’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: It ain’t dead! Quit saying that shit!</p>
<p><strong>watters</strong>: Girl, I just saw muzzle flashes comin’ out

jus’ downed Israel. He dead, our play is dead.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: I’m not givin’ it up jus’ yet…</p>
<p><strong>watters</strong>: C’mon, I say we bounce now, kick it for a

<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Right now? …Dying.</p>

<p><strong>margie</strong>: Them was left over from my hysterectomy, so

<p><strong>margie</strong>: You sure you don’t want me to call an
ambulance honey?</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: I think it’s crazy you not going in…y’got

amputatin’ if y’don’t get it treated.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: Warren! Now you go and practice your
nunchucks now, leave us be for a bit Shug.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: …M’sorry about that boy, his momma abandoned
him going on a year now, his daddy, my boy Dale– Gulf War vet, s’over in
the Reno-Washoe Correctional facility– got some “clarity” issues. He did
some home invasion sodomy-torture type stuff, wrote a buncha bad checks,
got hisself consecutive life terms– shipped off to Soledad there in
California. –reminds me, I got that care package I need to send off–
Anyhoo, m’husband Bill took the coward’s route, n’committed suicide by
hangin’ ’bout nine months back. Ever since then, little Boogie there’s
been the man’a the house! And we make a darn cute couple I think!</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: I don’t think that’s been opened since my
husband died.</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: I want you to locate Agent Carruthers now.
The guests that aren’t able to leave need to be confined to their
suites. And under no circumstances are they to venture out, for any
reason. Have the staff make calls to that effect.</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: This him?</p>
<p><strong>fbi agent</strong>: Alright Ricky, I want you to explain to
Agent Messner exactly what happened and do it slowly please.</p>
<p><strong>casino employee</strong>: Yeah, ye– I– uh, there were,
earlier, there was that guy Carrut–</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: –Agent Carruthers. Do you know where is he
now?</p>
<p><strong>casino employee</strong>: He uh– he asked about– I’m– he
wanted to know whic– what floor security was on, then I saw him get on
the elevator with the other agent.</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: Wait a minute, what other agent? What other
agent?</p>
<p><strong>fbi agent</strong>: I have no idea. It wasn’t anybody from
our office.</p>
<p><strong>casino employee</strong>: He said he was from San
Francisco.</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: Did he give you his name?</p>
<p><strong>casino employee</strong>: Yeah, uh– it was Spanish-somethin’
Garcia, or Diego, uh–</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: –run both those names through the D.C.
database. Call San Francisco, see if they’ve got anybody in the field
doing collateral inquiries for–</p>
<p><strong>casino employee</strong>: –he was wearing one of our
jackets.</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>casino employee</strong>: The other agent. He said he was
here to do an inspection and later, when he got on the elevator with the
other guy, Carruthers, I saw him wearing one of our security
jackets…</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: This man wearing the jacket identified
himself as an Federal agent?</p>
<p><strong>casino employee</strong>: Uh, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: You’re sure?</p>
<p><strong>casino employee</strong>: Yeah, he had the badge and
everything. It said “FBI” on it.</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: And when you saw him later, he was wearing
one of your security jackets–</p>
<p><strong>casino employee</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: And that didn’t seem odd to you?</p>
<p><strong>casino employee</strong>: I– I mean, I thought they gave it
to him so he cou–</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: We may have a man posing as one of us. Get
a tactical team assembled. We need to get to the penthouse level
immediately.</p>
<p><strong>fbi agent</strong>: We’ll have to power the elevators back
up.</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: Do it.</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: Fucking things falling asleep…</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: Vitoli, just sit tight for a second, I gotta
make a phone call, figure this out…</p>
<p><strong>bodyguard #1</strong>: One of ’em on it’s way up. This
doesn’t make any sense, what’s wrong with the rest of ’em?</p>

<p><strong>hugo</strong>: Vitoli? What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>gill</strong>: It’s okay, it’s okay Hugo… Mr. Soot, I’m
Doctor Gill.</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: Doc– y– wha– what is this?</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: Two man cover formation, far end, the
elevator is open, possible aggression inside, watch for fire–</p>
<p><strong>messner’s voice</strong>: –watch for fire…</p>
<p><strong>messner’s voice</strong>: Stay low, breach on my mark…</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Shar…Fourteen, I’m pinched– I need some heavy
shit, fire-from- heaven…my count.</p>
<p><strong>watters pov</strong>: Fourteenth floor, big glass windows,
drawn curtains…she nuzzles the eyepiece, finger slipping delicately
inside the trigger guard…waiting.</p>
<p><strong>watters</strong>: Bet.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Bring it.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Are these feds fake or for real girl!</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Jus’ keep doin’ y’damage girl, keep these
mafuckas off my as–</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: We’re out girl! I’m shot! I’M SHOT!–</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: How bad?</p>
<p><strong>carruthers</strong>: Mortal.</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>carruthers</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Girl, I’m inside, I’m on my way up– this
elevator is going to the Penthouse– can you hear me–? Baby, can you hear
me–</p>
<p><strong>watters</strong>: Sit tight if you can hear me Girl! I can’t
do shit for you from here. I’m moving down for a sightline!</p>
<p><strong>watters</strong>: Girl, where are you– talk to me…how bad are

<p><strong>watters</strong>: Georgia goddamn baby, please talk to me,
please say somethin’ so–</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Drop that hammer… And I drop this one. Know a
killer motherfucker…know they voice. Know they feel…and know you ’bout
to die by one.</p>
<p><strong>israel</strong>: …forgive me…</p>
<p><strong>agent #1</strong>: Let me see your hands!</p>
<p><strong>sir ivy</strong>: This woman’s been shot, I need to get her
medical attention immediately!</p>
<p><strong>locke</strong>: Soot?</p>
<p><strong>locke</strong>: Would you join us please…</p>
<p><strong>locke</strong>: Where are Carruthers and Messner?</p>
<p><strong>agent #1</strong>: Agent Carruthers was killed sir, Agent
Messner is unaccounted for.</p>
<p><strong>locke</strong>: Account for him.</p>
<p><strong>sir ivy</strong>: What’s your name baby girl…</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: …Georgia.</p>
<p><strong>sir ivy</strong>: Georgia on my mind wit’yo fine ass. You
know you saved this black man.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: You know I did baby… And a deep, dark one at
that. Now if you ain’t a dog, which you don’t look like–</p>
<p><strong>sir ivy</strong>: –never in a million girl–</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: –good, then all you got to be is
grateful.</p>
<p><strong>sir ivy</strong>: No doubt. That’s my moms there, taught me
them skills.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: You love her?</p>
<p><strong>sir ivy</strong>: My mamma? C’mon shorty, y’gotta ask? You
hurtin’ pretty bad?</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Got hit twice.</p>
<p><strong>sir ivy</strong>: It’s going around ain’t it? Mafuckas
catching bullets like the common cold up in this bitch. I think I
accidentally shot and killed my boy today.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Well, if it’s any comfort, I’s goin’ in to
there to act a fool baby. Straight rockin’ heat and slayin’ niggas–</p>
<p><strong>sir ivy</strong>: For real?</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Mmm-hmm…and your boy very well mighta been
one of ’em.</p>
<p><strong>sir ivy</strong>: True?</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Like a mafucka.</p>
<p><strong>sir ivy</strong>: That takes some of the sting out.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: I probably woulda busted on you too …and what
a shame that woulda been.</p>
<p><strong>sir ivy</strong>: I feel like I know you girl. I feel like
I’ve known you forever. You gonna lemme see your scars?</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: You do the right thing. Sit with me while I
heal, let it develop slow.</p>
<p><strong>sir ivy</strong>: What were you doin’ here anyway?</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: ’Spose to kill this fool named Buddy
Israel.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Damn baby girl, you makin’ a nigga fall hard
now.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Don’t play out this string, ‘cuz it’s real
short I didn’t do your man downstairs. I found him that way. Now whether
or not you believe that ain’t the least bit important. We either goin’
work this out and live, or stay doin’ the shit we been doin’ and die.
Now I got no beef with you, or wit ya’ll bureau…so you better off jus’
movin’ on &amp; lettin’ us be.</p>
<p><strong>reveal</strong>: The Swede, still accompanied by the Sparazza
goons, arriving in the elevator at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>dr. gill</strong>: Dr. Ingstrom, he’s had a mild cardiac
episode and recurring arrhythmia, I’ve given him 60cc’s of
Nobuneatol…</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: …Deputy Director Locke?</p>
<p><strong>locke</strong>: Here. Sit. Please.</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: This is him? The hitman hired to kill
Israel? He’s a doctor?</p>
<p><strong>locke</strong>: Difficult to explain everything now… And much
larger issues loom. I’m sorry about Carruthers…Damndest thing to have to
die for.</p>
<p><strong>locke</strong>: Very well. Take Mr. Israel to the roof, he’ll
be traveling with us.</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: What the hell– What is this!? People died.
Agent Carruthers is dead!</p>
<p><strong>locke</strong>: We have to transport Mr. Israel to Las Vegas,
time is of the essence. The gulfstream is standing by on the jetway at
Tahoe International. I’m sorry, I’m restricted from disclosing anymore
information. Return to Washington. You’ll be debriefed in the coming
days.</p>
<p><strong>watters</strong>: …I loved you baby…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Hey…</p>
<p><strong>elmore</strong>: That your car?</p>
<p><strong>darwin tremor</strong>: No, I’m confiscating it.</p>
<p><strong>elmore</strong>: You’re F.B.I.?</p>
<p><strong>darwin tremor</strong>: That’s right…and I’d advise y’ta
lower your weapon sir.</p>
<p><strong>elmore</strong>: You investigating those murders out at the
lake?</p>
<p><strong>darwin tremor</strong>: Ww…uh…</p>
<p><strong>elmore</strong>: Three men were ambushed and shot, two died
and had their bodies tossed into the lake, the other has severe
hypothermia, possible dementia and will probably be a multiple amputee
by week’s end…if he even lives that long.</p>
<p><strong>darwin tremor</strong>: No, I ain’t even heard abou–</p>
<p><strong>elmore</strong>: You “ain’t”– You have any idea how close to
death I’ve been? You understand that I’m dying now? That I’ve survived
bullets and frostbite and raging fever– missing fingers and every
fucking imaginable horror in between?</p>
<p><strong>elmore</strong>: And I’m asking you now, “Is that your car”
and you can’t even come clean and do me the decency of a straight
answer, with the fucking state that I’m in!?</p>
<p><strong>darwin tremor</strong>: Yeah, shit– hell, you’re right. I’m
sorry.</p>
<p><strong>elmore</strong>: You shot me and murdered my friends.</p>
<p><strong>darwin tremor</strong>: I did. We– yeah, I know.</p>
<p><strong>elmore</strong>: And threw us into the lake.</p>
<p><strong>darwin tremor</strong>: Pretty much, yep.</p>
<p><strong>elmore</strong>: And this is your car, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>darwin tremor</strong>: Mmm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>elmore</strong>: But there were more of you?</p>
<p><strong>darwin tremor</strong>: Yeah, m’brothers…They didn’t make
it.</p>
<p><strong>elmore</strong>: Two of ’em?</p>
<p><strong>darwin tremor</strong>: Thass’ right. I got other brother’s
though, so it ain’t so bad.</p>
<p><strong>elmore</strong>: You were here huntin’ a man named Israel,
weren’t you? Your name is Tremor.</p>
<p><strong>darwin tremor</strong>: I was. It is…That who you was here
for? Israel?</p>
<p><strong>darwin tremor</strong>: Well…we both got beat out then,
didn’t we?</p>
<p><strong>elmore</strong>: Yes we did… Now, give me your car keys. And
get the fuck out of here.</p>
<p><strong>darwin tremor</strong>: S’fair…lemme just grab somethin’.</p>
<p><strong>darwin tremor</strong>: No, no, no, I’m done with all
that.</p>
<p><strong>darwin tremor</strong>: Probably needs to be tuned. Air
filter’s old. Plugs might be bad. Heater and AC ain’t worked in forever.
There’s some good drugs in the glove box there, homespun, keep you
smiling, semi-lucid at leas’… Well, God’s speed t’ya then. Sorry ‘bout
all that. S’way a’the world though, winners and losers y’know. S’way
it’s always goin’ be…</p>
<p><strong>elmore</strong>: …Oh, fuck that…</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: Your friends were taken to Carson City
Memorial, they’re going to be autopsied and shipped back for burial.</p>
<p><strong>elmore</strong>: I’ll take care of it.</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: Who owned this car?</p>
<p><strong>elmore</strong>: The ones that killed ’em.</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: Where are they now?</p>
<p><strong>elmore</strong>: I just want to go home man…I just want to go
home and forget this fucking place even exists.</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: Where’s that? Home.</p>
<p><strong>elmore</strong>: Las Vegas.</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: You’re injured…Let me drive.</p>
<p><strong>orderly</strong>: Are you with the group on the third
floor?</p>
<p><strong>orderly</strong>: Very well. You can take that stairwell up,
the I.C.U. is at the end of the hall.</p>
<p><strong>locke</strong>: …for a press release. Officially, he took his
own life, suicide by hanging, something of that sort. Basic bullet
points– despondent over the turn his career had taken, troubles with the
law, history of substance abuse and so on–</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: Where’s Israel?</p>
<p><strong>locke</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: My debrief–</p>
<p><strong>locke</strong>: –will be handled back in–</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: –no, we need to handle it now.</p>
<p><strong>locke</strong>: You were given instructions to get on that
plane and return to Washington–</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: You’re going to tell me why no call was
made to inform us that the Israel situation had been “altered.” Why I–
and my friend and partner, whose body is going into a furnace tomorrow,
were not sufficiently apprised of Bureau movement on this matter.</p>
<p><strong>locke</strong>: I can’t discuss–</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: –You can and you will.</p>
<p><strong>locke</strong>: You’re finished.</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: And you just figured that out? The Swede
isn’t a hitman, is he? He’s a surgeon. Sparazza didn’t want Israel’s
heart for a trophy, he wanted it for a transplant…why?</p>
<p><strong>locke</strong>: …They’re father and son…</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: …A paternity suit, filed 1967…</p>
<p><strong>locke</strong>: –Brought against Sparazza by Israel’s mother
Laverne who was nineteen at the time. They had a brief affair which
Israel was the by-product of.</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: …Does he know?</p>
<p><strong>locke</strong>: …He does now…</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: So the wiretaps of Padiche and Serna–</p>
<p><strong>serna</strong>: –some Swede, real badass, supposedly a
“specialist”</p>
<p><strong>locke</strong>: Dr. Sven Ingstrom is head of cardiology at
Stockholm University and the foremost heart specialist in all of
Europe–</p>
<p><strong>locke</strong>: Sparazza was in failing health and looking
for a donor. The son who had betrayed and burned him so thoroughly
seemed a obvious choice.</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: So all of our intel was bogus to begin
with.</p>
<p><strong>locke</strong>: Yes. The actual contract went to Lazlo Soot,
the man that plunged to his death from the Penthouse yesterday. He was
to neutralize Israel’s entourage and prep for the removal of his
heart.</p>
<p><strong>locke</strong>: Ingstrom was to handle the surgery itself
on-site with the assistance of Dr. Gregory Gill, Israel’s personal
physician, who was also on the Sparazza payroll.</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: …When did you know all this?</p>
<p><strong>locke</strong>: Information was arriving all day yesterday.
When we finally figured out who Sparazza actually was, we–</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: –What? What do you mean “Who Sparazza
actually was…”</p>
<p><strong>locke</strong>: …Are you insane?</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: …Almost. What do you mean “who Sparazza
actually was…”</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: You realize that Sparraza has had
thirty-six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953?
Elective plastic surgery, every single one–</p>
<p><strong>locke</strong>: It wasn’t elective. It was undertaken to save
his life. And it wasn’t cosmetic, it was reconstructive…Look at the date
of the first procedure.</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: …Yeah, fifty-three.</p>
<p><strong>locke</strong>: The same year that Sparazza murdered Agent
Freeman Heller…</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: …holy shit…that’s Heller… Isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>locke</strong>: Primo Sparazza was Heller’s alias. He went
deep cover in 1940 and stayed under for over ten years, amassing
materials against the mafia and other criminal syndicates. He may have
ripped the organization wide open, pre-Appalachia, but his superiors
were convinced that he had gone rogue, swapped allegiances…So they gave
the order to terminate his cover.</p>
<p><strong>locke</strong>: He survived the shooting but the injuries he
sustained triggered a degenerative bone disease that required constant
surgery, forever altering his features…so he assumed his alias
full-time.</p>
<p><strong>locke</strong>: The figment that was Primo Sparazza became
flesh and blood. Freeman Heller was no more.</p>
<p><strong>carruthers</strong>: –Heller was buried in agency lore-</p>
<p><strong>locke</strong>: The agents of that era are all dead and gone,
history had defaulted to fable…until now. You can imagine the shock this
sent through the corridors of power in D.C. Heller’s op predates the
second world war. That’s over sixty years of intel. Do you know how
valuable that could be? The man’s a treasure trove.</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: …So you made another deal?</p>
<p><strong>locke</strong>: I wouldn’t go that far.</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: But you did, and have…And now people are
dead. Did Sparazza become more valuable than Israel…and did you make
another deal?</p>
<p><strong>locke</strong>: Israel’s agreement with the government was
tossed out. We’re now attempting to rehabilitate him to the point where
a transplant can be attempted.</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: You’re trying to save Sparazza?</p>
<p><strong>locke</strong>: No…We’re trying to save Heller.</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: …So you knew all this and yet y–</p>
<p><strong>locke</strong>: –We needed cohesion to move forward. Not
conjecture.</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: …while Carruthers and a dozen others lie
dying, you debate semantics. The Bureau’s betrayed us… The way they
betrayed him…</p>
<p><strong>locke</strong>: I don’t see it like that at all.</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: No, of course you don’t…of course you
don’t. …I gave all my belief and the better part of my soul to this
Bureau. …Look at the monsters you’ve made… I won’t be one of them.</p>
<p><strong>locke</strong>: I’ll overlook what you’ve done here today in
light of what’s taken place. You’ve been fully debriefed. Now I want you
to return to D.C. immediately and make no further inquiry into this
matter. I mean it. It’s closed.</p>
<p><strong>messner</strong>: No…It’s not.</p>
<p>****: What it lacks…is an end.</p>
