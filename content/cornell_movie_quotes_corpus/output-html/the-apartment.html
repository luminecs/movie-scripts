<h1 id="the-apartment">the-apartment</h1>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: On November first, 1959, the population of New
York City was 8,042,783. if you laid all these people end to end,
figuring an average height of five feet six and a half inches, they
would reach from Times Square to the outskirts of Karachi, Pakistan. I
know facts like this because I work for an insurance company –</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: – Consolidated Life of New York. We are one of
the top five companies in the country – last year we wrote
nine-point-three billion dollars worth of policies. Our home office has
31,259 employees – which is more than the entire population of Natchez,
Mississippi, of Gallup, New Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I work on the nineteenth floor – Ordinary
Policy Department - Premium Accounting Division - Section W – desk
number 861.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: My name is C.C. Baxter - C. for Calvin, C. for
Clifford – however, most people call me Bud. I’ve been with Consolidated
Life for three years and ten months. I started in the branch office in
Cincinnati, then transferred to New York. My take-home pay is $94.70 a
week, and there are the usual fringe benefits.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: The hours in our department are 8:50 to 5:20
–</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: – they’re staggered by floors, so that sixteen
elevators can handle the 31,259 employees without a serious traffic jam.
As for myself, I very often stay on at the office and work for an extra
hour or two – especially when the weather is bad. It’s not that I’m
overly ambitious – it’s just a way of killing time, until it’s all right
for me to go home. You see, I have this little problem with my apartment
–</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I live in the West Sixties - just half a block
from Central Park. My rent is $84 a month. It used to be eighty until
last July when Mrs. Lieberman, the landlady, put in a second-hand air
conditioning unit.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: It’s a real nice apartment - nothing fancy –
but kind of cozy – just right for a bachelor. The only problem is - I
can’t always get in when I want to.</p>
<p><strong>kirkeby</strong>: Come on, Sylvia. It’s getting late.</p>
<p><strong>kirkeby</strong>: Cut it out, Sylvia. We got to get out of
here.</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: What’s the panic? I’m going to have another
martooni.</p>
<p><strong>kirkeby</strong>: Please, Sylvia! It’s a quarter to nine!</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: First you can’t wait to get me up here, and
now – rush, rush, rush! Makes a person feel cheap.</p>
<p><strong>kirkeby</strong>: Sylvia – sweetie – it’s not that – but I
promised the guy I’d be out of here by eight o’clock, positively.</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: What guy? Whose apartment is this,
anyway?</p>
<p><strong>kirkeby</strong>: What’s the difference? Some schnook that
works in the office.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lieberman</strong>: Good evening, Mr. Baxter.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Good evening, Mrs. Lieberman.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lieberman</strong>: Some weather we’re having. Must be
from all the meshugass at Cape Canaveral. You locked out of your
apartment?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: No, no. Just waiting for a friend. Good night,
Mrs. Lieberman.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lieberman</strong>: Good night, Mr. Baxter.</p>
<p><strong>kirkeby</strong>: Come on – come on, Sylvia!</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: Some setup you got here. A real,
honest-to-goodness love nest.</p>
<p><strong>kirkeby</strong>: Sssssh.</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: You’re one button off, Mr. Kirkeby.</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: You got to watch those things. Wives are
getting smarter all the time. Take Mr. Bernheim – in the Claims
Department – came home one night with lipstick on his shirt – told his
wife he had a shrimp cocktail for lunch – so she took it out to the lab
and had it analyzed – so now she has the house in Great Neck and the
children and the new Jaguar –</p>
<p><strong>kirkeby</strong>: Don’t you ever stop talking?</p>
<p><strong>kirkeby</strong>: Where do you live?</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: I told you – with my mother.</p>
<p><strong>kirkeby</strong>: Where does she live?</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: A hundred and seventy-ninth street – the
Bronx.</p>
<p><strong>kirkeby</strong>: All right – I’ll take you to the
subway.</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: Like hell you will. You’ll buy me a cab.</p>
<p><strong>kirkeby</strong>: Why do all you dames have to live in the
Bronx?</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: You mean you bring other girls up here?</p>
<p><strong>kirkeby</strong>: Certainly not. I’m a happily married
man.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Oh. Hello there, Mrs. Dreyfuss.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dreyfuss</strong>: Something the matter?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I seem to have dropped my key. Oh – here it
is.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dreyfuss</strong>: Such a racket I heard in your place –
maybe you had burglars.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Oh, you don’t have to worry about that –
nothing in there that anybody would want to steal… Good night,
Mrs. Dreyfuss.</p>
<p><strong>kirkeby</strong>: The little lady forgot her galoshes.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Mr. Kirkeby, I don’t like to complain – but you
were supposed to be out of here by eight.</p>
<p><strong>kirkeby</strong>: I know, Buddy-boy, I know. But those things
don’t always run on schedule – like a Greyhound bus.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I don’t mind in the summer – but on a rainy
night – and I haven’t had any dinner yet –</p>
<p><strong>kirkeby</strong>: Sure, sure. Look, kid – I put in a good
word for you with Sheldrake, in Personnel.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Mr. Sheldrake?</p>
<p><strong>kirkeby</strong>: That’s right. We were discussing our
department – manpower-wise – and promotion-wise – – and I told him what
a bright boy you were. They’re always on the lookout for young
executives.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Thank you, Mr. Kirkeby.</p>
<p><strong>kirkeby</strong>: You’re on your way up, Buddy-boy. And
you’re practically out of liquor.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I know. Mr. Eichelberger – in the Mortgage Loan
Department – last night he had a little Halloween party here –</p>
<p><strong>kirkeby</strong>: Well, lay in some vodka and some vermouth –
and put my name on it.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Yes, Mr. Kirkeby. You still owe me for the last
two bottles –</p>
<p><strong>kirkeby</strong>: I’ll pay you on Friday. And whatever
happened to those little cheese crackers you used to have around?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Cheese crackers.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfuss</strong>: Good evening, Baxter.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Hi, Doc. Had a late call?</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfuss</strong>: Yeah. Some clown at Schrafft’s 57th
Street ate a club sandwich, and forgot to take out the toothpick.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Oh. ’Bye, Doc.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfuss</strong>: Say, Baxter – the way you’re belting
that stuff, you must have a pair of cast-iron kidneys.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Oh, that’s not me. It’s just that once in a
while, I have some people in for a drink.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfuss</strong>: As a matter of fact, you must be an
iron man all around. From what I hear through the walls, you got
something going for you every night.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I’m sorry if it gets noisy –</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfuss</strong>: Sometimes, there’s a twi-night
double-header. A nebbish like you!</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Yeah. Well – see you, Doc.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfuss</strong>: You know, Baxter – I’m doing some
research at the Columbia Medical Center – and I wonder if you could do
us a favor?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfuss</strong>: When you make out your will – and the
way you’re going, you should – would you mind leaving your body to the
University?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: My body? I’m afraid you guys would be
disappointed. Good night, Doc.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfuss</strong>: Slow down, kid.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: – from the world’s greatest library of
film classics, we proudly present – Greta Garbo – John Barrymore – Joan
Crawford – Wallace Beery – and Lionel Barrymore in –</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: But first, a word from our sponsor. If
you smoke the modern way, don’t be fooled by phony filter claims –</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: And now, Grand Hotel – starring Greta
Garbo, John Barrymore, Joan Crawford – – Wallace Beery, and Lionel
Barrymore. But first – a word from our alternate sponsor. Friends, do
you have wobbly dentures – ?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Hello? – Hello? – yes, this is Baxter.</p>
<p><strong>dobisch</strong>: Hiya, Buddy-boy. I’m in this bar on
Sixty-first Street – and I got to thinking about you – and I figured I’d
give you a little buzz.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Well, that’s very nice of you – but who is
this?</p>
<p><strong>dobisch</strong>: Dobisch – Joe Dobisch, in
Administration.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Oh, yes, Mr. Dobisch. I didn’t recognize your
voice –</p>
<p><strong>dobisch</strong>: That’s okay, Buddy-boy. Now like I was
saying, I’m in this joint on Sixty-first – and I think I got lucky – –
she’s a skater with the Ice Show – – and I thought maybe I could bring
her up for a quiet drink.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I’m sorry, Mr. Dobisch. You know I like to help
you guys out – but it’s sort of late – so why don’t we make it some
other time?</p>
<p><strong>dobisch</strong>: Buddy-boy – she won’t keep that long – not
even on ice. Listen, kid, I can’t pass this up – she looks like Marilyn
Monroe.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I don’t care if it is Marilyn Monroe – I’m
already in bed – and I’ve taken a sleeping pill – so I’m afraid the
answer is no.</p>
<p><strong>dobisch</strong>: Look, Baxter – we’re making out the monthly
efficiency rating – and I’m putting you in the top ten. Now you don’t
want to louse yourself up, do you?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Of course not. But – how can I be efficient in
the office if I don’t get enough sleep at night?</p>
<p><strong>dobisch</strong>: It’s only eleven – and I just want the
place for forty-five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>blonde</strong>: I’m getting lonely. Who are you talking to,
anyway?</p>
<p><strong>dobisch</strong>: My mother.</p>
<p><strong>blonde</strong>: That’s sweet. That’s real sweet.</p>
<p><strong>dobisch</strong>: Make it thirty minutes. What do you say,
Bud?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I’m all out of liquor – and there’s no clean
glasses – no cheese crackers – no nothing.</p>
<p><strong>dobisch</strong>: Let me worry about that. Just leave the key
under the mat and clear out.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Yes, Mr. Dobisch.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Anything you say, Mr. Dobisch – no trouble at
all, Mr. Dobisch – be my guest –</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: – We never close at Buddy-boy’s – looks like
Marilyn Monroe –</p>
<p><strong>blonde</strong>: This the place?</p>
<p><strong>dobisch</strong>: Yeah. How much?</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: Seventy cents.</p>
<p><strong>dobisch</strong>: Get the money, will you?</p>
<p><strong>dobisch</strong>: Watch those stingers!</p>
<p><strong>dobisch</strong>: Give him a buck.</p>
<p><strong>dobisch</strong>: Now put it back, honey. Atta girl.</p>
<p><strong>blonde</strong>: You sure this is a good idea?</p>
<p><strong>dobisch</strong>: Can’t think of a better one.</p>
<p><strong>blonde</strong>: I mean - barging in on your mother – in the
middle of the night?</p>
<p><strong>dobisch</strong>: Don’t worry about the old lady. One squawk
from her, and she’s out of a job.</p>
<p><strong>dobisch</strong>: Get the key, will you.</p>
<p><strong>dobisch</strong>: Not there. Under the mat.</p>
<p><strong>blonde</strong>: Under the mat?</p>
<p><strong>dobisch</strong>: Open up, open up – we haven’t got all
night.</p>
<p><strong>blonde</strong>: So this is your mother’s apartment?</p>
<p><strong>dobisch</strong>: That’s right. Maria Ouspenskaya.</p>
<p><strong>blonde</strong>: Hiya, Ouspenskaya.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfuss</strong>: Mildred – he’s at it again.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Good morning, Mr. Kirkeby.</p>
<p><strong>kirkeby</strong>: Oh, how are you, Baxter. They keeping you
busy these days?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Yes, sir. They are indeed.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Morning, Mr. Kessel – Morning, Miss Robinson –
Morning, Mr. Kirkeby – Morning, Mr. Williams – Morning, Miss Livingston
– Morning, Mr. McKellway – Morning, Mr. Pirelli – Morning, Mrs. Schubert
–</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Morning, Mr. Baxter.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Morning, Miss Kubelik.</p>
<p><strong>starter</strong>: That’s all. Take it away.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Watch the door, please. Blasting off.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: What did you do to your hair?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: It was making me nervous, so I chopped it off.
Big mistake, huh?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I sort of like it.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Say, you got a lulu.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Yeah. I better not get too close.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Oh, I never catch colds.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Really? I was looking at some figures from the
Sickness and Accident Claims Division – do you know that the average New
Yorker between the ages of twenty and fifty has two and a half colds a
year?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: That makes me feel just terrible.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Well, to make the figures come out even –
since I have no colds a year – some poor slob must have five colds a
year.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: That’s me.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: You should have stayed in bed this
morning.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I should have stayed in bed last night.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Nineteen. Watch your step.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: And watch your hand, Mr. Kirkeby!</p>
<p><strong>kirkeby</strong>: I beg your pardon?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: One of these days I’m going to shut those
doors on you and –</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Twenty next.</p>
<p><strong>kirkeby</strong>: That Kubelik – boy! Would I like to get her
on a slow elevator to China.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Oh, yes. She’s the best operator in the
building.</p>
<p><strong>kirkeby</strong>: I’m a pretty good operator myself – but she
just won’t give me a tumble – date-wise.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Maybe you’re using the wrong approach.</p>
<p><strong>kirkeby</strong>: A lot of guys around here have tried it –
all kinds of approaches – no dice. What is she trying to prove?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Could be she’s just a nice, respectable girl –
there are millions of them.</p>
<p><strong>kirkeby</strong>: Listen to him. Little Lord Fauntleroy!</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Hello, Mr. Dobisch? This is Baxter, on the
nineteenth floor.</p>
<p><strong>dobisch</strong>: Oh, Buddy-boy. I was just about to call
you. I’m sorry about that mess on the living room wall. You see, my
little friend, she kept insisting Picasso was a bum – so she started to
do that mural – but I’m sure it will wash off – just eyebrow pencil.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: It’s not Picasso I’m calling about. It’s the
key – to my apartment – you were supposed to leave it under the mat.</p>
<p><strong>dobisch</strong>: I did, didn’t I? I distinctly remember
bending over and putting it there –</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Oh, I found a key there, all right – only it’s
the wrong key.</p>
<p><strong>dobisch</strong>: It is? Well, how about that? No wonder I
couldn’t get into the executive washroom this morning.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: And I couldn’t get into my apartment – so at
four a. m. I had to wake up the landlady and give her a whole song and
dance about going out to mail a letter and the door slamming shut.</p>
<p><strong>dobisch</strong>: That’s a shame. I’ll send the key right
down. And about your promotion – – I’m sending that efficiency report
right up to Mr. Sheldrake, in Personnel. I wouldn’t be surprised if you
heard from him before the day is over.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Thank you, Mr. Dobisch.</p>
<p><strong>messenger</strong>: From Mr. Dobisch.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Wait.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: To Mr. Dobisch.</p>
<p><strong>vanderhof</strong>: Dear Mr. MacIntosh – Vanderhof, Public
Relations. Oh, yes, Baxter. Just a minute. All right, Miss Finch – type
up what we got so far. Now what is it, Baxter?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Look, Mr. Vanderhof – I’ve got you down here
for tonight – but I’m going to be using the place myself – so I’ll have
to cancel.</p>
<p><strong>vanderhof</strong>: Cancel? But it’s her birthday – I already
ordered the cake –</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I hate to disappoint you – I mean, many happy
returns – but not tonight –</p>
<p><strong>vanderhof</strong>: That’s not like you, Baxter. Just the
other day, at the staff meeting, I was telling Mr. Sheldrake what a
reliable man you were.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Thank you, Mr. Vanderhof. But I’m sick – I have
this terrible cold – and a fever – and I got to go to bed right after
work.</p>
<p><strong>vanderhof</strong>: Buddy-boy, that’s the worst thing you can
do. If you got a cold, you should go to a Turkish bath – spend the night
there – sweat it out –</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Oh, no. I’d get pneumonia – and if I got
pneumonia, I’d be in bed for a month – and if I were in bed for a month
–</p>
<p><strong>vanderhof</strong>: Okay, you made your point. We’ll just
have to do it next Wednesday – that’s the only night of the week I can
get away.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Wednesday – Wednesday – I got somebody penciled
in – let me see what I can do – I’ll get back to you.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Mr. Eichelberger? Is this Mortgage and Loan?
I’d like to speak to Mr. Eichelberger. Yes, it is urgent.</p>
<p><strong>associate</strong>: For you, Mel.</p>
<p><strong>eighelberger</strong>: Eichelberger here – oh, yes, Baxter –
What’s your problem? – Wednesday is out? – oh – that throws a little
monkey wrench into my agenda – Thursday? No, I’m all tied up on Thursday
– let’s schedule that meeting for Friday.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Friday? Let me see what I can do. I’ll get back
to you.</p>
<p><strong>kirkeby</strong>: Premium-wise and billing-wise, we are
eighteen percent ahead of last year, October-wise.</p>
<p><strong>kirkeby</strong>: Hello? Yeah, Baxter. What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Instead of Friday – could you possibly switch
to Thursday? You’d be doing me a great favor –</p>
<p><strong>kirkeby</strong>: Well – it’s all right with me, Bud. Let me
check. I’ll get back to you.</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: Consolidated Life – I’ll connect you –
Consolidated Life –</p>
<p><strong>switchboard girl</strong>: Sylvia – it’s for you.</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: Yes? Oh, hello – sure I got home all right –
you owe me forty-five cents.</p>
<p><strong>kirkeby</strong>: Okay, okay. Look, Sylvia – instead of
Friday - could we make it Thursday night?</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: Thursday? That’s The Untouchables – with Bob
Stack.</p>
<p><strong>kirkeby</strong>: Bob WHO? – all right, so we’ll watch it at
the apartment. Big deal. Baxter? It’s okay for Thursday.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Thank you, Mr. Kirkeby. Mr. Eichelberger? It’s
okay for Friday. Mr. Vanderhof? It’s okay for Wednesday.</p>
<p><strong>moffett</strong>: All right – I’ll tell him. Hey, Baxter –
that was Personnel. Mr. Sheldrake’s secretary.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Sheldrake?</p>
<p><strong>moffett</strong>: She’s been trying to reach you for the last
twenty minutes. They want you up stairs.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>moffett</strong>: What gives, Baxter? You getting promoted or
getting fired?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Care to make a small wager?</p>
<p><strong>moffett</strong>: I’ve been here twice as long as you have
–</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Shall we say – a dollar?</p>
<p><strong>moffett</strong>: It’s a bet.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Going up?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Twenty-seven, please. And drive carefully.
You’re carrying precious cargo – I mean, manpower-wise.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Twenty-seven.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: You may not realize it, Miss Kubelik, but I’m
in the top ten – efficiency-wise and this may be the day –
promotion-wise.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: You’re beginning to sound like Mr. Kirkeby
already.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Why not? Now that they’re kicking me upstairs
–</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Couldn’t happen to a nicer guy. You know,
you’re the only one around here who ever takes his hat off in the
elevator.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: The characters you meet. Something happens to
men in elevators. Must be the change of altitude – the blood rushes to
their head, or something – boy, I could tell you stories –</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I’d love to hear them. Maybe we could have
lunch in the cafeteria sometime – or some evening, after work –</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Twenty-seven.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: I hope everything goes all right.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I hope so. Wouldn’t you know they’d call me on
a day like this – with my cold and everything – How do I look?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Fine. Wait.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Thank you. That’s the first thing I ever
noticed about you – when you were still on the local elevator – you
always wore a flower –</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Good luck. And wipe your nose.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: C. C. Baxter – Ordinary Premium Accounting –
Mr. Sheldrake called me.</p>
<p><strong>miss olsen</strong>: I called you – that is, I tried to call
you – for twenty minutes.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I’m sorry, I –</p>
<p><strong>miss olsen</strong>: Go on in.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Baxter?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: I was sort of wondering what you looked
like. Sit down.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Been hearing some very nice things about
you – here’s a report from Mr. Dobisch – loyal, cooperative, resourceful
–</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Mr. Dobisch said that?</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: And Mr. Kirkeby tells me that several
nights a week you work late at the office – without overtime.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Well, you know how it is – things pile up.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Mr. Vanderhof, in Public Relations, and
Mr. Eichelberger, in Mortgage and Loan – they’d both like to have you
transferred to their departments.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: That’s very flattering.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Tell me, Baxter – just what is it that
makes you so popular?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Think.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Would you mind repeating the question?</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Look, Baxter, I’m not stupid. I know
everything that goes on in this building – in every department – on
every floor – every day of the year.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: You do?</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: In 1957, we had an employee here, name of
Fowler. He was very popular, too. Turned out he was running a bookie
joint right in the Actuarial Department tying up the switchboard,
figuring the odds on our I.B.M. machines – so the day before the
Kentucky Derby, I called in the Vice Squad and we raided the thirteenth
floor.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: The Vice Squad?</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: That’s right, Baxter.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: What – what’s that got to do with me? I’m not
running any bookie joint.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: What kind of joint are you running?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: There’s a certain key floating around the
office – from Kirkeby to Vanderhof to Eichelberger to Dobisch – it’s the
key to a certain apartment – and you know who that apartment belongs
to?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Loyal, cooperative, resourceful C. C.
Baxter.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Are you going to deny it?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: No, sir. I’m not going to deny it. But if you’d
just let me explain –</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: You better.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Well, about six months ago – I was going to
night school, taking this course in Advanced Accounting – and one of the
guys in our department – he lives in Jersey – he was going to a banquet
at the Biltmore – his wife was meeting him in town, and he needed
someplace to change into a tuxedo – so I gave him the key and word must
have gotten around – because the next thing I knew, all sorts of guys
were suddenly going to banquets – and when you give the key to one guy,
you can’t say no to another and the whole thing got out of hand – pardon
me.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Baxter, an insurance company is founded
on public trust. Any employee who conducts himself in a manner
unbecoming – How many charter members are there in this little club of
yours?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Just those four – out of a total of 31,259 – so
actually, we can be very proud of our personnel – percentage-wise.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: That’s not the point. Four rotten apples
in a barrel – no matter how large the barrel – you realize that if this
ever leaked out –</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Oh, it won’t. Believe me. And it’s not going to
happen again. From now on, nobody is going to use my apartment –</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Where is your apartment?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: West 67th Street. You have no idea what I’ve
been going through – with the neighbors and the landlady and the liquor
and the key –</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: How do you work it with the key?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Well, usually I slip it to them in the office
and they leave it under the mat – but never again – I can promise you
that –</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Yes, Miss Olsen.</p>
<p><strong>miss olsen</strong>: Mrs. Sheldrake returning your call – on
two –</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Yes, dear – I called you earlier – where
were you? Oh, you took Tommy to the dentist –</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Where are you going, Baxter?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Well, I don’t want to intrude – and I thought –
since it’s all straightened out anyway –</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: I’m not through with you yet.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: The reason I called is – I won’t be home
for dinner tonight. The branch manager from Kansas City is in town – I’m
taking him to the theatre Music Man, what else? No, don’t wait up for me
– ’bye, darling. Tell me something, Baxter – have you seen Music
Man?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Not yet. But I hear it’s one swell show.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: How would you like to go tonight?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: You mean – you and me? I thought you were
taking the branch manager from Kansas City –</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: I made other plans. You can have both
tickets.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Well, that’s very kind of you – only I’m not
feeling well – you see, I have this cold – and I thought I’d go straight
home.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Baxter, you’re not reading me. I told you
I have plans.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: So do I – I’m going to take four aspirins and
get into bed – so you better give the tickets to somebody else –</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: I’m not just giving those tickets, Baxter
– I want to swap them.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Swap them? For what?</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: It also says here – that you are alert,
astute, and quite imaginative –</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Oh? Oh!</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: This?</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: That’s good thinking, Baxter. Next month
there’s going to be a shift in personnel around here – and as far as I’m
concerned, you’re executive material.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I am?</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Now put down the key – – and put down the
address.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: It’s on the second floor - my name is not on
the door – it just says</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Oh – terribly sorry. It’s that cold –</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Relax, Baxter.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Thank you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: You’ll be careful with the record player, won’t
you? And about the liquor – I ordered some this morning – but I’m not
sure when they’ll deliver it –</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Now remember, Baxter – this is going to
be our little secret.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Yes, of course.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: You know how people talk.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Oh, you don’t have to worry –</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Not that I have anything to hide.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Oh, no sir. Certainly not. Anyway, it’s none of
my business – four apples, five apples – what’s the difference –
percentage-wise?</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Here you are, Baxter. Have a nice
time.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: You too, sir.</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: So I figure, a man in his position, he’s
going to take me to 21 and El Morocco – instead, he takes me to Hamburg
Heaven and some schnook’s apartment –</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Oh – Miss Kubelik. I’ve been waiting for
you.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: You have?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I almost didn’t recognize you – this is the
first time I’ve ever seen you in civilian clothes.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: How’d you make out on the twenty- seventh
floor?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Great. Look – have you seen The Music Man?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Would you like to?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I thought maybe we could have a bite to eat
first – and then –</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: You mean tonight?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: I’m sorry, but I can’t tonight. I’m meeting
somebody.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Oh. You mean – like a girl-friend?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: No. Like a man.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I wasn’t trying to be personal – it’s just that
the fellows in the office were – whether you wondering about you ever
–</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Just tell ’em – now and then.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: This date – is it just a date – or is it
something serious?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: It used to be serious – at least I was – but
he wasn’t – so the whole thing is more or less kaputt.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Well, in that case, couldn’t you – ?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: I’m afraid not. I promised to have a drink
with him – he’s been calling me all week –</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Oh, I understand.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Well, it was just an idea – I hate to see a
ticket go to waste –</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: What time does the show go on?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Eight-thirty.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Well – I could meet you at the theatre – if
that’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: All right? That’s wonderful! It’s the Majestic
– 44th Street.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Meet you in the lobby. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: You know, I felt so lousy this morning – a
hundred and one fever – then my promotion came up – now you and I –
eleventh row center – and you said I should have stayed in bed.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: How is your cold?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: What cold? And after the show, we could go out
on the town – I’ve been taking from Arthur Murray.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: So I see.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: They got a great little band at El Chico, in
the Village – it’s practically around the corner from where you
live.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Sounds good. How do you know where I live?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Oh, I even know who you live with – your sister
and brother-in- law – I know when you were born – and where – I know all
sorts of things about you.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: How come?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: A couple of months ago I looked up your card in
the group insurance file.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I know your height, your weight and your Social
Security number – you had mumps, you had measles, and you had your
appendix out.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Well, don’t tell the fellows in the office
about the appendix. They may get the wrong idea how you found out.
’Bye.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Eight-thirty!</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Good evening, Mr. Sheldrake.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Please, Fran – not so loud.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Still afraid somebody may see us together?</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Let me take that.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: No, Jeff. I can’t stay very long. Can I have a
frozen daiquiri?</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: It’s on the way. I see you went ahead and
cut your hair.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: You know I liked it better long.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Yes, I know. You want a lock to carry in your
wallet?</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Evening, lady. Nice see you again.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: How long has it been – a month?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Six weeks. But who’s counting?</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: I missed you, Fran.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Like old times. Same booth, same song –</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: It’s been hell.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: – same sauce – sweet and sour.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: You don’t know what it’s like – standing
next to you in that elevator, day after day – Good morning, Miss Kubelik
– Good night, Mr. Sheldrake – I’m still crazy about you, Fran.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Let’s not start on that again, Jeff – please.
I’m just beginning to get over it.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: I don’t believe you.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Look, Jeff – we had two wonderful months this
summer – and that was it. Happens all the time – the wife and kids go
away to the country, and the boss has a fling with the secretary or the
manicurist – or the elevator girl. Comes September, the picnic is over –
goodbye. The kids go back to school, the boss goes back to the wife, and
the girl – They don’t make these shrimp like they used to.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: I never said goodbye, Fran.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: For a while there, you try kidding yourself
that you’re going with an unmarried man. Then one day he keeps looking
at his watch, and asks you if there’s any lipstick showing, then rushes
off to catch the seven-fourteen to White Plains. So you fix yourself a
cup of instant coffee – and you sit there by yourself – and you think –
and it all begins to look so ugly –</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: How do you think I felt – riding home on
that seven-fourteen train?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Why do you keep calling me, Jeff? What do you
want from me?</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: I want you back, Fran.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake – I’m full up. You’ll
have to take the next elevator.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: You’re not giving me a chance, Fran. I
asked you to meet me because – I have something to tell you.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Go ahead – tell me.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Not here, Fran. Can’t we go some place
else?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: No. I have a date at eight-thirty.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Important?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Not very – but I’m going to be there
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: You ready order dinner now?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: No. No dinner.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Bring us two more drinks.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Fran – remember that last weekend we
had?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Do I. That leaky little boat you rented – and
me in a black negligee and a life preserver –</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Remember what we talked about?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: We talked about a lot of things.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: I mean – about my getting a divorce.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: We didn’t talk about it – you did.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: You didn’t really believe me, did
you?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: They got it an a long playing record now -
Music to String Her Along By. My wife doesn’t understand me – We haven’t
gotten along for years – You’re the best thing that ever happened to me
–</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: That’s enough, Fran.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Just trust me, baby – we’ll work it out
somehow –</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: You’re not being funny.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: I wasn’t trying.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: If you’ll just listen to me for a minute
–</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Okay. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: I saw my lawyer this morning – I wanted
his advice – about the best way to handle it –</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Handle what?</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Let’s get something straight, Jeff – I never
asked you to leave your wife.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Of course not. You had nothing to do with
it.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Are you sure that’s what you want?</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: I’m sure. If you’ll just tell me that you
still love me –</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: You know I do.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Fran –</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Jeff – darling –</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: It is crowding up. Let’s get out of
here.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Taxi!</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: I have that date – remember?</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: I love you – remember?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Where are we going, Jeff? Not back to that
leaky boat –</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: I promise.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: 51 West Sixty-Seventh.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Would you mind –? C. C. Baxter – that’s me.</p>
<p><strong>kirkeby’s voice</strong>: Hi, Buddy-boy.</p>
<p><strong>dobisch’s voice</strong>: Congratulations, and all that
jazz.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Hi, fellas.</p>
<p><strong>eichelberger</strong>: Well, you made it, kid – just like we
promised.</p>
<p><strong>vanderhof</strong>: Quite an office – name on the door – rug
on the floor – the whole schmear.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>dobisch</strong>: Teamwork – that’s what counts in an
organization like this. All for one and one for all – know what I
mean?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I have a vague idea.</p>
<p><strong>kirkeby</strong>: Baxter, we’re a little disappointed in you
– gratitude-wise.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Oh, I’m very grateful.</p>
<p><strong>eighelberger</strong>: Then why are you locking us out, all
of a sudden?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: It’s been sort of rough these last few weeks –
what with my cold and like that –</p>
<p><strong>dobisch</strong>: We went to bat for you – and now you won’t
play ball with us.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Well, after all, it’s my apartment – it’s
private property – it’s not a public playground.</p>
<p><strong>vanderhof</strong>: All right, so you got yourself a girl –
that’s okay with us – but not every night of the week.</p>
<p><strong>kirkeby</strong>: How selfish can you get? Last week I had to
borrow my nephew’s car and take Sylvia to a drive-in in Jersey. I’m too
old for that sort of thing – I mean, in a Volkswagen.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I sympathize with your problem – and believe
me, I’m very sorry –</p>
<p><strong>dobisch</strong>: You’ll be a lot sorrier before we’re
through with you.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: You threatening me?</p>
<p><strong>dobisch</strong>: Listen, Baxter, we made you and we can
break you.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Good morning, Mr. Sheldrake.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Morning, gentlemen. Everything
satisfactory? You like your office?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Oh, yes, sir. Very much. And I want to thank
you –</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Don’t thank me – thank your friends here
– they’re the ones who recommended you.</p>
<p><strong>dobisch</strong>: We just dropped in to wish him the
best.</p>
<p><strong>kirkeby</strong>: So long, Baxter. We know you won’t let us
down.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: So long, fellas. Drop in any time. The door is
always open – to my office.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: I like the way you handled that. Well,
how does it feel to be an executive?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Fine. And I want you to know I’ll work very
hard to justify your confidence in me –</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Sure you will. Say, Baxter, about the
apartment - now that you got a raise, don’t you think we can afford a
second key?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Well – I guess so.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: You know my secretary – Miss Olsen –</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Oh, yes. Very attractive. Is she – the lucky
one?</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: No, you don’t understand. She’s a
busybody – always poking her nose into things – and with that key
passing back and forth – why take chances?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Yes, sir. You can’t be too careful.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I have something here – I think it belongs to
you.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: To me?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I mean – the young lady – whoever she may be –
it was on the couch when I got home last night.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Oh, yes. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: The mirror is broken. It was broken when I
found it.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: So it was. She threw it at me.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: You know how it is – sooner or later they
all give you a bad time.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I know how it is.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: You see a girl a couple of times a week –
just for laughs – and right away she thinks you’re going to divorce your
wife. I ask you – is that fair?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: No, sir. That’s very unfair – especially to
your wife.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Yeah. You know, Baxter, I envy you.
Bachelor – all the dames you want – no headaches, no complications –</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Yes, sir. That’s the life, all right.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Put me down for Thursday again.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Roger. And I’ll get that other key.</p>
<p><strong>operators</strong>: Consolidated Life – Merry Christmas –
I’ll connect you – Consolidated Life – Merry Christmas – I’m ringing
–</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: Yeah? – YEAH? – Where? – You bet –</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: Somebody watch my line – there’s a swinging
party up on the nineteenth floor –</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: – so I said to him: Never again! – either
get yourself a bigger car or a smaller girl –</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Miss Kubelik.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Marry Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Thank you. I thought you were avoiding me.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: What gave you that idea?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: In the last six weeks you’ve only been in my
elevator once – and then you didn’t take your hat off.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Well, as a matter of fact, I was rather hurt
when you stood me up that night –</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: I don’t blame you. It was unforgivable.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I forgive you.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: You shouldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: You couldn’t help yourself. I mean, when you’re
having a drink with one man, you can’t just suddenly walk out on him
because you have another date with another man. You did the only decent
thing.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Don’t be too sure. Just because I wear a
uniform – that doesn’t make me a Girl Scout.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Miss Kubelik, one doesn’t get to be a second
administrative assistant around here unless he’s a pretty good judge of
character – and as far as I’m concerned, you’re tops. I mean,
decency-wise – and otherwise-wise. Cheers.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Cheers.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: One more?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: I shouldn’t drink when I’m driving.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: You’re so right.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: By the power vested in me, I herewith declare
this elevator out of order. Shall we join the natives?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Why not? They seem friendly enough.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Don’t you believe it. Later on there will be
human sacrifices – white collar workers tossed into the computing
machines, and punched full of those little square holes.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: How many of those drinks did you have?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Three.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: I thought so.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: You wait here. I think I hear the sound of
running water.</p>
<p><strong>miss olsen</strong>: Hi. How’s the branch manager from Kansas
City?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: I beg your pardon?</p>
<p><strong>miss olsen</strong>: I’m Miss Olsen – Mr. Sheldrake’s
secretary.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Yes, I know.</p>
<p><strong>miss olsen</strong>: So you don’t have to play innocent with
me. He used to tell his wife that I was the branch manager from Seattle
– four years ago when we were having a little ring-a-ding- ding.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: I don’t know what you’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>miss olsen</strong>: And before me there was Miss Rossi in
Auditing – and after me there was Miss Koch in Disability – and just
before you there was Miss What’s-Her-Name, on the twenty- fifth floor
–</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Will you excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>miss olsen</strong>: What for? You haven’t done anything –
it’s him – what a salesman – always the last booth in the Chinese
restaurant – and the same pitch about divorcing his wife – and in the
end you wind up with egg foo yong on your face.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Miss Kubelik.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Well – thank you.</p>
<p><strong>miss olsen</strong>: Always happy to do something for our
girls in uniform.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: You all right? What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Nothing. There are just too many people
here.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Why don’t we step into any office? There’s
something I want your advice about, anyway. I have my own office now,
naturally. And you may be interested to know I’m the second youngest
executive in the company – the only one younger is a grandson of the
chairman of the board.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Miss Kubelik, I would like your honest opinion.
I’ve had this in my desk for a week – cost me fifteen dollars – but I
just couldn’t get up enough nerve to wear it –</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: It’s what they call the junior executive model.
What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Guess I made a boo-boo, huh?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: No – I like it.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Really? You mean you wouldn’t be ashamed to be
seen with somebody in a hat like this?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Of course not.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Maybe if I wore it a little more to the side –
is that better?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Much better.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Well, as long as you wouldn’t be ashamed to be
seen with me – how about the three of us going out this evening – you
and me and the bowler – stroll down Fifth Avenue – sort of break it in
–</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: This is a bad day for me.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I understand. Christmas – family and all that
–</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: I’d better get back to my elevator. I don’t
want to be fired.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Oh, you don’t have to worry about that. I have
quite a bit of influence in Personnel. You know Mr. Sheldrake?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: He and I are like this. Sent me a Christmas
card. See?</p>
<p><strong>season’s greetings</strong>: from the SHELDRAKES</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Makes a cute picture.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I thought maybe I could put in a word for you
with Mr. Sheldrake – get you a little promotion – how would you like to
be an elevator starter?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: I’m afraid there are too many other girls
around here with seniority over me.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: No problem. Why don’t we discuss it sometime
over the holidays – I could call you and pick you up and we’ll have the
big unveiling – – you sure this is the right way to wear it?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: I think so.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: You don’t think it’s tilted a little too much
–</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: After all, this is a conservative firm – I
don’t want people to think I’m an entertainer –</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: The mirror – it’s broken.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: I know. I like it this way – makes me look the
way I feel.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Your phone.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Oh. Yes? Just a minute. If you don’t mind –
this is sort of personal</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: All right. Have a nice Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Yes, Mr. Sheldrake – no, I didn’t forget – the
tree is up and the Tom and Jerry mix is in the refrigerator – yes, sir –
same to you.</p>
<p><strong>kirkeby</strong>: Where you going, Buddy-boy? The party’s
just starting. Listen, kid – give me a break, will you – how about
tomorrow afternoon? I can’t take her to that drive-in again – the car
doesn’t even have a heater four o’clock – okay?</p>
<p><strong>santa claus</strong>: Hey, Charlie – give me a shot of
bourbon – and step on it – my sleigh is double parked.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: You buy me a drink, I’ll buy you some music.
Rum Collins.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Rum Collins. And another one of these little
mothers.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: You like Castro? I mean – how do you feel
about Castro?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: What is Castro?</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: You know, that big-shot down in Cuba with
the crazy beard.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: What about him?</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: Because as far as I’m concerned, he’s a no
good fink. Two weeks ago I wrote him a letter – never even answered
me.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: That so.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: All I wanted him to do was let Mickey out
for Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Who is Mickey?</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: My husband. He’s in Havana – in jail.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Oh. Mixed up in that revolution?</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: Mickey? He wouldn’t do nothing like that.
He’s a jockey. They caught him doping a horse.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Well, you can’t win ’em all.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: ’Twas the night before Christmas And all
through the house Not a creature was stirring – Nothing – No action –
Dullsville! You married?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: Family?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: A night like this, it sort of spooks you to
walk into an empty apartment.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I said I had no family – I didn’t say I had an
empty apartment.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Come on, Fran – don’t be like that. You
just going to sit there and keep bawling? You won’t talk to me, you
won’t tell me what’s wrong – Look, I know you think I’m stalling you.
But when you’ve been married to a woman for twelve years, you don’t just
sit down at the breakfast table and say “Pass the sugar – and I want a
divorce.” It’s not that easy. Anyway, this is the wrong time. The kids
are home from school – my in- laws are visiting for the holidays – I
can’t bring it up now. This isn’t like you, Fran – you were always such
a good sport – such fun to be with –</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Yeah – that’s me. The Happy Idiot – a million
laughs.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Well, that’s more like it. At least
you’re speaking to me.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Funny thing happened to me at the office party
today – I ran into your secretary – Miss Olsen. You know –
ring-a-ding-ding? I laughed so much I like to died.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Is that what’s been bothering you – Miss
Olsen? That’s ancient history.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: I was never very good at history. Let me see –
there was Miss Olsen, and then there was Miss Rossi – no, she came
before – it was Miss Koch who came after Miss Olsen –</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Now, Fran –</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: And just think – right now there’s some lucky
girl in the building who’s going to come after me –</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Okay, okay, Fran. I deserve that. But
just ask yourself – why does a man run around with a lot of girls?
Because he’s unhappy at home – because he’s lonely, that’s why – all
that was before you, Fran – I’ve stopped running.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: How could I be so stupid? You’d think I would
have learned by now – when you’re in love with a married man, you
shouldn’t wear mascara.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: It’s Christmas Eve, Fran – let’s not
fight.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Merry Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Oh. Our friend from the Chinese
restaurant. Thanks, Fran. We better keep it here.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Yeah, we better.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: I have a present for you. I didn’t quite
know what to get you – anyway it’s a little awkward for me, shopping – –
so here’s a hundred dollars – go out and buy yourself something.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: They have some nice alligator bags at
Bergdorf’s –</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Fran, it’s a quarter to seven – and I
mustn’t miss the train – if we hadn’t wasted all that time – I have to
get home and trim the tree –</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Okay. I just thought as long as it was paid
for –</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Don’t ever talk like that, Fran! Don’t
make yourself out to be cheap.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: A hundred dollars? I wouldn’t call that cheap.
And you must be paying somebody something for the use of the apartment
–</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Stop that, Fran.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: You’ll miss your train, Jeff.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Coming?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: You run along – I want to fix my face.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Don’t forget to kill the lights. See you
Monday.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Sure. Monday and Thursday – and Monday again –
and Thursday again –</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: It won’t always be like this. I love you,
Fran.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Careful – lipstick.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Drink up, Pop. It’s closing time.</p>
<p><strong>santa claus</strong>: But it’s early, Charlie.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Don’t you know what night this is?</p>
<p><strong>santa claus</strong>: I know, Charlie. I know. I work for the
outfit.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Hey, knock it off, will you? Go home.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: O-U-T – out!</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: Where do we go – my place or yours?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Might as well go to mine – everybody else
does.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: Poor Mickey – when I think of him all by
himself in that jail in Havana – – want to see his picture?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Not particularly.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: He’s so cute – five-foot-two – ninety-nine
pounds…like a little chihuahua.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: Can I ask you a personal question?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: You got a girl-friend?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: She may be a girl – but she’s no friend of
mine.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: Still stuck on her, huh.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Stuck on her! Obviously, you don’t know me very
well.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: I don’t know you at all.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Permit me – C.C. Baxter – junior executive,
Arthur Murray graduate, lover.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: I’m Mrs. MacDougall – Margie to you.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: This way, Mrs. MacDougall.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: Say, this is Snugsville.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Mrs. MacDougall, I think it is only fair to
warn you that you are now alone with a notorious sexpot.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: No kidding.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Ask anybody around here. As a matter of fact,
when it’s time for me to go – and I may go just like that – – I have
promised my body to the Columbia Medical Center.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: Gee. Sort of gives you goose-bumps just to
think about it.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Well, they haven’t got me yet, baby. Dig up
some ice from the kitchen and let’s not waste any time –
preliminary-wise.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: I’m with you, lover.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: All right, Miss Kubelik – get up. It’s past
checking-out time, and the hotel management would appreciate it if you
would get the hell out of here. Look, Miss Kubelik, I used to like you –
I used to like you a lot – but it’s all over between us – so beat it –
O-U-T – out! Come on – wake up!</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Oh, my God.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Miss Kubelik! Miss Kubelik!</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: I broke a nail trying to get the ice-tray
out. You ought to buy yourself a new refrigerator.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: I didn’t mean right now.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Dr. Dreyfuss! Hey, Doc!</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: There’s a girl in my place – she took some
sleeping pills – you better come quick – I can’t wake her up.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfuss</strong>: Let me get my bag.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Hurry up, Doc.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: Hey – over here, lover.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: What’s all this running around? You’re going
to wear yourself out.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: Not so rough, honey.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: Good night?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: The party’s over.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: What’s the matter? Did I do something
wrong?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: It’s an emergency – see you some other
time.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Not this one – – in there, Doc.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: Say, what’s going on here, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Nothing. Just clear out, will you?</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: My shoes.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: Some lover you are. Some sexpot!</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Here – find yourself a phone booth and call
your husband in Havana.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: You bet I will. And when I tell him how you
treated me, he’ll push your face in. You fink!</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: She going to be all right, Doc?</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfuss</strong>: How many pills were in that
bottle?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: It was half-full – about a dozen or so. You
going to have to take her to the hospital?</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfuss</strong>: Help me, will you?</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfuss</strong>: Into the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: What are you going to do, Doc?</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfuss</strong>: Get that stuff out of her stomach – if
it isn’t too late. You better put some coffee on – and pray.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfuss</strong>: Bring my bag.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfuss</strong>: Roll up her right sleeve.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfuss</strong>: Nice veins.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfuss</strong>: Want to tell me what happened?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I don’t know – I mean – I wasn’t here – you see
– we had some words earlier – nothing serious, really – what you might
call a lovers’ quarrel –</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfuss</strong>: So you went right out and picked
yourself up another dame.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Something like that.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfuss</strong>: You know, Baxter, you’re a real
cutie-pie – yes, you are.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfuss</strong>: If you’d come home half an hour later,
you would have had quite a Christmas present.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfuss</strong>: Get the coffee.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfuss</strong>: Let’s get some air in here. Open the
windows.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfuss</strong>: What’s her name?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Miss Kubelik – Fran.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfuss</strong>: Fran, I’m a doctor. I’m here because
you took too many sleeping pills. Do you understand what I’m saying?
Fran, I’m Dr. Dreyfuss – I’m here to help you. You took all those
sleeping pills – remember?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Sleeping pills.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfuss</strong>: That’s right, Fran. And I’m a
doctor.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfuss</strong>: Dr. Dreyfuss.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Dreyfuss.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfuss</strong>: Get more coffee.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfuss</strong>: Tell me again – what’s my name?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Dr. Dreyfuss.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfuss</strong>: And what happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: I took sleeping pills.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfuss</strong>: Do you know where you are, Fran?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfuss</strong>: Yes, you do. Now concentrate.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfuss</strong>: Do you know who this is? Look at
him.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Mr. Baxter – nineteenth floor.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Hello, Miss Kubelik.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfuss</strong>: Mister – Miss – such politeness!</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Well – we work in the same building – and we
try to keep it quiet –</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Don’t you remember? We were at the office party
together –</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Oh, yes – office party – Miss Olsen –</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: That’s right. I told you we had a fight –
that’s what it was about – Miss Olsen – you know that other girl you saw
–</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: I don’t understand –</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: It’s not important, Fran – the main thing is
that I got here in time – and you’re going to be all right – – isn’t
she, Doc?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: I’m so tired –</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfuss</strong>: Here – drink this.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Please – just let me sleep.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfuss</strong>: You can’t sleep. Come on, Fran – open
your eyes. Let’s get her walking. We’ve got to keep her awake for the
next couple of hours.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfuss</strong>: Now walk, Fran. One, two, three, four
– one, two, three, four – that’s the idea – left, right, left, right –
now we turn – one, two, three, four –</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfuss</strong>: Left, right, left, right – walk, walk,
walk – one, two, three, four – turn – left, right, left, right – now you
got it –</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfuss</strong>: She’ll sleep on and off for the next
twenty-four hours. Of course, she’ll have a dandy hangover when she
wakes up –</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Just as long as she’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfuss</strong>: These cases are harder on the doctor
than on the patient. I ought to charge you by the mile.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfuss</strong>: Any of that coffee left?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfuss</strong>: How do you spell her last name?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Kubelik – with two k’s.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfuss</strong>: What’s her address? Where does she
live?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Why do you want to know, Doc? You don’t have to
report this, do you?</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfuss</strong>: It’s regulations.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: She didn’t mean it, Doc – it was an accident –
she had a little too much to drink and – she didn’t know what she was
doing – there was no suicide note or anything – believe me, Doc, I’m not
thinking about myself –</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfuss</strong>: Aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: It’s just that she’s got a family – and there’s
the people in the office – look, Doc, can’t you forget you’re a doctor –
let’s just say you’re here as a neighbor –</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfuss</strong>: Well, as a doctor, I guess I can’t
prove it wasn’t an accident. But as your neighbor, I’d like to kick your
keester clear around the block. Mind if I cool this off?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Help yourself.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfuss</strong>: I don’t know what you did to that girl
in there – and don’t tell me – but it was bound to happen, the way you
carry on. Live now, pay later. Diner’s Club! Why don’t you grow up,
Baxter? Be a mensch! You know what that means?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I’m not sure.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfuss</strong>: A mansch – a human being! So you got
off easy this time – so you were lucky –</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Yeah, wasn’t I?</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfuss</strong>: But you’re not out of the woods yet,
Baxter – because most of them try it again! You know where I am if you
need me.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lieberman</strong>: Mr. Baxter. Open up already!</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Oh – Mrs. Lieberman.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lieberman</strong>: So who did you think it was – Kris
Kringle? What was going on here last night?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Last night?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lieberman</strong>: All that marching – tramp, tramp,
tramp – you were having army maneuvers maybe?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I’m sorry, Mrs. Lieberman – and I’ll never
invite those people again.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lieberman</strong>: What you get from renting to
bachelors. All night I didn’t sleep ten minutes – and I’m sure you woke
up Dr. Dreyfuss.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Don’t worry about Dr. Dreyfuss – I happen to
know he was out on a case.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lieberman</strong>: I’m warning you, Mr. Baxter – this
is a respectable house, not a honky-tonky. Come on, Oscar.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Operator, I want White Plains, New York –
Mr. J. D. Sheldrake – – make it person to person.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: 7-6-5-4-3-2-1 – let her rip!</p>
<p><strong>jeff jr.</strong>: I’ll get it.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Hey, Dad – why don’t we put a fly in the nose
cone and see if we can bring it back alive?</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: It’s a thought.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Maybe we should send up two flies – and see
if they’ll propagate in orbit.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: See if they’ll what?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Propagate – you know, multiply – baby
flies?</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Oh – oh!</p>
<p><strong>jeff jr.</strong>: It’s for you, Dad. A Mr. Baxter.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Baxter?</p>
<p><strong>jeff jr.</strong>: Person to person.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Come on – help me round up some flies.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Hello? – yes – what’s on your mind,
Baxter?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I hate to disturb you, but something came up –
it’s rather important – and I think it would be a good idea if you could
see me – at the apartment – as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: You’re not making sense, Baxter. What’s
this all about?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I didn’t want to tell you over the phone but
that certain party – you know who I mean – I found her here last night –
she had taken an overdose of sleeping pills.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. sheldrake’s voice</strong>: What is it, Jeff? Who’s on
the phone?</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: One of our employees had an accident – I
don’t know why they bother me with these things on Christmas Day. Yes,
Baxter – just how serious is it?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Well, it was touch and go there for a while –
but she’s sleeping it off now.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I thought maybe you’d like to be here when she
wakes up.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: That’s impossible. You’ll have to handle
this situation yourself – as a matter of fact, I’m counting on you –</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Yes, sir – I understand. She left a note – you
want me to open it and read it to you? Well, it was just a suggestion –
no, you don’t have to worry about that, Mr. Sheldrake – I kept your name
out of it so there’ll be no trouble, police-wise or newspaper- wise
–</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: – you see, the doctor, he’s a friend of mine –
we were very lucky in that respect – actually, he thinks she’s my girl –
no, he just jumped to the conclusion – around here, I’m known as quite a
ladies’ man –</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: – of course, we’re not out of the woods yet –
sometimes they try it again – yes sir, I’ll do my best – it looks like
it’ll be a couple of days before she’s fully recovered, and I may have a
little problem with the landlady –</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: – all right, Mr. Sheldrake, I’ll keep her in my
apartment as long as I can – any sort of message you want me to give
her? – well, I’ll think of something – goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: I’m sorry, Mr. Baxter.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Miss Kubelik – – you shouldn’t be out of
bed.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: I didn’t know – I had no idea this was your
apartment –</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Let me help you.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: I’m so ashamed. Why didn’t you just let me
die?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: What kind of talk is that? So you got a little
over- emotional – but you’re fine now.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: My head – it feels like a big wad of chewing
gum. What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Two o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Where’s my dress? I have to go home.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: You’re in no condition to go anywhere – except
back to bed.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: You don’t want me here –</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Sure I do. It’s always nice to have company for
Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Miss Kubelik, I’m stronger than you are –</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: I just want to go brush my teeth –</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Oh – of course. I think there’s a new
toothbrush somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Here – put this on.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Here. How about some breakfast?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: No – I don’t want anything.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I’ll fix you some coffee.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Oh – we’re all out of coffee – you had quite a
lot of it last night –</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Mrs. Dreyfuss, can I borrow some coffee – and
maybe an orange and a couple of eggs?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dreyfuss</strong>: Eggs he asks me for. Oranges. What
you need is a good horse-whipping.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Ma’am?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dreyfuss</strong>: From me the doctor has no secrets.
Poor girl – how could you do a thing like that?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I didn’t really do anything – honest – I mean,
you take a girl out a couple of times a week – just for laughs – and
right away she thinks you’re serious – marriage-wise.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dreyfuss</strong>: Big shot! For you, I wouldn’t lift a
finger – but for her, I’ll fix a little something to eat.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Who are you calling, Miss Kubelik?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: My sister – she’ll want to know what happened
to me.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Wait a minute – let’s talk this over first.
Just what are you going to tell her?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Well, I haven’t figured it out, exactly.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: You better figure it out – exactly. Suppose she
asks you why you didn’t come home last night?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: I’ll tell her I spent the night with a
friend.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Someone from the office.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: And where are you now?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: In his apartment.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: His apartment?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: I mean – her apartment.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: What’s your friend’s name?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Baxter.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: What’s her first name?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Miss.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: When are you coming home?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: As soon as I can walk.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Something wrong with your legs?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: No – it’s my stomach.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Your stomach?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: They had to pump it out.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Miss Kubelik, I don’t think you ought to call
anybody – not till that chewing gum is out of your head.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: But they’ll be worried about me – my
brother-in-law may be calling the police –</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: That’s why we have to be careful – we don’t
want to involve anybody – after all, Mr. Sheldrake is a married man
–</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Thanks for reminding me.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I didn’t mean it that way – I was just talking
to him on the phone – he’s very concerned about you.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: He doesn’t give a damn about me.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Oh, you’re wrong. He told me –</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: He’s a liar. But that’s not the worst part of
it – the worst part is – I still love him.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Must be Mrs. Dreyfuss – – remember the doctor –
from last night – that’s his wife.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dreyfuss</strong>: So where is the victim? Max the
Knife!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dreyfuss</strong>: Nu, little lady, how are we feeling
today?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: I don’t know – kind of dizzy.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dreyfuss</strong>: Here. The best thing for dizzy is a
little noodle soup with chicken – white meat – and a glass tea.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Thank you. I’m really not hungry.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dreyfuss</strong>: Go ahead! Eat! Enjoy!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dreyfuss</strong>: You wouldn’t have such a thing as a
napkin, would you?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Well, I have some paper towels –</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dreyfuss</strong>: Beatnik! Go to my kitchen – third
drawer, under the good silver, there is napkins.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Yes, Mrs. Dreyfuss.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dreyfuss</strong>: So what are you waiting for – a
singing commercial?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: I can’t eat.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dreyfuss</strong>: You must eat – and you must get
healthy – and you must forget him. Such a fine boy he seemed when he
first moved in here – clean and cut – a regular Ivy Leaguer. Turns out
he is King Farouk. Mit the drinking – mit the cha cha – mit the no
napkins. A girl like you, for the rest of your life you want to cry in
your noodle soup? Who needs it! You listen to me, you find yourself a
nice, substantial man – a widower maybe – and settle down – instead of
nashing all those sleeping pills – for what, for whom? – for some Good
Time Charlie? Sssh!</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: One napkin, coming up. I wish we had some
champagne to wrap it around.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dreyfuss</strong>: What did I tell you?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Look, Mrs. Dreyfuss, you don’t have to wait
around. I’ll wash the dishes and –</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dreyfuss</strong>: You wash ’em, you break ’em. I’ll
come back for them later. If he makes trouble, give me a yell.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: She doesn’t seem to like you very much.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Oh, I don’t mind. As a matter of fact, I’m sort
of flattered – that anybody should think a girl like you – would do a
thing like this – over a guy like me.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Oh. Did you find something here – an envelope
– ?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Yes, I’ve got it. Don’t you think we’d better
destroy it? So it won’t fall into the wrong hands – ?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Open it.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: There’s nothing here but a hundred dollar
bill.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: That’s right. Will you see that Mr. Sheldrake
gets it?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Here – take this, will you?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: You want me to move the television set in here?
You play gin rummy?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: I’m not very good at it.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I am. Let me get the cards.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: You don’t have to entertain me.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Nothing I’d like better – you know
togetherness. Guess what I did last Christmas. Had an early dinner at
the automat, then went to the zoo, then I came home and cleaned up after
Mr. Eichelberger – he had a little eggnog party here. I’m way ahead this
year.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Three across, spades double, high deals. Eight
– ten.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: I think I’m going to give it all up.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Give what up?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Why do people have to love people, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Yeah – I know what you mean. Queen.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: I don’t want it.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Pick a card.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: What do you call it when somebody keeps
getting smashed up in automobile accidents?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: A bad insurance risk?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: That’s me with men. I’ve been jinxed from the
word go – first time I was ever kissed was in a cemetery.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: A cemetery?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: I was fifteen – we used to go there to smoke.
His name was George – he threw me over for a drum majorette.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Gin.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Thirty-six and twenty-five – that’s sixty-one
and two boxes.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: I just have this talent for falling in love
with the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: How many guys were there?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Three. The last one was manager of a finance
company, back home in Pittsburgh – they found a little shortage in his
accounts, but he asked me to wait for him – he’ll be out in 1965.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Cut.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: So I came to New York and moved in with my
sister and her husband – he drives a cab. They sent me to secretarial
school, and I applied for a job with Consolidated - but I flunked the
typing test –</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Too slow?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Oh. I can type up a storm, but I can’t spell.
So they gave me a pair of white gloves and stuck me in an elevator –
that’s how I met Jeff – Oh, God, I’m so fouled up. What am I going to do
now?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: You better win a hand – you’re on a blitz.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Was he really upset when you told him?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Mr. Sheldrake? Oh, yes. Very.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Maybe he does love me – only he doesn’t have
the nerve to tell his wife.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I’m sure that’s the explanation.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: You really think so?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: No doubt about it.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Can I have that pad and the pencil?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: I’m going to write a letter to
Mrs. Sheldrake.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: You are?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: As one woman to another – I’m sure she’ll
understand –</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Miss Kubelik, I don’t think that’s such a good
idea.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Well, for one thing, you can’t spell. And
secondly – if you did something like that – you’d hate yourself.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: I don’t like myself very much anyway.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Pick up your cards and let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Do I have to?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: You bet. I got a terrific hand.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: You sure you want to throw that card?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Gin.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Fifty-two and twenty-five – that’s
seventy-seven – spades is double – a hundred and fifty-four – and four
boxes – you’re blitzed in two games.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: All right – all right, Mrs. Dreyfuss.</p>
<p><strong>kirkeby</strong>: Hi, Baxter.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>kirkeby</strong>: What do I – ? Just a minute.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: You can’t come in.</p>
<p><strong>kirkeby</strong>: What’s the matter with you, Buddy- boy? I
made a reservation for four o’clock, remember?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Look, you can’t stay here. Just take your
champagne and go.</p>
<p><strong>kirkeby</strong>: Baxter, I don’t want to pull rank on you –
but I told the lady it was all set – you want to make a liar out of
me?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Are you going to leave, Mr. Kirkeby, or do I
have to throw you out?</p>
<p><strong>kirkeby</strong>: Buddy-boy, why didn’t you say so? You got
yourself a little playmate, huh?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Now will you get out?</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: Hey, come on, what are we waiting for? Open
up, will you?</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfuss</strong>: Mildred – !</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: What’s holding things up?</p>
<p><strong>kirkeby</strong>: Say, why don’t we have ourselves a party –
the four of us?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>kirkeby</strong>: Well, I don’t blame you. So you hit the
jackpot, eh kid – I mean, Kubelik-wise? Don’t worry. I won’t say a word
to anybody.</p>
<p><strong>kirkeby</strong>: Stay with it, Buddy-boy! Come on,
Sylvia.</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: What gives?</p>
<p><strong>kirkeby</strong>: A little mixup in signals. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: Go where?</p>
<p><strong>kirkeby</strong>: What’s your mother doing this
afternoon?</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: She’s home – stuffing a turkey.</p>
<p><strong>kirkeby</strong>: Why don’t we send her to a movie – like
Ben-Hur?</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: That’s fine. But what are we going to do
about grandma and Uncle Herman and Aunt Sophie and my two nieces –</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Who was that?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Just somebody delivering a bottle of champagne.
Like some?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Would you mind opening the window?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Now don’t go getting any ideas, Miss
Kubelik.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: I just want some fresh air.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: It’s only one story down – the best you can do
is break a leg.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: So they’ll shoot me – like a horse.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Please, Miss Kubelik, you got to promise me you
won’t do anything foolish.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Who’d care?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I would.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Why can’t I ever fall in love with somebody
nice like you?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Yeah. Well – that’s the way it crumbles,
cookie-wise. Go to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>secretaries</strong>: Good morning, Mr. Sheldrake.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Miss Olsen, will you come into my office,
please?</p>
<p><strong>miss olsen</strong>: Did you have a nice Christmas?</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Lovely. You were a big help.</p>
<p><strong>miss olsen</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Thank you for giving that little pep talk
to Miss Kubelik at the office party.</p>
<p><strong>miss olsen</strong>: I’m sorry, Jeff. You know I could never
hold my liquor –</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: But I thought you could hold your
tongue.</p>
<p><strong>miss olsen</strong>: It won’t happen again.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: You bet it won’t. I’ll arrange for you to
get a month’s severance pay – That’s right, Miss Olsen. I’m letting you
go.</p>
<p><strong>miss olsen</strong>: You let me go four years ago, Jeff. Only
you were cruel enough to make me sit out there and watch the new models
pass by.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: I’d appreciate it if you’d be out of here
as soon as you can.</p>
<p><strong>miss olsen</strong>: Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: This is Mr. Sheldrake. I’d like
Mr. Baxter’s home telephone number – that’s C.C. Baxter, in Ordinary
Premium Accounting –</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Hello, Baxter? Jeff Sheldrake. Can you
talk?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Yes, she’s in the shower – she’s coming along
fine, considering.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Good. Is there anything you need – money
– ?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: No, thank you, Mr. Sheldrake. As a matter of
fact, I’ve got some money for you – a hundred dollars –</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Oh. Well, if there’s anything I can do
for you –</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: For me? I don’t think so. But I was hoping
maybe you could do something for her –</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Like what? Put yourself in my place,
Baxter – how can I help her – my hands are tied –</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Well, at least you can talk to her – let me put
her on – and please be gentle –</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: There’s a call for you –</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: For me?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: – Mr. Sheldrake.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: I don’t want to talk to him.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I think you should. I have to run down to the
grocery anyway – all that’s left around here is one frozen pizza – I’ll
be right back – okay?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Hello, Jeff. Yes, I’m all right.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Fran, why did you do it? It’s so childish
– and it never solves anything – I ought to be very angry with you,
scaring me like that – but let’s forget the whole thing – pretend it
never happened – what do you say, Fran? Fran –</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Are you there, Fran?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Of course I’m not here – because the whole
thing never happened – I never took those pills – I never loved you – we
never even met – isn’t that the way you want it?</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: There you go again – you know I didn’t
mean it that way, Fran. Just get well – do what the nurse tells you – I
mean Baxter – and I’ll see you as soon as I can. Bye, Fran.</p>
<p><strong>miss olsen</strong>: Hello, Mrs. Sheldrake? This is Miss
Olsen – fine, thank you – Mrs. Sheldrake, I was wondering if we could
have lunch together? – well, I don’t know how important it is, but I
think you might find it educational – it concerns your husband – all
right, one o’clock, at Longchamp’s, Madison and 59th.</p>
<p><strong>miss olsen</strong>: Don’t worry, I’m on my way. I was just
making a personal call.</p>
<p><strong>miss olsen</strong>: Here’s a dime.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lieberman</strong>: Oh, Mr. Baxter – I’m glad you’re
here – I was just going to get the passkey.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lieberman</strong>: I thought I smelled gas coming from
your apartment.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Gas?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Miss Kubelik!</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Miss Kubelik!</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Sure. What’s that funny smell?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Gas. Didn’t you turn it on?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Yes. I was boiling some water to get the
coffee stains out of my dress.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: You turned it on – but you didn’t light it.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Are you supposed to?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: In this house, you’re supposed to.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: What are you doing with that?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: I was washing my stockings, so I decided I
might as well do your socks.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: It’s very curious – I could only find three
and a half pair.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Well, things are a little disorganized around
here.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: I’d say. What’s a tennis racquet doing in the
kitchen?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Tennis racquet? Oh, I remember – I was cooking
myself an Italian dinner. I used it to strain the spaghetti.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: As a matter of fact, I’m a pretty good cook –
but I’m a lousy housekeeper.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Yes, you are, When I was straightening up the
couch, you know what I found? Six hairpins, a lipstick, a pair of false
eyelashes, and a swizzle stick from the Stork Club.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: It’s just that I’m the kind of guy who can’t
say no – I don’t mean to girls – I mean –</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: You mean to someone like Mr. Sheldrake.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I guess so.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: I know so. He’s a taker.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: A what?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Some people take, some people get took – and
they know they’re getting took – and there’s nothing they can do about
it.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I wouldn’t say that – What would you like to
have for diner? There’s onion soup and canned asparagus –</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: I really ought to be getting home. My family
will be flipping by now.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: You can’t leave yet. The doctor says it takes
forty-eight hours to get the stuff out of your system.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: I wonder how long it takes to get someone
you’re stuck on out of your system? If they’d only invent some kind of a
pump for that –</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I know how you feel, Miss Kubelik. You think
it’s the end of the world – but it’s not, really. I went through exactly
the same thing myself.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: You did?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Well, maybe not exactly – I tried to do it with
a gun.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Over a girl?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Worse than that – she was the wife of my best
friend – and I was mad for her. But I knew it was hopeless – so I
decided to end it all. I went to a pawnshop and bought a forty-five
automatic and drove up to Eden Park – do you know Cincinnati?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: No, I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Anyway, I parked the car and loaded the gun –
well, you read in the papers all the time that people shoot themselves,
but believe me, it’s not that easy – I mean, how do you do it? – here,
or here, or here – – you know where I finally shot myself?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: In the knee?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Uh-huh. While I was sitting there, trying to
make my mind up, a cop stuck his head in the car, because I was
illegally parked – so I started to hide the gun under the seat and it
went off – pow!</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: That’s terrible.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Yeah. Took me a year before I could bend my
knee – but I got over the girl in three weeks. She still lives in
Cincinnati, has four kids, gained twenty pounds – she sends me a fruit
cake every Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Are you just making that up to make me feel
better?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Of course not. Here’s the fruit cake. And you
want to see my knee?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: No, thanks. The fellows in the office may get
the wrong idea how I found out.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: So let ’em. Look, I’m going to cook dinner for
us. We’ll have the fruit cake for dessert. You just sit there and rest.
You’ve done enough for one day.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Yes, nurse.</p>
<p><strong>elevator starter</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>matuschka</strong>: I’m looking for one of the elevator girls
– Miss Kubelik.</p>
<p><strong>elevator starter</strong>: So am I. She didn’t report this
morning.</p>
<p><strong>matuschka</strong>: She didn’t. Where can I get some
information – who’s in charge here?</p>
<p><strong>elevator starter</strong>: That comes under General Office
Administration. See Mr. Dobisch, twenty-first floor.</p>
<p><strong>matuschka</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>kirkeby</strong>: – so yesterday afternoon I take Sylvia up
to the apartment, and guess who he’s got stashed away in the
bedroom?</p>
<p><strong>dobisch</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>kirkeby</strong>: Kubelik.</p>
<p><strong>dobisch</strong>: No kidding. Buddy-boy and Kubelik having
themselves a little toot!</p>
<p><strong>kirkeby</strong>: Toot? It’s more like a lost weekend.
Neither of them showed up for work today.</p>
<p><strong>kirkeby</strong>: What gripes me is the two of them were
guzzling my champagne while Sylvia and I wound up at the Guggenheim
Museum.</p>
<p><strong>matuschka</strong>: Mr. Dobisch?</p>
<p><strong>dobisch</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>matuschka</strong>: My name is Karl Matuschka – my
sister-in-law, she runs one of the elevators here – Fran Kubelik.</p>
<p><strong>kirkeby</strong>: Miss Kubelik?</p>
<p><strong>matuschka</strong>: You know her?</p>
<p><strong>dobisch</strong>: Of course. There may be a lot of employees
here – but we’re one big happy family.</p>
<p><strong>matuschka</strong>: Well, she lives with us – and my wife,
she’s getting a little nervous – on account of Fran hasn’t been home for
two days.</p>
<p><strong>kirkeby</strong>: That so.</p>
<p><strong>matuschka</strong>: Anyway, we was wondering if somebody in
the office would know what happened to her.</p>
<p><strong>dobisch</strong>: I see. What do you think, Al? Can we help
the man?</p>
<p><strong>kirkeby</strong>: Why not? We don’t owe Buddy-boy
anything.</p>
<p><strong>dobisch</strong>: Yeah. What’s Buddy-boy done for us
lately?</p>
<p><strong>matuschka</strong>: Who is Buddy-boy?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Are we dressing for dinner?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: No – just come as you are.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Say, you’re pretty good with that racquet.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: You ought to see my backhand. And wait till I
serve the meatballs.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Shall I light the candles?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: It’s a must – gracious-living-wise.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: I see you bought some napkins.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Might as well go all the way.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: You know, I used to live like Robinson Crusoe –
shipwrecked among eight million people. Then one day I saw a footprint
in the sand – and there you were – It’s a wonderful thing – dinner for
two.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: You usually eat alone?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Oh, no. Sometimes I have dinner with Ed
Sullivan, sometimes with Dinah Shore or Perry Como – the other night I
had dinner with Mae West – of course, she was much younger then.
Cheers.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Cheers.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: You know what we’re going to do after
dinner?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: The dishes?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I mean, after that?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: You don’t have to if you don’t want to –</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: I don’t?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: We’re going to finish that gin game.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: So I want you to keep a clear head.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Because I don’t want to take advantage of you –
the way I did yesterday in bed.</p>
<p><strong>matuschka</strong>: Baxter?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>matuschka</strong>: What’s with you, Fran – did you forget
where you live?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: This is my brother-in-law, Karl Matuschka.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: How do you do, Mr. Matuschka?</p>
<p><strong>matuschka</strong>: Okay, get your clothes on. I got the cab
downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Now, wait a minute. I know what you’re thinking
– but it’s not as bad as it looks –</p>
<p><strong>matuschka</strong>: It’s none of my business what you do,
Fran – you’re over twenty- one – but your sister happens to think you’re
a lady.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: All we were going to do is eat and wash the
dishes –</p>
<p><strong>matuschka</strong>: Look, Buddy-boy – if there wasn’t a lady
present, I’d clobber you.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: All right, Karl – I’ll get dressed.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Care for a martini? Champagne? How about a
little spaghetti with meat sauce? Made it myself. Your sister-in-law
sure is terrific – Must be murder driving a cab in New York – I mean,
with all that cross-town traffic –</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfuss</strong>: Hi, Baxter.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfuss</strong>: How’s the patient?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Oh, I’m fine, Doc.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfuss</strong>: Not you – Miss Kubelik.</p>
<p><strong>matuschka</strong>: What’s the matter with Miss Kubelik?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Oh, this is Mr. Matuschka – he’s Miss Kubelik’s
– he’s got a cab downstairs –</p>
<p><strong>matuschka</strong>: Fran been sick or something?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: No, no – just had a little accident.</p>
<p><strong>matuschka</strong>: What does he mean, accident?</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfuss</strong>: Well, these things happen all the time
–</p>
<p><strong>matuschka</strong>: What things? Say, what kind of doctor are
you, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Oh, not that kind. He just gave her a shot and
pumped her stomach out –</p>
<p><strong>matuschka</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Because I took some sleeping pills. But I’m
all right now – so let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>matuschka</strong>: Why did you take sleeping pills?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: On account of me.</p>
<p><strong>matuschka</strong>: You?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Who else?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Leave him alone, Karl.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: You fool – you damn fool.</p>
<p><strong>matuschka</strong>: Come on, Fran.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Goodbye, Mr. Baxter.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Goodbye, doctor.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfuss</strong>: I don’t want to gloat, but just
between us, you had that coming to you. Tch, tch, tch. Are you going to
have a shiner tomorrow. Let me get my bag.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Don’t bother, Doc. It doesn’t hurt a bit.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Mr. Sheldrake’s office? This is C.C. Baxter.
Would you please tell Mr. Sheldrake I’d like to come up and see him?
It’s rather important. Will you call me back, please?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Mr. Sheldrake, I’ve got good news for you. All
your troubles are over. I’m going to take Miss Kubelik off your hands.
The plain fact is, Mr. Sheldrake, that I love her. I haven’t told her
yet, but I thought you should be the first to know. After all, you don’t
really want her, and I do, and although it may sound presumptuous, she
needs somebody like me. So I think it would be the thing all around – –
solution-wise. Yes? I’ll be right up.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Mr. Sheldrake, I’ve got good news for you –</p>
<p><strong>kirkeby</strong>: Hi, Buddy-boy. What happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>dobisch</strong>: Hit by a swinging door? Or maybe a Yellow
Cab?</p>
<p><strong>kirkeby</strong>: That guy really must’ve belted him.</p>
<p><strong>dobisch</strong>: Yeah, he’s punchy. Talking to himself.</p>
<p><strong>elevator operator</strong>: Twenty-seven.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: You see, Mr. Sheldrake, those two days she
spent in the apartment – it made me realize how lonely I’d been before.
But thanks to you, I’m in a financial position to marry her – if I can
ever square things with her family.</p>
<p><strong>secretary’s voice</strong>: Mr. Baxter is here.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Send him in.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Mr. Sheldrake, I’ve got good news for you –</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: And I’ve got good news for you, Baxter.
All your troubles are over.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: I know how worried you were about Miss
Kubelik – well, stop worrying – I’m going to take her off your
hands.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: You’re going to take her off my hands?</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: That’s right. I’ve moved out of my house
– I’m going to be staying in town, at the Athletic Club.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: You left your wife?</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Well, if you must know – I fired my
secretary, my secretary got to my wife, and my wife fired me. Ain’t that
a kick in the head?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Yeah –</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Now what was your news, Baxter?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: It’s about Miss Kubelik – she’s all right again
– so she went back home.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Swell. And don’t think I’ve forgotten
what you did for me. This way, Baxter.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Sit down. Try it on for size.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: You like? It’s all yours.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Mine?</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: My assistant, Roy Thompson, has been
shifted to the Denver office, and you’re taking his place. What’s the
matter, Baxter? You don’t seem very excited.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Well, it’s just that so many things have been
happening so fast – I’m very pleased – especially for Miss Kubelik. Now
that I’ve gotten to know her better, I think she’s the kind of girl that
definitely ought to be married to somebody –</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Oh, sure, sure. But first the property
settlement has to be worked out – then it takes six weeks in Reno –
meanwhile, I’m going to enjoy being a bachelor for a while. Oh, by the
way, you can now have lunch in the executive dining room –</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: That’s just one of the privileges that
goes with this job. You also get a nice little expense account, the use
of the executive washroom – Say, what happened to you, Baxter?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I got kicked in the head, too.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Oh?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Good evening, Mr. Baxter.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Oh, Miss Kubelik. How do you feel?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Fine. How’s your eye?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: How’s everything at the apartment?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Nothing’s changed. You know, we never finished
that gin game –</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: I know. I suppose you heard about
Mr. Sheldrake –?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: You mean, leaving his wife? Yeah. I’m very
happy for you.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: I never thought he’d do it.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I told you all along. You see, you were wrong
about Mr. Sheldrake.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: I guess so.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: For that matter, you were wrong about me, too.
What you said about those who take and those who get took? Well,
Mr. Sheldrake wasn’t using me – I was using him. See? Last month I was
at desk 861 on the nineteenth floor – now I’m on the twenty-seventh
floor, paneled office, three windows – so it all worked out fine – we’re
both getting what we want.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Yes. You walking to the subway?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: No, thank you. I – well, to tell you the truth
– – I have this heavy date for tonight –</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Aren’t you meeting Mr. Sheldrake?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: No. You know how people talk. So I decided it
would be better if we didn’t see each other till everything is settled,
divorce-wise.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: That’s very wise.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Good night, Mr. Baxter.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Good night, Miss Kubelik.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Baxter – would you mind stepping in her
for a minute?</p>
<p><strong>baxter’s voice</strong>: Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.</p>
<p><strong>bootblack</strong>: Much obliged.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Here’s the breakdown of figures on personnel
turnover. Thirty-seven percent of our female employees leave to get
married, twenty-two percent quit because –</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: You’re working too hard, Baxter. It’s New
Year’s Eve – relax.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: I suppose you’ll be on the town tonight –
celebrating?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Naturally.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Me, too. I’m taking Miss Kubelik out – I
finally talked her into it –</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: The only thing is I’m staying at the
Athletic Club – and it’s strictly stag so if you don’t mind –</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Don’t mind what?</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: You know that other key to your apartment
– well, when we had that little scare about Miss Kubelik, I thought I’d
better get rid of it quick – so I threw it out the window of the
commuter train.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Very clever.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Now I’ll have to borrow your key.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: What do you mean, sorry?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: You’re not going to bring anybody up to my
apartment.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: I’m not just bringing anybody – I’m
bringing Miss Kubelik.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Especially not Miss Kubelik.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: How’s that again?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: No key!</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Baxter, I picked you for my team because
I thought you were a bright young man. You realize what you’re doing?
Not to me – but to yourself. Normally it takes years to work your way up
to the twenty-seventh floor – but it takes only thirty seconds to be out
on the street again. You dig?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I dig.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: So what’s it going to be?</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Now you’re being bright?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Thank you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Say, Baxter – you gave me the wrong
key.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: No I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: But this is the key to the executive
washroom.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: That’s right, Mr. Sheldrake. I won’t be needing
it – because I’m all washed up around here.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: What’s gotten into you, Baxter?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Just following doctor’s orders. I’ve decided to
become a mensch. You know what that means? A human being.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Now hold on, Baxter –</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Save it. The old payola won’t work any more.
Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfuss</strong>: Say, Baxter – we’re having a little
party and we ran out of ice – so I was wondering –</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Sure, Doc.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfuss</strong>: How come you’re alone on New Year’s
Eve?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Well, I have things to do –</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfuss</strong>: What’s this – you packing?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Yeah – I’m giving up the apartment.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfuss</strong>: Where are you moving to?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I don’t know. All I know is I got to get out of
this place.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfuss</strong>: Sorry to lose you, Baxter.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Me? Oh, you mean my body. Don’t worry, Doc –
it’ll go to the University – I’ll put it in writing –</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Can you use a bottle of champagne?</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfuss</strong>: Booze we don’t need. Why don’t you
join us, Baxter? We got two brain surgeons, an ear, nose and throat
specialist, a proctologist, and three nurses from Bellevue.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: No, thanks – I don’t feel like it. Look, Doc –
in case I don’t see you again – how much do I owe you for taking care of
that girl?</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfuss</strong>: Forget it – I didn’t do it as a doctor
– I did it as a neighbor. By the way, whatever happened to her?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: You know me with girls. Easy come, easy go.
Goodbye, Doc.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfuss</strong>: Happy New Year.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Sorry it took me so long on the phone.
But we’re all set.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: All set for what?</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: I rented a car – it’s going to be here at
one o’clock – we’re driving to Atlantic City.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Atlantic City?</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: I know it’s a drag – but you can’t find a
hotel room in town – not on New Year’s Eve.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Ring out the old year, ring in the new.
Ring-a-ding-ding.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: I didn’t plan it this way, Fran –
actually, it’s all Baxter’s fault.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Baxter?</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: He wouldn’t give me the key to the
apartment.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: He wouldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Just walked out on me – quit – threw that
big fat job right in my face.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: The nerve.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: That little punk – after all I did for
him! He said I couldn’t bring anybody to his apartment – especially not
Miss Kubelik. What’s he got against you, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: I don’t know. I guess that’s the way it
crumbles – cookie-wise.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: I’d spell it out for you – only I can’t
spell.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Happy New Year, Fran.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Fran – – where are you, Fran?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Mr. Baxter! Mr. Baxter! Mr. Baxter!</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Are you sure? How’s your knee?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I’m fine all over.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Mind if I come in?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Of course not.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Let me get another glass.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Who knows? Another neighborhood – another town
– another job – I’m on my own.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: That’s funny – so am I. What did you do with
the cards?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: In there.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: What about Mr. Sheldrake?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: I’m going to send him a fruit cake every
Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Cut.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I love you, Miss Kubelik.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Seven – – queen.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Did you hear what I said, Miss Kubelik? I
absolutely adore you.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Shut up and deal!</p>
