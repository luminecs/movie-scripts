<p><strong>titles: “e.t. - the extra-terrestial”</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>ext: night sky: night</strong>: The black screen becomes a
night sky. The camera angles lowers to show a forest against the night
sky.</p>
<p><strong>ext: landing site: night</strong>: In an opening in the
forest stands a spacecraft. The view of the craft is obscured by tree
branches. The atmosphere is misty, with blue lights coming from the
spacecraft.</p>
<p><strong>insert: alien hand</strong>: A strange hand, with two long
and slender fingers protruding, move aside a branch that obstructs the
view.</p>
<p><strong>int: spacecraft’s greenhouse: night</strong>: The inside of
the ship appears to be a greenhouse. There are sounds of water dripping.
Cone shaped objects sit among earth plants. Vapors flow up from the
plants.</p>
<p><strong>ext: spacecraft: night</strong>: A group of the aliens work
in front of the spacecraft. Suddenly, they hear a dog howl, and they all
stop working. Red lights begin to glow in their chests. It appears as if
their hearts have lit up at the sign of danger, as the red glow seeps
through their translucent skin. After a moment the red lights dim and
they return to their work.</p>
<p><strong>ext: forest: night</strong>: A small fern grows on the forest
floor. An alien hand, with two fingers protruding, reaches out for the
fern. The alien groans. A rabbit turns and listens. The fingers dig up
the plant as the rabbit watches. The alien then carefully uproots the
plant. A small wayward alien walks alone among the gigantic redwood
trees. He’s dwarfed by the huge trees.</p>
<p><strong>ext: hilltop: night</strong>: The creature stands alone on a
hilltop as he stares down at the city lights below. Suddenly he lets out
a moan of fright. A truck, with headlights glaring, pulls up next to
him. The creature runs from the lights. Several other trucks with head-
lights glaring drive up. Smoke flows from their exhaust pipes. Men’s
legs are seen as they walk among the trucks. They step into a mud puddle
as E.T. watches from behind a shrub. A man with keys jangling from his
waist walks past a headlight. He carries a flashlight in his hands.</p>
<p><strong>ext: spaceship: night</strong>: An alien stands in front of a
round light and transmits a homing signal, presumably to call the other
aliens back to the ship.</p>
<p><strong>ext: forest: night</strong>: When E.T hears the sound, his
red heart lights up. The homing signal reverberates in his chest.</p>
<p><strong>ext: spacecraft: night</strong>: The lights dim on the
footings of the spacecraft, presumably because the spacecraft is
preparing to takeoff.</p>
<p><strong>ext: forest: night</strong>: E.T. screams as he races for the
spacecraft. The glow from his red-heart reflects off the bushes as he
runs towards the white light of the spacecraft.</p>
<p><strong>ext: spacecraft: night</strong>: A lone alien stands before a
large round white light, as he signals for the other aliens to return to
the ship.</p>
<p><strong>ext: forest: night</strong>: Men with flashlights run through
the forest, as they pursue the red glowing light racing towards the
spacecraft. One of the pursuers is the man wearing the keys on his
waist.</p>
<p><strong>ext: spacecraft: night</strong>: The grated gangplank lifts
up, blocking the entrance to the ship. Behind the grate stands the alien
against the large round white light. The red light of the aliens heart
lights up as he stands behind the barrier.</p>
<p><strong>ext: forest: night</strong>: The men reach the edge of the
clearing and stop as they watch the spacecraft lift off.</p>
<p><strong>ext: hilltop: night</strong>: Below lies the city, lit up
against the dark night sky. E.T slowly makes his way down the slope.</p>
<p><strong>int: elliott’s house: night</strong>: A group of boys are
sitting around a table playing a DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS game. One boy is
on the telephone ordering a pizza. They throw wads of paper at each
other as they play.</p>
<p><strong>ext: elliott’s house: night</strong>: It’s a rainy, misty
night. Elliott, with ball and glove in hand wait at the bottom of the
driveway for the pizza. A car pulls up and parks in the driveway.
Elliott pays the driver, then takes the pizza box from him as the car
pulls out of the driveway.</p>
<p><strong>int: elliott’s house: night</strong>: Elliott’s mother wears
an orange outfit as she works in the kitchen. She bends over to put
dishes into the dishwasher. When she does this one of the young boys
reaches out to put his finger on her rear. Mike yells for him to stop.
He pulls his finger away.</p>
<p><strong>int: patio: night</strong>: Elliot walks past the ping pong
table when he hears more noises in the backyard. Again he calls out the
name “Harvey.” With the pizza box in hand, Elliot walks past the patio
table and towards the shed in the backyard. A bright crescent moon hangs
in the night sky. There is a mist in the air, and a bright light shines
in the shed. Elliott places the pizza box on the ground as he approaches
the shed. He’s still carrying the baseball and glove as he stands in
front of the shed’s entrance. He tosses the ball into the shed. After a
few seconds the ball is tossed back out at him and hits him on the
foot.</p>
<p><strong>int: elliott’s house: night</strong>: Elliott’s mother is
talking to the boys when Elliott runs into the house screaming that
there’s something in the tool shed. He tells them that it threw a ball
at him, but they continue to ignore him until he screams “QUIET!”
“Nobody go out there,” says Elliott. The boys immediately jump up from
the table. Two boys grab kitchen knives as Michael tells his mother to
stay inside. He and his friends will check it out. She yells at them to
put the knives back as she follows them outside.</p>
<p><strong>ext: shed: night</strong>: The light is still on in the
shed.</p>
<p><strong>ext: patio: night</strong>: Elliott’s mother walks into the
yard with a flashlight in her hand. She is surrounded by the boys as
they approach the shed. The mother says that there’s nothing in there as
Michael walks through the entrance. Michael bends down and finds tracks
on the dirt floor. “The coyote’s come back again, Ma.” he says. His
mother becomes frightened and orders them all back into the house.</p>
<p><strong>int: shed: night</strong>: The alien’s fingers point out into
the shed entrance, then wrap around the side of the door. The sound of
his heavy breathing is heard.</p>
<p><strong>int: elliott’s bedroom: night</strong>: The clock on the end
table indicates 2:00. Next to the clock is a picture of a dog,
presumably Harvey. This same dog lies asleep in the bed. He hears a
noise and picks up his head. He is in the lower half of a bunk bed. On
the top bunk sits Elliott. He is awake as he listens to the noise
outside.</p>
<p><strong>ext: backyard: night</strong>: Elliott opens a gate and walks
into the backyard. He carries a flashlight in his hand and shines it
into the cornfield next to his house. He walks into the field.</p>
<p><strong>ext: cornfield: night</strong>: Elliott walks into the
cornfield. He whistles, and gets entangled in the cornstalks as he
walks. He sees tracks in the dirt with his baseball nearby. He continues
to walk through the field.</p>
<p><strong>ext: backyard: night</strong>: Elliott runs into his
backyard. His play swings sway back and forth in the air, as if someone
had just bumped into them. Two garbage pails fall over near an open
metal gate at the top of a stone stairway. The garbage rolls out of the
cans and down the stone stairs. A red light by the gate lights the stone
stairway.</p>
<p><strong>ext: garage: day</strong>: Elliott rides down the driveway on
his bicycle. He next rides down a dirt road that overlooks the suburban
community.</p>
<p><strong>ext: forest road: day</strong>: Elliott holds a bag of candy
in one hand as he pours some into the other hand. He tosses candy onto
the round as he walks through the woods calling out for the
creature.</p>
<p><strong>int: elliott’s house: day</strong>: Elliott’s mother sits at
the tale with the dog, Harvey, at her side. Elliott, Michael and Gertie
are eating supper.</p>
<p><strong>ext: backyard: night</strong>: A crescent moon floats in the
sky. A bright light is on in the shed. In front of the shed Elliott lies
inside a sleeping bag on a folding chair with a flashlight in his hand.
He hears the sound of feet walking in the underbrush.</p>
<p><strong>int: elliott’s house: night</strong>: Elliott places candy on
the carpet, then walks backwards down the hallway towards his room. E.T.
walks up the stairs and reaches out for the candy, which he then takes
into his hand and eats.</p>
<p><strong>int: elliott’s room: night</strong>: Elliott places candy on
the floor by the entrance to his room. A sign on his door contains the
word “ENTER.” E.T picks up the candy.</p>
<p><strong>ext: forest: day</strong>: Mist envelops the fence and gate
in the section of the forest where E.T originally landed. Men with
flashlights and floodlights search throughout the area. “Keys” walks
into the forefront, holding a flashlight in his hand. He bends to the
ground and finds some candy.</p>
<p><strong>int: elliott’s room: day</strong>: Elliott lies in bed with a
thermometer in his mouth. His head rests on an orange pillow while his
mother sits besides him. She takes out the thermometer, reads it, then
says “Okay, you’re hot.” She then leaves the room. Elliott quickly
swings a lamp back over his head and heats the thermometer. He also
places a blue heating pad over his face, to heat himself. He then places
the thermometer back into his mouth, swings the lamp away, and places
the heating pad under the covers as his mother enters the room. She
opens his closet and separates the hanging clothes as she walks into the
closet. Elliott sits up in bed and intensely watches her.</p>
<p><strong>ext: driveway: day</strong>: Mike backs the car down the
driveway.</p>
<p><strong>intercut: elliott’s room</strong>: Mary walks out of the
closet carrying a blue sleeping bag. Elliott is tense, then relieved,
once he realizes that she didn’t find E.T. He falls back into bed.</p>
<p><strong>intercut: driveway</strong>: Mike backs the car over part of
the lawn.</p>
<p><strong>intercut: elliott’s room</strong>: Mary covers Elliott with
the blue sleeping bag as Elliott puts the thermometer back into his
mouth .</p>
<p><strong>intercut: driveway</strong>: Mike continues to back the car
down the driveway. He overshoots the edge and goes out into the street.
He then pulls forward across the sidewalk.</p>
<p><strong>intercut: elliott’s room</strong>: “You were outside waiting
for that thing?” says Mary. Elliott nods.</p>
<p><strong>ext: driveway: day</strong>: Mary runs down the driveway
towards the car. Gertie points out the patches of lawn that Mike pulled
onto the driveway as he was driving the car. Mary pulls her into the
car.</p>
<p><strong>int: elliott’s room: day</strong>: Elliott gestures for E.T.
to walk out of the closet, which he does. He is wearing Elliott’s robe.
Elliott asks him if he talks.</p>
<p><strong>int: kitchen: day</strong>: Elliott, dressed only in white
underwear, opens the refrigerator door and takes out some food.</p>
<p><strong>intercut: elliott’s room</strong>: E.T. walks around the
room.</p>
<p><strong>intercut: kitchen</strong>: Elliott opens up a jar of peanut
butter.</p>
<p><strong>intercut: elliott’s room</strong>: E.T. touches a tennis
racket.</p>
<p><strong>intercut: kitchen</strong>: Elliott picks up cheese and
tomatoes.</p>
<p><strong>intercut: elliott’s room</strong>: E.T. picks up an
umbrella.</p>
<p><strong>intercut: kitchen</strong>: Elliott takes a carton of milk
out of the refrigerator.</p>
<p><strong>intercut: elliott’s room</strong>: E.T. accidentally opens up
the umbrella.</p>
<p><strong>intercut: kitchen</strong>: Elliott screams with fright and
drops the milk carton onto the floor.</p>
<p><strong>intercut: elliott’s room</strong>: E.T. screams with fright,
drops the umbrella, then runs into the closet.</p>
<p><strong>int: elliott’s room: day</strong>: Elliott carries a plate of
food into the room. He walks past the open umbrella and looks into the
closet. Stuffed animals line the back of the closet wall. E.T. pushes
the animals forward. He was hiding behind them. He is still shaking from
the fright experience. “Are you okay? Too much excitement, huh? You want
a coke?”</p>
<p><strong>ext: driveway: day</strong>: Michael runs up the driveway
towards his house. He’s wearing a red football blazer.</p>
<p><strong>int: elliott’s house: day</strong>: Michael opens the front
door and runs into the house. He takes off his red shirt to reveal the
blue shirt he’s wearing underneath. He picks up a magazine then opens
the refrigerator. “Nothing but health shit,” he says, as he takes out a
can and shakes it.</p>
<p><strong>int: elliott’s room: day</strong>: Elliott walks away from
his closet and opens the door to his room. He tells Mike to come in.
Both boys are dressed in blue and white colors. Mike calls Elliott a
faker, then starts to tell him about scores on an asteroid game, when
Elliott interrupts, to tell him about the goblin. Michael makes fun of
Elliott and his belief that the goblin has returned. But Elliott
persists, and makes Mike promise to give Elliott “absolute power.”</p>
<p><strong>int: closet: day</strong>: E.T.’s head appears among the
stuffed animals. Mike has his hand over Gertie’s mouth as she tries to
scream. Mary walks past the closet door. Mary asks Elliot to keep an eye
on Gertie while she takes a shower. She kisses him on the head then
leaves the room. Elliott opens the closet door. Michael, in awe with
mouth open wide, watches as Elliott approaches E.T.</p>
<p><strong>ext: community: day</strong>: On the hilltop overlooking the
neighborhood stands a man with a camera as he takes photos of the houses
below. The man with keys on his waist walks into the area, as other men
comb the ground with electronic equipment.</p>
<p><strong>int: elliott`s house: night</strong>: Mary, carrying a yellow
watering pail, walks across the room and waters a large plant. Gertie
pulls a little red wagon into the hallway. When asked by Mary what she’s
doing, Gertie replies that she’s going to play in Elliott’s room. “Okay,
don’t let them torture you,” says the mother. “I won’t, Mary,” replies
Gertie.</p>
<p><strong>int: elliott’s room: night</strong>: Gertie knocks on the
door. Mike lets her and Harvey into the room. They walk to the table
where E.T. and Elliott are sitting. Gertie puts the sickly plant n the
table. E.T. puts his finger into the plant. Elliott opens up an
encyclopedia and points to California on a map of the United States. “We
are here,” Elliott says as E.T. munches on celery. Michael hands Elliott
a globe and tells him to use this instead of the map. Elliott points to
the globe, then asks E.T. where he’s from. E.T. points out the window.
Elliott opens the book to a page that has the map of a galaxy. He points
to the planet earth, touches the globe, then says “HOME, HOME.” E.T.
makes a soft noise that sounds similar to the word “home.” Gertie
watches him as he picks up round objects and places them on the map:
three small pieces of fruit and two eggs. E.T.’s eyes concentrate on the
table, which then starts to shake. The two eggs and three small pieces
of fruit then lift off the table and float in the air. The children
watch with awe.</p>
<p><strong>ext: backyard: night</strong>: Elliott runs by the shed, past
a swaying swing, up the stairs to the red lamppost and to the wire gate.
He strains to hear the sounds of men talking.</p>
<p><strong>int: elliott’s room: night</strong>: E.T. sits next to a lamp
as he reads a child’s ABC book. He sits next to a Raggedy Ann doll.]</p>
<p><strong>ext: elliott’s house: day</strong>: Elliott and Mike walk
down the driveway. They are on their way to school. They discuss E.T.,
arguing about how smart he is.</p>
<p><strong>ext: street: day</strong>: Mike and Elliot walk towards a bus
stop where a group of children are waiting. Mike’s friends torment
Elliott about his “goblin.”</p>
<p><strong>int: elliott’s house: day</strong>: Gertie stands on the
stairway looking up, presumably thinking about E.T. in Elliott’s room.
Mary comes running downstairs and tells Gertie that they have to get
into the car, otherwise they’ll be late. Suddenly, Mary hears a noise
upstairs. She goes up to see what caused the sound.</p>
<p><strong>int: elliott’s bedroom: day</strong>: Mary walks into the
closet and looks around. The camera pans across the large faces of all
the stuffed dolls: Raggedy Ann, a Bear, a Monkey, E.T.’s Face, a Lion,
etc. Mary doesn’t notice E.T., then closes the closet door and
leaves.</p>
<p><strong>int: school: day</strong>: A teacher walks down the aisle and
announces to the class that today they will perform the frog dissection
for which they have been preparing. As he passes Elliott’s desk, he
starts to say “frogs similar to,” then he notices the drawing of E.T.
The teacher picks it up. Elliott turns to see the pretty blonde girl
staring at him. Realizing she’s been caught, she quickly turns and looks
away.</p>
<p><strong>int: elliott’s room: day</strong>: E.T. opens the door to
Elliott’s room and walks out into the hallway. Harvey sees and quickly
approaches.</p>
<p><strong>intercut: classroom</strong>: The teacher continues his
instructions, telling the students that the scalpel is very sharp, and
that they should use discretion when cutting. There should be very
little blood, and maybe a little body fluids.</p>
<p><strong>int: kitchen: day</strong>: E.T., wearing a blue-flannel
shirt, walks into the kitchen with Harvey at his side. He opens the
refrigerator. Harvey licks his lips as he watches in anticipation of
getting something to eat. E.T. takes out a plastic container of potato
salad, opens it, then sticks his tongue into the salad. He hates the
taste and throws it onto the floor. Harvey licks it up. E.T. then picks
up a can of beer and drinks it as Harvey barks.</p>
<p><strong>intercut: school</strong>: Elliott sits at his desk as he
listens to the teacher speak. Elliott burps. All the children in the
classroom stare at him.</p>
<p><strong>intercut: kitchen</strong>: E.T., drunk, wobbles across the
kitchen floor and walks into a counter.</p>
<p><strong>intercut: school</strong>: Elliott places his fingers to his
head. He is also becoming drunk. The teacher tells the class that in
this bisection they should locate the heart and notice that it is still
beating.</p>
<p><strong>intercut: kitchen</strong>: E.T. turns and walks into another
wall as Harvey continues to eat the potato salad on the floor.</p>
<p><strong>intercut: school</strong>: Elliott, now drunk, slides down in
his chair.</p>
<p><strong>intercut: kitchen</strong>: E.T. turns, walks, then collapses
head first onto the floor.</p>
<p><strong>intercut: school</strong>: Elliott slides under his desk and
falls onto the floor. The teacher doesn’t hear this because at that
moment he pulls down a wall hanging which contains pictures of a frog’s
anatomy.</p>
<p><strong>intercut: kitchen</strong>: E.T. opens another can of
beer.</p>
<p><strong>intercut: school</strong>: Elliott pulls himself up off the
floor with a drunken smile on his face.</p>
<p><strong>intercut: kitchen</strong>: E.T. gulps down another can of
beer.</p>
<p><strong>intercut: school</strong>: Elliott, drunk, sits at his desk.
He turns and smiles at the pretty blonde girl across the aisle. She
turns away from him with disgust.</p>
<p><strong>intercut: living room</strong>: E.T. plays on the keys of a
voice generating language game. He next presses a button on a remote
control which activates the TV set. A cartoon appears with a cat getting
its tail caught on fire. The cat screams and E.T reacts with horror. He
throws the beer can at the TV set.</p>
<p><strong>intercut: school</strong>: The teacher carries a jar of
cotton balls soaked in chloroform, which he drops into the jars
containing frogs. He tells the children to immediately put the lids on
the jars. After telling the children that this won’t hurt the frogs, he
places a cotton ball into the last two jars, one of which belongs to
Elliott. Elliott doesn’t place the cover on his jar, but instead sadly
watches as the frog tries to escape. Slowly he places to lid on it, as
he gazes at the frog.</p>
<p><strong>closeup: e.t.’s face</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>intercut: living room</strong>: E.T. has a hangover as he
hiccups and puts his hand on his head. He then picks up the cartoon
section of a newspaper. One cartoon strip has a picture of a
communication device with a caption stating “HELP, HELP.”</p>
<p><strong>intercut: school</strong>: “Save him” shouts Elliott. Elliott
picks up his jar, unscrews the top, then lets out his frog, screaming
“Run for your life. Back to the forest! Run!”</p>
<p><strong>intercut: livingroom</strong>: E.T. studies the electronic
circuitry of the language game. Suddenly John Wayne comes on the screen.
E.T. is fascinated with his image. It’s a scene from the movie “QUIET
MAN.” Maureen O’Sullivan huddles in a corner of the room.</p>
<p><strong>intercut: school</strong>: A pile of frogs gather at the feet
of a terrified little girl with blonde braids. Elliott, drunk, staggers
by her.</p>
<p><strong>intercut: livingroom</strong>: E.T. continues to watch the TV
monitor as the woman in the movie screams.</p>
<p><strong>intercut: school</strong>: A blonde girl who has a crush on
Elliott screams when a frog is placed on her shoes.</p>
<p><strong>intercut: livingroom</strong>: The woman in the movie runs
out the door. John Wayne grabs hold of her arm.</p>
<p><strong>intercut: school</strong>: Elliott grabs hold of the blonde
girl as she runs out the door.</p>
<p><strong>intercut: livingroom</strong>: John Wayne pulls the woman
back.</p>

sway. He scratches his face, as does E.T. Together they stare at the

in the hanger across the flat surface of the blade, and sends signals
out into space. Elliott is overjoyed and shouts that it works, while
E.T. repeats the word “Home.” Together they gaze up to the stars.</p>
