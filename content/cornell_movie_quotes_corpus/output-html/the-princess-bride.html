<p><strong>mother</strong>: You feeling any better?</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: A little bit.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Guess what.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Your grandfather’s here.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Mom, can’t you tell him that I’m sick?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: You are sick, that’s why he’s here.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: He’ll pinch my cheek. I hate that.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Maybe he won’t.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Hey! How’s the sickie? Heh?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: I think I’ll leave you two pals.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: I brought you a special present.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Open it up.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: A book?</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: That’s right. When I was your age,
television was called books. And this is a special book. It was the book
my father used to read to me when I was sick, and I used to read it to
your father. And today, I’m gonna read it to you.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Has it got any sports in it?</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Are you kidding? Fencing. Fighting.
Torture. Revenge. Giants. Monsters. Chases. Escapes. True love.
Miracles.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: It doesn’t sound too bad. I’ll try and stay
awake.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Oh. Well, thank you very much. It’s
very nice of you. Your vote of confidence is overwhelming. All right.
The Princess Bride, by S. Morgenstern. Chapter One. Buttercup was raised
on a small farm in the country of Florin.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Her favorite pastimes were riding her
horse and tormenting the farm boy that worked there. His name was
Westley, but she never called him that. Isn’t that a wonderful
beginning?</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Yeah. It’s really good.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Nothing gave Buttercup as much pleasure
as ordering Westley around.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: ————————————————————————— 4.</p>
<p><strong>buttercup</strong>: Farm boy. Polish my horse’s saddle. I
want to see my face shining in it by morning.</p>
<p><strong>westley</strong>: As you wish.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: “As you wish” was all he ever said to
her.</p>
<p><strong>buttercup</strong>: Farm Boy. Fill these with water –
–please.</p>
<p><strong>westley</strong>: As you wish.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: That day, she was amazed to discover
that when he was saying, “As you wish,” what he meant was, “I love
you.”</p>
<p><strong>dissolve to:</strong>: ————————————————————————— 5.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: And even more amazing was the day she
realized she truly loved him back.</p>
<p><strong>buttercup</strong>: Farm Boy, fetch me that pitcher.</p>
<p><strong>westley</strong>: As you wish.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: -hold it, hold it-</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: What is this? Are you trying to trick me? –
Where’s the sports? – Is this a kissing book?</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: – wait, just wait –</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: – well, when does it get good?</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Keep your shirt on. Let me read.
Westley had no money for marriage. So he packed his few belongings and
left the farm to seek his fortune across the sea.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: ————————————————————————— 6.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: It was a very emotional time for
Buttercup –</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: I don’t be-leeve this.</p>
<p><strong>buttercup</strong>: I fear I’ll never see you again.</p>
<p><strong>westley</strong>: Of course you will.</p>
<p><strong>buttercup</strong>: But what if something happens to you?</p>
<p><strong>westley</strong>: Hear this now: I will come for you.</p>
<p><strong>buttercup</strong>: But how can you be sure?</p>
<p><strong>westley</strong>: This is true love. You think this happens
every day?</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Westley didn’t reach his destination.
His ship was attacked by the Dread Pirate Roberts, who never left
captives alive. When Buttercup got the news that Westley was murdered
–</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: – murdered by pirates is good –</p>
<p><strong>close up</strong>: Buttercup, staring out the window of her
room. ————————————————————————— 7.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: She went into her room and shut the
door. And for days, she neither slept nor ate.</p>
<p><strong>buttercup</strong>: I will never love again.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Five years later, the main square of
Florin City was filled as never before to hear the announcement of the
great Prince Humperdinck’s bride-to be.</p>
<p><strong>humperdinck</strong>: My people … a month from now, our
country will have its 500th anniversary. On that sundown, I shall marry
a lady who was once a commoner like yourselves – – but perhaps you will
not find her common now. Would you like to meet her?</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: ————————————————————————— 8.</p>
<p><strong>humperdinck</strong>: My people … the Princess
Buttercup!!</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Buttercup’s emptiness consumed her.
Although the law of the land gave Humperdinck the right to choose his
bride, she did not love him.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Despite Humperdinck’s reassurance that
she would grow to love him, the only joy she found was in her daily
ride.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: ————————————————————————— 9.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: A word, my lady?</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: We are but poor, lost circus performers. Is
there a village nearby?</p>
<p><strong>buttercup</strong>: There is nothing nearby; not for
miles.</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: Then there will be no one to hear you
scream-</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: What is that you’re ripping?</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: It’s fabric from the uniform of an Army
officer of Guilder.</p>
<p><strong>fezzik</strong>: Who’s Guilder?</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: The country across the sea. The sworn enemy
of Florin. Go!</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: Once the horse reaches the castle, the
fabric will make the Prince suspect the Guilderians have abducted his
love. When he finds her body dead on the Guilder frontier, his
suspicions will be totally confirmed.</p>
<p><strong>fezzik</strong>: You never said anything about killing
anyone.</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: I’ve hired you to help me start a war.
That’s a prestigious line of work with a long and glorious
tradition.</p>
<p><strong>fezzik</strong>: I just don’t think it’s right, killing an
innocent girl.</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: Am I going mad or did the word “think”
escape your lips? You were not hired for your brains, you hippopotamic
land mass.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: I agree with Fezzik.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: ————————————————————————— 11.</p>
<p><strong>close up</strong>: Vizzini, in a fury.</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: was in a fury –now</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: – when I found you, you were so slobbering
drunk you couldn’t buy brandy – – and you – friendless, brainless,
helpless, hopeless – Do you want me to send you back to where you were,
unemployed in Greenland?</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: That Vizzini, he can fuss.</p>
<p><strong>fezzik</strong>: … fuss … fuss … I think he likes to scream
at us.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: Probably he means no harm.</p>
<p><strong>fezzik</strong>: He’s really very short on charm.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: Oh, you’ve a great gift for rhyme.</p>
<p><strong>fezzik</strong>: Yes, some of the time.</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: Enough of that.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: FEZZIK, are there rocks ahead?</p>
<p><strong>fezzik</strong>: If there are, we’ll all be dead.</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: No more rhymes now, I mean it.</p>
<p><strong>fezzik</strong>: Anybody want a peanut?</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: We’ll reach the Cliffs by dawn.</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: Why are you doing that?</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: Making sure nobody’s following us.</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: That would be inconceivable.</p>
<p><strong>buttercup</strong>: Despite what you think, you will be
caught. And when you are, the Prince will see you all hanged.</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: Of all the necks on this boat, Highness,
the one you should be worrying about is your own.</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: Stop doing that. We can all relax, it’s
almost over-</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: You’re sure nobody’s following us?</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: As I told you, it would be absolutely,
totally, and in all other ways, inconceivable. No one in Guilder knows
what we’ve done. And no one in Florin could have gotten here so fast.
Out of curiosity, why do you ask?</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: No reason. It’s only, I just happened to look
behind us, and something is there.</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: Probably some local fisherman out for a
pleasure cruise at night through eel-infested waters.</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: Go in, get after her!</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: I don’t swim.</p>
<p><strong>fezzik</strong>: I only dog paddle.</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: Veer left. Left. Left!</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: Do you know what that sound is, Highness?
Those are the Shrieking Eels – if you doubt me, just wait. They always
grow louder when they’re about to feed on human flesh.</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: If you swim back now, I promise, no harm
will come to you. I doubt you will get such an offer from the Eels.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: She doesn’t get eaten by the Eels at
this time.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: The Eel doesn’t get her. I’m explaining
to you because you looked nervous.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Well, I wasn’t nervous.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Well, maybe I was a little bit concerned.
But that’s not the same thing.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Because I can stop now if you want.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: No. You could read a little bit more … if
you want.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: “Do you know what that sound is,
Highness?”</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: Those are the Shrieking Eels.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: We’re past that, Grandpa.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: You read it already.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Oh. Oh my goodness, I did. I’m sorry.
Beg your pardon.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: All right, all right, let’s see. Uh,
she was in the water, the Eel was coming after her. She was frightened.
The Eel started to charge her. And then -</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: ————————————————————————— 18.</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: Put her down. Just put her down.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: I think he’s getting closer.</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: He’s no concern of ours. Sail on! I suppose
you think you’re brave, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>buttercup</strong>: Only compared to some.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: Look! He’s right on top of us. I wonder if he
is using the same wind we are using.</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: Whoever he is, he’s too late – – see? The
Cliffs of Insanity.</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: Hurry up. Move the thing! Um … that other
thing. Move it! We’re safe – only FEZZIK is strong enough to go up our
way – he’ll have to sail around for hours ’til he finds a harbor.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: He’s climbing the rope. And he’s gaining on
us.</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: Inconceivable!</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: ————————————————————————— 21.</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: Faster!</p>
<p><strong>fezzik</strong>: I thought I was going faster.</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: You were supposed to be this colossus. You
were this great, legendary thing. And yet he gains.</p>
<p><strong>fezzik</strong>: Well, I’m carrying three people. And he’s
got only himself.</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: – I do not accept excuses. I’m just going
to have to find myself a new giant, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>fezzik</strong>: Don’t say that, Vizzini. Please.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: ————————————————————————— 22.</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: Did I make it clear that your job is at
stake?</p>
<p><strong>fezzik</strong>: He has very good arms.</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: He didn’t fall? Inconceivable!!</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: You keep using that word – I do not think it
means what you think it means. My God! He’s climbing.</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: Whoever he is, he’s obviously seen us with
the Princess, and must therefore die. You, carry her. We’ll head
straight for the Guilder frontier. Catch up when he’s dead. If he falls,
fine. If not, the sword.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: I want to duel him left-handed.</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: You know what a hurry we’re in.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: Well, it’s the only way I can be satisfied.
If I use my right – tch – over too quickly.</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: Oh, have it your way.</p>
<p><strong>fezzik</strong>: You be careful. – people in masks cannot be
trusted.</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: I’m waiting!</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: ————————————————————————— 25.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: Hello there.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: Slow going?</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: Look, I don’t mean to be rude, but
this is not as easy as it looks. So I’d appreciate it if you wouldn’t
distract me.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: I do not suppose you could speed things
up?</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: If you’re in such a hurry, you could
lower a rope, or a tree branch, or find something useful to do.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: I could do that. In fact, I’ve got some rope
up here. But I do not think that you will accept my help, since I am
only waiting around to kill you.</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: That does put a damper on our
relationship.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: But I promise I will not kill you until you
reach the top.</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: That’s very comforting. But I’m afraid
you’ll just have to wait.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a
Spaniard.</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: No good. I’ve known too many
Spaniards.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: You don’t know any way you’ll trust me?</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: Nothing comes to mind.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: I swear on the soul of my father, Domingo
Montoya, you will reach the top alive.</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: Throw me the rope.</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: We’ll wait until you’re ready.</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: Again. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: I do not mean to pry, but you don’t by any
chance happen to have six fingers on your right hand?</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: Do you always begin conversations this
way?</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: My father was slaughtered by a sixfingered
man. He was a great swordmaker, my father. And when the six-fingered man
appeared and requested a special sword, my father took the job. He
slaved a year before he was done.</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: I have never seen its equal.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: The six-fingered man returned and demanded
it, but at one-tenth his promised price. My father refused. Without a
word, the six-fingered man slashed him through the heart. I loved my
father, so, naturally, challenged his murderer to a duel … I failed
…</p>
<p>****: ————————————————————————— 29.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: the six-fingered man did leave me alive with
the six-fingered sword, but he gave me these.</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: How old were you?</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: I was eleven years old. When I was strong
enough, I dedicated my life to the study of fencing. So the next time we
meet, I will not fail. I will go up to the sixfingered man and say,
“Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to
die.”</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: You’ve done nothing but study
swordplay?</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: More pursuit than study lately. You see, I
cannot find him. It’s been twenty years now. I am starting to lose
confidence. I just work for Vizzini to pay the bills. There’s not a lot
of money in revenge.</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: great sword, starting</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: You are ready, then?</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: Whether I am or not, you’ve been more
than fair.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: You seem a decent fellow. I hate to kill
you.</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: You seem a decent fellow. I hate to
die.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: Begin!</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: You’re using Bonetti’s defense against me,
ah?</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: I thought it fitting, considering the
rocky terrain –</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: Naturally, you must expect me to attack with
Capo Ferro.</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: – naturally – –but I find Thibault
cancels out Capo Ferro, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: Unless the enemy has studied his Agrippa-</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: – which I have.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: You are wonderful!</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: Thank you – I’ve worked hard to become
so.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: I admit it – you are better than I am.</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: Then why are you smiling?</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: Because I know something you don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: And what is that?</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: I am not left-handed.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: ————————————————————————— 33.</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: You’re amazing!</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: I ought to be after twenty years.</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: There’s something I ought to tell
you.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: I am not left-handed either.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: Who are you?!</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: No one of consequence.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: I must know.</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: Get used to disappointment.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: ————————————————————————— 35.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: Kill me quickly.</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: I would as soon destroy a stained
glass window as an artist like yourself. However, since I can’t have you
following me either –</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: Please understand, I hold you in the
highest respect.</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: Inconceivable!</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: Give her to me. Catch up with us
quickly.</p>
<p><strong>fezzik</strong>: What do I do?</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: Finish him, finish him. Your way.</p>
<p><strong>fezzik</strong>: Oh, good, my way. Thank you, Vizzini. Which
way is my way?</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: Pick up one of those rocks, get behind the
boulder, and in a few minutes, the Man in Black will come running around
the bend. The minute his head is in view, hit it with the rock!</p>
<p><strong>fezzik</strong>: My way’s not very sportsmanlike.</p>
<p><strong>dissolve to:</strong>: ————————————————————————— 37.</p>
<p><strong>fezzik</strong>: I did that on purpose. I don’t have to
miss.</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: I believe you – So what happens
now?</p>
<p><strong>fezzik</strong>: We face each other as God intended.
Sportsmanlike. No tricks, no weapons, skill against skill alone.</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: You mean, you’ll put down your rock
and I’ll put down my sword, and we’ll try to kill each other like
civilized people?</p>
<p><strong>fezzik</strong>: I could kill you now.</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: Frankly, I think the odds are slightly
in your favor at hand fighting.</p>
<p><strong>fezzik</strong>: It’s not my fault being the biggest and the
strongest. I don’t even exercise.</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: Look are you just fiddling around with
me or what?</p>
<p><strong>fezzik</strong>: I just want you to feel you’re doing well. I
hate for people to die embarrassed.</p>
<p><strong>fezzik</strong>: You’re quick.</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: And a good thing too.</p>
<p><strong>fezzik</strong>: Why do you wear a mask? Were you burned by
acid, or something like that?</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: Oh no. It’s just that they’re terribly
comfortable. I think everyone will be wearing them in the future.</p>
<p><strong>fezzik</strong>: I just figured out why you give me so much
trouble.</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: Why is that, do you think?</p>
<p><strong>fezzik</strong>: beginning to get a</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: ————————————————————————— 40.</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: Why should that make such a
difference?</p>
<p><strong>fezzik</strong>: Well … … you see, you use different moves
when you’re fighting half a dozen people than when you only have to be
worried about one.</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: I don’t envy you the headache you will
have when you awake. But, in the meantime, rest well … and dream of
large women.</p>
<p><strong>humperdinck</strong>: There was a mighty duel – it ranged all
over. They were both masters.</p>
<p><strong>rugen</strong>: Who won? How did it end?</p>
<p><strong>humperdinck</strong>: position where Inigo direction Vizzini
and</p>
<p><strong>rugen</strong>: Shall we track them both?</p>
<p><strong>humperdinck</strong>: The loser is nothing. – Only the
Princess matters – – clearly this was all planned by warriors of
Guilder. We must be ready for whatever lies ahead.</p>
<p><strong>rugen</strong>: Could this be a trap?</p>
<p><strong>humperdinck</strong>: I always think everything could be a
trap – Which is why I’m still alive.</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: So, it is down to you. And it is down to
me.</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: If you wish her dead, by all means keep
moving forward.</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: Let me explain-</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: – there’s nothing to explain. You’re trying
to kidnap what I’ve rightfully stolen.</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: Perhaps an arrangement can be
reached.</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: There will be no arrangement – – and you’re
killing her!</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: But if there can be no arrangement,
then we are at an impasse.</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: I’m afraid so – I can’t compete with you
physically. And you’re no match for my brains.</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: You’re that smart?</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: Let me put it this way: have you ever heard
of Plato, Aristotle, Socrates?</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: Morons.</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: Really? In that case, I challenge you
to a battle of wits.</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: For the Princess?</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: To the death?</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: I accept.</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: Good. Then pour the wine.</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: Inhale this, but do not touch.</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: I smell nothing.</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: What you do not smell is called iocane
powder. It is odorless, tasteless, dissolves instantly in liquid, and is
among the more deadlier poisons known to man.</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: Hmm.</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: All right: where is the poison? The
battle of wits has begun. It ends when you decide and we both drink, and
find out who is right and who is dead.</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: But it’s so simple. All I have to do is
divine from what I know of you. Are you the sort of man who would put
the poison into his own goblet, or his enemy’s?</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: Now, a clever man would put the poison into
his own goblet, because he would know that only a great fool would reach
for what he was given. I’m not a great fool, so I can clearly not choose
the wine in front of you. But you must have known I was not a great
fool; you would have counted on it, so I can clearly not choose the wine
in front of me.</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: You’ve made your decision then7</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: Not remotely. Because iocane comes from
Australia, as everyone knows. And Australia is entirely peopled with
criminals. And criminals are used to having people not trust them, as
you are not trusted by me. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front
of you.</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: Truly, you have a dizzying
intellect.</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: Wait till I get going! Where was I?</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: Australia.</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: Yes – Australia, and you must have
suspected I would have known the powder’s origin, so I can clearly not
choose the wine in front of me.</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: You’re just stalling now.</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: You’d like to think that, wouldn’t you?
You’ve beaten my giant, which means you’re exceptionally strong. So, you
could have put the poison in your own goblet, trusting on your strength
to save you. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But,
you’ve also bested my Spaniard which means you must have studied. And in
studying, you must have learned that man is mortal so you would have put
the poison as far from yourself as possible, so I can clearly not choose
the wine in front of me.</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: You’re trying to trick me into giving
away something – it won’t work –</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: It has worked – you’ve given everything
away – I know where the poison is.</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: Then make your choice.</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: I will. And I choose –</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: – what in the world can that be?</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: ————————————————————————— 47.</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: What? Where? I don’t see anything.</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: Oh, well, I-I could have sworn I saw
something. No matter.</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: What’s so funny?</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: I’ll tell you in a minute. First, let’s
drink – me from my glass, and you from yours.</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: You guessed wrong.</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: You only think I guessed wrong – – that’s
what’s so funny! I switched glasses when your back was turned. You
fool.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: ————————————————————————— 48.</p>
<p><strong>vizzini</strong>: You fell victim to one of the classic
blunders. The most famous is “Never get involved in a land war in Asia.”
But only slightly less well known is this: “Never go in against a
Sicilian when death is on the line.”</p>
<p><strong>buttercup</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: I am no one to be trifled with, that
is all you ever need know.</p>
<p><strong>buttercup</strong>: To think – all that time it was your cup
that was poisoned.</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: They were both poisoned. I spent the
last few years building up an immunity to iocane powder.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: ————————————————————————— 49.</p>
<p><strong>humperdinck</strong>: Someone has beaten a giant! There will
be great suffering in Guilder if she dies.</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: carrying the promise</p>
<p><strong>buttercup</strong>: If you’ll release me … whatever you ask
for ransom … you’ll get it, I promise you…</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: And what is that worth, the promise of
a woman? You’re very funny, Highness.</p>
<p><strong>buttercup</strong>: I was giving you a chance. No matter
where you take me … there’s no greater hunter than Prince Humperdinck.
He could track a falcon on a cloudy day. He can find you</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: You think your dearest love will save
you?</p>
<p><strong>buttercup</strong>: I never said he was my dearest love. And
yes, he will save me. That I know.</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: You admit to me you do not love your
fiance?</p>
<p><strong>buttercup</strong>: He knows I do not love him.</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: “Are not capable of love” is what you
mean.</p>
<p><strong>buttercup</strong>: I have loved more deeply than a killer
like yourself could ever dream.</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: That was a warning, Highness. The next
time, my hand flies on its own. For where I come from, there are
penalties when a woman lies.</p>
<p><strong>humperdinck</strong>: Iocane. I’d bet my life on it. And
there are the Princess’s footprints. She is alive … or was, an hour ago.
If she is otherwise when I find her, I shall be very put out.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: ————————————————————————— 51.</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: Rest, Highness.</p>
<p><strong>buttercup</strong>: I know who you are – your cruelty reveals
everything.</p>
<p><strong>buttercup</strong>: You’re the Dread Pirate Roberts; admit
it.</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: With pride. What can I do for you?</p>
<p><strong>buttercup</strong>: You can die slowly cut into a thousand
pieces.</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: Hardly complimentary, Your Highness.
Why loose your venom on me?</p>
<p><strong>buttercup</strong>: You killed my love.</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: It’s possible; I kill a lot of people.
Who was this love of yours? Another Prince, like this one, ugly, rich,
and scabby?</p>
<p><strong>buttercup</strong>: No. A farm boy. Poor. Poor and perfect,
with eyes like the sea after a storm.</p>
<p><strong>buttercup</strong>: On the high seas, your ship attacked, and
the Dread Pirate Roberts never takes prisoners.</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: I can’t afford to make exceptions.
Once word leaks out that a pirate has gone soft, people begin to disobey
you, and then it’s nothing but work, work, work, all the time.</p>
<p><strong>buttercup</strong>: You mock my pain!</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: Life is pain, Highness. Anyone who
says differently is selling something. I remember this farm boy of
yours, I think. This would be, what, five years ago?</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: Does it bother you to hear?</p>
<p><strong>buttercup</strong>: Nothing you can say will upset me.</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: He died well, that should please you.
No bribe attempts or blubbering. He simply said, “Please. Please, I need
to live.” It was the “please” that caught my memory.</p>
<p>****: ————————————————————————— 53.</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: I asked him what was so important for
him. “True love,” he replied. And then he spoke of a girl of surpassing
beauty and faithfulness. I can only assume he meant you. You should
bless me for destroying him before he found out what you really are.</p>
<p><strong>buttercup</strong>: And what am I?</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: Faithfulness he talked of, madam. Your
enduring faithfulness. Now, tell me truly. When you found out he was
gone, did you get engaged to your prince that same hour, or did you wait
a whole week out of respect for the dead?</p>
<p><strong>buttercup</strong>: You mocked me once, never do it again – I
died that day!</p>
<p><strong>buttercup</strong>: You can die too, for all I care!!</p>
<p><strong>man in black</strong>: … as … you … wish…</p>
<p><strong>buttercup</strong>: Oh, my sweet Westley; what have I
done?</p>
<p><strong>humperdinck</strong>: Disappeared. He must have seen us
closing in, which might account for his panicking in error. Unless I’m
wrong, and I am never wrong, they are headed dead into the fire
swamp.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: ————————————————————————— 55.</p>
<p><strong>westley</strong>: Can you move at all?</p>
<p><strong>buttercup</strong>: Move? You’re alive. If you want, I can
fly.</p>
<p><strong>westley</strong>: I told you, “I would always come for you.”
Why didn’t you wait for me?</p>
<p><strong>buttercup</strong>: Well … you were dead.</p>
<p><strong>westley</strong>: Death cannot stop true love. All it can do
is delay it for a while.</p>
<p><strong>buttercup</strong>: I will never doubt again.</p>
<p><strong>westley</strong>: There will never be a need.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Oh no. No, please.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: What is it? What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: They’re kissing again, do we have to hear
the kissing part?</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Someday, you may not mind so much.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Skip on to the Fire Swamp – that sounded
good.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Oh. You’re sick, I’ll humor you. So
now, where were we here? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ah. Oh. Okay. Westley and
Buttercup raced along the ravine floor.</p>
<p><strong>westley</strong>: Ha. Your pig fiance is too late. A few more
steps and we’ll be safe in the Fire Swamp.</p>
<p><strong>buttercup</strong>: We’ll never survive.</p>
<p><strong>westley</strong>: Nonsense – you’re only saying that because
no one ever has.</p>
<p><strong>westley</strong>: It’s not that bad. I’m not saying I’d like
to build a summer home here, but the trees are actually quite
lovely.</p>
<p><strong>westley</strong>: Well now, that was an adventure.</p>
<p><strong>westley</strong>: Singed a bit, were you?</p>
<p><strong>buttercup</strong>: You?</p>
<p><strong>westley</strong>: Well, one thing I will say. The Fire Swamp
certainly does keep you on your toes.</p>
<p><strong>westley</strong>: This will all soon be but a happy memory
because Roberts’ ship “Revenge” is anchored at the far end. And I, as
you know, am Roberts.</p>
<p><strong>buttercup</strong>: But how is that possible, since he’s been
marauding twenty years and you only left me five years ago?</p>
<p><strong>westley</strong>: I myself am often surprised at life’s
little quirks.</p>
<p><strong>westley</strong>: You see, what I told you before about
saying “please” was true. It intrigued Roberts, as did my descriptions
of your beauty.</p>
<p><strong>westley</strong>: Finally, Roberts decided something. He
said, “All right, Westley, I’ve never had a valet. You can try it for
tonight. I’ll most likely kill you in the morning.” Three years he said
that. “Good night, Westley. Good work. Sleep well. I’ll most likely kill
you in the morning.” It was a fine time for me. I was learning to fence,
to fight, anything anyone would teach me. And Roberts and I eventually
became friends. And then it happened.</p>
<p><strong>buttercup</strong>: What? – go on –</p>
<p><strong>westley</strong>: Well, Roberts had grown so rich, he wanted
to retire. So he took me to his cabin and told me his secret. “I am not
the Dread Pirate Roberts,” he said. “My name is Ryan. I inherited this
ship from the previous Dread Pirate Roberts, just as you will inherit it
from me. The man I inherited it from was not the real Dread Pirate
Roberts, either.</p>
<p>****: ————————————————————————— 60.</p>
<p><strong>westley</strong>: His name was Cummerbund. The real Roberts
has been retired fifteen years and living like a king in Patagonia.”
Then he explained the name was the important thing for inspiring the
necessary fear. You see, no one would surrender to the Dread Pirate
Westley.</p>
<p><strong>westley</strong>: So we sailed ashore, took on an entirely
new crew and he stayed aboard for awhile as first mate, all the time
calling me Roberts. Once the crew believed, he left the ship and I have
been Roberts ever since. Except, now that we’re together, I shall retire
and hand the name over to someone else. Is everything clear to you?</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: ————————————————————————— 61.</p>
<p><strong>buttercup</strong>: We’ll never succeed – we may as well die
here.</p>
<p><strong>westley</strong>: No. No. We have already succeeded.</p>
<p><strong>westley</strong>: I mean, what are the three terrors of the
Fire Swamp? One, the flame spurts. No problem. There’s a popping sound
preceding each, we can avoid that. Two, the Lightning Sand. But you were
clever enough to discover what that looks like, so in the future we can
avoid that too.</p>
<p><strong>buttercup</strong>: Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.’s?</p>
<p><strong>westley</strong>: Rodents of Unusual Size? I don’t think they
exist…</p>
<p><strong>buttercup</strong>: Westley!</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: ————————————————————————— 63.</p>
<p><strong>buttercup</strong>: We did it.</p>
<p><strong>westley</strong>: Now, was that so terrible?</p>
<p><strong>humperdinck</strong>: Surrender!</p>
<p><strong>westley</strong>: You mean you wish to surrender to me? Very
well, I accept.</p>
<p><strong>humperdinck</strong>: I give you full marks for bravery
–don’t make yourself a fool.</p>
<p><strong>westley</strong>: Ah, but how will you capture us? We know
the secrets of the Fire Swamp. We can live there quite happily for some
time. So, whenever you feel like dying, feel free to visit.</p>
<p><strong>humperdinck</strong>: I tell you once again – surrender!</p>
<p><strong>westley</strong>: It will not happen!</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: ————————————————————————— 65.</p>
<p><strong>humperdinck</strong>: For the last time – SURRENDER!</p>
<p><strong>buttercup</strong>: Will you promise not to hurt him?</p>
<p><strong>humperdinck</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>westley</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>buttercup</strong>: If we surrender, and I return with you,
will you promise not to hurt this man?</p>
<p><strong>humperdinck</strong>: May I live a thousand years and never
hunt again.</p>
<p><strong>buttercup</strong>: He is a sailor on the pirate ship
“Revenge.” Promise to return him to his ship.</p>
<p><strong>humperdinck</strong>: I swear it will be done.</p>
<p><strong>humperdinck</strong>: Once we’re out of sight, take him back
to Florin and throw him in the Pit of Despair.</p>
<p><strong>rugen</strong>: I swear it will be done.</p>
<p><strong>buttercup</strong>: I thought you were dead once, and it
almost destroyed me. I could not bear it if you died again, not when I
could save you.</p>
<p><strong>rugen</strong>: Come, sir. We must get you to your ship.</p>
<p><strong>westley</strong>: We are men of action. Lies do not become
us.</p>
<p><strong>rugen</strong>: Well spoken, sir –</p>
<p><strong>rugen</strong>: – what is it?</p>
<p><strong>westley</strong>: You have six fingers on your right hand –
someone was looking for you –</p>
<p><strong>westley</strong>: Where am I?</p>
<p><strong>albino</strong>: The Pit of Despair.</p>
<p><strong>albino</strong>: Don’t even think – – don’t even think about
trying to escape. The chains are far too thick. And don’t dream of being
rescued either. The only way in is secret. And only the Prince, the
Count, and I know how to get in and out.</p>
<p><strong>westley</strong>: Then I’m here till I die?</p>
<p><strong>albino</strong>: Till they kill you. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>westley</strong>: Then why bother curing me?</p>
<p><strong>albino</strong>: The Prince and the Count always insist on
everyone being healthy before they’re broken.</p>
<p><strong>westley</strong>: So it’s to be torture.</p>
<p><strong>westley</strong>: I can cope with torture.</p>
<p><strong>westley</strong>: You don’t believe me?</p>
<p><strong>albino</strong>: You survived the Fire Swamp. You must be
very brave… … but nobody withstands The Machine.</p>
<p><strong>humperdinck</strong>: She’s been like that ever since the
Fire Swamp. It’s my father’s failing health that’s upsetting her.</p>
<p><strong>rugen</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: The King died that very night, and
before the following dawn, Buttercup and Humperdinck were married.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: And at noon, she met her subjects
again. This time as their Queen.</p>
<p><strong>humperdinck</strong>: My father’s final words were…</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: – hold it. Hold it, Grandpa.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: You read that wrong. She doesn’t marry
Humperdinck, she marries Westley. I’m just sure of it. After all that
Westley did for her, if she does not marry him, it wouldn’t be fair.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Well, who says life is fair? Where is
that written? Life isn’t always fair.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: I’m telling you you’re messing up the
story, now get it right!</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Do you want me to go on with this?</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: All right, then. No more interruptions.
… at noon, she met her subjects again. This time as their Queen.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: ————————————————————————— 71.</p>
<p><strong>humperdinck</strong>: My father’s final words were “love her
as I loved her, and there will be joy.” I present to you your Queen.
Queen Buttercup.</p>
<p><strong>buttercup</strong>: Why do you do this?</p>
<p><strong>ancient booer</strong>: Because you had love in your hands,
and you gave it up.</p>
<p><strong>buttercup</strong>: But they would have killed Westley if I
hadn’t done it.</p>
<p><strong>ancient booer</strong>: Your true love lives and you marry
another – – True love saved her in the Fire Swamp, and she treated it
like garbage. And that’s what she is, the Queen of Refuse! So, bow down
to her if you want. Bow to her. Bow to the Queen of Slime, the Queen of
Filth, the Queen of Putrescence. Boo! Boo! Rubbish! Filth! Slime! Muck!
Boo! Boo!</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: It was ten days till the wedding. The
King still lived, but Buttercup’s nightmares were growing steadily
worse.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: See? Didn’t I tell you she’d never marry
that rotten Humperdinck?</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: – yes, you’re very smart. Shut-Up.</p>
<p><strong>buttercup</strong>: It comes to this: I love Westley. I
always have. I know now I always will. If you tell me I must marry you
in ten days, please believe I will be dead by morning.</p>
<p><strong>humperdinck</strong>: I could never cause you grief; consider
our wedding off. You returned this Westley to his ship?</p>
<p><strong>rugen</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>humperdinck</strong>: Then we will simply alert him. Beloved,
are you certain he still wants you? After all, it was you who did the
leaving in the Fire Swamp. Not to mention that pirates are not known to
be men of their words.</p>
<p><strong>buttercup</strong>: My Westley will always come for me.</p>
<p><strong>humperdinck</strong>: I suggest a deal. You write four copies
of a letter. I’ll send my four fastest ships. One in each direction. The
Dread Pirate Roberts is always close to Florin this time of year. We’ll
run up the white flag and deliver your message. If Westley wants you,
bless you both. If not … please consider me as an alternative to
suicide. Are we agreed?</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: ————————————————————————— 74.</p>
<p><strong>rugen</strong>: Your Princess is really a winning creature. A
trifle simple, perhaps, but her appeal is undeniable.</p>
<p><strong>humperdinck</strong>: Oh, I know. The people are quite taken
with her. It’s odd, but when I hired Vizzini to have her murdered on our
engagement day, I thought that was clever. But it’s going to be so much
more moving when I strangle her on our wedding night. Once Guilder is
blamed, the nation will be truly outraged. They’ll demand we go to
war.</p>
<p><strong>rugen</strong>: Now, where is that secret knot? It’s
impossible to find. Are you coming down into the Pit? Westley’s got his
strength back. I am starting him on The Machine tonight.</p>
<p><strong>humperdinck</strong>: Tyrone, you know how much I love
watching you work. But, I’ve got my country’s five hundredth anniversary
to plan, my wedding to arrange, My wife to murder, and Guilder to frame
for it. I’m swamped.</p>
<p><strong>rugen</strong>: Get some rest – if you haven’t got your
health, you haven’t got anything.</p>
<p><strong>rugen</strong>: Beautiful, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>rugen</strong>: It took me half a lifetime to invent it. I’m
sure you’ve discovered my deep and abiding interest in pain. At present
I’m writing the definitive work on the subject. So I want you to be
totally honest with me on how The Machine makes you feel.</p>
<p><strong>rugen</strong>: This being our first try, I’ll use the lowest
setting.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: ————————————————————————— 76.</p>
<p><strong>rugen</strong>: As you know, the concept of the suction pump
is centuries old. Well, really, that’s all this is. Except that instead
of sucking water, I’m sucking life. I’ve just sucked one year of your
life away. I might one day go as high as five, but I really don’t know
what that would do to you. So, let’s just start with what we have. What
did this do to you? Tell me. And remember, this is for posterity, so be
honest – how do you feel?</p>

trust you with this secret: killers from Guilder are infiltrating the
Thieves’ Forest and plan to murder my bride on our wedding night.</p>
<p><strong>yellin</strong>: My spy network has heard no such news.</p>
<p><strong>buttercup</strong>: Any word from Westley?</p>
<p><strong>humperdinck</strong>: Too soon, my angel. Patience.</p>
<p><strong>buttercup</strong>: He will come for me.</p>
<p><strong>humperdinck</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>humperdinck</strong>: She will not be murdered. On the day of
the wedding, I want the Thieves’ Forest emptied and every inhabitant
arrested.</p>
<p><strong>yellin</strong>: Many of the thieves will resist. My regular
enforcers will be inadequate.</p>
<p><strong>humperdinck</strong>: Form a Brute Squad then. I want the
Thieves’ Forest emptied before I wed.</p>
<p><strong>yellin</strong>: It won’t be easy, Sire.</p>
<p><strong>humperdinck</strong>: Try ruling the world sometime.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: The day of the wedding arrived. The
Brute Squad had their hands full carrying out Humperdinck’s orders.</p>
<p><strong>yellin</strong>: Is everybody out?</p>
<p><strong>assistant brute</strong>: Almost. There’s a Spaniard giving
us some trouble.</p>
<p><strong>yellin</strong>: Well, you give him some trouble. Move!</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: I am waiting for you, Vizzini. You told me to
go back to the beginning. So I have. This is where I am, and this is
where I’ll stay. I will not be moved.</p>
<p><strong>assistant brute</strong>: Ho there.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: I do not budge. Keep your “Ho there.”</p>
<p><strong>assistant brute</strong>: But the Prince gave orders –</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: – So did Vizzini – when a job went wrong, you
went back to the beginning. And this is where we got the job. So it’s
the beginning, and I’m staying till Vizzini comes.</p>
<p><strong>assistant brute</strong>: You! Brute! Come here.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: – I – am – waiting – for – Vizzini –</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You surely are a meanie.</p>
<p><strong>fezzik</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: It’s you.</p>
<p><strong>fezzik</strong>: True!</p>
<p><strong>fezzik</strong>: You don’t look so good. You don’t smell so
good either.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: Perhaps not. I feel fine.</p>
<p><strong>fezzik</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: FEZZIK and Inigo were reunited. And as
FEZZIK nursed his inebriated friend back to health, he told Inigo of
Vizzini’s death and the existence of Count Rugen, the sixfingered man.
Considering Inigo’s lifelong search, he handled the news surprisingly
well.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Fezzik took great care in reviving
Inigo.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: That’s enough. That’s enough! Where is this
Rugen so I may kill him?</p>
<p><strong>fezzik</strong>: He’s with the Prince in the Castle. But the
castle gate is guarded by thirty men.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: How many could you handle?</p>
<p><strong>fezzik</strong>: I don’t think more than ten.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: That leaves twenty for me. At my best, I
could never defeat that many. I need Vizzini to plan. I have no gift for
strategy.</p>
<p><strong>fezzik</strong>: But Vizzini’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: No – not Vizzini – I need the Man in Black
–</p>
<p><strong>fezzik</strong>: – what? –</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: – look, he bested you with strength, your
greatness. He bested me with steel. He must have outthought Vizzini, and
a man who can do that can plan my castle’s onslaught any day. Let’s go
–</p>
<p><strong>fezzik</strong>: – where?</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: To find the Man in Black, obviously.</p>
<p><strong>fezzik</strong>: But you don’t know where he is.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: Don’t bother me with trifles; after twenty
years, at last, my father’s soul will be at peace.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: There will be blood tonight!!</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: ————————————————————————— 83.</p>
<p><strong>humperdinck</strong>: Rise and report.</p>
<p><strong>yellin</strong>: The Thieves’ Forest is emptied. Thirty men
guard the castle gate.</p>
<p><strong>humperdinck</strong>: Double it. My Princess must be
safe.</p>
<p><strong>yellin</strong>: The gate has but one key, and I carry
that.</p>
<p><strong>humperdinck</strong>: Ah! My dulcet darling. Tonight we
marry. Tomorrow morning, your men will escort us to Florin Channel where
every ship in my armada waits to accompany us on our honeymoon.</p>
<p><strong>buttercup</strong>: Every ship but your four fastest, you
mean.</p>
<p><strong>buttercup</strong>: Every ship but the four you sent.</p>
<p><strong>humperdinck</strong>: Yes. Yes, of course. Naturally, not
those four.</p>
<p><strong>yellin</strong>: Your Majesties.</p>
<p><strong>buttercup</strong>: You never sent the ships. Don’t bother
lying. It doesn’t matter. Westley will come for me anyway.</p>
<p><strong>humperdinck</strong>: You’re a silly girl.</p>
<p><strong>buttercup</strong>: Yes, I am a silly girl, for not having
seen sooner that you were nothing but a coward with a heart full of
fear.</p>
<p><strong>humperdinck</strong>: I-would-not-say-such things-if-
Iwere-you-</p>
<p><strong>buttercup</strong>: Why not? You can’t hurt me. Westley and I
are joined by the bonds of love. And you cannot track that. Not with a
thousand bloodhounds. And you cannot break it. Not with a thousand
swords. And when I say you are a coward, that is only because you are
the slimiest weakling ever to crawl the earth.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: ————————————————————————— 85.</p>
<p><strong>humperdinck</strong>: You truly love each other, and so you
might have been truly happy. Not one couple in a century has that
chance, no matter what the storybooks say. And so I think no man in a
century will suffer as greatly as you will.</p>

<p><strong>inigo</strong>: – Fezzik, please –</p>
<p><strong>fezzik</strong>: Everybody … MOVE!!</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: Where is the Man in Black?</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: You get there from this grove, yes?</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: Fezzik, jog his memory.</p>
<p><strong>fezzik</strong>: I’m sorry, Inigo. I didn’t mean to jog him
so hard. Inigo?</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: Father, I have failed you for twenty years.
Now our misery can end. Somewhere … somewhere close by is a man who can
help us. I cannot find him alone. I need you. I need you to guide my
sword. Please.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: Guide my sword.</p>
<p><strong>fezzik</strong>: He’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: It just is not fair.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: – Grandpa, Grandpa – wait –</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: – wait – what did FEZZIK mean, “He’s dead?”
I mean he didn’t mean dead.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Westley’s only faking, right?</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: You want me to read this or not?</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Who gets Humperdinck?</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Who kills Prince Humperdinck? At the end,
somebody’s got to do it. Is it Inigo? Who?</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Nobody. Nobody kills him. He lives.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: You mean he wins? Jesus, Grandpa! What did
you read me this thing for?</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: You know, you’ve been very sick and
you’re taking this story very seriously. I think we better stop now.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: No! I’m okay. I’m okay. – sit down. All
right?</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Okay. All right, now, let’s see. Where
were we? Oh yes. In the Pit of Despair.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: Well, we Montoyas have never taken defeat
easily. Come along, Fezzik. Bring the body.</p>
<p><strong>fezzik</strong>: The body?</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: Have you any money?</p>
<p><strong>fezzik</strong>: I have a little.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: I just hope it’s enough to buy a miracle,
that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>little old guy</strong>: Go away!</p>
<p><strong>miracle max</strong>: What? What?</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: Are you the Miracle Max who worked for the
King all those years?</p>
<p><strong>miracle max</strong>: The King’s stinking son fired me. And
thank you so much for bringing up such a painful subject. While you’re
at it, why don’t you give me a nice paper cut and pour lemon juice on
it? We’re closed!</p>
<p><strong>miracle max</strong>: Beat it or I’ll call the Brute
Squad.</p>
<p><strong>fezzik</strong>: I’m on the Brute Squad.</p>
<p><strong>miracle max</strong>: You are the Brute Squad.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: We need a miracle. It’s very important.</p>
<p><strong>miracle max</strong>: Look, I’m retired. And besides, why
would you want someone the King’s stinking son fired? I might kill
whoever you wanted me to miracle.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: He’s already dead.</p>
<p><strong>miracle max</strong>: He is, eh? I’ll take a look. Bring him
in.</p>
<p><strong>miracle max</strong>: I’ve seen worse.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: Sir. Sir.</p>
<p><strong>miracle max</strong>: Hah?</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: We’re really in a terrible rush.</p>
<p><strong>miracle max</strong>: Don’t rush me, sonny. You rush a
miracle man, you get rotten miracles. You got money?</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: Sixty-five.</p>
<p><strong>miracle max</strong>: Sheesh! I never worked for so little,
except once, and that was a very noble cause.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: This is noble, sir. His wife is crippled. His
children are on the brink of starvation.</p>
<p><strong>miracle max</strong>: Are you a rotten liar.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: I need him to help avenge my father, murdered
these twenty years.</p>
<p><strong>miracle max</strong>: Your first story was better. Where’s
that bellows? He probably owes you money, huh? Well, I’ll ask him.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: He’s dead. He can’t talk.</p>
<p><strong>miracle max</strong>: Look who knows so much. Well, it just
so happens that your friend here is only mostly dead. There’s a big
difference between mostly dead and all dead. Please open his mouth.</p>
<p><strong>miracle max</strong>: Now, mostly dead is slightly alive.
Now, all dead…well, with all dead, there’s usually only one thing that
you can do.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>miracle max</strong>: Go through his clothes and look for
loose change.</p>
<p><strong>miracle max</strong>: Hey! Hello in there. Hey! What’s so
important? What you got here that’s worth living for?</p>
<p><strong>westley</strong>: … tr … oooo …. luv…</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: True love. You heard him. You could not ask
for a more noble cause than that.</p>
<p><strong>miracle max</strong>: Sonny, true love is the greatest thing
in the world. Except for a nice MLT, a mutton, lettuce and tomato
sandwich, where the mutton is nice and lean and the tomato is ripe.
They’re so perky, I love that. But that’s not what he said. He
distinctly said “to blave.” And, as we all know, “to blave” means “to
bluff.” So you’re probably playing cards, and he cheated</p>
<p><strong>a woman’s voice</strong>: – Liar – LIAR-LI-A-A-AR –</p>
<p><strong>miracle max</strong>: – get back, witch –</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: I’m not a witch, I’m your wife. But after
what you just said, I’m not even sure I want to be that anymore.</p>
<p><strong>miracle max</strong>: You never had it so good.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: “True love.” He said, “true love,” Max. My
God –</p>
<p><strong>miracle max</strong>: Don’t say another word, Valerie.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: He’s afraid. Ever since Prince Humperdinck
fired him, his confidence is shattered.</p>
<p><strong>miracle max</strong>: Why’d you say that name – you promised
me that you would never say that name –</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: What, Humperdinck? Humperdinck.
Humperdinck. Ooo-ooo, Humperdinck</p>
<p><strong>miracle max</strong>: I’m not listening.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: A life expiring and you don’t have the
decency to say why you won’t help –</p>
<p><strong>miracle max</strong>: Nobody’s hearing nothing!</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Humperdinck. Humperdinck! Humperdinck!</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: – But this is Buttercup’s true love – If you
heal him, he will stop Humperdinck’s wedding.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Humperdinck. Humperdinck –</p>
<p><strong>miracle max</strong>: Shut up – Wait. Wait. I make him
better, Humperdinck suffers?</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: Humiliations galore!</p>
<p><strong>miracle max</strong>: That is a noble cause. Give me the
sixty-five, I’m on the job.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: That’s a miracle pill?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: The chocolate coating makes it go down
easier. But you have to wait fifteen minutes for full potency. And you
shouldn’t go swimming after, for at least, what?</p>
<p><strong>miracle max</strong>: An hour.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Yeah, an hour.</p>
<p><strong>miracle max</strong>: A good hour. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: Thank you for everything.</p>
<p><strong>miracle max</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Bye-bye, boys.</p>
<p><strong>miracle max</strong>: Have fun storming the castle.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Think it’ll work?</p>
<p><strong>miracle max</strong>: It would take a miracle. Bye!</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Bye.</p>
<p><strong>fezzik</strong>: Inigo – there’s more than thirty –</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: What’s the difference? We’ve got him. Help me
here. We’ll have to force feed him.</p>
<p><strong>fezzik</strong>: Has it been fifteen minutes?</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: We can’t wait – the wedding’s in half an hour
and we must strike in the hustle and the bustle beforehand.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: Tilt his head back. Open his mouth.</p>
<p><strong>fezzik</strong>: How long do we have to wait before we know
if the miracle works?</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: Your guess is as good as mine –</p>
<p><strong>westley</strong>: I’ll beat you both apart. I’ll take you
both together.</p>
<p><strong>fezzik</strong>: Guess not very long.</p>
<p><strong>westley</strong>: Why won’t my arms move?</p>
<p><strong>fezzik</strong>: You’ve been mostly dead all day.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: We had Miracle Max make a pill to bring you
back.</p>
<p><strong>westley</strong>: Who are you? – Are we enemies? Why am I on
this wall? – Where’s Buttercup? –</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: Let me explain – – No, there is too much. Let
me sum up.</p>
<p>****: ————————————————————————— 99.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: Buttercup is marrying Humperdinck in a little
less than half an hour, so all we have to do is get in, break up the
wedding, steal the Princess, make our escape after I kill Count
Rugen.</p>
<p><strong>westley</strong>: That doesn’t leave much time for dilly
dallying.</p>
<p><strong>fezzik</strong>: You’ve just wiggled your finger. That’s
wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>westley</strong>: I’ve always been a quick healer. What are
our liabilities?</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: There is but one working castle gate.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: And it is guarded by sixty men.</p>
<p><strong>westley</strong>: And our assets?</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: Your brains, Fezzik’s strength, my steel.</p>
<p><strong>westley</strong>: That’s it? Impossible. If I had a month to
plan, maybe I could come up with something. But this…</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: ————————————————————————— 100.</p>
<p><strong>fezzik</strong>: You just shook your head – that doesn’t make
you happy?</p>
<p><strong>westley</strong>: My brains, his steel, and your strength
against sixty men, and you think a little head jiggle is supposed to
make me happy? I mean, if we only had a wheelbarrow, that would be
something.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: Where did we put that wheelbarrow the Albino
had?</p>
<p><strong>fezzik</strong>: Over the Albino, I think.</p>
<p><strong>westley</strong>: Well, why didn’t you list that among our
assets in the first place? What I wouldn’t give for a holocaust
cloak.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: There we cannot help you.</p>
<p><strong>fezzik</strong>: Will this do?</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: Where did you get that?</p>
<p><strong>fezzik</strong>: At Miracle Max’s. It fit so nice, he said I
could keep it.</p>
<p><strong>westley</strong>: All right, all right. Come on, help me
up.</p>
<p><strong>westley</strong>: Now, I’ll need a sword eventually.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: Why? You can’t even lift one.</p>
<p><strong>westley</strong>: True, but that’s hardly common knowledge,
is it? Thank you. Now, there may be problems once we’re inside.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: I’ll say – how do I find the Count? – Once I
do, how do I find you again? – Once I find you again, how do we escape?
–</p>
<p><strong>fezzik</strong>: Don’t pester him, he’s had a hard day.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: Right, right, sorry.</p>

<p><strong>inigo</strong>: Shall I dispatch him for you?</p>
<p><strong>westley</strong>: Thank you, but no – whatever happens to us,
I want him to live a long life alone with his cowardice.</p>
<p><strong>fezzik</strong>: Inigo! Inigo, where are you?</p>
<p><strong>fezzik</strong>: Ah, there you are. Inigo, I saw the Prince’s
stables, and there they were, four white horses. And I thought, there
are four of us, if we ever find the lad – hello, lad – so I took them
with me, in case we ever bumped into each other. I guess we just
did.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: FEZZIK, you did something right.</p>
<p><strong>fezzik</strong>: Don’t worry – I won’t let it go to my
head.</p>
<p><strong>inigo</strong>: You know, it’s very strange – I have been in
the revenge business so long, now that it’s over, I don’t know what to
do with the rest of my life.</p>
<p><strong>westley</strong>: Have you ever considered piracy? You’d make
a wonderful Dread Pirate Roberts.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: They rode to freedom. And as dawn

<p><strong>the kid</strong>: What? What?</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: No, it’s kissing again. You don’t want
to hear it.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: I don’t mind so much.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Since the invention of the kiss, there
have been five kisses that were rated the most passionate, the most
pure. This one left them all behind. The end.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Now I think you ought to go to
sleep.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. So
long.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Grandpa?</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Maybe you could come over and read it again
to me tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: As you wish…</p>
