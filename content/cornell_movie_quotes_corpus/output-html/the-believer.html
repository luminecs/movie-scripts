<h1 id="the-believer">the-believer</h1>
<p><strong>rav zingesser</strong>: “And God said to Abraham, ’Take your
son, your only son, whom you love, Isaac, and go into the land of Moriah
and offer him there for a sacrifice upon a mountain that I will show
you…”</p>
<p><strong>rav zingesser</strong>: And why did the Holy One – blessed be
He – do this? Why did he ask Abraham to sacrifice his only son, whom he
loved?</p>
<p><strong>12-year-old danny</strong>: Isaac wasn’t his only son.
Ishmael was his son, too.</p>
<p><strong>12-year-old avi</strong>: The only son he loved.</p>
<p><strong>12-year-old danny</strong>: Oh, they only kill them when they
love them…?</p>
<p><strong>12-year-old stuart</strong>: It was a test of Abraham’s
faith. Of his devotion to God.</p>
<p><strong>12-year-old danny</strong>: It’s not about Abraham’s faith.
It’s about God’s power. God says, “You know how powerful I am? I can
make you do anything I want, no matter how stupid. Even kill your own
son. Because I’m everything, you’re nothing.”</p>
<p><strong>rav zingesser</strong>: But, Danny, if HaShem is everything,
and we are nothing how are we to judge His actions?</p>
<p><strong>12-year-old danny</strong>: We have free will and
intelligence – which God allegedly gave us….</p>
<p><strong>avi</strong>: Anyway, God never lets Abraham kill Isaac. He
provides the ram so that –</p>
<p><strong>12-year-old danny</strong>: Personally, I think that’s a lie.
I think he did kill him.</p>
<p><strong>rav zingesser</strong>: You think?! Based on what?</p>
<p><strong>12-year-old danny</strong>: There’s midrash supporting this.
My father read a book by Shalom Spiegel that – Isaac actually died and
was reborn.</p>
<p><strong>rav zingesser</strong>: No one follows that midrash.</p>
<p><strong>12-year-old danny</strong>: I do; I follow it. But okay, say
God provided the ram. So what? Once Abraham raised the knife, in his
heart it was as if he’d killed him. He could never forget that. And
neither could Isaac. Look at him: he’s traumatized, he’s a putz for the
rest of his life. By the end he can’t tell Jacob from Esau….</p>
<p><strong>rav zingesser</strong>: Watch your language….</p>
<p><strong>12-year-old danny</strong>: I think the whole Jewish people
were permanently scarred by what happened on Mt. Moriah, and we still
live in terror….</p>
<p><strong>12-year-old stuart</strong>: Fear of God is the beginning of
wisdom.</p>
<p><strong>12-year-old danny</strong>: Fear of God makes you afraid of
everything. All the Jews are good at is being afraid. And being
sacrificed.</p>
<p><strong>12-year-old stuart</strong>: Don’t you believe in God?</p>
<p><strong>12-year-old danny</strong>: I’m the only one here who does
believe. You say he’s mysterious, yet merciful. I see him for the power-
drunk madman He is. And we’re supposed to worship such a Deity?? I say
Never! I say…fight him. I say –</p>
<p><strong>rav zingesser</strong>: Avi – ask Rabbi Springer to come
remove Danny from the class….</p>
<p><strong>rav zingesser</strong>: And you, if you had come out of
Egypt, you would have been destroyed in the desert with those who
worshipped the Golden Calf.</p>
<p><strong>12-year-old danny</strong>: Then let Him destroy me now. Let
Him crush me like the conceited bully He is. Go ahead. Kill me. Here I
am. Do it!!</p>
<p><strong>reverse angle</strong>: another YOUNG MAN, standing – a
“SUEDE-HEAD” .</p>
<p><strong>suede-head’s pov</strong>: THE JEWISH BOY pushes his glasses
back up his nose, wipes the nose with a handkerchief, puts the
handkerchief away, and all the time his eyes have not left the page.
Suede-head steps between passengers and stands directly over the Jewish
boy. He looks down at the yarmulke pinned to the stiff, wavy hair, at
the oversized shirt collar, scrawny neck, prominent Adam’s apple,
pimples, dandruff, ingrown facial hair…</p>
<p><strong>suede-head</strong>: Fucking kike.</p>
<p><strong>suede-head</strong>: Get up…. Get the fuck up….</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Is this working? I’m trying to reach
Danny Balint…Danny, it’s Vicki, we met at Happy Jack’s last month…?</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: I was hoping maybe we could…get
together again… Give me a call – 718-555-0193.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: …Is it completely vegetarian? …What do they
make the stock from?… Not chicken, you’re sure?… And no dairy… No, no
cheese I don’t eat cheese… Yeah, all right. And the tropical fruit
shake… How long?…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Vodka tonic.</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: …So she takes the pants in back – where
they try them on? And I think fuck it….</p>
<p><strong>carleton</strong>: Are you shitting me?? Right in the
store?</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: She’s been giving me the eye. She’s hot.
So I wait till the owner goes up front….</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: What are you doing??</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What do you think you’re doing?</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: Who the fuck are you?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Who am I?? Who are you, you schmucks, you
can’t even make a decent swastika…. Give me the paint. Give it to
me.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: It’s too squared off. You got to orient it up
and down, diamond-shaped, like this…. …The arms go clockwise. You’re
going to Curtis Zampf; me, too. Let’s go?</p>
<p><strong>curtis zampf</strong>: …Where I grew up in South Boston
twenty years ago, when a kid walked down the street, everyone knew who
he was…</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: …If he ran out in front of a car, some old
Mick’d yell at him, “Jimmy Dunne, get back on that sidewalk and stay
there….”</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: …The day he graduated high school, he’d go
see his uncle down at the gas works, or the priest’s brother in the
shipyard, get his apprentice papers, eight years later he’d be making
$16.50 an hour, have four kids, play ball on Sundays in Columbus Park,
and when he died, the whole town’d get drunk and cry over him….</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: …Today, when that kid walks down the street
it’s full of trash and half the faces are black. The shipyard’s closed,
all the jobs at the gas works are set-asides, and by the time he drops
out of school, he can barely get a job at Burger King. So he drinks,
smokes crack, and when he hangs himself on the front porch at
twenty-three, the only people at his wake are a couple of buddies and
his mother. The boy’s father won’t find out he’s dead till six months
later. The soul of this country is being destroyed, and all the
government can offer is free trade, mutual funds and IPOs.</p>
<p><strong>guy danielsen</strong>: You sound like a leftist.</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: I used to be one…. No, seriously, I called
myself an anarchist. I stood up for the oppressed. I opposed state
power.</p>
<p><strong>an old coot</strong>: Don’t you still?</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: I oppose the present state because it’s
weak. It has been ever since the left emasculated it over Vietnam. But I
think the average man is crushed less by accumulated capital than the
loss of community or real leadership, the personal emptiness he simply
cannot fill on his own…. That’s why I’m a fascist. It’s the only form of
government that addresses our deepest needs.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What do you think the fascism of the
twenty-first century will look like?</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: More cultural than political.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Obviously.</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: Decentralized, nonviolent, increasingly
mainstream. We’ll see antiabortion, anti-immigration groups form
alliances with the gun lobby, Christian identity types, tax resisters
and even some libertarians….</p>
<p><strong>old coot</strong>: What about race?</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: This isn’t the time for that.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I disagree. I think race is central to
everything we’re talking about. Spiritual life comes from race. From the
blood. Without that, we’re no better than the Jews….</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: What’s wrong with the Jews?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. moebius</strong>: Carla…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Have you read Toynbee? Spengler?</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Nobody reads that stuff anymore.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Too difficult?</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Too Christian. You know Jameson? Paul
Virilio?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: The point is, the modern world is a Jewish
disease.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Disease? What disease?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Abstraction. They’re obsessed with
abstraction.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: What would you propose?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Killing Jews.</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: That would be a catastrophic mistake.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: People hate Jews. Do you agree?</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: They used to. Today it’s not an issue.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: No, but deep down, beneath the “tolerance”
they learn on television, nothing’s changed. The very word makes their
skin crawl. It isn’t even hate, really. It’s more the way we feel when a
rat runs across the floor. We want to step on it. Crush it. We don’t
even know why. It’s a physical reaction. Everyone feels it.</p>
<p><strong>guy danielsen</strong>: Which ones would you kill?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Prominent Jews. Who are either symbols in
themselves or who represent aspects of the Jewish character people
despise.</p>
<p><strong>guy danielsen</strong>: Such as?</p>
<p><strong>old coot</strong>: Barbra Streisand.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Too obvious.</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: Kissinger…Dershowitz…Roseanne…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yes. And Larry King…</p>
<p><strong>old coot</strong>: Is he Jewish?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: …Leona Helmsley, Michael Eisner, Bob Dylan,
Phillip Roth, Ruth Bader Ginsberg, Steven Spielberg, Winona Ryder,
Beverly Sills, Alvin Toffler, Katherine Graham. All of them. But not
yet. We don’t want celebrity obscuring the issue.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Which is what?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: At first, no one will know why the victims
are being killed.</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: You wouldn’t announce it?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I’d say nothing. After two or three, people
will try to find a pattern. A reason.</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: But when it comes out, the public will be
outraged. It will look like Germany all over again.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Isn’t that what we want? Germany all over
again? Only done right this time…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Without speeches or political parties. A
movement without leaders so that no one can stop it…</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: Okay, let’s break this up for now…. Could
you wait a minute…?</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: …I thought we agreed, no anti- Semitism…it’s
exactly what we’re trying to put behind us…. Trash the blacks, fine;
but…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. moebius</strong>: Did you see how they reacted to
him?</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: Yes, of course. But that only plays in this
room, with people who aren’t embarrassed to call themselves Nazis. If
you want a modern fascism, you don’t mention Jews.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. moebius</strong>: It’s a romantic movement, Curtis. It
always has been.</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: Lina, the Thousand-Year Reich barely lasted
a decade…. Do you really want to go down that road again? In America of
all places, where obedience and discipline are not exactly the national
virtues…</p>
<p><strong>lina</strong>: He’s very bright.</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: He speaks well. But what do we do with
him?</p>
<p><strong>lina</strong>: Let’s find out who he is.</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: You mean who he really is.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: You’re not in school? What do you do?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I work at the Big Boy warehouse. In Queens. I
drive a fork-lift.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Where’d you read all that stuff?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I just read it….</p>
<p><strong>lina</strong>: Young man…</p>
<p><strong>lina</strong>: Lina Moebius. And you are…?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Daniel Balint.</p>
<p><strong>lina</strong>: Balint?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: It’s German.</p>
<p><strong>lina</strong>: What part of Germany are you people from?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: From the Rhineland originally.</p>
<p><strong>lina</strong>: Are you with the FBI, Mr. Balint?… Or any
other law enforcement agency?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I was going to ask you the same thing.</p>
<p><strong>lina</strong>: So what are you really after, Daniel?… Do you
just want to kill Jews, or do you have something larger in mind?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Without blood – a willingness to spill it –
there’s no real power, no authority.</p>
<p><strong>lina</strong>: Curtis is afraid you’ll marginalize us.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: We’re already marginal. We are saying what no
one else has the guts to say. Isn’t that precisely our appeal?</p>
<p><strong>lina</strong>: So what Jew would you kill first?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Ilio Manzetti…former ambassador to France.
Managing partner at Damon, Schwarzchild.</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: An investment banking house.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. moebius</strong>: He’s Jewish? Manzetti?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Totally. The family emigrated from Bulgaria
when he was eleven.</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: How would you kill him?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I’d have to research it, study his routines,
his security…. But ideally on a New York street at midday, using a
small-caliber automatic without a silencer.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Why no silencer?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You want it to be an event.</p>
<p><strong>lina</strong>: Danny, why don’t you come visit us in the
country. We have young men with lots of energy and no ideas. Maybe you
could give them something to think about…. Bring your friends, if you
like….</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: Bring your friends…. We’re not his
friends.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Then I won’t bring you….</p>
<p><strong>black voice</strong>: Hey, bonehead…get your moon ass off the
street.</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: Why don’t you go back to Rwanda and give
each other AIDS.</p>
<p><strong>o.l.</strong>: I can’t see….</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: What, do you like it here?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Read Mein Kampf? Hitler had all his best
ideas in prison.</p>
<p><strong>off-screen voice</strong>: Daniel Balint?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I’m not leaving without them.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Can I use a credit card?</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: He should go to a hospital.</p>
<p><strong>o.l.</strong>: I’m okay.</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: You coming?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: We’ll go to the country sometime, okay?</p>
<p><strong>carleton</strong>: Fucking Danny, man…</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: He’s an asshole.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: “…und die Worte zerfielen mir im Munde wie
modrige Pilze…”</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: “And the words fell apart in my mouth like
moldering mushrooms…”</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: How come so many of the books are in
Spanish?</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: They’re my father’s. He’s from Argentina. My
mother’s family went there during the war. That’s where they met.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Are they still together?</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: He’s in a mental institution…. He’s been
there for ten years, off and on. Mostly on.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Is he a Nazi?</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: I guess. His parents are. He doesn’t care
about that.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What’s he care about?</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Killing himself.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You think people ever commit suicide out of
happiness?</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: That’s stupid. Why would they?</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: You’re not like the others, are you?… Your
friends.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yes, I am. Basically I am.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Hurt me.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Ow! That’s too hard.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Do it again….</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Get up…you gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: No, you have to leave. I’ve got to write a
paper. Out!</p>
<p><strong>lina moebius</strong>: Bring the paper, too.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I knocked, you didn’t answer.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I just came to get some stuff. I’ll be out in
five minutes. He doesn’t want me around.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: He’s going to die. He won’t take his
medicine. He eats dairy. He probably still smokes when I’m not around. I
asked him to come live with us. Alex offered to share his room,
unsolicited…. But he didn’t want to be any trouble.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Then he couldn’t be bitter about living
alone.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Why deprive him of his greatest pleasure?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Ah, Jesus Christ, Danny, how can you wear
that thing?… You know what it means? To your people…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: They’re not my people….</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Tell it to Hitler.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Oh, he decides? Hitler’s the chief rabbi
now?…</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Is this because of those kids who used to
beat you up?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What kids?…</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: The Polacks? From Sacred Heart?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Nobody ever beat me up. Look, Linda, there’re
fifty reasons. Even if you knew them all, there’d be another fifty you
didn’t know.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Do you know them? I made him some noodles for
dinner. You can heat them up and –</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I’ve got to get back to the –</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: You can heat them up and eat with him.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: It’s Friday….</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Do I give a shit?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: The Torah says not to light a fire on the
Sabbath, because it’s work, correct? But if alternating current’s
running through the wires every second of every day, and I throw a
switch, send it here instead of there, how is that lighting a fire?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: “Do chickens give milk?”</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>tv</strong>: the COMIC is funny in a brutal, compulsive way.
Lots of pop references, implicit postmodern nihilism. The routine
reflects what Danny have against the modern world.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Who’s this?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Dennis Leary.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Leary?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Howard Stern.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Obviously.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Adam Sandler.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Funny?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Not like Mr. Dorfmann.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: He was funny.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: After your mother died, that’s when you
stopped going to shul. Doing your homework. Everything.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: And that’s when the Mets started to
stink.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: ’Cause they got rid of Johnson. He knew how
to deal with the assholes. Dallas Green, please…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Valentine…</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: There’s some maple walnut in the
freezer.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Linda says you’re not supposed to have
dairy.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Just a little… What’s the difference?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Yeah?… Hold on…. It’s for you.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Hello…?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Daniel Balint? My name’s Guy Danielsen. I’m a
reporter with the New York Times.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: New York Times…?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I’m doing a piece on right-wing groups, post
Oklahoma City. I hear you’re an important figure in those circles. You
have a lot of interesting ideas….</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Who told you that?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Isn’t it true?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: No, it’s…yeah, it’s true, but… how’d you get
this number?… No, not here… Maybe Sunday? There’s a place off Queens
Blvd. Near the courthouse…</p>
<p><strong>guy danielsen</strong>: Danny…Guy Danielsen…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You…</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Milk…?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Is it okay if I record this?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: No… Yeah, fine, go ahead… So what’s this
about? Is this about me?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: I’m trying to figure out where the radical
right is going to next….I thought you were the most interesting person
at that meeting.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What about Curtis Zampf?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Curtis is a politician – and a bit of a
hustler. He’s not a thinker.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I agree.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: The other night you said the modern world is a
Jewish disease. Could you elaborate on that?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: In the movement – the racialist movement – we
believe there’s a hierarchy of the races. Not just in IQ, but in the
civilization, the art, the forms of government, the civilizations that
each race produces… Why are you writing this down if you’re recording
it?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: It helps me concentrate…. So does that mean
you’re a white supremacist?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What should I be, a white inferior- ist? A
multicultural Zulu egalitarian? Let me ask, where are your people
from?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: My mother’s family is French, my father’s was
German, originally.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: German. Mine, too. So who do you think’s
given more to the world, the Germans – Beethoven, Goethe, Nietzsche – or
the entire continent of Africa? Ibos, Bantus, Mandingos…</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Danny, what about the Jews?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: The Jews are different…. Blacks are
disgusting and inferior, but it’s like criticizing a retarded child. The
Jews are…a poison in the human well….</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: A poison…?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Let me give you an example…. Sexuality.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Sexuality??? What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You ever fuck a Jewish girl?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: What??!?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Did you ever fuck one, Guy?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: What’s that go to do with…I’ve gone out with a,
with Jewish women. Why?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: And? WHat did you notice?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Notice? Like what…?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Jewish girls like to give head, right?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: I don’t know. Is that right?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: And Jewish men like to get it.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Everybody likes to, don’t they?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yes. It’s very pleasurable. But the Jews are
obsessed with it. You know why?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Because the Jew is essentially female.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Female…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Real men – white, Christian men – we fuck a
woman. We make her come with our cocks. But the Jew doesn’t like to
penetrate and thrust – he can’t assert himself that directly – so he
resorts to perversions. Oral sex is technically a perversion, you know
that, don’t you? After a woman has been with a Jewish man, she never
wants a normal partner again. A normal man.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Does that mean the Jew is the better lover?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You’re not listening. He isn’t better. He
gives pleasure, but that’s actually a weakness.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Danny, what makes you think you know all
this?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Let’s just say I’ve done due diligence.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: So, fine, it’s not that the Jew, the Jews own
the media and the banks. It’s that they’re sexually corrupt.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: The Jews clearly control the media and the
banks. Investment banks, not the commercial ones. But the point is they
carry out in those realms the same principles they display in sexuality.
They undermine traditional life; they deracinate society.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Deracinate… Tear out the roots. A people – a
real people – derives its genius from the land: the sun, the sea, the
soil. This is how they know themselves. But the Jew doesn’t have
soil.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: He has Israel.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Those aren’t Jews.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Of course they’re Jews.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Notice the Israelis: a fundamentally secular
society. They no longer need Judaism because they have soil. The real
Jew is a wanderer, a nomad. He has no roots, no attachments. So he
“universalizes” everything. He can’t hammer a nail, plow a field. He can
only buy and sell, invest capital, manipulate markets. He takes the life
of a people rooted in soil and turns it into a cosmopolitan culture
based on books, ideas, numbers. This is his strength…. Take the great
Jewish minds: Marx, Freud, Einstein. What have they given us: communism,
infantile sexuality and the atom bomb. In a mere three centuries since
these guys emerged from the ghettos of Europe, they’ve taken us from a
world built on order and reason and hurled us into a chaos of class
warfare, irrational urges and relativity, a world where the very
existence of matter and meaning is in doubt. Why? Because it is the
deepest impulse of the Jewish soul to unravel the very fabric of life
until nothing is left but thread, nothing but nothingness. Nothingness
without end…</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Are all Jews the same?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Differences exist, of course, but they’re
irrelevant. For the Jew, his Jewishness dominates everything. Even the
ones who renounce it, who hate it, who want to cut it out of their
hearts a knife…can’t escape. They’re still just Jews.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Danny, this is great. You’re incredibly
articulate. One more thing… How can you believe this when you’re a Jew
yourself?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What? Excuse me?… You’re kidding, right?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Do you know Rabbi Stanley Nadelman? He used to
be at Congregation Beth Elohim in Ozone Park…?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Who? How would I know him?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: He says you were bar mitzvahed there, in March
1988.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You believe that? And you call yourself a
reporter?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: So you’re saying it’s not true.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Look at me. DO I look Jewish? Look…</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Were you ever bar mitzvahed anywhere else?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Do you know who you’re fucking with here?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: That’s what I’m trying to find out, Danny. Who
am I fucking with here?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Listen to me….</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Why would Nadelman lie?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: To discredit me. Because I know who they are.
Look, I thought I explained it to you. Those people can say or do
anything. And they will. It’s all narrative to them, it’s… Are you going
to print what this guy said?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Give me a reason not to.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: It’s slander. It’s reckless disregard. I’ll
sue you and your fucking Jew paper.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Does that mean you deny what he says is true?
Yes or no.</p>
<p><strong>gun</strong>: pulled from Danny’s pants, slammed down on the
table… Guy sits back abruptly. Danny picks it up, cocks it….</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Look at me. Look at me, Guy…. Oh, now you
can’t look at me? Look at me, you schmuck. Look at me…. You print that
shit in the New York Times…I’ll kill myself.</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: Do we have to listen to this shit?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: Why’d we have to leave so fast?</p>
<p><strong>o.l.</strong>: Nobody made you go.</p>
<p><strong>carleton</strong>: Danny’s running from the law.</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: O.L., how come your mother gives you a car
when you’re too fucking blind to drive?</p>
<p><strong>o.l.</strong>: She says ’cause now I can’t crack it up.</p>
<p><strong>carleton</strong>: Hey, O.L., assholes at four o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>carleton</strong>: I thought there were people here….</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I’ll go look….</p>
<p><strong>o.l.</strong>: I better stay with the van….</p>
<p><strong>carleton</strong>: Yeah, you better stay here and guard
it.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: We’re from New York. Curtis Zampf invited
us.</p>
<p><strong>whit</strong>: Who?… Curtis who?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Enough?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Which was his room?</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Number ten.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yeah, I’m trying to reach Carla, is she?… Did
she get my other message?… No, I’ll call back….</p>
<p><strong>various voices</strong>: Fucking niggers… Fucking niggers?
Fucking gooks!…</p>
<p><strong>whit</strong>: …Look, if Hitler had knocked out the RAF in
’39, which he could easily, easily have done, he’d have taken England,
and the U.S. wouldn’t have had –</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: …A staging ground for the invasion, yeah. But
he blew it going after civilian targets. Just like he blew the Russian
front, diverting supplies to Auschwitz….</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Where’s Mrs. Moebius?</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Her place is down the road. But she just comes
out for weekends sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What is this, Stalingrad?</p>
<p><strong>whit</strong>: Gettysburg. But we’re refighting it with World
War I technology. It’s a fucking bloodbath.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: That was unbelievable what you did to Lucas.
The guy’s an animal.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You could do it.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Get out of here….</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You look right through him. He’s there, but
there’s something on the other side of him that you want. It’s all you
want. And whatever’s in the way doesn’t matter…. Then it’s easy.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Either of you know anything about
explosives?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Take a breath, let out a little, relax, then
squeeze. Again…</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Which one were you aiming at?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: The mother.</p>
<p><strong>targets</strong>: the bullets chew up and knock over all four
Jews. And selectively: shooting the man’s face, the woman’s breasts, the
boy and girl in the groin. The dog he merely flattens.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Carla?… It’s me, Danny…Danny Balint…? We met
at that…</p>
<p><strong>carla’s voice</strong>: Yeah, I remember…. Kill any Jews
yet?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I didn’t realize you cared.</p>
<p><strong>carla’s voice</strong>: I don’t. I was just curious how full
of shit you were.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Did you know that there was a New York Times
reporter there that night?</p>
<p><strong>carla’s voice</strong>: Really, which one? I bet it was the
guy with the Prada shoes.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I didn’t notice his shoes…. Did your mother
know he was there?</p>
<p><strong>carla’s voice</strong>: I doubt it. How did you find out?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: He called me up. He wanted to talk to me
about my ideas.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: I bet. He didn’t realize that nobody who
talks such a good game ever plays one.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You weren’t complaining about my play last
time.</p>
<p><strong>carla’s voice</strong>: That’s a much easier game.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Why don’t you come visit, we’ll have a
rematch.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Too many good players down here. I’m with one
right now.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Oh, really?</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Bigger and better.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Then how come you’re talking to me?</p>
<p><strong>carla’s voice</strong>: I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>carleton</strong>: Gas Chamber…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: When are we going to do something?</p>
<p><strong>first waiter</strong>: You know what you want?</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: We sure do.</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: Ham and cheese on white.</p>
<p><strong>first waiter</strong>: We don’t have ham. We don’t have
cheese.</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: What the hell do you have?</p>
<p><strong>first waiter</strong>: That’s what the menus are for.</p>
<p><strong>o.l.</strong>: Roast beef and Swiss.</p>
<p><strong>first waiter</strong>: I said: no cheese.</p>
<p><strong>o.l.</strong>: What’s wrong with cheese?</p>
<p><strong>first waiter</strong>: This is a kosher restaurant. We don’t
serve meat with dairy.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What about chicken?</p>
<p><strong>first waiter</strong>: That’s meat.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: The Bible only says don’t seethe a kid in its
mother’s milk. But chickens don’t give milk.</p>
<p><strong>first waiter</strong>: Look, you want cheese, go someplace
else.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: But it’s stupid, right? You admit it’s
stupid.</p>
<p><strong>first waiter</strong>: No, I don’t admit it’s stupid.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You can have chicken with eggs but not with
milk. Why is that?</p>
<p><strong>first waiter</strong>: I’m not here to talk about religious
law, if you don’t like –</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: But you already talked about it: you said
it’s not stupid. Why isn’t it stupid?</p>
<p><strong>first waiter</strong>: Steve…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Steve’s going to explain it.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: We have a problem here?</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: We sure fucking do. We don’t understand
why you can’t eat chicken with milk. It doesn’t make sense.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Religion isn’t about making sense. It’s about
–</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: It’s about the incomprehensible, Steve, not
the idiotic.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: That explains it! Now we understand!</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: …As the altercation appears to have been
instigated equally on both sides, prison terms strike the court as
excessive.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: However, the defendants’ political views
suggest that they might profit from contact with members of our
community whose experiences differ from their own….</p>
<p><strong>rumanian woman</strong>: …When I refused to have sex with
him, the warden had my sister, Esther, executed in front of the entire
block….</p>
<p><strong>rumanian woman</strong>: …Everyone considered it my fault.
After that, of course, I did anything he wanted.</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: Why didn’t he just rape you?</p>
<p><strong>o.l.</strong>: Who’d want to fuck her anyway?</p>
<p><strong>hate counselor</strong>: I hear one more remark like that, we
go back to the court for resentencing.</p>
<p><strong>rumanian woman</strong>: He was a pig, like you, so perhaps
he had no taste.</p>
<p><strong>hate counselor</strong>: Sit down, please. Thank you,
Mrs. Cohen. Mr Liebowitz, you indicated you had a story you wanted to
tell….</p>
<p><strong>polish man</strong>: …The man was afraid to let us hide on
his farm any longer, but he agreed to take us to a more remote place. On
the way he was stopped at a checkpoint, and when the soldiers found us
in the hay, one of them grabbed my son out of my arms. He began to cry,
so I reached for him, not to take him back, simply…</p>
<p><strong>the man</strong>: mid-70s, tall, stooped, a crushed
spirit.</p>
<p><strong>polish man</strong>: …simply to assure him I was there. But
the sergeant became enraged…. He stuck his bayonet in my son’s chest,
and lifted him up, impaled on it. My son was three years old….</p>
<p><strong>polish man</strong>: …He held him up so that the blood
spurting out of him feel on my face…. The soldiers were laughing.</p>
<p><strong>polish man</strong>: When the blood stopped, the sergeant
pushed my son off the bayonet and said, “There, you can have him
now….”</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: And what did you do?</p>
<p><strong>hate counselor</strong>: What are you trying to say?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What did you do while the sergeant was
killing your son?</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: Forget it, Danny, it’s all bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>hate counselor</strong>: Wait a second…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Shut up. What did you do?</p>
<p><strong>rumanian woman</strong>: What could he have done?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What could he have done?? You fucking
kikes…</p>
<p><strong>hate counselor</strong>: You can’t say that….</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: The Nazi’s killing his kid. He could’ve
jumped the guy. He could’ve gouged his eyes out, grabbed the bayonet and
gutted him…. What would you have done if they were killing your son?</p>
<p><strong>rumanian woman &amp; others</strong>: …They’d have shot him
on the spot…. He would have been dead in two seconds…. Who are you
judge?</p>
<p><strong>hate counselor</strong>: Please sit down.</p>
<p><strong>hate counselor</strong>: Okay, that’s it. You’re going back
to –</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What do you think you should have done?</p>
<p><strong>polish man</strong>: And you, you think you know what you
would have done? You have no idea. You can’t even imagine what that was
like. And you never will….</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: Don’t listen to them, Danny. It’s all a
bunch of crap.</p>
<p><strong>ancient jew</strong>: What is crap?</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: The so-called Holocaust. It never
happened. It’s the hoax of the twentieth century.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Oh, please…</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: Danny, it’s true. There were no six
million. At most, two hundred thousand Jews died in the camps. And the
majority of them were from disease and –</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Where did you read this? Robert
Faurisson?</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: Yeah. He’s a respected scholar. Even No-am
Chomsky says he –</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Billings, if Hitler didn’t kill six million,
why is he your hero?… Concentration camps all over Europe, and he only
gets rid of a measly two hundred thousand…. He’s a putz.</p>
<p><strong>ancient jew</strong>: Hitler was not a putz. Hitler was real.
God created him to punish the Jews for abandoning God.</p>
<p><strong>ancient jew</strong>: It is you who are putzes. Little pishas
with your dreams of hatred and killing…</p>
<p><strong>hate counselor</strong>: Where do you think you’re going?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: …We have nothing to learn from these people.
They should learn from us.</p>
<p><strong>ancient</strong>: And what should we learn from you,
Daniel?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Kill your enemy.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Green dot – shotgun powder. For pipe bombs. A
guy in a lumberyard gave it to me. A donation to the cause.</p>
<p><strong>carleton</strong>: Hey, Danny…. Guess who’s here…. Your
girlfriend… She’s up at the house.</p>
<p><strong>lina</strong>: My L’s keep coming out as C’s….</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: The prisoner returns….</p>
<p><strong>lina</strong>: Danny, get a drink and come talk to me.</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: …Insulting people who were in the camps.
…What’s the point?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: They’re liars and cowards.</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: I’m sure they are. But what do we accomplish
by pointing it out?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: It’s the truth….</p>
<p><strong>lina moebius</strong>: Danny, what do you think of our
troops?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: They have guts. And they know what they
hate…which is good. But they have no idea why; they don’t think, they
don’t read…. They’re on beer and crank half the time….</p>
<p><strong>lina</strong>: The young people in this country… They’re like
pigs; all they want is happiness…. But one needs pigs sometimes.
Liebchen…</p>
<p><strong>lina</strong>: Do you feel you’re making progress here?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You mean Ilio Manzetti?</p>
<p><strong>lina</strong>: Forget Manzetti…. Take on something simple.
Something you can actually accomplish. Maybe he’d be more valuable in
the city.</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: An urban type.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Danny…telephone.</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: He’s mad, Lina, you know that.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: You know what today is?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Linda… How did you get this number?</p>
<p><strong>linda’s voice</strong>: It’s Mom’s yartzeit.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: How did you get the fucking number?</p>
<p><strong>linda’s voice</strong>: I want you to say kaddish for her.
It’s the only thing she asked from us….</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I don’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>linda’s voice</strong>: You do it on the inside….</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Don’t tell me what I –</p>
<p><strong>linda’s voice</strong>: …I want you to do it on the outside,
too.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>linda’s voice</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Who’s Linda?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Why won’t you talk to me?</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: I’m talking to you right now. Who’s
Linda?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: When can I see you?</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: You can’t.</p>
<p><strong>lina</strong>: Carla, it’s time to leave.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: I have to go visit my father.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Your father??</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: He’s at a home out here.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I’m coming to your room tonight.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>lina</strong>: Carla!</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Just after midnight. Five past… But don’t
come through the house, they’ll hear you. I’m in the back bedroom,
second floor. Climb onto the kitchen roof, I’ll leave the window
open.</p>
<p><strong>large woman</strong>: Shabbat shalom.</p>
<p><strong>congregation</strong>: Ba-yom, ha-hoo, ba-yom, ha hoo…</p>
<p><strong>rabbi’s amplified voice</strong>: On that day, the Eternal
shall be One. And His Name shall be One….</p>
<p><strong>rabbi’s amplified voice</strong>: The mourner’s kaddish can
be found on page 187….</p>
<p><strong>large woman</strong>: Is anything wrong?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Shut the fuck up.</p>
<p><strong>rabbi’s amplified voice</strong>: …Grant us peace, thy most
precious gift, O Thou Eternal source of peace. We recall with loving
memory those whom Thou hast summoned unto thee. And we mention by
name…Sophie Budnitz…Bernard Schwabb…Milton Lifter…Aaron Lustig…Minnie
Baum…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: …Harriet Kantor Balint…</p>

<p><strong>rabbi’s voice</strong>: May the Lord bless you and keep
you….</p>
<p><strong>rabbi</strong>: May He cause the light of His countenance to
shine upon you and be gracious unto you….</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Eat shit….</p>
<p><strong>rabbi</strong>: …May you be blessed in your going forth as
you were in your coming….</p>
<p><strong>rabbi</strong>: And let us say…</p>
<p><strong>rabbi &amp; congregation</strong>: Ah – ah – ah….men….</p>
<p><strong>a wristwatch</strong>: 12:05. We are:</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: What are you reading?</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: Leo Strauss… I’ve got to go to Boston. I
came to say goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What about Mrs. Moebius and…?</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: They left an hour ago. You mind some
personal advice? Forget Carla. That’s not the side your bread’s buttered
on. How soon can you get back to the city?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: A week or so. There’s something I want to do
here first.</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: What’s that? Okay. Surprise us…</p>
<p><strong>chaos of voices</strong>: Ow, shit… You’re stepping on my
fucking – …Get off me…Goddammit… Stop it!… Where’s the light?</p>
<p><strong>carleton</strong>: Jew World…!!</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Shut up. Fuck you….</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: What…?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Nothing. Where is it? Okay, let’s take one of
these panels off so we can get under the bema…the stage.</p>
<p><strong>steroid</strong>: Wow, look at this shit….</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What are they doing?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What are you doing? Put that down! …Put it
back in there.</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: What do you care?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I don’t, but…</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: Let’s look at the fucking thing.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Put it there, on the…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Just be careful with the…</p>
<p><strong>o.l.</strong>: “If I were king of the forest…not Prince, not
Duke, not Earl…”</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Open it up.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Here…</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: Oooo… Weird… You read it from right to
left…. The letters look like squashed bugs…. What kind of paper is
that?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: It’s not paper, it’s parchment. It’s made
from sheepskin. And all the letters are drawn by hand.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Neat calligraphy.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: It’s called the flame alphabet. It’s supposed
to be the word of God written in fire.</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: Fire…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: The mystics tried to read the white spaces
around the letters. They thought there was a whole alternative language
hidden there, with secret, alternative meanings.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Cool.</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: How come you know all this shit?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: How come you don’t know it? How can you say
you hate the Jews when you don’t know anything about –</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: Fuck you. I hate the Jews at least as much
as you do.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: No, you don’t…. If you hated them, you’d
study them, so you’d know why you hate them. You know what tefillin is?
Tsitsis? Shotness? You know the kaddish from the kiddush? Eichmann? He
went to Israel. He studied the Torah, the Talmud, the Mishnah, the whole
bit. He hated Jews.</p>
<p><strong>carleton</strong>: Who’s Eichmann?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Who’s Eichmann?!!?</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: He was head of the Gestapo’s Jewish sector. He
deported people to the camps.</p>
<p><strong>carleton</strong>: Can we touch it?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yeah, but not on the letters.</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: Why the fuck not?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Just don’t.</p>
<p><strong>carleton</strong>: Didn’t you see Raiders of the Lost
Ark?</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: What??</p>
<p><strong>carleton</strong>: That was an ark, man. That was a Torah.
They fucked around with it, and the Torah melted their faces.</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: That’s a movie, you moron.</p>
<p><strong>carleton</strong>: Fine, go ahead. Touch the letters.</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: Let me see.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I said not on the –</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Stop it! What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Let’s get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Shema yisrael adonai elohenu adonai
echod.</p>
<p><strong>carleton</strong>: What’d you say?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Nothing. Let’s go….</p>
<p><strong>carleton</strong>: Why are you taking that?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I’m stealing it.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster voice</strong>: …Tragedy was barely averted today
at Temple Ahavat Torah when a bomb planted under the bema failed to
detonate….</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>newscaster voice</strong>: …Authorities say that if it had,
injuries and loss of life could have been in the dozens….</p>
<p><strong>newscaster voice</strong>: Channel 8’s Cindy Pomerantz spoke
to Rabbi Malcolm Weiss.</p>
<p><strong>on tv</strong>: Cindy and the rabbi .</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Rabbi, how is it that disaster and tragedy
were averted here today at Ahavat Torah?</p>
<p><strong>rabbi</strong>: Apparently the power cell in the timer gave
out precisely thirteen minutes before the device was set to go off. So
we can only conclude that once again God has intervened to save the
Jewish people….</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Oh, fuck you…</p>
<p><strong>rabbi</strong>: As you know, Cindy, thirteen is a mystical
number in the Jewish faith. We believe that God has thirteen
attributes…</p>
<p><strong>rabbi</strong>: …Of which the highest is ein sof, which means
“without end,” or, sometimes, “nothingness without end….”</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Nothingness without end…. That’s very
interesting.</p>
<p><strong>rabbi</strong>: The purest form of spirit…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Okay, everybody out. Get out.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Alenu l’shab’ach la’adon hacol…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>steroid</strong>: Phone, Danny.</p>
<p><strong>guy’s voice</strong>: Danny Balint…Guy Danielsen, New York
Times.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What do you want? What happened to your
article?</p>
<p><strong>guy’s voice</strong>: I couldn’t get my editor to run it, but
I bet he will now that you’ve put a bomb in a synagogue. That was you,
wasn’t it, Danny?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Hey, Danny, want to kill a Jew?</p>
<p><strong>drake</strong>: Park up there, we’ll walk back.</p>
<p><strong>drake</strong>: Lie on your stomach and come up on your
elbows.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Why me?</p>
<p><strong>drake</strong>: You want to kill a Jew. I already did.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Who’d you kill?</p>
<p><strong>drake</strong>: Four. But no one this important.</p>
<p><strong>drake</strong>: Okay, it’s over. He’ll take a couple
questions, then come out…. Sight down the rifle toward the door.</p>
<p><strong>through rifle scope</strong>: Danny pans from the side door –
where TWO MEN are smoking – to a waiting limousine.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: How did you know they were Jews?</p>
<p><strong>drake</strong>: I can tell….</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>drake</strong>: I was a Jew in a previous life.</p>
<p><strong>drake</strong>: Here they come.</p>
<p><strong>scope pov</strong>: stirring at the door. The men put out
their cigarettes. Three figures emerge: a MAN and a WOMAN on either side
of an older, distinguished-looking man . They walk this way.</p>
<p><strong>drake</strong>: Shoot him in the head. Always shoot a Jew in
the head.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I’m a bad shot. I don’t think I can –</p>
<p><strong>drake</strong>: Just get him in the cross-hairs. With those
shells, anywhere you hit him, it’ll bounce around, rip his insides all
up.</p>
<p><strong>scope pov</strong>: the TRIO walking this way, cross-hairs on
Manzetti.</p>
<p><strong>drake</strong>: Right there! Just squeeze he trigger. Slow…
Do it!</p>
<p><strong>drake</strong>: You missed on purpose.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I didn’t. I told you, I can’t –</p>
<p><strong>drake</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>drake</strong>: I knew it.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Oh, Jesus…Drake, are you okay…?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Kyle, it’s me Danny. How you doing?… I had to
come into the city to see Mrs. MOEBIUS… No, I gave Drake the van, didn’t
he bring it back?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: …Since when?… Really? And he didn’t call?…
No, I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Sure, come on down…. Can you bring my stuff?…
Thanks…and if Drake shows up, let me know right away…. Good…</p>
<p><strong>lina</strong>: How have things been going?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>lina</strong>: We want to talk to you about something…. We’re
about to launch an aboveground, intellectually serious fascist
movement.</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: We want to build bridges to certain
positions in the political mainstream: works like The Bell Curve,
Sociobiology, anti-Zionism, anti- immigration, the com-munitarian
issue…. We’ll hold conferences: invite liberals, blacks, Jews. Chomsky,
Cockburn, Stanley Crouch, Shahack….</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I’ve been waiting all my life for something
like this.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. moebius</strong>: We want you to help run it. Give
speeches, lead seminars… Handle the fund-raising.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Fund-raising??</p>
<p><strong>mrs. moebius</strong>: We think you’d be good at it.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What about…Manzetti, the synagogues….</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: That doesn’t seem to be happening, does
it?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I’ve been stuck out in the country with those
guys who just want to paint swastikas and heil Hitler. How am I supposed
to –</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: Danny, the night we met, you said the name
Ilio Manzetti. We were impressed. We were excited. But here it is
September, and Mr. Manzetti is still walking around breathing the
air.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. moebius</strong>: We need intellectuals, we have enough
thugs already.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I’m not an intellectual…. I mean, I read,
but… Fund-raising isn’t what I…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. moebius</strong>: Look, if you want to kill Jews on your
free time, fine. We need you to raise money. Will you do that for
us?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. moebius</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. moebius</strong>: Do you have a suit? Let’s get him
one…. And a cell phone too. And if you insist on blowing up a synagogue,
make it that big one on Fifth Avenue, would you?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Beth Shalom? It’s Reform.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. moebius</strong>: So what?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: They’re not that Jewish.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. moebius</strong>: I don’t care what they are. I know
those people, and I don’t like them. The rest are just a bunch of kikes,
aren’t they?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Here…</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Where’d you get this?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I stole it. From a synagogue.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: How come there’s no punctuation?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: That was a later invention, it’s not in the
scrolls…. Anyway, the Jews know where the sentences end. They know the
whole thing by heart. Every word. Every letter.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Do you know it like that? By heart.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: But you can read it, the Hebrew…. Right?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What do you care?</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: ’Cause I want to know…. What is this word?
This one here…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Va-yomer… And he said. It goes the other
way.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Oh, yeah…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Va-yomer adonai el Avram: lech lecha
mayartzcha oo-mimohlad-tcha oo-m’bayt avaycha el ha-ertez asher
arecha…</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: What’s it mean?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: And God said to Avram, take yourself away
from your land and from the place you were born and from your father’s
house into the land – a different land – and I will show you….</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: I want to learn to read it.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Know your enemy…. ’Cause it’s a basic text of
Western culture. I want to read it in the original. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Hebrew’s very difficult. It would take
years.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: I’m good at languages.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Put something on. You’re not supposed to be
naked in front of it.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: They think it’s the word of God, and it’s
holy, and the flesh isn’t….</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: That’s stupid.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yeah, it’s stupid. Put it on, or I won’t
teach you.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: See, the Jews love to separate things: the
holy from the profane, milk from meat, wool from linen, the Sabbath from
the week, the Jew from the gentile…. As if one little scrap of this was
going to completely contaminate that.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: What assholes.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You can’t curse in front of it either.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Who gets contaminated, the Jews or the
gentiles?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Good question. Both. Aleph…</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: It looks a little like a swastika.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: It’s silent. It holds a place, takes a vowel.
The vowels are little dots that go under the letters.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Where are they?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: They don’t put them in the Torah. I’ll get
you a chumash, they’ll have them there…Bet…Gimel…Dalid…Hay… How come
you’re here instead of with Curtis? Besides the Hebrew lessons…</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: The sex is better.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Even though his dick is so big?</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: With you there’s a tragic dimension.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Vuv…Zayin…Chet…Tet…</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: This will be a different kind of device.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: That damn thing. You know how it made me
look…?</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: I’m sorry, Danny. It won’t happen again. I’m
going to use a brand-new power cell. Plus we’ll have a back-up
timer.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I’ve gotta kill some Jews, Kyle. I’m serious.
I’m always talking about it. This time it’s gotta happen.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: It will.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What about Drake, did he ever show up?</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: No, it’s weird, man. Nobody knows where he
went.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: …Hush, come on, don’t cry. Everything will
be all right….</p>
<p><strong>danny/nazi sergeant</strong>: What’s the matter here?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Excuse me, I’m sorry, just a moment…</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Please, sweetheart, you have to go. I’ll see
you soon.</p>
<p><strong>danny/nazi sergeant</strong>: Fucking kike.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Hey, Danny…Danny…</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: It’s Stuart. Stuart Schoenbaum.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Shlomo?</p>
<p><strong>stuart</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>stuart</strong>: Jeez, it’s been since, what, Kenny’s
wedding.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yeah, uh… So how are you? What’s going
on?</p>
<p><strong>stuart</strong>: I’m in the rabbinic program at JTS…</p>
<p><strong>stuart</strong>: What about you? What are you doing?
Something strange, I bet.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I’m in a kind of…underground…thing.</p>
<p><strong>stuart</strong>: Are you an artist?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: No, no… Not that kind of… underground. More a
private… business. Private.</p>
<p><strong>stuart</strong>: You remember Miriam….</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yeah, hey, how’re you doing…</p>
<p><strong>miriam</strong>: Hey…</p>
<p><strong>stuart</strong>: She’s at Yale Law – interning with the
district attorney… We’re getting married next spring. In Israel.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Wow, that’s uh…great…</p>
<p><strong>stuart</strong>: It’s great seeing you….</p>
<p><strong>miriam</strong>: Maybe Danny’d like to come to the minyan for
the holidays….</p>
<p><strong>stuart</strong>: Oh, good idea. We’re davening with this
group from the seminary. Interesting people, very open-minded, you might
like them. And guess who comes…Avi! You guys could go at it again like
the good old days.</p>
<p><strong>stuart</strong>: Danny and Avi used to argue about
everything. Torah, Talmud, politics, girls. It always ended in a
fistfight.</p>
<p><strong>miriam</strong>: I remember.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I always won.</p>
<p><strong>miriam</strong>: The arguments, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>stuart</strong>: It’s a K.I. on 101st. In the little chapel.
Try to make it. It’d be fun.</p>
<p><strong>brand</strong>: You write that? Come work for me. You’ve got
a lot to learn; I can teach it to you.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I have a job.</p>
<p><strong>brand</strong>: This? This is a joke. I’ll give your group a
thousand bucks.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You gave fifty thousand to that college
magazine.</p>
<p><strong>brand</strong>: Fifty’s an exaggeration. Anyway, that was a
different moment. Things were possible that aren’t now.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Actually, I think this moment has
possibilities that –</p>
<p><strong>brand</strong>: Yeah, I read your piece. It’s very smart. And
very wrong.</p>
<p><strong>brand</strong>: Forget the Jewish stuff. It doesn’t play
anymore. There’s only the market, now, and it doesn’t care who you
are.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: People still need values, beliefs….</p>
<p><strong>brand</strong>: No, they don’t. Not the smart ones. Look,
I’ll give you five grand if you can document your tax-exempt status….
But when you fall off this horse, come see me. I can show you how to
make a lot of money.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I don’t care about money.</p>
<p><strong>brand</strong>: You will.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You’re a Jew. Maybe you don’t realize it, but
you are.</p>
<p><strong>brand</strong>: Maybe I am. Maybe we’re all Jews now. What’s
the difference?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: How many of you think of yourselves as
anti-Semites? Good. Actually, the term is a bit imprecise since
technically Jews are only one of the Semitic peoples…. In fact, Arabs
are Semites, as are the Eritreans, the Ethiopians, and so on…. But for
our purposes an anti- Semite is someone who hates or is against Jews….
Now, why do we hate them?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Let me put it another way. Do we hate them
because they push their way in where they don’t belong? Or because
they’re clannish and keep to themselves?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: …Because they’re tight with money, or because
they flash it around? Because they’re Bolsheviks or because they’re
capitalists? Because they have the highest IQs, or because they have the
most active sex lives?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Do you want to know the real reason we hate
them?…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: …Because we hate them. Because they exist.
Because it is an axiom of civilization that just as man longs for woman,
loves his children and fears death, he hates the Jews. There is no
reason. If there were, some smart-ass kike would give us an argument,
try to prove we were wrong. And of course that would only make us hate
them more. In fact we have all the reasons we need in three simple
letters: J-E-W. Jew. Say it a million times. It is the only word that
never loses its meaning: Jew Jew Jew Jew Jew Jew Jew Jew Jew Jew Jew Jew
Jew….</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: “My country ’tis of thee, Sweet land of
liberty, Of thee I…”</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: B’Rosh Hashanah yika-teyvun, uv’yom tsom
kippur yey-chateymun…</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: And it came to pass after these things that
God tested Abraham…</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: …And said to him, “Abraham.” And he said,
“Here am I…” And God said, “Take your son, your only son, whom you
love…”</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: It’s not his only son….</p>
<p><strong>another voice</strong>: The only one he loves.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: They only kill them when they love them?</p>
<p><strong>avi</strong>: What are you doing here, I thought you were a
Nazi.</p>
<p><strong>stuart</strong>: Come on, Avi…</p>
<p><strong>avi</strong>: You know what this guy told me once: Islam and
Judaism both start with Abraham murdering his son: first sending Ishmael
into the desert, then sacrificing Isaac….</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: Shhhh… Can you please be quiet?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: And Christianity’s the same, with minor
variations.</p>
<p><strong>avi</strong>: Ridiculous. Folks, don’t listen to this guy.
He’s a well-known anti-Semite.</p>
<p><strong>miriam</strong>: Avi, please…</p>
<p><strong>avi</strong>: …Look, he’s a skinhead.</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: It’s just a style, Avi…. There are
antiracist skins.</p>
<p><strong>avi</strong>: Believe me, Danny’s the racist kind. Are you a
fascist, Danny? Yes or no.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What’s a fascist?</p>
<p><strong>avi</strong>: I rest my case. He’s a Jewish Nazi. He always
was.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Whereas Avi’s a Zionist Nazi.</p>
<p><strong>avi</strong>: The Zionists aren’t Nazis.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: They’re racist, they’re militaristic, they
act like bullyboys in the territories….</p>
<p><strong>avi</strong>: They don’t have extermination camps.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: They had Sabra and Shattila.</p>
<p><strong>miriam</strong>: Do you hate them because they’re wimps or
because they’re bullyboys?</p>
<p><strong>avi</strong>: That was the Lebanese, that wasn’t –</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: The Israeli Army knew about the camps.
Sharon encouraged the falangists to go in there and murder all the –</p>
<p><strong>avi</strong>: You don’t know that. There’s no –</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Read the early Zionists on European Jewry;
they sound like Goebbels.</p>
<p><strong>avi</strong>: They sound like you.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: The Nazis did everything the f�hrer told
them. You do everything the Torah tells you. Or the rebbe. Identical
slave mentality.</p>
<p><strong>miriam</strong>: Why did you come tonight? To see me?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: To hear them read Torah.</p>
<p><strong>miriam</strong>: I thought you hated Torah.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: That doesn’t mean I don’t like hearing
it.</p>
<p><strong>miriam</strong>: Point out all the lies and fucked-up
thinking.</p>
<p><strong>miriam</strong>: You know the joke: a Jew’s shipwrecked on a
desert island. When they rescue him, they see he’s built two synagogues.
They say, for vhat do you need two synagogues? He says, vun to pray in,
and vun I’d never set foot in so long as I live, so help me God. You
pray in the one you’d never set foot in…and vice versa.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I can’t help what I think.</p>
<p><strong>miriam</strong>: This is me.</p>
<p><strong>miriam</strong>: Tell me about Lina Moebius.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: How did you…?</p>
<p><strong>miriam</strong>: I work in the DA’s office. You go to those
meetings, half the people there are informants.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You mean the Times guy?</p>
<p><strong>miriam</strong>: Which Times guy?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: With the shoes… There was more than one?</p>
<p><strong>miriam</strong>: Danny…Danny… Shit…</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Payn tash-chiton v’ashiytem…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: V’asitem…</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: V’asitem lechem pessel to-monat. And make no
graven image of the Lord, or the form of any figure, or of man or woman,
or beast or fowl or fish or anything that looks like anything. Because
He’s not like anything. Not only can’t you see Him or hear Him, you
can’t even think about Him. I mean, what’s the difference between that
and Him not existing?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: No difference.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Christianity’s silly, but at least there’s
something to believe in. Or not believe. Judaism there’s nothing.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Nothing but nothingness…Judaism’s not about
belief.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: What’s it about?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: About doing things. You light candles, say
prayers, keep the Sabbath, visit the sick….</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: And belief follows?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: No. Nothing follows. You don’t do it because
it’s smart or stupid or it saves your soul. You’re not saved. Nobody’s
saved. You do it because the Torah tells you do. You submit to the
Torah.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Fuck that.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Don’t curse in front of it.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Why should I submit?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You shouldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: You think I should just because there’s no
reason?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: No, I think you shouldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Judaism doesn’t even need God. You have the
Torah, the law. That’s your fucking God…. The book’s closed.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You’re learning the Hebrew really fast.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: I told you, I’m good at this.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Plus you have nothing else to do all day.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Oh, am I learning it faster than you did?
Maybe I’m smarter.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Is that funny? You think Jews are the only
smart ones?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What…? You think I’m Jewish?</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: It’s all you talk about. Jewish, Jewish,
Jewish. Nobody talks about it that much except the Jews.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Nazis talk about it all the time.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Do they?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: The real Nazis. Hitler, Goebbels, they talked
about Jews incessantly…. You ever read their diaries?…</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Is that why you became a Nazi? So you could
talk about Jews incessantly?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Believe me, Adolf Hitler couldn’t possibly
have hated the Jews as much as I do. Not in a billion years. You know
why?</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: ’Cause he wasn’t a rabbi.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You want a punch in the mouth?</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Okay… Why don’t we light candles on Friday?
Let’s light candles…. And say the kaddish.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Kaddish is the prayer for the dead.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: I mean kiddush. Let’s say kiddush. And shave
my head, fuck through a sheet, all that stuff… Come on, just for fun. To
see what it’s like…</p>
<p><strong>down in front</strong>: Mrs. Moebius and Danny talk in low
tones.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. moebius</strong>: Half the right-wing money in New York
is here tonight. They came to see you. If you impress them, if you do
what I know you can, this movement will be up and running by tomorrow.
And on the front page of the New York Times in six months.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: We tested the new bomb.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. moebius</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: We redesigned the timing mechanism. It can’t
possibly malfunction.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. moebius</strong>: Danny, please. Just give your speech….
And nothing about Jews, okay?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Shema yisroel adonai elohenu adonai
echod.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Who knows what that is?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: A Jewish prayer.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Can anybody imagine why I would say a Jewish
prayer?</p>
<p><strong>another voice</strong>: Because you’re a Jew.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: That could be one reason. What’s another? Let
me put it this way…who here would like to destroy the Jews? Who wants to
grind their bones into the dust?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: And who wants to see them rise again,
wealthier, more successful, powerful, cultured and intelligent than
ever?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Then you know what you have to do?… You have
to love them.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Did he say love them? Love the Jews? It
sounds strange, I know, but with these people nothing is simple. The Jew
says that all he wants is to be left alone to study his Torah, do a
little business and fornicate with his over-sexed wife…. But it isn’t
true. He wants to be hated. He longs for our scorn. He clings to it as
if it were the very core and mystery of his being. If Hitler had not
existed, the Jews would have invented him. For without such hatred, the
so-called Chosen People would vanish from the earth….</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: …And this reveals a terrible truth, the crux
of our problem as Nazis: the worse the Jews are treated, the stronger
they become. Egyptian slavery made them a nation; the pogroms hardened
them, Auschwitz gave birth to the State of Israel. Suffering, it seems,
is the very crucible of their genius. If the Jews are, as one of their
own has said, a people who will not take yes for an answer, then let us
say yes to them. If they thrive on opposition, let us cease to oppose
them. The way to annihilate them, utterly and completely, is to open our
arms, take them into our homes and embrace them. Only then will they
vanish into assimilation, dilution…and love. But we cannot pretend. The
Jew is nothing if not clever. He will see through condescension and
hypocrisy. To destroy him, we will have to love him sincerely.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: But if the Jews are strengthened by hate,
wouldn’t this “destruction” you speak of – by love or by any other means
– in fact make them more powerful than they are already?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yes. Infinitely more. They would become as
God.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: It is the Jews’ destiny to the annihilated so
that they can be deified…. Jesus understood this perfectly. And look
what was accomplished there with the death of just one enlightened Jew.
Imagine what would happen if we killed them all!! So, let us say
together… Shema yisroel…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. moebius</strong>: Are you out of your mind?!</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I was just trying to make a point. If –</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Oh, my God… Lina…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. moebius</strong>: I’m relieving you of all duties. I
don’t want you working for us anymore….</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You can’t. Do you know how many people I’ve
brought into…the movement…?</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Lina, come here!</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: According to police, he had just left the
restaurant and was walking the block and a half back to his office, when
the gunman stepped out of this doorway, fired seven times at point-
blank range…then fled on foot.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Who was it?</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: …Paramedics arrived within ninety seconds,
but Mr. Manzetti was declared dead at the scene.</p>
<p><strong>anchor’s voice</strong>: Ilio Manzetti was one of the
respected and influential men in New York. As an investment banker,
diplomat, adviser to presidents and mayors, he helped shape public
policy and private finance for more than three decades. He’ll be missed,
Phil. This is Michael Port with New York 1.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Do you think I…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. moebius</strong>: Danny, please, we don’t want to
know.</p>
<p><strong>anchor’s voice</strong>: The assailant is described as a
white male in his late 20s….</p>
<p><strong>kyle’s voice</strong>: You finally killed a Jew, man. How’s
it feel?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Kyle…I can’t talk right now….</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Did you kill Ilio Manzetti?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>photographer</strong>: Not the camera, don’t hurt the
camera…</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Did you kill him?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Two days ago you addressed a Nazi rally. Last
week you went to a Torah study group.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What were you, following me?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: How do you reconcile the two?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I don’t. Look, stay out of what you don’t
understand.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Explain it so I can.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You work for the New York Times. Your whole
job in life is not to understand things like me.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: I don’t think you know what you are.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yeah, and what are you? A Times man? A
Presbyterian? Impotent? A prick?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Who killed Manzetti?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: If I tell you, will you pull the story? Not
write about me?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: It’s too late…. If I didn’t, somebody else
would. Yom Kippur starts at sundown. Will you go to synagogue?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Get the fuck away from me.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Hey, Danny, just one more!</p>
<p><strong>miriam</strong>: You’re telling me you killed him? You?
Killed him? Bullshit. What kind of gun did you use?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: A forty-five.</p>
<p><strong>miriam</strong>: It was a nine millimeter.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You’re lying.</p>
<p><strong>miriam</strong>: So are you… But they’ll believe you…. Lina
Moebius is saying the whole thing was your idea. That you proposed it in
a meeting at her house. Ah, Jesus, Danny… What were you thinking? Are
you glad Manzetti’s dead? Do you really want to kill Jews? You want to
kill me?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I was just talking. I – look, I can’t help
what I think.</p>
<p><strong>miriam</strong>: All right, what if all along you were
actually infiltrating the Nazis – to expose them….</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: But I wasn’t.</p>
<p><strong>miriam</strong>: And only talked about killing Manzetti to
convince them you were an anti-Semite. If you’d had any idea somebody
would take it seriously, you never would have said it.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I can’t say that.</p>
<p><strong>miriam</strong>: Think about your father. Your sister.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: The truth doesn’t mean anything to you, does
it?</p>
<p><strong>miriam</strong>: Danny, I’m trying to – save you.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Fucking kike.</p>
<p><strong>miriam</strong>: Try to get Lina Moebius on tape, telling you
to do something. Something violent… That’s right, I don’t care about
truth. I care about you. Kol Nidre’s at six-thirty. I’ve got to meet
Stuart. We’ll be at the minyan tonight and tomorrow. If you need me,
come there….</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: It’s erev Yom Kippur…. We’ll have dinner,
then go to shul. Atone for our sins.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Come on, we can be like Eichmann. He studied
Torah. He hated Jews.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Is it like Eichmann? Are we goofing?</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: I don’t know. I just want to try it.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Shit… Did you talk to your mother today?</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: No. What are you looking for?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Nothing. Why are you doing this? I thought
God didn’t exist.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: He commands it whether He exists or not…
Look, we can fight him and be crushed. Or we can submit.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: And be crushed.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Yeah, okay. But what if…what if…
submitting…being crushed, being nothing, not mattering, what if that’s
the best feeling we can have?</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Look, just light the candles with me. Then
we’ll eat. You have to eat.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You eat first, then you light. Once you
light, it’s Yom Kippur, which means you’re fasting, so you
can’t…eat.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: A woman of valor, who can find her? Her price
is above rubies….</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Miriam, it’s me, Danny…. Come on, the holiday
hasn’t started, pick up the – …Is Stuart davening Ne’ilah tomorrow at
the minyan… ’Cause he always does… Tell him I’m doing it instead….</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Miriam, I’m davening…. He gives me any
trouble, I’ll beat the shit out of him right there in the room. I’m
serious….</p>
<p><strong>lina</strong>: Why didn’t you tell us?</p>
<p><strong>drake</strong>: I was hurt. I just…</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: He went to his friends’ place and I laid
up there ’til he was better. Then he called me.</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: You should’ve gone to the police.</p>
<p><strong>lina</strong>: I don’t think Drake wants to talk to the
police. Do you?</p>
<p><strong>drake</strong>: I’ll take care of him myself.</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: Daniel Balint.</p>
<p><strong>lina</strong>: Hello…?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Lina… It’s happening. Tonight.</p>
<p><strong>lina</strong>: What is happening?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Beth Shalom. Like you wanted.</p>
<p><strong>lina</strong>: Beth Shalom? What are you talking about? Who
is this…?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Lina, you said if I was going to plant a
bomb, I should –</p>
<p><strong>nazi soldier</strong>: Kill him!</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: How’re we doing?</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: That’s all we’ve got left.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: It’ll be enough if we use it right. Okay, the
service’ll go about another hour. Say an hour for the janitors, then one
more just to be safe… We’ll go in at midnight.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Didn’t you get anything?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I’m not hungry…. Come on, let’s drive
around…. We don’t want to be spotted here.</p>
<p><strong>lina</strong>: He is trying to set us up.</p>
<p><strong>lina</strong>: I want him dead by tomorrow night. That lies
within your capacities, correct?</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: Yes, I believe that a bomb is going to be
planted tonight at Temple Emanu-el on 65th Street…. By the same man who
killed Ilio Manzetti… His name is Daniel Balint….</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Oh, what is this shit?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Keep driving. Don’t slow down.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Christ…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Not too fast.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: You said they didn’t have night guards.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: They don’t. I checked twenty times…. Somebody
must have talked.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Who even knew?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Mrs. Moebius.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Why? Why would she?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: The Manzetti thing must have scared her. She
thinks she’ll get implicated.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: So what do we do with the device?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Take a right on 59th… We’ll put it someplace
else.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I have an idea….</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Over here.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: It’s all reinforced in here. It’s not going to
blow out the way we want it….</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: If I went back to the lumberyard, the guy’d
give me all the dynamite I wanted. Untraceable, you wouldn’t – need
to…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: No, it has to be tomorrow. You won’t get this
many of them in here for another year. It’ll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: It’s not going to be fine. It’s –</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Just do it.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: It’s just somebody on the street.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: When do you want it to go off?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Seven-thirty tomorrow evening.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: So that’s what? Nineteen thirty minutes…what
time is it now…</p>
<p><strong>front page</strong>: The Manzetti crime scene with screaming
headline: “MANZETTI SLAYER JEWISH NAZI.” Next to this another tab:</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: …You’re saying that when he first appeared
at your house, you had no idea he was Jewish….</p>
<p><strong>mrs. moebius</strong>: None whatsoever. But I have to admit,
I’m not terribly surprised.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. moebius</strong>: I think anti-semitism today is largely
a Jewish phenomenon. Wouldn’t you agree?</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: In the Third Reich, weren’t a number of
high-ranking Nazis of Jewish origin?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. moebius</strong>: Yes, and they were said to be the most
virulent proponents of the Final Solution. Really, who but a Jew would
want to kill Ilio Manzetti simply because he was Jewish? Who thinks
about such things?</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: The papers are going to report tomorrow
that your colleague, Curtis Zampf, has been a federal informant for the
past two years. Do you believe that?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. moebius</strong>: Curtis is always more complicated than
he seems. Even now.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: And so, on this, the most solemn day of
the Jewish year, a former yeshiva student is being sought in connection
with a monstrous hate crime that –</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Gamar tov.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: …They cast lots, and the lot fell on
Jonah…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Miriam called, looking for you. She said you
might come, so I…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You gotta get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: You don’t own this place.</p>
<p><strong>stuart</strong>: Listen, Danny, you can’t just barge in and
–</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Shut up…</p>
<p><strong>miriam</strong>: You shut up. Who do you think you are?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: There’s a bomb here. It’s going to go off at
seven-thirty.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Oh, please…</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: It’s Yom Kippur…. People are davening…. Can
you take it outside…. You have some nerve….</p>
<p><strong>danny/nazi soldier</strong>: Kill them. Kill them all.</p>
<p><strong>stuart</strong>: Danny, listen, people expect me to daven;
they don’t want someone they don’t know – leading their prayers.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Get out of my way.</p>
<p><strong>murmuring voices</strong>: What’s going on?… Who is this?…I
thought Stuart was davening….</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Page 766.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yis-gadal, v’yis-kadash sh’mey raba…</p>
<p><strong>enraged man</strong>: Jesus Christ, you know who that is?…
You see the paper?</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: You’re reading the paper on Yom Kippur,
Barry?</p>
<p><strong>enraged wife</strong>: I saw the paper. That’s not him, that
guy was darker…. This is somebody else.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: That guy wouldn’t go to shul, Barry…</p>
<p><strong>enraged man</strong>: You want to bet? I’ll bet you anything…
Let’s go, we’re leaving….</p>
<p><strong>enraged wife</strong>: Oh, for God’s sake, you leave.</p>
<p><strong>enraged man</strong>: I’m going to get a cop.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Da-amiran b’alma, v’imru amen…</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: I got one….</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Are you kidding me??</p>
<p><strong>billings</strong>: Now do you know where he is?</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Yeah, I bet I do.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Wait a minute…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Stop praying. You’ve got to get out of here….
All of you…</p>
<p><strong>stuart</strong>: You wanted to daven. Now daven….</p>
<p><strong>people</strong>: Who’s that?… What is he…oh, my God…</p>
<p><strong>avi</strong>: Put down the weapon. Put it down….</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Drake! Up here…</p>
<p><strong>enraged man</strong>: See, he knows him. The Nazi
bastard…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Get everybody out of here. Fast.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Drake…</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: Avinu malkenu, choney-nu v’aneyenu… Avinu
malkenu, choney-nu v’aneyenu, ki eyn banu ma-asim… – nu va-aneynu…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Drake, I’m right here….</p>
<p><strong>enraged man</strong>: Let them kill each other. They’re
animals.</p>
<p><strong>enraged wife</strong>: Barry, for God’s sake…</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Danny!</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: Cha’nainu v’anainu, ki ain baw-nu
ma’ah-seem…</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: …Asey imanu tz’dakah va’chesed… Asey imanu
tz’dakah va’chesd, v’ho- shi –</p>
<p><strong>carla’s voice</strong>: Danny, no…</p>
<p><strong>rav zingesser</strong>: Danny, good to see you…I wanted to
take up that discussion we were having… …about Abraham and Isaac.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I can’t right now….</p>
<p><strong>zingesser</strong>: You remember what you said, that Isaac
actually died on Mt. Moriah? I’ve been thinking maybe you’re right… Died
yet was reborn in olam ha-bah….</p>
<p><strong>zingesser</strong>: Danny, stop… …Where are you going?… Don’t
you know, there’s nobody up there?</p>
