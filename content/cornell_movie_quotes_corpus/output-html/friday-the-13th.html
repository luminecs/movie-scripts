<p><strong>camp crystal lake</strong>: Established 1935</p>
<p><strong>claudette</strong>: Have you seen Barry?</p>
<p><strong>counsellor</strong>: He and Chloe were at the Lodge last time
I saw him.</p>
<p><strong>claudette</strong>: We’ve got to talk.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>claudette</strong>: You said we were special.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I meant everything.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: You know what I said, though.</p>
<p><strong>claudette</strong>: I can’t, Barry…</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I care very much.</p>
<p><strong>claudette</strong>: Does Chloe kiss as good as I do?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I wouldn’t know.</p>
<p><strong>claudette</strong>: Oh, you…</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Claudette…</p>
<p><strong>claudette</strong>: Somebody’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: No, they won’t…</p>
<p><strong>claudette</strong>: Somebody’s there, Barry.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Come on, Claudette. A man’s not made of
stone.</p>
<p><strong>claudette</strong>: Let’s go back, Barry…</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I need you so much, Claudette.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: as BARRY is stopped against a
tree.</p>
<p><strong>reaction shot</strong>: BARRY, horrified by the sight.</p>
<p><strong>quick cut to</strong>: CHLOE, out searching for the missing
Counsellors. She stands at the edge of the clearing, her hands pressed
on her temples, her throat filled with a scream of terror. The MUSIC has
stopped abruptly.</p>
<p><strong>dj</strong>: It’s 7:01 on Friday the 13th of June. This is
Big Dave and it’s time for you lazy bones to GET OUT OF BED! It’s black
cat day in Crystal Lake. Don’t forget the big drawing today to see who
gets our FRIDAY THE 13TH Monster Surprise: either a man’s digital
continuous readout watch or a Panasonic color television set!</p>
<p><strong>dj</strong>: Don’t walk under a ladder! Don’t spill any salt,
don’t…</p>
<p><strong>salesman</strong>: I’m sick of them repeats.</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: I musta seen that Kojak 82 times.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Excuse me. How far is Camp Crystal Lake?</p>
<p><strong>salesman operator</strong>: They gonna open that place Camp
Blood? again?</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: COP What is it, Eddie? Forty</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: OIL MAN ’Bout that.</p>
<p><strong>salesman</strong>: Be an interesting summer.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Can I get a bus or something?</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: Not likely. Sam? You goin’ out to the
crossroads?</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: Give her a lift? That’s hallway.</p>
<p><strong>oil man</strong>: No sweat, Trudy. Let’s do it to it,
kid.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Name’s Annie.</p>
<p><strong>oil man</strong>: Okay, Annie. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>trudy</strong>: I wouldn’t send my kids to that camp for all
the tea in China.</p>
<p><strong>salesman</strong>: I thought you hated your kids.</p>
<p><strong>oil man</strong>: All the girls up there gonna look as good
as you?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>oil man</strong>: Goddamnit, Ralph! Get outta here. Don’t
worry about him. He’s harmless. G’won. Git!</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: It’s Friday the 13th.</p>
<p><strong>oil man</strong>: Climb on up, Miss.</p>
<p><strong>oil man</strong>: Must be the fourth time somebody’s tried to
reopen that place.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Camp Crystal Lake?</p>
<p><strong>oil man</strong>: Something always happens up there.</p>
<p><strong>dj</strong>: …of bed. I’m gonna count to three and then you
better get up. It’s 7:24. A beautiful day. Weatherman Dr. Jim says it’s
gonna be a nine point five day. Here’s Meatloaf from the Bat Out of Hell
album.</p>
<p><strong>oil man</strong>: Don’t let the spooks getcha, Annie.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: No sweat. Thanks a lot for the lift.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Hiya! I’m headed for Camp Crystal Lake. Can
you help me out?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I can’t remember being this excited about
anything. I want to be a teacher when I finish at Southern State. I
guess I’ve always wanted to work with children. I hate it when people
call ’em kids. Sounds like little goats.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: The job market for teachers is supposed to be
the pits these days, but I don’t care. When you have a dream as long as
I have, you’ll do anything…</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Wasn’t that Camp Crystal Lake? Just back
there?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I think we better stop… Please stop… Please!
Stop!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Please!</p>
<p><strong>marcie</strong>: Sex is all you ever think of, Neddy.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: There you are dead wrong.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Ha!</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Sometimes I only think about kissing women.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Ow!</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: I was just wondering if you thought there’d by
any other gorgeous women at Camp Crystal Lake. Besides yourself.</p>
<p><strong>marcie</strong>: You are a true pierce of work, Ned.</p>
<p><strong>marcie</strong>: How about our last jay?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Good call.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: What about the dope paragraph in Mr. Christy’s
letter?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Quote: Controlled substances are expressly
forbidden. Possession or use of marijuana or alcohol on campgrounds will
means instant dismissal. Unquote.</p>
<p><strong>marcie</strong>: We got two weeks before the kids even
arrive. Then I’ll act responsibly. Until then, hit me.</p>
<p><strong>marcie</strong>: It’s beautiful…</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Yeah, and it also look like it hasn’t seen a
coat of paint in six years.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Wanta give me a hand here?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Alice?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Wanta roll this sucker out of the way.
Alice?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Cabin B is ready.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Push on this side. Alice, this is Jack,
Marcie and Ned. Push.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: That’s got her. Thanks. I’m Steve Christy.
Welcome to Camp Crystal Lake. You got some grubby clothes? Climb into
’em. Alice, see if Bill has cleaned out the boathouse. I want him to
start with the canoes. What happened to Brenda?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: You told her to sweep the courts.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I’d rather she painted. Let’s go, folks.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: I thought we had two weeks…</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: You can changed in three.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Steve said for you to start on the boats.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I finished the boats.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: I’ll tell him.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Alice? The others show up?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Everybody except the girl who’s supposed to
handle the kitchen. Annie.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You think you’re gonna last all summer?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: I’m not sure I’ll last all week. I’ll tell
Steve.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Shim it up just a scooch.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Perfection. Hold it.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: To answer your question, my parents once
owned this camp. There were some tragic accidents and they went
bankrupt. I promised them I’d reopen if I could. See if it closes right
now.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Looks good.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Perfection. Did you meet Brenda?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: She’s archery. He’s rifle ranged. And I’m
behind schedule. Let’s go, Ned.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Come on back here and let’s above the float
in.</p>
<p><strong>marcie</strong>: What are those for? An Indian raid?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Steve’s got a woodlore program. You see any
life rings?</p>
<p><strong>marcie</strong>: Here. Meet me in my cabin after taps. Okay,
Camper?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: For sure.</p>
<p><strong>insert</strong>: ALICE’S SKETCH. It is a moody pierce, a
sense of foreboding dominates it. Otherwise, it is the camp’s central
compound, featuring the tree that forms the central focus.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You draw very well.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Oh, thanks. I wish I could spend more time at
it.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: This isn’t your cup of tea, hunh?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Any particular reason?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Just a feeling. Nothing personal.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You want to leave?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: I don’t know. Probably be best for
everybody.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You may not care a lot about this place,
Alice, but I mean to make it my whole life. It’s been my whole life.
Gimme a chance. Stay a week. Help get it ready. Next Friday, if you’re
not happy, I’ll put you on the bus myself. I’ll be grateful.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Next Friday.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Thanks, Alice.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I’ve got to go to town and pick up the
trailer and all that other stuff, but I’ll be back around ten. If you’re
still up, we can talk, okay?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You want it listed separately?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Yeah. Brenda, after lunch hit the archery
range. If Annie gets here, have her start in on the kitchen. Do your
best. Tomorrow we have a preliminary inspection by the state safety
people. I’d like to look good.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: He neglected to mention this place is called
“Camp Blood” downtown.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: How come?</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Some campers drowned. Then some counsellors got
killed.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: No shit. When?</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Late fifties sometime. They never caught the
guy who did it either.</p>
<p><strong>marcie</strong>: Neddy collects weird facts. Next he is going
to tell us that there are poisonous snakes in the outhouse and green
lizards in the lake.</p>
<p><strong>we see what she sees</strong>: a very cocky NED, standing by
the lean- to with a bow in his hands and three more arrows knocked
simultaneously. He has a feather stuck in his hair.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: You’re crazy!</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Did anyone ever tell you you’re beautiful when
you’re angry?</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: I don’t believe you…</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Want to see my trick shot? It’s even
better.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: You ever fire one of those bows again, and
I’ll tack you up on the wall to dry.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: God, but I love that sexy talk.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Sorry. How you doing?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Did you want something?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Steve said you were thinking of leaving.
True?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Un-hunh.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Oh, my God…</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You’re lucky.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: How come you’re leaving?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: It’s long and personal. It has nothing to do
with you or the other kids.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Maybe I can help?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: And it’s this place. It makes no sense, but
it spooks me.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You’re right. It makes no sense.</p>
<p><strong>marcie</strong>: Help me! Save me! The frog people are after
me! It’s swim time at Camp Crystal Lake. Come on, Alice, I need
protection!</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: What do you want to be when you grow up?</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Dancer.</p>
<p><strong>marcie</strong>: Cowboy.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Girls can’t be cowboys.</p>
<p><strong>marcie</strong>: Okay, Fireman.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Jack?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Coach, athletic director somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Filmmaker.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Artist.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Doctor. Now, if you were a flavor of ice cream,
what would you be?</p>
<p><strong>marcie</strong>: Rocky Road.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Vitamin C’s supposed to neutralize the
nitrites or something.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: There are sand sharks in this lake and they can
eat the bathing suit right off you.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: See? I’m getting to you. Very slowly.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: What’d you see?</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: I don’t know. Marcie’s got me paranoid.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: It still hurts?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: I walked into it knowing I’d get hurt, but I
thought I could stand anything. I just wasn’t ready for that kind of
pain. We were supposed to meet in L.A. When I got back there, he sent a
telegram saying he was going back to his wife.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: What’ll you do when you leave here?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>marcie</strong>: Pistachio, fudge ripple, creme de menthe and
I are going back to work.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Speaking as black raspberry, I guess I’m
ready. Frozen yogurt?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: I’ll be along.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Don’t burn that gorgeous body, or I’ll scratch
your eyes out…</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Not bad.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Holy shit…</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: We wouldn’t want you thinking you’re the
only show-off in camp, would we?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: I didn’t know I was asleep…What time is
it?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Almost five.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Now I’m only eleven hours behind schedule.
Steve is going to have a small cow.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You can only do what you can do.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: And then Steve looks at you with those hurt
eyes–like you don’t care about children…</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: I’ll see you later.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Alice?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: You’re very nice.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Hope you will.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Help!</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: There’s a fucking snake in here.</p>
<p><strong>marcie</strong>: Steve never mentioned serpents. Jack, would
you get some paper towels?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: How the… did he get in there?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Slipped in. Probably liked the scent of your
perfume.</p>
<p><strong>marcie</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You okay now?</p>
<p><strong>marcie</strong>: Go ahead. I walk on ’em all the time. Would
you shovel Mr. Snake outta here?</p>
<p><strong>brenda jack</strong>: She all right? Get ready for the
schneider.</p>
<p><strong>marcie bill</strong>: Yeah. Scared the hell out No chance. of
her.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: BRENDA Four zip.</p>
<p><strong>marcie</strong>: How you doin’?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Okay. Can I help?</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: It’s catch as catch can. I’m making a salad.
The guys are planning to cook greaseburgers for themselves.</p>
<p><strong>marcie</strong>: There’s a lot of dishes if you just want
something to do.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: The way I feel, that’s perfect.</p>
<p><strong>jack bill</strong>: What the hell? Where’d you get that
stuff?</p>
<p><strong>marcie brenda</strong>: Oh, Lord! Neddy!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It’s gonna be a long summer.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Wait, wait! When I was finding these goodies in
the shed. I also found this letter which a camper never sent home.
Listen.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Dear Mom and Dad, Camp Blood is real fine
except for the strange man who flies at night and sucks our counsellor’s
body…</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: And, Mommy, we really love our counsellor. He
says that whenever I’m scared, I can sleep in his bunk with him.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: No wonder they lost America. How could you
sneak around in the bushes wearing that? What’s to eat?</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Whatever you make yourself.</p>
<p><strong>reaction shot</strong>: ALICE. Curious. A cold chill…</p>
<p><strong>brenda jack</strong>: How can you eat that stuff? You like
them rare? Looks like dead animals.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: NED Too bad that Annie never</p>
<p><strong>brenda marcie</strong>: You can get all the protein No way I
am gonna play chef you need if you mix them to all of you guys. It’s
right. women’s lib from here on</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: The squaws are revolting!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Trouble?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Bad bulb or no power. It’s getting a little
gloomy in here.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Steve taught me how to use the emergency
generator. The town power lines are supposed to be real shitty.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: God, but I love that macho talk! Emergency
generators! The Indian used campfires.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Give me a hand?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: For sure.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: This is almost like the one at my uncle’s
cabin in Maine.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Here we go.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: as JACK pulls the starter cord. The
engine roars into action.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Now ya’ close the switch.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’ll be okay. Holy shit…</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Don’t get up. Take a second…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You saved my life.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I had to.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I figured if I didn’t save you. I’d have to
give you mouth-to-mouth and that would have ruined my appetite.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Whew.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: This puddle was enough to ground you all the
way to China.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Floor probably leaks. This area is full of
springs.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: A short somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: There’s the problem, Jack. Wire worked itself
loose.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Just in cause this bugger goes bad. I’m gonna
pick up some lanterns from the equipment shack.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: What hath God wrought?</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: That was the telephone.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Ha! You wily oriental! The phone was
“Mr. Watson, come in here, I need you.” “What hath God wrought” was the
telegraph.</p>
<p><strong>marcie</strong>: Last line of Gone With the Wind?</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Frankly, Scarlet, I don’t give a damn!</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Shows how much you know. It’s something
about tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Tomorrow is another day.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Right! Right!</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: This just plain ain’t my day.</p>
<p><strong>marcie ned</strong>: You okay? Those things can be nasty.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Wash it out real good.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Lemme see. Doesn’t look too bad.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Who played the role of Gorgon in Star Trek?</p>
<p><strong>bill brenda</strong>: I don’t want you getting Melvin Belli.

<p><strong>ned</strong>: ALICE Aaaargh! That my</p>

Belli?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Somebody probably dropped something too
hard.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Alice, you’re just lucky there are no snakes in
the dishwater here.</p>
<p><strong>marcie</strong>: Soooooeeeeey, piggy, piggy.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Is it stuck?</p>
<p><strong>marcie alice</strong>: Help him! Oh, my God!</p>
<p><strong>bill jack</strong>: Roll him over! Get behind him more.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Ta-da!</p>
<p><strong>reaction shots</strong>: as it sinks in that NED has been
putting them on.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Not funny, Ned…</p>
<p><strong>marcie</strong>: Wait’ll you’re really in trouble and see
what happens…</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: But it’s in the brochure! “Camp Crystal Lake
has a full drama program.” You just saw it.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Chance to get even?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’ll spot you five points.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Hey, look, I’m sorry. I’ll never do it
again.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Ned? We’re gonna be working together for a
while. You’re a nice guy without all the entertainment, okay?</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Tell ’em I’m sorry?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: I’m gonna go lie down and catch some z’s. Today
wiped me out. Thanks, Alice.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: You’re welcome.</p>
<p><strong>marcie</strong>: I hope that’s the last time we see the Camp
Crystal Lake Drama Program.</p>
<p><strong>we see what he sees</strong>: a shape–a human shape–standing
by a cabin.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Hello? Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You just had some lucky shots.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Where’s Ned?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: He went to bed early.</p>
<p><strong>marcie</strong>: I don’t blame him.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: He’s probably setting up another one of his
practical jokes.</p>
<p><strong>marcie</strong>: Yeah, like draining the lake!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hey, how about a walk by the lake?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Just a walk, for Chrissakes.</p>
<p><strong>marcie</strong>: Boy, we sure do have a lot of filthy
small-minded people around here. Wait a minute, I’ll get my diaphragm
and be right with you.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Wind’s up. It’s shifted a good hundred and
eighty degrees.</p>
<p><strong>marcie</strong>: Makes me want to hold on and never let
go.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>marcie</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>marcie</strong>: What about Neddy?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I don’t love Neddy.</p>
<p><strong>marcie</strong>: He keeps on acting like such an asshole!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Ned!</p>
<p><strong>marcie</strong>: Don’t call him.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I thought you wanted to give him one of your
motherly lectures. Ned is gonna do whatever he wants to do, you
know.</p>
<p><strong>marcie</strong>: I guess…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Looks like a storm.</p>
<p><strong>marcie</strong>: I’m a little scared of storms. Always have
been. Since I was a kid.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You? The brick?</p>
<p><strong>marcie</strong>: I’ve dreamed this dream. Maybe half a dozen
times. There is a thunderstorm. The rain comes down like pebbles. I can
hear the sound. I try to close my ears off. It doesn’t work. The sounds
gets louder. The rain turns to blood and the blood washes down in little
rivers. And the sound stops.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It’s just a dream.</p>
<p><strong>marcie</strong>: I call it my shower dream.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: This is no dream. Want to escape for a
while?</p>
<p><strong>marcie</strong>: Lead the way!</p>
<p><strong>marcie</strong>: Are you wet?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Just a little. Wait a minute, woman.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Jack and Marcie are gonna be drenched.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Not if they’re where I think they are.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: I’m not always this stupid.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: JACK and MARCIE lie completely still
beneath their blanket. The CAMERA PANS along their quiet bodies.
MARCIE’s face is contented. JACK is ready to doze off.</p>
<p><strong>marcie</strong>: Mmmmmmmph?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Mmmmmmmph.</p>
<p><strong>marcie</strong>: Best over…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Umhummmmph.</p>
<p><strong>marcie</strong>: Like waves. It’s never been likes waves
before.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Whassamatta?</p>
<p><strong>marcie</strong>: Gotta pee. You’re lying on my bladder.</p>
<p><strong>marcie</strong>: I know this ain’t very romantic, but what
can I say? I don’t want to explode.</p>
<p><strong>marcie</strong>: “Forty yards to the outhouse by Willie
Makit.” “The Yellow Stream by I.P. Daley.” Not the most original stuff,
kids.</p>
<p><strong>marcie</strong>: Jack?</p>
<p><strong>prowler’s pov</strong>: of MARCIE.</p>
<p><strong>74 mcu marcie</strong>: She rinses her hands, shakes them dry
and</p>
<p><strong>marcie</strong>: Jack?</p>
<p><strong>marcie</strong>: Jack? Neddy? Don’t put me on.</p>
<p><strong>marcie</strong>: Allee allee infree!</p>
<p><strong>marcie</strong>: Must be my imagination.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Anything else you want?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: No, thanks. I’m fine. Sandy.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: You can’t go back there tonight. Not in that
stuff. ’Less you wanta get drownded.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I got to.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Aw.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I have six new counsellor up there. They’re
all babes in the woods in every sense of the word.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: They’ll be okay if they know enough to stay
in outta the rain.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: One night on the town.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I mean…</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: …I know what you mean. Two and a quarter.
Plus fifteen percent tip to make up for me spending the night alone.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: You got a roof for that Jeep?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Yeah. I got it on before this– –all
started.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: That’s thirty percent.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: For two lonely nights.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Drive careful and don’t drownd your dumb
self.</p>
<p><strong>prowler’s pov</strong>: From outside the cabin, we can see
some activity in the big meeting room. The CAMERA moves slightly from
left to right as the shot is established. Then an unseen hand releases a
branch which partially blocks the shot.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: You think they fell asleep?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Anything’s possible. My parents taught me to
leave sleeping lovers alone.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: It wouldn’t matter except Steve should be
getting back pretty soon. It wouldn’t look so great if he fell over
them.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Good point.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Well, it hasn’t been that long.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Long enough for me.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: I think we should go wake them up. Just in
case.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Give them a little while longer. It’s still
early, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: I guess…</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Got to it just in time. The generator was
running on fumes. I filled it up. That should keep it humming until
Steve gets back.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Good night, Alice.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Good night, Brenda.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Help you clean up?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>tierney</strong>: I told you not to buy that hunk of
junk!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I think water got into the electrical system.
You ride me back to camp? I’ll get one of my counsellors to drive me
back tomorrow morning.</p>
<p><strong>tierney</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>tierney</strong>: “To serve and protect” don’t mean to
chauffeur.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: That could drive a person bug-city.</p>
<p><strong>another angle, closer</strong>: as BRENDA hears the tapping
sound closer by. She looks and sees.</p>
<p><strong>we see what she sees</strong>: somebody has ties a kitchen
knife to a string and left it dangling from the eaves. The wind blows,
making the knife tap against the building.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Neddy? Cut the screwing around, Neddy!</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: This isn’t even half funny.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Christ, what a jerk.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Great. Now what?</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Looks like I turn in early.</p>
<p><strong>reaction shot</strong>: Fear spreads across her face.</p>
<p><strong>reverse pov</strong>: WE SEE WHAT SHE SEES: A camp hatchet
lies across her pillow. The shiny blade is marked with blood.</p>
<p><strong>close up</strong>: a hand reaches in and slams on a circuit
breaker.</p>
<p><strong>close up</strong>: Two large spot lights on a telephone pole
light up.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: I don’t here it anymore.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Can’t hear anything through that wind and
rain.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: It sounded like Brenda.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I’ll go take a look.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Did somebody leave the lights on at the
softball field?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: They’re off now.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I’ll go check on Brenda.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: I’ll go with you.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: If it’ll make you feel better.</p>
<p><strong>tierney</strong>: Bad enough we got a full moon; it’s Friday
the 13th. They keep statistics. We get more accidents, more robberies,
more rapes, more homicides, more of everything when there’s a full moon.
It affects people. Makes ’em nuts.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You’ve made a science out of coincidence.</p>
<p><strong>dispatcher #1</strong>: Sgt. Tierney, Report.</p>
<p><strong>dispatcher #2</strong>: Need a clear frequency…</p>
<p><strong>dispatcher #1</strong>: Sgt. Tierney, car niner.</p>
<p><strong>tierney</strong>: This is Tierney.</p>
<p><strong>dispatcher #2</strong>: Rescue squad with jaws of life… near
mile marker 17… possible fatals… three, maybe more… head on… at least
one trapped…</p>
<p><strong>dispatcher #1</strong>: Sgt. Tierney, there’s a bad accident.
One fatality known, several possibles near mile marker 17 on the
Interstate. Bus, tractor trailer. Over.</p>
<p><strong>tierney</strong>: Roger. Acknowledge receipt. Estimate
arrival time fifteen minutes. How copy?</p>
<p><strong>dispatcher #1</strong>: 100%. I’ll tell ’em you’ll be there
in fifteen minutes. Out.</p>
<p><strong>tierney</strong>: Have to drop you here, Steve.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>tierney</strong>: Another coincidence.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: as STEVE turns and jogs the other
way. Low thunder rolls in the distance.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Brenda? Brenda? You there?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Bill.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: WE SEE WHAT THEY SEE: the bloody
hatchet left on Brenda’s pillow.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: What the fuck is going on here?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Jack?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Marcie?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Hey, guys!</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Marcie? Brenda? Jack?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: I think we should call the police, Bill.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Sucker’s locked. Who’s got the key?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: It’s dead. Try the pay phone.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Do you have a dime? A quarter?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: No. There must be some in the desk
somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Hello? Hello? This damn thing’s dead,
too.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: What’s the matter with it?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Wet. I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Why don’t we run? Just run now?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: It’s over twenty miles to the crossroads.
Steve’ll be back in an hour. Things will straighten out then. We’ll take
his Jeep and get help.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Don’t worry. There is probably some really
stupid explanation for all this. When the sun comes up tomorrow, you’ll
smile. Promise.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Hi. What are you doing out in this mess?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Oh, shit….</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Bill?!</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: The generator…</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Bill? Bill?</p>
<p><strong>117 insert</strong>: Whistling tea kettle on the kitchen
stove.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Bill!</p>
<p><strong>reaction shot</strong>: ALICE decides to pull harder.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Bill?</p>
<p><strong>reaction shot</strong>: ALICE. She is riveted with horror,
unable to move or turn or run. The SOUNDTRACK screams with the THEME,
the insistent STINGER, a shriek and a thunderclap.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Help! Help!</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Jack! Marcie! Help me!</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: The knife!</p>
<p><strong>low angle</strong>: as she scrabbles on all fours. Nothing
under the couch.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. voorhees</strong>: There now, my dear. Please. I can’t
help you if you can’t talk to me. There, there now…</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: He’s dead… She’s dead… all dead… Please save
me… oh… poor Bill… Oh my God, oh my God… oh God…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. voorhees</strong>: It will be all right. I’ll take care
of you.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Jack? Marcie? Ned?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. voorhees</strong>: It’s just this place. The storm.
That’s why you’re all upset.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: No, no, they’re all dead…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. voorhees</strong>: I’ll go look.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: They’ll kill you! Don’t leave me!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. voorhees</strong>: I’m not afraid.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: All dead? Neddy? Oh, Marcie…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. voorhees</strong>: Oh, my lord…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. voorhees</strong>: So young, so pretty. What monster
could have done such a thing?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Bill–Bill–Bill is out there…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. voorhees</strong>: We shall go straight to the
police.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: The killer is still out there.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. voorhees</strong>: I will protect you.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. voorhees</strong>: Oh, this place… It should never have
been a camp. Not for children. They had so much trouble here.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. voorhees</strong>: Camp Blood.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. voorhees</strong>: You know a boy drowned the year
before those two others were killed? An accident? It was inadequate
supervision. The counsellors were not paying enough attention… They were
making love when that boy drowned.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: MCU as the OLDER WOMAN’s hand strokes
the YOUNGER WOMAN’s hair. The hand is missing its little finger!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. voorhees</strong>: We should go now.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Maybe we should wait for Mr. Christy.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. voorhees</strong>: No. That won’t be necessary.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Help me, mommy… save me… please, mommy…
please, mommy… help me, mommy… save me….</p>
<p><strong>mrs. voorhees</strong>: I am, Jason. I am.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Why shouldn’t we wait for Mr. Christy?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. voorhees</strong>: It was my son they killed. They said
he drowned, but I know it was inadequate supervision…</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Mr. Christy will be back soon.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. voorhees</strong>: No, he won’t. I killed him as
well….</p>
<p><strong>mrs. voorhees</strong>: I couldn’t let them start this camp
again, could I?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: I won’t let you!</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: No! No! No!</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: as ALICE runs out into the rain, the
mud, the thunder and the lightning. The THEME is going full-tilt as
ALICE makes a quick turn to run towards the road.</p>
<p><strong>two-shot</strong>: as ALICE bumps into an object which swings
from above. A slice of lightning reveals it to be the dead body of STEVE
CHRISTY hanging from the tree. A rope is looped under his arms, his head
is down on his chest, and a long blade protrudes from his heart.</p>
<p><strong>reaction shot</strong>: ALICE in terror.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: ALICE runs and suddenly bumps into
another pair of legs which swing from the same big tree.</p>
<p><strong>strobe shot</strong>: of JACK, dead.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: ALICE runs for the Arts &amp; Crafts.
In the BG we see can the yellow-slickered MRS. VOORHEES closing the
distance between herself and ALICE.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: MRS. VOORHEES opens the door and
walks in a few feet.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Help, mommy, I’m drowning! Oh, mommy,
please….</p>
<p><strong>mrs. voorhees</strong>: I can’t let them kill any more
children. Come out now.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Kill her, mommy! Kill her!</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: The door is thrown back. ALICE goes
in. Looks for a weapon. Nothing is available. ALICE sobs with fear. She
runs.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Where are the goddamned bullets?</p>
<p><strong>angle on alice</strong>: She whacks the hasp with the butt of
the rifle. The hasp doesn’t give. She gives it another butt stroke. It
won’t give. A shadow covers ALICE’s back. She turns.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: MRS. VOORHEES is standing in the
doorway, blocking the light. Still carrying the machete, MRS. VOORHEES
steps slowly toward ALICE.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Please kill her, mommy… Help me, please. Kill
her, mommy.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Come out, come out, wherever you are…</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Please…</p>
<p><strong>reaction shot</strong>: ALICE… oh, my God…</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: MRS. VOORHEES lies totally inert.
There is a small puddle of blood under her head.</p>
<p><strong>angle on alice</strong>: She relaxes, puts down her weapon
and crosses slowly out of the room.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Help me.</p>
