<h1 id="the-hangover">the-hangover</h1>
<p><strong>mr. turner</strong>: Any word from Doug?</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: No, but I’m sure he’s–</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>vick lennon</strong>: He’s in his late 20’s, tall, rugged –
and currently a mess. His shirt is ripped open, his aviator sunglasses
are bent, his lip is bloodied, and he clearly hasn’t slept in days.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Tracy, it’s Vick.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Hey Vick!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Listen, honey…The bachelor party got a little
out of control and, well…we lost Doug.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: What?! But we’re getting married in like four
hours!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Yeah, that’s not gonna happen.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Dude this is already the best weekend ever!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Stu, relax, we’re still on the 10.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Oh, did I show you pictures of my kids?!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: No, dude, show `em.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Haylee is two, and Kaitlin is already four! Can
you believe it?!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: How cute… Good for you, man.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: The one on the left is gonna be a hottie. The
other one, not so much.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Jesus, dude, those are my children–</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Hey, am I rubbed in?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Yeah, you’re good.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Hey so Alan, are you and Becky still
together?</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Of course they are, Doug. Jesus, Alan’s been
dating Becky for 14 years. When they first met, Alan had braces and
soccer hair, and Becky had a functioning hymen.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Asking Alan if he’s still with Becky is like
asking the sun if it still rises in the east.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: She still pressuring you to get married?</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Enh, we’ve moved past the pressure stage…it’s
more like aggravated assault stage now? Like at the last wedding we went
to, she threw a camera at my head, called me a closet fag, then ran out
crying.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: But we talked, and everything’s cool now.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Maybe you could wear a helmet to Doug’s
wedding.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Great idea, Stu. Thanks.</p>
<p>****: So Vick, how’s business going?</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Oh, great. Yeah, I’m working on bringing the
next big dessert craze to Los Angeles. It’s gonna be huge.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Bavarian custard. We ran the numbers, and it’s
gonna be bigger than fro yo.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Isn’t custard like a trillion calories–?</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Our plan is to open three stores in the Valley
and then franchise it. Shares are selling fast, but I can probably
squeeze you guys in…</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Yeah, man, count me in.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Me too, man! I love pudding!</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Is this gonna do better than the hip-hop label
you started, Vick? Or the topless sushi bar? Or the mobile tattoo
parlor–?</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Tattoo-To-You was an idea ahead of it’s time,
Alan! And don’t come crying to me when there’s a Custard Cabana on every
street corner in America and you didn’t buy in–!</p>
<p>****: All right, all right, save it for the party…</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Dude! I can’t believe I get to party all night,
and then, tomorrow …I get to sleep in! It’s almost too much! And FYI, if
anyone gets really drunk and craps themself, just let me know, I can
have you cleaned up and partying again in under three minutes. No joke.
I am a master of stool removal…</p>
<p><strong>the front desk</strong>: A perfectly pressed LEBANESE MAN
waits behind the front desk. Vick strides up, smiling, sunglasses still
on.</p>
<p><strong>front desk man</strong>: Welcome to the Mandalay Bay.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Checking in. Lennon comma Victor.</p>
<p><strong>front desk man</strong>: Yes, we have you down for a one
night stay in an economy suite–</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Hold it right there, Atashir. This is my best
friend from childhood, Douglas Billings. In two days, he is to marry a
woman of great beauty and strong teeth, do you understand? A woman of
gigantic bosoms who will give him many, many sons…</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: My two other childhood friends have travelled
great distances, across many deserts, to be here. This isn’t a night in
a hotel for us, Atashir: this is a family reunion. Perhaps you too have
family situated great distances away, in a foreign country with much
sand?</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Then I have but one question for you, friend:
if they came to town, would you put them in an economy suite?</p>
<p><strong>atashir</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Well, then. I think one of us needs to get
back on his little computer and find us a suitable room.</p>
<p><strong>atashir</strong>: All the deluxe rooms are taken. The Dean
Martin suite is available, but I’d have to ask my–</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Dean-o will be fine. Send up a case of
Cristal, two bottles of Patron, four ahi sandwiches, and a crate of
skinless mangos…</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: You guys want anything?</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: And have Jean-Marie cook up a dozen of those
duck skewers I like so well. He knows the ones.</p>
<p><strong>atashir</strong>: And how would you like to pay?</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: American Express.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Dude, give him your AmEx.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Don’t worry, we’ll hit you later.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Dude, come on, I paid for gas. Stop being such
a Jew.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: This is bigger than my house.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Get dressed, ladies. We’re wheels up in
ten.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: I am so not getting paid back.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: This is Vick.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: He’s in Vegas?! You’re kidding me!</p>
<p>****: All right, I’ll get it. All right. All right–!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: I said all right, dude! How many more times
you want me to say all right?!</p>
<p>****: All right. All right.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: So, you ready for Sunday?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Yeah. I thought I’d be nervous, but I’m
actually just really psyched.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Tracy’s dad still hate you?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Oh yeah.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Any closer to figuring out why?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Enh, I think he wanted more for his girl. I
mean, I’m a teacher who makes 45 grand a year, and he’s a titan of
industry who makes 45 grand a day, you know? I sort of get it… Also, I’m
banging his daughter. I’m not sure you ever get past that.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: You got floss?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Holy Christ!</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Ahhh yeah, I wasn’t going to tell anyone about
that–</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Anyone got any nipple lube–? Jesus would you
look at the size of that thing?!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: It’s Alan’s. For Becky.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Jesus, who made this thing? Diddy?</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Actually, I-I was trying to keep it a secret,
so–</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Boy Party in the bathrooooom–! Miner’s cut,
2.6 Carats, slight pink tint, street value: 26, 27K.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Dude, it’s for Becky! Alan’s finally going to
propose!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Well gosh-golly, Alan Mervish, good for you!
Where’d you get the ring?</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Oh, it’s a family heirloom. My grandmother
smuggled it through the Holocaust, actually. I was going to propose to
Beck this weekend.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Well: now we have two things to celebrate!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Thish is so great! I love you guys!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Check it out, Stu’s already wasted.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: We’ve only had two shots, man!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Yeah, what happened, Stuey?! You used to be
able to drink us all under the table!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Dude, I’m a dad! I don’t have time to get
plastered anymore! It blows!</p>
<p>****: Am I a bad dad for saying that?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: What? No!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Because my dad was a bad dad.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: That’s true, Stuey, but you’re different.
We’ve talked about this.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Have I showed you guys pictures of my kids
yet–?</p>
<p><strong>yes!</strong>: Doug laughs and raises his glass for a toast,
heartfelt:</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Little toast: to Tracy, the coolest, kindest,
most beautiful woman I’ve ever met. I can’t believe she let me come this
weekend – much less agreed to spend the rest of her life with me. I
think both will prove to be massive errors of judgement on her part.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: And to being here, with my best friends in the
world. There’s nowhere else I’d rather be.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: That said, let’s not get too stupid tonight,
okay? I’m getting married in 36 hours.</p>
<p><strong>alan &amp; stu &amp; vick</strong>: No, no. / We’ll be good.
/ Totally, dude.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I’m serious, dudes! Nothing above the neck –
no piercings, no weird haircuts, no facial tattoos. I gotta look decent
on Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Jesus, what do you take us for?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Vick: you shaved Alan’s eyebrows off the night
before graduation!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Oh yeah! That was hilarious! And remember when
I blacked out at Homecoming and you wrote on my face with permanent
marker?! That was awesome! What’d you write again?</p>
<p><strong>alan &amp; doug &amp; vick</strong>: “Respect me!”</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Ahh, good times, man. Good times…</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: We’ll be good tonight, Doug.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Seriously, man, we’re your friends.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Yeah, we’ve totally grown up since then.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Well then…to a night we’ll never forget.</p>
<p><strong>the next morning</strong>: Shafts of white desert sunlight
pour into</p>
<p><strong>the dean martin suite</strong>: THE CAMERA follows a LIVE
CHICKEN as it walks through the totalled suite. Furniture is broken, the
minibar ransacked, and the floor is covered with remnants of the night
before: empty beer cans, platefuls of room service food, a cowboy hat,
the Gideon Bible, half-eaten skinless mangos, a bra, a battle axe, etc.
SNORING on the couch, wearing only his jeans and one shoe, the word
ASSHOLE written in Sharpie across his chest, is Stu.</p>
<p><strong>title card: “saturday, 11:15am”</strong>: The chicken struts
across the top of the couch, until it reaches a plastic coin cup from
Bellagio blocking its path. Beat. Then the chicken pecks it off…onto
Stu. The cup hits Stu in the face, and stale beer splashes all over him.
Stu spastically jerks awake and flips off the couch, onto a pile of
newspapers.</p>
<p><strong>pile of newspapers</strong>: OWW! Get off! Get off!
Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Damn, dude, why are you retarded?</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Um, Stuey?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Yo.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Why do you have a mullet?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: You know, business on top, party down the
back?</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Your hair, dude. You have a mullet.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Dude…I have a mullet.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Just give me ten more minutes, Beck…</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Whoa, did you sleep in the tub?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Check it out: Alan slept in the tub.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Get him up. I’m hungry.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Wet. Water. Jesus, what’s–?!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Jesus, dude, put away your sack.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Yeah, and it might be time for some manscaping,
bro. Your bush looks like Yanni.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: What did we do last night?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Dude, why is my ass killing me…?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: We’ll…we’ll get the next one.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: We might not smell very good.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: This might be the worst hangover anyone has
ever had, ever.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: I can’t taste anything.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Please stop talking. If I don’t focus on
eating I’m going to throw up all over myself.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Hey… Are we missing something?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Yes: I left my hat in the room – thank you,
Alan.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: No. That’s not it… There’s something else…</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: You gonna finish that cruller?</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Doug. Guys, where’s Doug?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Yeah. He’s not here.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Probably left him in the room.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: I’ll call his cell.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Good morning, this is Stu?</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: It’s me, meatdick.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: It’s Vick–</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: This is Doug’s phone.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: You calling the room?</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: No answer.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Ummm…shouldn’t we look for him? Check-out is
in like ten minutes.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Yeah, and we told Tracy we’d have Doug back to
LA by five.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: I’m eabing.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: What an asshole. Stu, check the pool and the
casino, I’ll check the room and the gym. Maybe he’s working out or
something…</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: And Vick, if you could keep a close eye on the
buffet, that’d be really helpful. Thanks, man.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Doug…? Doug…? Wake up, man.</p>
<p><strong>the bed is missing</strong>: There are four indentations on
the carpet where it once lay. Alan scratches his head.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: That’s weird…</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: No, no. It’s cool, I’m a dad. It’s totally
cool…</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: I hate you all…</p>
<p><strong>doug! doug!</strong>: Two GAY MEN in identical tank tops pass
by, holding hands.</p>
<p><strong>gay man</strong>: Hey Stu.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Hey guys. DOUG! DOUG–!</p>
<p><strong>the reception desk</strong>: He slowly bow-legs himself
over.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: You find Doug?</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: No, I assume you didn’t either?</p>
<p><strong>atashir</strong>: There is no Doug Billings at any of the
area hospitals, morgues, or police stations.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Maybe he went for a jog?</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Dude. It’s 120 degrees outside.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Or shopping?</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Great. So we’ve officially lost Doug. His
wedding is in what, 22 hours?</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Relax, it’s Doug, he’s probably crashed out on
someone’s couch right now. All we have to do is retrace our steps from
last night, and we’ll find him.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Okay, so last night…</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Well, we started on the roof…</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Right, that was like, 6ish…?</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Then…I think…we had steaks at the Palm?</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Yeah. Then…we played craps at the Hard
Rock…maybe?</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: That sounds right…</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Okay, honestly? I don’t even remember going to
dinner.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: I vaguely recall…doing body shots ….at some
point? Is that…maybe?</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: I’m pretty much blank after The Hard Rock.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: I think we went to the Flamingo after that…?
And then, I just remember a lot of blue light…and the overpowering smell
of baby oil.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: So that was what, 10ish?</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Give or take.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Was Doug still with us?</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Yes. Yes. Doug was with us. I tackled him…for
some reason.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Okay. So we only have a 13 hour window where
we could’ve lost him.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Hey! Look, we were at the Flamingo.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: ATM receipt from the Rio at 10:37– For 600
dollars?!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: The valet ticket says we returned here at
4:57AM.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: We drove last night?</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Here’s a receipt from Sbarro. The meal was
comped for some reason–</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Why do we have a matchbook from The Golden
Pony All Male Revue?</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Someone could’ve given that to us.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Yeah, totally! There’s no way we went there!
We’re not gay! Hahaha!</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: I think we should call Tracy.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Absolutely not.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: What if Doug called her? She might know where
he is.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Yeah, I’m with Alan on this one.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Of course you’re with Alan, you’re both
gutless cowards. But we’re not calling Tracy. You never call the bride
from the bachelor party. Ever. If my balls were on fire and Tracy was
sitting next door with a tall glass of water, I still wouldn’t call her.
It’s a rule.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: But shouldn’t we at least tell her we’re gonna
be getting home late?</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: She has a watch, she’ll figure it out.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: I think I’m beginning to see why you’re always
single.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: And I think I’m beginning to see why you’re
always a douche–</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Guys, wait. I need your help – oh my God – like
right now. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Jesus, what is it?</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: I can’t believe we’re doing this.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: You don’t have to look up my butt, just at it.
Something is terribly, terribly wrong…</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Sweet mother of mercy…</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Who’s Roger?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I-I-I don’t know?! What do you think it
means?!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: What do I think it means? Well, Stuart, your
ass is all torn up and you’re wearing thong underwear declaring your
love for another dude – I don’t think we need the CSI team for this one!
You got reamed last night, man!</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: I’m sure there’s a perfectly logical
explanation for this…</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Really?! What?!</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Yeah, maybe there isn’t.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Look, I’m sure Roger is a very nice,
considerate young man–</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Oh my God, guys: what if I’m gay?!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Come on, Stu, you’re nowhere near cool
enough.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I do watch Dancing With The Stars with the
kids!</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Oh god, that doesn’t mean you’re gay.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: But sort of…it does?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: And once, I caught myself gazing at a topless
photo of David Beckham!</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: So what, he’s a great-looking dude–</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: And then I had those weird feelings for Vick
that time in middle school, remember?!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Um, what?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Yeah, that weekend we were all camping – I told
you this.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Yeah, no you didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I didn’t?</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: I think I’d remember, dude.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Yeah, I think we’d all remember.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Yeah. I had weird feelings for you that
weekend. Like really hot, really gay feelings. But then they went
away.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Wait – I was there that weekend. Did you have
gay feelings for me?</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Unbelievable.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: What?! I was a good-looking kid!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Please, you’re so not his type!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Wait, what?</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Look, Stu, one homosexual experience doesn’t
mean you’re permanently gay, okay? A lot of guys test the waters.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: All right, we’re scaring the children. Let’s
go.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Wait – so have either of you tested the
waters?</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: No! We’re not gay!</p>
<p><strong>the casino floor</strong>: The guys power through the crowded
casino, towards the exit. Stu tries to keep up, genuinely concerned.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: How am I going to tell my wife?</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Quickly, and from a great distance.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Jesus, what kind of father am I?</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Oh my God.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: You think Erin will try to take the kids–?</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Oh…my…God.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: What now?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Cool ring. Also, my Dad is gonna have a field
day with this.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Oh my God… Oh my God…</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: What’s the big–? Oh! OH! OH!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Maybe it’s not a wedding ring?</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: “To My Noble Husband, Alan.”</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: This is worse than my underwear!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: “Now &amp; Forever Wedding Chapel.”</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Well, at least it’s a lead.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: So, we go to the wedding chapel, we find out
what we did with Doug, we recover him, and we’re back in LA before
sundown. Easy as Stu’s ass.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Check it out, some idiot threw his bed out the
window last night.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: That was us, dude.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Yeah, there’s no bed in Doug’s room.</p>
<p>****: Oh. Well, I’m sure we had a good reason for doing it.</p>
<p>****: You think they’ll charge us for–?</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Yeah, Stu, I really do.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Guys, relax. Everything’s gonna be cool…</p>
<p><strong>vick’s destroyed cadillac</strong>: The exterior is scratched
and filthy, like it’s been off- roading. The hubcaps are gone, as is the
front passenger side door. A wisp of STEAM trails up from under the
hood. The guys just stand there, agape.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: You okay, Vick?</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: I’m not emotionally prepared to talk about it
just yet, Stuart, but thank you.</p>
<p><strong>the guys rolling down the strip</strong>: in their ridiculous
car. Cars full of FAMILIES, cute GIRLS, even NUNS, point and stare. Our
guys just face forward, each quietly suffering in their own personal
Hell.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Seriously: what am I gonna tell Becky? For 14
years she’s been begging me to get married…</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Well, now you did. Just not to her.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Wait, is that homeless guy wearing Doug’s
shirt?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Naaah.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Yeah, that was a different shirt.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Left turn.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: What if they don’t remember us–?</p>
<p><strong>aaaayyyyy!</strong>: The guys turn to find the hirsute owner
of the chapel, STEVE GIANOPOLUS, 40’s, in a tight white suit, his arms
spread wide. Steve is all Vegas, by way of Long Island.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: How are you, you dumb bastards?!</p>
<p><strong>alan and the boys are here!</strong>: You here to pick up
your wedding photos?!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Does the pope wear a funny hat?! Let’s do this
thing!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: And where is Chastity today?</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: W-Who’s…Chastity?</p>
<p>****: Your wife, man–! AWW, you’re just breaking my balls!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Uh, it was such a lovely ceremony, wasn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Hand to God, I’ve never seen two people more
in love!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Sadly, I believe you…</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Hello, Chastity…</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: I am never…ever…drinking again.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Jesus, she is stacked.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Stu, please, show some class. That’s Alan’s
wife you’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Sorry. She looks really nice.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: We got a unicorn?!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Oh, yeah, you got the entire Double Camelot
Package.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: A-And how much did that cost?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: 7 thousand dollars.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Yeah, you didn’t want to get it, either, but
Vick insisted.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: I’m gonna kill you!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: You can’t put a pricetag on love, Alan! OW!
You just can’t!</p>
<p><strong>stop fighting immediately!</strong>: The guys straighten like
schoolboys as Steve’s wife CARLA, 40’s, enters. She’s wearing a toga,
smoking a menthol, and dollying in several large CARDBOARD BOXES. Then
she grins:</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Ahhh! I’m just busting your nuts!</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Good to see you, you stupid mooks!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: It’s good to be seen, Carla. It’s good to be
seen.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: I brought the rest of your package.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: First: Two dozen commuter mugs…</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: No way! Awesome!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: A hundred DVDs of the ceremony…</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: For you and Chastity to watch on your
anniversary…</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: The velvet wall hanging…</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: And it looks like real velvet, Alan, so no
machine wash, okay?</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: And the big finish:</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I want a shield!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Me too! Hey, can Stu and I get a shield?</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: I don’t suppose you have any sort of return
policy, do you?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Um…if you know another couple who looks
exactly like you guys, and who want two dozen commuter mugs, a wall
hanging, and a shield…sure.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: What.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Oh, hey Becky! Hi!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: That’s his girlfriend of 14 years. I’m sure
this’ll only take a minute…</p>
<p><strong>becky</strong>: in her Laura Ashley bedroom, angrily packing
up her suitcase. She’s beautiful and preppy in pearls and a sweater
set.</p>
<p><strong>becky</strong>: Can you tell me why all the goddamn credit
cards are maxed out?!</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: No! I-I have no idea–!</p>
<p><strong>why’d you pick doug?!</strong>: Alan waves at them, shut the
hell up! But Becky has heard.</p>
<p><strong>becky</strong>: “Your best man?!” What’s going on there,
Alan?!</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Nothing! Baby, nothing, the GUYS</p>
<p><strong>bogart a few?!</strong>: Alan furiously flips them off, shut
up!</p>
<p><strong>becky</strong>: I really don’t appreciate being mocked right
now, Alan, especially about wedding-related issues. You know how hard
this weekend is going to be for me.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: I know, baby! I know–</p>
<p><strong>becky</strong>: So you’ll call the credit card company and
straighten this out?</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Yes. I will. I promise.</p>
<p><strong>becky</strong>: Okay. Okay… Look, sorry I’m so tense… I’ll
see you soon, okay? Love you.</p>
<p><strong>becky</strong>: Alan? Hello? I said I love you?!</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Yes, no, I love you too!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Hey, how’s Becky doing, man?!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Yeah, did she ask about us?!</p>
<p><strong>steve and the guys schlepping all of the wedding
crap</strong>: through the strip mall parking lot, back to their car.
Alan sullenly carries the GIANT BRONZE SHIELD.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Look on the bright side, Alan. Vick found a
great clue.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Turns out Doug was in all the wedding photos,
which means – if the time stamp was right – we had him in our possession
until 11 pm.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: That’s another hour of last night that we can
account for. Isn’t that great?</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Amazing.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Hey, Steve, you don’t happen to know where we
were heading when we left here last night, do you?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Well, the Double Camelot Package comes with a
five course wedding feast, so I assume you went there.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Great – where was the feast?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Sbarro, over in the Fremont mall.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: I paid 7 grand for Sbarro?!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Your negativity is like a little black cloud
over our car, Alan. You’ve got to let go of this.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Let go of what, exactly, Vick?! The fact that
I married a complete stranger last night? Or that my girlfriend’s about
to leave me? Or that I’m broke? Which one?!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: You’re broke? I thought you were</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: I know you think it’s like terminally uncool
to be in a committed relationship, Vick, but I actually love Becky,
okay?</p>
<p>****: I-I honestly don’t know what I’d do without her…I really
don’t…</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Alan. Honey. Have you considered, even for a
second, that maybe the things we do when we’re drunk are what we
secretly want to do?</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Yeah, no, you’re absolutely right, Vick, I’ve
always secretly wanted to marry a bottle blonde with big fake melon tits
named Chastity!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I ain’t mad atcha, dude…</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Or, after 14 years, maybe you don’t have the
balls to leave Becky, and this is your way of getting her to leave
you.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: I was going to propose to her this weekend,
you jackass!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: All the more reason to freak out.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: I love you, Alan Mervish, I do, but you’ve
always had a major pole up your ass. Maybe last night was your inner
cool person trying to get out-</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: I swear to God, Vick, if you say one more word
to me, I will destroy you.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Guys, come on, let’s not use our angry
words–</p>
<p><strong>smash!</strong>: A baseball bat SHATTERS the windshield! The
guys all jump! Vick slams on the brakes!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: What the–?!</p>
<p><strong>kalolo fanalua</strong>: Get out of the car, Vick.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Who are these guys?!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Stu, please. I think there’s been some sort of
mistake, Mister…?</p>
<p><strong>kalolo fanalua</strong>: I’m Mr. Shut The Hell Up And Get The
Hell Outta The Car, and this is my associate, Mr. Smash You In The Teeth
If You Say Another Word.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Those so aren’t their real names.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Vick, don’t be a dick–!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Alan? Relax. These men aren’t going to hurt
us. They’re from Hawaii.</p>
<p><strong>smash! smash! smash!</strong>: Kikiolani starts viciously
smashing the car!</p>
<p><strong>kalolo fanalua</strong>: We’re from Guam, bitch! Now get
outta the car!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Okay, okay! Cool it with the bat! Jesus, why
is everyone trying to kill my car…?</p>
<p><strong>floors it out of there in reverse!</strong>: The Caddy
sideswipes a car, hops the curb, and lands on the street! They SQUEAL
AWAY, the huge bronze shield flying out of the backseat as they do! It
CLATTERS on the pavement…</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Why’d you do that?!</p>
<p>****: Really?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Maybe they just wanted to talk!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: I honestly don’t know how you two are still
alive.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Do you think we stole something from them last
night?!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Oh my god I am such a bad dad!</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: I’m calling the police. This is getting way
out of control–</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: No! No cops!</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: “No cops?!” Who are you, Fitty Cent?!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Yeah, Vick, what’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Nothing! I just think we should focus on
finding Doug and not get distracted by every little thing!</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Every little thing?! We were just assaulted by
the Yakuza!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Oh please, those guys are from Guam. Get a
grip.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: They knew your name, Vick! Which means they
probably know who Stu and I are, too!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: If anything ever happened to my family,
Vick…</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Fine. Let’s just go back to the hotel – Doug
is probably back from wherever he spent the night, we’ll get him, we’ll
straighten out whatever we did to those angry Samoans, then we’ll get
the hell back to LA, okay? Left turn.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Doug? Doug?</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: No messages.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Come on, let’s toss the place.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Hey, check it out, Vick! I invested 30 grand in
your custard store last night!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Smart move, man.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Hey, you wanna come in here a sec?!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Whoa.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: You think she’s what those Guamian dudes
wanted?</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: No. I think she’s Alan’s wife.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Alan? Wanna step in here, buddy?</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Alan, Chastity. Chastity, Alan.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: What…what am I supposed to do?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Wake her up, man!</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Why me?!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Because she’s your spouse, dude!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Pinch her tit. It always works.</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: Dang, did I sleep in the closet
again…?</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: Oh hey, guys! What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: Morning, honey…</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: She seems really cool.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Yeah, I really like her, man.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: So, um, did you take Alan’s name?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Yeah, are you Chastity Mervish now–?</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Listen to me. Just…did we, or did we not, have
sex last night?</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: Well…ya?</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: But we waited til we were married.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: What a responsible, upstanding young Jew. They
don’t make `em like that anymore, am I right?</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: I know – he even wanted to use a
rubber.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Wait– we didn’t use a condom?!</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: It’s cool, I sponge.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Can someone…please open a window?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: They don’t open.</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: So you guys don’t remember any of last
night?</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Yeah, not so much.</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: Hey, been there before, right? Sucks,
though. The wedding was really fun. I’m bummed you don’t remember it,
Alan.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Dude, I think your wife’s mad at you.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: You don’t happen to remember what time we met
you last night, do you?</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: Sure, we met at the bar at like 10:00?
Then we got married on my smoke break, which was like 11:00?</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: It’s the All-American love story, isn’t it?
What happened next?</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: Well, I had to go back to work. But when I
got off at 5:30, I met up with you guys back here.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: And was Doug with us then?</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Interesting… Do you have any idea where we
went after the wedding?</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: No, but I bet some of my work friends do.
You were partying with them pretty hard.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Work friends?</p>
<p><strong>strippers</strong>: Dozens of `em, dancing, grinding,
shimmying on poles.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: You work here?</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: Yeah – and this is the pole where we first
met!</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: It’s always been my lucky pole…</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Look, I don’t know how to tell you this,
but–</p>
<p><strong>hey platinum, check it out!</strong>: She holds up her hand,
showing off ALAN’S GRANDMOTHER’S RING to the stripper currently
upside-down on the pole.</p>
<p><strong>platinum the stripper</strong>: Get it, girl!</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: Come on, let’s go meet my bridesmaids!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Dude.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: The Holocaust, man.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Look, we can get your grandmother’s ring back.
We just gotta go about it in the right way.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: I have besmirched my people.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Don’t be so hard on yourself, dude–</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: These were my bridesmaids, Anastasia and
Starr!</p>
<p><strong>starr</strong>: Hey, boys! Good to see you again!</p>
<p><strong>anastasia</strong>: Mazel Tov–!</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Please…don’t.</p>
<p><strong>couple, chastity and alannnn!</strong>: The entire club
CHEERS! Chastity holds up her wedding ring and dances around, WOO HOO!
Alan waves meekly. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: Oh my God, he’s playing our song! This
song was playing when we met, remember?! You kept sliding twenties into
my thong and saying “I will always love you. I will always love
you.”</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Twenties?</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: Yeah, it was so sweet…</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Look, I don’t know how to say this, but my
friends and I were very drunk last night. We would never come to a place
like this–</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Guys?</p>
<p><strong>vick and stu toasting shots of jagermeister</strong>: and
downing them. PULL BACK to see that they are sitting in</p>
<p><strong>the champagne room</strong>: getting lapdances from STARR and
ANASTASIA. The Champagne Room is a dark, plush private suite in the back
of the Crazy Horse where strippers ply their craft; the room is half
full. Vick watches Starr lean over and make out with Anastasia.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: You are the best bridesmaids ever.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Dude: I might not be gay.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: What the hell are you doing?!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Two-for-ones, man.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: We don’t have time for this! We gotta find
Doug!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: What do you think we’re doing?</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: We’re getting into the mindset of last night,
to see if it sparks any memories. Now: is this exactly how you were
dancing for me last night, Starr?</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Yeah, still no memories. Keep going – and put
your back into it.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: You are so goddamn selfish, Vick. You really
are. Stu, let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: No. Stu, sit and enjoy your dance.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Dude: Doug is missing! We have less than 18
hours til his wedding! We do not have time for this!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: I’m trying to save your life here, Alan
Mervish.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Vick–!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: I’m not kidding, man! Life is one long series
of emergencies, and if you don’t learn to stop and have a little fun
along the way, you’re gonna grow into a joyless old prick like your dad.
I’m sorry to bring Moshe Mervish into it, but it had to be said. Now
yes, we have 18 hours to find Doug – which means we can afford to spend
ten minutes celebrating the special talents of these gifted young
body-artists. So sit down, have a jager shot, and smell the goddamn
roses for once in your miserable life. Chastity, honey? When you’re
ready?</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: No, look– I am like totally against this,
morally and politically. Plus Becky specifically asked me not to–</p>
<p><strong>alan sitting on the banquette, looking awestruck</strong>: as
Chastity works a wildly erotic lapdance on him. She crawls onto his lap,
she whips him with her long hair, she puts her tongue in his ear. Next
to him, no longer getting lapdances, Vick and Stu just sit, staring at
Chastity, entranced.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I think I know why he married her.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Because if he hadn’t, I would’ve.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Is it weird that we’re sitting this close
watching?</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Not for me.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I really shouldn’t be here. I have
daughters.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Not that can do that.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: How can she do that without dislocating her
hip?</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Because she’s been touched by God.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Alan, come on, man, we gotta go!</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Whoa, whoa, I’m smelling the roses–</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Come on, man! We got company!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Chastity, honey, is there a back way out of
here?!</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: Come on!</p>
<p><strong>together for…double staxxx!</strong>: All the patrons turn
their attention to Stage One – then Stu blows through the curtain, out
of breath. Beat. The patrons look at Stu, confused. Stu looks at them,
equally so. The patrons start to BOOO, just as Vick, Chastity, and Alan
blow through the curtain after Stu.</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: Come on!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Did she just do that in heels?!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: I’m really starting to like this girl.</p>
<p><strong>chastity and the guys race through the strip club</strong>:
Upsetting cocktails, hopping onto stages and then off again, leaping
over chairs, spinning around stripper poles, and, finally, sprinting out
the front door!</p>
<p><strong>they’re clotheslined by two chairs</strong>: being swung into
their chests! SMASH! They both stumble backwards, and then four
roided-up STRIP CLUB SECURITY GUARDS pounce on them, wrestling them to
the ground.</p>
<p><strong>crazy horse security guard</strong>: Viper One, this is
Rolling Thunder, we’ve subdued the targets, over.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Did you see them trample those tiny Japanese
businessmen?! I think they killed like four of them!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Come on, Alan: tell me that wasn’t just a
little fun…</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: That was…a little fun.</p>
<p><strong>las vegas policeman</strong>: Victor Lennon?! Alan Mervish?!
Stuart Pryce?!</p>
<p>****: Y-Yes?!</p>
<p><strong>las vegas policeman</strong>: You’re coming with us.</p>
<p><strong>officer merriweather</strong>: Where were you last night at
3am?</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: No idea.</p>
<p><strong>officer bladen</strong>: Okay, how about at 2am?</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Ditto.</p>
<p><strong>officer merriweather</strong>: You think this is cute, son?!
You think this is a game?!</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Whatever we did, we’re so sorry!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Honestly, man, I will confess to anything you
want!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Stu: stop talking. Alan: sit up straight.
Officer Merriweather, I’ve told you twelve times now: we have no memory
of last night. Now either charge us with a crime, or let us go.</p>
<p><strong>officer merriweather</strong>: What do you know about Jimmy
Lang?</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Nothing?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Who is he?</p>
<p><strong>officer merriweather</strong>: Jimmy Lang runs the infamous
Shiang- Xi crime organization, and is wanted in seven states for money
laundering, drug smuggling, racketeering and murder.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Oh my god–</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Did we kill someone last night–?!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: We have no idea who this man is.</p>
<p><strong>officer merriweather</strong>: Is that right?</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Yeah, that’s right.</p>
<p><strong>birthday tooo yoooou!</strong>: Everyone applauds. Vick
drunkenly hugs Jimmy Lang.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: I love you, Jimmy Lang!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: We’re in a lot of trouble, aren’t we.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Officers, I swear, we have no memory of that
ever occurring–</p>
<p><strong>officer bladen</strong>: Okay. Maybe a night in jail will
jostle something loose.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Oh no, sir, please don’t!</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: We have a very important wedding–!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: I know Jimmy Lang.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: You do?!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Jimmy and I tried to raise capital for
Girl-nasium, a 24 hour fitness center and day spa for tween-age girls,
but it never got off the ground. It was an entirely legitimate
enterprise – I had no idea he was a criminal. We must’ve bumped into him
last night, and he must’ve invited us to join his birthday celebration.
No crime in that, is there, Officers?</p>
<p><strong>officer merriweather</strong>: You actually expect me to
believe that dung?</p>
<p>****: Yes, Officer Merriweather. I do.</p>
<p><strong>officer merriweather</strong>: If I find out you’re lying to
me, son, I will take all of you down, is that clear?</p>
<p><strong>officer bladen</strong>: You boys wouldn’t last three hours
in prison.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Stu might.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Now: are you gonna charge us with something,
or are we free to go?</p>
<p><strong>officer bladen</strong>: Get outta here.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Oh, thank you, Officers!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: It was really nice meeting you–!</p>
<p><strong>officer merriweather</strong>: If you know what’s good for
you, you’ll get the hell out of Vegas.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Did you have to be such a dick?!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: We got out, didn’t we?</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Yeah, four hours later! If we’d just
cooperated with them–</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: If we’d cooperated with them, we’d be in jail
right now, Alan.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: What are we gonna do now? We’ve got zero leads
on where Doug is!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Why hasn’t he called? It’s 8:30.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Do you think he’s okay–?</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Stu, don’t. Doug is fine.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I mean, we were hanging out with mobsters last
night, man! They kill people for looking at `em weird–!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Stu: Doug is fine.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Or what if we like drove Doug out to the desert
and left him, just as like a funny prank–?!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Stu! Enough!</p>
<p>****: I knew I shouldn’t have come…</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: What did you just say?</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: I said I knew I shouldn’t have come this
weekend, Vick!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Is that right?</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Yeah, that’s right. I only came because Doug
insisted.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Why do think you’re so much better than us,
dude?!</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: I don’t – I just think I’m better than you,
Vick! And trust me, it’s not that hard! You haven’t changed one bit
since high school! Jesus, you’re 28 years old and you still talk back to
cops?! Really?!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: You’re out of your depth, Alan–</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: And you’re still the one getting us in
trouble! Only then it was hiding your weed in our locker, and now you’ve
got us partying with wanted felons! It’s not cute anymore, man! We’re
too old for this!</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: And all your stupid get-rich-quick schemes?!
Girl-nasium?! Custard?! In Los Angeles?! Are you joking?!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Okay, let’s all take a breath–</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: When’s the last time you had a real job, man?!
When’s the last time you had a girlfriend?! Hell, when’s the last time
you picked up the check?!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: What’s so great about any of those
things?!</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Those “things,” Vick, are what grown men
do!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Look, we’re all tired and hungry–</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: None of us ever liked you, Alan! We only hung
out with you because Doug made us!</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Stu…? Is that true?</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Why would anyone like you, dude? Have you ever
thought about that? You’re uptight, you’re judgemental, you’re cheap,
and yet somehow you think you’re sweeter than everyone else! Well look
around, man: no one wants to be you! I’d rather be Stu than you!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Wait, what–?</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: I’ve…always…hated you…</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: You punch like…your sister…</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Hey, no! Time out! We all need a time out–!</p>
<p><strong>a car horn sounds</strong>: And all three of them look up to
see Vick’S BEAT-UP CADILLAC parked on the curb, Chastity at the
wheel.</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: That might not be like, the smartest place
to fight?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Good call on happy hour, Chastity. These tacos
kick ass.</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: Yeah, I always come here when I get out of
jail.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Hey – how’d you start Vick’s car?</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: Oh, my daddy taught me how to hotwire
almost anything.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: That’s funny, because Alan’s daddy taught him
tax law.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: And Vick’s daddy taught him how to get really
drunk at his kid’s soccer games and then piss himself.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: It’s a disease, dude–!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Guys, come on! For Doug?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: “Number blocked.”</p>
<p><strong>vince alan</strong>: Don’t answer it. Answer it.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: What if it’s Doug?</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: What if it’s Tracy?!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Good evening, this is Stu!</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Stu, it’s Tracy!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: It’s Tracy!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Why is she calling me?!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Because she knows you’re the most easily
tricked.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: We have tell her we lost Doug.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: No we don’t! Tell her nothing, Stu!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Hey, Trace! W-What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Oh, nothing, just here with my family…</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Wow, that sounds amazing!</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Yeah…? Hey, you wouldn’t happen to know where
Doug is, would you? He said he’d be home by 5 for this dinner, and now
it’s almost 9:00. I tried his cell, but he didn’t answer…</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Ummmm……..Hang on. She wants to know where Doug
is!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: I’m working on it! Buy us some time!</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: No, just tell her the truth! Honesty is always
the best policy!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: What are you, retarded?! Honesty is never the
best policy! Especially not with brides!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Um, what’d you say?</p>
<p>****: I asked if you knew where Doug was.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Yeah, um, hang on. She still wants to know!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Okay: tell her Alan got really drunk last
night and fell down, and the doctor said not to move him for a few
hours, but that we’ll be back in time for the wedding.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Why do I have to be the one that fell over
drunk?!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: It’s a fictitious canard, Alan, get over
yourself! Stu: tell her!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Listen, Tracy, Alan fell on a</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Fell over drunk.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: H-He was drunk. And the doctor – a different
doctor, not the one he fell on – he said we couldn’t move him until the
wedding–</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: For a few hours! We’ll be home before the
wedding!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: But we’re going to have the wedding at your
home–</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Tracy?! Vick! How are ya, hon?</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Vick, what is going on?</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Nothing! Stu is a moron. Listen, Alan hurt his
back last night, so we’re gonna be laid up here for a bit, but I promise
we’ll have Doug home in time for the wedding, okay?</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Oh God, is Alan all right?</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Yes, luckily he had a steel rod surgically
implanted up his ass at birth, so the doctors anticipate a complete and
swift recovery.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Can I talk to Doug?</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: What? No! No, you can’t actually, Doug…Doug is
out.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Where is he? He’s aaaat…the pharmacy. Yeah,
picking up Alan’s medications. Listen, Trace, I’m losing you, but we’ll
see you tomorrow, okay? Bye, sweetie–!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: She bought it.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: They’ve done something stupid.</p>
<p><strong>mr. turner</strong>: No surprise there.</p>
<p><strong>mr. turner</strong>: I’m just saying, what kind of man stands
up his fianc�e the night before their wedding?</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Dad, I don’t want to hear it. I trust Doug
absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Perfect. We just told Tracy we’d have Doug
home in 13 hours, and we still have no idea where he is…</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: Handstamp for re-entry? Handstamp for
re-entry?</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Maybe we should go back to the hotel and–</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Oh my God, guys! Look!</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: It’s like a map of last night!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Where do you want to start?!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: At the top! We hit every club we went to til
someone remembers what we did with Doug!</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Nice clue, Stuey! I can’t believe we’re
actually gonna pull this off!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Hey: is that guy wearing Doug’s hat?!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Naaah, couldn’t be.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Lots of people have hats like that.</p>
<p><strong>tight on: stu’s hand</strong>: The first bar written on it is
“GhostBar.”</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: All right, this is the last place we went,
“Chaps.”</p>
<p><strong>chaps nightclub</strong>: It takes a moment for the guys to
realize that everyone in line is male, buff, and wearing erotic cowboy
gear.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: You sure we came here…?</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: The Golden Pony. That’s us.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Maybe I’ll just wait in the car–</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: You think we would’ve remembered this…</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Yeah, I don’t think we came here…</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Then why is your underwear nailed to the
wall?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Those could be anybody’s. Thousands of people
go to Colorado State–</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Oh my God, are they autographed?</p>
<p>****: “Stu Pryce, 9/30/08. I Chaps!”</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I am so gay…</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Hey, guys! Roger is backstage!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: R-Roger?</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Stay very close to me.</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: How are Haylee and Kaitlin?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Oh. G-Good, thanks…?</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: We’re going to love you either way, Stu…</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Some of my best friends are gay.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Is that true?</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Not…not really? I live in Connecticut, man, we
don’t even have black people yet.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Excuse me, friend, can you tell me where Roger
is?</p>
<p><strong>beefcake cowboy</strong>: Oh, hey, Vick! Roger’s over
there.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: He’s cute…I guess…?</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: Oh! Hey guys!</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: I’m surprised you’re even walking yet,
Stu.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Oh my god.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Listen, man, we don’t really remember what
happened last night, can you fill us in?</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: Really? No memory?</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: Well, I must say, Stu, I’m a little hurt.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Did we…you know…do anything?</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: Well, duh? Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Was I…the boy or the girl?</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: Oh, honey, you were everything.</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: But you were nothing like Vick.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Wait– what?!</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: I know, I’m sort of over group stuff too, but
Alan insisted.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: You insisted?! Why’d you insist?!</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: I don’t know! I don’t know why I insisted!</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: Actually, after the anger went away, it was
really quite tender.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I’m really not sure we can be friends
anymore…</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: Guys: he’s kidding.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Not cool, Roger. Not cool.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: So what did happen last night?</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: Oh, well, you guys came in near the end of
our last set, like 2ish. Doug pretty much dragged you in.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Really? Doug did?</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: Oh no, my Doug, not your Doug. Black guy,
shaved head?</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: He’s a cake designer, he said he met you guys
at some sort of birthday party at the Rio?</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: The guy from the Jimmy Lang surveillance
video.</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: Anyway, for the big finale of our show, we
always bring someone on stage, and, well, Stu, you volunteered pretty
aggressively. Hey Dallas, do we have the video of last night’s show?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: No! That’s cool, I don’t need to see it–</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: We must see that video.</p>
<p><strong>dallas</strong>: It’s in the machine.</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: You were pretty mellow at first, Stu, but
once we got you into the chaps, you really came alive– oh, here it
is.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I’m a Dad, I-I don’t get to the gym as much as
I’d like…</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: You even taught us The Pony, which we’d never
even heard of before…</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: And then, of course, the pi�ce de resistance:
the Ride of the Valkyries.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Annnnd that would explain the searing ass
pain.</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: After the show, we split a couple pitchers of
flirtinis, you had our stylist cut your hair like mine, and then you
split.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: And what time was all this?</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: 4:30 in the morning? 4:45?</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: And our Doug was with us?</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: Yeah, he had passed out by then, but you
carried him out. It was all very Officer And A Gentleman.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Wait, so we left with Doug at 4:45, we got
back to the hotel at 5:00, and Doug was gone by 5:30 when Chastity met
back up with us?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: That doesn’t make any sense.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Did we lose him along the way?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: He was passed out, how far could he have
gone–?</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>atashir</strong>: Mr. Lennon?</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Atashir, many greetings to you.</p>
<p><strong>atashir</strong>: I thought you might like to know that one
of our maids just found your friend, Douglas, passed out in your
room.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: What?! Are you sure it’s him?!</p>
<p><strong>atashir</strong>: I saw him with my own eyes. He is
unconscious but breathing nicely.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Oh thank you, Atashir! You are a man of great
honor! A thousand blessings upon your ancestors!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Doug is in the room! A maid just found him!
He’s passed out, but he’s okay!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: They’re sure it’s him?!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Atashir swears it is!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Oh thank God he’s okay…</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: After all this?! He’s in the room?!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: I don’t even care! Hug me, you big shiny
homosexual!</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: That was cool of Roger to give you all the
tapes of your performance.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I know, if I actually was gay, I’d totally date
Roger first. What a gentle soul.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: How we doing on time?</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: We’ll be in LA by dawn. I told you bitches
this would all work out…</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: This has officially been the craziest weekend
of my life. Thanks for all your help. You were awesome.</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: Anything for my hubby.</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: I’m kidding, Alan. I know last night
wasn’t, you know, real…</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: I’m sorry about all this, Chastity.</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: Jennifer.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Beg pardon?</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: My name is Jennifer. Jennifer Elly.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Okay, well, I’m sorry, Jennifer.</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: Oh, don’t be. Last night wasn’t the first
flaky decision I’ve ever made in my life. I mean, I am a stripper.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Where you from?</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: LA. Tarzana.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Oh yeah?</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: Yeah. I work here on the weekends.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: You fly out every week?</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: Yeah. I’d move, but my kid is in a great
school.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Kid?</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: They always have kids.</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: I have a little girl, Sarah. She’s… Well,
she’s everything.</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: What about you?</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: No kids. Same girlfriend for 14 years.
Becky.</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: Wow, she’s stunning.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: We like you way better.</p>
<p><strong>stu!</strong>: Chastity tries to stymie her laugh.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Becky is great.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Becky collects teapots.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Yeah, she’s a total canwego.</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: A what?</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: You know, she’s the girl at the party who’s
always like “Can we go? Can we go?”</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: She has low blood sugar.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: She has low fun sugar.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Jesus, guys! This is the girl I’m going to
marry! If, you know…she forgives me for cheating on her…</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Wait: you’re going to tell her?</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Of course I’m going to tell her! I could never
keep something like that from her.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Dude, she still hasn’t forgiven me for
scratching her Queensryche CD in sixth grade – she’s neeeeever gonna
forgive you for marrying a stripper in Vegas.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Well, then that’s just the price I’m going to
have to pay.</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: Good for you.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: She’s gonna cut your dick off, dude.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Keep `er close, Paco. We’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Doug! Wake up, man!</p>
<p><strong>kalolo fanalua</strong>: Aloha, assholes.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Uh-oh.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Not good.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy lang</strong>: Oh, hello. Good to see you again.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Where is Doug?</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Listen, Mr. Lang, whatever we did last night,
we are incredibly sorry-</p>
<p><strong>jimmy lang</strong>: These your rich friends you were telling
me about, Vick?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy lang</strong>: Oh, you haven’t told them yet? Really,
that’s low. Even for you.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: What’s going on, Vick?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy lang</strong>: Six months ago, your friend Vick
borrowed some money from me at what can only be described as a very
unfavorable interest rate. When the loan came due, he failed to pay me
back, but he promised me that he could get the money from you guys this
weekend.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Jesus, Vick…</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: How could you do this to us, man? We’re your
best friends…</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: They were gonna hurt me, man…</p>
<p><strong>jimmy lang</strong>: Well, Vick, it looks like you and your
friends have some issues to discuss. In the meantime…</p>
<p><strong>jimmy lang</strong>: I need my goddamn money.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: I can get it! I can! I just–</p>
<p><strong>jimmy lang</strong>: I’ve heard that before, Vick, including
last night, when you so rudely skipped out on my birthday party. That’s
why I’ve taken some collateral to ensure your payment. His name is
Doug.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: You have Doug?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Oh my God…</p>
<p><strong>jimmy lang</strong>: If you want your friend to live, meet me
at mile marker 26 off Highway 12 at dawn, and bring the money. Are we
clear?</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Yes! Yes.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: M-M-Mr. Lang?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy lang</strong>: Yes, Mr. Mervish?</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: H-How much does Vick owe?</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: 200 thousand dollars?!</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: How the hell could you blow that kind of
money?!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Was it for the custard store?</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Jesus, Stu, wake up! There is no custard
store! Vick was just trying to rip us off to pay back Jimmy Lang!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Is that true, Vick?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Were any of your deals…real?</p>
<p>****: Some.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Dude, I manage an Applebee’s, that money meant
something to me…</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Do you really think I wanted my life to turn
out like this, Stu?! Do you really think I don’t know that I’m a massive
loser?!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Jesus, you guys got out of high school and you
just knew what to do, you went to college and got good jobs and found
cool wives and made beautiful children – what do I have to show for the
last decade of my life?! Nothing!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Jesus, I’m almost 30, and the only thing I
really have…the only thing I really have is you guys.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Come on, Vick–</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: No, man, it’s true! I put on a good show, but
my life is so goddamn hollow and vapid and lonely, it scares me, man.
I-I don’t know how much longer I can keep this scam going. And now I’ve
gone and ruined the one good thing I had…</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Just…please don’t give up on me, okay? I-I
don’t know what I’d do without you guys. I really don’t…</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Come on, man, we’ve been bro’s since third
grade, it’s gonna take a lot more than money to ruin our friendship.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: What I don’t understand is why you didn’t just
ask me for the money. I would’ve given you every last cent I had,
man…</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I love you, man.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Love you too, bro. Love you too.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Also, I banged your sister sophomore year.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Sorry. Just seemed like a good time to tell
you.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: She had just broken up with that guy from
Central, we were playing “I Never” at Tim Donahee’s pool, one thing lead
to another–</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: No! No. That’s…that’s plenty.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Look, I’m glad we’re all sharing, but we’ve
got three hours to come up with 200 grand, or else…</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: I’d offer to take a loan out, but it’s 3
o’clock in the morning, I’m pretty sure my bank is closed.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I think I can get a 20 grand cash advance on my
credit card…</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: So that just leaves 180 grand…</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: Well, it is Vegas…</p>

The guys erupt in CHEERS around him, YAAA! The dealer slides over a
large pile of CHIPS.</p>
<p><strong>chastity throwing craps at a craps table</strong>: Again the
guys erupt! Alan hugs Chastity. Their pile of CHIPS grows…</p>
<p><strong>stu yelling “bingo” at a bingo table</strong>: The guys jump
up, slapping ten, YELLING! Stu points at a table full of OLD LADIES
nearby: in your face!</p>
<p><strong>alan, stu, vick and chastity sitting at a pai gow
table</strong>: looking lost. Then they take their large stack of chips
and quietly leave. No one knows how to play Pai Gow poker.</p>
<p><strong>vick jumping up from a war table</strong>: having just won!
Chastity and the guys aggressively hug him. Stu drinks from his glass,
hands shaking, wired.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Time check!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: 12 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Chip check!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Faster! Come on chip check!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Dude, how many Red Bulls have you had?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I stopped counting at six! I can hear my heart
beating in my head!</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Just over 100 grand.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: There’s only one thing left to do.</p>
<p><strong>$100,000 worth of chips being placed on black</strong>: at a
roulette table. The guys sweat, tense. Stu is insane.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: You sure we don’t want red?! What if the ball
lands on red–!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Shut up, Stu.</p>
<p><strong>roulette croupier</strong>: Betting is closed.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I can’t watch! My heart’s gonna explode! Can
your heart even explode?! Because I think my heart is gonna explode! I
can’t watch!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: It’s red, isn’t it?! I knew it! Tell me it’s
not red!</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: It’s not red…</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: It’s green.</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: Would you like me to come with?</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: No…It might get a little dangerous. I wouldn’t
want…</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: I’m so sorry…about everything.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Thanks for all your help.</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: There’s no sense…in exchanging numbers or
anything…right?</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Yeah, probably not…</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: Well…I’ll always remember you as a great
first husband, then.</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: You can just send the divorce papers to
the Crazy Horse or whatever…</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: Thanks for reminding me that there are
still some really good guys out there, Alan. I don’t…I don’t get to meet
too many of them.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: We gotta go, man.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Yep, just driving out to the middle of desert
to meet some mobsters, what could possibly go wrong…?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: So what’s our plan?</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: I think we should tell Mr. Lang that we
couldn’t get the money, but that, if he’s amenable, we could create a
payment calendar–</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: We’re gonna give Jimmy a dummy bag of money,
grab Doug, and make a run for it.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Yes, good! What an airtight plan–!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Jimmy Lang doesn’t do payment calendars, Alan!
Trust me: this is our only shot of getting Doug back! Left turn!</p>
<p><strong>the first rays of dawn</strong>: streaking across Venice
Beach.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Any word from Doug?</p>
<p><strong>mr. turner</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p>****: I know you don’t want to hear it, Trace, but you deserve
better.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: I’m sure everything’s fine. They’re all
smart, capable adults…</p>
<p><strong>vick delicately laying cash inside his duffel bag</strong>:
on top of his dirty clothing, fruitlessly trying to create the
appearance of a bag full of money. He’s using some $20 bills, but also
some $5’s and $1’s.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: This all the cash we got?</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: This is the dumbest plan ever.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Alan I need you positive please.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Here they come.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Stuart?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: There’s an emergency bottle of tequila in my
glove box. Get it out please.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: I can’t believe this is how we’re going to
die…</p>
<p><strong>jimmy lang</strong>: Let’s see the money!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Let’s see Doug!</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Jesus, what’d they do to him?</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Pull off the Ralph’s bag!</p>
<p><strong>it’s not doug</strong>: It’s some black dude. Vick, Stu, and
Alan look confused.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Who the hell is that?!</p>
<p>****: This is Doug!</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Oh my God: it’s the other Doug! Roger’s
friend, the cake designer!</p>
<p><strong>black doug</strong>: I told you, man, I’m Doug Howland! I
barely even know these guys!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Yeah, you got the wrong Doug, man!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy lang</strong>: You sure?!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Yeah, man, our Doug is white!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy lang</strong>: But you were partying with this guy at
my birthday thing!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: I don’t know what to tell you, bro, this isn’t
the Doug we requested!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy lang</strong>: Well. I apologize for the mix-up… But
I’m still gonna need my money.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Oh my God Oh my God Oh my God…</p>
<p><strong>jimmy lang</strong>: Don’t move, Vick.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy lang</strong>: Now please. Give me my money.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy lang</strong>: Don’t be stupid, son. You–</p>
<p><strong>nothing happens</strong>: Jimmy is built like a tank. Vick
freezes, oh shit. Then Jimmy PISTOL-WHIPS Vick – his lip explodes with
blood and he falls to the ground.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Christ that hurts!</p>
<p><strong>aaaaaaahhhhhhh!</strong>: Jimmy looks up to see Stu insanely
charging him like the linebacker he once was! Jimmy raises his gun,
but</p>
<p><strong>stu tackles jimmy to the ground first!</strong>: The gun
flies free and they wrestle for it! Dust flies!</p>
<p><strong>back by the yukon</strong>: The two Guamians fumble for their
guns – but it’s difficult with huge CASTS on their shooting hands!</p>
<p><strong>on black doug</strong>: He sees what’s going down, and, his
hands tied behind his back, takes off sprinting towards Vegas!</p>
<p><strong>by the caddilac</strong>: Alan looks around, what should I
do?! What should I do?! Then he spots the keys in the ignition of the
car. He hops in and fires up the engine! Just then</p>
<p><strong>the two guamians open fire</strong>: Bullets pound into the
Cadillac! Alan ducks down, terrified, and floors the gas!</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: I’m being shot at! I’m being shot at!</p>
<p><strong>up ahead</strong>: Jimmy Lang throws Stu off of him and
recovers his gun, panting. He cocks it, aims it at Stu on the
ground.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy lang</strong>: I really didn’t want to kill anyone</p>
<p><strong>today–</strong>: Then WHAM! Alan drives the car into Jimmy
Lang at 25mph! The obese mobster is pitched off his feet, and lands a
good ten yards away, in a heap of dust! The guys freeze, shocked.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Oh my god, is he okay?!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Who cares! Go go!</p>
<p><strong>bullets impact all all over car</strong>: taking out the
tail-lights, the windshield, the headrests. The guys duck down til
they’re sufficiently far away. Then they sit up, amazed, out of
breath.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I can’t believe you just saved my life!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: I can’t believe you just drove my car into
Jimmy Lang!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: He’s gonna be really upset!</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Yeah, I was just thinking that!</p>
<p><strong>back on jimmy lang</strong>: The huge mobster lies face-down
on the desert floor. His two henchmen waddle up, highly concerned.</p>
<p><strong>kikiolani</strong>: Boss, Boss, you okay?!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy lang</strong>: Find Vick… And kill him.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Now can we call Tracy?</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Yeah. It’s probably time.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Who wants to make the call?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: That was you!</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: What?! No! I beat you by a mile!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Vick, who won?!</p>
<p>****: Actually…I should do it. This weekend was mostly my fault. I
need to Man Up.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Well, I’ll be damned…</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: I still can’t believe Stu banged my
sister.</p>
<p><strong>mr. turner</strong>: Any word from Doug?</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: No, but I’m sure he’s–</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: In the desert, on the pay phone, looking
through his busted aviators into the rising sun.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Tracy, it’s Vick.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Hey Vick!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Listen, honey…The bachelor party got a little
out of control and, well…we lost Doug.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: What?! But we’re getting married in like four
hours!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Yeah, that’s not gonna happen…</p>
<p><strong>back in the car</strong>: Alan starts to take a pull of
Patron – when he freezes, realizing something!</p>
<p><strong>back to vick</strong>: on the phone with Tracy, being
genuinely contrite.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Look, I’m really sorry, Trace. This is all my
fault–</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: What the–?!</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Tracy, it’s Alan! Hey, Vick is just joking
around! We’ve got Doug right here!</p>
<p>****: What kind of joke is that?!</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: I know, Vick is such a prick! We’ll see you at
the wedding! Bye!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: I know where Doug is!</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Remember when we saw Doug’s bed impaled on the
griffin thing?!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Yeah, we threw it out the window.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: No: the windows don’t open, remember?!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: So how did–?</p>
<p>****: Oh my God.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I don’t get it.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: And that’s why we’ve been seeing Doug’s
clothes all over Vegas! He was trying to signal someone!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: I don’t believe it…</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I-I still don’t get it–</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: And it totally jives with the timeline,
right?! We brought Doug back to the hotel at 5:00, he was passed
out…</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: It’s so obvious!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Not…to me…so much?</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: How’d you figure it out?!</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: The Patron, man! It reminded me of our first
drink of the night!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Honestly, dude, you’re a genius.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: He’s on the roof!</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: After Doug passed out, we must’ve taken him up
there in his bed as a prank, so he’d wake up on the roof or whatever?
Then we forgot him.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: And all day he’s been throwing his crap off
the roof, trying to signal someone to get him down!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: You think he’s still up there?!</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Only one way to find out…</p>
<p><strong>where are you, man?!</strong>: But Doug is nowhere to be
seen. The guys start to despair… Then…stepping out from behind an
air-conditioning vent, naked except for tighty-whities, his entire body
bright pink from sunburn…</p>
<p><strong>is doug!</strong>: And he looks furious. The guys run to him,
overjoyed!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Oh my god, I’m so glad you’re okay!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Don’t…even…talk to me.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Okay, no, that’s cool!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Yeah, you have every right to be upset! We
validate your anger!</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Why’d you do it, sweet Atashir?! Why did you
betray us?!</p>
<p><strong>atashir</strong>: Because they paid me. And also because
you’re kind of racist.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Fair enough! See you next time, you beautiful
Judas!</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: No flights to LA with empty seats!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Well, we can’t drive! It’s 350 miles to LA and
the wedding starts at 10, which is in–</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: –three hours!</p>
<p><strong>the totalled cadillac rocketing down i-15</strong>: Vick is
at the wheel, leaning on the HORN, keeping the three- doored Caddy at
110 miles per hour. When traffic gets thick, he doesn’t hesitate to
drive in the shoulder. In the backseat, Doug chugs bottled water, still
simmering.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Look, Doug, I think I speak for everyone in
the car when I say I’m really sorry about locking you on the roof of the
hotel.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: You gotta admit, it’s a pretty funny prank… I
mean, up until the part when we forgot all about you.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: He’s still not talking to us.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Totally understandable, man. Whenever you’re
ready…</p>
<p><strong>i owe you, neeco!</strong>: The driver gives Vick a thumbs
up, and heads off. Alan rips open the package – inside are four TUXEDOS.
The guys start taking off their tattered clothes…</p>
<p><strong>mr. turner</strong>: I’m sorry, honey, but I think you need
to seriously consider that Doug might not be coming…</p>
<p><strong>mr. turner</strong>: Some men just aren’t cut out for this
kind of commitment. I’m so sorry that this is how you had to find
out–</p>
<p><strong>vick, alan, stu, and doug</strong>: stride inside! Their
tuxes are wrinkled, their hair is a mess, and the groom is bright pink –
but they’re here.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Sorry, Mapquest took us a crazy route. We
ready to do this thing?</p>
<p><strong>tracy and her father</strong>: walking down the aisle,
arm-in-arm, as Mozart plays. Tracy looks tentative. Her father frowns,
not at all happy…</p>
<p><strong>in the audience</strong>: Everyone smiles, AHHS, and snaps
photos…</p>
<p><strong>at the altar</strong>: The groomsmen smile as well. Vick
whispers to Doug:</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: She looks beautiful, man.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: That’s cool. I get it.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: reaches the altar, then turns to her dad. His
face is a mess of emotions. They hug.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: I love you, Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>mr. turner</strong>: I love you too, pumpkin.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Where were you? And why are you pink?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: It’s a long story. All I can say is I’m so
sorry. And I promise, for as long as we’re married, I will never ever
put you through something like this again. Can… Can you forgive me?</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: We, um, we traditionally wait til the end
for the kiss…?</p>
<p><strong>doug and tracy still kissing</strong>: at the reception. The
entire wedding party is applauding.</p>
<p><strong>champagne is uncorked</strong>: and the WEDDING BAND kicks
in. We are now down on the lawn, where white tables and a dance floor
have been set up.</p>
<p><strong>standing in the back of the reception</strong>: Vick, Stu,
and Alan aggressively APPLAUD and WHISTLE for the bride and the
groom.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: We did it, fellahs. We pulled it off.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: I never had a doubt.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: You think Doug’s ever going to talk to us
again?</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Give him time.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Yeah. Like a decade or two–</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Uh-oh.</p>
<p><strong>becky</strong>: Alan’s girlfriend of 14 years, bearing down
on them, irate.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Hey Beck–!</p>
<p><strong>becky</strong>: Shut up, Vick! Alan, where the hell have you
been?! I’ve been calling and calling! What, you don’t answer your phone
anymore?!</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: I-I’m so sorry, I can explain–</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Alan?</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: standing behind them in a very sexy, very
elegant dress, her hair back. She cleans up nicely. Alan swallows,
whoa.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: This just got complicated…</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Jennifer?</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: I-I know I wasn’t invited, but I just had
to return this…</p>
<p><strong>becky</strong>: Okay: who the hell is this chick, and why the
hell does she have your Grandmother’s wedding ring?!</p>
<p><strong>becky</strong>: Talk, you moron! Jesus, you’re just like your
mother! Talk! Who’s the ho wearing my ring?!</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: She’s my wife.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: We don’t make each other happy anymore, Beck.
And we can keep not making each other happy for another 14 years – hell,
maybe even another 50 years – but let’s not. Let’s find people who make
our hearts race. Let’s be excited and fun and alive again…</p>
<p><strong>becky</strong>: Are you fucking kidding me?</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: I’m sorry, Beck. I really am. Can I buy you a
free drink?</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: We’re not…actually…still married, are
we?</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Let’s start with dinner, and see where it
goes…?</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: I’d like that.</p>
<p><strong>back on becky</strong>: She finally recovers enough to
speak:</p>
<p><strong>becky</strong>: Alan! Alan Steven Mervish, get back here this
second! Don’t you walk away from me, you stupid little clown! I own you!
GET</p>
<p><strong>back here immediately!</strong>: But Alan just keeps walking
away with Chastity. Vick and Stu wave him on, go dude! Go! Then Becky
turns on them. Beat. They both scatter, terrified.</p>
<p><strong>stay with stu</strong>: as he hurries off through the crowd.
After a moment, he</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Daddy?!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Oh, I missed you guys so much!</p>
<p><strong>haylee</strong>: We missed you too, daddy!</p>
<p><strong>kaitlin</strong>: You’re the best dad ever!</p>
<p><strong>erin</strong>: Jesus, are you still drunk?</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Okay, okay, I’ll go with you. Just…don’t ruin
the wedding.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy lang</strong>: I really didn’t want it to end like
this, Vick.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy lang</strong>: Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Um, what…?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy lang</strong>: Your friend Alan just paid your marker.
Took out a second mortgage on his house. The full 200 grand, plus
medical expenses, which I thought was a classy touch.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy lang</strong>: Without our friends, we are nothing,
Vick. Remember that.</p>
<p><strong>vick, stu, and alan</strong>: standing on the cliffs
overlooking the Pacific, drinks in hand, as the wedding reception rages
on behind them.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: I will pay you back, you know.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Damn straight you will!</p>
<p><strong>voice behind them</strong>: Okay, so what the hell happened
this weekend?</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: Well, Alan married a stripper, Stu went gay,
and I learned a very important life lesson from an obese hoodlum.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: We’ll tell you the whole story when you get
back from your honeymoon.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: We really are sorry, man.</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong>: To Doug and Tracy.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: To Doug and Tracy.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: To Doug and Tracy.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: To me and Tracy – and to being here, with my
three former best friends in the world…</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: There’s nowhere else I’d rather be right
now.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: That said, let’s not get too stupid tonight,
okay? I’m going on my honeymoon in 24 hours…</p>
<p><strong>the guys</strong>: No, no. / We’ll be good. / Totally,
dude.</p>
