<p><strong>roll prologue over main title</strong>: a collage of old
photos, prints, etc., and silent live-action vignettes, all dark and
heavily shadowed like a dimly-remembered dream. The first images show
the opulence of the Gilded Age, the epic vistas of the west, cattle
drives and cowtowns with all their violence….</p>
<p><strong>v.o. narration</strong>: “The economic explosion following
the Civil War created an unprecedented nation-wide market for beef.
Previously worthless cattle running wild throughout Texas were gathered
into herds And driven north to the railheads In Kansas. Fortunes were
made as Cowtowns sprang up on the Prairies, wide-open centers of
Commerce and vice, their streets Choked with heavily-armed young Men
fresh from the cattle drives. In those days the correct term For a
cowhand was ‘drover’. ‘Cowboy’, like ‘cowpoke’, was originally an insult
implying deviant sexuality and was rarely used. But these invading
drovers were a wild breed for soon shootings and wholesale drunken riots
became so frequent that ordinary citizens literally could not walk down
the street. In fact at their height the cowtowns had higher murder rates
than modern New York or Los Angeles and there Was no law but that of the
gun.”</p>
<p><strong>v.o. narration</strong>: “Straight-up at 75 yards or eye-
to-eye at point-blank range, the greatest gunman of all time was an
Illinois abolitionist farm boy named James Butler Hickok, better known
as Wild Bill, the Prince of Pistoleers. But Wild Bill worked His trade
on the side of justice And as marshal of cowtowns like Hays City and
Abilene he became a Legend, the one man who stood Between law and
chaos.”</p>
<p><strong>v.o. narration</strong>: “Wild Bill’s fame spread nation-
wide but his end came quietly in the spring of ’76 when a strange
cross-eyed little drifter put a bullet through the back of his head,
apparently for no other reason than he wanted to kill a celebrity.”</p>
<p><strong>v.o. narration</strong>: “In Dodge City meanwhile, Wyatt Earp
and Bat Masterson were Becoming known as fast-guns. But Their fame had
nothing to do with Shooting.”</p>
<p><strong>v.o. narration</strong>: “Earp and Masterson operated more
like modern policemen, using teamwork and persuasion to keep order.
Still, sometimes things got out of hand.”</p>
<p><strong>v.o. narration</strong>: “But Wyatt had a guardian
angel.”</p>
<p><strong>v.o. narration</strong>: “John Henry ‘Doc’ Holliday was the
son of an aristocratic, highly cultured southern family. Trained in
Philadelphia, he had Embarked on a career as a society Dentist when he
contracted Tuberculosis. Advised to practice In the west where it was
thought The climate and clean air would Prolong his life, Doc soon
Realized it was all only a matter Of time and gave up dentistry to
Become a professional gambler and Gunman…”</p>
<p><strong>v.o. narration</strong>: “Others headed east. Bent on
becoming an actress. Josephine Marcus defied her wealthy and Very proper
San Francisco Jewish Family to run away with a Traveling theatrical
company, Braving the perils of the Frontier on her own. Dangerous as
This might seem, it was another Age and women were so rare, their
Presence so cherished that they Could travel virtually anywhere In the
west in perfect safety.”</p>
<p><strong>v.o. narration</strong>: “At about this time the Texas
Rangers, having eliminated the Commanche threat, turned their Attention
to the outlaw gangs Marauding along the Rio Grande, Cleaning up the
border strip in 4 Years of hard riding. Those they Could not indict or
convict the Rangers put down in their Black Book, letting it be known
that They could either leave Texas or Face summary execution. This
Resulted in the mass migration of The absolute dregs of the Texas
Underworld to the most dangerous, Uncivilized part of the entire
Country, the southeast corner of The Arizona Territory.”</p>
<p><strong>v.o. narration</strong>: “Harsh and inhospitable, savaged in
turn by the Apache and Mexican bandits, this had always been an accursed
place, a virtual hell on earth where it was thought life itself could
never prosper, much less civilization. Then in 1879, a prospector named
Ed Schiefflin set off alone into the Dragoon Mountains. Friends told him
he Was crazy, that the only thing He’d find in this Godforsaken Place
would be his tombstone. Instead he found silver, lots of It, and
overnight the town of Tombstone sprang up. Mining Taking out millions in
ore. Land Value shot sky-high and Speculators and gamblers and
Opportunists of all nations Scrambled in by the thousands to Make
Tombstone queen of the Boomtowns, so rich that the Latest Paris
fashions, hard to Find even in the biggest cities, Were sold there by
the wagonload From the makeshift storefronts.”</p>
<p><strong>v.o. narration</strong>: “Meanwhile, the exile Texans had
banded together to form the nucleaus of an organized gang. Seizing
controp of the Surrounding countryside they Robbed stagecoaches at will
while The big absentee business Interests employed them as tax
Collectors and strongarm men. But The backbone of their trade Remained
border rustling, Periodic raids into Mexico to Steal cattle while
engaging in What was described as a virtual Orgy of murder and violence.
The Raids became so frequent and so Bloody that the Mexican Government
formally protested to U.S. President Chester A. Arthur, Prompting heated
debate in Congress. General Sherman Declared that the only possible Way
of bringing order was to send In the army but in the wake of Civil War
Reconstruction federal Intervention in civilian affairs Was politically
impossible.”</p>
<p><strong>v.o. narration</strong>: “With only some 100 members, the
gang was an elite body of gunmen, known by the red silk sashes they wore
around their waists. Fiercely proud of their Terrifying reputation and
Answerable to no one, they were a Law unto themselves, finally Emerging
as one of the earliest Examples in American history of Full-scale
organized crime.”</p>
<p><strong>v.o. narration</strong>: “They called themselves the
Cowboys.”</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: It’s them, only an hour north.</p>
<p><strong>young rurale</strong>: But this is the border.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: You saw what those animals did at That

my fault, Just doin’ my job. I don’t even Know if it was my bullet that
Dropped him, but… I don’t kno, It’s sort of hard to explain. At First I

sunk in what I’d Done… Believe me, boy, you Don’t ever want to feel that
way. Not ever. Didn’t even make a dent, did I? You’re both makin’ a big
mistake.</p>

<p><strong>wagonmaster</strong>: Rest of us’re 3 months out of
Independece but we’re from Carthage, Illinois originally.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Carthage, really? I’m from Monmouth.</p>
<p><strong>wagonmaster</strong>: Another Illinois man! Practical
Neighbors! Step down, Marshal. Have a feed.</p>
<p><strong>wagonmaster</strong>: Ain’t got law, ain’t got nothin’. Only
thing between us and the Animals. Always the way it goes, Though. Only
way to down an Illinois man’s from behind, the Dogs don’t dare face ’em.
Mr. Lincoln, Wild Bill, now your Brothers: Illinois men all and All
downed from behind by dirty Dogs and Democrats. Guess an Ordinary man’d
be out for Vengeance but I don’t figure That’ll answer here. It’s a
Reckoning you’re after.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: If the Lord is my friend.</p>
<p><strong>wagonmaster</strong>: Let not your heart be faint, let Your
arm be steel-that’s all you Need of the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Know why you’re here?</p>
<p><strong>vermillion</strong>: Way ahead of you, Wyatt. You want Us to
help you get Ike Clanton And Johnny Behan. Everybody knows They’re the
ones to blame for Your brothers.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: They’re nothing. They’re nobody. I want the
Cowboys. All of ’em. I Mean to break ’em up, drive ’em Out of the
territory.</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: Are you out of your mind? What on Earth’d
make us-</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: I’ll pay you 500 each in advance And I’ll
mount you on those.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Got a sheaf of federal warrants. Being in the
Territories it’s up To our discretion how they’re Served. That means we
got the Cowboys without quarter. The Black flag, brother. No Prisoners,
no mercy, amen.</p>
<p><strong>vermillion</strong>: 500… Year’s wages. And I never even saw
a horse like that.</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: You crazy? It can’t be done.</p>
<p><strong>mcmasters</strong>: It might be done. If we hit the
Waterholes through the southern Dragoons, the Whetstones and Huachucas,
we could take ’em on In pieces, run off their herds. Keep your money,
I’ll show you Where those waterholes are. Just Promise me you’ll finish
it. No Matter what happens you’ll see it Through to the end. I’ll have
Your hand on that.</p>
<p><strong>vermillion</strong>: We come through this in one Piece, can
we keep the horses?</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: Crapped out. Okay, we’re in.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: The minute we start we’ll be Going against
local and county Law. If we fail the U.S. Government won’t be able to
lift A finger to help us. Nevertheless I want you to understand we carry
The full force and authority of The law of this land.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Raise your right hands. Do you Solemnly swear
to uphold the laws And constitution of the United States of America and
to protect her citizens to the best of your Ability, even at the cost of
your Own life?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Oh… All right.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: You know why I’m here. My Hypocrisy only goes
so far.</p>
<p><strong>lucinda</strong>: Wait!</p>
<p><strong>lucinda</strong>: Your colors.</p>
<p><strong>wagonmaster</strong>: Good luck, boys. And give ’em hell!</p>
<p><strong>lucinda’s son</strong>: Wyatt Earp, the two-gun man,
Whistling death and bloody Murder! Wyatt the widow-maker, Avenging and
bright, purple Poison on horseback with Lightning in his eye and thunder
In his heart! Wyatt and his he- Devils, holy terrors and true, Five
black centaurs blowin’ fire And quicksilver! Ride out and Charge and
shoot and strike and Cleave and hack and thrust home! Don’t let up and
give no rest and Never call retreat till the last One’s smashed and
smote and Runnin’ for cover. Best ’em all And break ’em up and bang
their Heads together in a bunch and Give no quarter though they be Ten
times ten thousand!</p>
<p><strong>illinois mother</strong>: What’re you doing?</p>
<p><strong>illinois father</strong>: Someday he’ll be able to say he Was
there when Wyatt Earp rode Out to bring the law.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: All right, let’s wring ’em out!</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: Like flyin’, son. Just like flyin’.</p>

<p><strong>pony deal</strong>: Look!</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Look out!</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: United States Marshals! Reach!</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Say something witty.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Hey, you can’t come-</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: One more word and I’ll blind you. Get over
there!</p>
<p><strong>pony deal</strong>: Hey brother, what’re you doin’-</p>
<p><strong>mcmasters</strong>: I ain’t your brother, I ain’t None of
your damn brothers. Move!</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: All right, run ’em off.</p>
<p><strong>swilling</strong>: Bastard! Stinkin’ bastard! Like To eat you
blood raw!</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: All right, breed. Dig in.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: It appears he missed an excellent Chance to
keep his mouth shut.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Felt his liver go on that last One. Get him
to a doctor or he’ll Be dead in a couple hours.</p>
<p><strong>mcmasters</strong>: Florentino! He’s getting away!</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Drop his horse.</p>
<p><strong>florentino</strong>: I don’t kill your brother! I Don’t even
know him. I was only Lookout. It was money, they give Me twelve dollars!
It was money!</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: A human life. Twelve dollars.</p>
<p><strong>florentino</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Look at him. That’s how you’ll All end up if
you don’t get it Through your head: it’s over, The Cowboys’re finished.

harder from here in. Should’ve held out for more money.</p>

<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: What makes a man like Ringo, Doc? What makes
him do the things he does?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: A man like Ringo’s got a great Empty hole right
through the Middle of him and no matter what He does he can’t ever fill
it. He Can’t kill enough or steal enough Or inflict enough pain to ever
Fill it. And it drives him mad. Sick mad. Cold and dirty.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: So what does he want?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: What does he want? He wants revenge.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Revenge? For what?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Being born.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Remember how I said it all Happened so fast
with Curly Bill I didn’t have time to think about it? Well I’ve had
plenty of time To think about this. I spent most Of my life since I was
born not Knowing what I want out of life, Just chasin’ my tail. But now,
For the first time I know exactly What I want. And who. And that’s The
damnable misery of it. I can’t beat him, can I?</p>

<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Drag him out here, let’s have a look.</p>
<p><strong>hooker</strong>: I looked the other way when you Did a lot of
foul things but I Ain’t lettin’ you torment a dyin’ Man. Not as long as
he’s under my Roof. I draw the line there.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: All right, Hooker. I’ll be back In about an
hour. We’ll see how Brave you are then.</p>
<p><strong>hooker</strong>: I’ll be here.</p>

through This alive. You’ve preserved me This far so I only ask one more
Favor: just let me live long Enough to kill that man. Thy will Be done
and there’s an amen to it.</p>
<p><strong>ringo</strong>: Well, didn’t think you had it in you. Shall

got to finish. Play for blood, remember?</p>

circumstances, don’t you Agree? A better one might be how Do you

<p><strong>doc</strong>: You think I’m kidding. You’re the Most
fallible, wrong-headed, self- Deluding, just generally Benighted jackass
I’ve ever Known. Yet, withal, even at your Worst, you’re the only human
Being in my entire life who ever Gave me hope.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: All I ever wanted was to live a Normal
life.</p>
