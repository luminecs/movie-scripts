<h1 id="all-about-steve">all-about-steve</h1>
<p><strong>tnt. kitchen - day</strong>: A New York Times crossword
puzzle. The hand of MARY HOROWITZ scratches the answers in ink without
pausing even a second between each one.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Vita aenigma est. Life is a puzzle. It is.
Specifically, life is most like a crossword puzzle. There are a million
reasons why, not the least of which is that life, like crosswords,
requires the use of your whole entire brain- Her writing hand knocks a
glass of grape soda and it spills all over the puzzle.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Crap. The puzzle answers all run together.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Four letter word for… vomit. She takes a deep
breath to calm her nerves. it doesn’t help.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Not “barf”. For sure not “barf”. That’s too
easy. “Puke” is okay, but maybe a bit pedestrian … I like “hurl”. I do.
I like the way it rolls off your tongue – the word, I mean. But my all
time favorite is none of those. She puts her head between her knees,
tries to keep it together.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Four letter word for vomit? S-P-E- W. Spew…
Sp-ew. A door nearby opens but Mary doesn’t budge. A POLICE OFFICER
walks out. A 40ish female TEACHER pokes her head out the door, signals
to Mary.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: We’re ready for you now. Mary jumps up,
grabs her purse .</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Jesus help me.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Here’s a treat, students. Our final guest
for Career Day, Miss Mary Horowitz, is the crossword constructor for the
Atlanta Citizen. You know the crossword puzzles you see every week in
the newspaper? It’s her job to create them. Isn’t that fun? Mary stares
at the Teacher, whispers.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You weren’t supposed to tell them.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Pardon me?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I made a crossword puzzle to help them guess
what my job is. You ruined it.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Oh, I’m so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Maybe you could tell them a bit about what
your job is like? watche s hit</p>
<p><strong>garbage</strong>: Mary drops thu p file out her the bottom
She p lls u hearsed enthusiasm. bag, reads with re</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: People do crossword puzzles all the time but
they don’t often think of the person who made all the words fit
together, and who thought up the clues, and who made sure the little
black squares at the top mirror the ones at the bottom. She pulls one of
the crosswords out of the garbage can, holds it up, turns it upside
down, forces a nervous smile.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Crossword constructors usually have above
average intelligence, with knowledge of just about every subject you can
imagine. And it helps if they can spell. The card in Mary’s hand reads
“LAUGH”. She laughs. Nobody else does. She looks at the cards again,
instantly gets serious, sweeps her hand through the air.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Imagine, for a moment, a world without
crossword puzzles. A world- Mary notices one Kid with his hand up. It
totally throws her off.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Daniel, you have a question?</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: You make a living doing that? Just making
puzzles? The Atlanta Citizen only comes out on Fridays. One puzzle a
week can’t make you enough to live on. A LARGE KID in the front row
pipes up.</p>
<p><strong>large kid</strong>: How do you pay your rent?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: My parents -</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: You live with your parents? The Kids all
laugh their asses off. Mary just stares at them.</p>
<p><strong>large kid</strong>: Oh my God, how old are you? Still living
at home! The kids all laugh some more. Mary’s on the verge of panic.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Children! The Teacher shoots the Kids a
warning look, then notices Mary hyperventilating.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Are you okay? Mary grasps for breath,
struggles to speak.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Water.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Water. Just hang on. The Teacher rushes
out. The kids all stare at Mary.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Yep, I live at home… She forces herself to get
it together, totally faking it.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: But so do all of you, so there… And sure, I
only create one crossword puzzle a week but I have deadlines, I have
stress, I have demands on me so huge you would not believe. The
newspaper business is hell. I mean it. Hell. Somebody’s got to write
about all the horrors that go on in this world.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Me! My crossword puzzle is always good news.
it enlightens. it r andma’s entertains. It keeps your g mind alive so
she remembers to send you five bucks on your birthday. Think about that
as you lie in bed tonight picking your nose and crying yourself to
sleep. I know I will. The Kids just stare at her. She leans against the
teacher’s desk, tries to look relaxed but fails miserably.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: My job matters, you know. In media circles I
am, as the Dutch say, geliefd. That means I have plenty of friends.
Hoards, in fact. Scads even. The kids aren’t buying it.</p>
<p><strong>large kid</strong>: You’re a freak. The kids all nod in
agreement. Mary’s frozen, devastated. The Teacher rushes back into the
room with a cup of water, hands it over. Mary sips it like communion
wine. Half of it runs down her chin. Mary looks at the Teacher, fakes a
smile.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: That’s a pretty blouse. The Teacher smiles
back. Awkward.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Twelve letter phrase for smashing success! She
heads down the walkway toward the bus stop.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: As one would say in old Paris… Coup de maitre!
A CUSTODIAN cleaning the school yard looks up. Mary keeps on talking -
now to him.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: It means “master stroke”, even though the
direct translation is actually “master blow”… Leave it to the French to
pass off an unpleasant slave activity as an everyday expression. The
Custodian doesn’t know what the hell she’s talking about. Mary continues
on to the bus stop.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I sometimes suffer from benign positional
vertigo. Could you please not drive until I’m - f He ignores her, starts
driving. Mary struggles toward the back o f the bus, grabbing g
goes.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Excuse me… pardonnez-moi… begnadiyen sie mich…
She lurches for an empty seat and just about dislodges her shoulder on
the center pole. Finally settled, she peeks under her sweater at the
shoulder damage.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Hello hematoma. She smiles at an angry ELDERLY
LADY sitting across from her. The lady gives her the “don’t talk to me”
glare, then stares out the window. Mary fidgets in her seat.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: In crosswords, as in life, some days are
harder than others. It’s true. In the New York Times, for example, the
puzzles get harder as the week goes. So on Monday, a day that
traditionally bites the big one, the crossword is super easy. It’s
comforting to know that although life can be difficult at times,
crosswords let you off easy when you need it the most. Mary looks around
for anybody to talk to. The other PASSENGERS avert their eyes. Mary
starts biting her nails.</p>
<p><strong>koncha, takihashi-san!</strong>: He ignores her. Mary hands
the papers to Betty.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Hi Betty. Betty just rings up the papers.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Did you see the review of “Hairspray” in the
Journal yesterday? They used the word “spectacular” – always a good
sign. Maybe you’d like to go see it with rne? I have a coupon for five
dollars off. Betty shoves the newspapers back across the counter, points
at them, then speaks in barely recognizable English.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Nine dollar twenty. Mary fishes in her bag
for money.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: We could bring your dad if you want. I don’t
think the show is ageist. That means he won’t feel like a loser for
being old. As she takes her time paying, Mr. Takihashi madly gestures
about Mary holding up the line. Betty barks at her.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Pecha kucha! Do Itta! Betty takes Mary’s
money, waves her on and helps the next customer.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: So no then? That’s a no? Betty ignores her.
Mary waits, loads the newspapers into her bag.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Sometimes crosswords are even better than
life. Here’s how. They don’t discriminate. Crosswords don’t care if
you’re young or old; black or white; male, female or intersex.
Crosswords only care if you’re an idiot. And, really, that’s okay,
because if you have the IQ of a yam, finishing a crossword should be the
least of your worries. Mary glances up at the TV news once more, then
walks away.</p>
<p><strong>50’s</strong>: Steve heads to an open van where a disheveled,
mid producer ANGUS MCCORMACK checks his watch.</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: Where the hell is he?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Probably doing his nails. – paper 40ish
reporter HARTMAN HUGHES rushes to the van on his face. napkin tucked in
his shirt collar, bread crumbs</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: What do you mean “the big one”? Terrorists,
natural disaster, what?</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: Pandemic. Hartman’s eyes light up.</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: Half of the Midwest and spreading. Nobody’s
safe. Steve tries on a gas mask.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Please let it be the bird flu.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Bird flu is for pussies. This thing’s
unstoppable.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: How’s it spreading? Angus looks at
Steve.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Squirrels. Hartman can barely contain his
excitement.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Oh my God, they’re everywhere!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Al Qaeda connection?</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: Always a possibility.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Who wishes he was in Iraq now?</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Not me!. Hartman grabs a gas mask and
rushes to the van’s side mirror.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: I need blush. No, wait. I’ll go pasty.
It’ll look like I could be the first media victim. “Hartman Hughes, no
such thing as too close to the story”. Hartman looks back at Steve and
Angus. They’re just standing there, unable to keep a straight face.
Hartman deflates.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Assholes! I knew it was too good to be
true. He throws his gas mask down, storms off.</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: Hartman, come on. Hartman gets in the
elevator, hollers out to them.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: I had a perfectly good bologna sandwich
going on upstairs. Wasted! Angus and Steve watch the elevator door
close, shrug it off.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Next E-coli story breaks, he’ll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Crap.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: “Brilliant” is what they said. Never in the
history of St. Margaret’s Career Day have the children’s brains been so
inordinately stimulated as they were today by my presentation.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. horowitz</strong>: Good for you, sweetie. Mary pulls the
newspapers out of her bag, sorts through them, stacks them on top of the
TV.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: “Inspired”, the teacher told me.</p>
<p><strong>mr. horowitz</strong>: You get the Post? She hands him the
paper.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: “Engrossing” one child exclaimed.</p>
<p><strong>mr. horowitz</strong>: A ten year old said that?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’m sure that’s what he meant. And
“ebullient”-</p>
<p><strong>mr. horowitz</strong>: What happened to your knee? Mary looks
down at the blood dripping down from her knee onto her sock. She’s
completely annoyed - more at the question than the mess.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Dad, some of the greatest orators of all time
had their heads chopped off for their labors. I’m lucky to escape with a
simple flesh wound. Mary hands over the last newspaper, heads out to the
hallway. Her mother yells to her.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. horowitz</strong>: Change those socks before your
date.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I told you I’m not going.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. horowitz</strong>: Mrs. Alchessi says you’ll like this
one.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Mrs. Alchessi has gliomatosis cerebri.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. horowitz</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: A brain tumor characterized by, among other
things, dementia. She’s nuts. Mary walks up the stairs.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. horowitz</strong>: Mary, it’s just a date. This is what
normal girls your age do. Mary stops on the stairs.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’m normal. Silence from her parents. Mary
marches back into the living room.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: In fact, I’m normalis extremes. That’s the
kind of normal that doesn’t get more normal.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hancock</strong>: Of course you are, sweetie.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’ll go. Mary bolts up the stairs to her room.
Mr. and Mrs. Horowitz look at each other, surprised, happy.</p>
<p><strong>mr. horowitz</strong>: You ever want to see grandchildren,
you better burn the damn boots. She swats him with her book, tries not
to laugh.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Carol, tonight I have a date. A blind one. Not
the guy, I mean the situation. We are, as yet, unknown to one another…
It’s nerve wracking, I know. Try not to have a spontaneous epileptiform
seizure. The doorbell rings. Mary freezes, listens for the muffled
voices downstairs. She sits on the corner of her bed and breathes
rapidly into a paper bag. There’s a knock on her bedroom door. Mary
folds up the bag, puts it in her pocket for later, then opens the door a
crack. It’s her mother.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. horowitz</strong>: Guess who’s here.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’d rather not. Mrs. Horowitz opens the door
wider, takes a look at Mary, looks like she’s going to cry.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. horowitz</strong>: Look at you.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: i already did. Repeatedly.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. horowitz</strong>: You’re beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Please don’t mean on the inside.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. horowitz</strong>: Beautiful and smart. And fun. And
interesting. Mary takes a deep breath, lets it out fast.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Let’s hope all that does it for him.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Mary, hi. I’m Steve. She puts up a finger -
“just a second”. She turns around and runs back upstairs. Steve looks at
Mrs. Horowitz, confused.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. horowitz</strong>: And how’s your mother?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Great. Thanks. She just stares at him and
smiles.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Gods. You may have noticed that I’m wearing
clean socks. Translation: I’m really trying and thus should be amply
rewarded. Thanks for your support. She gets up, has a second thought,
gets back onto her knees.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: And by support I don’t mean, you know - She
hikes up her bra.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I mean your assistance, your furtherance, your
advocacy of my efforts to get out there and… do what I’m supposed to do.
She concentrates hard, opens her eyes. Now she’s ready.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. horowitz</strong>: There we go. Mary makes it to the
bottom of the stairs, steps into her red boots. Her mother cringes.
Steve’s a bit surprised at the boots but who cares, Mary’s still hot
from the knee caps up.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Ready? Mary nods a bunch of times.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Mrs. Horowitz. Goodnight. Sir.</p>
<p><strong>mr. horowitz</strong>: You kids have fun.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. horowitz</strong>: Be careful now. Don’t forget your
seatbelts. Mrs. Horowitz sees them out the door then heads into the
living room. She waves to them out the window, trying to hide her worry
but failing miserably.</p>
<p><strong>mr. horowitz</strong>: She’ll be fine. They look at each
other - a bit of hope, a bit of dread.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Sorry about this blind date thing. My mother
-</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I never went to kindergarten! He looks at her,
totally confused.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: They skipped me to the forth grade.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Okay. She gets in the car, fastens her
seatbelt. Steve hesitates then heads to the driver’s side, gets in.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I missed finger painting. He has no clue what
to say.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Sorry?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Me too. She lunges for his lips but the
seatbelt snaps her back inches short.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Whoa! Undeterred by the whiplash, Mary undoes
her seatbelt and tries again, this time making contact with Steve’s
lips. He’s more than a little startled but kisses her back anyway, all
the while straining to see the Horowitz house.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Mary… uh, what about your mother? She
straddles him and keeps kissing.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You’re not her type. And she’s married.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: No, we’re right in front of your house and…
She undoes her sweater.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: And I have no problem with that whatsoever.
She kisses his neck. He looks up with a “thank you, God”.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Steve?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Mary.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Is it Steven with a V or Stephen with a
P-H?</p>
<p><strong>v.</strong>: She works over his face over like it’s an ice
cream cone.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I thought so. There are almost a million
Stevens with a V in the country, you know. It’s much more popular than
the P-H way, almost twice as popular in fact. I think it’s the Brits who
prefer the P-H. They love their P-H’s over there. Not as much as they
love their fish and chips but still, they love them. It was the media
thing, you know, that’s why our moms wanted us to get together. You work
in the media, so do I. We really have to hand it to our moms, Steve, we
do, and not just for raising us, or for thriving during a time when
women painstakingly struggled for equality, but I mean we should hand it
to them for being visionaries and predicting our all encompassing
compatibility. We’re professionally compatible, yes, but it’s occurring
to me at this particular moment that we’re also sexually compatible, and
I don’t know if you noticed like I noticed but we’re also both wearing
blue. What are the chances of that? Actually, if I really think about
it, the chances are probably pretty good. Blue is one of the most
popular three colors, however, yours is- She leans forward and checks
the fabric tag on the neck of his jacket. She can’t quite read it. She
reaches up and flips on the interior light. Steve’s just about blinded.
She grabs the tag, reads.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Nylon. And mine… She grabs her own tag and
reads it, just about elbowing Steve in the eye.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Polyester! See? Both synthetic fibres! And the
chances of that are much smaller than the chances of us just wearing
blue. Steve looks at Mary - suddenly fully aware of her craziness.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Do you like crosswords?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Sure. She just about jumps out of her pants
with excitement.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Me too! And semantics, the study of the
meaning of words? You love words, right?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: What’s not to love.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I know! She can hardly believe her good
fortune. Her mind reels just as fast as her lips.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Steve with a V, you know what we are? We’re
didymous. Two of a kind. Two rare earth elements brought together by
Norns, that’s Scandinavian for The Destinies. You want to make out for
ten to fifteen minutes more then go get a six pack of Twinkies and
Mountain Dew and stay up all night and talk? Steve is frozen. No escape
- then it hits him. He jumps a bit, pulls out his cell phone.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Sorry. I have to get this.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I didn’t hear it ring.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Vibrate.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I didn’t feel it</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You didn’t? This is Steve… What? Really? Now?
If I don’t have a choice…</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Work. I have to go to… Boston. This happens
all the time. You know how it is. Wherever news happens… Mary gets off
of him, slides back into her seat, buttons her sweater.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: It’s okay. When you get back we can have
plenty of quality time.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Sure. I’ll call you. He leans over, opens her
door.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Steve, this has been a night to remember.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: No kidding. You certainly are - He searches
for any word that will do. Mary jumps in.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Normal.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You read my mind. Never happier, she jumps
out of the car. As he drives away, she pulls the paper bag out of her
pocket, breathes into it.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. horowitz</strong>: Sweetie, what’s wrong? What happened?
My God, you’ve barely been gone ten minutes. Mary stops on the stairs,
turns back.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Mom, sometimes that’s all you need to know
he’s the one! Mary smiles big, takes the rest of the stairs up two at a
time. Mrs. Horowitz is about to follow her.</p>
<p><strong>mr. horowitz</strong>: That girl makes up her mind the moon
is green, it’s green. Leave her be. It’ll pass. Eventually.
Mrs. Horowitz moves away from the stairs, no less worried.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Eleven letter word for serendipity. She
screams into her pillow.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: The perfect answer: S-E-R-E-N-D-I-P- I-T-Y.
Serendipity. Why would you ever need a better word than that? She sits
up, grabs her notebook, starts to draw out a new crossword puzzle.</p>
<p><strong>soloman</strong>: Let’s split the gardening feature into two
weeks. Keep them in suspense. He steps back, looks at the whole
layout.</p>
<p><strong>soloman</strong>: Looks good. How are we doing here?</p>
<p><strong>soloman</strong>: Five minutes to spare. Look at that. The
Assistant points to a blank corner of page 26. Soloman’s surprised, and
not particularly impressed.</p>
<p><strong>soloman</strong>: Horowitz.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: When I was a fledgling crossword constructor,
I would find comfort in the words of the learned crossword sages. Above
all, my hero is Manny Nosowsky, frequent New York Times contributor and
all around cruciverbial master.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Manny says that a crossword puzzle’s greatness
can be determined by asking three simple questions. She marches in the
direction of the Editor’s office.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Is it solvable? She almost collides with a
mail cart but keeps walking.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Is it entertaining? She arrives at the
Editor’s office, plants her feet in the doorway.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Does it s arkle? She looks down at the
crossword puzzle in her hands, smiles, holds it out for Soloman. Soloman
grabs the crossword and hands it right to the Assistant, who rushes it
out the door.</p>
<p><strong>i can’t get any of these!</strong>: The other Old Lady holds
up her blank crossword, shrugs.</p>
<p><strong>taxi driver</strong>: This is bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: A long haired GUY gets up from his seat, puts his
coat on. male EXECUTIVE sits down and spots the newspaper opened to the
crossword puzzle.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Don’t even bother, man. I don’t know what the
deal is, but it looks like all the answers are –</p>
<p><strong>soloman</strong>: Steve? Mary sits and smiles.</p>
<p><strong>soloman</strong>: Every single answer is “Steve”? Who the
hell is Steve anyway? No wait, I don’t care, but I do care that you
pissed off our readers. Mary’s smile falls a bit.</p>
<p><strong>soloman</strong>: I thought you knew better than to pull
something like this. It’s unprofessional, it’s – to him. He’s too
frustrated, the words aren’t coming</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Romantic?</p>
<p><strong>soloman</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Creativo? That’s Italian for “creative”.</p>
<p><strong>soloman</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: How about -</p>
<p><strong>soloman</strong>: Mary. We’re letting you go.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Oh. up her Kroger She looks like she’s going
to cry. She picks bag, fidgets.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Maybe I could make it up to you by doing a
fishing themed crossword. I know how you love the piscatology. Soloman
shakes his head – it’s done. Mary hesitates then finally gets up.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Okay. I’ll just give you some time then. We’ll
talk next week.</p>
<p><strong>payroll clerk</strong>: She forgot her severance.</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: Don’t you mean “Steverance”? They both
laugh.</p>
<p><strong>the</strong>: waiting for her. She sits down beside him. He
holds up Atlanta Citizen crossword.</p>
<p><strong>mr. horowitz</strong>: Interesting way to go.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Indeed.</p>
<p><strong>mr. horowitz</strong>: They like it? She points to the other
newspaper in his lap.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Finished with the Times? She goes to take the
paper. He stops her.</p>
<p><strong>mr. horowitz</strong>: Neshama, the puzzle. How’d it go? She
looks around. Nowhere to run.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: How do you think? She looks at him – worry all
over his face. She hesitates for a moment then sucks it up.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Because if you’re thinking that they loved it,
that they thought it was imaginative and bold and evocative… you would
be right.</p>
<p><strong>mr. horowitz</strong>: And Steve?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: He works a lot, you know. Travels all the
time. ’Tis possible he has not yet espied it. She picks up the
crossword, admires it.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: But when he does, I’m sure he’ll say, “that
Mary Horowitz… is a catch. Where oh where has she been all my empty
life? From here onward my life will be divided into ‘before I met Mary’
and ‘after I met Mary’ with the second part being far superior. I am
lonely no more. The missing letter in my puzzle has at last been
found.”</p>
<p><strong>mr. horowitz</strong>: I don’t want you getting your hopes up
too much.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: We’re going to hit rush. We’ll have to take
the second flight. Exec. Producer DAN CORBITT walks in, heads straight
for his desk.</p>
<p><strong>corbitt</strong>: You’re set. KDFW’s on site now. Angus and
Steve start to get up.</p>
<p><strong>corbitt</strong>: Hang on. They sit. Corbitt grabs the remote
control, turns the TV on.</p>
<p><strong>corbitt</strong>: Anybody want to tell me about this? He fast
forwards through footage of Hartman reporting from a greenhouse. Corbitt
slows it to normal speed, mutes it. They watch as Hartman interviews an
attractive female BOTANIST holding a test tube with a seedling in it.
Hartman keeps pointing to the seedling - which happens to be right in
front of the Botanist’s generous breasts. The camera gets closer and
closer - each time it pulls away Hartman points to the seedling again to
force the camera in close - basically turning the piece into a giant
boob-fest.</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: Take a look at those… plants. Corbitt pauses
it on the worst shot, looks at Steve.</p>
<p><strong>corbitt</strong>: We can’t use this. Hartman fakes
disgust.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Of course not. Nice camera work, Stevie.
Steve glares at Hartman. Corbitt points at the frozen shot on the TV
screen, looks at Steve.</p>
<p><strong>corbitt</strong>: You want to go back to the Weather Channel,
try that again. Corbitt checks his watch, points them out the door.</p>
<p><strong>corbitt</strong>: Get out of here. Don’t embarrass me in
Dallas. Hartman, Angus and Steve walk out. Steve nods to Hartman -
thanks asshole. In the hallway, Steve’s cell phone rings. He answers
it.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: What?… Mom, let me call you back.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: What page? He finds Mary’s crossword. He
looks at it closely, totally confused. It takes him more than a second
to get it. He laughs – then suddenly reality sets in.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Four letter word for am I going to wait my
whole life for Steve to call? She suddenly stops writing.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Nope. She flails out of the tub like a salmon
heading upstream, grabs a towel barely big enough to cover her. Without
any effort to dry off, she runs out of the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Ow ow ouch. She gets off the banister, slops
the rest of the way down the stairs, jumps into the doorway of the
living room.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: The news is Steve’s life! It’s not just what
he does, it’s who he is, imbedded deep down in his polymer of
nucleotides. I should be out there by his side. That’s what girlfriends
do, isn’t it? Let him concentrate on his work. I’ll concentrate on the
relationship. It won’t be easy, I know, but neither is quantum physics
or… the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle or… paper mache, but I’ve
managed to do fine with those, haven’t I? She looks at her parents. They
sit at a table playing bridge with MR. and MRS. HANCOCK.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. horowitz</strong>: Mary, you remember the Hancocks.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Top of the evening. Mr. Hancock checks out
Mary’s bare legs as she stands in a puddle of bath water. Mrs. Hancock
lifts her husband’s chin, snaps him out of it.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hancock</strong>: Loved this week’s puzzle, dear.
Whoever Steve is, he must be a very lucky young man. Mr. Horowitz gives
Mrs. Hancock a look - “don’t encourage her”.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Exactly! And all I have to do is go to him, be
near him, and do my best to radiate… me. Mr. Horowitz doesn’t like the
sound of this.</p>
<p><strong>mr. horowitz</strong>: And where exactly will this radiation
take place? Mary rushes to the TV, turns it on, flips it to CNN.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Wherever news happens, Dad. Wherever news
happens.</p>
<p><strong>mr. horowitz</strong>: This is nuts. Mary takes the bags from
him.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Abe, Catherine, I’m off. I don’t know where
I’m going - The Greyhound Bus DRIVER hollers from behind her.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Dallas.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Geographically yes, I know. Figuratively,
philosophically, spiritually, much less so. My entire life is before me.
The world is my ostrea edulis… That means the edible kind of oyster.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. horowitz</strong>: That’s beautiful, sweetie. You sure
you won’t take mine instead? She tries to switch her leather bag for
Mary’s Kroger bag. Mary resists, points back and forth between the two
bags.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Mom, two handles, two handles, they both hold
stuff, what’s the difference? Mrs. Horowitz goes to explain, gives
up.</p>
<p><strong>mr. horowitz</strong>: That Steve shows any disrespect,
you’re on the next bus back here.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Disrespect. Do you mean unmannerly, tactless,
vulgar? Because he’s a straight man, Dad, and some things can’t be
helped. But if you mean inconsiderate to me, contemptuous toward me,
insulting, irreverent, uncivil -</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Let’s go already! She steps up one more
step, yells out to her parents and the</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I don’t know when I’ll be back but I do know
this- The door shuts in her face.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’m not coming back alone.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Paula, what started out as a routine
rehearsal here at the Dallas Medieval Times turned deadly when an
employee allegedly turned on his fellow performers. Twenty- four hours
later, at least thirty employees are still being held hostage by the
assailant, their lives hanging in the balance. He listens to his
earpiece, nods.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: The castle you see behind me is one of
eight medieval Times dinner theatre restaurants. Guests who cross the
drawbridge enjoy a medieval style feast while watching the main
attraction: knights engaging in a battle of strength and skill. The
restaurant promises “fun, feasting and fighting” but it appears that
this time, fun was in short supply. A few feet away, Angus frantically
takes notes as he talks to a MAINTENANCE WORKER, then slips a piece of
paper to Hartman.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Paula, devastating news just in. We have
one confirmed death - an Andalusian - a purebred Spanish horse. One of
many that perform in the show, and the first innocent victim of a rogue
knight’s rage… He takes a moment to fake compose himself, barely getting
the words out.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: At times like this, I like to think there’s
a heaven just for horses. A rolling meadow, lush grasses, unlimited
supply of… those things horses like to lick - or is that cows?
Nevertheless, a beautiful, peaceful place. He turns and looks toward to
the Medieval Times.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: May you long roam in that heaven, noble
horse - Angus hands him another note. Hartman scans it, instantly kills
the fake anguish.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: But not quite yet. We’re the first to
report, the horse is not dead, Paula. Not dead. The horse is alive and
well after having merely fainted, as it was trained to do for the show.
One happy, blessed miracle…</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Dammit, Angus. Get it a bit closer to right
before you hand it to me. Josh moves in, removes Hartman’s mic.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: But then we wouldn’t have heard about horse
heaven. Josh and Angus laugh.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: It’s that kind of genius that won me the
Southeast Idaho Christian Family Coalition’s Journalist of the Year
award, you ingrates.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Omaha… Einstein… cholera… grenade… Bach… oui…
potbelly… Oreo. The man drops the crossword, glares at her.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Sorry. She looks away, starts biting her
nails, then spots a sign on the freeway, calls-out to the Driver and
anybody else who will listen.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Bessemer, Alabama! Named after Sir Henry
Bessemer, a Brit. Guess what he did? Perfected the way steel is made, of
course.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You know what else is in Bessemer? The city, I
mean? Hitler’s typewriter. It’s crazy, I know. That guy was such an
asshole. The Driver’s eyes glaze over. Please let this and.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: We’ll just take five minutes here. He steps
off the bus. Mary turns to the man next to her.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Can you watch my stuff? He glares at her – you
have got to be kidding. Mary grabs her backpack and Kroger bag and steps
off the bus.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Perhaps the greatest obstacle the hostage
negotiators face is the suspect’s refusal to communicate using modern
day technology. In keeping with his role as a medieval knight, he’s
insisting on an eleventh century messenger to deliver all communication.
The screen splits with a female news ANCHOR.</p>
<p><strong>anchor</strong>: What are we talking about here, Hartman?
Carrier pigeons?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Homing pigeons. A few of the Diners
overhear.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Actually, homing pigeons. The Diners look
at Mary.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Carrier pigeons, despite their name, are more
or less useless when it comes to actually carrying anything. Homing
pigeons are better for messenger work… The Diners lose interest. Mary
catches the eye of a WANDERER at the end of the counter. He’s hanging on
her every word.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You know who used them all the time? Genghis
Khan. Loved the pigeons, scared to death of pooches though. The Wanderer
just stares at her.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You know, dogs, canines, de honden? Still
nothing. She looks back at the TV.</p>
<p><strong>anchor</strong>: Have the negotiators located any homing
pigeons? Where do you even get them in this day and age?</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: You can buy them on the internet for
twenty-five bucks a pop. Mary looks at the Diners, smiles, points to the
TV.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: My boyfriend is probably holding that camera
right now. The Diners ignore her and just eat their pie. Mary realizes
the time, runs out of the rest stop.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Crap! Crap, crap, crap! She looks down the
road – no sign of the bus anywhere. She takes her paper bag out of her
pocket, breathes into it. A TRUCK DRIVER passes her with coffee in hand,
on his way to his rig.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Do you know when the next bus to Dallas goes
through here?</p>
<p><strong>truck driver</strong>: Can’t say I do.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I missed mine. She breathes double time into
the paper bag. He takes pity on her.</p>
<p><strong>truck driver</strong>: I’m headed that way. He points to his
truck. Mary looks at the truck, looks at him, looks at the truck, thinks
about it for a long time.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You ever killed animals? He looks at her,
surprised but amused.</p>
<p><strong>truck driver</strong>: Road kill?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Set a garbage can full of kittens on fire or
anything like that? Now he’s disturbed.</p>
<p><strong>truck driver</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Humans?</p>
<p><strong>truck driver</strong>: Would I tell you if I did?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Touche, sir. Touche. Mary thinks some
more.</p>
<p><strong>truck driver</strong>: Wait for the next bus if that suits
you. He climbs into the truck. Mary runs to catch up with him.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Do you have a .light? Matches, Zippo, blow
torch, et al?</p>
<p><strong>truck driver</strong>: Afraid not.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: May I see your license? Why not. He pulls his
license out of the visor, flashes it. Mary steps up and grabs it, looks
at it closely.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Norman James Durwood.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Mary Magdalene Horowitz.</p>
<p><strong>truck driver/norm</strong>: Good to meet you… I think. Still
holding the license, she digs in her Kroger bag, pulls out a large black
magic marker. She pushes up her sleeve and writes Norm’s license number
in huge print down her arm.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Norm, if you’re going to rape and murder me,
you’ll have to cut me up into a million chunks and scatter me all over
four states, otherwise this appendage - She holds her arm up, shows
him.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Will lead homicide detectives right to you.
She smiles at him warmly, puts the marker back in her bag.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: And you already told me you don’t have a light
to burn the flesh off. Norm can’t believe this. Before he can say a
word, Mary moves around to the passenger side, hops up into the truck.
She notices some snacks on the dash.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Moon Pies! Want to go halfsies? At a loss,
Norm motions for Mary to help herself. As she unwraps a Pie, he
reluctantly starts up the truck.</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: Rebecca wants you to come for dinner when
we’re back home. Her cousin from Florida -</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: It’s a set up.</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: She’s hot.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I don’t care. Never again. My mom set me up
with this chick -</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: You let you mother set you up? What the hell
is wrong with you? There’s a commotion in the distance. Every
photographer on the grounds focuses on the castle. Reporters jump into
position. Hartman touches up his make-up, roots through his bag. He
yells out to Steve, Angus and Josh.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Which one of you bastards hid my bronzing
shimmer? The police surrounding the castle take aim. Dead silence as the
Medieval Times drawbridge lowers. A KNIGHT walks out, arms raised as
high as his squeaking armor will allow, which is not very high, but high
enough to get the point across – Surrender.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: And my other rule about crossword puzzles is
this. No pencils. Doing a crossword with a pencil is like screaming with
your lips duct taped together. It’s weak.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Quiet time might be good right about now.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Oh. She thinks about it, whispers.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Do you mean quiet as in softly hushed like
this? Or do you mean quiet, as in silent? He nods. Mary squeezes her
lips together, holds them. It lasts for about a second.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Norm?</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Thanks for not raping me.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: My pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Eight letter word for “screwed”. Mary crosses
to the Medieval Times parking lot, steps over the police line blowing in
the wind.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: F-A-S-T-E-N-E-D. Fastened.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: That’s what’s great about crosswords, and
life. Every once in a while, you get a surprise. She heads back to the
interstate, starts walking.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: All roads lead to Oklahoma, Papa.</p>
<p><strong>mr. horowitz</strong>: Last time I checked, freeway 20 still
heads right back here.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: My road, dad. My road. You don’t commit to a
relationship and then give up because you’d rather be at home curled up
in front of the fireplace with a thesaurus. This is what people are
supposed to do - go out on a limb for love. My limb just happens to be
in Oklahoma. It’s only 850 miles away from home. No big deal.</p>
<p><strong>mr. horowitz</strong>: Oklahoma. Images of the Oklahoma
hospital vigil are everywhere. Captions like “Breaking News: Baby Peggy”
flash across the screen.</p>
<p><strong>koco reporter</strong>: Eleven months ago, the child we’ve
come to know as Baby Peggy was born with an extremely rare birth defect,
a third leg. Shortly after the birth, her parents Misty and Bill Dunlevy
separated. Now with joint custody, one parent wants the baby to keep the
third leg, the other wants it gone… A few feet away, a female FOX NEWS
REPORTER is on camera.</p>
<p><strong>fox news reporter</strong>: After months of legal wrangling,
a judge has ordered in favor of the mother. Amputation surgery is
scheduled for Wednesday but the father, Bill Dunlevy, isn’t about to
give up. As his lawyers work to secure an injunction, the devoted father
rallies public support for the extra limb.</p>
<p>****: “God wouldn’t have given my child the third leg if he didn’t
want her to keep it.” But for now, the fate of that precious child’s
third leg is the hands of a judge… This is Hartman Hughes reporting,
live from Oklahoma City. Steve signals they’ve cut, lowers his camera.
Hartman calls out to Angus.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: What if next time I say Baby Peggy is like
the wishbone of her parents’ dispute? Hartman acts out a wishbone pull.
Steve’s disgusted.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Yeah, go ahead and suggest that. Corbitt will
love it. Steve turns and looks toward the edge of the fenced off
hospital grounds. Dozens of PROTESTORS are camped out - a sorry
assortment of oddballs standing at the fence, waving their signs: “SPARE
THE LEG”, and “HONOR THE FATHER”. Many of them carry drawings of a three
legged baby wearing a halo. Steve braces himself and heads for the
crowd. Half way across, he spots a loner walking from the parking lot.
He’s 35, chubby, his shirt buttoned one button off so it hangs lower on
the left. This is HOWARD. In one hand: a pro-leg sign. In his other
hand: a carton of chocolate milk. Howard stops to lick up the chocolate
milk spilling all over his arm. Steve catches up with him.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Mind if I ask you a few questions on
camera?</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: How do you feel about what’s going on
here?</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: I haven’t made up my mind yet. Both parties
have valid arguments.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Please God, no. He looks for a place to hide
but she’s running ridiculously fast. It’s too late. She’s only a few
feet away.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Steve! She jumps into his arms but he’s only
got one arm free and isn’t about to use it to catch her. She slides down
his leg to the ground but quickly picks herself up.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’m here! Surprised?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Surprised?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Astounded, flabbergasted, bushwacked - He
pulls Mary off to the side, away from everybody.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Talking to you. And noticing how the Oklahoma
climate agrees with your complexion.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Tell me you didn’t come all the way here just
to see me.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Of course not… I went to Dallas looking for
you first. And you know why? Steve grabs his head. This is not
happening.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Because you’re inimitable and I’m
intransigent.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: No, we’re not. I don’t know what that means
but trust me. We’re so not.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: It means you’re awesome and I’m
unstoppable.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Great. Listen, Mary, you seem like a nice
girl, and the ten minutes we spent together were –</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Mind blowing. At a complete loss, he just goes
along.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Sure, but I’m working here. Working.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I know. I’m just here to support you, show you
I care, and also ask why you aren’t following that guy pretending to be
a nurse but obviously not wearing sterilizable, non-slip footwear. Steve
looks toward the hospital, spots the Man.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: If I was Baby Peggy’s dad, that’s how I’d
avoid the press too. Steve takes off running. Mary yells out to him.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’ll be right here in case you want to make
out later on! Steve looks back, a bunch of people stare. Mary waves to
him then watches until he’s out of sight. A SECURITY GUARD approaches
her.</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: Miss, if you want to be here, you’re
going to have to stay behind the fence. Mary turns to see what he’s
pointing at - the growing crowd of protestors off in the distance. They
wave their signs around, cry, sing and sway together, their painful song
barely audible from afar.</p>
<p><strong>protestors</strong>: Near, far, wherever you are, we believe
that the leg should stay on… Mary watches, paralyzed with awe, like
seeing herself in the mirror for the first time ever. At last, she has
found her people.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I like your boots.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Thanks. I found them in an alley. Elizabeth
looks at the boots again, impressed. She stands up.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Are you pro-leg or anti-leg?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Neither really.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: This is the pro-leg group over here.
We’re supporting Baby Peggy’s dad in his fight to save the baby’s third
leg. She points to the end of the fenced off area where only a few
protestors hold anti-leg signs:“NORMAL LIFE FOR BABY PEGGY”,</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Those are the anti-leggers. They’re all
for the amputation.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’m just here because my boyfriend is working
the story. He’s with CNN, the world’s news leader, the most trusted name
in news, the place where more -</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: The pro-leggers have better snacks.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’m definitely pro-leg.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. horowitz</strong>: There she is! Abe, look! There she is
right there. Mr. Horowitz glances up from his book.</p>
<p><strong>mr. horowitz</strong>: She’s going to set her hair on fire
with that candle.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. horowitz</strong>: Look, she’s made friends.
Mrs. Horowitz tries not to cry.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: She’s on me what, thirty seconds after
meeting me, and the chick will not shut up the whole time. I had to fake
a work call, gave her the -</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: Wherever news goes…</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I think I’m in the clear, then she does this
crossword - she works for the Citizen - she does this crossword all
about me, and as if that’s not crazy enough, she shows up here.</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: Here?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Over by the fence. Red boots. Can’t miss
her.</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: Is she hot?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Jesus, Angus. When a psychotic chick’s
swinging a machete at your throat, who cares if she’s hot?</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: I’ve been married to the same woman for
seventeen years. I care.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Crazy, man. The chick is cra-zy. Hartman sits
up, totally awake and never happier. He points at Steve.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Priceless! This is priceless! Steve
cringes.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Hughes, don’t. Don’t even.</p>
<p><strong>protestor wife</strong>: All we’re saying is, wait until Baby
Peggy can talk and ask her what she wants to do with the spare.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Thanks, Bruno. He walks away. Mary takes a sip
of the hot chocolate, burns her mouth.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Crap. She grabs her tongue with her fingers.
Hartman appears right in front of her.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: M’lady. She’s a bit stunned and star
struck. He offers his hand.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Hartman Hughes. Mary lets go of her tongue,
uses her saliva covered hand to shake his.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Mary.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Mary’. Mary, Mary, Mary. He takes his hand
back, discretely wipes it on his pants.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Steve told me you were beautiful. He was
going on and on and on and on about it. I had to come see for myself.
Great boots.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Thank y- He puts an arm around her, pulls her
away from the crowd.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Listen, Mary, I’ve been working with Steve
for about a year now. The guy is like a brother to me. A YOUNG PROTESTOR
recognizes Hartman.</p>
<p><strong>young protestor</strong>: Hartman Hughes’. Without missing a
step, Hartman grabs a pen from his pocket and autographs the guy’s sign
whether he wants it or not, then continues on with Mary.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Girls follow us around everywhere we go.
Who do you think they’re after? Hartman reflects on it, smiles.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Me, of course me, but every once in a while
some of them try to land Steve. It’s true. Sure he’ll go for a few
skanks here and there but it’s all just a sad attempt to hide his fear.
All he wants is to love but he’s afraid of opening up, afraid of putting
himself out there, afraid of somebody like you, Mary - yes you - afraid
of you breaking his heart. Can you blame him? She’s a bit stunned and
confused by all of this.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: No! Promise me this. Promise you’ll stick
around long enough to help him get over that fear. He tells you to go
away, don’t. He says he thinks you’re crazy? You’re not. He’s crazy,
Mary. Crazy not to let down his walls and tell you how he really feels.
Can I count on you to hang in there no matter what?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Of course. I don’t want to interfere in his
work but I just need to be here for him and - He grabs her, hugs her in
so her words are all muffled - and yet she keeps talking.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Good girl. The SECURITY GUARD walks past,
gestures that they should be behind the fence. Hartman holds up his
press pass to get rid of the Guard, then lets go of Mary. He points her
toward the protestors, starts backing away.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: I’ll tell Steve to come find you when we
wrap for the day. What side are you on?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Pro-leg. She shows him her button featuring a
cartoon of a very happy three legged baby. Hartman laughs.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: You might want to jump camps. No way
they’re going let that baby keep the third leg and live like a freak.
Trust me. He waves and turns around, starts heading for the press camp.
Mary calls out to him.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: She’d just be like the tree frogs. Hartman
turns around. What?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: A trematode parasite causes polymely in tree
frogs. It happens all the time. In some ponds there’s like a quarter of
the tree frogs with extra legs. Totally natural. Hartman looks at her
like she’s a nutcase.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: What’s going on? Josh rushes to get the mic
on Hartman.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: The parents of the kid got back together.
Surgery’s cancelled.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: No amputation?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Tell me you weren’t talking to Mary.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Go to hell, Hughes. scans it Angus hands
Hartman the press release. Hartman quickly.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: It’s over? The kid keeps the leg.</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: For now. Hartman checks his teeth in a hand
mirror.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: ’Til she gets it caught in a car door.</p>
<p><strong>koco reporter</strong>: With mere hours to spare, the
Dunlevys reconciled, agreeing to halt surgery until Baby Peggy is old
enough to decide for herself. Further down the row of reporters:</p>
<p><strong>fox news reporter</strong>: And while dozens of children
fight for their lives behind these walls, Baby Peggy won’t be one of
them. With surgery cancelled, it’s time for the Dunlevys to be a family
once again. Past a few more news crews, at the end the line, Steve has
the camera on Hartman.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: And like the noble tree frog whose extra
leg is nothing if not natural, so Baby Peggy begins the rest of her
three legged life… This is Hartman Hughes reporting live from Oklahoma
City. Hartman pulls out his ear piece. Angus, Josh and Steve all look at
him, a bit surprised.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Tree frog? Where do you get this shit?
Hartman taps the side of his head – it’s all up here.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: A little thing called astutitude, my
friends. Steve and Angus look at each other – is that even a word?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: There you go, George. Just a little
nasolacrimal duct cleaning. Nothing to be ashamed of. Elizabeth runs up
to Mary, hugs her.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: You see? When you sing loud enough and
when your signs are big enough, people listen! Mary spots some of the
news vans pulling away.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Steve!</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Go, go on. I’ll watch your stuff. Mary
drops her bags, runs toward the media camp.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Steve! STEVE!</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Angus, hold up.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: No, go. Fast. Hartman rolls down his
window.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Don’t. Hartman sticks his head out the
window.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Hughes, I swear I’ll kill you. Hartman waves
to Mary to catch up. Angus sees her in the mirror as he drives.</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: Is that her? She’s hot.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Angus, come on man, get me out of here.</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: She’s really hot.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Who cares? Jesus, you guys - Angus hits the
brakes. Steve hides behind the seat just as Mary catches up with the
van.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Hi beautiful. Mary tries to get a look at
Steve but can only see part of his back hunched over behind the
seat.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Steve? Are you okay? Is he okay? Angus leans
over to her window.</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: I don’t think we’ve met. Angus. Mary shakes
Angus’ hand. He can’t take his eyes off her.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Steve’s not feeling well.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Oh no.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: I’m sure he’ll be fine by the time we get
to New Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: Your eyes are striking. Steve punches him
through the seat. Mary’s oblivious.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Steve really wants you to follow us. It
would mean a lot to him.</p>
<p><strong>stays</strong>: Steve cringes, goes to speak up but stops
himself and hidden.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: He was going to go ask you himself but look
at the poor bastard. So sick he can’t even sit up straight.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What if it’s a viral zoonotic disease? He
should see a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Exactly what I told him, but the only
person he wants touching his infected flesh is you. Mary looks at Steve,
worried.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: But wait, what if - up. Hartman grabs her
face, squishes her lips to shut her</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Hey now, we need you to be strong for him.
Leachinan trial, Santa Fe, can you remember that? Mary nods, unable to
speak.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: We’ll meet you there, God willing.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Will you take care of him?</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Like he’s my own. She backs away from the
window. Angus waves to her and starts driving.</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: Nothing wrong with that one.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Except for those boots.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You’re an asshole, Hughes. Hartman
laughs.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Elizabeth! I have to meet Steve at his next
job, in New Mexico. He’s sick, not as in rad, although he is that too,
but more like unwell, infirm, perhaps barfy. Hopefully nothing serious
but you never can be too sure and besides, healthy or not, he needs
me.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Sign my book before you go? Elizabeth
hands her the ratty hand decorated book and a pen.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: The trip’s not too long, right through all
kinds of interesting sites like, for example, El Santuario de Chimayo:
The Lourdes of America. Know what that is? A sacred sand pit near a
burrito stand. What could be better than that? Mary looks away from
Elizabeth, fidgets a bit.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Want to go? Unless you’re busy, I mean. You
probably have something better to do. Elizabeth thinks about it.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Not really. Mary is stunned. She takes a
minute to realize it’s real, gets excited. From behind her:</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: I’ll go too. Mary turns around and spots
Howard.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Mary, have you met Howard? Mary shakes
her head. Howard offers his hand. It’s got dried chocolate milk all over
it. She takes it.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Mary, Howard. Howard, Mary. Mary,
Howard’s got a car, you know. He can drive us. Mary looks at him, thinks
about it.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What kind of car do you have?</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Plymouth Colt.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What year?</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Eighty-nine. Mary quickly scans her
memory.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Replace the recalled seat belts?</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Yes. Mary thinks about it, smiles.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Let’s grab souvenirs! Elizabeth and Howard
each pick up a Baby Peggy sign off the ground. Mary grabs as many as she
can hold – way, way too many. A bunch of them slide off but she
perseveres.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Here’s something you never see in crosswords,
two letter words, and thank goodness for that. The word “go”: not fun.
The word “vamoose”: super fun. You see? crosswords are just like life in
that way - they’re only boring if you have no sense of adventure.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: You can have that. I have more.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Thanks. Mary puts the apple in her Kroger
bag.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Howard, if you get sleepy and want to trade
off driving for a while, just wake me up and I’ll take over.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Persimmon. AKA, the mabolo, the date-plum, the
velvet apple. Genus: Diospyros.</p>
<p><strong>inside edition reporter</strong>: This tragedy began eight
months ago in what was once paradise - the Elysium Sanctuary outside of
Taos, New Mexico. For years, celebrities considered the five star
meditation resort the only true place for spiritual purification, and
with good reason. Nestled in the heart of reclaimed Pueblo Indian lands,
the Elysium Sanctuary promised one thing - enlightenment. A COURT TV
REPORTER is on camera a few feet away.</p>
<p><strong>court tv reporter</strong>: But the Elysium Sanctuary would
never be the same after tragedy struck last winter. Twenty-six year old
resort masseuse Juan Carlos Velasquez found stabbed to death in the
meditation villa of beloved star of stage and screen, Cloris
Leachman.</p>
<p><strong>extra! reporter</strong>: Publicists for the eighty year old
Leachman insist her relationship with the deceased Velasquez was no
different than with the dozens of other resort personnel attending to
Ms. Leachman during her solitude retreat. At the end of the row, Hartman
reports.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: But the octogenarian Leachman may not have
been as innocent as her representatives claimed, at least according to
the evidence found at the murder scene. Hartman reads from his
notes.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Whips, hot wax, bamboo skewers, a spanking
bench, and perhaps most damaging, a henna tattoo across Ms. Leachman’s
chest that read “Mrs. Juan Carlos Velasquez”.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Guilty or not? They all think about it. A
greasy haired Shaman CLYDE steps up behind them.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Everybody deserves the benefit of the doubt.
He looks at Mary, smiles.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Everybody. As he joins the Leachman fans,
Mary thinks about it.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Be has a point.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Yay! I love Cloris Leachman.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Who doesn’t?</p>
<p><strong>mexican mourners</strong>: jMuerte! iMuerte! iMuerte!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I have to go find Steve. How do I look?
Unwashed hair, bed head, and there’s a chunk of a Twinkie caked onto
Mary’s ear. Elizabeth picks the Twinkie off, smooths down Mary’s
hair.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Perfect.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’ll be back. Save me a sign! And if Cloris
comes out, tell her I loved her in “My Little Pony: The Movie”. Mary
runs off as Howard and Elizabeth join the crowd of fans.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Hi gorgeous. What’d you do to your
hair?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Slept on it in the car. Where’s Steve? Is he
okay?</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Never better. Come in and wait. He’ll be
back soon.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: You all know Mary? Steve’s girlfriend? Mary
shakes hands around the table, greets them all in their native
tongues.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Hello… Bonjour… Hola… Jolly afternoon… She
gets to Angus. He kisses her hand.</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: My dear, sit. He shoves the BBC guy out of
the way to make room for Mary next to him. Vince shuffles the cards.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Mary, you in?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Poker? Technically I’m familiar but I’ve never
actually played. With people, I mean.</p>
<p><strong>spanish journalist</strong>: She’s in. Doug throws in some
cash as Vince starts to deal.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: “There are few things that are so unpardonably
neglected in our country as poker.” Guess who said that one. She looks
around the table. The guys, except Angus, are starting to lose their
patience.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Mark Twain. And you know what else-</p>
<p><strong>bbc news photographer</strong>: Darling, you in or not?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Sorry. Mary looks at her cards, thinks about
it for way too long, then grabs a handful of coins from her Kroger bag,
slaps them on the table.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Send it, ladies! Steve steps into the tent,
spots Mary, turns to run back out.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Don’t go, Steve! Look who’s here. Mary
jumps up - just about knocks the table over, then sustains a number of
injuries trying to leap over chairs. At last she makes it to Steve, hugs
him.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Thank God you’re okay!</p>
<p><strong>to</strong>: He holds her back at arm’s length, looks at her,
goes speak then stops himself, pulls her outside the tent.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You have to stop stalking me.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’m not. It’s more like picking travel
destinations based on where you happen to be working.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Stalking.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Hartman told me you wanted me here. Now that I
am, what better opportunity for us to get to know each other better.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: This is crazy.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Hartman said you’d say that.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Go home, Mary.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: And he said you’d say that too. It’s just your
fear talking. Steve just about loses it.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: He’s not my friend, he’s not your friend.
He’s just an asshole who thinks it’s fun to string you along and make my
life hell. He yells toward the tent.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Hughes! Get out here!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You know how sometimes you see a pinguid guy
with an attractive girl and you think how the heck did he pull that off?
People won’t think that when they look at us. We’re perfectly matched.
She can hardly contain her excitement.</p>
<p><strong>hughes!</strong>: Hartman peeks out of the tent.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: For the hundredth time, Steve, no, I am not
interested in a threesome with you and your new girlfriend. Steve points
to Mary.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Tell her the truth. About all the crap you
told her.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Okay. Fine. Hartman goes to Mary, grabs her
hand.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Everything I said about Steve, about his
feelings for you, his hopes, his dreams, his fears, his unexplainable
odor, forget about it. Forget everything I said. None of it was true.
Mary’s stunned, devastated. She looks like she’s going to cry. Hartman
and Steve look at each other - what now? Hartman shoves him forward.
Steve reluctantly puts a comforting hand on her shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Because nothing I said comes close to the
enormity of Steve’s real feelings for you!</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: It’s a love that defies words! Steve jumps
him. Hartman fights back. Mary’s horrified.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Stop it, you guys! Stop! “Victory attained by
violence is tantamount to a defeat, for it is momentary.” You know who
said that? Gandhi. And me. Just now. The fight continues. Mary half
covers her eyes.</p>
<p><strong>bbc news photographer</strong>: Fight! They all jump up and
run out of the tent.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Nice one.</p>
<p><strong>bbc news photographer</strong>: Somebody’s going to be crying
in a minute. Angus hugs Mary to “console” her. Hartman gets Steve in a
headlock. Mary can’t even watch.</p>
<p><strong>spanish journalist</strong>: I’m going to go with Hughes on
this one.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Come on, the guy wears makeup. The guys all
start pulling out cash to place bets. Mary spots the cash changing
hands.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: No! This isn’t about money! It’s about
courage, love, honor and all things virtuous and pure. Steve, kick him
in the leberknoedel! Hartman looks up at her, hurt. The distraction
costs him. Steve knees him then follows with a jab to his face.</p>
<p><strong>journalists</strong>: Ohhhh! Hartman drops to his knees,
tries to pull himself together.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Tell her!</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Okay, alright. Hartman wipes his lip, looks
up at Mary.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Mary, millions of people believe what I
tell them every night. Why shouldn’t you? Steve dives at him. Hartman
swings and gets him right in the nose. One of their cell phones ring,
then another, then all the guys’ phones go off.</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: Verdict’s in. They all rush off to the court
house, leaving a stunned Mary standing alone.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: He fought for me. Happiest moment of her
life.</p>
<p><strong>court tv reporter</strong>: The end to a difficult and often
emotional trial, the verdict finally in, Cloris Leachman found not
guilty of the murder of her twenty-six year old lover Juan Carlos
Velasquez. Down the row of journalists, the BBC CREW.</p>
<p><strong>bbc journalist</strong>: After a devastating eight months,
Leachman at last vindicated despite overwhelming evidence against her.
Six more cameras down, the French Reporter.</p>
<p>****: Eyewitness testimony, fingerprints on every inch of the body,
the murder weapon still warm in her Chanel handbag - And finally at the
end of the line, Hartman - his hair a mess, his lip cut, his mood sour.
A few feet away filming, Steve’s nose bleeds down his chin and
shirt.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: And as she left the court room today a free
woman, the cheers of her devoted fans carrying her forward -</p>
<p><strong>oh my god, steve, you’re bleeding!</strong>: The camera is
knocked out of position as Mary rushes Steve. Angus steps in and pulls
her away. A COP grabs her. Mary looks back to Steve as she’s dragged
back to the fan area.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Please! Somebody help him! Apply a
vasoconstrictor, a nasal tampon, anything! At the absolute least, direct
pressure and a clean tissue! Steve puts the camera back in place.
Hartman recovers fast.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: As you can see, Cloris Leachman’s fans have
become surprisingly violent despite her victory here today. Add this to
the list of the most dangerous locations for journalists. Iraq, Somalia,
Lebanon, Sri Lanka… and just about any place Cloris Leachman fans
gather. Hartman wipes blood from his lip.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Hartman Hughes putting his life at risk to
report live from Santa Fe, New Mexico. They cut. Hartman grabs a hand
mirror, points to his face, yells out to Steve.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: This is my gift, understand, my instrument.
Makes no difference if you’re walking around looking like Quasimodo.
Ignoring Hartman, Steve walks over to Angus.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: How long do you figure until - Steve’s phone
rings. He cringes, answers it.</p>
<p><strong>corbitt</strong>: Who the hell was that?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: This girl. She’s been following me… She’s not
my girlfriend… He listens, clenches his teeth, hands the phone to Angus.
As Angus listens, Steve grabs his equipment, waits in dread. Angus hangs
up the phone, hands it back to Steve.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I’m done?</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: Consider yourself temporarily saved by the
storm. It’s worse than they thought. We’ve got to move. Steve grabs his
equipment. They start walking.</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: He’ll probably fire you after.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Any luck, the storm will kill me first.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Shhhh.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What? I didn’t -</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Shhhh. He puts his hands on the sides of her
head. Mary’s confused and a bit freaked out.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: In here. So loud. Always thinking, thinking,
thinking. Mary goes to speak, stops herself. Clyde keeps his hands still
on her head, looks into her eyes.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: You already found what you’re looking for.
Mary’s eyes soften and she’s suddenly calm. A moment of peace. Suddenly,
Mary spots Hartman, Steve and Angus rush past. She breaks away from
Clyde, rushes along the fence to catch up.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Wait! Steve! Hartman spots her.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Sorry, darling, we’re on to the next
story.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: No, wait! Attendee! She runs to the end of the
fence, jumps it, runs after them.</p>
<p><strong>steve! steve!</strong>: Angus and Hartman load up the truck
as Steve turns back to Mary, seething.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Considering you probably just cost me my job,
maybe you don’t want to talk to me right now.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: But I do! If you’re in trouble because of me I
can fix it, I can explain to your boss. He or she probably just doesn’t
understand our relationship.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: We don’t have a relationship.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Sure we do, it’s just in the pupa stage right
now.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Mary, go home! She looks at him, hurt.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Go home. He jumps in the CNN truck as Angus
starts it up. Mary looks around, helpless.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Six letter word for “over my lifeless,
rigormortic and maggot infested, i.e. dead, body am I giving up now”…
D-O-G-G- motherfucking-E-D. Dogged. She gets out her Chapstick,
liberally applies it, dabs a bit on her temples as well.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Normally I don’t condone swearing. I think
it’s something people do when they don’t have the vocabulary to express
themselves properly, but even I, with my plenitudinous vocab, must admit
– every once in a while, it’s okay to get a bit peppery -</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I got him in trouble, Dad. I have to go find
him and make it right. There’s three places they could be headed. She
pulls a note pad out of her pocket, looks it over.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: For each story, I’ve worked out an equation of
potential human casualties, estimated property damage, availability of
endlessly repeatable images, with bonus points for anything involving
reporters in galoshes. There’s no doubt in my mind. They’re heading to
the storm in Galveston.</p>
<p><strong>mr. horowitz</strong>: Enough is enough. You’ve got to get
home, turn in your crossword for next week -</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I can’t think of work at a time like this!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. horowitz</strong>: You can’t chase that boy any more. If
he doesn’t appreciate you it’s ridiculous to -</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Ridiculous? Mom! How many times did you
propose to dad?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. horowitz mr. horowitz</strong>: Twice. Seven times.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I rest my case! If you gave up the first time
dad said no then I wouldn’t exist. Telling me to give up so soon on my
potential husband- to-be, birth father of my twelve future children and
adoptive father of my gerbil Carol – you might as well be saying that
you wish you had given up too and that you never married dad and that
I’d never been born. Is that what you’re saying?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. horowitz</strong>: Give Steve my best.</p>
<p><strong>mr. horowitz</strong>: Be careful.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. horowitz</strong>: And eat! A biscuit, anything. A V8
wouldn’t kill you.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Sure you don’t want to come along?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I wish, but I only left enough cat food
out for two days. I’ll miss you guys! Elizabeth hugs them both, jumps on
the bus. Howard and Mary watch as she struggles to her seat with all the
signs.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: This storm could be bad. Sure you want to
drive into it?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: How bad could it be?</p>
<p><strong>tnt. cnn atlanta - night</strong>: The CNN METEOROLOGIST
points at the map, images swirling around the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p><strong>cnn meteorologist</strong>: Hurricane Lorraine, currently
rated category four, expected to hit landfall by tomorrow evening.
Making the situation even more frightening, that area of Texas currently
in the midst of its worst tornado season in history. Tornado images
appear on the map.</p>
<p><strong>cnn meteorologist</strong>: And here’s where it gets
interesting. A black swarm graphic appears as well.</p>
<p><strong>cnn meteorologist</strong>: Add the looming cicada migration
to the mix and no one knows just how devastating this storm could
be.</p>
<p><strong>weather channel meteorologist</strong>: Category four
hurricane, an F-3 or “severe” tornado, billions upon billions of cicadas
– collectively now being termed a “category fifteen winged
tornadocane”.</p>
<p><strong>ktft meteorologist</strong>: Tornadocane.</p>
<p><strong>kprc anchor</strong>: Tornadocane.</p>
<p><strong>klug meteorologist</strong>: God really hates us now.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: And this time, the warnings were hard to
ignore. One Galvestonian told us “tornados, we can handle. Hurricanes we
can handle. Bugs we can handle. Put ’em all together and that’s a storm
I don’t need to see”. A wise man indeed. Something off to the side
catches Hartman’s eye – it’s a picnic table blowing down the street.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Oooh! Get that! Steve gets the shot then
pretends to make adjustments to his camera while he discretely scans the
area, on the lookout for Mary.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: And when I met Steve, I knew right away we had
a lot in common. We’re both in the media, we both love crosswords, we
both love words. We both felt this unexplainable connection, no matter
how much his instinct might be to fight it. That’s okay. We just have to
get to know each other better, that’s all. She uses the wipe on her
face, gets a bit on her lip and the taste is awful. She rolls down the
window, closes her eyes and gently sticks her face out to rinse with
rain water. The car hits a flooded patch of the road. A wave of mud
washes up and smacks Mary right in the face.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Crap. She starts the handy wipe bath all over
again. A nervous Howard speaks up.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: I saw Steve talking to you… He wasn’t very
nice. Mary makes herself busy putting the handy wipe in her Kroger bag
then looks out the window.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: If there’s one thing I learned from crossword
puzzles it’s that you can’t give up.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I have to give it one more try. I have to fix
the mess I made with his work, then maybe he and I – For the first time,
she doesn’t seem so sure. Howard notices.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: You know what my favorite part of doing
crosswords is? When you know something you didn’t think you knew. Mary
thinks about it, then turns back to looking out the window.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Me too.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Paula, this pier was closed to the public
twenty-four hours ago, and for good reason. Steve inches a bit closer
for the shot, his footing unstable. Josh moves in and hangs on to Steve
to keep him steady.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: As I stand here, I can actually feel the
structure moving under my feet. The only thing between me and the
limitless depths of the sea is this two-by-four railing that - The
railing flies off. Hartman drops to his knees and crawls to the other
railing then hangs on for dear life. Steve and Josh struggle to hang on
to the camera and each other.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: And Paula I have to tell you, not only has
my hearing been permanently damaged by the sheer force of the rain
hitting my eardrums, but at this point, I’m beginning to wonder if I’ll
even make it out alive. He raises his head up for the big finish, gets
hammered by the wind and rain.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: This is Hartman Hughes, reporting live from
Galveston, Texas. Steve and Josh start backing up off the pier with
Hartman crawling behind them. Steve yells back to him.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You had to get the pier shot. Had to. Just
about got us all killed. Happy? Hartman points in the water, yells.</p>
<p><strong>oh my god! it’s mary!</strong>: Steve jumps, looks to where
Hartman is pointing – it’s a plastic bag floating by in the water.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You’re such an asshole. Steve walks off the
pier mad as hell.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Come on, that was funny. You have to admit…
Stevie?</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Hang on. He hits the brakes, starts backing
up as quickly as possible. Mary looks ahead – sees what looks like a
tornado up ahead.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Oh my God. Howard backs under an overpass,
points to a protected area up the cement embankment.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: We’ll just have to wait for this to pass,
then we’ll keep going. It’ll be okay. They look down to the road just in
time to see Howard’s car picked up and blown right through the
underpass, landing on its side in a ditch fifty yards away.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Crap!</p>
<p><strong>mr. horowitz</strong>: She’s fine. She’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. horowitz</strong>: This is all your fault.</p>
<p><strong>mr. horowitz</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>girl’s voice</strong>: Steve… Oh Steve… Steve awakens in
panic.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Who the hell are you? What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>mexican boy</strong>: They pay me twenty dollar to wake you.
Steve looks outside the van, sees Doug and Hartman laughing hard. The
Kid scurries out of the van. Angus gets in, opens up his laptop.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You seen her?</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: She’s too smart to come here during this.
Steve looks around like he’s crazy.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: No, she’s here somewhere. I can feel it.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I spy with my little eye a chemical element
from group two of the periodic table.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Barium… I spy with my little</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Cobalt. Mary points to a steel belted tire on
the ground, lays back and shuts her eyes. Howard takes something out of
his - it’s a pocket, puts it in her hand. Mary looks at it shrivelled,
sculpted apple head. She smiles, hardly able to keep her eyes open.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Mother Teresa.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: My best seller. I’m an apple sculptor. She’s
quiet for once. Howard watches her drift off.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: I went to school for physics but got bored.
Now I just make these and sell them on appleheadsrule.com. I was going
to give that one to my girlfriend in Bangor but I can make her another
one. She’d probably prefer a Stephen Hawking one anyway. Science is her
life. Not like my girlfriend in Tacoma. She’s really into Jesus. Same as
my other girlfriend in Duluth. He waits for a response - nothing.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Maybe I’ll meet them in person one day.
They’re just so far away and I don’t get out much, not farther than the
apple orchard or the post office anyway.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: But you’re out now. He’s a bit surprised she
was listening.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: I saw the people on TV fighting for Baby
Peggy. It wasn’t far from my house, and the people there looked nice
enough, so I went. I thought I had everything I needed at home but then
I thought, maybe there’s more.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Maybe there is.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Can I tell you something? Mary nods.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: I like your eyeballs.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: They’re fuscous, that means -</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Brownish gray. I know. They both smile.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You know what I’d call this?</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Quagmire?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Imbroglio, Howard. That means we’re
screwed.</p>
<p><strong>corbitt</strong>: Storm’s over. What else is happening? The
Exec shrugs and yawns.</p>
<p><strong>businessman</strong>: Sloooowww news day.</p>
<p><strong>first reporter</strong>: Fire, a car chase, anything?</p>
<p><strong>second reporter</strong>: There is nothing going on, man.
Nada.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Who’s ready for some fun? The deaf kids
start running down the hill, straight for the petting zoo.</p>
<p><strong>cnn anchor</strong>: An abandoned mine shaft on the outskirts
of Eunice, Louisiana. The children, apparently all hearing impaired,
enjoying a trip’ to the county fair, blissfully unaware of the danger
that lay ahead.</p>
<p><strong>fox news anchor</strong>: No word yet on injuries. No word on
when, or if, rescuers will be able to reach the special needs children.
Well continue to bring you news as this tragic story unfolds.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Tornadocane my ass. Where the hell were the
cicadas? Retards in a mine shaft, now that’s a story.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: They’re deaf, asshole. They spot Mary and
Howard up ahead in the ditch, next to the car on its side.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Look, it’s your girlfriend.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: We’re not stopping. Hartman grabs a piece of
paper, writes fast.</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: We can’t just leave them.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Highway patrol’s down here every hour. It’s
not like they’ll rot in the ditch. As they get closer, Hartman rolls
down his window, folds up the piece of paper.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: What the hell are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Getting some fresh air. It helps my pores.
Steve tries to grab the paper.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Hughes!</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Yes, Steven?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You’re not telling her where we’re going.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Aren’t I?</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: Christ, you two. You’ll get us killed. Angus
leans into the front seat, tries to steady the steering wheel.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Asshole! Hartman laughs, rubs his arm in
pain.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: “Eunice, Louisiana. Please…” She stops
reading, looks a bit uneasy. Howard steps forward, grabs the note.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: “Please meet…” He looks at Mary, disgusted,
continues reading.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: M-E-A-T. “Please meat me there. XO
Steve”.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: See? He needs me, if only to help with his
spelling.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: No kidding. She rushes to the car, Howard
joins her. They push the car ey with everything they have, it tips back
onto its wheels. Th jump in the car and start it up.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: And what went through your mind when you
realized they were gone? The Teacher just bawls. Hartman turns to the
camera.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Grief too strong for words. That’s the best
way to describe this tragic, tragic scene. One minute, a merry day at
the fair. The next minute, helpless babes savagely sucked into the
menacing abyss. The Teacher bawls even harder. Hartman gives her a
“there there” then continues talking to camera.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: And here’s how hopeless the rescue looks at
this moment. The earth surrounding hole is far too perilous for anybody
to approach on foot. Moving heavy rescue equipment in too close could
mean death for the rescuers as well. Its cold down there, wet, dark,
probably a few snakes and rats moving around.</p>
<p>****: I don’t know what the hell happened but I smell a lawsuit.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: To some, a simple crane. To the trapped,
innocent, special children – the answer to their prayers. The cable
lowering the bucket jerks and stops. The crowd gasps. Hartman stays on
camera.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Or is it? The cable jerks and begins moving
again.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Only time will tell. Through the crowd,
Steve sees a WOMAN who looks like Mary from the back. fie freezes, then
realizes it’s not her. Total relief.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Please let those kids be okay.</p>
<p><strong>rescuer</strong>: Hey! Buddy! Back it up. Steve backs up,
refocuses on the hole as the cable rises. - it’s one of the Kids
Finally, a smiling little face appears being carried up by the
Fireman.</p>
<p><strong>fireman</strong>: They’re all okay! The rescuers cheer. The
Teachers bawl.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Elation here in Louisiana but the danger,
far from over as rescuers bring these children up one grubby little face
at a time. Hartman looks off to the side, holds up a finger like he’s
trying not to cry. He signals Steve to cut.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Remind me next time to mention Jesus. Still
on the lookout for Mary, Steve’s not even listening.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: George, Lydia! What’s going on? Lydia hugs
her.</p>
<p><strong>protestor wife / lydia</strong>: They got eleven out. All
fine, thank God. More coming up.</p>
<p><strong>fireman</strong>: That’s the last of them! As he hands the
kid to safety, the cable jerks. He gets out of the basket just in time
before the whole thing - basket and cable – snaps off and drops into the
hole.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: A happy ending that’s left parents across
this country wondering - how can I keep my family safe from abandoned
mines? Are there abandoned mines in my backyard? Is my child’s school
built on top of an abandoned mine? Steve spots Mary, running toward
him.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: No, no, no.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: And how, oh how, can these death traps be
avoided? Mary drops right into the abandoned mine.</p>
<p><strong>cnn anchor</strong>: Mary Horowitz. A painful high school
photo of Mary appears on the screen. Bad hair, bad make-up, ridiculously
large smile, unfortunate frilly chemise.</p>
<p><strong>news anchor</strong>: Mary Horowitz.</p>
<p><strong>another news anchor</strong>: Mary Horowitz.</p>
<p><strong>corbitt</strong>: Shame about your girlfriend in the pit,
Steve, but we’ve got the inside advantage here so let’s use it. Steve
shakes his head, not impressed. Angus takes the phone off speaker, steps
aside to talk to Corbitt. Steve’s phone rings. He answers it, listens,
cringes.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Mrs. Horowitz.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. horowitz</strong>: We’re coming! Tell her to hang on!
Mr. Horowitz runs down the stairs with luggage and Carol the gerbil.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You and your husband stay put,
Mrs. Horowitz.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: She better be. Hartman looks away,
guilty.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Eight letter word for… my life has come to
this. There’s a bit of shuffling around in the dark.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Not destiny, that’s only seven letters. Not
fortuity - that sounds more like when good things happen to people like
finding a quarter in the sofa or something. I mean the not so great
stuff that’s bound to befall some people more than others. Fate’s nasty
cousin, I mean. Suddenly Mary’s face lights up with her mini keychain
flashlight.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: F-O-R-E-D-0-0-M. Foredoom.</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: Mary shines the light on her knee. Her previous
cut is now gaping wound, blood is all over the place.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Crap.</p>
<p><strong>rescue supervisor</strong>: The new equipment is going to
take a while. Let’s try and find out what kind of shape our victim’s
in.</p>
<p><strong>rescuer</strong>: Can we lower a phone down in there?</p>
<p><strong>mine safety expert</strong>: Not at those depths, this whole
area is bad enough above ground. We’ll never get a signal down
there.</p>
<p><strong>rescue supervisor</strong>: Let’s keep it simple. Get me a
flashlight, a piece of paper and a pencil. An unenthusiastic Hartman
steps in front of the camera, the Rescuers in the shot behind him. Doug
films. Hartman goes to speak but can’t seem to summon his on air
personality.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Behind inc… Oh what’s the point? Hartman
walks away moping.</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: Corbitt wants you to go on air to talk about
Mary. An interview with the boyfriend.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I’m not her boyfriend!</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: Close enough. Come on, we need this. Hartman
steps up, listens in.</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: Fox has already got their hands on everything
but her panty size.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Fox scooped us? Our Mary? The bastards.
Steve glares at him.</p>
<p><strong>retired mine supervisor</strong>: That area was never
reinforced up above, no need since the whole eastern tunnel was blocked
off in the late Seventies. Of course that would also affect the air
quality down there.</p>
<p><strong>anchor</strong>: That has to be bad news for Mary Horowitz,
wouldn’t you say?</p>
<p><strong>retired mine supervisor</strong>: Definitely not looking
good.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. horowitz</strong>: Who are these people?</p>
<p><strong>slick journalist</strong>: Mary Horowitz, described by those
who know her as smart, talkative, very much the girl next door, that is,
if the girl next door has a genius level IQ. She’s worked for eleven
years as the crossword constructor for the Atlanta Citizen and lives
right here with her parents. Mr. Horowitz opens the door an is swarmed
by Reporters. The Slick Journalist gets right in there.</p>
<p><strong>mr. horowitz</strong>: No, Mary doesn’t live with us. She
just came over one day and won’t leave, but she has her own place.</p>
<p><strong>slick journalist</strong>: Can you comment on the rumors that
Mary’s fall into the mine was a suicide attempt?</p>
<p><strong>mr. horowitz</strong>: That’s ridiculous. Not our Mary. The
word depression isn’t in her vocabulary. Well, it’s in her vocabulary,
obviously, but no, nothing ever gets her down. Steady as a rock, that
one.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I am not afraid. I am not fearful,
pusillanimous, nor am I affrighted. Suddenly in the light - a face. Mary
screams her head off. The face doesn’t budge - it’s a LITTLE DEAF
GIRL.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Oh my God, they forgot one! You scared the
crap out of me. The girl just stares at her.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’m sorry, can you hear me, I mean at all? Do
you have sensorineural hearing loss or conductive? “Deaf people can do
anything except hear.” You know who said that? Doctor Jordan, first deaf
President of Gallaudet U. Maybe you’ll go there one day. That is, unless
we perish down here. Mary smiles. The Little Deaf Girl just stares
back.</p>
<p><strong>young rescuer</strong>: What should we say?</p>
<p><strong>rescue supervisor</strong>: Tell her help is on the way. We
just need her to confirm she’s conscious – here, give me that. The
Supervisor grabs the paper and pencil, scribbles the note, ties it to
the flashlight. They look up to the thin nylon rope now in place of the
snapped cable. The Rescue Supervisor signals for them to drop it. He
attaches the flashlight/note, waves to the crane op. The crane swings
over, lowers the rope into the hole.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: And then there’s black lung disease, also a
problem in coal mines. Chronic cough, breathlessness, cyanosis - that’s
where your skin turns purple – There’s a CLINK behind Mary. She turns
her light onto the area, sees the flashlight and note hanging from the
thin rope. Mary grabs the flashlight, turns it on, reads the note.</p>
<p><strong>rescue supervisor</strong>: That’s a good sign right there.
The Young Rescuer grabs the note.</p>
<p><strong>rescue supervisor</strong>: What’s it say?</p>
<p><strong>unfolds</strong>: The rescue team gathers around. The Young
Rescuer the note, reads it slowly and loudly.</p>
<p><strong>young rescuer</strong>: “I think you mean, am i conscious,
not am I conscience.”</p>
<p><strong>rescue supervisor</strong>: Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>young rescuer</strong>: “Conscious means alert and awake.
Conscience is your inner morality gauge, you know, the thing that stops
you from doing bad things, e.g. killing, stealing, harming helpless
animals, and whatnot.”</p>
<p><strong>rescue supervisor</strong>: Can we leave her down there? He
motions for the Rescuer to continue.</p>
<p><strong>young rescuer</strong>: “To answer your question, yes I am
conscious. My leg is bleeding but I’ll probably live.”</p>
<p><strong>rescue supervisor</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>young rescuer</strong>: “Yours truly, Mary Horowitz.” The
other rescuers start to disperse.</p>
<p><strong>rescuer</strong>: “P.S. Did anybody lose a little deaf
girl?”</p>
<p><strong>rescuer</strong>: “I found one. She’s fine… Other than not
being able to hear, I mean.”</p>
<p><strong>fox news anchor</strong>: Breaking news from Louisiana, we’ve
just received word that abandoned mine victim Mary Horowitz is
alive.</p>
<p><strong>tnt. horowitz house - day</strong>: Mr. and Mrs. Horowitz
watch the “Alive!” news coverage. Mrs. Horowitz cries. Mr. Horowitz
comforts her.</p>
<p><strong>tnt. fox news desk – day</strong>: The mine coverage
continues.</p>
<p><strong>fox news anchor</strong>: Also in the mine, a hearing
impaired child overlooked in the earlier rescue. Speculation now as to
whether or not Mary Horowitz intentionally heaved herself into the mine
to save the child after rescuers ignored her pleas.</p>
<p><strong>nancy grace</strong>: They missed a child? They missed a
child? Can’t these people count? Thank goodness for this woman, this
Mary Horowitz - let’s bring up that picture of her again. The picture of
Mary appears on the monitor.</p>
<p><strong>nancy grace</strong>: We’re looking at an American hero,
folks. It it wasn’t for Mary Horowitz, the child would have never been
found.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Thank Christ. Now if they can only get her
out of there. Angus hangs up his phone.</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: Corbitt wants you on in five. Steve sees he
has no choice. He nods. Hartman puts an arm around him.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: I’ll be gentle.</p>
<p><strong>rescue supervisor</strong>: We’ve got the whole country
watching now, can’t afford any more mistakes. The crane from Shreveport
is a wash. We’re looking at as much as sixteen hours to bring the other
one in.</p>
<p><strong>mine safety expert</strong>: Sixteen hours? If we’ve got
carbon monoxide -</p>
<p><strong>rescue supervisor</strong>: There’s air coming in through the
top.</p>
<p><strong>mine safety expert</strong>: Even at a concentration of 5ppm,
they could suffocate… We do not have sixteen hours.</p>
<p><strong>rescue supervisor</strong>: Let’s at least get some food and
water down there. The rope we’ve got on there now will handle a small
load – if that damn crane holds. He looks up at the old crane,
worried.</p>
<p><strong>mine safety expert</strong>: Gas masks, oxygen supply, how
long? The Rescue Supervisor points around the area - look where we
are.</p>
<p><strong>rescue supervisor</strong>: As fast as we can get them
here.</p>
<p><strong>mine safety expert</strong>: Might not be soon enough.</p>
<p><strong>retired mine supervisor</strong>: They’re pretty much
done.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Howard! She hugs him.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: She’ll be okay. She will. Howard looks
behind him at the ever growing crowd.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: All this. For her. He manages a sad
smile.</p>
<p><strong>fox news anchor</strong>: The question on everybody’s mind
tonight is, who is Mary Horowitz? Atlanta affiliate WAGA looks into the
mind of an everyday hero. WAGA Reporter CINDY emotes like her life
depends on it.</p>
<p><strong>waga cindy</strong>: No one will argue that the city of
Atlanta has always been a breeding ground for heroes. Jimmy Carter, Hank
Aaron, Ryan Seacrest and now… Mary Horowitz. As the country wonders
about what would drive this woman to such an extraordinary act, we went
straight to those closest to her.</p>
<p><strong>nervous old lady</strong>: Mary Horowitz was one of my second
grade students. Brilliant girl… Darling. Always a smart dresser as I
remember. And she once brought me soup when I wasn’t well.</p>
<p><strong>waga cindy</strong>: Mary Horowitz, a hero who’s devoted her
life to caring for the sick and elderly. Clearly a woman with a higher
purpose.</p>
<p><strong>female reporter</strong>: Exactly like the boots worn by Mary
Horowitz when she slipped into the mine. Were the boots responsible for
the accident? The manufacturer refuses to comment. For now, the deadly
footwear remains on store shelves, leaving consumers to pay the ultimate
price.</p>
<p><strong>states”.</strong>: banner underneath reads “NOW BANNED IN
4</p>
<p><strong>fourteen year old girl</strong>: Oh my God, we so have to
have them!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Rhinolith, that’s the real word. Rhino is
nose, lithos means stone. Nose stone. You know what that is? Snot.</p>
<p><strong>scientist</strong>: I knew Mary Horowitz in college. She
caught me trying to cheat off her physics midterm, lectured me for an
hour and when she finally stopped talking I asked her out. She said no,
said it was because I was, get this - hebetudinous. Can you believe? He
walks away, bitter, gets back to work on NASA rockets.</p>
<p><strong>researcher</strong>: We dated for a while but she ended it.
Said she couldn’t stand this - He points around ’to the library - you
could hear a pin drop.</p>
<p><strong>researcher</strong>: Whatever that means.</p>
<p><strong>waga cindy</strong>: A heartbreaker, leaving behind a trail
of devastation.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: And Archimedes, there’s another one. He was
into math, philosophy, all kinds of stuff, then one day he was working
out an equation in the sand and somebody stabbed him. Crappy, I
know.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: Steve, tell us about Mary, your fiance
struggling for her life at the bottom of the abandoned mine as we speak.
Steve glares at him. Hartman motions for him to go on.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Mary… she’s smart, incredibly smart. She
talks a lot. Never boring, I’ll tell you that much. He thinks about her,
gets lost in it.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Mary Horowitz doesn’t pretend to be anything
she’s not. She’s passionate, beautiful, real… and she definitely doesn’t
deserve to be where she is now.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: They don’t even know her.</p>
<p><strong>elderly lady</strong>: No, but they know what it’s like to be
alone, to need a helping hand. That’s a good enough reason to be
here.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Happenstance, I love that word too. And you
know what else - Mary coughs. Before she has a chance to catch her
breath, a rope with a small bag attached quickly drops next to her, the
bag hitting the floor. Mary unties the bag and looks inside to find
water and sandwiches.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: No dessert. Crappy. Did you know that the word
dessert comes from an old French word that means “clear the table”?
Sometimes I feel like dinner is just doing time so I can get to the
point, and of course the point always involves sugar. Who needs - The
Little Deaf Girl covers her ears, vocalizes as much as she’s able.</p>
<p><strong>little deaf girl</strong>: Shut up! I can’t hear you but you
talk a lot. Totally catches Mary off guard. She fully takes that in. Her
demeanor completely shifts, a calm washes over her.,</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I know. She sits down.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I know. She notices the Little Girl’s shoes
are soaked. Mary moves next to her, takes off her rubber boots and puts
them on the Little Girl. Mary puts an arm around her, holds her close at
- softly, her side, then speaks like she’s a different person to
herself, the Little Girl unable to read her lips.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’m not good at… silence. “Mary doesn’t do
quiet”, that’s how my grandmother always said it. “What’s that hush?”
she’d holler at a party. “It’s Mary about to talk”, then she’d laugh and
laugh and laugh. Everybody would… But I knew something they didn’t -
that if you keep talking, if you keep on talking, you don’t hear people
telling you that you’re different. You don’t hear people saying they
don’t like you. And if you’re talking, you just might not hear it when
some kid… calls you a freak. Mary’s eyes start to well.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I just wanted to be normal, that’s all. Steve
said I was. She thinks about it, laughs a bit.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’m beginning to think newsmen can’t entirely
be trusted. She buttons up the Little Girl’s sweater.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: The truth is normal is – not me. She seems
surprised she said it out loud. There’s relief in it.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: My friends, the people I’ve met over the past
week, they’re not normal either. They’re more interesting, more
original, more real, more rare. She suddenly gets it, brightens up.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: That’s where I fit. - and for She thinks about
it, in silence. The sadness fades the first time, she’s comfortably
quiet. She smiles at the Little Deaf Girl. The Little Deaf Girl smiles
back. And they sit – Mary totally calm. Mary hears something in the
distance - a gentle PLINK PLINK PLINK she couldn’t have heard while
talking. She picks up the flashlight, moves toward the noise. In a
corner of the mine, a water drip hits on some old rusted mining tools,
including two rusty vice grips. The Little Girl coughs. Mary looks back
at her, concerned.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Little Deaf Girl, it’s time for us to go
home.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: What’s taking so long?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. horowitz</strong>: Why aren’t they doing anything?
Mr. Horowitz grabs her hand.</p>
<p><strong>cnn anchor</strong>: A tense night in Eunice, Louisiana.
Hartman what can you tell us?</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: They’ve lowered food and water into the
depths of this abandoned mine. The last task of this archaic crane that
finally blew its motor. We’ve been told the new rescue equipment won’t
make it until daybreak. Until then, all we can do is wait, hope, and of
course pray. There’s a commotion at the rescue site. Doug zooms in.</p>
<p><strong>at the hole:</strong>: The rope hanging into the hole is
moving. Rescuers get as close to the hole as possible.</p>
<p><strong>rescue supervisor</strong>: Jesus Christ. Tell me she’s not
-</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: After I got kicked out of Girl Scouts, while
the other girls were learning how to sell cookies, I was at home reading
the biography of Sir Edmund Hillary. Mary motions for the Little Deaf
Girl to jump on piggyback. She jumps up onto Mary’s back, still in the
red rubber boots. Mary starts jugging up the rope, the vice grips and
rope pieces acting like ladder steps. They start rising up slowly. Not
an easy task. Mary struggles every step.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: If life is like a crossword puzzle then its
worth, its greatness, its raison d’efre should be judged in the same
way.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Is it solvable? One of the red boots drops
down into the mine shaft.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Is it entertaining?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Does it sparkle? The crowd goes nuts. Cameras
flash. Rescuers rush to help them onto the ground. An Ambulance
Attendant grabs the little Girl, wraps her in a blanket. Mary’s eyes
flutter in the blinding lights of the cameras pointed at her. She scans
the entire crowd.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: And does it fit? Her eyes fix on a spot in the
crowd. She starts running.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Good for her. Good for her.</p>
<p><strong>jim soloman</strong>: We’re going to have to give her her job
back. He shakes his head, laughs.</p>
<p><strong>large kid</strong>: Did you start this and not bother
finishing it? Do you know how much work goes into making these things?
Honestly, Dad. The Kid grabs a pencil to finish the puzzle.</p>
<p><strong>hartman</strong>: First interview is ours. Here comes our
girl. Steve, you ready? Grab her arid kiss her then let me start with
the questions. Doug focuses in on Steve. Hartman holds the crowd back so
Mary can get to him. Mary runs toward them – and keeps on running, right
past Steve’s open arms. She heads for her friends at the fence - Howard,
Elizabeth, Carlos, George, Lydia, all of the other Protestors. She swan
dives right into them. They catch her.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: You’re okay.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I am. Cameras go off all around them.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: My brain is full of all kinds of information,
some of it useful, some of it not.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: In solving the puzzle of life there’s one
thing you must do. She points to the side of the road. The bus pulls
over.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Find somebody just as normal as you. Mary
stands up, gets off the bus.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: if not a whole bunch. Howard, Elizabeth,
George, Lydia, Carlos, Clyde, a few old Ladies, a bunch of other
Protestors file off the bus. Mary keeps talking to the bus driver.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: And don’t be a slave to your loins. Trust me
on that one. Mary taps the side of her head.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You need to let this be the boss of you.
Cornprende ?</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: That bus driver looked like Francis Galton.
Did you see that?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: He’s my favorite behavioral geneticist in the
world. They continue on through an open yard.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: In retrospect, and I say this with some
hesitation because I don’t like to have actual regrets so I’ll just say
I’m beginning to perpend -</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Good one.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: I’m beginning to perpend whether or not
eating three bags of caramel corn for lunch was the smartest thing to
do. Honestly I’m this close to spewing… Mary reaches the end of the path
and stops, waits for everybody else to catch up. They’re in complete awe
of the monstrous Georgian estate before them.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: My grandma left it to me. My parents won’t
stay here. And for me it was always too… quiet. She looks at her new
friends.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Not anymore. They head toward the house.</p>
