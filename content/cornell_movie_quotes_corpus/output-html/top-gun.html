<p><strong>note</strong>: Aerial dialogue in CAPS is UHF radio; plane to
plane, plane to carrier.</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: Closing fast. MUSTANG, THIS IS</p>
<p><strong>cougar</strong>: Look for the trailer.</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: I don’t see anything. MAVERICK,</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: I’ve got a six strobe. I think he’s locked on
us.</p>
<p><strong>cougar</strong>: It’s a MiG 21. They don’t have radar
missiles!</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: Let’s hope you’re right!</p>
<p><strong>cougar</strong>: What is he doing?</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: He’s pissing me off!</p>
<p><strong>cougar</strong>: Can’t shake him.</p>
<p><strong>cougar</strong>: Maintaining course. Straight for
Mustang.</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: Stay with him.</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: That’s missile lock!</p>
<p><strong>cougar</strong>: He better be kidding!</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: Lordy! Eyeball to Asshole. Hope nobody
burps!</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: I’LL LOCK ON THEM, COUGAR. Gotcha covered,
don’t nobody move.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: ROGER, COUGAR. Okay boys, pull out with
your hands up and nobody’ll get hurt.</p>
<p><strong>cougar</strong>: We’re locked on MiG ONE. Why doesn’t he
disengage?</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: These guys are getting on my nerves.</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: He’s running for it.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Ah, the thrill of victory and the agony of
defeat.</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: Speaking of feet, fuel’s down to 4.0. We’re
gonna get them wet unless we find a Sonoco station.</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: Hey, if it was easy, everybody would want to
come up here and do it….. Instead of just us.</p>
<p><strong>cougar</strong>: You.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Call the ball? I don’t see the ship!</p>
<p><strong>cougar</strong>: Help me with this one, I’m really screwed
up.</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: Bring it left. Bring it left, You’re
high.</p>
<p><strong>cougar</strong>: This is crazy!</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: What is?</p>
<p><strong>cougar</strong>: Wait! Hell!..Something’s wrong!</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: What? What is it?</p>
<p><strong>cougar</strong>: Were upside down!</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: You’re crazy. We’re level.</p>
<p><strong>cougar</strong>: Can’t you feel it? I’m hanging in my
straps!</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: You’re not. We’re level. Look at the
instruments, we’re okay!</p>
<p><strong>cougar</strong>: They must be broken. I’m hanging in my
straps! We’re inverted!</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: We’re not! Trust me! We’re okay.</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: What the hell you doing?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Helping him in.</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: What makes you think we can get back in? We
don’t have the fuel for this.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Just get me to him.</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: He’s nine o’clock high. We’re two thousand
pounds low!</p>
<p><strong>cougar</strong>: I’m pulling up.</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: No! Now we’re inverted!</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: We’re on vapor, Cougar, you got to put it
down.</p>
<p><strong>cougar</strong>: It’s crazy, man. Instruments are crazy.
We’re gonna have to eject.</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: Look at the weather! They’ll never find us!
We’re near out of fuel. Put it down.</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: You’ll have mine, Cougar. It’ll be where your
head used to be.</p>
<p><strong>silver suit</strong>: Goose, can you hear me? Goose!</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: Oh, Hello… Valet parking?</p>
<p><strong>silver suit</strong>: Son of a bitch!</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: You will put it up front, with the
Porsches?</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: Hey…easy…Take it easy… I’m a veteran!</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: Can you check under the hood. I thought I
heard a funny noise.</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: Lucy…Ricky…I’n Home!</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: Is it extra for the hot wax?</p>
<p><strong>air boss</strong>: Clear the flight deck.</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: Well…there goes your tip.</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: It’s Goose. He’s alright. Bring it
left…You’re settling. IS THE</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: On behalf of your Captain and your crew, I
want to thank you for flying VF101. And next time your plans include the
middle of the goddamn ocean in the dead of frigging night, I hope you’ll
think of Naval Aviation.</p>
<p><strong>surgeon</strong>: Stress reaction…</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: Never mind my head, check my shorts!</p>
<p><strong>stinger</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>stinger</strong>: Cougar, what is it? You should be in sick
bay. What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>cougar</strong>: Thinking of my wife and kid.</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: Cougar!</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Cougar? STINGER Maverick, Goose…Come in
here.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: Don’t worry. I’ll talk to him.</p>
<p><strong>stinger</strong>: Don’t.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: He’s a good pilot.</p>
<p><strong>stinger</strong>: I talked a man back once. Three months
later, we lost him. It’s his decision. Only he knows.</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: He’s the best you have. He’s going Top
Gun!</p>
<p><strong>stinger</strong>: Was.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>stinger</strong>: Was going. Now you are.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>stinger</strong>: Well, he’s going and he needs someone to
fly the plane.</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: Skipper, you can’t do this!</p>
<p><strong>stinger</strong>: I didn’t do it, he did it himself.
Something about a wife and kid. The fact is, he’s lost it. He knows it.
I know it. You were up there, you know it, too.</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: Give him a break, Skipper. It was raining
snakes up there. He’ll be alright, soon as all the gorillas go home…</p>
<p><strong>stinger</strong>: I know some RIOS are a little wiggy…but you
abuse the priviledge! I don’t believe I’m going to have to put the two
of you in the same cockpit…but there it is! It may be good for the Navy.
It might be good for you, but most of all, it’s good for me. It’ll get
you out of my sight.</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: But, Skipper, Cougar’s been picked for Top
Gun…He’s the best of the best!</p>
<p><strong>stinger</strong>: Well, you’ll just have to make do with him
.</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: Mav’s a great flyer but….</p>
<p><strong>stinger</strong>: He’s a hell of a flyer. In fact, he’s so
damn good he might have been picked for Top Gun himself. Except for one
thing. He just can’t seem to follow orders!</p>
<p><strong>stinger</strong>: You just did an incredibly brave thing!
What you should have done was land your plane. You don’t own that plane,
the taxpayers do. I should ream you out for it. But it just doesn’t work
with you. You’re a hell of a flyer. You are maybe …too good. You never
really stepped in it yet. So this is your chance. I’m gonna send you up
against the best. They are better than you. Maybe they’ll knock that
shine off your eagle and you’ll see, finally, where discipline and
teamwork fit it. Maverick hasn’t really heard anything but TOPGUN. He
snaps out of it.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>stinger</strong>: That is all. Tell me about the MiG some
other time…</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Yes sir!</p>
<p><strong>stinger</strong>: Maverick..</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Yes sir..</p>
<p><strong>stinger</strong>: The wings..</p>
<p><strong>stinger</strong>: Gentlemen!</p>
<p><strong>maverick/goose</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>stinger</strong>: Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>chp</strong>: Son. Do you know why I stopped you?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Yes sir. I do sir</p>
<p><strong>chp</strong>: Well… What is it?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Sir. You are going to give me a warning,
Sir!</p>
<p><strong>chp</strong>: License and registration.</p>
<p><strong>chp</strong>: Lieutenant, do you know how fast you were
going?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Yes sir. I do, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>chp</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Sir. I was going Mach point one five.</p>
<p><strong>chp</strong>: One SIXTH the speed of sound!</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>chp</strong>: Lieutenant… What do you… usually fly?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: F-14’s sir.</p>
<p><strong>chp</strong>: Tomcats?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Yes sir!</p>
<p><strong>chp</strong>: Lieutenant… Is there… a Russian attack?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: No sir! But you have to be ready.</p>
<p><strong>chp</strong>: Lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Yes, Sergeant?</p>
<p><strong>chp</strong>: Remember one thing.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>chp</strong>: Outside of this gate… I…am Top Gun.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Yes sir!</p>
<p><strong>ice</strong>: Uh oh, police escort. This one must be a real
killer.</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: During the Korean War, the Navy kill ratio
was twelve-to-one. We shot down twelve of their jets for every one of
ours. In Vietnam, this ratio fell to three-to-one. Our pilots depended
on missles. They lost their dogfighting skills.</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: Top Gun was created to teach ACM. Air Combat
Maneuvering…Dogfighting. Richthofen, Guynemer, Rickenbacker, Galland,
Rudel, Bong would envy us. We do just what they did, but we do it beyond
the speed of sound.</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: By the end of Vietnam we upped our kill ratio
to thirteen to one.</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: You’re here ’cause you’re the top one per
cent of all naval aviators.</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: You’re the elite, the best of the best. We’re
gonna make you better, because you’re job is damned important.</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: With the tensions in the world today, the
potential for confron- tation is greater than ever, and carrier pilots
will be the first ones there. Air combat excellence is vital.</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: …Someone once asked me if training men for
air combat made the world less safe–flying loaded guns… an accidental
confrontation and so forth…</p>
<p><strong>angle - viper</strong>: VIPER My answer is: the dangerous
thing is being unprepared. You want trouble, that’s what you get when
things don’t work out, when you can’t do what you say you can. When you
don’t know what you can do. And when your opponents aren’t sure either.
We are not policy. We don’t make policy. Elected officials …civilians,
do that. We are the instrument of policy. The tip of the spear. So we
had best be sharp.</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Nothing…That’s McGown…that’s Singer, isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: Turn around, pay attention. What are you
doing?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: …Just wondering… …who is the best.</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: Really… Ya know. We’d like to know who’s best
too. That’s why we’ve got that plaque on the wall… with the Top Top Gun
crew from each class. You think maybe your name’s gonna be on it?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: Considering the company you’re in, that’s a
pretty arrogant attitude.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: I like that in a fighter pilot. It’s okay to
be confident. You have to think you’re King Kong to want to try to land
on carriers. Just keep in mind the other component of
success…teamwork.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: Gentlemen, this is about combat. Remember,
there are no points for second place. Dismissed. Viper walks out.
Maverick finds Goose looking at him, quizzically. Others mill around the
plaque. A big, friendly bear of a RIO speaks.</p>
<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: A plaque?</p>
<p><strong>hollywood</strong>: It’s not the plaque. The winner can get
assigned here as instructor. He gets to fight every day.</p>
<p><strong>a7 pilot</strong>: You know the Fighter Pilots motto? It’s
better to be dead than to look bad.</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: I don’t know, Frank, anybody gets off on
bombing the shit out of dirt has got to be queer.</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: Keller, Black Lion Squadron. I knew him at
Pensacola. He’s damn good.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Is there anybody in the Navy you don’t
know?</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: Gotta keep track of the competition.</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: Slider – they let you into Top Gun? If you’re
among the best in the Navy, I tremble for the security of this
country.</p>
<p><strong>slider</strong>: Why Goose, whose butt did you kiss to get
here?</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: The list is long, but distinguished.</p>
<p><strong>slider</strong>: So’s my Johnson.</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: This is Maverick.</p>
<p><strong>slider</strong>: So I’ve heard.</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: Who’s your pilot?</p>
<p><strong>slider</strong>: Tom Kazansky.</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: No shit. The Iceman….</p>
<p><strong>slider</strong>: Mister to you.</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: You think you can stay up with us.</p>
<p><strong>slider</strong>: I think, yeah, we’ll show you a thing or
two.</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: This is Evan Mitchell, he steers the
thing.</p>
<p><strong>slider</strong>: So I heard. Steers it pretty close. Sorry to
hear about Cougar. He was a good man.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Still is..</p>
<p><strong>slider</strong>: Yeah. That’s what I meant.</p>
<p><strong>slider</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: Flaming Hooker. Sort of an institution around
here. Or maybe this is the institution, I forget which. It’s the house
drink. It’ll warm the cockles of your heart … and other things depending
on where you spill it.</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: You can’t show fear in front of
Marines…They’re like Doberman’s they’ll go for your throat, it’s
instinctive.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: You ever done this before?</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: What, been drunk? Sure! Plenty!</p>
<p><strong>slider</strong>: How was it?</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: Could use a dash more jet fuel.</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: Careful, don’t make an ash of yourself…</p>
<p><strong>sundown</strong>: Yeow!</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: Mayday! Down in flames!</p>
<p><strong>sundown</strong>: Thanks, I needed that.</p>
<p><strong>hollywood</strong>: You guys are not only crazy, you’re
dangerous!</p>
<p><strong>ice</strong>: Frat boys.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Who is that guy?</p>
<p><strong>hollywood</strong>: That’s Kazanski.</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: No shit! That why they call him Ice?</p>
<p><strong>hollywood</strong>: Nope. It’s the way he flies - Ice cold.
No mistakes. Wears you down. After enough time, you just get bored and
frustrated, you do something stupid, and he’s got you.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Why do you all have such funny names?</p>
<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: You gotta have a call sign that’s just your
own…never changes…you have to recognize it immediately. Then, if someone
shouts “Wolf, break left!”..you react right away.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Why do they call you Wolf?</p>
<p><strong>woldfman</strong>: Oh, I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: Hey Mav, this is Sally. She doesn’t believe a
word I say. Tell her I’m married, will you?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Yeah, he’s married–but then again, he,s
not dead.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Could I get a call sign?</p>
<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: Well, I don’t know. That depends.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: On what?</p>
<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: Well, it doesn’t just happen, you gotta do
something famous.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: Oh…I’ll think of something.</p>
<p><strong>iceman</strong>: Figured it out yet?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Figured out what?</p>
<p><strong>iceman</strong>: Who is the best.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>iceman</strong>: Need a hint?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: I think I can work it out on my own.</p>
<p><strong>iceman</strong>: You like to work alone. I’ve heard that
about you.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: I’ve heard of you, too. You were in 124
with Bargamian.</p>
<p><strong>iceman</strong>: And you were with Cougar. He was my roommate
in flight school.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: He’s a good man.</p>
<p><strong>iceman</strong>: The best.</p>
<p><strong>slider</strong>: You must have soloed under a lucky star.
First the MiG, then you slide into Cougar’s place.</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: It’s not Cougar’s place. It’s ours.</p>
<p><strong>ice</strong>: What do you think it was? Was it that MiG
contact that did it?</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: Did what?</p>
<p><strong>ice</strong>: Got you here.</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: We’re here because we’re the best flyers in
the wing. Not because of some MiG encounter.</p>
<p><strong>slider</strong>: What luck! Guys fly their whole career
without seeing a MiG up close…You’re famous.</p>
<p><strong>ice</strong>: You mean notorious.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: What do these guys think, I made Cougar
quit?</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: Pay no attention to it. They’re just trying
to rattle you. It’s all psychological. Sit down..and drink.</p>
<p><strong>bugs</strong>: We were just really diving down and by then we
were right over downtown Haiphong. It was some great shit. Jack says,
“What are you doing?” “What, what am I doing, Jack?” He says, “What are
you doing?” I said, “I’m rolling in, Jack.” “Bugs, we’re at thirty-two
hundred feet. Oh shit, we were like zooom… So we scraped down at hundred
feet right over–downtown Hanoi! Oh shit, goddamn it! And blowing down
the river. And so once we were there we let down to about fifty feet
just going down the river and Jack says…”Bugs… don’t ever do that
again!” “Okay, right, Jack, I’ll never do that again!”</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: What, what is it?</p>
<p><strong>hollywood</strong>: Target passing. Check your six.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Never mind mine. Check hers.</p>
<p><strong>hollywood</strong>: Her six is a ten! Uh oh, a turn to
engage.</p>
<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: Bogey…9 o’clock level.</p>
<p><strong>sundown</strong>: Nine thirty. Bogey? You presume that
hostile?</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: The family unit – that’s the most important
thing. It’s the only thing you can count on. I’m married –did I tell you
that?</p>
<p><strong>first girl</strong>: Four times. We don’t believe you.</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: I’ve been married since I was eighteen. Why
don’t you believe me?</p>
<p><strong>second girl</strong>: Because you don’t look married.</p>
<p><strong>first girl</strong>: You’re not even wearing a ring.</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: I take it off when I’m chasing women. It’s
the only honorable thing to do.</p>
<p><strong>hollywood</strong>: You don’t think about death up there, but
you think a lot about the danger. One mistake and you’re a smoking hole
in the ground.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I never knew it was so dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>hollywood</strong>: Oh yeah, it makes everything down here
more meaningful. You feel a certain intensity of life, and you want to
grab onto every moment.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Long cruise, was it?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Anything I can do to help, Lieutenant?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Lots of things.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’ll bet!</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Uhhh…Anything I can do for you? She laughs
again, doesn’t know what it is…could be chemical, but she’s
instinctively attracted.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Yeah. Hold this. It might be safer.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Now I know why all the girls come here.
They know how horny you guys get. But this…is ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: It’s not that.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: It isn’t?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Well, it is. It is that, too.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: That’s a big comfort to me.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: I could be, too.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: How so?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Save you from a big mistake with that
other guy.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: And on to a bigger one with you?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Yeah, most likely.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Was there ever a girl who didn’t like
fighter pilots?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: I heard of one once.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’m really flattered, Lieutenant, but I
don’t go out with pilots.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Then what are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I think the question is…what are you?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Hi. I’m here to talk about a new concept
in cosmetics…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: My fault. Should have watched where I was
going.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Uh, nobody, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Too bad.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: See you around.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Can I walk you out?She turns back to him,
a smile.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’m with someone.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: I thought he’d never leave.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Yeow!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You! What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Everybody’s got to be somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What if Captain Dawson had come with
me?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: It would have been really
embarrassing!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: How did you know this was my car?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Simple deduction. It’s fast. It’s pretty.
Sleek and stylish…It’s your color…matches your lipstick.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: That’s all!</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: And I asked someone.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You think you’re pretty smart.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: I think I’m in love.</p>
<p><strong>marine</strong>: Can I help you, Ma’am?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I don’t know, Corporal. Can you do anything
about this lunatic?</p>
<p><strong>flex</strong>: Not so fast…my head.</p>
<p><strong>jester</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>sundown</strong>: I’m Sundown.</p>
<p><strong>jester</strong>: Yeah, right. You’re late.</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: And who are you?</p>
<p><strong>flex</strong>: Flex</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: Flex…? You don’t look like Flex to me. You
call that muscle? Doesn’t look like muscle. Looks like…Pork.</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: What’re you laughing at? You’re Fungus.</p>
<p><strong>sundown/fungus</strong>: Fungus!</p>
<p><strong>pork</strong>: Don’t make an issue of it, it’ll stick.</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: Now to continue. In this class we will be
dealing with F-5’s and A4’s, as our MiG simulators. Technically the F-5
does not have the thrust to weight ratio of the MiG-21–it also does not
bleed energy below 300 knots like the MiG-21 does. The A4 does not turn
as well as the MiG-17 but has significantly better visibility.</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: Hi, Charlie. Good, our TAGREF’s here.
Charlie’s the most qualified to get into P subs and curves, and VN
diagrams.</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: Charlotte Blackwood–code name Charlie– not
your ordinary TAGREF. Charlie has her Ph.D. in astrophysics–she’s a
civilian contractor so you don’t salute her…or anything else. Is that
clear?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Hello, I think I have some new data for
you…Now a MiG 21 has a problem with the inverted flight tanks. It won’t
do a Negative G push over. Even below one G, they risk a flame out.
Operationally, they will do a zero to one G only.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: I don’t think you’re altogether
right…about the MiG, that is.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I beg your pardon.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: No, I beg yours. But I don’t think you’re
right on that.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: I saw one.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You saw a MiG 21?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: I saw a MiG do a 4 G negative dive.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Where did you see that?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: It’s classified.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: It’s what?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: It’s classified. Like Hollywood says, I
could tell you, but then I’d have to kill you.</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: Maverick!!!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: It’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Lieutenant, I have a top secret clearance.
The Pentagon sees to it that I know more than you.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Not in this case.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You saw a MiG push negative 4G?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Yes, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Where were you?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: On his six.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: He was in a 4G Negative dive and you were
on his six?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Yes, ma’am, At first. Then I was directly
above him.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: If you were directly above him, how did you
see him?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: I was inverted.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You were in a 4G inverted dive with a MiG
21?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Two.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Two miles.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Two meters.</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: One and a half, actually. I got a
polaroid.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Lieutenant…</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Ma’am?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What were you doing there?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Giving him the bird.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: The what?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: You know. The finger.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: So you’re the reason those SALT talks
failed.</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: Lieutenant!</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: It’s just like he says, sir.</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: I don’t care!</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Why didn’t you tell me you were a</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: It never came up.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: You let me make a fool of myself.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You seemed determined to do that anyway..
Why didn’t you tell me you were a famous MiG insulter?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Would it have made a difference?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: What would?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You know, I’m assigned to this school. I
see sixteen new hotshots every eight weeks. Your attention is
flattering, but not really productive. Why don’t you keep your mind on
flying.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Why can’t you keep this straight?</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: Maverick… Where’d you get that call sign?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Ahhh… Runs in the family, sir.</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: You’re father was Marvin Mitchell..</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: A good man. Good flyer.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Yes sir. Thank you sir.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: I’ve lost him – where is he?</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: On your six – coming hard. Four hundred.
Losing airspeed! He’s on your six and closing fast! Hard left! HARD
LEFT!</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: Great move. Great</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: He should’ve had me.</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: Take it down. Let’s bug out of here. Call for
a draw.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: No way. I’ll nail him this time. Going
vertical.</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: He’s blind – you got him!</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: He’s out of energy! You got control?
Unload!</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: He’s right. We’re at ten thousand.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: No way. I got you, sucker. You’re going
down.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: In the envelope. FOX TWO MISSILE</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: Goddamn! We beat him!</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: We did it!</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: Look, Ma, top of the world!</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: Ahhh…A little high on the left, don’t you
think?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: Right. Much better. …Ahhh…what do you call
this?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: It’s a victory roll.</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: I wouldn’t call it victory. It’s more
like…self immolation.</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: Hi…Hi there. How ya doing in there? Mav…
Ahhh…you know, at one point I did want a Navy career.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Come on, relax…</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: You see all those guys with gold on their
shoulders!!?… Oh, no, I think that was Johnson, Air Boss of the Kitty
Hawk!</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Come on, we beat an instructor. How many
times in your life do you get to do a victory roll?</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: Just once, if they take your plane away.</p>
<p><strong>iceman</strong>: Cowboys!</p>
<p><strong>slider</strong>: Nice. Always a good idea to show up your
instructors. He nods toward Jester, glaring at them from his A4. Goose
indicates the backseat of the Tomcat.</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: Hey, see any controls back there? And
anyway…we beat the Son of a Bitch!</p>
<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: You won?!!!</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Didn’t everybody?</p>
<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: No, we…got our butts kicked.</p>
<p><strong>hollywood</strong>: Thirty seconds. That’s all it took to
blow us out of the sky.</p>
<p><strong>hollywood</strong>: And he’s laughing. Right over the radio,
He’s laughing at us.</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: You won. Congratulations. HOLLYWOOD Maverick
and Goose won too.</p>
<p><strong>ice</strong>: That’s not what I heard.</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: We won! Ice turns back, stares them down,
then turns back into his locker, dismissing them.</p>
<p><strong>ice</strong>: Below the hard deck doesn’t count. You guys are
the second team, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>jester</strong>: Maverick, Goose. Viper’s office. Now!</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: Well….That about covers the flyby.</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: Now…in addition…you broke two major rules of
engagement. And… That’s …not good.</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: Lieutenant Candela lost sight of you, and
called “no joy”. You failed to respond.</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: I had him in view. I was peeling over the
egg, into a dive. He saw me when I moved in for the kill. There wasn’t
any danger…</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: Is that how you remember it?</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: Yes, sir. By the time we could respond, we
were diving right into his view.</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: The hard deck for this hop was ten thousand
feet. Jester, at what point did you call off the fight?</p>
<p><strong>jester</strong>: Just below ten thousand.</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: But you continued to fight.</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: We weren’t below for more than ten
seconds. There was no danger. I had the shot. I took it.</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: The rules of engagement are not flexible.
They exist for your safety. You will obey them. Is that clear?</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: I guess you were. Dismissed.</p>
<p><strong>jester</strong>: I don’t know what to tell you, Skip.</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: Tell me one thing.</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: …If you had to go into combat, would you want
him with you?</p>
<p><strong>jester</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>jester</strong>: He’s seat of the pants… Completely
unpredictable – nothing by the book. All over the sky. But I don’t know,
Skip, he’s really got something.</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: Yeah, we get one of these guys every damn
class. “Maverick!”</p>
<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: No. No. Look out, you lost it.</p>
<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: We’re dead!</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: Man, you guys gooned it. Your laser butts are
scattered across KANSAS.</p>
<p><strong>hollywood</strong>: Come on. I died enough for one night.</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: Have you guys ever considered career
counseling?</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: What happened.</p>
<p><strong>tech</strong>: What did you do in there?</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: What did you do? You broke it!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You flew it off the template. Nobody ever
did that before.</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: That’s what she said last night.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What is it about you?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: What would you say, too fast…too
quick…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: And far too aggressive.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: It is combat. Every second counts.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Well, what you need…what you have to keep
looking for…what you want to get is a wingman who can stay up with you.
Who can match you move for move. Then you’ve got something. I’m
sorry.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: That stuff about the MiG. I was out of
line.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Apology acknowledged.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Is that all?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What else do you want?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Um. You.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: There you go with those moves again.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Too aggressive?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I don’t mix with the boys. I work here.
Let’s keep it professional.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: I’m special.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Yes. I’ll give you that!</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Give me a break, I’m asking you out.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: I thought there was something… That night
in the club…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Lieutenant…</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Evan… or Maverick.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Maverick…you know the rules of
engagement.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: The what?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Some one comes up hot on your six, what do
you do?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You turn into him, check him out, identify
friend or foe.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: I’m not your foe.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: And if he’s harmless, you disengage.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Harmless!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Uh hum.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: What if he’s not?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You have to shoot him down….If he’s smart,
he’ll turn away before that happens.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: And probably never again. It’s nothing
personal. It’s just…I know a lot of pilots. Maybe I’m immune…</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Don’t worry, I’m a new strain. And I don’t
give up. Everything I’ve ever wanted I’ve had to work like hell for.
Well, how about it?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: How about what?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: How about anything, anything you want to
do.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Hard to argue with that, isn’t it…</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: A date… Coffee… A drink…A walk in the
park.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What about the plane?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: What plane.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Most of them invite me to sit in the
cockpit…play with the levers and things.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Well, get used to it.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Used to what?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: I’m different.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’m starting to sense that now.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Let’s make it at eight.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Make what?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Anything.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Okay, anything. Just…go. I’ve gotta
work.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Why’d you do that?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: It dies. We live.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You’re an animal.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: That’s true. What are you?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I don’t enjoy watching things suffer.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: It’s not suffering anymore.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You’re horrible</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: You’re not, cause you eat frozen
meatballs? Things die. Every time you breathe, you kill millions of tiny
organisms. Every time you eat, something had to die.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You don’t have to kill it.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Somebody does. It’s more honest this way.
You do your own dirty work.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You ever think about killing another human
being?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: About as much as they think about killing
me.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Does it bother you?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: They know the rules… strong for her, she
turns away, he That’s the deal. That’s why you’re up there. It’s him or
me. That’s the price of admission. It bothers you, why? You’re part of
it. Everybody dies. Most people don’t get to die for something.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Flying?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: You use your mind to keep things at a
distance. You ever just let go?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: You know what really scares me? Living too
long. Losing my hair and my teeth…and my guts and my wind. And my
brains…Sitting in a room with my hands in my lap, watching daytime
TV.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You don’t believe any of this. You don’t
think you’ll ever die.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: That’s it, of course. When I’m up there
and doing it, I’m cheating it every second. I’m subverting all
laws…gravity…whatever. I’m skating the edge of it.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Winston Churchill.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What he said…“There’s nothing so
exhilarating as being shot at without result.”</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: All you’ve got is one life. I guess it’s
worth about the same to every body. You ever see an old woman after her
husband has died? And the meaningless years of decline stretch ahead…
When you’re in the air and doing something really dangerous, you can
look ahead… maybe ten seconds. That’s your whole future. That’s as far
as it goes. But imagine what those seconds are worth.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What if you kill yourself? Think of
everything you’ll miss.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: There is lots of stuff I don’t know about…
Fine wine… great art… the opera. I guess if I live long enough, I’ll get
to it. If I don’t, I’ll never miss it.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Are you really that brave?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: I watched my mother die. Cancer. She had a
long time to think about it. They say you reach an agreement with death.
Come to accept the fact that pretty soon you won’t be here. I didn’t see
that. She… was very brave…braver than I am. You go up there, there isn’t
time to think. If you make a mistake, you’re just a smudge on the
ground. Simplifies funeral arrangements.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: It’s just as I thought.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You’re totally insane.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Thanks very much. Care for some
suchi?.</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: Come on, we’re next.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: Come on, I got over six bucks on the
line.</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: Come on, come on! It’s double or nothing..
We’re talking twelve bucks American, here.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: I’ve had enough…for now.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: You want to go ballistic?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I don’t know. I don’t like being out of
control.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Stick with me, you’ll get used to it.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: I always wanted to fly… ever since I first
saw a jet. I wanted to fly jets, then I wanted F-14’s, then I wanted to
fly off carriers, then I wanted Top Gun.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: And now?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: And now I want you.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You always get what you want?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: I don’t know yet.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I want it understood.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Anything.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: No fooling on base, no signs, no comments,
no talk. By anyone.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’m a professional. You guys are in my line
of work.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Acknowleged.</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: The bandit has good position right here. All
right, freeze here. The moment of choice – Maverick is defensive. He has
a chance to bug out right here….Better to retire and save your plane
than force a bad position. Stay in the diamond another three seconds,
the bandit will blow you out of the sky…make a hard right, select zone
5… you can extend and escape. You make a bad choice. Roll forward.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: I wasn’t thinking. I just did it.</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: Big gamble with a thirty million dollar
plane!</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: No guts, no glory.</p>
<p><strong>slider</strong>: Your guts. His glory.</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: Unfortunately, the gamble worked, or you
might have learned something. The bandit never gets a clean
shot…Maverick makes an aggressive vertical move here, comes over the top
and defeats the bandit with a missile shot. The encounter was a victory,
but we’ve shown it as an example of what not to do. Ice is next.</p>
<p><strong>hollywood</strong>: Gutsiest move I ever saw.</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: And the dumbest…Okay, look at this. It’s
textbook. Ice takes control of the battle immediately. He never gives
the bandit a chance to take the offensive. An early turn here –
excellent. He goes for the jugular, and it’s over just that quick. Let’s
run that again, it’s exactly how it should be done.</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: What the hell is this?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Don’t chew it, you won’t have it that
long. Easier to clean the cockpit if it comes up in big chunks.</p>
<p><strong>jester</strong>: On the run. Let’s go. Move it!</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: A fighter pilot’s lunch… a hot dog and a
puke.</p>
<p><strong>hollywood</strong>: I was a victim of circumstance.</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: They should have warned you about that
one.</p>
<p><strong>hollywood</strong>: She’s kinky for flight suits–said that
she’d never seen so many zippers–played with them all night. The noise
alone kept me up.</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: What’d you do?</p>
<p><strong>hollywood</strong>: Pulled left, rolled out, underneath.</p>
<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: It’s kind of ironic. All you guys have
women troubles and I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>hollywood</strong>: That’s because you don’t have any
women.</p>
<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: Until last night. Did you see the moves I
was making on that girl at the party?</p>
<p><strong>hollywood</strong>: The girl with the purple fingernails?</p>
<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: That’s her–tall hungry woman with fire in
her eyes. It was great.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: It was bad.</p>
<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: Bad?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: The girl with the purple fingernails was
Coogan’s sister.</p>
<p><strong>hollywood</strong>: Coogan spent half the night looking for
her. He said he was gonna kill the son-of-a-bitch who ruined his
sister.</p>
<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: I didn’t ruin her.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: You didn’t help.</p>
<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: No, really. She came ruined!… Ya think he
knows it was me?</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: Seemed not to. But it’s hard to know. You
never can tell what’s in the mind of a psychopath.</p>
<p><strong>hollywood</strong>: Hear about Ice?</p>
<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: What now?</p>
<p><strong>hollywood</strong>: He won again.</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: Something bothering you?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Nothing. Let’s just go fight.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Morning, Coogan.</p>
<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: How’s it goin’, Coog?</p>
<p><strong>hollywood</strong>: Ever find your sister, Coogan?</p>
<p><strong>coogan</strong>: You guys know somethin’ about that?</p>
<p><strong>hollywood</strong>: Holy shit, it’s Viper.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Keep your shirt on, he’s saying holy shit
it’s us.</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: Bogey at three o’clock high! Nose on!</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: Just cover Wood, Maverick. Mutual support,
man!</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: I’m gonna take him, Goose.</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: Don’t be greedy. Stay with Wood.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: I want him!</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: Hey, come on–hey!</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: What what are you doing? We’re cover!</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Wood’s okay. I want Viper.</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: But we’re cover!</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: What’s the range, Goose. I’ve got a good
tone.</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: Two bogies ! Three o’clock high, nine o’clock
high! Break!</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: Ya know, that was the best flying I’ve seen
since Nam… …Right up to that part where you got killed.</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: Twenty years’ experience, I couldn’t shake
you. You may be a great flyer. I mean that.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: I lost.</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: Of course you did. I said a great flyer, not
a smart one. You fly reckless. Great instincts. No discipline. That
ambush today, you followed your emotions instead of your wingman. Of
course you got killed…and well deserved to. It was a really stupid
mistake. In battle, it gets people killed.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: I can take care of myself.</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: Talent is no holy shield. Von Richtofen was
killed by a farm boy. Instincts are not enough. Do it our way. We’ve
worked these things out. The good pilots can become better and the great
ones can learn how to stay alive. Why do you have to do everything the
hard way?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: It’s my own way. It works for me. I don’t
care about the rest of that stuff.</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: Then why are you here?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: For the same reason you are.</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: Oh, you mean the thrill!</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: The flying. The fighting. I’d go up there
ten times a day to fight. I’d win at least nine of them. That’s all I
want to do. It’s what I do best. I am real good. Just give me the
jet.</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: It’s not a gift, just a loan…</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: Nine out of ten is okay, as long as it’s only
fun and games. But this isn’t about that. This is serious business. It
is dangerous up there! At 500 knots, things can change a lot in a
second. Discipline is what protects us.</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: It was a good day. You learned something. You
lost and you’re still alive to think about it. And, you lost your
wingman. That’s a cardinal sin…don’t ever do it again. You owe Hollywood
an apology and you owe me a beer.</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: Relationships are a bitch, here. It’s hard
enough to concentrate …under the pressure. Having a woman here is asking
for it.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: I guess that’s what I’m doing, then.</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: Where do you find the time? Where do you find
the energy. It’s tough enough to keep your mind on school. A woman here
is a real pain in the…</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: …butt…Hi, honey, God, am I glad to see you! I
missed you.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: I had to come, Willard, I got so lonesome I
just couldn’t stand it.</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: Sure, honey, I understand. It’s great to see
you. Hey where’s your backseater, where’s the world’s smallest RIO..</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Food…and you…my F-14!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: In that order?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Well no…inverse order.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’m still second best.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: You ever fly an F-14?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I don’t fly in anything that doesn’t show
movies.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Ahhh, you’d love it. Night carrier
landings! The most dangerous thing you can think of! …next to you…And
the most exciting. You’re living at one hundred and ten per cent.
Greatest high in the world…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Danger?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: . Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Doesn’t it ever bother you?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Why, what’s gonna happen?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Lucky charm.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What do you take me for? It’s a Navy
Cross.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Just good luck.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Where’d you get it.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Pawn shop. What’s to eat?</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: …MiG sweep over the water. You will proceed
down the one-seven -zero degree radial looking for MiGs. You will engage
all that you find, destroy them, and return to base. Maverick, has the
lead. Any questions? All right, let’s go. Move like you’ve got a
purpose….</p>
<p><strong>ice</strong>: Sonofabitch.</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: Oh, no!</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: Plane’s coupling up! Plane’s coupling up!</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: This is not good!… We’re low!</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: I’m pinned to the panel.</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: Time to go.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: I can’t eject.</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: 3000 feet. I’ll do it.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Go ahead. I can’t reach. 2000 feet!</p>
<p><strong>goose</strong>: 1000.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Let’s go. Eject.</p>
<p><strong>frogman</strong>: Let him go, sir. Take it easy.</p>
<p><strong>frogman</strong>: Sir! Let him go. It’s all right. Let him
go.</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: How do you feel?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: Goose is dead.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: I know. I was there.</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: If you fly jets long enough, something like
this happens to you. No one escapes it. It touches us all.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: He was…my responsibility–my RIO.</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: My first squadron in Vietnam, we lost eight
out of eighteen planes. Ten guys. The first one kills you, but there’ll
be others–you can count on it.</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: You’ve got to put him in the box.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: …they say you’re alright.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: This is it, then.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: The dark side. The price you pay for all
the fun you’re having. You knew about it, of course. Didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: He was a friend of mine. A good guy…great
guy. It was my fault.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: That’s not what I hear.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: I was flying…my responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: That’s what you get flight pay for.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Maybe I shouldn’t take it.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Why? You act like you didn’t know one day
this would happen.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Not to me.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You knew it. You all do. It’s part of it.
Maybe the most important part.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Where are we?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Where are we? You know where we are. It’s
called the beach. It’s where life first crawled up out of the sea. I
come here sometimes… when I feel like crawling back in.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: You don’t have to do this.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Do what, show you a good time?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: I’m not good company. I should be
alone.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I don’t think so, but if that’s what you
want…</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: I want it back.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You look way out there. Out past the date
line. West becomes East, all things change. You cross the line…today
becomes yesterday…or tomorrow, I forget which.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: That’s what I want.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Of course the line’s just imaginary. You
can cross it twenty times…nothing really changes.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: On the beach… It’s what they say when Navy
men retire…He’s “On The Beach”. I always liked that. I had a picture…in
my head… all these old guys wandering around here, looking out into the
past.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: If we knew then, what we know now, we
might never have come up out of there.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You don’t believe that.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Hardly ever.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Only when you’re depressed. Then it
passes.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: It does.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Everything passes. Immutable law of the
Universe.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: This too…shall pass. You put as much life
as you can between it and you. You start piling up experience between
then and now.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: What do you do when you come here?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I sit. I think. I play games.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: What kind of games?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I like to play “reality”.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: How do you play reality.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: It’s strip reality, actually, like what the
pilots always want to play.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Strip reality! How do you play that?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: It’s like strip poker, only, without the
bluffing. One person says something and if the other one accepts that
it’s true, the one who says it, gets to take one item of clothing
off.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: You’re crazy. That’s a pretty silly
game.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Not as silly as some. You know the silliest
one? …that we are gods. That we control events on the beach… that we can
turn back time…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Want to play the game?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: How does it go?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You say the truth. Go ahead. Don’t be
afraid. You want to win the game, don’tcha?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: What truth?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: The big one. The one that’s most on your
mind.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Goose is dead.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: True.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Now?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Take something off.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Off me or off you?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: That’s up to you.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: It’s dangerous…what you do.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: It was my fault.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You can’t bring him back.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: It was my fault.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Nope. Already used that.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Your life goes on.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: What does it mean?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: That wasn’t fair. It was a question.
Penalty round!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You didn’t mean it. You didn’t think. You’d
do anything to take it back.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: That’s three.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: And that’s one!</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: One more.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Your watch.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: You owe me one.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Looks like a tie.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Who’s gonna win?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: We’ll say it together. On the count of
three…One…two…</p>
<p><strong>bothtogether</strong>: I love.ove y.you.</p>
<p><strong>cdr.</strong>: The Board of Inquiry finds that Lt. Evan
Mitchell was not at fault in the accident of twenty-nine July.</p>
<p><strong>cdr.</strong>: Lt. Mitchell’s record will be cleared of this
incident.</p>
<p><strong>cdr.</strong>: Lt. Mitchell is restored to flight status
without further delay. These proceedings are closed.</p>
<p><strong>jester</strong>: He just won’t engage. He can’t do it,
Skipper. He can’t get back on the horse.</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: It’s only been a week. Keep sending him
up.</p>
<p><strong>jester</strong>: I’ve seen this before.</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: So have I.</p>
<p><strong>jester</strong>: Some guys never get it back.</p>
<p><strong>fungus</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Saving them some paperwork.</p>
<p><strong>fungus</strong>: Since when did you care about paperwork?</p>
<p><strong>fungus</strong>: If I could fly like you I’d have everything
I want. If I could fly at all. I can’t fly. I can’t fly like that.
Nobody can. Whatever it is, you’ve got it!</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Not anymore.</p>
<p><strong>fungus</strong>: So, you’re scared–so what? You ever get a
good look at me in the back seat, I’m goddamn terrified.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Never liked fighter pilots anyway.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: You came to the right place.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’ll have what he’s having… Hemlock, is
it?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You weren’t gonna say goodbye?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: I was, later.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Long distance? I wouldn’t do that to you.
I’d at least talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: I didn’t want to see you. I mean, I
did…but I didn’t..</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I know exactly what you mean.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: How could you?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’ve got a gift just like you do. My gift
is I just know what people mean, even if they can’t say it. It helps
when you’re trying to communicate with fighter pilots. Like what you
just said was “I’m embarrassed, I feel I’ve done something wrong, that
I’ve failed, and I don’t think I can live up to the expectations of a
wonderful interesting, intelligent woman like yourself.” That about
it?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: …Something like that.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: And I’m gonna sneak off, and be by myself
for awhile, like until I can think of a new career…hotel management or
something…</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Big talk for someone who’s never been shot
off her computer.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Hey, I never said I was a fighter pilot…I
never claimed to think it was fun to be shot off the end of a ship in a
storm. I can find contentment in a good book. I don’t have to roar by
someone at Mach two with my hair on fire. Sometimes…I just get happy
being with the right man.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: I hope you find him.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I think I have… I could be wrong. I have
been before. Just remember one thing. If you’re not Top Gun, if you’re
not fighting jets, you’re not gonna be able to act like a fighter pilot…
You’re gonna have to act like the rest of us. You’re gonna have to
master humility. For you guys, that’s the toughest maneuver of all.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: So long, Sailor. See you on the beach
sometime.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Dad…Of all the aminals in the ocean, which
one’s the baddest?</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: I don’t know, Tim. You’ll have to ask
them.</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: Runs in the family…</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Skipper, sorry to bother you.</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: No bother.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: I called your house.</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: My wife’s house.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: She said you took your kid to the each.
Every second Sunday. Zoo or beach or the ballgame. Y’have the option…
What about me?</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: We can send you back to your squadron with
nothing noted on your record except “CNC” –course not completed, no
explanation required. Theoretically, it doesn’t hurt your career, but
people always wonder about things like that.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Or….</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: Or you can quit.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: I didn’t know either. That’s why I told
Jester to prepare your papers.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: You’ve already made up your mind.</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: It’s no disgrace, kid. That spin was hell. It
would wreck anyone’s confidence. You could be a good pilot again
someday…</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: You think I should quit?!</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: I didn’t say that. That’s up to you. But I
have responsibility for the other guys up there, not just you. They need
to know you’re all right…that they can depend on you.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Here, let me get this. We’ll be even.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Lucky charm.</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: Sometimes it’s luck, but in this case, he
earned it… I served with your old man.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: VF 51, the Oriskany. You remind me of him.
You’re just like he was, only better…and worse.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: I’m nothing like him.</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: You may not think so, but you are.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: He was by the book, all the way.</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: They waved him off. He thought he knew
better. He hit the ramp.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: I never heard that.</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: Not something they tell dependents.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: It’s not true.</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: Why would I lie?</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: You start on a wrong heading… the more you
stick to it, the further you get from your target. A good pilot always
questions himself, always questions his judgments, stays alert for drift
and makes the corrections…You may find a little discipline helps with
the fear. You don’t have to be alone up there.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: How can I go on? I feel so…
responsible.</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: Kid, the plain fact is…you are. I’m not gonna
stand here and blow sunshine up your ass. Technically, they absolved
you. You and I know what really happened. You pushed it. You are
responsible and you’ll always carry that. You know what, I’ll carry it
too. I should have taken you out of that cockpit. I guess I’m a hopeless
romantic… I always try to find something worthwhile in someone’s death.
It’s no trade-off. It’s not one for one. What you learned isn’t worth
his death. It couldn’t be. But maybe there is some value in it. I know
it’s the first thing I’ve ever seen that’s really gotten to you. Now the
question is, what will you do with it. If it gets you out of flight
status…so you don’t kill yourself or anybody else…that’s good. That’s
one good thing. You were an accident waiting to happen.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: You think I shouldn’t fly.</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: I didn’t say that. That’s up to you. I think
that if you do, if you choose to come back, you’ll be a better pilot… a
better man.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Would you take me back? Would they?</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: I’ll have to think about it. I don’t know
about them. I do know one thing, We’ve got a lot invested in you. We’d
hate to lose it. Even more than those other guys, Naval Aviation needs a
very few, very good men.</p>
<p><strong>fungus</strong>: I don’t know where he is…</p>
<p><strong>pork</strong>: What are his plans?</p>
<p><strong>fungus</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>fungus</strong>: I’m glad.</p>
<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: Good to see you, man.</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: Gentlemen, you know how I hate to break up
this party before it has a chance to get really out of hand… …but
there’s a major flap on.</p>
<p><strong>hollywood</strong>: We’re being called back?</p>
<p><strong>viper</strong>: You’re on your way. Don’t bother going to
BOQ. Your bags are packed.</p>
<p><strong>stinger</strong>: …Navy oceanographic ship… international
waters… fired upon… unknown forces…</p>
<p><strong>stinger</strong>: …by unknown forces…by Migs. We don’t know
who they are. All I know is that it’s our ship, and our orders are to
escort it out of the area.</p>
<p><strong>stinger</strong>: This is “Bullseye”. A rescue operation is
to begin within the hour. Your mission is to give air support to that
rescue. There are MiGs in the area, and tensions are high. If you
witness a hostile act you will return fire. We will be covering 360
degrees of the compass by section. Be prepared for anything.</p>
<p><strong>slider</strong>: Ice and Hollywood, sector two.</p>
<p><strong>slider</strong>: And Maverick. You’ll back them up, on Ready
Five.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Yessir.</p>
<p><strong>two more – two more contacts.</strong>: 2-7-0 at 10 MILES. WE
NEED SOME</p>
<p><strong>ice</strong>: Do you have them? Did they get out or not?</p>
<p><strong>slider</strong>: No contact. I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>fungus</strong>: Let’s go! Dive on those bastards!</p>
<p><strong>fungus</strong>: Come on, man, engage. This is it. Get your
nose in there.</p>
<p><strong>fungus</strong>: Bandit at seven o’clock low–solo. Take him.
Pull on the goddamn stick, man!</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Okay, okay.</p>
<p><strong>fungus</strong>: Don’t tell me okay. Do it!</p>
<p><strong>ice</strong>: Ah Nuts!</p>
<p><strong>ice</strong>: Son of a bitch!</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Zone 5 burners.</p>
<p><strong>fungus</strong>: We’re ballistic! Ohhhhhh Shit!</p>
<p><strong>fungus</strong>: Ohhh Mother!</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Goddamnit, Mav, you really are a slow
learner. Don’t worry, Fung, I’ve got it.</p>
<p><strong>fungus</strong>: Don’t WORRY!!!? You’ve GOT it!!? Are you
CRAZY?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Roger, I’ve got it.</p>
<p><strong>fungus</strong>: You’ve got it? Good! Cause for a minute
there, you had me worried.</p>
<p><strong>fungus</strong>: Now have you got it? Have you still got
it?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Yawing right.</p>
<p><strong>fungus</strong>: I know!</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Rudder’s left, stick’s forward.</p>
<p><strong>fungus</strong>: Swell! Passing ten thousand!</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: I’ve got it – hold on!</p>
<p><strong>fungus</strong>: Passing 8. Passing 6. Lock your harness!</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: I can recover. Hold on!</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: You with me?</p>
<p><strong>fungus</strong>: Right behind you.</p>
<p><strong>fungus</strong>: Speed’s up to 150.</p>
<p><strong>fungus</strong>: 5000 feet. Speed two hundred.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>fungus</strong>: 4500. Critical point.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: No! Not again!</p>
<p><strong>fungus</strong>: What are you talking about, we gotta go!</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: I’m not losing it again!</p>
<p><strong>fungus</strong>: Gotta go, man.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: 280, 290, 300 knots.</p>
<p><strong>fungus</strong>: 3,000 feet. We gotta go, man. 3,000 feet, we
gotta go!</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: You go. I’m staying with it.</p>
<p><strong>fungus</strong>: I’m gonna go! THREE…TWO…ONE…</p>
<p><strong>fungus</strong>: What in the Christ…was that?</p>
<p><strong>fungus</strong>: Did you plan that? Was all that something
you planned?</p>
<p><strong>fungus</strong>: Because…if that was… Next time you tell me
first.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: He’s out! We got him!</p>
<p><strong>fungus</strong>: What a dope! Maybe they’ll give him another
plane…and we can shoot him down again.</p>
<p><strong>fungus</strong>: What is it? What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>fungus</strong>: Is there something I should know?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Just relax.</p>
<p><strong>fungus</strong>: Is it the plane?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: The plane is fine.</p>
<p><strong>fungus</strong>: Is it you?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Yeah, I guess it is. We did it! We did
it…Damn! We sure did it!</p>
<p><strong>slider</strong>: We’re low on fuel, Ice.</p>
<p><strong>ice</strong>: I know. I know….Aw hell, let’s do it!</p>
<p><strong>fungus</strong>: You’re not supposed to…</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: But I have to!</p>
<p><strong>fungus</strong>: Then…shit! Go ahead. I’m right behind
you.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Who is that guy?</p>
<p><strong>admiral</strong>: Mitchell…</p>
<p><strong>xo</strong>: …Likes to break at 600, ’stead of 300 knots. The
Air Boss hates him. One time, he came over the deck at two hundred,
shakes the shit out of the bridge. Lifted Johnson right off his
feet.</p>
<p><strong>admiral</strong>: Johnson!</p>
<p><strong>air boss</strong>: Yes, Sir, Admiral?</p>
<p><strong>admiral</strong>: Give him his flyby.</p>
<p><strong>air boss</strong>: Goddamn that guy!”</p>
<p><strong>ice</strong>: I guess I owe you one.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: You don’t owe me anything. We’re on the
same team.</p>
<p><strong>ice</strong>: You saved our lives. You did it!</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: We did it.</p>
<p><strong>ice</strong>: You’re a hell of a flyer. You can be my wingman
any time.</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: No. You can be mine!</p>
<p><strong>ice</strong>: Whatever you say, Commander.</p>
<p><strong>fungus</strong>: What happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>wolfman</strong>: He got our radio, and an engine. We were
lucky to make it back.</p>
<p><strong>hollywood</strong>: Not luck. Skill.</p>
<p><strong>stinger</strong>: MiG killers! You name it, boy. Sky’s the
limit. You name it. A medal. Anything you want. Anything.</p>
<p><strong>ice</strong>: MiG killers! What else is there?</p>
<p><strong>fungus</strong>: You hear that? Anything we want.
Anything…Well???</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Well what?</p>
<p><strong>fungus</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: What do I want?</p>
<p><strong>fungus</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>maverick</strong>: Any more MiGs?</p>
<p><strong>stinger</strong>: They don’t seem to want to come up anymore.
There’s nothing on the scopes. In fact, everybody’s denying the incident
ever happened. So…what is it? What do you want?</p>
