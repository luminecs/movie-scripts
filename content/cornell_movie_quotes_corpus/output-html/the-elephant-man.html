<p><strong>#1 daughter</strong>: Poppa!</p>
<p><strong>#2 daughter</strong>: Poppa… may we go in there?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Alright… Your turn.</p>
<p><strong>#2 daughter</strong>: Oh,look M-ummy! Elephants!</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Oh, elephants! We’ll go see them.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: You won’t be long?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: I’ll join you shortly.</p>
<p><strong>older man</strong>: A wicked birth…</p>
<p><strong>barker</strong>: Ladies and Gentlemen, his lungs are larger
than this mammoth blacksmith’s bellows. So great is his power of
exhalation, rivaling even that of the Great North Wind, that he will now
challenge two grown men to attempt to hold the bellows shut as he
applies the mighty blast of his herculean breath! Are there any
volunteers?</p>
<p><strong>barker</strong>: Ah! I see two likely lads! Come forward!
Come forward! Pit your strength against the Mighty Wind- Man!</p>
<p><strong>barker</strong>: Gentlemen… Are you ready?</p>
<p><strong>the lads</strong>: Yes we are… Right… etc.</p>
<p><strong>barker</strong>: Ladies and Gentlemen!… Let the demonstration
begin!!</p>
<p><strong>barker</strong>: Ladies and Gentlemen!… “THE</p>
<p><strong>bobbies</strong>: Make way! Make way!</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Oh yes they are, they’re yours alright.</p>
<p><strong>skeleton man</strong>: I refuse to believe it! I will not
accept it! Those babies are simply too ugly, they cannot be mine!</p>
<p><strong>skeleton man</strong>: I don’t want them! Get rid of them! I
don’t want to see them!</p>
<p><strong>fat lady</strong>: Darling, don’t be difficult! Let’s take
our sweet lovely children on an outing.</p>
<p><strong>skeleton man</strong>: We’ll take these miserable whelps on
an outing, alright! We’ll take them to the zoo… WHERE THEY WILL
STAY!</p>
<p><strong>fat lady</strong>: Children save yourselves! Prevail upon
your Pappa!</p>
<p><strong>dwarves</strong>: Poppa! Poppa! Poppa, please!</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: This is too much! They should not allow it!
They should not allow it!</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Beast, Beast…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: No! That’s right out! Drop the curtain!</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: You can’t do that! I’ve got my rights!</p>
<p><strong>alderman</strong>: I have the authority to close you down,
and I’m doing just that!</p>
<p><strong>alderman</strong>: This exhibit degrades all who see it, as
well as the poor creature himself.</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: He’s a freak! How else can he live?</p>
<p><strong>alderman</strong>: Freaks are one thing. No one objects to
freaks, but this is entirely different. This is monstrous, and ought not
to be allowed. These officers will see to it that you are on your way as
soon as possible. Good day.</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: …Movin’ again!</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: Have a care, guv’nor.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Forgive me…</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: How long has this man been here?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Three quarters of an hour.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Mmmm. Hodges, Pierce come closer. Mr. Hill,
take hold of the rope please. It’s a machine accident. I expect you’ll
be seeing a good deal of this.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Abominable things these machines. One can’t
reason with them.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: What a mess.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: What got you into medicine, Hodges?</p>
<p><strong>hodges</strong>: My father, sir. He’s built quite a
successful practice. I hope to take it over one day.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Is that your case as well, Pierce?</p>
<p><strong>pierce</strong>: Yes sir. Though of course I do have a great
desire to help my fellowman.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Of course you do realize that medicine has
changed quite a bit since your father’s time. In those days we didn’t
even wash our coats. In fact, the sign of a truly accomplished surgeon–
was his black operating coat, so stiff with dried blood and pus that it
could stand up by itself in the corner. I’ve still got mine upstairs…
You don’t mind blood, do you?</p>
<p><strong>hodges &amp; pierce</strong>: Oh no, sir.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Good, that’s one thing we’ve always plenty
of.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Excuse me, Mr. Treves, sir.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: I found it.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Did you see it?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: I’ll be with you in a moment …</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: I say Freddie, what are you about?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Oh nothing… nothing of any great
importance.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Do you know where the proprietor is?</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: He’s not a peeler…</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: No, I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: No… I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Are you the proprietor?</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: And who might you be, sir?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Just one of the curious. I’d like to see
it.</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: I don’t think so. No sir, we’re closed.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: I’d pay handsomely for a private showing.
Are you the proprietor?</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: Handsomely?… Who sent you?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Pardon me?</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: Never mind. I’m the owner.</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: Here we are sir. Life is full of surprises.
Ladies and gentlemen, consider the fate of this creature’s poor mother.
In the fourth month of her maternal condition, she was struck down by a
wild elephant Struck down, if you take my meaning, on an uncharted
African isle. The result is plain to see ladies and gentlemen… THE
TERRIBLE ELEPHANT</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: Stand up!</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Stand up!</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: Turn around!</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Turn around! Turn around!</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: So you’ll bring him to me, tomorrow, 10:00
a.m.? Mr…?</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He’ll be there.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: I’ll send a cab. Here is my card.</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: Now we got a deal… We understand each other…
guv. We understand each other completely.</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: Don’t just stand there. Help him up.</p>
<p><strong>cabman</strong>: Not at all, sir. My… pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: I’ll be in my rooms, Mothershead. I’m not to
be disturbed.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Come with me, please.</p>
<p><strong>matron</strong>: You heard the doctor… Go on.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: My name is Frederick Treves… I am a surgeon
here at the London Hospital, and I lecture in anatomy at the Medical
College… I would very much like to examine you. Would that be all
right?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Ah… yes. Um, first I would like to ask you a
few questions, would that be all right?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Good. Now, let’s see. Your Owner… um, the
man who… who looks after you tells me that you are English and your name
is John Merrick. Is that correct?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Do you know where you were born? Where you
come from?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: I tell you what, I’ll ask you a question,
and you shake your head like this for “no” and nod like this for “yes”,
alright? Do you understand?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Are you in any pain?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Um, no. Just nod your head like this for
“yes” and shake it like this for “no”. Now, are you in any pain?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Are your parents still alive?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Do you understand? Are they dead? Your
father… your mother?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Freddie, what you doing for… I say do open a
window in here or…</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Oh, I’m dreadfully sorry, I had no idea that… I
say!</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Good Lord, Freddie! What have you got in
there?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: You’ll know presently. At the meeting of the
society. But until then, I beg of you Fox, keep it to yourself.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Certainly, if you insist. You must have quite a
find there.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: I don’t know what I’ve got.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Nothing of any importance, eh?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: I’ll tell you this much, Fox, it’s beyond
anything you or I have ever dealt with. Keep it to yourself, please.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Come sit down.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Sit… down.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: I think I’ll examine you now. I’ll save the
questions for later… Will you take off your hat now, please?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Don’t be frightened, I simply want to look
at you. Do you understand?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: That’s right, don’t be frightened. Don’t be
frightened.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Are you ready?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: He is English, he is twenty-one years of age
and his name is John Merrick. Gentlemen, in the course of my profession
I have come upon lamentable deformities of the face due to injury or
disease, as well as mutilations and contortions of the body, depending
upon like causes; but, at no time have I met with such a dreaded or
perverted version of a human being as this man. I wish to draw your
attention to the insidious conditions affecting this patient. Note, if
you will, the extreme enlargement of the skull… and upper limb, which is
totally useless. The alarming curvature of the spine… Turn him, please…
the looseness of the skin, and the varying fibrous tumors that cover 90%
of the body.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: …And there is every indication that these
afflictions have been in existence, and have progressed rapidly, since
birth. The Patient also suffers from chronic bronchitis. As an
interesting side-note, in spite of the afore-mentioned anomalies, the
patient’s genitals remain entirely intact and unaffected.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: So then, gentlemen, owing to this series of
deformities: The congenital exostoses of the skull; extensive
papillomatous growths and large pendulous masses in connection with the
skin; the great enlargement of the right upper limb, involving all the
bones; the massive distortion of the head and the extensive areas
covered by papillomatous growth, the patient has been called, “The
Elephant Man.”</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Hmm?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Hmm?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: It’s been a long day for everyone.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Oh, yes, you’ll need a cab… Stay.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Come with me.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: You never mentioned his mental state.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: He’s imbecile, no doubt from birth. He
speaks, but… it’s all gibberish. No, the man’s a homeless idiot… I pray
God he’s an idiot.</p>
<p><strong>the first</strong>: Quite a coup, Freddie. You’ll look
splendid in the journal.</p>
<p><strong>the second</strong>: Where ever did you find that
creature?</p>
<p><strong>the third</strong>: It’s a pity.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: I pity the poor cab driver, myself.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Did it go well, darling?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Yes, very well, I think. Are the girls in
bed?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you
like your sherry now?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: No, I think a whiskey.</p>
<p><strong>bytes</strong>: Belt up, you misbegotten garbage. How can I
eat with that?</p>
<p><strong>bytes</strong>: How can I eat with THAT?</p>
<p><strong>bytes</strong>: Out of my sight!</p>
<p><strong>bytes</strong>: You clumsy sod!</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Bytes! DON’T…</p>
<p><strong>bytes</strong>: This won’t do, my lad. This just won’t
do!</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Our man is sick. Come right away.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Like this.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: I’ll get my bag.</p>
<p><strong>bytes</strong>: What did you do to him? He’s been like this
all night!</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>bytes</strong>: He was fine when he left here, and now look
at him.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: I intend to.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>bytes</strong>: He fell. He falls.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: He must have taken quite a fall.</p>
<p><strong>bytes</strong>: He’s a clumsy git. Never watches where he is
going.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Why is he sitting up like this? He needs
rest.</p>
<p><strong>bytes</strong>: That’s the way he sleeps. If he lays down,
he’ll die. Head’s too heavy.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: This man belongs in hospital.</p>
<p><strong>bytes</strong>: Can’t you fix him up here? …He’s my
livelihood. Listen.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: You listen, you’re not going to have much of
a livelihood if this man dies. He’s got the rale, he’s very weak, and I
don’t know how much damage has been done by his “fall”. Now stop wasting
time and fetch a cab.</p>
<p><strong>bytes</strong>: I really appreciate this, guv. You know,
there’s lot of things that I can do for you. I move in the proper
circles, for this type of thing…</p>
<p>****: In fact, anything at all, if you take my meaning.</p>
<p><strong>bytes</strong>: I like doing business with you. You and I
understand each other, completely. I know I can trust you. Can’t I?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Everything will be seen to.</p>
<p><strong>mothershead</strong>: Nora! Mind your duties… if you don’t
concentrate dear, you’ll only make more work for the rest of us. Now,
get about your business. …and do get your collar straight, dear.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I’m so sorry, Mrs. Mothershead.</p>
<p><strong>mothershead</strong>: Do get on with it, Nora.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: I don’t know if you will understand this,
but you will never go back to that man again. You’re safe now. No one
will ever harm you. Do you understand?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Breakfasting with the patients this morning,
Mr. Treves?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: It’s for a patient.</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: Mr. Treves, come over here a moment, won’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: Good morning, Treves.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Good morning, sir.</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: You’ve acquired a taste for this?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: It’s quite nutritious, sir.</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: Don’t be mad. This muck can kill you.</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: Take this up, to to the man in the isolation
ward when you have a moment, won’t you?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Don’t be frightened. He won’t hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: Indeed!</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: A hospital is no place for secrecy,
Mr. Treves. Doctors spiriting hooded figures about are liable to cause
comment. Why wasn’t this patient properly admitted, and why is he in
isolation? Is he contagious?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: No sir, he’s got bronchitis and he’s been
badly beaten.</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: Why isn’t he in the General Ward, then?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Well sir, he’s quite seriously deformed, and
I fear the other patients would find him… rather shocking.</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: Deformed? Is that it. Then am I to assume that
he is ultimately incurable?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: What are your plans then, Treves… You are
aware that the London does not accept incurables. The rules are quite
clear on that point.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Yes, I’m well aware of that. But this case
is quite exceptional.</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: Oh, is he a friend of yours?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: No, more of an acquaintance.</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: I certainly sympathize with your problem,
Treves… Why don’t you try the British Home, or the Royal Hospital for
perhaps they would have a place for him.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Yes sir, I’ll look into that. Would you like
to meet him sir?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Excuse me, sir.</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: The Elephant Man?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: I’m sorry, my dear, I should have warned
you. I’m so terribly sorry, please forgive me. There, you’re alright
now. Go downstairs and please ask Mrs. Mothershead to come up. Tell her
to knock on the door and wait for me. Alright?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Yes Sir. I’m sorry, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: I’m very sorry about that. Are you resting
well?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Ah good. Well then… oh yes, we’ll have to
get you some more food. I’m sure you must be simply famished. Hmm?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Of course you are. Now then, I think you’ll
be quite comfortable up here for awhile. I’ll see to it you have
everything you need, and, uh… yes.</p>
<p><strong>other nurses</strong>: Did you see him?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>other nurses</strong>: What’s wrong with him?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Ah, Mothershead. How are you feeling
today?</p>
<p><strong>mothershead</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Good. Excellent. Now then, Mrs. Mothershead,
I want you to come into this room with me. Inside there is a man with a
rather… unfortunate appearance.</p>
<p><strong>mothershead</strong>: I’ve heard.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Yes… Well, I want you to clear up a little
mess, a breakfast tray was spilt. And bring up another breakfast. When
you’ve done that, you and I shall give the man a bath. But, Mothershead,
I’m counting on your many years of experience to get you through this,
Above all, do not scream, do not cry out, or in any way show this man
that you are frightened of him…</p>
<p><strong>mothershead</strong>: Sir, you don’t have to worry about me.
I’m not the sort to cry out. Shall we go in?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Yes… Yes, let’s go in.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: I would like you to meet Mrs. Mothershead -
Mrs. Mothershead, Mr. John Merrick.</p>
<p><strong>mothershead</strong>: How do you do?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: The disease is shocking.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: I wonder how far it can go before it…</p>
<p><strong>mothershead</strong>: Sit still. Don’t wiggle about like a
pup. I won’t stand for any foolishness.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: It’s pretty certain that if he had the
disease as a child, he was abandoned. But in that case, he’d have to
have had care. The very fact that he’s alive bears that out… But,
where?</p>
<p><strong>mothershead</strong>: The workhouse.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Yes! The workhouse!</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: The workhouse.</p>
<p><strong>night porter</strong>: What’s all this, then?</p>
<p><strong>young porter</strong>: Mr. Treves is scrubbing his Elephant
Man.</p>
<p><strong>night porter</strong>: Elephant Man?</p>
<p><strong>young porter</strong>: Yeah… I hear it’s a real horror. Even
made Mothershead scream.</p>
<p><strong>night porter</strong>: Friend of the night, eh? The Elephant
Man. I think I’ll have me a look at that.</p>
<p><strong>night porter</strong>: Now, you need the scrubbing,
ducks!</p>
<p><strong>night porter</strong>: Hush, love, I told you before one word
from me, they’ll toss you back on the street, and then those pretty
little arms of yours will never grow straight. Now close your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>night porter</strong>: Here he is, the old fiend of the
night, the terror of the London. Let’s have a look at you. Let’s see
what makes ’em scream…</p>
<p><strong>night porter</strong>: Cor Blimey!</p>
<p><strong>night porter</strong>: So this is the Elephant Man. I ain’t
never seen nothing like you before. What the bleedin’ hell happened to
you?</p>
<p><strong>night porter</strong>: Oh… dumb, eh?</p>
<p><strong>night porter</strong>: Good. I likes people what can keep
quiet.</p>
<p><strong>night porter</strong>: Like a drink? Go on… Go on have some.
No? You should try being more sociable, mate.</p>
<p><strong>night porter</strong>: You and I are going to be good
friends, we are. And, I’ve got lots of friends who I know would like to
meet you. And they will, mate… they will.</p>
<p><strong>night porter</strong>: Welcome to the London.</p>
<p><strong>milkman</strong>: Here early again, eh Mr. Treves? If you
don’t mind my saying so, sir, with your early habits, you’d ’a made a
fine milkman.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Good morning, Charley. I’ll keep that in
mind!</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Mr. Merrick?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: ….Good morning… John. I’ve brought your
breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: What are you doing down there? Come up John,
come up on the bed. The cold floor is bad for you. I won’t hurt you,
come on now…</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: You must eat. We must keep your
strength…</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: …What on earth is the matter with you?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Now please, John, you must do as I say. Come
up from there.</p>
<p><strong>mothershead</strong>: Good morning, Mr. Treves. It’ll be his
bath-time soon. Has he eaten?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Not quite yet, Mrs. Mothershead. There seems
to be some difficulty this morning.</p>
<p><strong>mothershead</strong>: Won’t come out, eh?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: No, he’s very upset about something.</p>
<p><strong>mothershead</strong>: Just being obstinate, sir. I’ll handle
it.</p>
<p><strong>mothershead</strong>: Alright, my son, none of this fuss.
Come up from there, this instant.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: No! Don’t pull at him like that. We don’t
want to frighten him more than he already is.</p>
<p><strong>mothershead</strong>: Honestly, sir, you must be very firm
with this sort. Otherwise they’d lay about on the floor gibbering all
day long. All he understands is a good smack.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: He’s had his share of “smacks”, Mothershead.
I expect that’s what drives him under the bed. We must use patience and
understanding with this man.</p>
<p><strong>mothershead</strong>: Perhaps you’ve got the time for that,
Mr. Treves, I certainly don’t. I’ve got an entire hospital to look
after, and you have your real patients. Don’t waste your time with him
sir, it’s like talking to a wall. I don’t mean to be harsh, but
truthfully what can you do for him? I’ll be back later for his bath. And
Mr. Carr Gomm would like to see you when you have a moment. Good day
sir.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: What good am I to you…?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: …What is my purpose? …It’s so important that
I understand you. I want to help you, I want to be your doctor… but I
can’t help you unless you help me, unless I know what you are feeling. I
believe there’s something back there, there’s something you want to say,
but I’ve got to understand you. Do you understand me?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: No! You are going to talk to me! We are
going to show them! We’re going to show them that you’re not a wall. We
are going to talk! Do you understand? Nod your head if you understand
me!</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: You do understand me! You understand. Now
you’re going to say it. I’ve got to hear how you say things. Now, very
slowly, say “yes.”</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: “Yes.”</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Yyyy… Yyye… yyyess.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Yes John!</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: …Yyes</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Yyyess.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Yyess.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: That’s much better. I could understand that
“yes”.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Very good! Oh yes! Now listen. I’m going to
say some things to you and I want you to repeat them… um… I want you to
say them back to me. Do you understand? I’m going to say some things to
you and I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Excellent! Now, say… “Hello”</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Hello…</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: My name is…</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: My… name is…</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: John Merrick.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: John… Merrick</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Say “Merrick”.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Merrick…</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Say “Mmmerrick.”</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Mmmerrick.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Say “Mmmerrick.”</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Mmmerrick.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Well, that’s alright. I understand you. Now,
say the whole thing again, Hello …</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Hello… my name is… John Merrick.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Oh, Mrs. Mothershead, please forgive my
behavior yesterday. I’m sorry if you’re having to do extra work on my
account. It was just seeing it…</p>
<p><strong>mothershead</strong>: Patients here are not “its”. They are
either “he’s” or “she’s”, but that’s alright, Ireland. This one’s going
to be more work for all of us. Good God girl! Mind your broth.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Why, my dear Mrs. Mothershead, how good of
you to join us. Mr. Merrick, will you please introduce yourself?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Hello, my name is John Merrick.</p>
<p><strong>mothershead</strong>: Good Lord, Mr. Treves!</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: We’ve made tremendous strides today,
Mothershead. He listens and repeats with great attention, and this
certainly isn’t easy for him.</p>
<p><strong>mothershead</strong>: Parrots can do as much, Mr. Treves.
It’s all very nice, but I don’t see the point. You know they won’t let
him stay here.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: I’m sure that if Mr. Merrick made a good
impression on the hospital committee they’d see that he’s the exception
to their rule. Now I’m not expecting miracles. I’m not saying he’ll be
able to read or write, but I do think that I can get him to speak for
himself. I’m going to arrange things with Carr Gomm right now. That was
very good, John, very good. That’s all for today. We shall do some more
tomorrow. Mothershead?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: I’ll see you soon.</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: Ah, Treves…</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: Have you contacted the British Home and the
Royal Hospital?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Ah, no sir. I had planned to see them in the
morning.</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: Good! How is the patient?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: He’s doing very well. In fact that’s why I
came to see you. I think that if I were to present Mr. Merrick to the
hospital committee, then they would have a chance to see for themselves
not only the extraordinary nature of the disease, but of the man as
well. If the committee had a chance to speak with him, hear him say a
few words for himself, I’m sure they would see him as a patient, rather
than as a violation of the rules.</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: A few words? I thought he was imbecile?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Well sir, perhaps I should explain…</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: I really don’t think that’s necessary Treves.
I’m quite sure the committee will be able to make an equitable decision
on the merits of the case, such as they are.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: I don’t agree. No one can make a reasonable
decision about this man’s future without at least meeting him. No doctor
would presume to diagnose a patient he had never met.</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: No, Treves, it’s out of the question. Now if
it was up to me, I’d say “Certainly, let’s meet the fellow, by all
means,” I’m sorry, I simply can’t speak for the other members of the
committee.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Then will you meet him, as a representative
of the committee.</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: Mr. Treves, it’s out of the question. I want
to hear as soon as possible what the other hospitals can do. I’m
sorry.</p>
<p><strong>bytes</strong>: I want my man back.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Just a moment, how did you get in here?</p>
<p><strong>bytes</strong>: Never mind that, I want my man!</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: He’s still very sick. Please come downstairs
with me. I’ll explain the situation.</p>
<p><strong>bytes</strong>: DON’T… Don’t muck me about. You’ve had plenty
of time to fix him up, and he’s leaving with me, NOW. Do you understand
me? Now, Mr. Treves. We had a bargain!</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: You misunderstood. This man suffered a
severe fall, if you take my meaning. He’s my patient now and I must do
what…</p>
<p><strong>bytes</strong>: Pull the other one, why don’t you! We made a
deal!</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: I know what you’ve done to him and he’s
never going back to that.</p>
<p><strong>bytes</strong>: He’s a freak! That’s how they live. We’re
partners, him and I, business partners. You’re willfully deprivin’ me of
my livlihood!</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: All you do is profit from another man’s
misery!</p>
<p><strong>bytes</strong>: You think you’re better ’n me? YOU wanted the
freak to show all your doctor chums and make a name for yourself, you
guv. So I gave him to you. On trust, in the name of science! And now I
want him back.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: You don’t own this man!</p>
<p><strong>bytes</strong>: I want him back!</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: So you can beat him? So you can starve him?
A dog in the street would fare better with you!</p>
<p><strong>bytes</strong>: I’ve got my rights, damn you, and I’m going
to the authorities!</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: Well, go to the authorities…</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: By all means do so. In fact, I’ll fetch them
myself. I’m quite sure they’d be very interested in your story, as well
as ours.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Now I think we really do understand one
another.</p>
<p><strong>bytes</strong>: Right… Right.</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: Singularly unpleasant chap… uh… I don’t
suppose there would be any harm in my meeting your… patient,
Mr. Treves.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Thank you very much Sir. Shall we say in a
few days then?</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: Shall we say two o’clock tomorrow
afternoon?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Wh… whatever is most convenient for you,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: Two o’clock then… you know Treves… It seems
this acquaintance of yours has become rather more than just an
acquaintance.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: …Yes, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Two o’clock?</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: Elephant Man? I don’t want to meet an Elephant
Man.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Freddie?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Freddie?… Freddie, don’t look so
discouraged.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: I shouldn’t be. We made great progress
today. I taught him to repeat a few basic phrases. He did rather well,
too, but I had to lead him every step of the way. Though frankly, at
times I was unsure of who was leading whom.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Well, I wasn’t sure whether he was parroting
me because that’s all he was capable of, or whether he sensed that
that’s all I wanted to hear, and he was trying to please me.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: But I thought you said that he was rather…
simple?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: He is. I mean, I’ve always thought he was. I
think he must be. Is he simple? Or is that just something I’ve wished
upon him to make things simpler for myself?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Frederick, why are you so interested in this
particular case?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: I don’t know. I can’t explain it. If this is
an intelligent man, trapped in the body of a monster, then I’m under a
moral obligation to help free that mind, free that spirit as best I can,
to help him live as full and content a life as possible. But! If he’s an
imbecile, who’s body I can’t treat and who’s mind I can’t touch, well,
then my obligation is discharged. They can put him where they will; he
won’t be bothered, I won’t be bothered, and everyone’s conscience can
remain free and untroubled. And that is my dilemma… what is in his
mind?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Perhaps you’re just polishing a stone,
endowing this Elephant Man with qualities he doesn’t possess?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: And what qualities are those? Intelligence
or stupidity?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I’m sure I don’t know, Freddie.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: I’m sorry… I don’t know either. I just don’t
know.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Well, these things take time.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: I’ve only got until two o’clock tomorrow
afternoon, when Carr Gomm meets him. Somehow, between now and then I’ve
got to make John Merrick at least seem like an intelligent man… Why am I
fooling myself? Nothing short of John delivering the Sermon on the Mount
is going to sway Carr Gomm…</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want,
he maketh me to lie down in green pastures; He leadeth me beside still
waters. He restoreth my soul: He Guideth me in the paths of
righteousness…</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Righteousness…</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Righteousness for his namesake.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Very good, very good. Now, when your visitor
comes today I want you to say it exactly the way you said it just now. I
will introduce him to you and you will say the words you’ve learned. If
you have any trouble with any of the words, I’ll help you. I’m sure
you’ll be just fine. If you do as well for him as you’ve done for me
these last two days, then I’m sure our visitor will be very pleased.
Now, let’s go through the whole thing again, shall we? I will say “May I
introduce you to Mr. Carr Gomm.” And you will say…</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Hello, my name is John Merrick. I am very
pleased to meet you!</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: It’s only a physical problem. He has trouble
with certain sounds because of the constrictive deformity of the mouth.
But he can talk, and has a great eagerness to make contact with people
who will let him. So if you have any difficulty understanding what he is
saying, just tell me and I’ll make it clear.</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: Speaking is one thing, Treves, but can the man
comprehend?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: …As I said, it’s only a physical problem…
but I do feel that Mr. Merrick is very flattered that you’re taking the
time and trouble to meet him, and he’s most anxious to make a good
impression, so he might seem rather nervous.</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: He needn’t. I have no desire to cause him any
discomfort. Did you make those inquiries we spoke about?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Yes, I spoke to both the British Home and
Royal Hospital for Incurables. I’m afraid that they weren’t very
encouraging, but they said they’d bring it up at their next committee
meeting, so we should have their answers shortly.</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: Fine, fine. You know, your dedication to this
patient is an inspiring thing, Treves. But you must remember that this
is a hospital, and there are many patients here. Patients who can be
made well, and you owe them your first consideration. Just don’t become
so obsessed, old man, that you begin to neglect them.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: John, may I introduce you to Sir Carr
Gomm.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Hello… my name is John Merrick. I am very
pleased to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: I’m very… pleased to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: How are you feeling today?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: I feel much better. Thank you for asking.
And you?</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: I’m feeling very fit, thank you. How is your
bronchitis?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: I feel much better. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: Are you comfortable here?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Everyone has been very kind. I am extremely
grateful.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Mr. Merrick likes the food here. Don’t you
John?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Oh yes! It is much better than what I am
used to.</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: Oh yes?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: And what was that, John?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Potatoes…</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: …Yes potatoes… but…</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: But the variety of food here is very
pleasing… I commend you.</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: I understand that you were beaten?</p>
<p><strong>dierrick</strong>: Oh no, everyone has been very kind.</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: No, I meant in your former situation.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: I’m feeling much better now…</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: Tell me, how do you like Mr. Treves? As a
teacher?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: …I… everyone has been very kind to me.</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: Of course. How long did you and Mr. Treves
prepare for this interview?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: …everyone has been very kind.</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: Yes, of course… Well, it’s been a pleasure
meeting you, Mr. Merrick. Good day.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Thank you, John. You did very well.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures…</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: It was a nice try, Treves, but the man is so
obviously mouthing your words.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Yes, I’m very sorry to have wasted your
time, sir. I just felt that I had to do anything I could to protect
him.</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: I’m sorry too. He simply doesn’t belong here.
He’s be much happier somewhere else, where he could be constantly looked
after. Believe me, Frederick, it’s better that it worked out this way.
Good day.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Yea, though I walk through the valley of
the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me; Thy rod
and Thy staff, they comfort me…</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: What is it, Treves?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Thou preparest a table before me in the
presence of mine enemies, Thou anointest my head with oil…</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: I didn’t teach him that part!</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: My cup runneth over. Surely goodness and
loving kindness shall follow me all the days of my life, and I shall
dwell in the house of the Lord forever.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: How did you, know the rest? I never taught
you the rest of it.</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Tell me, John, how did you know the rest of
the 23rd Psalm?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: I… I used to read the Bible every day. I
know it very well. The Bible, and the Book of Common Prayer. The 23rd
Psalm is very beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: It was a great pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Merrick.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: I am very pleased to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: I hope we can talk together again sometime.
Good day.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: I want to see you in my office as soon as
you’re through up here. We’ve a good deal to discuss.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Of course, sir. Thank you, thank you very
much.</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: Treves. Well done.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Not me, sir. Mr. Merrick. He succeeded in
spite of my shortsightedness.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Why did you let me go on like that, teaching
you what you already knew? Why didn’t you tell me you could read?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: You did not ask me.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: I never thought to ask. How can you ever
forgive me?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Oh, no do not say that. You have been so
kind to me. I was afraid to say too much. People always want me to be
quiet. You wanted me to speak, but I was afraid. Forgive me.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: We do have a lot to talk about, don’t
we?</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: Can you imagine what his life has been
like?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Yes, I think I can.</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: No you can’t. You can’t begin to know, no one
can.</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: You are quite right, Treves, this is an
exceptional case. And I quite agree that the committee should see
Mr. Merrick.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: I could easily arrange…</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: No, not that way. Broadneck and the others
don’t like to deal with patients directly. It makes them queasy… Do you
have any photographs of Mr. Merrick?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Well, yes.</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: Excellent. We shall present them, along with
the other particulars of the case to the committee. I want them to see,
exactly, how horribly his body has been affected. You and I shall vouch
for his inner qualities.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Do you think they’ll go along with us?</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: Of course they will. They’re reasonable
men.</p>
<p><strong>mothershead</strong>: Read it.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Thou heardest my voice; hide not thine ear
at my breathing, At my cry.</p>
<p><strong>mothershead</strong>: Credit where credit is due. You’ll have
the paper every morning at breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>night porter</strong>: I hear you have some trouble
sleepin’…</p>
<p><strong>night porter</strong>: Head’s too heavy, eh?</p>
<p><strong>night porter</strong>: And I heard a nasty rumor about you; I
heard you can talk but you can’t, can you… can you… can you?…</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Noooo!</p>
<p><strong>night porter</strong>: No… No you can’t! One word about me
out of that stinking cakehole… Just ONE word, and you’ll have no trouble
at sleepin’… no trouble at all. You understand me? Do you!!</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Yyyesss.</p>
<p><strong>night porter</strong>: There now, that’s better, i’n’ it?</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: As far as I can see, the only obstacle might
be Broadneck. He has enormous influence over the others, very old
school, not an easy man to impress. In any case, if worse does come to
worse, we still have the British and Royal Homes to fall back on, don’t
we.</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: Don’t we?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: No, we don’t. Their committees have informed
me that they’re unwilling to take Mr. Merrick, even if they were
supplied with funds. They don’t want him.</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: Well, it’s up to us then, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: Don’t worry Treves, we’ll make them see it our
way.</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: They’ve eyes, haven’t they?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: …Due to the progressive nature of the
disease, I feel sure that the patient does not have much longer to
live.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Forgive the redundancy, gentlemen, but there
is no other place for him. Both the Royal Hospital and the British Home
have turned him down even if sufficient funds for his care were
provided. The workhouse is certainly out of the question. The patient
has an overwhelming fear of returning to the horrors of his past. His
appearance is so disturbing that all shrink from him. He cannot, in
justice to others, be put in the general ward of the workhouse. The
police rightly prevent his being exhibited, and he is mobbed in the
streets wherever he goes. What is to be done with him?</p>
<p><strong>broadneck</strong>: I, for one, am sick and tired of this
competitive freak-hunting by these overly ambitious young doctors,
trying to make names for themselves. To parade then about in front of
the pathological society is one thing, but to waste this committee’s
valuable time with requests for shelter for these abominations of nature
is quite another.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Gentlemen, John Merrick is not an animal, he
is a man, fully aware of his condition. An intelligent, sensitive,
literate man, with an intimate knowledge of the Bible. His horrible
infirmities do not reduce him to anything less than what he is, a man;
and it would be criminal if we of the London Hospital, his final refuge,
the last place on earth where this man can find peace, were to cast him
out.</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: Gentlemen, may I make a suggestion. There are
two small rooms off Bedstead Square that are no longer in use and would
be admirably suited to Mr. Merrick’s needs. I also propose to write a
letter to The Times, appealing to their readers for assistance. Knowing
the generosity of the British public, I feel we would have little
trouble in raising the funds for his maintenance. Indeed, this
hospital’s rules do preclude the admission of incurables, but if ever
there was an exception to the rule, it is this patient. So therefore, I
propose, if Mr. Treves is finished, that we put it to a vote. All those
in favor of keeping Mr. Merrick here?</p>
<p><strong>broadneck</strong>: One moment, as far as I’m concerned this
creature has no business being in our hospital. I think Mr. Carr Gomm’s
letter would be an excellent idea, and when you appeal for funds, I
think you should appeal for a more appropriate place for him as well. I
agree the British public is generous, and I’m sure that somewhere the
creature will find a happy and permanent home, but not here.</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: I see. All, then, that move we keep
Mr. Merrick here?</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: All those opposed?</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>broadneck</strong>: Well then. In the meantime, of course, he
needn’t be turned out. He may stay in the rooms off Bedstead Square
until such time as more suitable arrangements can be made, thus freeing
the Isolation Ward for more deserving patients. Well then, Mr. Chairman,
if there is nothing further to discuss, I move that we adjourn this
meeting and all go bout our normal business.</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: I second the motion gentlemen. This meeting is
adjourned.</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: Somehow I don’t think they quite
understand.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: …terrible though his appearance is, so
terrible indeed that women and nervous persons fly in terror from the
sight of him, and that he is debarred from seeking to earn his
livelihood in any ordinary way, yet he is superior in intelligence, can
read and write, is quiet, gentle, not to say even refined in his
mind.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: I’d very much like to meet that gentleman. He
sounds almost Shakespearean.</p>
<p><strong>#1 doctor</strong>: “…in life until he came under the kind
care of the nursing staff of the London Hospital and the surgeon who has
befriended him…”</p>
<p><strong>#2 doctor</strong>: Good publicity for the Hospital, at any
rate.</p>
<p><strong>#3 doctor</strong>: Treves comes off well too, eh
Freddie?</p>
<p><strong>#4 doctor</strong>: It was pleasant of you to join us this
evening, Frederick.</p>
<p><strong>#2 doctor</strong>: Your Elephant Man dining out this
evening?</p>
<p><strong>#4 doctor</strong>: I understand the kitchen ran out of hay
this morning.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Do continue reading, Mr. Stanley, please.</p>
<p><strong>#1 doctor</strong>: “…it is a case of singular affliction
brought about through no fault of himself; he can but hope for quiet and
privacy during a life which Mr. Treves assures me is not likely to be
long,”</p>
<p><strong>#4 doctor</strong>: The Elephant Man. Makes you sound rather
more like a zoo-keeper than a surgeon, Frederick.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Excuse me gentlemen. I seem to have lost my
appetite. Good evening.</p>
<p><strong>#4 doctor</strong>: I say, what’s he on about?</p>
<p><strong>#3 doctor</strong>: He’s getting a bit of a swelled head, if
you ask me.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Well, no one did ask you Atkins. Frederick
Treves is not only the most skillful surgical operator here, he’s also a
humanitarian of the highest order. You sound like a pack of whining
school boys with your petty jealousies.</p>
<p><strong>#3 doctor</strong>: Look here, Fox, I simply said.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Oh belt up!</p>
<p><strong>1st woman</strong>: There are cleaner rooms in the
gasworks.</p>
<p><strong>1st woman</strong>: Who’s all the fuss for, then?</p>
<p><strong>2nd woman</strong>: Don’t you know? It’s for that strange
one.</p>
<p><strong>1st woman</strong>: Mr. Treves’ Elephant Man? I hear he’s got
a trunk.</p>
<p><strong>2nd woman</strong>: Right, right.</p>
<p><strong>2nd woman</strong>: Blimey, now we’re cleanin’ up for circus
animals!</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: “A silent shaft of stone on a deserted
promontory, the lonely Eddystone is a beacon of aid and comfort to
mariners of all nations.”</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Good evening. How are you feeling?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Good evening. Very well, thank you. And
you?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Very well, thank you. I have something for
you, John. I’m sure you’ll enjoy it, it’s very popular.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Thank you… so much… oh it’s beautiful!</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: I came to tell you that I’ll be here early
tomorrow morning. We’re moving you to your permanent home. I’m sure
you’ll be very happy there, John. So get a good night’s rest, there’ll
be new people to meet tomorrow. Good night.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>night porter</strong>: Here… listen to this. This is a letter
to THE London Times from the guvnor of the hospital. There is now in a
little room off one of our attic wards a man named John Merrick, so
dreadful a sight that he is unable even to come out by daylight to the
garden. He has been called The Elephant Man on account of his terrible
deformity…</p>
<p><strong>night porter</strong>: …His appearance is so terrible that
woman and nervous persons fly in terror at the sight of him. …and guess
who can get you tickets to see him? Your own Sunny Jim!</p>
<p><strong>young man in crowd</strong>: Let’s go see him, then!</p>
<p><strong>night porter</strong>: Keep your shirts on. …When the time is
right. Right now he’s in the attic but tomorrow they’re movin’ him into
Bedstead Square, right into my lap… then… for the right price you’ll see
something you’ll never see again in your life.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Workhouse!</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: This is your new home, John.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: This… is my new home?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: The hospital?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Of course! What did you think?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: How long will I stay here?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: I promise you. You will never see the inside
of that horrible place again. You will never, ever go back to the
workhouse… or that man. It’s a splendid room, don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: When I’m next moved may I go to a
lighthouse?… or to a blind-asylum?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Has the response picked up?</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: Frankly, Treves, it’s not what I’d expected. A
few small cheques. Well- wishers. Don’t worry, these things undoubtedly
take time.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: But he’s so afraid he’s going to be carted
off. I’ve promised him that won’t happen.</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: Well… I’ll let you know if there’s something
in the afternoon post.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Please do.</p>
<p><strong>mothershead</strong>: Well, I think I can safely hand the
duties over to you girls now. Mr. Merrick will require a bath every day…
that way he won’t pong quite so much. Nora, you can instruct Kathleen on
the finer points of Mr. Merrick’s bath. You’ll be on your own
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>mothershead</strong>: Don’t look so glum girls. Such
enthusiastic volunteers should be more cheerful.</p>
<p><strong>mothershead</strong>: Oh, and girls, under no circumstances
are there to be any mirrors brought into this room.</p>
<p><strong>kathleen</strong>: He’s… so ugly!</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Ugly or not, you’re going to help me.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Feeling better now, Mr. Merrick?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: You look very nice in your new clothes.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Well, if there is nothing more, I suppose
we’ll be leaving you now.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: No, nothing.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: You look splendid, John.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: When one is invited to tea, one must look
one’s best.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Make yourself comfortable, John.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Come and meet our quest, my love.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: John Merrick, I’d like you to meet my wife,
Anne Treves.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I’m very pleased to meet you, Mr. Merrick.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: I’m very…</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: John… what’s the matter? John… why are you
upset?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: I’m not used to such kindness. From a
beautiful woman.</p>
<p><strong>annne</strong>: Would you like a nice cup of tea,
Mr. Merrick?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Yes… thank you.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Yes, a cup of tea would go nicely.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: John… would you like to see the rest of the
house?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Come with me, John. I’ll show it to you.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Mr. Merrick, sugar?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Yes please, two.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: One or two?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Two, please.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: John loves the house.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Do you?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Oh yes. You have so many nice things, and
so much room.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Oh?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Yes, we do have a lot of room. But you
should see the place on weekends, when I see patients here. Sometimes
there are so many, we have to set them down wherever we can. In fact,
Mrs. Treves sometimes says that the only room she can call her own is
the bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Well, it’s a lovely bedroom. What do you
call that thing above the bed?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: That’s a canopy, John.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Ohhh…</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: How is your tea, John?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: It’s very good. I’m enjoying my visit with
you very much. It’s so very kind of you to have me as a guest in your
home. I’m sorry I made a spectacle of myself.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Not at all, John.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: I love the way you’ve arranged your
pictures on the mantlepiece. Is that the way it’s done in most
houses?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Oh yes.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Who are they of?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Oh, our relatives… the children.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: The children! May I see?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: The Children. Where are your children</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Oh, they’re gone for the day… with
friends.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Friends. Ah yes, friends! How nice.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: And here is one of Frederick’s mother.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: How lovely.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: And here are my mother and father.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: They have noble faces.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I’ve always thought that myself.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Oh, yes.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Would you… would you like to see my
mother?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Your mother?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Oh… why Mr. Merrick she’s beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: She has the face of an angel… She was an
angel. She was so kind… so kind to me. It’s not her fault, for in the
fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an
elephant. I’m sure I must have been a great disappointment to her.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as loving as
you are could ever be a disappointment.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: If only I could find her. If only she could
see me now, here, with such lovely kind friends. You, Mrs. Treves, and
you, Mr. Treves. Then maybe she would love me as I am. I’ve tried to
hard to be good.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Please… please…</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Good morning, Mr. Merrick.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: What is this that you’re doing?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: What? Oh! I see! It’s St. Phillips. Oh, of
course. Why… why that’s very good, I mean you’ve gotten the windows and
arches just right.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: But it’s so good, I mean… it’s so very
good.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Thank you… very much.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Where did you get this box?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: The hallway? Oh, the wastecan!</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: I meant no harm, it was the only place
where I could find cardboard. I thought it has been thrown away.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: It’s alright, it was thrown away. No one wants
it. It’s just that it’s a little dirty, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: The main spire.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: The… oh, the spire! How silly of me, it’s as
plain as day… Mr. Merrick, where did you learn to do this?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: …I learned a long time ago.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Oh, but how will you finish it? You haven’t
any more cardboard.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: I’ll have to find some more.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Yes… well, good day, Mr. Merrick.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Good morning, John.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: John, there’s someone here who would like to
meet you. Would that be alright?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: John, I’d like you to meet one of the
brightest lights of the British stage, Mrs. Kendal. Mrs. Kendal, John
Merrick.</p>
<p><strong>kendal</strong>: Good day, Mr. Merrick.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Good day…!</p>
<p><strong>kendal</strong>: I’ve brought you some things. I hope you’ll
like, Mr. Merrick. I hope you don’t think it too forward.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Oh, no.</p>
<p><strong>kendal</strong>: I knew you’d understand. Here.</p>
<p><strong>kendal</strong>: I want you to know that I don’t go about
giving my pictures to just anyone.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Oh, no. I would never think it! It’s so
beautiful. You are so… I’ll give it a place of honor, here, next to my
mother.</p>
<p><strong>kendal</strong>: She’s very pretty, your mother.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Mr. Treves says that you are in the
theatre. Do you live there?</p>
<p><strong>kendal</strong>: Oh no, Mr. Merrick. I just work there.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Well, even to work there would be
wonderful. Is it beautiful?</p>
<p><strong>kendal</strong>: You’ve never been?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Alas, no.</p>
<p><strong>kendal</strong>: Well you must go. It is one of the most
beautiful places on earth. Of course, I’m rather partial.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Tell me about it, please!</p>
<p><strong>kendal</strong>: It’s very difficult to put into a nutshell,
but I should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination, where one
may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world, to any time you
desire. You may look over the shoulders of kings, unobserved, battle
with ruthless tyrants, and marry the beautiful princess, all in the
space of a few hours. Onstage you may be whoever you wish to be, do
anything you please, and always, always live happily ever after. The
theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world, Mr. Merrick.
It is lights and music, gaiety and joy. It’s… well, it’s romance.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Romance!</p>
<p><strong>kendal</strong>: That’s one thing the theatre has in great
store. which reminds me. I have something else for you…</p>
<p><strong>kendal</strong>: Have you read it?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: No, but I certainly shall.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Romeo and Juliet. I know of this… “If I
profane with my unworthiest hand, This holy shrine, the gentle fine is
this: My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand, To smooth that rough
touch with a tender kiss.”</p>
<p><strong>kendal</strong>: Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too
much, Which mannerly devotion shows in this; For saints have hands that
pilgrims hands do touch, And palm to palm is holy palmer’s kiss.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Have not saints lips, and holy palmers
too?</p>
<p><strong>kendal</strong>: Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in
prayer.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands
do. They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.</p>
<p><strong>kendal</strong>: Why, Mr. Merrick, you’re not an Elephant Man
at all…</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Oh no?</p>
<p><strong>kendal</strong>: Oh no… no… you’re a Romeo.</p>
<p><strong>bytes</strong>: So, there you are, my boy, my treasure.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Mummy, listen to this!</p>
<p><strong>mummy</strong>: Hush, Jennifer, can’t you see Mummy’s
talking?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: But it’s about Mrs. Kendal, mummy! The actress
you go on so much about!</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: “Mrs. Kendal, always at the forefront of
fashion and form, was seen leaving The London the other afternoon. No,
dear readers, the most facile actress of our day has not been taken ill,
but rather said she was ‘visiting a friend’. And who was the lucky
recipient of this attention? Quick enquiries proved it to be none other
than Mr. John Merrick, The Elephant Man, with whom our readers are
undoubtedly familiar. After a chat of three-quarters of an hour,
Mrs. Kendal was kind enough to leave Mr. Merrick with an autographed
portrait of herself. Owing to a disfigurement of the most extreme
nature, Mr. Merrick has never been properly presented to London society.
But knowing that wherever Mrs. Kendal goes, others inevitably follow,
the questions arises: Will London society present itself to him?”</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Parkins, whose carriage is that?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Well mum, that looks like Alexander, Lord
Waddington’s driver.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Lord and Lady Waddington! Well. Drive back to
the house. I can’t be seen in this.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Thank you for your kind gifts. I can’t say
enough about this ring. And this walking stick is ever so dashing. So
much more elegant than my old one. More tea?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: If you have a chill I can close the
window.</p>
<p><strong>the lady</strong>: Oh no, no, no, I’m fine. Please… I mean,
thank you.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: I don’t get out as often as I’d like to,
for some people DO find my appearance disturbing. Of course, I can’t
fault them.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: People are often frightened by what they
don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: And it is hard to understand, even for
myself, for you see, Mother was so very beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: How’s your tea?</p>
<p><strong>mothershead</strong>: Watery headed bunch.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: I regret that I must leave you here, m’
Lord, m’ Lady. Thank you so much for coming. It was an act of the
greatest charity.</p>
<p><strong>lady waddington</strong>: Oh no, Mr. Treves, the pleasure was
all ours. Good day.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Incredible, isn’t it? Well, I think John has
had enough visitors for one day, Mothershead. I’ve got a lecture at the
college, I’ll be back this evening.</p>
<p><strong>mothershead</strong>: Excuse me, sir. I’d like to have a word
with you.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Oh?… Well, quickly please, Mothershead, I’m
overdue.</p>
<p><strong>mothershead</strong>: I can’t understand why you let those
people go in there, sir.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Now Mothershead, you have to understand that
this is very good for John. He relishes contact with people outside the
hospital…</p>
<p><strong>mothershead</strong>: But you saw them, sir. They couldn’t
hide their disgust. They don’t care anything for John, they’re just
trying to impress their friends.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Aren’t you being just a little harsh,
Mothershead? You yourself hardly treated John with much loving kindness
when he first arrived.</p>
<p><strong>mothershead</strong>: I bathed him, didn’t I? I fed him and
cleaned up after him! If loving kindness can be called care and
practical concern, then yes, I did treat him with loving kindness, and
I’m not ashamed to say it.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: You’re right, Mothershead, please forgive
me… Of course, I appreciate everything you’ve done for John, and I’m
glad that you are concerned about his welfare. But, I’m the physician in
charge and I must do what I think best. I’m also very late, so please
forgive me.</p>
<p><strong>mothershead</strong>: If you ask me, sir, he’s just being
stared at all over again.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: When will the stream be aweary of flowing
under my eye? When will the wind be aweary of blowing over the sky? When
will the clouds be aweary of fleeting? When will the heart be aweary of
beating, and nature die?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Never, oh! Never, nothing will die. the
stream flows the wind blows the heart beats Nothing will die.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Mr. Treves, there is something I’ve been
meaning to ask you for some time…</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Yes, John?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: …Can you cure me?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: No John, I can’t. I can care for you, but I
can’t cure you.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: I thought as much.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: John…?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Are you looking for me, Sister?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: No sir, Mr. Merrick. I have something for
you.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I thought these things would be helpful with
your cathedral.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: The cathedral is coming along nicely.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Yes, soon I will start the main spire, but
I must finish these columns first, How kind of her!</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: How blind of me. Is there anything else,
John, anything at all that I could get for you?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Oh no! There is nothing! I have everything,
you have given me everything I could possibly want. I am happy every
hour of the day. I only wish there was something I could give to
you.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Please John, it would give me so much
pleasure to give you something. Something just for yourself. Isn’t there
something you would like to have?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: You want a dressing bag, John?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: You don’t think it’s too gaudy, do you?</p>
<p><strong>mothershead</strong>: Mr. Treves, some more books arrived for
Mr. Merrick.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter put
them in my office.</p>
<p><strong>mothershead</strong>: Yes sir. What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: A dressing bag.</p>
<p><strong>mothershead</strong>: Very smart indeed.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Yes. John wants it.</p>
<p><strong>mothershead</strong>: A dressing bag?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: You don’t think it’s too gaudy, do you.</p>
<p><strong>mothershead</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: John thinks it’s very dashing. Something no
gentleman should be without. I’m inclined to agree.</p>
<p><strong>mothershead</strong>: A dressing bag?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Night!</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: You stay with me.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Dinner will be served, shortly, dear.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: More romances for John?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Hmmm?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: …Freddie! What’s the matter? You’ve been like
this all evening.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Oh… I’ve just been thinking about something
that man Bytes said.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Oh, Freddie. What could that wretched vampire
say to upset you?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: That I am very little different from
him.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Oh that’s absurd, Frederick. No, no Frederick,
that’s all wrong! John is happier and more fulfilled now than he has
ever been in his entire life. And, that is completely due to you.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: But why did I do it? What was this all for?
So John Merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort? Or so
I could become famous?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Frederick, just what is it that you are
saying?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: …Am I a good man or am I a bad man?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Oh Frederick.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: You’re a good man. A very good man.</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: Ahh! Broadneck! You’ll no doubt be pleased to
know that we’ve received a smashing response to my letter. It’s all very
heartwarming, though several letters do mention how beastly it would be
to part the poor fellow from Mr. Treves and the staff, but since the
committee insists…</p>
<p><strong>broadneck</strong>: Good day, Carr Gomm.</p>
<p><strong>mothershead</strong>: Is this all there is for John?</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: I’m afraid so, Mrs. Mothershead. Perhaps
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>mothershead</strong>: What is it? What is it?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Don’t you think this is a bit premature? We
don’t have the backing yet to…</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: Steady on, Treves. Have a seat.</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: Gentlemen, I know we begin every meeting by
reading the minutes, but in the interest of speed I think we should
conclude a matter discussed previously, to wit, that of Mr. John
Merrick, the Elephant Man…</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: Mr. Broadneck?</p>
<p><strong>broadneck</strong>: Mr. Chairman! I was under the distinct
impression that we had concluded discussion of this disagreeable matter.
Had we not ascertained that an Elephant Man is not acceptable as a
patient? Have we not, very generously, allowed the creature to use two
of our rooms until such time as he could be properly disposed of? Have
we not…</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: I must be more careful!</p>
<p><strong>broadneck</strong>: Which brings to mind my next point. The
rules, gentlemen, the rules. In a society such as ours, it is of
paramount importance that we not stray from the established order. Has
that order not already been fearfully strained by allowing this… this…
sideshow exhibit to take up residence, however temporary, in two very
useful rooms, the purpose of which would be far better served in
accommodating treatable patients, patients to whom this hospital was
originally dedicated? I believe we have a duty…</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: …Ladybug, ladybug, fly away home… it’s
cloudy out, I know, but remember; behind the clouds there is always the
sun.</p>
<p><strong>broadneck</strong>: …In light of these facts, our course is
clear. The question is not whether to accept this creature as a patient,
the question is when will those rooms be vacated for use by better
qualified, more deserving cases? I move that this Elephant Man be
removed from the premises immediately. We have a sacred duty to cure the
sick, not care for circus animals. That is my last word on the subject.
Mr. Chairman, shall we vote?</p>
<p><strong>carr gomm</strong>: I take it, Mr. Broadneck, that your mind
is fixed on this matter?</p>
<p><strong>broadneck</strong>: Mr. Chairman! Don’t you have ears? I am
unalterably opposed to any…</p>
<p><strong>broadneck</strong>: …No, my mind is made up on this, and I am
resolved to stand firm. You shall not sway me. May we now vote,
Mr. Chairman, at long last?</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: Yes, I believe that time has come.</p>
<p><strong>1st footman</strong>: Gentlemen, Her Royal Highness
Alexandra, Princess of Wales.</p>
<p><strong>alix</strong>: Good morning, gentlemen. I hope I am not
interrupting?</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: Indeed not, your Highness. Your presence is
always greatly appreciated. We were just about to put the matter of
Mr. Merrick to a vote. The Princess is very interested in Mr. Merrick’s
fate.</p>
<p><strong>alix</strong>: Indeed I am sir, as is the Queen. I have a
brief communication from her Highness which she has requested I read to
you: To the Governing Committee, London Hospital. I would very much like
to commend you for the charitable face you have shown Mr. John Merrick,
the Elephant Man. It is laudable that you have provided one of England’s
most unfortunate sons with a safe and tranquil harbour, a home. For this
immeasurable kindness, as well as the many other acts of mercy on behalf
of the poor, of which Mr. Carr Gomm has kept me informed, I gratefully
thank you. Signed Victoria, Empress of India, Queen of the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. I am sure you gentlemen may be
counted on to do the Christian thing.</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: Thank you very much, your Highness, you may be
sure we shall.</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: Well then, I move that Mr. John Merrick be
admitted to the London Hospital on a permanent basis, on condition that
the Hospital shall receive a yearly payment equal to the cost of
occupying one bed, and that the funds for his care shall be clearly
separate from hospital funds. All those in favor.</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: The motion is carried.</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: Well, now we may go about our normal
business.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Please, come in.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Good afternoon, John, Mr. Carr Gomm has
something he would like to say to you.</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: Mr. Merrick, it is my great pleasure to
welcome you, officially to The London Hospital. The Governing Committee
this morning voted unanimously to provide you these rooms on a permanent
basis. This is your home now. I’m so very, very pleased for you.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: So you see, John, there’s no need for a
lighthouse. All your friends are here.</p>
<p><strong>mothershead</strong>: Welcome home, John.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: …my… home?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Yes, John.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: You did this for me?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Please… please thank the governing
committee for me. I will do my utmost to merit their kindness.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: My home.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: There is one more thing, John. Here.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Is it the one you wanted?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Oh, Mr. Treves. Mr. Treves.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Are you sure? Because I can take it
back.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Mr. Treves. Thank you my… friends.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Here now, these lovely ladies ain’t never seen

scare him.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Hello, my name is John Merrick. I am very,
VERY pleased to meet you!</p>
<p><strong>night porter</strong>: Curtain time!!!</p>
<p><strong>night porter</strong>: No, no! You look lovely. Don’t change
a thing, darling. You look like the bleedin’ Prince of Wales.</p>
<p><strong>night porter</strong>: My friends… The Elephant Man!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Horrible… I told you it was horrible… just
horrible.</p>
<p><strong>bytes</strong>: Perhaps the ladies would like a closer
look?</p>
<p><strong>whores</strong>: Come on Jack… No… No, don’t. Etc.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: ‘Cor, he’s a real ladies’ man, come on… give
the ladies’ man a kiss.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Come on, you’ll give him a kiss.</p>
<p><strong>whore</strong>: Come on, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Here that’s enough romance. Now into bed.</p>
<p><strong>night porter</strong>: A prince needs a harem!</p>
<p><strong>night porter</strong>: Mind his head… You’ll kill him.</p>
<p><strong>night porter</strong>: Quiet down. Quiet down. You’ll have
the whole place down on us.</p>
<p><strong>bytes</strong>: Bring him out then, so’s we all can see

<p><strong>night porter</strong>: Everyone outside!!!</p>
<p><strong>one man</strong>: Give ’im a drink.</p>
<p><strong>night porter</strong>: Here now… Here now… He’s had enough…

<p><strong>night porter</strong>: Meet you at the Peacock.</p>
<p><strong>one of the crowd</strong>: Bring your friend.</p>
<p><strong>night porter</strong>: He’s had ’is fill for one night.</p>
<p><strong>night porter</strong>: I did real well tonight.</p>
<p><strong>night porter</strong>: Here… buy yourself a sweet.</p>
<p><strong>bytes</strong>: My treasure…</p>
<p><strong>bytes</strong>: Aren’t you glad to see me?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Bytes!</p>
<p><strong>bytes</strong>: Get into your cloak… …now, your hood… do
it!</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: …Alright.</p>
<p><strong>bytes</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: John?</p>
<p><strong>young porter</strong>: Mr. Treves?</p>
<p><strong>mothershead</strong>: Good God… John?</p>
<p><strong>night porter</strong>: I… I don’t know what you mean,
Sir.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Don’t lie to me. I know all about it. You
were SEEN. Where did you take him?</p>
<p><strong>night porter</strong>: Take him? Now wait… I didn’t take him
anywhere. We were just having some fun. We didn’t hurt him… just having
a laugh, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>night porter</strong>: When I left him, he was in his bed,
safe and sound.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: YOU BASTARD! You tortured him. YOU TORTURED
HIM, you bastard. WHERE is</p>
<p><strong>night porter</strong>: YOU’RE NOT LISTENING TO ME! I ain’t
done nothing wrong. People pay to see your monster, Mr. Treves. I just
take the money.</p>
<p><strong>night porter</strong>: Have a care, Mr. Treves. I ain’t
afraid of you! You and your bleedin’ Elephant Man! I’m glad what I did!
And you can’t do nothing! Only Mothershead can sack me.</p>
<p><strong>mothershead</strong>: Done.</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: I’d like to think I felt no less for John than
you, Treves, but face the facts, the man has disappeared, very likely to
the continent. There’s no question of your going after him, you’re
desperately needed here by your patients. Remember Treves, you did
everything in your power… everything in your power.</p>
<p><strong>bytes</strong>: Still haven’t eaten, eh?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Bytes… please!</p>
<p><strong>bytes</strong>: Eat, my treasure, I want you healthy.</p>
<p><strong>bytes</strong>: I’m beginning to feel your weight.</p>
<p><strong>bytes</strong>: …The result is plain to see. Ladies and
Gentlemen… THE TERRIBLE ELEPHANT</p>
<p><strong>bytes</strong>: Turn around!</p>
<p><strong>bytes</strong>: Dance!</p>
<p><strong>bytes</strong>: Dance!</p>
<p><strong>bytes</strong>: Eat, my treasure.</p>
<p><strong>bytes</strong>: Eat. I said eat!</p>
<p><strong>bytes</strong>: Eat, damn you. EAT! EAT!</p>
<p><strong>bytes</strong>: I said EAT!!</p>
<p><strong>bytes</strong>: The result is plain to see. Ladies and
gentlemen… THE TERRIBLE ELEPHANT</p>
<p><strong>bytes</strong>: Turn around!</p>
<p><strong>bytes</strong>: Dance!</p>
<p><strong>bytes</strong>: Up! Up!</p>
<p><strong>bytes</strong>: Give the call of the elephant!</p>
<p><strong>bytes</strong>: Louder!</p>
<p><strong>bytes</strong>: Get up you miserable bastard!</p>
<p><strong>bytes</strong>: I’m beatin’ a dead horse.</p>
<p><strong>bytes</strong>: Another bleedin’ heart!</p>
<p><strong>bytes</strong>: You sly bastard. You’re doing this to spite
me, aren’t you!</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Aw, Bytes, he’s sick.</p>
<p><strong>bytes</strong>: He’s doing it to spite me, I tell you, and
it’s got to stop!</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: He’s sick, Bytes. He’s going to die.</p>
<p><strong>bytes</strong>: If he does it’s his own fault! But I’m not
burying that swollen bag of flesh.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>bytes</strong>: I’ll show you! I’ll show you!</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Don’t!</p>
<p><strong>bytes</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Bytes, please…</p>
<p><strong>bytes</strong>: Out!</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Bytes! Bytes, please!!</p>
<p><strong>plumed dwarf</strong>: You alright?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: y-y-yes–</p>
<p><strong>plumed dwarf</strong>: Want to come out?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: You’re English.</p>
<p><strong>plumed dwarf</strong>: Of course! You want out?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>plumed dwarf</strong>: Won’t be a moment.</p>
<p><strong>plumed dwarf</strong>: We’ve decided… You’ve got to get away
from here…</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Here… you’ll need these.</p>
<p><strong>plumed dwarf</strong>: Good of you, mate.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: But… but…</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: I’ll be alright.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Thank you, my friends.</p>
<p><strong>plumed dwarf</strong>: I’ll go in with you, you’ll need a
ticket.</p>
<p><strong>plumed dwarf</strong>: I’m just going to help my friend on
board.</p>
<p><strong>plumed dwarf</strong>: This’ll do.</p>
<p><strong>plumed dwarf</strong>: I’m sorry I could only get you a third
class ticket, but it’s all we had.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Oh no, my friend…</p>
<p><strong>plumed dwarf</strong>: Say hello to London for me. I miss
her.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Oh, yes.</p>
<p><strong>plumed dwarf</strong>: You know, I saw you once there, in
London. You’re a great attraction.</p>
<p><strong>plumed dwarf</strong>: Luck, my friend, luck. Who needs it
more than we?</p>
<p><strong>conductor</strong>: I’m sorry, you’ll have to leave now.</p>
<p><strong>conductor</strong>: This is the end of the line, you’ll have
to leave now.</p>
<p><strong>first-mate</strong>: May I see your ticket?</p>
<p><strong>first-mate</strong>: I’m sorry, there’s no room for you on
this ship, you’ll have to wait for the next one, in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>first-mate</strong>: You heard me. There’s no room. Now be
off with you.</p>
<p><strong>ticket taker</strong>: Wait! One more!</p>
<p><strong>ticket taker</strong>: You’ll have to hurr…</p>
<p><strong>young woman</strong>: Look! It’s Dover!</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Finally! Dover!</p>
<p><strong>mother’s voice</strong>: Little beast! I thought mummy told
you not to bring that horrid thing. Can’t you behave?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Mummy! Mummy! Look at that man! His head, it’s
huge! Mummy, why is his head so big? Mummy? Mummy?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Do be quiet Little Jim. Can’t you see Mummy
is speaking?</p>
<p><strong>little jim</strong>: Hey Mister, why is your head so big?</p>
<p><strong>little jim</strong>: Mister!</p>
<p><strong>boys</strong>: Mister! Mister!</p>
<p><strong>little jim</strong>: Why don’t you answer me?</p>
<p><strong>little jim</strong>: Now I’ll see you…</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: My son! My son! Help!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Stop that man! Stop that man!</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: I am not an animal… I’m not… I’m not… I am
a man.</p>
<p><strong>mothershead</strong>: There’s a policeman to see you,
Sir.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Are you Frederick Treves, sir?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: You know this man, sir?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Yes, he’s… my friend.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Mr. Treves! Treves.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: John…. how can you ever forgive me?</p>
<p><strong>kendal</strong>: It’s all arranged. I’ll send over some
evening gowns for the sisters that you select to accompany Mr. Merrick.
You’ll be using the Royal entrance and Princess Alexandra herself will
be there to welcome him to her private box.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: I’m very grateful to you, Mrs. Kendal. This
is just the thing to help him forget his ordeal. John will be very
excited.</p>
<p><strong>kendal</strong>: Well it is a miracle he ever got back. And,
I’m sure, Mr. Treves, under your expert care, he’ll have many happy
years ahead.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: I fear not, Mrs. Kendal. Even in the short
time he was gone the size of his head has increased rapidly… as is his
pain.</p>
<p><strong>kendal</strong>: How awful for John.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: And yet, not once have any of us heard him
complain.</p>
<p><strong>kendal</strong>: Is he… dying then?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Yes. There is nothing more frustrating,
nothing that makes a physician feel more useless, than standing by
watching his patient deteriorate. And when that patient is a friend, no…
no, there’s absolutely nothing I can do.</p>
<p><strong>kendal</strong>: Well, it’s all quite… I’ve never heard… It’s
quite…</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: You women are such strange and wonderful
creatures… Alas, it seems to be my fate to fall in love with each and
everyone of you. I especially wish you could all be with me tonight… I’m
finally going to the theatre.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: …The theatre…</p>
<p><strong>chorus</strong>: O for a Muse of fire, that would ascend The
brightest heaven of invention, A kingdom for a stage, princes to act And
monarchs to behold the swelling scene! Then should the warlike Harry,
like himself, Assume the port of Mars; and at his heels, Leash’d in like
hounds, should famine, sword and fire Crouch for employment. But pardon,
gentles all, The flat unraised spirits that have dar’d On this unworthy
scaffold to bring forth So great an object: can this cockpit hold The
vasty fields of Rance? Or may we cram Within this wooden O the very
casques That did affright the air at Agincourt? O, pardon! since a
crooked figure may Attest in little place a million; And let us, ciphers
to this great account, On your imaginary forces work.</p>
<p><strong>k. hen</strong>: Fair Katharine, and most fair, will you
vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms Such as will enter at a lady’s ear
And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?</p>
<p><strong>kath</strong>: Your majesty shall mock at me; I cannot speak
your England.</p>
<p><strong>k. hen</strong>: O fair Katharine, if you will love me
soundly with your French heart, I will be glad to hear you confess it
brokenly with your English tongue. Do you like me, Kate?</p>
<p><strong>kath</strong>: Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is “like
me”.</p>
<p><strong>k. hen</strong>: An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like
an angel.</p>
<p><strong>kath</strong>: O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont
pleines de tramperies.</p>
<p><strong>k. hen</strong>: What say you, fair one? That the tongues of
men are full of deceits?</p>
<p><strong>kath</strong>: Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of
deceits.</p>
<p><strong>k. hen</strong>: I know no way to mince it in love, but
directly to say “I love you”. What! A speaker is but a prater; a rhyme
is but a ballad. A good leg will fall; a straight back will stoop; a
black beard will turn white; a curl’d pate will grow bald; a fair face
will wither; a full eye will wax hollow; but a good heart, Kate, is the
sun and the moon, or rather the sun and not the moon; for it shines
bright and never changes, but keeps his course truly.</p>
<p><strong>chorus</strong>: Thus far, with rough and allunable pen, Our
bending author hath pursued the story, In little room confining mighty
men, Mangling by starts the full course of their glory. Small time, but
in that small most greatly liv’d This star of England: Fortune made his
sword; By which the world’s best garden he achiev’d.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. kendal</strong>: Thank you for your warm greeting.
Ladies and gentlemen, tonight’s performance was very special to me,
because it was very special to someone else, a man who knows the theatre
and loves the theatre, and yet tonight is the first time he’s ever
actually been here. I would like to dedicate… the whole company wishes
to dedicate, from their hearts, tonight’s performance to Mr. John
Merrick, my dear friend.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Stand up, John. Let them see you.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Oh no, I couldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: It’s for you, John. It’s all for you. Go
ahead, let them see you.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: I feel as if I’ve traveled my whole life
just to stand here.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Wasn’t Mrs. Kendal wonderful? I can’t blame
the King for wanting to marry her.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Will the cathedral be finished soon,
John?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Yes, very soon.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Splendid. it’s truly a masterpiece. Well, I
suppose I’ll be on my way now. I hoped your enjoyed yourself this
evening.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Oh yes! It was wonderful!</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: I’m glad, John. Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Mr. Treves?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Yes John?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Mr. Treves, tell me… tell me truly. Is it
alright, did I make any mistakes that you can see?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: No, John, not one that I can see.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Then I shouldn’t change anything?</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: No, no, I wouldn’t change a thing.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: …I’ll walk you to the door.</p>
<p><strong>treves</strong>: Goodnight John. Sleep well.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: You too, my friend. Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: It is finished.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: John… Merrick!</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: When will the stream be aweary of flowing
under my eye?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: When will the wind be aweary of blowing
over the sky?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: When will the clouds be aweary of
fleeting?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: When will the heart be aweary of
beating….</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: …and nature die?</p>
<p><strong>john’s mum</strong>: Never, oh! Never, nothing will die; the
stream flows, the wind blows, the cloud fleets, the heart beats…</p>
<p><strong>john’s mum</strong>: Nothing will die.</p>
