<p><strong>narrator</strong>: No one would have believed in the early
years of the21st century, that our world was being watched by
intelligences greater than our own. That as men busied themselves about
their various concerns, they observed and studied. Like the way a man
with a microscope might scrutinize the creatures that swarm and multiply
in a drop of water. With infinite complacency men went to and fro about
the globe, confident of our empire over this world. Yet, across the gulf
of space, intellects, vast and cool and unsympathetic regarded our plant
with envious eyes. And slowly and surely, drew their plans against
us.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Ray!! Ferrier! Whoa!</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: I need you back at 4:00 instead of 12:00 I got
half of Korea coming in.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: No, no, no I can’t. I’m on a 12 hour blow! Call
Tadesko.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Tadesko can’t move 40 containers in an hour. I
need somebody who can do double picks.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I wish I could help you Sal. God damn union
regulations.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Come on, I’m in a position here!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Come on, you remember the union regulations,
Sal.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: You know what your problem is?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I can think of a couple of women who’d be happy
to tell you.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Is it 8:30? We say that?</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: We said 8:00.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Hey, this is one safe looking vehicle you got
yourself here Tim. Congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Thank You.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: 8 o’clock huh?</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: Um-Huh. We’ll be back by 9:30 on Sunday,
depending on the traffic.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: There he is! You got a hug?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Confusing handshake? Kick in the teeth? The
door’s locked. : Still working on those manners?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Hello dad.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Hello, Rachel!</p>
<p><strong>robbie</strong>: The door’s locked.</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: I’ll just get it in the door.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: It’s got rollers, just roll it.</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: Well we can’t roll it up the stairs now
can we?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Really, I got it from here, okay?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: It’s a 302 V8. It’s gonna be out of here next
week.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You better get going if you want to beat the
traffic, don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: You’re out of milk. And everything
else.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Would you close the door please? Now that
that’s my refrigerator.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: I’m gonna go wait outside. I love you
sweetheart see you in a few days.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Bye Tim.</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: I’d better get this upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Mom, Mom!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Mary Ann, let me get this.</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: I can get it.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: A little old to still be sharing aren’t
they?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I don’t hear any complaints.</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: No, I do.</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: Robbie’s got a paper… …on the French
occupation of Algeria due Monday which he’s yet to begin. It would be
nice if he were done by the time we got back so we don’t have to keep
him up all night on Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>robbie</strong>: I just got to type it up.</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: No, you just got to start writing it
first.</p>
<p><strong>robbie</strong>: I love you mom!</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: I love you. Listen to your father.</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: Oh, no shoes on the bed.</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: We’ll be at my parent’s house in Boston
but don’t call the house line, because you know. Well the point is I’ve
got my cell phone. So if anything comes up, or if you have any questions
just call.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Believe it or not, I can handle it.</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: I’ll leave the phone on.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Mary Ann? It’s a good look for you.</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: You think?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: Take care of our kids.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Mary Ann, you got nothing to worry about.
Listen, you tell your mother that Ray sends his love and kisses.</p>
<p><strong>mary ann</strong>: She’ll love that.</p>
<p><strong>robbie</strong>: Baseball season’s over.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Five minutes. It’s not going to kill you.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: There he is. Boston? That’s how it is? That’s
how it’s gonna be?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Careful with that throw.</p>
<p><strong>robbie</strong>: Whatever Ray!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Your mom says you’ve got a report due on
Monday, so you are going to work on that when you’re done here.</p>
<p><strong>robbie</strong>: Yeah, I’m almost finished, I just got to
type it up.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Yeah, bullshit!</p>
<p><strong>robbie</strong>: Yeah, and what do you know Ray?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Everything. Haven’t you heard? Between me and
my brother, we know everything.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: What’s the capital of Australia?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: That’s one my brother knows.</p>
<p><strong>robbie</strong>: Is it okay with you if I just laugh the
first 500 times you tell that one.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Just do your report. We don’t send you to
school so you can flunk out.</p>
<p><strong>robbie</strong>: You don’t pay for it, Tim does.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: That’s half of what I’ve got.</p>
<p><strong>robbie</strong>: You’re an asshole. I hate coming here.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: That why you act like such a dick?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: That’s not how you’re going to get through
to him. You want him to listen to you…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What are you? Your mother or mine?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: To sleep. I work for a living.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: What are we supposed to eat?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You know, order.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I got a splinter.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Where’d you get it. Come here.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: On your porch railing.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What, you want me to… You want me to take that
out for you?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Absolutely not!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Well, come here let me see it.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: It’s gonna get infected.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: No it wont.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Yes, it’s gonna get infected.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: No, it won’t. When it’s ready, my body will
just push it out.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Push it out?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I read that. You should get TiVo. Tim got it
for my room. It’s awesome. I can watch all my shows after homework.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Yeah, I’ll just put that on my platinum card.
Robbie? Robbie?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What is that?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Hummus.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Hummus?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: From the health food place. I kept one of
their menus last time we were here.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Uh, you said order!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I meant order food! Where is Robbie?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: He went out.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Out where?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I don’t know. He just took your car and
left.</p>
<p><strong>friend 1</strong>: You ever see something like that?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: In the springtime maybe. Not this time of year.
Come on, we can see better from the back yard.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: That is so weird.</p>
<p><strong>friend 2</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: The wind is blowing toward the storm.</p>
<p><strong>friend 2</strong>: That is weird.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Rachel, wanna see something cool?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I want to go inside.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I want to go inside.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Okay, you go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>friend 2</strong>: That’s enough weather for me.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I don’t want to go by myself.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Kind of fun, ain’t it?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Oh, Come on. It’s like the fourth of July.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: No it’s not.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: It’s okay. You’re fine.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: It hit right behind our house.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Yeah, well it’s not gonna hit there again
because lighting doesn’t strike twice in the same place.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Oh, SHIT!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Where’s Robbie?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Is Robbie okay? Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Where’s the thunder?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Why won’t it stop?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Is it over?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Just checking things out. Just wait, wait
there.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Are we going to be okay?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: No. I meant… Rachel, please, just stop asking
so many questions. Just wait here.</p>
<p><strong>friend 2</strong>: You believe this Ray? Every single
car.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>robbie</strong>: The car just stopped and…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You’re okay? Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>robbie</strong>: … and the lighting started hitting about a
block away over and over again. And me and this other guy we…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Where the hell’d you go?</p>
<p><strong>robbie</strong>: Over on Lincoln Avenue. … by the church.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Did you see it? Did you… Were you near it?</p>
<p><strong>robbie</strong>: Yeah. 26 times we counted! Over and over the
lighting started hitting. It opened up this hole or something…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: 26 times?</p>
<p><strong>robbie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Okay, well, you’re okay?</p>
<p><strong>robbie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Good, because your sister is in the house, I
want you to go in that house and I want you to stay with her. Okay? And
the next time you take my car with no driver’s license and no
permission, I call the cops. You better be there when I get back.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Robbie.</p>

you got any idea what’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I’m on my way to find out. Try umm… try
changing the solenoids.</p>
<p><strong>manny</strong>: Right, Right see, I told you that, the
solenoids.</p>
<p><strong>cop 1</strong>: Let us through. Let us through here.</p>
<p><strong>friend 3</strong>: Hey, what up, Ray?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I should of known you two were behind this.</p>
<p><strong>friend 3</strong>: Hey, god’s pissed off at the Neibor
hood</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Can you blame him?</p>
<p><strong>friend 4</strong>: You see it?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Yep, you got power where you are?</p>
<p><strong>friend 3</strong>: Nope, nothing.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: It’s the cars though. That’s the thing.</p>
<p><strong>friend 4</strong>: Solar Flare, that’s what this guy told
me.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: A solar flare?</p>
<p><strong>friend 4</strong>: Yeah, the sun shoots off blobs of plasma,
they turn into solar flare flashes. It’s the only thing that can kill
all of the electronic stuff.</p>
<p><strong>friend 3</strong>: Can I say something?</p>
<p><strong>friend 4</strong>: What bro?</p>
<p><strong>friend 3</strong>: The sun does not cause lightning,
okay?</p>
<p><strong>friend 4</strong>: Bro, I’m just telling you what that guy
said he heard.</p>
<p><strong>friend 3</strong>: I know but it just sounds dumb saying
that…</p>
<p><strong>cop 1</strong>: I never seen anything like this before. That
many strikes of lighting in one spot.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Is this the only place?</p>
<p><strong>friend 4</strong>: Is it hot?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: No. It’s freezing.</p>
<p><strong>cop 2</strong>: What is that?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You feel that?</p>
<p><strong>friend 3</strong>: Yeah, I feel that.</p>
<p><strong>friend 4</strong>: What is it the subway?</p>
<p><strong>cop 1</strong>: There’s no subway here.</p>
<p><strong>friend 4</strong>: PATH Train maybe?</p>
<p><strong>cop 1</strong>: That can’t be the water main.</p>
<p><strong>cop 2</strong>: There’s nothing else down there.</p>
<p><strong>cop 1</strong>: The water main doesn’t run through here.</p>
<p><strong>cop 2</strong>: Well, there’s something down there and it’s
moving.</p>
<p><strong>friend 4</strong>: Oh my god.</p>
<p><strong>friend 4</strong>: Ray, no, stay man.</p>

<p><strong>robbie</strong>: Wait a minute… you just said it was
buried.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: No, the machine I’m talking about was buried.
But, what came down in the lighting storm, what operates it. That’s the…

<p><strong>rachel</strong>: The what?</p>

<p><strong>ray</strong>: Because they are on their way to Boston….</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: … and so they just kept on going, they’re
probably up to your grandma’s house by now.</p>
<p><strong>robbie</strong>: I’m gonna call her.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: How come the lights are on here and not at
your place?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Umm…. Because nothing bad happened here.

<p><strong>ray</strong>: Okay, Rachel? This is your area. Okay, you are

<p><strong>ray</strong>: Everybody just relax, okay? Because we are here
now and we’re safe, and we’re gonna stay. And in the morning your mom
and Tim are going to be here and everything’s gonna be fine. Okay?
Okay.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: If everything’s fine, why do we have to
sleep in the basement. We’ve got perfectly good beds.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: It’s like a slumber party.</p>
<p><strong>robbie</strong>: What are you afraid is gonna happen to
us?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Nice basement.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I want to sleep in my bed. I’ve got back
problems.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Okay. You know on the Weather Channel when
there’s a tornado, and they tell you to go to the basement for safety?
It’s like that.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: There’s gonna be tornadoes?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Rachel, no more talking.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Could you be a little nicer to me. God!</p>
<p><strong>robbie</strong>: Wanna stay here?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Yeah. Good night, love you.</p>
<p><strong>robbie</strong>: Love you, Rache.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Is the lighting back?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: No, this is something else…</p>
<p><strong>robbie</strong>: AHHHH… WHAT’S THAT SOUND?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Are we still alive?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Down here!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Were you on this plane? Are you a
passenger?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Hey, how you doing? Wanna help me open
this?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Are you a passenger?</p>
<p><strong>news reporter</strong>: He’s deaf. The shell went off right
beside him. The camera on his shoulder saved his life. You hear that
Max? Your stupid camera saved your stupid life.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Where were you?</p>
<p><strong>news reporter</strong>: Out there in the pine barrens. We
were attached to a National Guard unit, the 83rd Mechanized. They moved
to one of those things around midnight. They’ve got some kind of shield
around them. We can’t see it, but everything we fire at them detonates
too early before we can get close enough to cause any damage. When they
flash that thing, everything lights up like Hiroshima.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: There’s more than one?</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: You gotta be kidding me right?</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: We were feeding New York but New York went
dark. So we patched over to D.C., they went down, L.A., Chicago, uplink
to London. Even called the affiliates to try and get them to catch the
feed, but nobody answered.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: It’s the same everywhere. Once the tripods
start to move, no more news comes out of that area.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Oh, my god!</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: You ain’t seen nothing yet.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I saw that storm. I was right in the middle of
one of those.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: No, you didn’t see it like this. Those
machines come up from under the ground, right? That means they must have
been buried there a long time ago. So who’s driving the god damn things?
Watch the lightning. Watch it….. Watch the lighting…..</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What is that?</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: That is them. They come down in capsules,
riding the lighting into the ground into the machines right?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: You hear that? We’re getting the hell out of
here.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Come on! Get in! Get in! Get in!</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Hey. Were you on that plane?</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Oh, that’s too bad, it would have been a
really great story.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Look at me. Look at me.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You keep your eyes only on me, you
understand?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Don’t look down, don’t look around me. I’m
taking you to the car and you’re gonna want to look around. But you are
not going to, are you?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You’re doing good. You’re doing good. Keep your
eyes on me. We’ll go right to Boston, and we’re gonna see your mom.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I’m not gonna look, dad.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: That’s a girl. That’s my girl. Okay, listen, I
want you to close your eyes. Got them closed?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Um-Huh.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: There you go. Keep em’ closed for me.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Robbie, get in.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Why are you yelling?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: It’s okay. Get in!</p>
<p><strong>robbie</strong>: Why the hell aren’t we on the turnpike?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Because I don’t want everybody to see we’ve got
a working car. We’ll stay along the Hudson until we find an open bridge
or ferry, then we’re gonna cross the Hudson. Then take the back roads
across Connecticut all the way to Boston.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Where is everybody?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I don’t know. Running, hiding, hiding in their
basements.</p>
<p><strong>robbie</strong>: If we had any balls, we’d go back there and
find one of those things and kill it.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Yeah, well, why don’t you just let me make the
big decisions, okay?</p>
<p><strong>robbie</strong>: Which would be when? Never Ray? Never’s
about your speed.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Okay, enough Robbie!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Okay! Enough with the Ray shit!! It’s dad, sir,
or if you want Mr. Ferrier. That sounds a little weird to me but you
decide.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Dad?!?!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Yes, Rachel.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I have to go to the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>robbie</strong>: Come on. I gotta go!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Not so fast, not so fast, all right? Now, there
are two things we have to watch out for, and the second is people who
might want our car.</p>
<p><strong>robbie</strong>: There’s nobody around!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Rachel! Rachel, that’s good right there.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: All right, then just go where I can see
you!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I’m not gonna look! JUST STAY IN SIGHT!!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Listen. Every time you don’t listen to me, I’m
telling your mother, okay? I’m making a list. I’m making a list!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I told you to stay where I could see you!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I’m sorry!</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Watch it, kid! YOU’RE GONNA GET
YOURSLELF</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: If I close my eyes, why don’t you drive for a
bit.</p>
<p><strong>robbie</strong>: I don’t have a license.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Since when has that stopped you?</p>
<p><strong>robbie</strong>: Ray. Ray. Dad!</p>
<p><strong>robbie</strong>: You think you could…. You think you

<p><strong>rachel</strong>: But we do right?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Yeah, we do.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Why’d he do that?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Why is he doing that?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: He wants a ride. Everybody just wants a
ride.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Can we give him one?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Just sit back and put on your seatbelt. Robbie,
put on your seatbelt.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Put on your seatbelt Rachel.</p>
<p><strong>robbie</strong>: Be careful.</p>

<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Dad?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: He’s gonna meet us. Hey, Robbie’s gonna meet
us, Rach, In Boston, at your grandma’s.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: What do you think mom’s doing right this
minute?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Mom? She’s in Boston. Waiting. And I know she’s
not sleeping ’cause she is so worried about you. … And she’s in
grandma’s kitchen, and she’s making that awful tea that she makes. And
they’re all just… … …there all just counting the minutes until they see
you again.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What is this? What… What is this?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I won.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You won?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: The walk, trot, and canter. Third place.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Sing me “Lullaby and Goodnight”?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I don’t remember that one.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Sing me “Hushabye Mountain”?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I’m sorry Rach, I don’t know that one
either.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I’m not bragging, baby. So don’t put me down.
Because I’ve got the fastest set of wheels in the town. Something comes
up to me that don’t even try….</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: … If I had a set of wings, man, I know she
could fly. She’s my little deuce coupe. You don’t know what I’ve got…
just my little deuce coupe. You don’t know what I’ve got….</p>
<p><strong>harland</strong>: Peach schnapps.</p>
<p><strong>harland</strong>: Disgusting, I know it. I found a whole case
of this shit.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>harland</strong>: I’m sorry about your son.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: We got separated… he’s gonna meet us in umm… in
Boston.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Did you… … Did you loose anybody?</p>
<p><strong>harland</strong>: All of them.</p>
<p><strong>harland</strong>: Harland Ogilvy.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Ray Ferrier.</p>
<p><strong>harland</strong>: I got water… Food…. Enough for weeks.
You’re welcome to stay, both of yous.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I’m sorry. I’m gonna get some sleep.</p>
<p><strong>harland</strong>: Those machines, those tripods they got…
They buried them… right under our feet. Since before there were even
people here. They’ve been planning this for a million years. We’re beat
to shit.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Please, my daughter.</p>
<p><strong>harland</strong>: Think about it. … They defeated the
greatest power in the world in a couple days. Walked right over us. ….
And these are only the first, they’ll keep coming. This is not a war any
more than there’s a war between men and maggots. This is an
extermination.</p>
<p><strong>harland</strong>: Are you afraid?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Of course I am.</p>
<p><strong>harland</strong>: I been around death plenty. Drive an
ambulance in the city. Well, drove and ambulance in the city. That’s all
over now, huh? …. You know the people who make it Ray? The ones that
don’t flatline before the hospital? It’s the ones who keep their eyes
open, keep looking at you, keep thinking. Ray. …. Running, that’s
what’ll kill you. …… I’m dead set on livin’.</p>
<p><strong>harland</strong>: Hah. Dead set on Living.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Thank you for taking us in.</p>
<p><strong>harland</strong>: We’re not going to be exterminated.</p>
<p><strong>harland</strong>: It’s okay! Come on, I wanna show you
something!</p>
<p><strong>harland</strong>: We’re gonna fight them Ray. They gotta have
a weakness. Come on, take a look.</p>
<p><strong>harland</strong>: Somehow they killed a few of these things
in Osaka. That’s what I heard. You telling me the Japanese can figure it
out but we can’t?</p>
<p><strong>harland</strong>: We can do it. We can get ’em. We can figure
it out.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Stay right there!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I have a daughter! Why did you bring us
here?</p>
<p><strong>harland</strong>: To fight ’em together, Ray. …. Now we’ll be
the ones coming up from underground. When the time is right, we’ll take
’em by supries, the way they took us. We’ll take ’em by surprise.</p>
<p><strong>harland</strong>: We’re right under their feet, Ray. Right
here, under their feet.</p>
<p><strong>harland</strong>: You miss your mommy? I had a little girl
nearly your age. You know, if anything happens to your daddy, I’ll take
care of you.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Rachel!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You don’t have anything to say to her, do you
understand? If you want to talk to somebody, or ask somebody a question,
you ask me!</p>
<p><strong>harland</strong>: What exactly is your plan, Ray? I know what
I’m gonna do. How about you? You gonna sit here, wait for them to come
get you? Is that your plan?</p>
<p><strong>harland</strong>: Maybe you want to get caught. Couple of
days hiding in a basement too much for you, I bet. You’ll probably turn
yourself right in!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Listen. It stopped.</p>
<p><strong>harland</strong>: Maybe you’ll be okay. Maybe you’ll get
lucky and they’ll train you as their pet. You know, train you, feed you,
teach you how to do tricks…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: WILL YOU SHUT UP AND LISTEN?!?!?!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Give me that!</p>
<p><strong>harland</strong>: You and I… I don’t think we are on the same
page.</p>
<p><strong>harland</strong>: Not My Blood!!!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Stop it! Stop it! You gotta stop it! You gotta
be quiet or they’ll hear you!</p>
<p><strong>harland</strong>: They drink us!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Please, they’ll hear you!</p>
<p><strong>harland</strong>: Then they spray us, like a fertilizer!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You gotta be quiet!</p>
<p><strong>harland</strong>: Drink US and….</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: They’re gonna come back down here!</p>
<p><strong>harland</strong>: Then they spit us out all over their
goddamn red weeds!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Do you understand what I’m gonna have to do? I
can’t let my daughter die because of you.</p>
<p><strong>harland</strong>: This tunnel will get us to the city. We’ll
have our own tunnels there. Ready Made! Subway, see what I’m saying!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Stop it!</p>
<p><strong>harland</strong>: You can hide a whole army down there!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Stop it!!</p>
<p><strong>harland</strong>: … We’ll go underground!</p>
<p><strong>harland</strong>: Sneak attacks at night!</p>
<p><strong>harland</strong>: We’re the resistance Ray! They can’t occupy
this country! Occupations always fail! History’s taught us that a
thousand times. This is our land.</p>
<p><strong>harland</strong>: … We eat it, we breathe it, only we can
live on it! They can’t survive here Ray. They weren’t built for it.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Whatever you hear… don’t take this off.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Dad??</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Rach?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Dad?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What was that song… that lullaby I didn’t
know?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Hushabye Mountains</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Yeah. Please, Rach, sing it.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: … A gentle breeze….</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Don’t stop.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: … On Hushabye Mountain…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: That’s my girl.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: … For far away my baby goes…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: … it fills the sails …</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: … of boats that are waiting …</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: … Waiting to sail your worries away …</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: … So close your eyes. You’re on Hushabye
Mountain …</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: … Wave goodbye to the cares of the day and
watch your boat, from Hushabye Mountain, sail far away from Lullaby
Bay.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: AHHHH!!!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Rachel???</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: RACHEL!!! Oh, my god, no!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Rachel? Rachel? Rachel??</p>

<p><strong>narrator</strong>: From the moment the invaders arrived,
breathed our air, ate and drank, they were doomed. They were undone,
destroyed, after all of man’s weapons and devices had failed, by the
tiniest creatures that God and his wisdom, put upon this earth. At the
toll of a billion deaths, man had earned his immunity, is right to
survive among this planet’s infinite organisms. And that right is ours
against all challenges, for men do not live nor die in vein.</p>
