<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Did Max mention anything about any jobs?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What about boxing?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: What about it?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What are you saying?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: You said if you didn’t have a winning record
after eleven fights, you’d talk to Max.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: So, it was a draw.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Yeah, I’m 5-5 and 1.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: So, it’s not a winning record.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: It’s not losing record.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: That’s not what you said. You said if you
didn’t have a winning record –</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Don’t be shitty.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: How am I being shitty?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Don’t be shitty.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: I wouldn’t keep bugging you, but you said he
said he would have a job for us.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I’m not gonna bring it up to him.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Of course I don’t want you to bring it up to
him… But if it comes up…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I’ll page you.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Yeah. Page me. You know the number?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Yeah. I know the number.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Cause if you don’t know the number, I can
page you with the number so you’ll have the number.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I know the number.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: I’ll page you with the number. I’ll see you
later. What time you done?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I got no idea.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Ask if he said anything to her.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I will.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: I’ll page you with the number.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Bye.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Honey?</p>
<p><strong>jess</strong>: Where were you?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: So, what kind of gig is this?</p>
<p><strong>jess</strong>: Easy night. Bachelor party. Can we give Wendy
a ride?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: No. What kind of bachelor party?</p>
<p><strong>jess</strong>: The easy kind. They’re young and rich and well
mannered.</p>
<p><strong>jess</strong>: Oh my god. What happened?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: A draw. What makes you think they’re well
mannered?</p>
<p><strong>jess</strong>: Bobby, this is a plumb gig. It’s a bunch of
young agents and it’s at a restaurant. It’s gonna be easy and we’ll make
a lot of money.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I don’t like you working with Wendy. Why are
you working with Wendy?</p>
<p><strong>jess</strong>: They requested her. It was her gig. Max put me
on as a favor.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Some favor. I hope they know you’re not like
Wendy.</p>
<p><strong>jess</strong>: Oh, please.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: If they asked for her, they’re probably
expecting blowjobs all around.</p>
<p><strong>jess</strong>: Will you cut it out! Get ready, we’re already
late.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Who’s watching the baby?</p>
<p><strong>jess</strong>: She’s downstairs with Ruth. Get ready.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I’m ready.</p>
<p><strong>jess</strong>: Bullshit. These are classy customers. You
can’t show up all fucked up with a Fila running suit on.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: They’re not too classy to have tits rubbed in
their face.</p>
<p><strong>jess</strong>: Stop. I love you.</p>
<p><strong>jess</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>hostess</strong>: May I help…?</p>
<p><strong>hostess</strong>: Oh, hi. They’ve been expecting you. Take
the elevator upstairs. You can change in the card room.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You talk to Max today?</p>
<p><strong>jess</strong>: I’m not gonna mention Ricky to him.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Don’t expect you to mention it to him. I’m
just saying, if –</p>
<p><strong>jess</strong>: The only way he’ll go with Ricky is if you’re
in too.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Well, that’s not gonna happen.</p>
<p><strong>jess</strong>: Fine. You want to help Ricky, talk to Maxie
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I feel weird asking him.</p>
<p><strong>jess</strong>: You shouldn’t. He likes you.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I just wish he never brought it up. Ricky
won’t shut up about it.</p>
<p><strong>jess</strong>: Forget Ricky. You should be glad Max got you
driving for me.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: No coke tonight. Right?</p>
<p><strong>jess</strong>: Leave me alone. I haven’t touched anything in
months.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Did you get the license plate of the
truck?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Johnny Red rocks.</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: Martel’s and coke. One ice cube. In a
snifter this time.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Snifter are for warm drinks –</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: Yeah, snifters are for cognac –</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: When served warm –</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: What’s the matter? You ain’t got no
snifters in this motherfucker?</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: We have snifters</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: Then put my Martel’s in a snifter.</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: Like I’m gonna break her goddamn
snifter.</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: It’s already been a hell of a night. Where
you been?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I had a fight up at Sportsman’s.</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: Well, you look it. You win?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Draw.</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: What’s your record at?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: 5-5-1.</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: Yeah, well you let me know when you wanna
start makin the real money.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Yeah, sure.</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: I’m serious. Humping sheetrock and driving
on weekends got to get to you after a while. Might be nice to buy your
lady something. All it takes is one fight.</p>
<p><strong>horny guy</strong>: Whu –</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: There’s no touching.</p>
<p><strong>horny guy</strong>: But what about them?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I don’t give a shit. I work for her. No
touching.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: That’s not allowed.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I said no touching.</p>
<p><strong>horny guy</strong>: Look, man, I’m the bachelor, alright? I
gave her a hundred bucks in tips alone –</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Get your hands off of her.</p>
<p><strong>horny guy</strong>: Dude, listen, man. I’m cool. How much for
the treatment?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Your dance is over.</p>
<p><strong>horny guy</strong>: Come on, dude. The other chick’s giving
my best man a blow job in the toilet. I know the drill, I’ll wear a
rubber –</p>
<p><strong>jess</strong>: God damn it…</p>
<p><strong>partier</strong>: Call the police.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: What the fuck was that about?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You wanna get us busted? If Max found out you
were turning tricks –</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: I got news for you, Bobby, he don’t give a
shit.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: You think he don’t know? I give him his cut
of seventeen hundred, I think he knows I can’t make that lap
dancing.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: No more.</p>
<p><strong>jess</strong>: Bobby…</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Fuck you! No more for you. You won’t be Jess’
driver for shit when Maxie hears this shit happened again.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Nobody’s fuckin talking to you.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: And how could you fucking leave Horrace
hanging?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I got news for you, Horrace got his ass out
of there before you did.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What? You don’t think Horrace would leave
your white ass in there to hang?</p>
<p><strong>jess</strong>: Alright. Enough already. Let’s get some food.
I better call Maxie and tell him what happened before he hears it on his
own.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: So I’m like, ‘Maybe I’m not on the list cause
I’m not a fuckin Persian.’</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I thought you hate that club.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: I do. It’s a fuckin Persian Palace.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Then why do you try to get in?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Fuck them.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Shhh…</p>
<p><strong>decorator</strong>: And as you can see, we’re a little behind
in here. We always knew the kitchen would be the trouble spot.</p>
<p><strong>husband</strong>: When will it be ready? Are we still
shooting for Christmas? I really want Christmas in the new house.</p>
<p><strong>decorator</strong>: We’re trying. Unfortunately the trades
are stacking a bit. But look at this Italian plaster job. The color
skim- coat will go on next.</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: It looks great.</p>
<p><strong>decorator</strong>: Did you see the stove yet?</p>
<p><strong>husband</strong>: The Viking was delivered?</p>
<p><strong>decorator</strong>: Yes, of course. It’s in the garage.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: You see that, bro? She wants to fuck me.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: You see that? My shit’s blowing up.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Come on, man. Not with the owners here.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Hey, baby… Nothing. What are you doing…?
Yeah, I’ll probably cut out early…</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Watch out, the fag’s here. Get off the
fucking phone. Then he wants to know why he’s still sweeping floors.
Bobby, you got a minute?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Look, Bobby, I don’t know what happened, and
I don’t want to know what happened, but something’s up.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Maxie wants me to replace you on the job
tomorrow. He wants you to come by the office today.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: They were grabbing her fucking ass –</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Hey. I don’t know, I don’t want to know. Far
as I’m concerned, you’re a good kid. I got news, though, without you
here I can’t keep on your friend. I got enough people pretending to
sweep.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Do me a favor, Arthur, keep him on til I see
what’s happening.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Hi, uh, excuse me. I’m here to see
Mr. Reuben.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: You’re Bobby, right?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Good afternoon, Bobby. I’ll let Max know
you’re here.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: He’ll be a minute, hon. You want some
coffee?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: No thank you.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: You sure? I just made it.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: No, thank you. I’m good. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Will ya calm down. Just calm down for a minute,
Nadeleh. The money will be there. How do I know? I just know… Yes. Yes,
that’s exactly what I’m saying… You got my word.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You like the ponies?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Sure. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You bet the ponies?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Me? No. Not really.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Smart. Hard as hell to handicap. You know what
I like? Hai Alai. Fast game. You know why I like it?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: It’s fixed. That’s the only way to win. A sure
thing. See that horse. The blaze.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: This one?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yeah. The blaze. I bought her in ‘66. Hired a
trainer, stall, whatever it was. That horse made me over a hundred
grand. In ’sixties’ dollars. You know what that is today?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Pshhh…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: A million. Easy.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: She was fast, huh?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Never won a race. But it got me in with the
trainer. We’d have a thing, I don’t remember, some fucking thing. The
jockey would raise his whip, it meant the fix was in, we’d all go
running. People get greedy. First they bet small, they keep their mouth
shut. Within a month’s time, everyone and their brother was in on it.
The odds would drop, I mean you could watch the goddamn board. It looked
like a fuckin stopwatch, the odds would drop so fast.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: That’s why they call it the smart money.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I like you, kid. Why do you gotta make it so
hard for me to take care of you?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Mr. Reuben, I swear to God, they were out of
line.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Last time, maybe, with the Puerto Ricans, but
these were nice Jewish boys.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: They were out of line –</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: They’re fucking yeshiva buchas. You didn’t have
to tear up the goddamn place. You knocked out a guys teeth.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: That prick tried to get Jessica to blow him
in the bathroom –</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Bobby, I love Jessica like she’s my own
daughter. I would kill anyone so much as lays a finger on her or her
beautiful daughter, but that fucking pisher you socked in the mouth has
the most expensive dentist in Beverly Hills and wants I should buy him
an implant. Your silverback horseshit’s gonna cost me eight grand.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I’ll work it off.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Not driving Jess, you won’t.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You’re not driving Jess no more. Two strikes,
Bobby, and this last one was big. The bachelor’s father goes to my
schul.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: So, that’s it. I’m out?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I didn’t say that.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Then what are you saying?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Bobby. You’re a bull terrier and I got you
herding sheep.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: It’s my fault. I send you out to watch scum
drool all over the love of your life, then I wonder why you seered. It’s
my fault. The tooth is on me. But no more. I’m ‘reassigning’ you.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I don’t want to drive another girl, Max. The
only reason I’m –</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Who the fuck do you think you’re talking to?
This ain’t a fucking democracy. You want out?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Don’t I put food on you’re table? I sponsor
your training, I take care of your girl and her little baby. I even pay
that deadbeat friend of yours to push a goddamn broom.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Now you wanna shut up and listen and hear what
I got to say?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Yeah. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I got a way we make everybody happy.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: We try something out. There’s someone I’m in
business with named Ruiz. I want you to accompany him on a drop. Just as
scenery. Ruiz has his boys. I just want a big guinea with a busted up
face to give him a deep bench. As a deterrent.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Ruiz knows about this?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Ruiz wants to go alone, but it’s not up to
Ruiz. It’s up to me, and I like a sure thing. Just go and we’re square
on the tooth.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What about Ricky? He’d jump at the
opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Ricky? Ricky ‘I lost the truck’ Ricky?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You told him you liked him.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: That was before he lost my carpet cleaning
van.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: He’ll work it off.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I don’t know the kid, and what little I do
scares me.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: He’s good people, Mr. Reuben. I swear.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You vouch for him?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Yeah. Sure.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: How ’bout this. If you’re in, he’s in.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I gotta tell you, Mr. Reuben, I’m not
comfortable getting in any deeper. It’s one thing to look after
Jess…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You’re ready to move up. Christ, the way you
busted up the place, you’re doing worse already. May as well get paid
instead of punished.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: It’s not that I don’t appreciate the
offer…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Do me a favor. Think about it. Is that too much
too ask?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: No. Okay. I’ll think about it.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: We need guns.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: We don’t need guns.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: I think we might.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: He didn’t say we need guns.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: He implied it.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You don’t imply about something like that.
You lay it out on the table. Besides, I’m not taking the job.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: This is the opportunity of a lifetime. What
are you? Nuts? You’ve been waiting for this kind of opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: No. You’ve been waiting for this kind of
opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Damn right, I have. You think I like living
on fucking Yucca? We do a good job on this, we’re in.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What happened to boxing? I thought we made a
vow.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Shit. Who we kidding? I know I suck, and I
held you up for ten rounds –</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Bullshit…</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Please. I got three inches on you. You
wouldn’t have landed a punch if I didn’t let you.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You wanna go right now?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: I’ll beat your ass –</p>
<p><strong>coach</strong>: Ricky! Bobby! Cut that shit out!</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Sorry coach.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Sorry coach.</p>
<p><strong>coach</strong>: How’s the boxing going?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: He’s 5-5-1.</p>
<p><strong>coach</strong>: It takes time, Bobby. You always had the
heart.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: What about me coach? Did I have heart?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: We look good this year.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: We’ll kill Fairfax this year.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I still can’t believe you missed the fucking
team bus.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Fuck him.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Your first start at DB, it’s against Fairfax,
and you miss the fucking bus.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: What are we delivering?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: We’re not delivering shit. Ruiz is delivering
something, and whatever it is is his business.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Who is this fucking Ruiz?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Maxie says he runs a tight ship. I wouldn’t
fuck with him.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Some Mexican? How much could he weigh? A buck
fifty, tops? I’d kick his fucking ass.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I gotta pick up the baby.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Why do you always get stuck taking care of
the kid.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I like it.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: It’s not even yours.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I like it.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Nice work.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Shhh… Yeah, yeah… No. No. I’ll be there. You
gotta get me to the Magic Castle at four.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: How’d you unlock my phone?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: I tried your ATM PIN. I gotta kill an hour.
Let’s grab a beer.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Seat belt.</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: Ricky’s not wearing one.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Ricky, can you put on a seat belt?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: No, man. It wrinkles my shit. Let’s grab a
fuckin beer –</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: C’mon, man, not in front of the baby. Put on
your seat belt before I get another ticket.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Jesus Christ, fine. Alright?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: See? Now everyone’s got one on. What do you
got there?</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: A elephant seal. Where’s mommy?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: She’s, uh, sleeping.</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: It’s daytime.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Mommy works hard so you can have all your
pretty clothes. Don’t you like your pretty clothes?</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Show uncle Ricky what you made.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Let’s grab a beer.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Why can’t we just grab a goddamn beer.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I promised Chloe we’d come here.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Oh, give me a break. Look at her. She don’t
even know where the hell she is. She’d have more fun at Bordner’s.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I’m not taking her to a bar.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Why not? I grew up in bars. It’s fun for a
kid.</p>
<p><strong>salesperson</strong>: Excuse me, there’s no smoking in the
store.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Why? You serve food?</p>
<p><strong>salesperson</strong>: No. Store policy. And you can’t sit at
a station without purchasing a ceramic.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Could you believe this shit? Fine. Give me an
ashtray.</p>
<p><strong>salesperson</strong>: What color paints would you like?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Surprise me.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: I’m telling you, bro, we’re on the verge.
He’s reaching out to us.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What’s wrong, baby?</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: He’s not doing it.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: What? Did she say something?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: She wants you to paint the ashtray.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: I’m not painting the fu –, I’m not painting
the ashtray. And frogs aren’t purple.</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: It’s a poison arrow tree frog.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Will you paint the damn thing. Why do you
gotta be such a baby.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Fine. Here, look. I’m painting.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Max won’t let me drive Jess to dance
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Who’s driving her?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: This paint sucks. The white shows
through.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Right here’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Is that the woman from..?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: She really liked the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>jess</strong>: Here, sweety, mommy’s in a hurry.</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: I don’t want grilled cheese.</p>
<p><strong>jess</strong>: Mommy has to work.</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: I hate cheese.</p>
<p><strong>jess</strong>: Here, sweety. Don’t be a little shit.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Go finish getting ready. I’ll take care of
dinner.</p>
<p><strong>jess</strong>: Yeah? You sure?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Go.</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: You’re not my daddy.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You gonna bust my horns, or you want
spaghetti</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: I want spaghettis.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You better watch everything I’m doing. You
know why? Because that’s how you learn to cook. I watched my grandma
cook every night. That’s how I learned. If you can’t cook, then you
gotta go out to eat every night, then you spend all your money on food.
And when you eat in restaurants, the cooks scratch their ass and touch
the food.</p>
<p><strong>jess</strong>: Could you get that, baby?</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: What’s up? Jess ready?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You driving her?</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: She’ll be out in a minute.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: She’ll be out in a minute.</p>
<p><strong>jess</strong>: Hiya Ho. Come in. I’ll just be a minute.</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: Some shit smells good in this
motherfucker.</p>
<p><strong>jess</strong>: Bobby’s cooking. He’s the best. Whip him up
something.</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: Yeah. Whip me up something. I’m hungry as a
motherfucker.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Watch your mouth in front of the baby.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: No way that cocksucker’s driving you.</p>
<p><strong>jess</strong>: Maybe if you didn’t go Rambo every time I did
a lapdance, you’d still be doing it yourself. Meantime, I gotta feed my
little girl.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Maxie’s fucking with me. He put you with the
spook to get under my skin.</p>
<p><strong>jess</strong>: Ho’s a good guy –</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Ho’s a fucking pimp! He encourages Wendy to
turn tricks. And she’s his fucking wife!</p>
<p><strong>jess</strong>: Shhh. He’ll hear you.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Good! It’ll save me the trouble of repeating
myself. He’s not fucking driving you!</p>
<p><strong>jess</strong>: Listen to me, Bobby. This is my job. It puts a
roof over me and my daughter and you for as long as you want to
stay.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I want you to quit.</p>
<p><strong>jess</strong>: Look at the bills. I can’t. I’m not gonna put
my daughter through what I went through.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I’ll support you.</p>
<p><strong>jess</strong>: With what?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Max offered to stake me.</p>
<p><strong>jess</strong>: Yeah, well Max offers a lot of things. And I
got news for you. He’s not the sweet old man you think he is.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: She needs a family. A dad. I’ll give her what
you never had.</p>
<p><strong>jess</strong>: Don’t get my hopes up. If I quit, what then? I
can’t go through this again.</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: C’mon girl. Eat up.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Get away from her.</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: Excuse –</p>
<p><strong>jess</strong>: C’mon, Ho. We’re late.</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: Yeah. We got money to make. See you around,
Bobby. You make a good puttanesca. Mmmmm-mmmm. You should make that shit
for a living.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: This is the last time I speak to either of you
in person about work related matters. All of our interactions in the
future will be social. If you have any questions about anything work
related, you will direct them to Ruiz. He has my full confidence.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Everything you need or need to know is in these
envelopes. Do not –</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: open the envelopes until you have left this
office.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Can I borrow a piece of –</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Go ahead. Open the fuckin things. You should
each find fifteen hundred –</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: dollars in c-notes, a numeric pager, a double-A
battery, and a first class round-trip ticket to JFK.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: We’re going to New York?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yes. You’re going to New York.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: And the money. Where do we bring the
money?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: That money is your per diem.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: And where do we bring it?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: It’s ours.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: To keep?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yes, for expenses and such. Now, you’ll be
contacted on your pager as to where you should go. You each have been
given an extra battery, so there is absolutely no excuse as to why a
page would not be immediately returned. Am I making myself abundantly
clear?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You will not carry any other pagers with you.
You will not carry anything, for that matter, that I have not just given
you.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Keys.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: What about my keys?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You can carry your keys. You will not mention
my name or imply that you are in my employ. You will not speak to anyone
while you are working. When you are not working, you are considered to
be ‘on call’ and available twenty-four hours a day. This means you will
not get drunk or do anything that will prevent you from operating in a
professional manner. There is already a number in your pager’s memory.
It is a car service. When they ask you what account, you will respond:
‘Cardiff Giant.’ They will pick you up and take you anywhere you need to
go. In other words, there is no reason why you should not reach any
destination that you will be called upon to reach within fifteen
minutes. Do you see a pattern forming?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You want –</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Not you. I want Ricky to answer.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: I get it.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Don’t worry. I get it.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: So tell me how it is.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: You want… Why are you picking on me?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Because you lost my fucking carpet cleaning van
and I don’t like you.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I already told you, I parked it for five
minutes and I locked it with the club –</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You want us to be wherever you want us to be,
ASAP, no questions asked.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yes. Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: So, wait, what are we dropping off?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Holy shit. Can you believe this?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Pretty nice.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: See, man. Maxie fuckin takes care of you when
you’re in. Beats cleaning carpets.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What’s the movie?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: I’ll get the girl.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Nah, don’t bother –</p>
<p><strong>flight attendant</strong>: Champagne or orange juice?</p>
<p><strong>flight attendant</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Yeah, uh, what’s the movie?</p>
<p><strong>flight attendant</strong>: It’s in your copy of Hemispheres.
I believe it’s Mickey Blue Eyes.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Ugh…</p>
<p><strong>flight attendant</strong>: I’ll get you the list of videos,
if you don’t mind, I’ll offer the other passengers a beverage.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Yeah, sure. How much are they?</p>
<p><strong>flight attendant</strong>: How much is what?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: The videos.</p>
<p><strong>flight attendant</strong>: You’re up front. Everything’s free
up here.</p>
<p><strong>flight attendant</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Drinks are free, right?</p>
<p><strong>flight attendant</strong>: Yes. Would you care for another
one?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: I’ll have a Cutty on the rocks.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: You hear that? You can drink as much as you
want up here.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: We’re not supposed to get drunk. We’re on
call.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Unless we’re supposed to whack out the
fuckin’ pilot, I don’t think we’re gonna have to work in the next five
hours.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I don’t want to show up hammered. We’re
supposed to be representing Max.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Oh, I’ll represent alright.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Cut that shit out.</p>
<p><strong>flight attendant</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Where do you live?</p>
<p><strong>flight attendant</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Where do you live?</p>
<p><strong>flight attendant</strong>: I operate out of the Chicago
O’Hare hub. Can I help you with anything else?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Yeah. Me and my boy here are gonna be in New
York overnight. I want you to pass the word around to the honeys back in
business class that you all got plans for tonight. I’m talkin’ a
California style, Tupac, gangster pool party back at the hotel. And make
that drink a double.</p>
<p><strong>flight attendant</strong>: Listen, asshole, I don’t care if
you’re the Sultan of Brunei, no man talks to me like that. Now you can
either learn some manners or I can make a formal complaint to the
airport authorities and we can sort this out while you’re waiting
stand-by for the next flight to Kennedy.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Shit. No new pages. I don’t even know where
the fuck we’re supposed to go.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Maybe we should call for a cab.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: No. Look. There.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: ‘Cardiff Giant.’ That’s us.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: You sure?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Yeah. He said that’s our account with the car
service.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Hi. I, uh, think that’s us.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Hi. I’m Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Bobby.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Ricky.</p>

<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You’re going to the Soho Grand hotel,

<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I’m not sure. All I know is the account is
Cardiff Giant.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Yeah. You’re staying at the Soho Grand. You
got anything checked?</p>

<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Yeah. Grab one of the cards behind you. Call
that number. It’s my cell.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: So you’re our own private guy?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I handle most of Cardiff Giant’s stuff.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: You know my pager number?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: No. What is it?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: I don’t know. I thought you might. Any idea
what the job is?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: The ‘job?’ Alls I know is I’m taking you to
the Soho Grand.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Where is the Soho Grand?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Soho.</p>
<p><strong>bellman</strong>: …And here is the key to the mini- bar. Room
and tax has been picked up by Cardiff Giant, as well as one fifty in
incidentals.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: What’s ‘incidentals?’</p>
<p><strong>bellman</strong>: Phone, room service, mini-bar. Any
additional expense. If you need anything you can push the button marked
‘Concierge’, and they’ll be able to help you.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>bellman</strong>: Now, Mr. Slade, you’re in room 315.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Just give me the key. I’m gonna stay
here.</p>
<p><strong>bellman</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>

<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Is it the good room?</p>
<p><strong>bellman</strong>: All the suites are about the same.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Come on. Just tell me. It’ll save all the
trouble of you showing me all the rooms.</p>
<p><strong>bellman</strong>: Honestly, the suites are all about the
same.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: What if I gave you forty?</p>
<p><strong>bellman</strong>: It’s as good a suite as we have, unless you
want two bedrooms.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: No. That’s cool. Bring me back eighty.</p>
<p><strong>bellman</strong>: Thank you, sir.</p>

<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Nightlife. Where’s the hot ass?</p>
<p><strong>bellman</strong>: Women?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Yeah ‘women.’ If I was a fag I could get laid
in a subway.</p>
<p><strong>bellman</strong>: I don’t know, Forum’s pretty hot tonight.
It might be hard to get in, though.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Don’t worry about me getting in. Just tell me
where it is.</p>
<p><strong>bellman</strong>: It’s on West Broadway.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: See you later.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Yeah, take care.</p>
<p><strong>bellman</strong>: Thanks again. I’ll bring up your
change.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Hi girls, It’s Bobby. I’m here safe and
sound. I’m just calling to say I love you. I’d leave my number, but you
know you can’t call me here, so I’ll try you later. Uncle Ricky wants to
say hi… He says hi. Be home soon. Love you. Bye bye. Why don’t you want
to say hi? She likes you.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Who you calling?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Shhh… Hello, room service?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: C’mon, man…</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Yeah, bring up two burgers and a couple of
Heinekens. I’m in room… How’d you know? Oh. Yeah. How long? Cool.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: How much is it?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: How much? Okay. Make it fifteen minutes and

guy.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Ricky, who knows how long we’re gonna have to
be here. We gotta make it last.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Fine. I’ll put it on my room. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Don’t worry about it. Just be smart.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: But let me tell you, man, I don’t like your
attitude already.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Oh really. Why’s that?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: We just got moved up in the world. You gotta
let go of that blue collar mentality that was drummed into your head.
You gotta start owning it man, or they’ll smell you a mile away like a
cheap suit.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Who’s gonna smell me a mile away?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Don’t play dumb. You know what I’m talking
about.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I know you’re not calling Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: As a matter of fact I was. You got a problem
with that?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: We’re here representing Max. You’re acting
like a Puerto Rican on the fifteenth of the month.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: You think Maxie doesn’t want us to roll hard?
Why do you think he gave us all this bread? Or the number on the pager?
We gotta represent him by showing some class. The man’s got an
operation. How does it reflect on him if we nickel and dime it?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: It’s on West Broadway. We can walk.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Well, I don’t want to walk.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Motherfucker!</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: …How ’bout Jimmy? You know Jimmy the driver?
Cardiff Giant? You ever deal with them? Cardiff Giant?</p>

<p><strong>bobby</strong>: They asked who it was.</p>

about?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Don’t even start.</p>

this gig? You’ve been crawling up my ass for six months to get your name
on Maxie’s list, and here we are.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Look, man, I never met Ruiz, okay? I don’t
know what the fuck I’m picking up, what the fuck I’m dropping off, who
the fuck I’m meeting. All I know is Maxie’s still pissed at me cause I
sold his fucking van.</p>

that.</p>

<p><strong>ricky</strong>: You know he fucks all his girls, don’t
you?</p>

on this one, but it’s over. Shit’s gonna come down… Well, then, you got
my blessing. I’m selling my end. This internet shit’s too volatile. I’ll
keep my block of Microsoft, but I’m taking profits on Yahoo and all the
portal stocks. The bubble’s gonna pop, man… Alright, peace.</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: That’s it? This is Maxie’s cavalry? Who the
fuck swole you up like that?</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: Shit. If that shit don’t beat all. Maxie sent
me two fuckin broke ass swole up guineas from the West side. I coulda
signed up some hard local guineas for beer money. Ain’t that right,
Leo?</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: Sure. You boys want anything?</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: Yeah, bring us four fernet.</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: Four fernet.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: No. I’ll take a strega.</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: What, motherfucker? You drinking ‘the witch’
after dinner?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Yeah. That fernet tastes like tar. My
grandfather tried to give me that.</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: Some fuckin guineas he sent me. It’s midnight
and the motherfucker’s ordering an apertif.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: It’s a digestif.</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: Strega’s an apertif.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Fine. Bring me a Cynar.</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: Nigger, please. Don’t even order that
artichoke shit. West side guineas. Forget the drinks, Leo. We gotta
roll. What do I owe you?</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: We’re square.</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: Thanks, man. You need anything, you call.</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: You rode?</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: Jimmy? Ruiz. Pick up Maxie’s guineas at LUNA
and bring them to Spa. Jimmy’s bringing the car around. Me and Ho rode
sleds. We’ll meet you at Spa in the VIP room.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Where’s Spa.</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: Jimmy knows. 13th Street. We’ll meet you
there.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: How do you like that fucking moulinyan?</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: Maybe you two should wait out front.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: This shit’s sketchy. Why do they drop us in
the middle of nowhere to have the guy we’re supposed to meet come meet
us just to tell us we have to meet the same guy somewhere else?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Well, I thought you understood and I was just
missing it.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Missing what? He didn’t say shit.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Yeah, but you know Horrace. What did you get
off him?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What did I ‘get?’</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Yeah. What vibe?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I detected no vibe other than that Ruiz
thinks you’re a fucking idiot.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Yo, fuck him, man. Calling us guineas…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What do you give a shit what he calls us?
He’s not our friend. Let’s just get this shit over with and go home.
What’s this place we’re going to, Jimmy?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Spa?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Depends what night.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: A lot of Persians?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Not usually. Mostly Trustafarians.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: ‘Trustafarians?’</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You know, white kids with trust funds acting
like they’re poor. Keeping it real. Know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: I call ’em wiggers.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Different.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: This Ruiz guy, what’s his deal?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Don’t know much. I hear he runs a tight
ship.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Understand me?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: So is this the drop?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Like I said, I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: He woulda told us right?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You would think.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Watch out, man. Sorry. I’m on the list, man.
Hey, bro.</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: The line’s over there.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Yeah, but, we’re good. You know what I
mean?</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: How is it you’re good? You on a list?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Yeah. Ricky Slade.</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: You see a Ricky Slade?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Cardiff Giant?</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Cardiff Giant. Just check.</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: Maybe you wanna try the China Club.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Again with the fucking China Club! What do I
look like a fucking Persian to you?</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: Hey. I’m half Lebanese.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: We’re with Ruiz.</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: Ruiz isn’t here.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: We’re supposed to meet him here. Is Ruiz on
the list?</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: Ruiz is always on the list. He just ain’t
here, though.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Can you check?</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: He’s not here.</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: What’s up, man.</p>
<p><strong>screech</strong>: S’up.</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: You look big, man. Diesel. You been
lifting?</p>
<p><strong>screech</strong>: A little.</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: You look good, man.</p>
<p><strong>screech</strong>: Cool. See you later.</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: Cool.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Did you see that shit? Motherfucker. You let
in fucking Screech, dude? I’m waiting and you let in Screech?</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: He’s on the list.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Show me. Show me where it says Screech on the
fucking list.</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: What’s up, bro? You look big, man, you been
lifting?</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: A little. How’s it going tonight?</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: Shit’s off the chain. These two say they’re
with you.</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: Alright. These two are good.</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: Sorry, man, but…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Thanks a lot. Don’t worry about it.</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: Any time, bro.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: That’s him. Now you all know the drill,
right?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What drill?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: We don’t know any drill. Nobody told us
anything.</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: Maxie told you to keep your mouth shut while
you’re working, right?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: So we’re working?</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: What the fuck you think, I wanna ‘hang’ with
you motherfuckers? Yeah you’re working. And put down the champagne.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: She poured it for –</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: Far as she knows you’re John Gotti. Now put
the shit down and act like you got some ass.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: He making the drop?</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: Nah, man. He’s just making contact. That’s
our man. The Welsh guy.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What’s his name?</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: Ruiz don’t like using names on cell phones.
He refers to him as the Red Dragon.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: So, when’s the drop.</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: To be honest, man, I don’t know shit
either. All I know is it ain’t drugs and it ain’t now.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: How do you know it’s not drugs?</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: Maxie knows I don’t go near drugs. I did a
minute in Quentin for possession with intent. And it ain’t now cause he
woulda told me.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: You strapped?</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: ‘Strapped?’</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: It means you got a gun?</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: I know what ‘strapped’ means, motherfucker.
What the fuck you think this shit is? ‘21 Jump Street?’ Cool out,
they’re coming back. Just throw up your screw face and don’t speak
unless spoken to.</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: Here, man, sit down.</p>
<p><strong>welshman</strong>: I see you brought along the rogues
gallery.</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: Not really. Just some friends from out West.
This is Ho, Bobby, and Rick.</p>
<p><strong>welshman</strong>: And here I thought you flew in some out of
town muscle. How’s it going, men?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: So, you must be the Red Dragon.</p>
<p><strong>welshman</strong>: Well, that’s news to me. The name’s
Tom.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Mmmm-hmm. Where’s the, uh, ‘Dragon’s lair?’
Where do you live?</p>
<p><strong>welshman</strong>: Edinburgh.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: And where might that be?</p>
<p><strong>welshman</strong>: Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Well, word on the street is you’re Welsh.</p>
<p><strong>welshman</strong>: I am.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: A rose by any other name would –</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: Come here, there’s someone I want you to meet.
You like big tiddies?</p>
<p><strong>welshman</strong>: Well, who doesn’t?</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: What the fuck was you told? Don’t talk,
right?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Unless spoken to, ain’t that right, Horrace.
Didn’t you say that?</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: Don’t drag my ass into this –</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: He spoke to me. You want me to dis him?</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: ‘Dis?’ ‘Dis?’ You’re not in a position to
‘dis’, or ‘give props’, or whatever your Real World sense of fucking
decorum tells you to do. You’re nothing. You’re wallpaper. You’re not
here to make fucking friends. Asking a motherfucker where he lives. And
who the fuck told you ‘Red Dragon’?.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: We get it. We’re sorry.</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: Now that Limey motherfucker’s jumpy and wants
to change shit around on me. Maxie’s gonna shit a Nokia when he hears
about… Aw, shit, I better call him before he hears.</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: I’m not saying shit to neither of you.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Why? What I say bad?</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: What the fuck, ‘Red Dragon?’</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: What? Why am I bad?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: How bad is it?</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: It’s bad. Before you even showed up, he
said you were Maxie’s ‘token goons’, and not to be trusted. He wanted to
TCB alone. I was gonna ride shotgun to keep the English dude above
board. Now he’s spooked. This shit’s snowballing.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: When’s it going down?</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: Was gonna be tomorrow morning. Now, who
knows?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: See you later.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: You really in trouble?</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: Stop.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: I’ll tell him someone else told me.</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: Just don’t ask me no more shit.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You happy?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Why you gotta make everything difficult?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: You too?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Yeah, me too. You’re a fucking bull in a
china shop.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Fuck this.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Where do you think you’re going?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Back in.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You fucking nuts?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Work’s over. I’m gonna party.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You can’t go in there. They know you’re with
Ruiz.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: You got that right.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Fuck you. Go then. I’m taking the car.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Where to?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Look who’s back? Want some champagne?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Do not put this on Ruiz’s tab. Start a new
one.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Damn right. Bring us two bottles of Dom
Champs and here, take fifty in case I call you bitch later when I’m
drunk. Siddown, motherfucker. ‘Sex and paychecks.’</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: So, wait, you’re from where?</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Manhattan.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: You girls aren’t from Brooklyn or
anything?</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: I swear to God, we live in Manhattan.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: I don’t get it. What do you do?</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: We’re in Fashion.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: So you’re models?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: We rep lines? You know? Fashion?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: And you grew up in Manhattan?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Kinda. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: What do you mean ‘kinda?’</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: You ever heard of Whitestone?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: I don’t know about you guys, but I’m starting
to feel a really sexual vibe here.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: What happened? I thought we were playing
Truth or Dare.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Look at, ladies. I could sit here and take
turns throwing skittles at your ass all night. But I feel what you guys
are putting out there. I’m only a mirror reflecting what I’m getting
from you. And I’m saying yes to it. I’m shaking hands with it. I see the
road that you’re pointing down and I’m saying I’ll ride shotgun. And
when your foot slams on the accelerator, I won’t get scared. I’ll stand
up and let the wind blow through my long blonde hair. With my summer
dress clinging to my bosom yelling ‘Faster, Billy! Faster! Drive faster!
Faster yet – !’</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Hello… She doesn’t want to talk to you… No…
I don’t have to ask her. Let it go, Sean.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Will you leave me alone, already…? No,
Sean, it’s over… I don’t care… As a matter of fact, I am… Yeah. In his
hotel room…</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Holy shit.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: I’m having fun, Sean. Can you handle that…?
Yeah. He doesn’t judge me.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: I don’t wear a white wig, I don’t carry a
gavel.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: That’s a good idea, maybe I will!</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Are you alright.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Now you girls wait here. I got a special
surprise.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Is he cute?</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: He’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Should I fuck him?</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: I don’t know. Do whatever you want.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: He’s great, right. Is he great?</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: He’s alright.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: But maybe that’s okay. Maybe that’s just
what you need.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Can you excuse me for a minute?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What the fuck’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Dude, get back out there. You gotta help me
get them in the hot tub. Hang on girls! Just get out there. I’ll be
right out. You know how I do.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Yeah, I know how you do. I know how you do.
I’ve heard your kibbles and bits all fucking night. You’ve been shaking
your ass like an unemployed clown. How the room’s a boiling pot of sugar
water. How you’re gonna dip a string into it and make rockcandy. Who
wants to play ‘Just the tip?’ Dancing around like a smacked ass. Oh, and
that coat check girl you’ve been dragging around as ‘insurance’ doesn’t
even speak English.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Okay. We got a lot happening here. Here comes
the good part… Okay…</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Somebody’s getting comfortable.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Where’s the surprise?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: You want your surprise?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Yeah. I want it.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Well, come on then. It’s back here.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: You mind if I roll a joint?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: You want to come splash around.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: I’m just warning you, I can’t swim.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: I’m not like her, you know. I mean, I’m not
judging, but I’m more about my dogs. Do you have dogs? Are you a dog
guy?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: I want to leave right now.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: I didn’t do anything –</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What the hell did you do?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: I swear to God, I didn’t do anything.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Oh no. What is it this time.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: We used to take baths together.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Come on. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Sean? I want you to pick me up… I know. I’m
sorry too.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What the fuck was that about?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: She was jonesing for me.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Here you go, darling. Get home safe.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Fuck.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Hi. It’s Ruiz. Yeah. So the driver knows
where to go? When? We’ll be down in five. No, I’ll tell him. He’s right
there. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: He wants to see us now.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: He said it’s being arranged. He said Jimmy
will know.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: We’re getting whacked.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: We’re not getting whacked.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Why else you think he won’t tell us where the
sit down is?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: It’s not a ‘sit down.’ He said he’s telling
us the plan.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What are you doing.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: I got a bad feeling, man. I don’t want to go
in naked.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You gonna shank him in the shower?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Is it so unrealistic to think Ruiz, who
doesn’t even want us here, is throwing us to the wolves? As an apology?
And I don’t even know what we’re dropping off or picking up –</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: We’re getting ahead of ourselves. We haven’t
gotten any sleep. Let’s just keep our mouthes shut and not make any
mistakes. Now hurry up and get your shit on so we’re not late and make
things worse.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Put that shit out…</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: C’mon, man…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I swear to God, I’ll fucking puke.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Hey, Jimmy, where they taking us?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Yeah. Where they gonna whack us?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: If they’re whacking you, they’re doing it in
style.</p>
<p><strong>ext. tavern on the green - central park - morning -</strong>:
CONTINUOUS</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: Jesus Christ, where the fuck you been all
night? You look like you got shit out in the gorilla house.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: You think this shit’s funny, Ho?</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: Nah, man…</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: You think it’s funny, motherfucker?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Easy, Ruiz.</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: Don’t ‘easy Ruiz’ me. Y’all turned a Easter
egg hunt into a butt-fuck-a- thon. Bring me four eggs Benedict and a
mimosa. You all want mimosas?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Nah, man…</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: Four mimosas. You’ll love them. So here’s the
plan. I didn’t say shit to Maxie, cause the man has acute angina, and I
don’t want to get him all worked up.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: He has a cute what…?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: A bad heart.</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: I didn’t tell him shit. He worries too much. I
love that old Jew, but he’s gonna kill himself worrying. We started this
shit, and we’re gonna finish it.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Who’s gonna outfit us?</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: Outfit? What’s he talking about?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Nothing, man.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: You want us strapped, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: Last thing I want is you with a gun.</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: Word.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What’s the plan?</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: Tom, the Welsh dude –</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: The Red Dragon.</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: Shut it, man. Shut it. Tom is a square. He
don’t but dabble in shit. Maxie had me hook up a loan-back with him,
through an Austrian passbook account.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: So, we’re talking money laundering…</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: Will you tell Peter Jennings to shut up and
fucking listen. The shit’s as routine as you get. I coulda turned it
over offshore in a week, but Maxie likes to do it all his way. Safe. I
coulda dropped the bag alone. It’s only two hundred G’s. But he sent you
all. So I can either send you home and tell Maxie, or we can flush the
toilet one more time and hope it all goes down.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Let’s do it.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: I’m your soldier.</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: Now listen. The gig couldn’t be simpler. You
carry the money to the Welshman, he checks it, hands you his marker,
you’re done. The washed money goes directly to Maxie. Long as you hand
off the bag, you’re tight.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Where’s the drop?</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: You three are gonna meet him for dinner. Find
out if and where. Now any of you motherfuckers got anything else to
say?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: When all this is over and we’re not working
for Maxie, I’d love to run into you on the street. Why aren’t you
coming?</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: That’s none of your fucking business.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Why isn’t Ruiz coming?</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: This Welsh dude is tripping on Ruiz cause
he’s a Shot Caller.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: A Shot Caller. A boss, a Capo. He’s running
shit.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: The Welsh dude, sees all these niggers in
perms and diamonds and shit, he gets nervous. But you motherfuckers, he
just laughs. All beat up in your babaloo suit like Fruitpie the
Magician.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: So we just go eat with him and that’s gonna
solve everything?</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: Dude, you just gotta settle your shit down.
You gotta go and say all that ‘Red Dragon’ shit. Make him think he’s on
Barretta.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Like you were doing any better shucking and
jiving like you were waiting for wings outside the Quick and Split.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: So what do we do?</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: We go and hang out with the dude, make him
happy, drink some tea, whatever it takes, until he feels comfortable
enough to bring it up on his own. We make the drop, go home to
California.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Where is this happening?</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: We meet at the Globe on Park Avenue at six
forty-five. I’ll see you then.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Let’s check out the penguins.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: The what?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: The penguin house.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Wait a minute. You want to look at fucking
penguins now?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Yeah. Let’s look at the penguins.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Did you hear what he just said?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Whatever. We’re here. We may as well go to
the penguin house.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I’m tired and I’m scared, and I’m not looking
at fucking penguins.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: We need guns.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: We don’t need guns.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: I’m pretty sure we do.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I listened extremely carefully. Nothing was
even vaguely implied. He even laughed in your face when you asked
him</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: All the more reason.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You wouldn’t even know where to get one.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Wanna bet?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You couldn’t even get a hand job from bridge
and tunnel posse, how you gonna get a gun?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: That’s cause you decided to get all tired all
of a sudden.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: It was six in the fucking morning.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Float me a hundred bucks.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: You wanna see how fast I get a gun?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You’re out of money?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What do you have left?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Eighty.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Eighty bucks?!?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Eighty five.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What happened to the fifteen hundred?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: You coulda picked up a tab every once in a
while.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I did! I paid for half the fuckin drinks!</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: You did?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Yes I did. You asshole! What about the
room?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: What about it?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: They only cover one fifty in incidentals.
You’ve been ordering fucking… Motherfucker…</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Calm down.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I fucking vouched for you. I vouched for you
and you fucked me.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: This shit’s peanuts compared to what we’re
gonna make with Maxie.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Ricky. I’m trying to save this money.
Understand? I’m trying to make it so my girlfriend doesn’t have to grind
her ass into other men’s erections so her daughter can go to private
school.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: I’m sorry…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: This is horseshit. It coulda been so
easy.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: It’s gonna be fine.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: No more, man.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Let’s get some sleep. That’s what we need,
man. Sleep.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: How we gonna sleep? We only got a few hours
til dinner.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: So what do we do?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Let’s just go now and wait.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Three and a half hours?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I don’t want to take any more chances.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Let’s just go get guns, I’d feel better.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Don’t fuck around. You’re gonna get us all
killed.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Think about it: You knocked out that Jewish
kid’s tooth, cost him eight grand, maybe more. Maybe lost his whole line
of clientele? He knows you’re fucking up Jess’ dancing, and I got a
feeling he knows I stole his carpet cleaning van by the way he looks at
me. He can’t kill us in LA cause that leads to too many questions. So he
flies us out here first class for a ‘drop’ that’s turned into whatever?
He can make us disappear out here real nice…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Where do you get this shit?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Scenario B. I think I’m getting under Ruiz’s
skin. I’m no dummy. He doesn’t like how it went down with the Red Drag –
Welshman, whatever. Now I got Fruitpie the Magician telling me I can’t
call my man Max? And that Welshman’s sketchy. Whatever, I don’t know
where it’s coming, which way it’s coming from, I’m telling you one thing
right now, I’m not gonna be late for the dance.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You’re not getting a gun.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Hi girls. It’s Bobby. Can’t seem to get a
hold of you. Gonna be home soon. I miss you. Chloe, Uncle Ricky’s here.
He wants to say hello. Say hi to Chloe.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Hi Princess. It’s Ricky. I hope you’re doing
good sweety. Everyone’s okay. Nobody’s hurt… Talk to you soon. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Look. They’re together. You telling me this
ain’t a set-up?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Easy…</p>
<p><strong>welshman</strong>: Hey, boys.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Tom. How’s it going?</p>
<p><strong>welshman</strong>: Fine, fine. And you were…?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Bobby and Ricky.</p>
<p><strong>welshman</strong>: Right, right. The ‘thugs.’</p>
<p><strong>welshman</strong>: And where is…?</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: Ruiz? Oh, he ain’t here.</p>
<p><strong>welshman</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: Nah, see, Maxie just asked him to set that
shit up as a favor. He, you know, he tied in with the club. Set us up
so, you know, you feel at home.</p>
<p><strong>welshman</strong>: Well, I didn’t care for the club much.
And, I must say, I didn’t care for him either.</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: Well, he ain’t gonna be around no more.</p>
<p><strong>welshman</strong>: Pity. What’s say we have a drink?</p>
<p><strong>welshman</strong>: This is the greatest fucking country in
the world. I love this fucking place. I mean the food, the women, the
fucking curbs. This country has the highest fucking curbs in the world.
It’s fucking brilliant. You know what I love most? This shit.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Dip?</p>
<p><strong>welshman</strong>: Yeah. This shit’s fucking brilliant. I
just fucking love the fact that you have kids driving around in pickup
trucks with a mouthful of this shit, speeding their brains out. I gotta
bring a case of it home to my mates. It’s illegal back home, you
know.</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: No shit?</p>
<p><strong>welshman</strong>: Does anyone want another?</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: You want another drink?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: I’ll get it.</p>
<p><strong>welshman</strong>: Who’s up for a night on the town.</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: Sure. Anyplace in particular?</p>
<p><strong>welshman</strong>: I hear the China Club is a laugh.</p>
<p><strong>welshman</strong>: Bloody hell! Brilliant! Did you see
that?</p>
<p><strong>welshman</strong>: Now, about the business at hand…</p>
<p><strong>welshman</strong>: Anyone have any drugs.</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>welshman</strong>: A little Charlie, perhaps.</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: Coke?</p>
<p><strong>welshman</strong>: I’ve heard you’ve got the best coke in the
States. The shit back home is pants.</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: That shouldn’t be a problem.</p>
<p><strong>welshman</strong>: You guys are the fucking best. I swear, I
didn’t know about this whole thing, but you guys are okay.</p>
<p><strong>welshman</strong>: God love you…</p>
<p><strong>welshman</strong>: Aw, fuck me. Sorry…</p>
<p><strong>welshman</strong>: Sorry, mates. Now there isn’t even enough
to go around…</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: Don’t worry, man. It’s all for you.</p>
<p><strong>welshman</strong>: No, really, mate?</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: Here…</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Ow, shit…</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: Watch it…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: C’mon…</p>
<p><strong>welshman</strong>: Fuck…</p>
<p><strong>welshman</strong>: Fuck, that’s good shit. So, what’s say we
make a go of this and you drop off the cash tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: Now, here’s what worries me. He said he
wants to meet up at a bar in Red Hook. You know where that is?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: Brooklyn.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: He must have that shit troughed.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What do you mean ‘troughed?’</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: Troughed off. Protected. Like, you know,
like he got a moat around it.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Ruiz tied in out there?</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: Nah, man. No one is. They got some Puerto
Ricans and a new crop of fuckin Irish immigrants.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: I’m half Irish.</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: I don’t fuck with those crazy, off-
the-boat fuckin Irish. You heard of the Westies?.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Heard of them.</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: They ran shit back in the Eighties. Used to
cut motherfuckers heads off and sit them on the bar. That’s back when
the Irish was making a play against the Italians. I don’t know if they
still around, but I don’t fuck with those motherfuckers just in
case.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: It sounds to me like everybody’s just a
little jumpy. And since all it is is a drop, the Welshman’s got nothing
at stake. I say we go to his ‘troughed off’ bar. It’ll calm his nerves,
we drop the bag, and we all get back to our lives.</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: And not a word to Maxie. He’ll shit if he
knew we crossed a bridge.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Get up brother. We’re home. Go up and get
some sleep.</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Chloe?</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: Uncle Bobby?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Hi, baby. What are you doing awake? Where’s
mommy?</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Mommy’s not home?</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What time is it there?</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: Can you take me to Color Me Mine?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Yeah. Are you sure mommy’s not home? It’s
very late.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I gotta go, baby. I love you. Tell mommy I
called. You be a big girl and be careful when you’re alone.</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: I love you. Come home.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Yeah…? Now…? Did Ricky call yet…? See you in
a minute.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Aren’t we waiting for Ricky?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Ricky’s taken care of.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Taken care of?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Yeah, he’s getting there on his own.</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: Yeah… Yeah… Uhu… I can’t really talk now,
but it’s all going as planned. If things change, I’ll call.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Where we going?</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: Quick drop. In and out.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Where’s Ricky?</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: Ricky’s taken care of.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: How so?</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: He was uptown when I paged him. I gave him
the address. He’s meeting us there.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: That it?</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: This is it.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Where’s Ricky.</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: I guess inside. Or he never made it. Either
way, I don’t give a shit. Let’s get this over with.</p>
<p><strong>welshman</strong>: Here they are, then.</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: How’s it going?</p>
<p><strong>welshman</strong>: Brilliantly. Care for a pint?</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: No, thanks, man. We got to head out.</p>
<p><strong>welshman</strong>: Come, now. You just got here.</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: That’s alright, man. It’s a little early
for me to drink.</p>
<p><strong>welshman</strong>: Nonsense. We’ll have three half pints of
lager.</p>
<p><strong>welshman</strong>: Sorry about that. Where’s your mate?</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: Couldn’t make it. Here’s the money.</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: Give me your marker, and we’ll be on our
way.</p>
<p><strong>welshman</strong>: I can’t yet vouch for the amount, unless
you want me to sit here and count.</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: No, man, that’s fine. Just put that you
took delivery.</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: What the fuck, man? Why? The money’s in
your hand. Why you pulling this shit?</p>
<p><strong>welshman</strong>: I… I just hired these guys to watch my
back…</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: Motherfucker, we’re handing you money. What
the hell we gonna pull?</p>
<p><strong>rogue</strong>: Shut your goddamn mouth! As far as any of you
are concerned, a gang of spics took the bag. Understood? Grab their
wallets. I’ll know where to find each and every one of you.</p>
<p><strong>welshman</strong>: I didn’t know, I swear to God, I –</p>
<p><strong>horrace</strong>: If you and your boy set this up, you’re way
out of your league.</p>
<p><strong>rogue</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Maybe you’re the one who better shut up.</p>
<p><strong>rogue</strong>: He’s only got six shots, he’s bound to
miss.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Or maybe I’m real lucky. I’ll tell you one
thing, I’ll waste every bullet making sure you’re dead if you don’t take
that knife away from my friends throat.</p>
<p><strong>thug</strong>: That’s a starter pistol.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>thug</strong>: His gun’s a starter pistol. I can see the red
plug in the barrel.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Are you willing to risk your life over –</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: That’s enough.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You guys, over in the corner. Leave the
hardware and your wallets on the table. Make out an invoice on damages.
You got e-mail? E-mail it to me. A check will arrive. Call the number at
the bottom and tell them the Rook is code four. Then destroy the card.
Nice. I’ll let Maxie know you’re good in the pocket. Staduch. Go. I’ll
take care of this.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Holy shit. Get me back to Manhattan.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Take us right to Kennedy. Now.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You did good.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I never intended to test you two to that
extent, but you both came through. I should’ve been informed there was a
flag on the play, but I’ll take that up with Ruiz. I made a few calls
back East. Those punks weren’t tied in with anyone. As for the Welshman,
he wasn’t in on it. He was just plain dumb. As for you, Ricky, your draw
will go towards a new carpet cleaning van.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: But, Max –</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: We’re square.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: And, as for you, Bobby, you just moved up a
notch. Your days of fighting for crumbs is through. Take a week off,
come back, and we’ll talk about the next thing.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: There won’t be a next thing.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Take a few days –</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I don’t need a few days. I’m gonna settle
down with Jess. She’s through dancing. We’re opening a restaurant.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I hate to ruin your fairy tale, but I’ve been
paying Jess’ rent for six months. She’s got to keep dancing –</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: She’s through too. Thank you for the
opportunity, Max. We’ll see you around.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You got a lot to learn, kid. Say hi to Jess for
me.</p>
<p><strong>ext. jessica’s house - blackburn - los angeles - continuous
-</strong>: NIGHT</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Dude, we were practically made…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I’ll drop you off in a minute. I want to see
if the baby’s up. You wanna come in?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: No. I’ll wait here.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I’ll be a minute.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Where’s mommy? Did she leave you alone
again?</p>
<p><strong>horny guy</strong>: I – I – I… Don’t…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I don’t get it.</p>
<p><strong>jess</strong>: I never promised you anything.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: How could you let her see this?</p>
<p><strong>jess</strong>: Goodbye, Bobby.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Just so you know, I bought you out with
Maxie. I suggest you leave while you can.</p>
<p><strong>jess</strong>: Don’t you get it? I don’t want to leave. This
is who I am.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Tell you the truth, I don’t give a shit for
me. But that little girl is so special, and you’re gonna fuck her
up.</p>
<p><strong>jess</strong>: Take her.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What’d you say?</p>
<p><strong>jess</strong>: I want you to take her with you.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I, uh… Listen, hon. Mommy thinks it’s a good
idea if, just for a while, if you and me go on a trip –</p>

<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Baby, you got the sweetest voice I ever
heard, but Uncle Ricky’s gotta sleep. I’ve been driving all night,
Princess.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Shhh, c’mon, baby. It’s quiet time. Isn’t it
quiet time, Bobby? Bobby? Tell her it’s quiet time Bobby. Please tell
her it’s quiet time…</p>
