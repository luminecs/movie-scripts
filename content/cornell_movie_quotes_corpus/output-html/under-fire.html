<p><strong>price</strong>: ’Morning, Jimmy, think you could squeeze me

Mr. Price?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Bang-bang.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Twenty dollar.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: You’re a thief, Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Booteeful picture, huh, snap-snap?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: I don’t do skies.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Hi, guys.</p>
<p><strong>oates</strong>: G’damn, Price, you tuna sucking piece of raw
meat – whatchyou goin’ to Zambeze for?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Thought I’d get some great shots of your head
gettin’ blown to smithereens.</p>
<p><strong>oates</strong>: Smithereens?! Be a great fuckin’ picture,
eh?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Be a prize winner.</p>
<p><strong>oates</strong>: Ya think so? Trade ya some greenies for a
joint. I gotta have a joint.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: I’m on the wagon, man, sorry.</p>
<p><strong>oates</strong>: Ahh. Dope-wise, this place sucks. Lotta
fuckin’ coons around here, eh?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: I thought you were fighting for the
Government?</p>
<p><strong>oates</strong>: I am. This is the Government.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: These are the Rebels.</p>
<p><strong>oates</strong>: Fuck they are. This is a Government convoy to
Calunda.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: This is the Abou-Deian Revolutionary
Front.</p>
<p><strong>oates</strong>: You’re shitting me.</p>
<p><strong>oates</strong>: These guys be pissed if they knew, eh? This
is the dumbest motherfucker I ever signed up for. Don’t pay shit either.
Nicaragua. That’s the spot. Cheap shrimp, lotta rays – real thin in the
spook department too, dig?</p>
<p><strong>oates</strong>: Well hell… I wonder where the fuckin’ Guvmint
is?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Hold it! Hold it!</p>
<p><strong>p.o.v. the framed image – soldiers, smoke and coke in
b.g.</strong>: As the soldiers move toward the Coke, Price snaps picture
after picture.</p>
<p><strong>oates</strong>: Well, I guess we know where the Guvmint
is.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: You can walk to work from here.</p>
<p><strong>oates</strong>: Convenient, ain’t it?</p>
<p><strong>oates</strong>: My brother just got married.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: I don’t know your brother.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>oates</strong>: Great shit, eh?</p>
<p><strong>oates</strong>: U.S. Gummint offers this house to any Cuban
pilot flying Migs for the Rebels who chooses to defect to America with a
Russian jet. We know they ain’t gonna run off with no planes – but the
Rebs don’t – They’re scared. They start thinking about that swimming
pool. Damn near smell that chlorine. Starts workin’ on ’em, and pretty
soon they don’t let the Cubies near a Mig. Use their own spook pilots
and destroy their own air force in a week. Guaran-fuckin- teed.</p>
<p><strong>oates</strong>: Smartest guys in the world. Hey, you gotta
scoop here, eh? You’ll be famous.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>oates</strong>: I gotta run… have a good one.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: I love Africa.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: “…and so this strange war that features two
provincial governments, three rival liberation fronts, and at least
twenty-five tribal associations, grinds into its seventh year…”</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: “…The Battle for the Airfield at Abou Deia
is just another chapter in this endless story. From Ndjamena, Chad, this
is Claire Stryder.” No – you didn’t hear any music – must be the
connection. Okay? So long.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Alex, don’t play that God damn thing when
I’m filing. We’re late.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: It’s my party – we’ll be late. You called it a
“strange war” and an “endless story.” If you filed that story for me,
I’d say you were editorialishing.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I like to editorialize. You drunk?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Drunk? Only with the memories of making love
with you on the plains of Fianga as the first Army of Liberation marched
in and opened fire.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: And freed the Proletariat.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I’m going to the party without you.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Christ, I don’t want to go to this stupid
party. I’m bad at false modesty.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: You’re great at it.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Alex, you’re going to make a great anchorman
in New York and undoubtedly I could be a Pulitzer Prize winning hostess
– but I’m not going with you.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: You can work out of the East Coast. We’ll get
a place on Long Island and burn our suitcases.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I still like suitcases.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Every Saturday night we’ll have a party…
invite all our friends, sit out on the veranda and interview each
other.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I’ve done all that.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I haven’t. Well, God dammit, I’m getting tired
of memorizing who’s the president of the… Republic of Maldives.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Mamoon Abdul Gayoom.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Yeah, he succeeded Mamoon Abdul Gayeem.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: And I’m tired of Third World elevators.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Don’t leave me.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I already have.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Fuck Abou Deia and New York. I’m going to
Nicaragua with you.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I’ve heard it’s a neat little war with a nice
hotel.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Alex, get up here!</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: To the man who gave me my first job, and
fired me from my first job… and gave me my second job…</p>
<p><strong>voice from crowd</strong>: And fired you from your second
job…</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Just a few words, Alex.</p>
<p><strong>voices from crowd</strong>: Impossible! Can’t be done!
etc.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: You may be asking yourself what exactly are
you doing here in this “strange war, just another chapter in an endless
story… that grinds into its seventh year…”</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Oh. I didn’t know you were here.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Sure you did. You were taking pictures of me
all over the room.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Well… yeah… you looked great. Why aren’t you
partying?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: In a minute.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: I printed that up for Alex.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: It wouldn’t be the greatest thing you could
give him right now… We just split up.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Jesus, I’m sorry. Who left who this time?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I’m the villain… I thought it could be a
little cleaner this time – me in Central America, him in New York.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: That’s pretty clean.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: But he’s decided to go to Nicaragua too.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: To cover you or the war?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: To cover everything.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: For godsakes, Russell, listen.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: I don’t want to wait for you again. We’ve
been circling each other since the Montreal Olympics.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: You’re a genius of bad timing. I’m going
back to the party.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: This is a great shot.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I’ve heard the light in Nicaragua’s even
better.</p>
<p><strong>close on: time magazine with cover photo of the
elephants,</strong>: gradually PULL BACK to reveal other magazines,
candy, cigars, Nicaraguan toys, all in a corner shop, and finally:</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Wait here.</p>
<p><strong>teenage boys</strong>: Rafael, Rafael, Rafael… libre o
muerte… Rafael…</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Welcome to Managua.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: You have something to do with this?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Well… I thought of calling your photographs
“Pictures from a Lost War”… I’m great at captions – the New York editors
loved it since none of them knew where the hell Chad was anyway – it
legitimized their ignorance, got you a cover, me a feature, and packaged
a class struggle in two words. Nifty, eh?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Nifty.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: I’m Russell Price.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I’m sorry… this is Isela Cruz. She works for
the hotel and helps out as a translator.</p>
<p><strong>isela</strong>: My pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Looks like you guys have a lot of bang-bang
down here, eh? Little misunderstanding between the poets and the
government?</p>
<p><strong>isela</strong>: “Misunderstanding?!” “Down here” it’s called
a war. It started in nineteen thirty. Before you were born.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: My Spanish is a little out of shape – what’d
he say?</p>
<p><strong>isela</strong>: He said he considers it an honor to be able
to photograph our war.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Russell’s got a way with words.</p>
<p><strong>isela</strong>: I can tell.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: You’re a helluva translator.</p>
<p><strong>isela</strong>: I know. I’m much in demand around here. Will
you excuse me? If you have any questions, just ask.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Who is Rafael?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: It depends who you ask.</p>
<p><strong>isela</strong>: Rafael? Comandante Rafael. He is either a
Marxist dupe of Russia and Cuba… …or the most popular leader of a most
popular democratic revolution. Take your pick.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: I don’t really give a damn… but the guy’s got
a great face.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: How would he like to be photographed?</p>
<p><strong>isela</strong>: You’d never find him.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Wanta lay odds?</p>
<p><strong>isela</strong>: You would lose. You must excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Just one more thing – is Rafael owned by the
C.I.A. or the K.G.B.? I’ll figure out the rest.</p>
<p><strong>isela</strong>: Mr. Price… the world is not divided into East
and West anymore. It is divided into North and South. By the time you
people figure that out – it will be too late. Congratulations on your
cover.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: So far this war’s got it all over Africa.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: You’re gonna have a ball.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Hands off. I need an interpreter more than you
do right now.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: You still hanging in there with Claire?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I’m hanging in there like an interim post-war
government waiting for the palace to be overrun… by younger men.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Younger men.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Hi, Alex… Russell! When did you get in?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Just now.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: You’re not going to believe this – I just
beat you guys and everybody else here to a story… …exclusive… eat your
heart out.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: What’d ya get?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I’ve just been promised a private interview
with Tacho.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Congratulations. The bastard won’t talk to
me.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Who’s Tacho?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: That’s President Somoza’s nickname.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: I don’t know who the players are yet.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Want me to order you a hot dog and a
program?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Fellas! No fighting after six at night, all
right? Curfew. C’mon, we’ve all got something to celebrate.</p>
<p><strong>boy photographer</strong>: Sometimes it doesn’t work.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Let me look.</p>
<p><strong>daisy</strong>: Ladeez and Gen’mun, hep me get Aaleex ov’
here…</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: There’s not many piano bars left where I’m
still welcome.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: If she can’t sing in the key of C I’m in
trouble.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: “Well”… you finished your assignment in
Chad?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Got Africa all wrapped up and pouched to my
editor.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: You’re going to love this war, Russell…
there’s good guys, bad guys, cheap shrimp… And Alex is still singing in
the background. I missed you.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: We gotta get alone somewhere to talk.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Sometimes I wonder why I spend these lonely
nights, Dreaming of a song…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Jesus… he’s doing it on purpose.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Alex is one of the world’s leading experts on
military strategy.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Well, hell, I just got off the boat… gimme
the scoop on Nicaragua…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Well… about sixty years ago the U.S. Marines
invaded to protect American business interests and put down a peasant
revolt led by a little man who wore a giant cowboy hat – his name was
Augusto Sandino… In nineteen thirty-four he was murdered at a peace
conference, and the Somoza family has ruled ever since…</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: No, no, no… I don’t mean the stuff about the
peasants – I mean the real stuff.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: The “real” stuff?… you mean a history of
class struggle in agrarian societies?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: No, c’mon!</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Oh. Okay… well… Just a couple things. One –
there’s only two kinds of beer available – Tona and Victoria. Victoria’s
better. And two – if you see Miss Panama hanging around the hotel bar –
hot, hot, hot – but don’t touch. She belongs to Tacho, and if anybody
gets caught with her then El Presidente has promised to personally cut
off the guy’s…</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Pecker?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Yeah… and throw it into Lake Managua.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: And the lake’s already polluted.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Is there anybody here we don’t know?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>regis</strong>: G’damn, Price… kudos on the African snaps.
Jeez, Claire, I haven’t seen you since…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Three Mile Island.</p>
<p><strong>regis</strong>: Yeah… shit… Holiday Inn, right?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Jesus… Louis Jordan walks in, and I’m
sitting with the Everly Brothers.</p>
<p><strong>regis</strong>: Before you fall in love – that’s Marcel Jazy…
friend of wine, women, and Somoza. They say he’s a businessman…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: He’s a businessman in search of a business…
he doesn’t try very hard to cover up his connections to the</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: But look at his moves – can the C.I.A. light
cigarettes like that?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: What’s wrong with the Everly Brothers?</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Please stay at your table, and you won’t be
hurt.</p>
<p><strong>two masked faces – the couple – enter through the
front</strong>: DOOR The woman carries an automatic rifle and guards the
entrance.</p>
<p><strong>a woman guerrilla has a gun at the head of a
nicaraguan</strong>: BUSINESSMAN The middle-aged, well-dressed local
sits with his wife and two other men. They freeze in fear, the nightclub
freezes, as the GUERRILLAS take control of the room swiftly and
smoothly.</p>
<p><strong>guerrilla leader</strong>: We do not want to waste any
ammunition on a head as empty as yours – but we will.</p>
<p><strong>businessman</strong>: What is this?!</p>
<p><strong>guerrilla leader</strong>: Shut up! Get up!</p>
<p><strong>guerrilla leader</strong>: You are coming with us – you will
not be hurt – we will trade you for the release of some Nicaraguans who
care about Nicaragua.</p>
<p><strong>the bandmembers – including alex – back away from

clanging clash of cymbals startles everyone, and as the drama
freezes:</p>
<p><strong>the kitchen door swings open, and the boy photographer
emerges</strong>: Innocently, the young boy struts out of the kitchen to
see what’s going on, and as he does the DOOR STRIKES THE ARM OF THE
GUERRILLA WITH THE GRENADE, and:</p>
<p><strong>time stringer</strong>: …it’s Charlie, from New York – says
that a terrorist bombing of a Central American restaurant isn’t big
enough to hold for the world section…</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Tell him we have pictures.</p>
<p><strong>young journalist</strong>: He knows.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Tell him there were pieces of body in the
piano, and somebody was singing, “I Left My Heart in San Francisco.”
What’s he got better than that?</p>
<p><strong>time stringer</strong>: He’s got the Pope visiting Egypt.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Forget the Pope, Charlie. Every week you got
the Pope somewhere. This is a very big story down here because it’s the
first sign of fighting in Managua. Yeah, well get a map and look up
Nicaragua – ya drive to New Orleans and turn left.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Like hell I’m editorializing, the whole thing
happened in a roomful of C.I.A. and press. What do you want?! How do I
know they were C.I.A.? They wore name tags, what do you think? We’re
backing a Fascist again – I know that ain’t news, but see if you can
find an angle!</p>
<p><strong>hub</strong>: Hey! There’s fascists and then there’s
fascists, right? Be careful how you throw words like that around.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: We don’t have any pictures of Rafael because
nobody knows where the son of a bitch is, and anybody crazy enough to go
after him…</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: …is liable to get his nuts shot off.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Yeah, well g’bye… Who the fuck are you?</p>
<p><strong>hub</strong>: Hub Kittle. I’m with Lewitsky and Knupp – New
York. We have a client down here.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>hub</strong>: President Somoza.</p>
<p><strong>hub</strong>: I know, I know… But there’s an untold story
here. I mean, the man has a point of view too, right?</p>
<p><strong>hub</strong>: We got a national anthem contest going on right
now, and you guys are ignoring it. Lotta human interest.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I want you to get me copies of the
Government inventory lists of all captured Guerrilla weapons. I want to
know if the guns are Israeli, Belgian, Russian, Cuban…</p>
<p><strong>young woman</strong>: The Guerrillas are not supplied by
anybody from the outside.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Fine – give me proof.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Su hija, su hija! Your daughter from Los
Angeles.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Hi, baby! How are you? Has Grandmother
spoiled you silly by now? She has? Good. Yes, I got your letter with the
picture of your new boyfriend. He’s very good looking… but he’s a bit
old, isn’t he? No? Just how old is he?…</p>

Priest for you to confess your sins.</p>
<p><strong>prisoner priest</strong>: Cigarillo?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Priest? What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>prisoner priest</strong>: The government accused me of using
the church to hide Rebels and guns.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Governments are always wrong, eh?</p>
<p><strong>prisoner priest</strong>: This time they’re right. Who are

<p><strong>price</strong>: Un periodista.</p>
<p><strong>prisoner priest</strong>: Whose side are you on?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: I don’t take sides. I take pictures.</p>
<p><strong>prisoner priest</strong>: No sides?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>prisoner priest</strong>: Periodista Puta, todos periodistas
son putas.</p>
<p><strong>prisoner priest</strong>: Go home.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Mi amigo – mala interpretacion, eh?
Periodista, comprende? Famoso. Time magazine.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Soy un periodista.</p>
<p><strong>senior guard officer</strong>: Mr. Price… you must accept our
deepest apologies for the misunderstanding. Somebody saw you taking
photographs of terrorists hooligans in the parade and at the nightclub –
our young officers get carried away… they’re always looking for
traitors.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: That film is half way to New York by now.</p>
<p><strong>senior guard officer</strong>: I know, I know… It was all a
misunderstanding… una mala interpretacion. Your cameras.</p>
<p><strong>senior guard officer</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>senior guard officer</strong>: This way.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: You throw a journalist in jail – it gets in
the papers. You walk all over the same press credentials you pass out. I
demand to speak to someone in authority or I’ll go to Tacho myself… I
don’t understand you – you’re big and strong and handsome but you’re not
so smart! You should be trying to seduce us!</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Senora…</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Claire!</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: You’re okay?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: I’m fine – what’re you doing here? These guys
are goons.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: They love being beaten up by a woman I’ve
been looking for you all night – why’d they lock you up?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: I don’t know. Taking pictures. The usual.
Jazy got me released.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Jazy?! You think there’s a story there?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Ahh… C.I.A. stories are all alike. I wanta
find Rafael.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: You need help?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: No. You?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: No. When should we start.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: I figure you probably want to do a little
research on the history of Marcel Jazy’s business connections in the
third world countries with C.I.A. influence…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Oh. I assumed you’d just look him in the eye
and say “Gimme a break, for crissakes, Marcel, are you a spy or aren’t
you?”</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: …are you a spy or aren’t you, eh?</p>
<p><strong>jazy</strong>: Spy is such an odd word, Mr. Price… nobody is
a… ‘spy’… anymore.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Russell prefers pictures to words…</p>
<p><strong>jazy</strong>: You don’t have to apologize… you’re
journalists.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: And you’re a businessman?</p>
<p><strong>jazy</strong>: A businessman? That sounds good. Okay, I’m a
businessman.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Why was I arrested, and why did you get me
released, and who are you?</p>
<p><strong>woman in swimsuit</strong>: No agua.</p>
<p><strong>jazy</strong>: No agua.</p>
<p><strong>woman in swimsuit</strong>: Oh, Marcel! You told me there
would be water in the pool this week!</p>
<p><strong>jazy</strong>: If she dove in, I assure you she wouldn’t
notice.</p>
<p><strong>jazy</strong>: Sweetheart, the Guerrillas knocked out the
pumping station on the road to Masaya, and we must ration water for the
time being. Next week maybe things will be better.</p>
<p><strong>woman in swimsuit</strong>: Maybe I should go back to
Panama.</p>
<p><strong>jazy</strong>: Maybe you should.</p>
<p><strong>jazy</strong>: You were arrested because the Guardia are
clowns who specialize in excess. You were released because I told them
to release you.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: These are not the normal duties of a
businessman.</p>
<p><strong>jazy</strong>: But they are the normal duties of a… spy, eh?
You win, I’m a spy. There, are you happy? I feel better.</p>
<p><strong>jazy</strong>: Now we can relax. You can turn off your little
thing.</p>
<p><strong>jazy</strong>: Oh, I trust you won’t say anything to hurt me.
In some ways I’m a terrible spy. I used to be much better at it, but now
it seems everyone knows who I am. I have too many girlfriends. I like to
be photographed. I talk too much.</p>
<p><strong>jazy</strong>: I always talk too much… but my girlfriends
like that… No matter. You know who she is?</p>
<p><strong>claire and price</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jazy</strong>: That’s Miss Panama. Do you know who that
is?</p>
<p><strong>claire and price</strong>: Oh, yeah, yes, etc.</p>
<p><strong>jazy</strong>: She’s in love with me. I’ve got to get some
water in the pool. And once a week I have lunch with President Somoza to
discuss security measures against the Sandinista insurgents, but all he
wants to talk about is Miss Panama… he’s worried about her.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Because he thinks she’s seeing another
man?</p>
<p><strong>jazy</strong>: …and he assigned me to find out who the man
is.</p>
<p><strong>jazy</strong>: We all know the Revolutionaries are going to
win, don’t we?</p>
<p><strong>their p.o.v. as miss panama stretches like an enormous
cat</strong>: They all are slightly entertained and glad for the
relief.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: There’s a rumor about this picture. Some
people say you’re a genius – that you invented this scheme.</p>
<p><strong>jazy</strong>: It was lots of people’s idea… Have you been to
Leon?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: We’re going to Masaya… they say the Rebels
have hit the cuartel.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: It’s supposed to be nasty there… a lotta
people think Rafael’s in the South. I want to find out.</p>
<p><strong>jazy</strong>: No, no, it’s not “nasty” yet. Another week
maybe. You would love Leon. A nice cathedral and beautiful light… et un
peu de bang-bang.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: We’re not doing a travelogue, you
understand.</p>
<p><strong>jazy</strong>: Of course, of course… only I have heard that
Comandante Rafael has recently had his unit in the area.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Rafael is near Leon?</p>
<p><strong>jazy</strong>: Well… it’s a rumor, what do I know?</p>
<p><strong>miss panama</strong>: Estoy desemperado!</p>
<p><strong>jazy</strong>: She’s lonely!</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Don’t let us stand in the way.</p>
<p><strong>jazy</strong>: It’s my job. You think I talk too much?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Did you dream about Miss Panama last
night?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: I dreamed about you.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Have a good time?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Yeah… so’d you.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: And old war injury flaring up?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Is the tape on?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: I was on the deck of the U.S.S. Pueblo
catching some rays when the North Koreans attacked… took a bullet right
in the chest, but by luck I had an extra roll of high speed ektachrome
in this pocket right here… over the heart…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: And the bullet ricocheted off the film,
grazed your cheek, and saved your life.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: You heard about it?! I was lucky.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Did anyone ever die next to you in
combat?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: What did you do?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: F.8 at a sixtieth.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: That’s an old joke. My question was
serious.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: So was I. You ever dream about me?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Once.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: How was I?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Fast.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I’m basically a coward, Russell, I hope you
understand that. I hope we don’t get shot.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Me too.</p>
<p><strong>p.o.v. leon as a plane circles firing rockets and smoke
rises</strong>: from several places in the town. The sound of
gunfire.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I thought it was quiet here.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Quiet? Are you sure you want to go down
there? Not me.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: You must leave the car here.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: You thinking of scoring a Toyota?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: No problem – we leave the car.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Now what?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: C’mon. Be careful.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Be careful?! Where the fuck we going? Better
light?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: …June tenth… the evacuation of Leon… a woman
carries a pig… signs for the F.S.L.N. are everywhere… a body…</p>
<p><strong>an intersection held by la guardia troops with a
tanquetta</strong>: Price and Claire duck into a doorway, protected in
effect by the Government soldiers who wait silently, guns ready, around
the corner of a building. We see what they’re waiting for.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Russell?!</p>
<p><strong>sandinista #1</strong>: You must come and help us… one more
time.</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: No, please…</p>
<p><strong>sandinista #2</strong>: For Leon… for Nicaragua!</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: Americans? Journalists?</p>
<p><strong>claire and price</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: Ah! I put my autograph on this ball.</p>
<p><strong>sandinista #1</strong>: Pedro! There is no time to waste.</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: When you get back to the United States, I
want you to give this ball to Tippy Martinez for me. He is from
Nicaragua.</p>
<p><strong>sandinista #1</strong>: Enrique is dead! Roberto has
disappeared! The Guardia has the church, and we need you!</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: You come, eh? Can they come with us?</p>
<p><strong>sandinista #2</strong>: Come! Everybody come!</p>
<p><strong>p.o.v. the central plaza of leon dominated by a huge
cathedral</strong>: Half a dozen bodies are scattered across the plaza.
Otherwise, it is empty.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: No, please… it’s not safe. You must come
with me.</p>
<p><strong>three sandinistas, pedro, and price emerge from a
tunnel</strong>: onto a lower level of the cathedral rooftop where a
body lies. They are exposed immediately and automatic weapons fire opens
up on them – the Sandinistas flatten against a wall, quickly becoming
separated from Price and Pedro.</p>
<p><strong>two guardia move into position to flush out the
sandinistas</strong>: as they hide behind the cupolas. The hidden Third
Guerrilla opens fire killing a Guardia soldier, and the other soldier
races for the belltower. As he does:</p>
<p><strong>red cross man</strong>: Hay heridas o muertes aqui? Hay
heridas o muertes aqui?</p>
<p><strong>red cross man</strong>: Hay heridas o muertes aqui?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Price. You motherfucker, Price, I’m talking
to you.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Where are those bastards… are they away?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: They’re away.</p>
<p><strong>oates</strong>: What the fuck are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: What the fuck are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>oates</strong>: Awright, awright – you’re lookin’ good… how
ya like Nicaragua?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: It’s beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>oates</strong>: Shitload o’ greasers though, eh?</p>
<p><strong>sandinista #1</strong>: It’s getting late – come on.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: You’re okay?</p>
<p><strong>sandinista #1</strong>: San-dee Koufax, no?</p>
<p><strong>sandinista #2</strong>: Si, Koufax.</p>
<p><strong>sandinista #3</strong>: Es mejor que Koufax, eh?!</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Much better than Koufax.</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: Koufax is okay… but Tippy Martinez, he is the
best… he pitches for the Baltimore Orioles, and some day I will be the
second man from Nicaragua to play in the major leagues…</p>
<p><strong>sandinista #1</strong>: Tippy Martinez had a good fastball,
but Pedro has a curveball and a screwball that are better.</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: You will give my autographed baseball to
Tippy and tell him in five years I will be pitching with him, okay? He
better watch out for me, eh?</p>
<p><strong>sandinista #1</strong>: It’s too dangerous to return to
Managua at night. You should stay at the house of hammocks.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Gracias. Can they get into trouble for
keeping us?</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: No, no… you are not combatants. The Baltimore
team is my team…</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: You bastard!</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: What about him?!</p>
<p><strong>sandinista #1</strong>: He’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>sandinista #1</strong>: I will talk to Pedro’s mother. You
must go to the house of the hammocks if you want to be safe.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Hello sweetheart, this is your mother. I’m
in Leon and I miss you. Don’t worry about me – it’s not dangerous at
all. I guess you can’t believe what you hear on the news. I’ll put this
this tape in the mail when I get back to Managua, but knowing what the
mail service is like, I may be home before it arrives. I think about you
all the time and hope I can make it back before you graduate from
Jr. High.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I love you and I’ll finish this letter when
I get back to the hotel.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: I know who shot Pedro. I knew somebody was in
the tower.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Why didn’t you tell the guerrillas?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: I don’t know… then they would’ve killed him I
guess. I didn’t want to interfere.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: It wasn’t an easy choice.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: I think I made the wrong one.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: You didn’t take any pictures when it was
over.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: I didn’t? I picked up a gun. Jesus. Is
something happening to us?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Are you asleep?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: G’morning.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: You look beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: How long have you been doing this?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: ’Bout ten frames. Wait’ll you see the
pictures – you look great.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I’ll bet I look great – give me the
film.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: After they’re printed.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I’ll develop them myself – give it to me or
I’ll start taping what you say in your sleep.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: I talk in my sleep?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Girl’s names and F-stops. Terrible.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Call the office. I don’t want to go to work
today.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: How was Matagalpa?</p>
<p><strong>mini-cam crew #1</strong>: No bang-bang, Alex… none at
all.</p>

<p><strong>mini-cam crew #2</strong>: Half the press corps.</p>
<p><strong>close up</strong>: A PICTURE OF CLAIRE SLEEPING IN LEON It’s
all over and he knows it. He stares at, even admires, the image. He puts
it down and turns to leave as:</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Oh. How was Leon?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Bloody.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Yeah… I’ll bet… Claire…</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I’m tired of Nicaragua.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: You haven’t been here very long.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Long enough, lets face it, you were right…
everybody was right.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: My cheekbones. What do you think of ’em?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I like your cheekbones. Alex, are you all
right?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: This is a face made for television.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: You decided to go with the network.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Is he a good fuck?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Alex…</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: That’s a reasonable question for a reporter to
ask, isn’t it?! I shoulda never come down here, eh? This is the way it’s
going to be. I’ll make a shitload of money in television for just
sitting there. I’m gonna show up to work at Rockefeller Center every
morning and they’re gonna hand me the news with my coffee and toast. I
shoulda never come down here, eh? This war down here belongs to you
guys, okay? I’m on tommorrow’s plane.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Alex…</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: You want to take me to the airport? It’s okay.
I shoulda never come down here.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Take this to check in. I’ll be right
there.</p>

<p><strong>somoza, two wealthy businessmen, miss panama in a
floppy</strong>: HAT. Elsewhere mingling are: JAZY, ISELA, PRICE, REGIS.
An elaborate array of food sits on the table.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: You’re late to your own luncheon,
Mr. President – we can schedule this for another time.</p>
<p><strong>somoza</strong>: Nonsense – let them wait. We are a stunning
couple, eh? My stomach is very flat – I’ve been working out.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: We are a stunning couple. Mr. President, you
own one fifth of all the land in Nicaragua, you own the shipping port,
the national airlines, the Mercedes dealership…</p>
<p><strong>somoza</strong>: I am on a salt free diet…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Do you always hold hands with reporters?</p>
<p><strong>somoza</strong>: This is my mother and father. They were very
special to me. Every Sunday morning I drive out to the cemetery and put
flowers on their grave. I think people should know that.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Would you care to comment on the fall of
Leon to the rebels?</p>
<p><strong>hub</strong>: Listen, Russell, let’s grow up. It’s very easy
to fall in love with the underdog, eh? But there’s an upside and
downside to this thing – just wanta remind you… this stuff about a
“Revolution of Poets” is crap.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: But it’s great P.R. So what’s the upside?</p>
<p><strong>hub</strong>: Simple. And it could happen. Somoza destroys
the terrorist insurgents, rebuilds the country, shitcans the purveyors
of excess, stabilizes the cordoba, and is finally beloved as the savior
of Nicaragua. Our pal. Got a smoke?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: What’s the downside?</p>
<p><strong>hub</strong>: The Commies take over the world.</p>
<p><strong>hub</strong>: Excuse me, gentlemen, but the war may be
over.</p>
<p><strong>somoza</strong>: My people love me. My stomach is flat. Did I
say that already? No matter. It is flat.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: There are reports that the Guardia operates
a torture chamber at Coyotepe.</p>
<p><strong>somoza</strong>: I like this song.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Since the earthquake in 1972 destroyed half
of Managua, over three hundred million dollars in foreign relief aid
have poured into the country, yet nothing has been re-built. It is said
that the money has gone into your pocket.</p>
<p><strong>somoza</strong>: I love the press, I really do. Some of my
best friends are journalists.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Brazil, and Panama
are reportedly on the verge of breaking off diplomatic relations with
your regime. Would you comment?</p>
<p><strong>somoza</strong>: I am busy! Get out of here at once or I’ll
put my foot up your ass!</p>
<p><strong>somoza</strong>: I’m sorry to have to conclude this most
pleasant encounter, but something has happened.</p>
<p><strong>hub</strong>: Did he tell you about his parents in the
graveyard, the flowers and all that? Good, good…</p>
<p><strong>somoza</strong>: My friends… this gathering was not intended
to be a press conference as much as a… “get-together”… but I have just
been handed a piece of news.</p>
<p><strong>somoza</strong>: Rafael is dead. He has been killed in an
ambush in the Cordillera mountains of the Jinotega district.</p>
<p><strong>journalists</strong>: Mr. President! Mr. President!</p>
<p><strong>somoza</strong>: Please my friends – no questions. A press
release is being prepared.</p>
<p><strong>other journalist</strong>: They got Rafael? You believe
that?</p>
<p><strong>regis</strong>: Every six months Tacho gives this speech –
maybe they finally lucked out.</p>
<p><strong>jazy</strong>: Russell, excuse me… but I’ve just been put in
a rather embarrassing position. Mrs. Somoza would like her picture taken
with Miss Panama. In color?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: How the hell could Tacho find Rafael.</p>
<p><strong>jazy</strong>: Russell, please… I have my hands full…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. somoza</strong>: Tacho, Tacho… venga, por favor!</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Is Tacho lying again? They did kill him,
didn’t they?</p>
<p><strong>jazy</strong>: Everybody smile.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: One more, please! Una mas, por favor?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: We help each other, right? Could you move
your girlfriend into the sun…</p>
<p><strong>jazy</strong>: What do you need?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Is Rafael alive or dead?</p>
<p><strong>jazy</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Just one more – thank you. I thought you knew
everything?</p>
<p><strong>jazy</strong>: What do I know, eh? Tacho needs a victory very
badly… he needs to prove to Jimmy Carter that he is still winning. He
thinks Rafael’s death is the proof he needs.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Carter don’t need proof. He just sent
twenty-five million in new arms to Tacho. I’m sorry… almost got it
here.</p>
<p><strong>jazy</strong>: No, no… the arms shipment has been delayed in
New Orleans because Jimmy is getting nervous.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: The State Department’s gonna pull the plug on
Tacho?! Pardon my French – but whose fucking side are you on?</p>
<p><strong>jazy</strong>: …I work for everybody. If there is a
transition of power, I facilitate a relationship with the new people. If
there is not, I facilitate the status quo. Either way, I facilitate.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Great job.</p>
<p><strong>jazy</strong>: I send messages to Jimmy and I tell him that
the Revolution is a flood that cannot be stopped but it can be
controlled… nobody listens… I can’t even get a little water in my
pool.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Rough ain’t it. Thank you everybody, very
nice.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: I don’t think Rafael is dead. I’m gonna find
him.</p>
<p><strong>jazy</strong>: They say he’s very handsome. It would make a
wonderful picture, eh?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Con permiso – who controls what today?</p>
<p><strong>red cross worker</strong>: The Sandinistas hold the hills,
the Guardia has everything else.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: How do we find the guerillas?</p>
<p><strong>red cross worker</strong>: Va alli, dos o tres cuartos, doble
la esquina al francotirador.</p>
<p><strong>regis</strong>: What’d he say?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Go two or three blocks and turn right at the
sniper.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: You can drop us off.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Wrong way!</p>
<p><strong>regis</strong>: We’re not looking for the guerillas.</p>

climb</strong>: OUT, so they climb back in quickly.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Lo siento!</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Go one more block.</p>

<p><strong>a thunderous roar – the tank destroys the camera

<p><strong>the tank swings its turret toward the house and opens
fire</strong>: and the wall of the house crumbles quickly as a family
scrambles to the rooftop of a neighboring house. Their house is

<p><strong>claire</strong>: Si.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Venga.</p>
<p><strong>isela</strong>: You are looking for Rafael?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Yeah. If it’s possible.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Do you know why we’re here… exactly?</p>
<p><strong>isela</strong>: Mr. Price doesn’t do anything before
announcing it first in the bar. It’s a good story. You’ll be more
famous.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Rafael’s tent?</p>
<p><strong>isela</strong>: Venga, companeros.</p>

scenes,</strong>: AND COMMANDANTE CINCO, dressed in camouflaged
khaki.</p>
<p><strong>isela</strong>: This is Commandante Cinco.</p>
<p><strong>isela</strong>: Today we took Matagalpa. Leon is about to
fall, and Masaya. And next week we could be in Managua but it is still
possible to lose. In the last days of our final offensive the people of
Nicaragua must know that Rafael is alive and well.</p>
<p><strong>commandante cinco</strong>: Queremos un fotografia.</p>
<p><strong>isela</strong>: We need a photograph. Come with us.</p>
<p><strong>commandante cinco</strong>: Usted es un fotografo magnifico.
Queremos que vive.</p>
<p><strong>isela</strong>: Why is he laughing?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: You’re crazy.</p>
<p><strong>cinco</strong>: We have momentum, but many more lives will be
lost. Even Washington is starting to admit that the butcher Somoza is
not loved by his people. They have detained twenty-five million dollars
in new arms shipments for Somoza at an airfield in Florida until they
find out if Rafael is alive or dead. We know about these things.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: If Washington thinks Rafael is dead, they
will ship the arms to Somoza. Do you understand.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Yeah. Commandante… Soy un periodista.</p>
<p><strong>cinco</strong>: This has nothing to do with journalism –
there is more to the world than journalism. We are going to end this war
with you or without you. People don’t really believe in Rafael – they
believe in the idea of Rafael, no? Because for now the idea of Rafael is
enough for the people of Nicaragua. When the war is over – none of this
matters.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: I don’t do things… like this.</p>
<p><strong>cinco</strong>: Enough lives have been lost already. It’s
difficult, I know – but you must do it.</p>
<p><strong>cinco</strong>: In the morning, eh? When there’s better
light!</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I spend my whole life separating how I feel
from how I think and what I see from what I say – that’s called
journalism, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: It’s disciplined. It civilized. It involves
distinctions. I’m great at distinctions. I wish I wasn’t so good at
them. Sometimes I envy you – you don’t make any – it’s very convenient.
The only time I don’t worry about all those things is when I’m with my
daughter.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Or when you’re in bed.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Yes! My job is to find a story, then tell a
story – whatever it is – because I believe that if enough people hear
enough stories then somehow, through information alone, we all have a
better chance to survive. I believe in information. That’s a very
romantic streak I have running through me – maybe it’s a weakness.
Information is good – lack of information is bad. Simple, eh?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Not so simple.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: You’re God damn right it’s not. You take
that picture you’ll take it for all the right reasons – I
understand.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: I’m not gonna take it.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: That’s fine for you. But do I go back and
say I interviewed Rafael? Do I go back and say I missed the biggest
story of the war? Or do I say Rafael was stone cold dead – that’s the
information, isn’t it? Or do I say he entertained us all in his
inimitably charismatic manner around the ol’ revolutionary campfire? Can
we throw up our arms and say we fell in love with the querillas because
their cause was… sympathetic? Journalists don’t fall in love. Which
story do you want me to tell?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Do what you want to do.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Christ, what the fuck are we doing here?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: I want to be here. With you. What do you
want.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I want this war to end. I’m not going to
tell the world that Rafael is dead.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I think I love you.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Don’t think so much.</p>
<p><strong>price’s p.o.v. of a tableau of rafael, cinco, and
soldiers</strong>: They sit at a table studying a map, a copy of La
Prensa is displayed – the headlines declare that RAFAEL IS DEAD and
featuring a photo of Somoza at the luncheon as he points to a map of the
country. For an instant Rafael looks alive –</p>
<p><strong>miss panama</strong>: Marcel!</p>
<p><strong>regis</strong>: We got the smoke in frame?</p>
<p><strong>crewmember</strong>: We got the smoke.</p>
<p><strong>regis</strong>: Roll it…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Under a steel gray July sky… start again…
under a gray steel Managuan sky… scratch it… In an extraordinary
development in Managua, President Anastazio Somoza has ordered the Air
Force to begin bombing his own capitol, under a sky… fuck it…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Oh my God…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: A Scotch, please… Double.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: What’s he doing here?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I have no idea.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: On what?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: On what?! The Washington Post, the Times,
networks, wire services – everybody’s picked up the picture. It’s
fabulous.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Well, yes… it’s fabulous.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Fabulous.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Why are you back?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I came back because of Russell.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Because of me?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Yeah… the whole fucking East Coast is falling
in love with Rafael – they were sure he was dead this time. Somebody
wants to do a musical about him and his mug’s on every T-shirt in
Central Park.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I think he’s bigger than Farrah Fawcett.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: You look good. Things’re okay?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I’m happier in New York, sure, things are
great. You guys?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Terrific… now… I’m a little slow here, Alex…
what exactly did you come back for?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: It’s a great story. I want to talk to Rafael…
and you’re the only man in the world that can take me to him.</p>
<p><strong>hub</strong>: Alex! Couldn’t stay away, eh?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: We’ve got to tell Alex what happened.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: No way.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I’ll tell him. He deserves to know.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: We don’t owe him anything!</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: We owe him that! He got you started in this
business… he covered for your missed deadlines and made excuses for your
unprofessional attitude before the world fell in love with your
pictures… Before kids fresh out of journalism school were rushing off to
any war they could to interview bullets and take pictures of bodies –
like Price! He took care of you before you were hot!</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: He wouldn’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Before Nicaragua you wouldn’t understand.
I’m not sure I exactly understand. What are we going to do?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: I’ll take Alex to find Rafael – we’ll go to
Sebaco on the road to Matagalpa – the Guardia heavily control the area
and they’re scared right now – they’ll never let us through. We won’t be
able to get near Rafael. Alex will understand – and we’ll turn around
and drive back without a story.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: That’s a lie!</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Tell me about lies!</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I don’t want to tell him either.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: We may not be able to find him, y’know…</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I’ve got supreme confidence in you.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Claire looks good, eh?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Everybody looks good in the tropics.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Since I haven’t been able to find Isela since
coming back, you’re going to have to translate for me – what the hell
does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Alex… I love her.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: And she ‘thinks’ she loves you.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: It’s past the thinking stage.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I’d like to know something – it probably
doesn’t matter in the great final scheme of things… but I’m interested…
Did you ever lay a hand on her before she left me?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: That’s the truth?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Yes! Alex – we’re friends!</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Venga.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I bet you go through a few rental cars.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Don’t worry. I put this in your name.</p>
<p><strong>price hurries through the shacks toward the execution
wall</strong>: as Alex calls to him and hurries after – Price is single-
minded. As he moves through the shacks we hear another volley of fire,
and Price bursts into a clearing to see:</p>
<p><strong>oates</strong>: No pictures, eh? Might look bad.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: You get paid by the body or by the hour?</p>
<p><strong>oates</strong>: I get paid the same way you do. What the fuck
you doin’ in Sebaco – this place’s about to blow… ain’t it?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: You didn’t have to nail Pedro.</p>
<p><strong>oates</strong>: Who’s Pedro?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Oh my God…</p>
<p><strong>oates</strong>: There’s a motherfucking war goin’ on, pal…
lotta sad stories.</p>
<p><strong>the bodies of the priest from leon and the
businessman,</strong>: figures we saw at Rafael’s camp, sit in the back
of the truck. They are splattered with blood and lifeless. Price is
shaken.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Why them? Why them?!</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: You’re a cocksucker!</p>
<p><strong>oates</strong>: I don’t suck no dick, man…</p>
<p><strong>oates</strong>: I’d prefer not splattering your brains in a
dump like this – I got priorities. Guy wants to be a hero, pops, get him
outta here before he’s a number. Be a shitty little town to buy it in.
Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Russell, let’s get outta here.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>oates</strong>: Guy’s got a sense of humor, old man. Got any
dope? Tough place to find decent dope?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Why them?</p>
<p><strong>oates</strong>: Them? C’mere. You too.</p>
<p><strong>oates</strong>: If your mug shows up in this box… and ya try
to make it through Sebaco… I owe yer ass.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Who gives you the pictures?</p>
<p><strong>oates</strong>: What’s this, an interview? I ain’t that
dumb.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Off the record.</p>
<p><strong>oates</strong>: Off the record… some pachuco gives ’em to me.
Ain’t none of my business, but I heard he gets ’em from a Frog.</p>
<p><strong>oates</strong>: Nice, eh?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: She dead?</p>
<p><strong>oates</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>oates</strong>: Whatya’ expect? We’re the ones gettin’ our
butts kicked.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Some-motherfucker-took-my-fucking-
pictures-I-don’t-fucking-know-what- happened! Fuck me!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Didn’t you ship the film to New York?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: I developed it in my room. Jesus Christ,
Alex?!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Slow down. It wasn’t your fault if somebody
stole your stuff…</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: It was.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: What about Rafael?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Algo no esta aqui. Fotografias.</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: Everything’s always a mess here. You should be
neater.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Negativos, negativos!</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Commandante Cinco’s body was just found on
the road to Matagalpa.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I don’t think it’s Jazy.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Oates said it was a Frog. How many Frenchmen
you know around here? Jazy ain’t ‘facilitating’ shit.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Christ!</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Are we looking for negs or prints?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Anything.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Que quiere?</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Donde esta senor Jazy?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: No esta aqui.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Que quienes?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Una novia suya.</p>
<p><strong>soldier #2</strong>: El hombre tiene muchas novias, eh?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: No, no, no…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Russell? Russell?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Let’s get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>miss panama</strong>: Hola.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: We’ve got to talk to Alex.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: You think our flags are big enough?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: This is what I want to show you.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: We drove through three roadblocks a half hour
before curfew so you could show me a statue of Tacho.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: It’s not Tacho. It’s Mussolini. Tacho went to
Italy to commission a statue of himself, he found a warehouse full of Il
Duces on horseback, got a great deal on one of ’em – brought it back and
switched heads. Ya can’t tell, can ya?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: What the hell are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I think what he’s trying to say – what we’re
trying to say – is that things aren’t exactly what they seem to be.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Well, they don’t “seem” to be that great so I
can’t wait for this one… Hey, here we are! Two guys in the tropics in
love with the same dame… bullets flying!</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Alex! That’s not why we’re here.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Oh yeah? I left the country because of him…
…and I came back because of him… And now the cutest couple in town has
me looking up a horse’s ass on a midnight tour of Managua. What are we
doing here?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Rafael is dead.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: In the picture he’s dead?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Dead!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: How the hell…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Who cares how?!</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Alex… I think I finally saw one too many
bodies. Somoza is a killer. I thought the war would end sooner. How many
reasons do you want?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: You saw too many bodies? That’s a lot of
bodies. You stupid son of a bitch. Did he talk you into it?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: No! I wanted Rafael to be alive.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: In some way I understand him doing it, I don’t
like it but I understand… but you?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I’d do it again.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: You two have, of course, just served me up
your balls – if that’s what they’re called – on a platter. I can bury
you both. You’re handing me your careers.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Well, Jesus Christ… this is a motherfucking
story, Russell… What am I supposed to do with it?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Anything you want.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: They’re holding the lead in the World section
for Rafael.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: It’s great stuff, isn’t it? We’d go down in a
blaze of glory.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Oh yeah… I don’t know what to do. I’ve gotta
take some kind of a story back with me. Maybe Jazy, eh?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Oh Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: It’s a little dangerous looking for Jazy at
the moment.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Ah, danger – I love it. You could ask the
pointy-shoed little bastard about your pictures… and I could ask him
whatever happened to Isela.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: She’s an officer in the Rafael army – we saw
her in Matagalpa.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: You mean I slept with a Sandinista?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I guess Rafael is alive, eh?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Damn air conditioning.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I wish I was home.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: C’mere.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Do you think it’s almost over?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Alex… let’s go back.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Jazy’s probably sitting in the bar laughing at
us. Which way’s the hotel?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I’ll ask her… be right back.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Just a sec’… take a flag.</p>
<p><strong>through camera p.o.v. alex is shot in the chest from
point</strong>: BLANK RANGE – FREEZE FRAMES click, click, whirring as
the images blur and the camera is dropped.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: You fucks! You fucks!</p>
<p><strong>guardia soldier</strong>: Fotografia!</p>
<p><strong>somoza</strong>: It is with grave concern that we announce
that Alexander Grazier, senior American correspondent, has been murdered
at the hands of terrorists…</p>
<p><strong>somoza</strong>: Mr. Kittle has prepared statements for
you.</p>
<p><strong>claire keeps working and gradually types less as she
hears</strong>: the story, finally rising and moving in front of the
television as a local newsman reads of Alex’s death and we see the
Somoza press announcement.</p>
<p><strong>regis</strong>: Get my bill and get me a cab, hey, amigo!</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: No cabs.</p>
<p><strong>regis</strong>: Cabs!</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: No cabs!</p>
<p><strong>claire gets off the elevator and moves through this
chaos</strong>: Regis sees her and tries to give her comfort – she’s
beyond that. She wears a jacket and carries her bag – she’s going
somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>regis</strong>: I’m sorry, Claire…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Heard from Russell?</p>
<p><strong>regis</strong>: Nobody has.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Wanta help me find him?</p>
<p><strong>regis</strong>: Claire… it’s on the weird side out there…</p>
<p><strong>hub</strong>: Jesus Christ, Claire, a human tragedy, what can
I say?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Fuck off, Hub, get outta my way.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Do you know where the American journalist
was killed?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Have you seen him?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: This is the best I can offer.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Gracias.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Venga aqui.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Nobody is here. Get out.</p>
<p><strong>the door is kicked open, and a soldier steps into the
room</strong>: For a moment he doesn’t see Price – then he whirls and
faces the photographer who’s so scared he’s forgotten to raise his
gun.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Esta alli?!</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Esta alli?!</p>
<p><strong>boy soldier</strong>: No esta aqui.</p>
<p><strong>guardia officer</strong>: We are you! We are you! What are
you doing?!</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Russell!</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: What’re you doing here?!</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Alex!</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: The Guardia did it – I got pictures.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Hola. Do you control this area?</p>
<p><strong>disco sandinista</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>muchacho #1</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>jazy</strong>: They are my friends.</p>
<p><strong>muchacho #2</strong>: Shut up. We kill them all.</p>
<p><strong>muchacho #3</strong>: No. Only him.</p>
<p><strong>muchacho #1</strong>: Him or him or her?</p>
<p><strong>jazy</strong>: Well, here we are, eh?</p>
<p><strong>muchacho #1</strong>: Assassin! Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>jazy</strong>: The boys are confused – they think I had their
family killed.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: You murder people.</p>
<p><strong>jazy</strong>: “Murder” is a word for criminals. I have a job
to protect the stability of a continent.</p>
<p><strong>muchacho #3</strong>: Pig! Hijo de puta!</p>
<p><strong>jazy</strong>: Please…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: You got caught by some boys?</p>
<p><strong>jazy</strong>: Yes. Poets too, I imagine. Is your recorder
on?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>jazy</strong>: Good. I have a speech to make.</p>
<p><strong>jazy</strong>: I like you people, but you are sentimental
shits. You fall in love with the poets, the poets fall in love with the
Marxists, the Marxists fall in love with themselves. The country is
destroyed with rhetoric, and in the end we are stuck with tyrants.</p>
<p><strong>muchacho #1</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>jazy</strong>: Un minuto, por favor.</p>
<p><strong>muchacho #2</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>jazy</strong>: They are journalists.</p>
<p><strong>muchacho #1</strong>: Periodistas! Take this picture! I’m
going to blow his head off.</p>
<p><strong>jazy</strong>: Somoza? He is a tyrant too, of course. A
butcher. But finally that is not the point, you see. If we wish to
survive – we have a choice of tyrants, and for all the right reasons,
your poets choose the wrong side.</p>
<p><strong>muchacho #1</strong>: Fotografia!</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jazy</strong>: Yes. Your picture of Rafael was brilliant… but
I am alive, and better looking. A good looking Frenchman with a
sympathetic face is murdered in cold blood while fighting for the
survival of Europe and America. You will have another magazine cover!
Muy complicado, no?</p>
<p><strong>muchacho #1</strong>: Ready! Now!</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: You picked the wrong side.</p>
<p><strong>jazy</strong>: In fifty years we will know who’s right. Are
you going to take the picture as the bullet enters the skull or as it
comes out? This wall’s a nice color, eh? I can move into the
sunlight.</p>
<p><strong>jazy</strong>: It’s just a story!</p>
<p><strong>muchacho #1</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>jazy</strong>: They say that if somebody’s holding a gun on
you, you should never stop talking… that’s the theory – who knows?…</p>
<p><strong>jazy</strong>: Maybe it’s a good thing that I talk too
much…</p>
<p><strong>p.o.v. several guerrillas retreating from an
advancing</strong>: TANQUETTA a block away. The neighborhood seems to be
changing hands again.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: You okay? Russell… what did Alex do?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Nothing. He asked for directions.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: We gotta get outta sight – half the fucking
army’s looking for me…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: They’re not looking for me.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Let me have the film… …if I can’t get to the
hotel I’ll come back here…</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Aw, Christ… I’ve wrecked everything else, at
least let me take care of you here.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Russell… it’s more dangerous being with you
than being alone.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Don’t get hurt.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: That’s great advice.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Journalist? You knew the man who was killed?
Fifty thousand Nicaraguans have died… and now one Yankee. Perhaps now
Americans will be outraged at what is happening here, eh?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Yes… perhaps they will.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Maybe we should have killed an American
journalist fifty years ago.</p>
<p><strong>p.o.v. – a helicopter with searchlight passes
overhead,</strong>: momentarily illuminating the hospital, but it
continues on, curiously uninterested in the Guerrilla activity. The
chopper sweeps above a nearby hill and hovers, then slowly lowers to
earth.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Have you seen La Guardia?</p>
<p><strong>woman with children</strong>: No. Is the war over?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>child</strong>: Tanquettas! Tanquettas!</p>
<p><strong>woman with children</strong>: Is the war over?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>woman with children</strong>: Es bueno.</p>
<p><strong>claire walks into her own room – price stands at the
balcony</strong>: looking out at the jubilant city from which smoke
still rises.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Alex.</p>
<p><strong>voice of hub kittle</strong>: It was the best I would do
under the circumstances. The casket, I mean.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Can you help us ship it home?</p>
<p><strong>hub</strong>: I’ve already taken care of it. I always liked
the guy. I can’t even get tickets for my own family, but I could get you
two on the plane if you want.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Yes, please…</p>
<p><strong>hub</strong>: Tacho’s in Miami.</p>
<p><strong>hub’s daughter</strong>: Daddy!</p>
<p><strong>hub</strong>: I am sorry. I had a job to do – that’s all – it
put me in some unhappy situations.</p>
<p><strong>oates</strong>: Hey, Pricey…</p>
<p><strong>oates</strong>: It’s all over, eh? We made it. I like the
singing.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: What’re you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>oates</strong>: Free country. Now it’s free, anyway.
Nicalibre!</p>
<p><strong>oates</strong>: How ’bout a quickie? No? Things are heating
up in Thailand… thought I’d check it out. You ain’t gonna turn me in,
are ya?</p>
<p><strong>oates</strong>: Am I gonna see ya in Thailand? We could be
friends!</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: We’ve got a plane to catch.</p>
