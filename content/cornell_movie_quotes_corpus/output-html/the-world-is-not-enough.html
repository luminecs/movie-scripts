<h1 id="the-world-is-not-enough">the-world-is-not-enough</h1>
<p><strong>lachaise</strong>: Not the usual Swiss procedure, Mr. Bond,
but you understand, a man in my position..</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Which is neutral, no doubt.</p>
<p><strong>lachaise</strong>: It wasn’t easy, but I retrieved the money.
No doubt Sir Robert will be pleased to see it again.</p>
<p><strong>lachaise</strong>: In the current exchange rate, minus the
fees, of course, and certain unforeseeable expenses. Here is the
receipt…</p>
<p><strong>cigar girl</strong>: Would you like to check my figures?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Perhaps later.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: My glasses.</p>
<p><strong>lachaise</strong>: It’s all there.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: I didn’t come for the money. The report you
sold him was stolen from an MI-6 agent, who was killed for it.</p>
<p><strong>lachaise</strong>: I did not get the report from an MI-6
agent.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Who did you get it from?</p>
<p><strong>lachaise</strong>: I am just a middle man. I am doing the
honourable thing and returning the money to its rightful owner…</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: And we know how difficult that can be for the
Swiss.</p>
<p><strong>lachaise</strong>: Your last chance. Take the money.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Your last chance. Give me the name.</p>
<p><strong>lachaise</strong>: Stripped of all your weaponry, you still
threaten me?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Perhaps you failed to take into account
my…hidden assets.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: The name?</p>
<p><strong>lachaise</strong>: I can’t tell you… Alright, alright! But
you must protect me!</p>
<p><strong>renard</strong>: What’s his name? Our friend from MI-6?</p>
<p><strong>cigar girl</strong>: James Bond.</p>
<p><strong>renard</strong>: One of M’s more accomplished tin
soldiers.</p>
<p><strong>cigar girl</strong>: He could identify me.</p>
<p><strong>renard</strong>: If it concerns you…kill him.</p>
<p><strong>renard</strong>: Let’s toast this James Bond. We’re in his
hands now…</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Have this checked, see what you can get off
it.</p>
<p><strong>moneypenny</strong>: James. Brought me a souvenir from
Geneva?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Thought you might want one of these.</p>
<p><strong>moneypenny</strong>: I gave up a long time ago. She’s in with
Sir Robert.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Sir Robert King, James Bond.</p>
<p><strong>sir robert</strong>: Thanks for getting my money back –never
expected to see it again. You’re the kind of man I could use. Though I
won’t offend certain parties by asking you to join King Industries.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Construction’s not exactly my line.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Quite the opposite, in fact.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Old friend?</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Since Oxford. I knew him when he had nothing but
a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world. He’s a man of
great integrity.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Who buys classified reports for three million
pounds.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: It’s a report on weapons security in the former
Soviet Union, which, as you know, is shaky at best. He’s had several
instances of sabotage at the pipeline, and he’s understandably
concerned. He called me the moment he realized its sensitive nature.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Someone was watching over me in Geneva. A
guardian angel with a laser sight.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: King.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Moneypenny, stop King leaving.</p>
<p><strong>moneypenny</strong>: Security –</p>
<p><strong>q</strong>: ..the hydro boat can operate in three inches of
water…</p>
<p><strong>sir robert</strong>: Thanks, but I’ll count it myself.
Lifetime habit. I’m Scottish.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Stop! King!</p>
<p><strong>q</strong>: It’s not finished!</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Bond, we’ll meet you inside.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Beautiful, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Today, of all days, the sun decides to
shine.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Perhaps Sir Robert had a word with the Man
Upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: A word? I’m sure by now he’s engineered a
hostile takeover.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: You knew him well?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: He was my father.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: He died before he could complete his lifelong
dream. I intend to finish it for him.</p>
<p><strong>older man</strong>: Elektra!</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Elektra? Running King Industries? I’ve known that
girl all her life. I’m not sure she knows what she’s walking into.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: She’s not a girl anymore.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: I’ve scheduled a medical for you.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: It’s barely a scratch. The Dome broke my
fall.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Well, at least it turned out to have some
purpose.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: No-one goes into the field on this unless they’re
100%. Dr. Greatrex is waiting.</p>
<p><strong>doctor greatrex</strong>: Dislocated collar bone. If any more
tendons snap… It won’t just be two weeks out of action.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: I need you to pass me fit now, Molly.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: It’s just a scratch.</p>
<p><strong>doctor greatrex</strong>: James. It wouldn’t really be…</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Ethical? Can’t we just skirt the issue?</p>
<p><strong>doctor greatrex</strong>: …if you showed
sufficient…willpower. Promised to slow down. Cut out running,
jumping…shooting. All kinds of…</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Strenuous activity?</p>
<p><strong>doctor greatrex</strong>: Then maybe I’d be… open to
that.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Perhaps after this … test?</p>
<p><strong>doctor greatrex</strong>: …yes?…</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: I could come for a second opinion?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: …The money was dipped in urea, dried, and
packed tight. In one note the metal strip had been replaced with a
combustible magnesium circuit – in effect a tiny detonator. King always
wore a pin in his lapel, an heirloom called ‘the Eye of the Glens’; but
someone switched it for a copy, a ceramic micro- circuit emitting an
electronic signature.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: When he came within range of the money –
boom. Ingenious.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: We’ve been pawns in someone’s game. They tricked
us into bringing the money to King. Not just elaborate. Cock-sure.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: And expensive. Cost three million plus.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Cheap, if it achieves your aim of de- stabilizing
the Western World.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: 007. What do you know of the Caspian Sea?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Caviar capital of the world. Matchless beluga.
Firm, yet subtle. Largest landlocked body of water on Earth. Oil-rich.
Hitler wanted it. Stalin beat him to it.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: And now it’s up for grabs, a goldrush. Far more
oil than anyone thought.</p>
<p><strong>robinson</strong>: Latest estimates, six trillion dollars.
It’ll make the Gulf look like a puddle, see us right through the new
century. The problem is getting the oil out of there.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: There are four pipelines in the works. Three to
the Black Sea, shipping out through the Bosphorus. All vulnerable to
unstable governments or Russian blockade.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: So Sir Robert’s goes through Turkey, direct to
the Med…?</p>
<p><strong>robinson</strong>: A huge project. The most expensive of the
pipelines, but the one supported by every Western leader. None of the
American oil companies were willing to take it on. But King has
connections to the region. He married into the Vavra family, rich local
industrialists. He used those connections to hold it all together.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Kill the man, kill the pipeline.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Not necessarily. Not with Elektra taking
over.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Your call to the PM.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Our credibility has been hit hard. We have to hit
back harder. Your assignments.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: I’m waiting for the report on your medical.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: …somehow managed to shoot two of her
captors and escape…</p>
<p><strong>police video</strong>: Elektra interviewed; bruised,
emotional.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: … the leader, the one who escaped. Can you
describe him?</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: He shouted. He shouted all the time –</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Tell me about the kidnapping of Elektra
King.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Who told you to look at Elektra’s files?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: I took the initiative.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: You haven’t been given an assignment in this
case.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: I was the one who brought that money in…</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: I’m well aware of your stake in this, 007. If you
have a point, get to it.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: The amount of money that killed Robert King is
the same amount as the ransom demand for Elektra.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Whoever kidnapped Elektra is the same man who
killed her father.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: It’s a message. He wants us to know he’s
back.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Claude Serrault. A.K.A…</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Renard.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Sir Robert tried to deal with the kidnapping with
his own…resources, at first. When Elektra’s ear was delivered to him in
the post, he came to me. I advised against paying the ransom. I knew it
was Renard. I played it out as long as possible to get a fix on him.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Sacrifice the girl to take out the
terrorist?</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: How many deaths is he responsible for? How many
innocent people? You may only get one shot at a man like Renard. Same
circumstances, I’d do the same again.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: We sent 009 down to kill him. Before he could,
Elektra escaped. A week later our man caught up with the target. Put a
bullet in his head. That bullet is still there.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: He survived?</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: The doctor who saved him couldn’t get it out, so
Renard killed him. When Interpol found the x-rays, there was mild
jubilation. Effectively, he’s a dead man.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: The bullet is moving through the medulla
oblongata, killing off his sense of touch. He feels no pain. He can push
himself harder, longer than any normal man.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: ‘That which does not kill me makes me
stronger.’</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: He’s not through yet. Renard doesn’t blow up
five million dollars unless he knows there’s more coming in. He’s
working for someone. Someone who wants to stop the pipeline. And they
hired the perfect killer. One with a vendetta against King…and you.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: I see the good doctor gave you glowing
testimonials. ‘Exceptional stamina’…</p>
<p><strong>moneypenny</strong>: He’s always been good at oral exams.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Get out to the pipeline. Find the insider who
switched the pin. If your instincts are right, Renard will be back. He
hasn’t completed the job. The pipeline is still going forward, and we
have Elektra to thank for that.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: The worm on the hook again.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Scottish heavy metal, Q?</p>
<p><strong>q</strong>: Oh pipe down, 007. Your 29th. Try not to lose
this one. It has dual lasers and a miniature grappling hook with fifty
feet of high-tensile micro-filament, able to support 800 pounds.</p>
<p><strong>q</strong>: New refinement. Sort of X-ray vision. For
checking concealed weapons.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: And other uses, no doubt.</p>
<p><strong>q</strong>: Abuses in your case. You destroyed my hydro-boat
in less than seven minutes, as no doubt will be the case with this…</p>
<p><strong>q</strong>: 007, my Deputy Assistant. I’m grooming him to
follow me.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: That would make you…“R”?</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: Ahh, the rampant 007 wit. I, of course, am
laughing inside. But I dare say you’ve met your match in this machine.
The absolute latest in intercepts, surveillance and countermeasures.
Titanium plating and armor, a multi- tasking heads-up display.
Completely indestructible. All in all, rather stocked.</p>
<p><strong>q</strong>: ‘Fully loaded’ I think is the term.</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: Do take good care of her.</p>
<p><strong>davidov</strong>: Bond. A government man. I’m afraid since
you English got the boss killed we’ve been a little…jumpy.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: I’d rather you didn’t play with that.</p>
<p><strong>davidov</strong>: Nice.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Quite stunning.</p>
<p><strong>davidov</strong>: Sorry about all that, comrade. Old habits
die hard. I am Head of Security. Davidov.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: …they should have been in place two days
ago. That is the target my father set.</p>
<p><strong>foreman</strong>: We’ve had some trouble with the villagers
at Ruan. Some sacred burial plot…</p>
<p><strong>davidov</strong>: Miss King…James Bond here to see you.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: Find me the research on the limestone
deposits, go ahead and place these orders, and get the jeep ready. I
will go to Ruan myself…</p>
<p><strong>davidov</strong>: Miss King, I wouldn’t recommend…</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: I said, I will go.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: Would you excuse us, Davidov?</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: I met you at my father’s funeral.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: I haven’t been able to recall a single
moment of that day…until now.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Funerals aren’t exactly memorable.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: God no. All those horrible loved ones and
relatives. I don’t want to talk to those people. I just want to…talk to
my father. I loved him. I’m not sure he knew that.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Is that why you want to finish the
pipeline?</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: Partially, yes.</p>
<p><strong>gabor</strong>: The jeep is ready, Ma’am. Will I be driving
with you?</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: No, Gabor. We have a guest.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Who is he?</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: My bodyguard. He follows me everywhere.
He’s decisive, vigilant. And he makes an excellent omelette.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: How long has he been with you?</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: Since the kidnapping. Why do you ask?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Does this look familiar to you?</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: It’s my father’s pin. He wore it everyday
of his life.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: Are you trying to break my heart? Or is it
just your way with women?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: It’s not the pin your father wore. It’s an
exact duplicate. Inside is a tiny electrical detonator. We have reason
to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice, someone who worked at
this company.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: If you’ve come here to look after me,
Mr. Bond, thank you, but no thank you. I have two bodyguards, I don’t
need a third…</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: The killer doesn’t want to see this pipeline
continue, doesn’t want to see you take over…</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: That’s every man within a five mile radius.
Including you. That’s why you’re here, isn’t it? You think I can’t do
it. You think I’m going to screw up. Or get myself killed.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: I think running this pipeline would be a
difficult job for anyone. Especially King’s daughter.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: You are wrong, Mr. Bond. In fact, I am the
only person who can do it.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: My mother’s people discovered oil here
ninety years ago. The Bolsheviks slaughtered them for it. Some say oil
is in my family’s blood. I say our blood is in the oil. This is the very
heart of the planet. Up here in the hills was Eden, literally. Look what
the Russians did to it. Now we have a second chance and this time we’ll
do it right. When the other wells have all dried up, she’ll still be
pumping her lifeblood to the world. And this Will be one of the main
arteries…</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: Send the pipe around.</p>
<p><strong>foreman</strong>: It will take weeks, cost millions. Your
father approved this route.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: Then my father was wrong.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: I have to check the upper lines. Gabor will
drive you back.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Always wanted to see the upper lines.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: You don’t take no for an answer, do
you?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: Alright then. Do you ski?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: I’ve been known to.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Can’t land. Wind’s too strong!</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: Just hold her steady. You wanted to see
it.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: We’re building from both ends. This is
where they’ll meet. Fifteen hundred miles from the Caspian to the
Mediterranean.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Head for that gully, I’ll lure them into the
trees!</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Should have stuck to snowboarding.</p>
<p><strong>paraski #2</strong>: both of them having set their course for
Bond, they are now on a collision course with EACH OTHER…</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: Are they gone? All of them?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Hold on to me.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: Oh my God…we’re buried alive…</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: We’re alright.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: I can’t stay here.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: You’re not going to.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: No! It will cave in!</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: It’s the only way out…</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: I can’t breathe, I can’t breathe…</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Elektra, look at me, look in my eyes!</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: She’s fine. Contusions. A slight strain to
her ankle, but otherwise, fine. She wants to see you.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: I can’t stay.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: I need to ask you something. And I need you
to tell me the truth.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: Who is it? Who is trying to kill me?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: I don’t know. But I will find him.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: After the kidnapping…I was afraid to go
outside, to be alone, to be in a crowd, to do anything at all, until I
realized… There’s no point in living if you can’t…feel alive.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: I can’t huddle in the shadows. I can’t let
fear run my life. I won’t.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: The way I acted, in the snow…you must think
I’m a coward.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: I think you’re one of the bravest people I’ve
ever met.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: …you should rest.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: James…</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: I have to go.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: Then take me with you.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: No. You’ll be safe here.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: I don’t want to be safe!</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: I have to go to work.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: Now who’s the coward?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Valentin Zukovsky.</p>
<p><strong>zukovsky</strong>: BondJamesBond. What brings you here?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: You, of course. I need some information.</p>
<p><strong>zukovsky</strong>: Bond, I’m a civilian. This is my place.
Used to be the royal family’s, now it’s mine. I run my little business,
I stay out of trouble…</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Mafia warlords, Diplomats and spies,
consortiums from every country in the world. A nice little rat’s
nest.</p>
<p><strong>zukovsky</strong>: Have some of the rat’s nest caviar. From
my own fishery. They buy my caviar, drink my champagne, lose to my
House.</p>
<p><strong>zukovsky</strong>: Let me introduce you to a former colleague
of mine at the KGB. Dmitri Palov, you may know him as…the Boa.</p>
<p><strong>boa</strong>: The great 007. For years I have dreamed of
closing my hands around your neck.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Boa. Have you had any therapy since
Perestroika?</p>
<p><strong>zukovsky</strong>: Why am I suddenly worried I’m not carrying
enough insurance?</p>
<p><strong>zukovsky</strong>: See? You’re upsetting my customers. What
do you want?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: How does a terrorist like Renard supply his
men with state-of-the-art Russian Army weapons?</p>
<p><strong>zukovsky</strong>: What? This is not possible.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: If I remember my Cyrillic that says 101st
airborne division.</p>
<p><strong>zukovsky</strong>: Where did you get this?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Off a high-powered Paraski that was trying to
kill me.</p>
<p><strong>zukovsky</strong>: The Russian Army, they spend millions on
flying skis, but they cannot afford to pay the soldiers. The men, they
do what they have to do to feed their families. In this country, for the
right price and a pack of cigarettes, you can get anything you want.</p>
<p><strong>zukovsky</strong>: That too. Everyone does what they can to
survive.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: How high up does this…arms dealing go?</p>
<p><strong>zukovsky</strong>: Bond. If someone wants you dead, it is
Renard. Our government has nothing to gain by killing you.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: But you would have something to gain by
killing Robert King. And stopping his pipeline.</p>
<p><strong>zukovsky</strong>: Poor Bond. The cold war is over. What have
you got left? Economic espionage. Murder in the boardroom. So dull.</p>
<p><strong>his pov</strong>: ELEKTRA…more vibrant than we have ever seen
her, living up to her name. She is impossibly glamorous in a sparkling
dress that fits like second skin. Her hair is full and tumbling, her
eyes are fiery and wild.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Oh, you’d be surprised.</p>
<p><strong>zukovsky</strong>: We’ve kept your father’s chair free.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: And his account?</p>
<p><strong>zukovsky</strong>: You have a credit line of a million and a
half.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: Vodka martini.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Two. Shaken not stirred.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: What the hell are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: Someone wants to kill me, I’d rather die
looking him straight in the eye. What are you doing here? Looking for a
woman a little more your type? How about that one?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: If this little show is for my benefit, I’ll
take you home right now.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: You had your chance, James. Now I’m looking
for a bigger thrill.</p>
<p><strong>hooker</strong>: You want to be…on top, or not on top?</p>
<p><strong>davidov</strong>: On top.</p>
<p><strong>hooker</strong>: Tied up, or not tied up?</p>
<p><strong>renard</strong>: Dead, or not dead?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: I understand it’s normally good practice to
get the feel of the cards before going off the deep end.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>dealer</strong>: Bust.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: I like the deep end, James.</p>
<p><strong>renard</strong>: Is this how you spend the money I pay you?
And with the rest you hire fools who shoot like blind men?</p>
<p><strong>davidov</strong>: Bond…</p>
<p><strong>renard</strong>: Should be dead as well. Your failure today
is astonishing. It is a disgrace.</p>
<p><strong>renard</strong>: Do you know why the color is blue at the
wick?</p>
<p><strong>renard</strong>: Because that is where the flame is the
hottest.</p>
<p><strong>renard</strong>: The temperature is close to five hundred
degrees.</p>
<p><strong>davidov</strong>: The plane…it’s all been arranged…</p>
<p><strong>renard</strong>: Then you are completely unnecessary…</p>
<p><strong>davidov</strong>: I have the documents, the landing
authorizations, the security passes…</p>
<p><strong>renard</strong>: Bond is suspicious. We are moving sooner,
tonight. We understand each other?</p>
<p><strong>davidov</strong>: Yes…yes…</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Stand or split them.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: Surely you believe in living
dangerously.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Not at that price. Time to surrender.</p>
<p><strong>dealer</strong>: The House has no limit.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: Hit me.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: Time to surrender.</p>
<p><strong>davidov</strong>: A little accident.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: A night of burning passion?</p>
<p><strong>henchman</strong>: What about Bond?</p>
<p><strong>henchman</strong>: Sir? Sir?</p>
<p><strong>renard</strong>: I will take care of Mister Bond.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: You knew when you first saw me. You knew it
would be like this.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Shush.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: Poor shoulder. Looks painful…</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: …needs constant attention…</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Enough ice for one day.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: You never take this off?</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: Why do men always want to undress the one
part of a woman’s body she doesn’t want to reveal?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: How did you survive?</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: I used my body on the guards. It gave me
control. I got to a gun and I took my chance. I’ve never told anyone
that.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: Do you ever stop, James? Do you ever think
about…another kind of life?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: I can’t afford to.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: Don’t worry. I know who you are.</p>
<p><strong>davidov</strong>: I’m running late…no, no, I’ll make it…how
will they know I’m your man?…romashka…romashka…alright.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Problem, comrade?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Old habits die hard.</p>
<p><strong>inside the briefcase</strong>: FOUR STACKS OF MONEY.
Documents headed with the official crest of Miratom. A new security tag,
it looks just like the dead guy’s, but has Davidov’s name and
picture…some hologrammed security tags – and a polaroid-type camera.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Here goes nothing.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Romashka.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: You have fifteen minutes.</p>
<p><strong>colonel akakievich</strong>: You are late. The transport
documents?</p>
<p><strong>colonel akakievich</strong>: They are waiting for you below.
It should be ready. Check with the IDA physicist.</p>
<p><strong>colonel akakievich</strong>: Not interested in men. Take my
word for it.</p>
<p><strong>christmas</strong>: You new?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Yes. Viktor Davidov, Miss…?</p>
<p><strong>christmas</strong>: Doctor. Jones. Christmas Jones. No jokes,
I’ve heard them all.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Don’t know any doctor jokes.</p>
<p><strong>christmas</strong>: What happened to Len Tashka?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Couldn’t make it. Splitting headache.</p>
<p><strong>christmas</strong>: The soldiers may give you a hard time.
Whatever. If we weren’t around, they’d have their whole nuclear arsenal
lying by the roadsides, rotting in the sun.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Will I need protection?</p>
<p><strong>christmas</strong>: There’s no radiation danger down
there.</p>
<p><strong>christmas</strong>: Where is this stockpile going?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: To the nuclear facility at Penza 19.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: See the corporal, at the end of the
chamber.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Corporal?</p>
<p><strong>renard</strong>: I see my friend Davidov ran into some
difficulty.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Indeed.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Don’t come any closer.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: You can’t kill me. I’m already dead.</p>
<p><strong>renard</strong>: Go ahead. Shoot. My men will still steal the
bomb, and the shot will bring them directly to you.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Who’s paying you to destroy the pipeline?</p>
<p><strong>renard</strong>: To die by a man who can’t even grasp what
he’s caught up in…</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Revenge isn’t so hard to fathom. What’s clever
is getting someone else to pay for it.</p>
<p><strong>renard</strong>: Not many people in this world have that kind
of fortune.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>renard</strong>: You think I fear death? I welcome it. I get
on my knees and pray for it. You, on the other hand, you have something
to live for, no? She’s beautiful isn’t she? You should have seen her
before. Flawless, and still so innocent, not such a whore in bed…</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: You will never touch her. You will never get
near her.</p>
<p><strong>renard</strong>: Have you forgotten who saved your life in
Geneva?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Consider me ungrateful.</p>
<p><strong>renard</strong>: It’s I who should thank you – for taking
that money back to MI-6. So distressing for M. An explosion inside her
lair.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: She’ll get over it.</p>
<p><strong>renard</strong>: You even brought the plane for us. We really
couldn’t have done it without you.</p>
<p><strong>renard</strong>: A man tires of being executed.</p>
<p><strong>renard</strong>: But then again…There is no point in living
if you can’t…feel alive.</p>
<p><strong>colonel akakievich</strong>: Drop your gun.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Keep away, Colonel.</p>
<p><strong>christmas</strong>: He is an impostor. There’s no Davidov at
Miratom.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Here’s your imposter. He’s paid off the men on
the plane outside. They’re not taking the bomb to any Russian facility,
they’re flying it wherever he tells them.</p>
<p><strong>colonel akakievich</strong>: I said drop it.</p>
<p><strong>renard</strong>: Well done – he would have killed us all. I
suppose you were you the one who allowed him down?</p>
<p><strong>renard</strong>: Take him away, I don’t want him around as we
move the bomb. You had me. I knew you couldn’t shoulder the
responsibility…</p>
<p><strong>colonel akakievich</strong>: No – the bomb does not go
anywhere until I am satisfied. All of you to the surface, now…</p>
<p><strong>renard</strong>: Very well, Colonel. We will all go up.</p>
<p><strong>renard</strong>: Shut them.</p>
<p><strong>christmas</strong>: Melt-down doors. If he gets them closed,
they won’t be opened again for forty- eight years.</p>
<p><strong>renard</strong>: We have our fireworks. Now you can have
yours.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Close the door! Close the door!</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Shame you had to spot I wasn’t the real
thing.</p>
<p><strong>christmas</strong>: So who are you?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Bond –</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: James Bond.</p>
<p><strong>christmas</strong>: They won’t get far. Every warhead has a
locator card. A Miratom device. Emits a high-pitched signal on Russian
emergency frequencies. We can track the bomb.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: With this?</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Do we have the range of Renard’s plane?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Anywhere in this circle. Iran, Iraq,
Pakistan, Syria, Afghanistan…</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Marvellous.</p>
<p><strong>moneypenny</strong>: Elektra King is calling from Baku.</p>
<p><strong>moneypenny</strong>: It’s a video line.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Put her on the wide screen.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: I’m sorry. I would never call you
except…Bond’s disappeared. He…he left my villa, some time in the middle
of the night and…</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: My head of security has been found near a
local airstrip, murdered…</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: I’ll send someone out.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: Could…could you come?</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: I just can’t help thinking…I’m next.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Get me out there.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: Gabor…?</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: James!</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: You look surprised.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: What’s wrong with you? Are you crazy?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: A little. Does it matter? After all, what’s
the point of living if you can’t feel alive? Isn’t that right, Elektra?
Isn’t that your motto?</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Or did you steal it from your old friend
Renard?</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: …what?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: We had a run-in, he and I. He knew about us,
he knew about my shoulder, he knew exactly where to hurt me…</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: Are you saying…Renard is the man who’s
trying to kill me?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: You can drop the act, it’s over.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: I don’t know what you’re talking about!</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: I think you do.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: At MI-6 we call it Stockholm Syndrome. It’s
common in kidnappings. A young impressionable victim. Sheltered,
sexually inexperienced. A powerful kidnapper skilled in torture, in
manipulation. Something snaps in the victim’s mind. The captive falls in
love with her captor.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: How dare you! How dare you! That animal!?
That monster!? He disgusts me! You disgust me! So he knew where to hurt
you, is that it? You had a sling on your arm at the funeral! I didn’t
have to sleep with you to find that out.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: He used your exact words.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: You knew. You knew all the time, that he
was out there, that he was coming for me, and you lied. You used me, you
used me as bait. You made love to me – what, to pass the time as you
waited for him to strike?</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: He’s struck again. Five men are dead at the
pipeline.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: I’m coming with you.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: You do what you have to do, but I’ve called
in M. She’s en route from London even now.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Glad to see you’ve turned up.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: They hit about 90 minutes ago. There’s a
scientist here from the International Decommissioning Agency, Dr. Jones.
She has ten crews combing the area.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: I’ll see how they’re coming with the
power…</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: You had your hand on the bomb and you let Renard
get away with it.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: The report King bought. It’s a manual.
Renard’s men used it to remove this radio tracking device from the
warhead.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Then Robert was right about a Russian
connection.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: They’re getting their weapons from the
Russians, but where are they getting the money to buy the weapons? I
can’t help thinking…the person close to King, the one who switched that
pin…</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: The inside man?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Is maybe…the inside woman.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: A woman?</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: That’s not right.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: It’s an observation and repair rig. Travels
along the pipe, checks for broken seals. But it’s not supposed to be
there.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Stop it.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: I don’t understand…</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Where is the rig?</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: The parcel’s in the post.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: It’s heading for the oil terminal.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Where it can do the most damage.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: My God. Have the terminal evacuated.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Speed?</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: Full on. Seventy miles an hour.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: One hundred and six miles from the
terminal.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: It’ll reach the other end in seventy- eight
minutes. Any more of these rigs?</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: There’s one parked in the passageway
ahead of it.</p>
<p><strong>christmas</strong>: I’ll need some help…</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Unless you’d like to see my ID first.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Be one along any minute.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: When this is over we should bury the hatchet.
Celebrate. A champagne dinner?</p>
<p><strong>christmas</strong>: When this is over our bodies may be blown
to smithereens.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Alright then, brunch.</p>
<p><strong>radio man</strong>: Tanner reports Bond is headed for the
rendezvous.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Excellent. Evacuate Miss King and the others.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: You can evacuate my workers, but I’m not
going anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Faster! Get our speed up!</p>
<p><strong>christmas</strong>: Tactical fission device. Low yield.</p>
<p><strong>close inside the bomb</strong>: the timer. 1:45 MINUTES.</p>
<p><strong>christmas</strong>: The plutonium is missing. They’ve taken
the core!</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Then it’s no longer a bomb?</p>
<p><strong>christmas</strong>: It’s a bomb alright. We’re still dead if
the trigger charge goes off…</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Let it blow.</p>
<p><strong>christmas</strong>: But we can stop it.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Let it blow.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Trust me. Leave it.</p>
<p><strong>gabor</strong>: It wasn’t nuclear…the bomb was a dud. The
trigger charge blew out a fifty yard section of pipeline…</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: And Bond?</p>
<p><strong>gabor</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: Do you think he’s dead?</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: We just have to wait.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: I have a gift for you. Something that
belonged to my father. He would have wanted you to have it.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Perhaps this isn’t the time…</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: He often spoke of how…compassionately you
advised him on the best course of action during my kidnapping.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: It’s very valuable, you know. I just
couldn’t let it explode with the rest of him.</p>
<p><strong>gabor and another security man shoot m’s two guards in
the</strong>: HEAD…point blank, cold blood. The men fall.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: Take her to the chopper.</p>
<p><strong>christmas</strong>: What the hell were you doing? You nearly
killed us!</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: I did kill us. She thinks we’re dead. And she
thinks she got away with it.</p>
<p><strong>christmas</strong>: What the hell are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: It’s part of some plan. She dresses it up like
a terrorist attack. The explosion covers up the theft of the
plutonium.</p>
<p><strong>christmas</strong>: Who’s she?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Elektra King.</p>
<p><strong>christmas</strong>: Elektra King? Are you insane? This is her
pipeline.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Makes her look even more innocent.</p>
<p><strong>christmas</strong>: What would she want with weapons grade
plutonium?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: I was hoping you could tell me.</p>
<p><strong>christmas</strong>: You steal an old bomb, small by today’s
standards, about the size of the one that destroyed Nagasaki, take the
plutonium core out of it, intending to use it… To make a bigger, better
bomb.</p>
<p><strong>christmas</strong>: I have to get after that core. This is my
ass.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Tanner to 007, do you read?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Loud and clear. I have to speak to M.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: She’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: She’s disappeared. And two of our men have
been killed.</p>
<p><strong>christmas</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: She just upped the stakes. All her chips are
on the table now. And M’s life is part of the bet.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: I know I promised you champagne, but would you
settle for caviar?</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: You’re hurting me.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: Brought me something?</p>
<p><strong>renard</strong>: Go on. It’s safe. Touch your destiny.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: Warm.</p>
<p><strong>renard</strong>: Is it?</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: I’ve brought something for you as well.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: Just as I promised.</p>
<p><strong>renard</strong>: My executioner.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Over-praise, I’m afraid. But my people will
finish the job.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: Your people? Your people will leave you
here to rot just like you left me. You and my father. He didn’t think my
life was worth the chump change he spent on a day at the stock
market.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Your father…</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: Is nothing. His kingdom he stole from my
mother. The kingdom I will rightly take back.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: She’s insane. Is that what you did to her?</p>
<p><strong>renard</strong>: No. I’m afraid it is what you did.</p>
<p><strong>renard</strong>: When I took her she was…promise itself. So
clever, so vibrant, so…full of life force. And you left her there, at
the mercy of a man like me. You ruined her. For what? To get to me? She
is worth fifty of me.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: For once, I agree with you.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: So she used all that brilliance to get revenge on
her father, on me.</p>
<p><strong>renard</strong>: No. I wanted you. I wanted you for
myself.</p>
<p><strong>renard</strong>: Since you sent your man to kill me, I have
been watching time tick slowly away, marching inevitably toward my own
death. Watch these hands, M. At noon tomorrow, your time is up. And I
guarantee you…I will not miss. You will die. Along with everyone in this
city and the future of the West.</p>
<p><strong>zukovsky</strong>: What are doing, Bond? Trying to impress
this innocent thing?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: She’s no innocent. This is my nuclear
consultant.</p>
<p><strong>zukovsky</strong>: Ah, I see. A purely…plutonic
relationship.</p>
<p><strong>zukovsky</strong>: Really Bond, couldn’t you find a nice
Russian scientist with hair growing out of his ears?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: What’s your business with Elektra King?</p>
<p><strong>zukovsky</strong>: I thought you were the one in her
business.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: She dropped a million and half dollars to the
House – your House. And you didn’t even bat an eyelid. She was paying
you off. What for?</p>
<p><strong>zukovsky</strong>: As ever you are the spy who has to see a
plot wherever he looks.</p>
<p><strong>zukovsky</strong>: That is 5,000 dollars of Beluga
ruined!</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: You are out of your league. She’s working with
Renard.</p>
<p><strong>christmas</strong>: They’ve stolen a nuclear device.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Tell us what you know, Zukovsky. Tell us,
before its too late.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Now…where were we?</p>
<p><strong>zukovsky</strong>: A rope!</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: No. The truth! She thought I was dead – those
blades were meant for you. What do you know that she would kill you
for?</p>
<p><strong>zukovsky</strong>: I don’t know what you’re talking –</p>
<p><strong>zukovsky</strong>: Help me, don’t let me drown.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: You’re in this thing up to your neck.</p>
<p><strong>zukovsky</strong>: Alright, alright! Sometimes I smuggle
machinery for her. Russian stuff.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: And the payoff on the tables?</p>
<p><strong>zukovsky</strong>: A special job. A…a…a submarine.</p>
<p><strong>christmas</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>zukovsky</strong>: To haul some cargo. My nephew, he is
Captain of a sub in the Black Sea Fleet.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Where’s the sub going?!</p>
<p><strong>zukovsky</strong>: No! Get me out!</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: This is too big for even you. Where is it?</p>
<p><strong>zukovsky</strong>: This is a family matter! If my nephew is
in danger, we do it my way, or nothing! Now get me out!</p>
<p><strong>zukovsky</strong>: No! Bond!</p>
<p><strong>christmas</strong>: Bond!</p>
<p><strong>christmas</strong>: Commander Bond, you are dangerous,
unpredictable, and a hothead.</p>
<p><strong>christmas</strong>: But then again, explosive devices are my
specialty.</p>
<p><strong>zukovsky</strong>: So. My way. No MI-6, no Interpol. Just
you, me and my people.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>zukovsky</strong>: Istanbul.</p>
<p><strong>renard</strong>: So beautiful. So smooth, so warm.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: How would you know?</p>
<p><strong>renard</strong>: Why are you like this? Because Bond is dead?
It’s what you wanted.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: Of course…</p>
<p><strong>renard</strong>: He was a…good lover?</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>renard</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: What about this?</p>
<p><strong>renard</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: But surely…</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: …You can feel this?</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: Remember … pleasure?</p>
<p><strong>zukovsky</strong>: Any luck reaching Yevgeny?</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Negative, comrade.</p>
<p><strong>christmas</strong>: What is this place?</p>
<p><strong>zukovsky</strong>: Former KGB surveillance post. The Dye
Factory was just a front; now it turns a good profit.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Your old friend Dmitri.</p>
<p><strong>zukovsky</strong>: Today, you are glad to have the Boa on
your side.</p>
<p><strong>zukovsky</strong>: In the good old days, the KGB had three or
four spots where our submarines could surface without anyone knowing.
But Yevgeny is supposed to be loading cargo.</p>
<p><strong>christmas</strong>: What class sub does your nephew run?</p>
<p><strong>zukovsky</strong>: C-class.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Nuclear.</p>
<p><strong>christmas</strong>: Not just nuclear. Powered by a nuclear
reactor. He’s not loading any cargo. They want the sub. The sub itself.
Put weapons grade plutonium inside the sub’s reactor: Instant,
catastrophic meltdown.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Made to look just like an accident.</p>
<p><strong>zukovsky</strong>: Mother of God.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: The right kind of explosion in the right spot
– it would block the Bosphorus, cut off the Black Sea.</p>
<p><strong>christmas</strong>: But why? Eight million people would die,
the land irradiated for a hundred years. A cloud of radiation the size
of Europe…</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Because an explosion like that would kill all
the other pipelines. There would be only one way to get the oil out of
the Caspian and pump it to the world…</p>
<p><strong>christmas</strong>: The King pipeline.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Elektra would control it all.</p>
<p><strong>zukovsky</strong>: If what you say it true…it may be too late
for Yevgeny.</p>
<p><strong>renard</strong>: Captain…</p>
<p><strong>yevgeny</strong>: Sir. We are ready to load your cargo. We
only have a few hours before we’ll be missed.</p>
<p><strong>renard</strong>: You came with a skeleton crew?</p>
<p><strong>yevgeny</strong>: That’s all we can afford these days.</p>
<p><strong>renard</strong>: Of course. We are grateful for your
efforts.</p>
<p><strong>renard</strong>: We have brandy and other refreshments for
your men.</p>
<p><strong>zukovsky</strong>: If we’re not in time and something has
happened to him… you must let me kill them.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Whoever gets there first, Zukovsky. They have
M.</p>
<p><strong>renard</strong>: Take them up and throw them in the sea.</p>
<p><strong>renard</strong>: We’ll be underway in two hours. Use that
time to re-familiarize yourselves with your stations. Then ponder how
rich you’ll be. The re-breathers for the escape are already on
board.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: Now you know how it feels. To be locked
away, to wonder if they’re coming for you, if anyone will ever come for
you.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Someone will come.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: Who? Bond? Bond is dead.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: Somehow, I find that strangely
…disappointing.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Elektra. What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: Time for you to die.</p>
<p><strong>renard</strong>: The reactor is secured.</p>
<p><strong>renard</strong>: This is the end.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: No. It is the beginning. The world will
never be the same.</p>
<p><strong>renard</strong>: It will be yours, and yours alone. Have fun
with it.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Comrade, it’s faint, but I’m getting
something. A signal. Transmitting at…37- 19 degrees north…</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: The locator card. It’s M.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: The rest?</p>
<p><strong>christmas</strong>: Forty, forty-three degrees East…</p>
<p><strong>zukovsky</strong>: The Maiden’s Tower.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: How appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>zukovsky</strong>: I’d heard there were some renovations
there…no one would look for a sub in that place in a million years.</p>
<p><strong>christmas</strong>: Zukovsky…</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: If I don’t get to the Boa before he gets to
Maiden’s Tower, M is dead.</p>
<p><strong>boa</strong>: For years I was told I could never take the
great James Bond and his Walther PPK. What good is your gun now,
Bond?</p>
<p><strong>gabor</strong>: Welcome aboard, Mr. Bond.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: James Bond and his amazing resurrection. If
only you’d kept away, we might have met again in a few years, become
lovers once more.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: Take her to Renard.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: Pretty thing. You had her too?</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: I could have given you the world.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Not interested.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: They were digging near here and they found
some very pretty vases. They also found this… I think we ignore the old
ways at our peril, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Where’s M?</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: Soon she’ll be everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: All this, because you fell for Renard?</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: Five more turns and your neck will
break.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: Since I was a child, I’ve always had a
power over men. When I realized my father wouldn’t rescue me from the
kidnappers, I knew I had to form a new alliance.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: You turned Renard.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: Just like you…only you were even
easier.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: I told him he had to hurt me, he had to
make it look real. When he refused I told him I would do it myself.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: So you killed your father.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: He killed me! He killed me the day he
refused to pay my ransom.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Was this all about the oil?</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: It is my oil! Mine and my family’s!</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: It runs in my veins, thicker than blood.
I’m going to redraw the map. And when I am through the whole world will
know my name, my grandfather’s name, the glory of my people.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: No-one will believe this melt-down was an
accident.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: They will believe. They will all
believe.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: You understand? Nobody can resist me.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: Know what happens when a man is
strangled?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Elektra, it’s not too late. Eight million
people needn’t die.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: You should have killed me when you had the
chance. But you couldn’t. Not me. A woman you’ve loved.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: You meant … nothing … to me.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: One… last… screw?</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: Oh James.</p>
<p><strong>zukovsky</strong>: I’m looking for a submarine. It’s big and
black, and the driver is a friend of mine.</p>
<p><strong>zukovsky</strong>: Bring it to me.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: What a shame. You just missed him.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: Everything’s under control up here. Are you
ready?</p>
<p><strong>renard</strong>: Yes. Au revoir…</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: Zukovsky really hated you. Time to say
goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: James. You can’t kill me. Not in cold
blood.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Bond –</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Go after the submarine, forget the girl.
Bond!</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Call him off.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: I won’t ask again. Call him off!</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: Renard.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: You wouldn’t kill me. You’d miss me.</p>
<p><strong>elektra</strong>: Dive! Bond –</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: I never miss.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: How do you want to die? That? Or this?</p>
<p><strong>christmas</strong>: James!…</p>
<p><strong>renard</strong>: Flood tanks 4 and 5…</p>
<p><strong>christmas</strong>: Is there another way?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: We go down to the torpedo bay.</p>
<p><strong>renard</strong>: Open the tanks.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Tanks open.</p>
<p><strong>renard</strong>: Bond…</p>
<p><strong>renard</strong>: Bond! You have decided to join me on this
historic voyage. Welcome to my nuclear family.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: You’re really going to commit suicide for
her?</p>
<p><strong>renard</strong>: In case you’ve forgotten. I’m dead
already.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Haven’t you heard the news? So is she.</p>
<p><strong>renard</strong>: You will die for this.</p>
<p><strong>christmas</strong>: The cover is off the reactor.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: He’s sealed himself in.</p>
<p><strong>christmas</strong>: He’s going to insert the plutonium.</p>
<p><strong>christmas</strong>: Do you know what you’re doing?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Like riding a bike.</p>
<p><strong>christmas</strong>: What kind of bikes did you ride?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Just wanted to put him on edge…</p>
<p><strong>renard</strong>: Open the torpedo tubes.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Climb!</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Keep moving.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: There’s one chance.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Re-breathers.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Never liked those things anyway.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Count to twenty. When you get to twenty open
the hatch. It can only be opened for a few seconds or we’ll sink.</p>
<p><strong>christmas</strong>: But what if…</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Count to twenty. I’ll be there.</p>
<p><strong>christmas</strong>: One, one thousand, two, one thousand…</p>
<p><strong>christmas</strong>: Fourteen, one thousand, fifteen, one
thousand…</p>
<p><strong>christmas</strong>: Twenty.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Christmas!</p>
<p><strong>bond’s pov</strong>: in the intense glow inside – the
overheating rod, protruding slightly.</p>
<p><strong>christmas</strong>: We have to get the rod out of the
reactor!</p>
<p><strong>christmas</strong>: Melting down. 4000 degrees, the Zirconium
casings on the rods crack. 5000, the plutonium melts. In ten minutes, a
hydrogen explosion.</p>
<p><strong>the gauge is passing 4900, edging towards the
no-way-back</strong>: 5000 MARK. Meltdown imminent…</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: She’s waiting for you.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: We’re sinking.</p>
<p><strong>christmas</strong>: Help me. We have to seal it.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: We’ve got to get out.</p>
<p><strong>christmas</strong>: We can’t.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Any word from him?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Still no contact yet.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: I love Christmas in Turkey.</p>
<p><strong>christmas</strong>: So isn’t it time you unwrapped your
present?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: That’s strange.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: He must be nearby.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>q</strong>: This picks up body heat. Humans should be orange.
There.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: I thought you said he was with Doctor Jones?</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: It’s getting redder.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Bond.</p>
<p><strong>q</strong>: Could be a premature form of the Millennium
Bug.</p>
<p><strong>christmas</strong>: You know James… I think Christmas is
coming early this year.</p>
