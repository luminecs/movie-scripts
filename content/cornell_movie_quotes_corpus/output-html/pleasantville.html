<p><strong>college counselor</strong>: … For those of you going on to
college next year, the chance of finding a good job will actually
decrease by the time you graduate. Entry level jobs will drop from
thirty-one to twenty-six percent, and the median income for those jobs
will go down as well …</p>
<p><strong>college counselor</strong>: Obviously, my friends, it’s a
competitive world and good grades are your only ticket through. By the
year Two Thousand …</p>
<p><strong>health teacher</strong>: … The chance of contracting HIV from
a promiscuous lifestyle will climb to one in one hundred and fifty. The
odds of dying in an auto accident are only one in twenty-five hundred.
Now this marks a drastic increase …</p>
<p><strong>science teacher</strong>: … From just four years ago when
ozone depletion was at ten percent of its current level. By the time you
are twenty years old, average global temperature will have risen two and
a half degrees. Even a shift of one degree can cause such catastrophic
consequences as typhoons, floods, widespread drought and famine.</p>
<p><strong>science teacher</strong>: Okay. Who can tell me what famine
is?</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Honey, I’m home.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Hello darling.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: How was your day?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh, swell. You know, Mr. Connel said that if
things keep going the way they are, I might be seeing that promotion
sooner than I thought.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Oh darling that’s wonderful! I always knew
you could do it.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hey, Pumpkin! What’s that smell? Is that
your meat loaf?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: “It might be …”</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: It might be.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh Pumpkin! You sure know the way to this
man’s heart.</p>
<p><strong>david’s mom</strong>: … Bullshit Barry, that wasn’t the
deal</p>
<p><strong>david’s mom</strong>: No–you have custody the first weekend
of every month and this is the first weekend … I don’t care if yesterday
was the thirtieth, this is still the first weekend.</p>
<p><strong>david’s mom</strong>: No I can’t bail you out, I’m supposed
to go to La Costa … Well if I want to get a mud bath, that’s really my
business, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hey. Where are those kids?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: “Right behind you father.”</p>
<p><strong>bud and mary sue together</strong>: Right behind you
father.</p>
<p><strong>marysue</strong>: Mother … Father … Bud has a little surprise
for you.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: What’s that Bud?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: First prize at the science fair. There were
lots of swell projects–guess mine was just the “swellest”.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Darling that’s wonderful. Except there’s no
such word as “swellest”.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Well gee whizz, Mom. lt wasn’t the “English”
fair.</p>
<p><strong>david’s mom</strong>: Well sure they can stay by themselves,
Barry, but that’s not the point. You said you’d take them. Well
fine–they’ll stay by themselves then.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What’s a mother to do?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Oh–what’s a mother to do?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Hi. I mean … … Hi.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Look. You probably don’t think I should be
asking you this. I mean–not knowing you well and all …</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I mean I know you–everybody knows you … I
just don’t know you … technically.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Well–I was just wondering–’cause I see you
all the time in Algebra and I heard you humming that Van Halen song and
I really like that song too … Anyhow, I don’t know what you’re doing
this weekend but my Mom’s leaving town and she said I could use her car
so …</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Okay, whose window did Bud break when he was
playing with his father’s golf clubs?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Easy. Mr. Jenkins. What JOB did Mr. Jenkins
have?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Salesman. What did Bud and Mary Sue name the
cat they found in the gutter?</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Scout?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Marmalade.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Okay–here’s one: Why did their parents come
home early from their weekend at the lake?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: ’Cause Bud didn’t answer the phone and they
were worried about him.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: You’re unbelievable. You’ll win this thing
for sure. When is it on?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Marathon starts at 6:30. Contest’s tomorrow
at noon.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: A thousand dollars … And it’s on all
night?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Of course it is Howard. That’s why they call
it a Marathon.</p>
<p><strong>kimmy</strong>: Omigod, it’s so mortifying, being related to
him. I can’t believe you’re like–</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Only on my parent’s side.</p>
<p><strong>kimmy</strong>: I know, but you’re like … twins and stuff.
You must be from like, the cool side of the uterus.</p>
<p><strong>kimmy</strong>: Omigod, omigod–here they come.</p>
<p><strong>christin</strong>: Don’t do anything. Just don’t like–do
anything …</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Hi Mark.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>mark’s lackeys</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer’s lackeys</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Saw you at the mall yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Yeah … Saw you too.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: So you watching Pearl Jam on MTV
tonight?</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: My mom’ll be out of town.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: So uh … Maybe we could uh …</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Cool.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Cool.</p>
<p><strong>various lackeys</strong>: Cool.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: … I know, I know–He’s just like so FINE …
I’m still like: “Omigod.”</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: It was amazing, Daph … I’m like: “Well my
Mom’ll be out of town.” And he’s like “Well then, maybe we could– you
know …” And I’m like “Yeah, sure.” And he’s like “Well, cool.” I know,
he’s just so smart. I don’t know. Maybe that black thing I just got. It
is not slutty, Daph, it’s cute. Well, “hello?” He’s not coming over here
to study … I know. Well I’m jealous of you too sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: … He’s not homeless Howard, they just don’t
say where he lives. Well it’s a silly question. Because nobody’s
homeless in Pleasantville.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: … because that’s just not what it’s like.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Listen Howard–it’s almost six-thirty. I gotta
go.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: David, cut it out. Mark Davis is gonna

<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: Holy cow. Look at that. Had a little
disaster didn’t ya fella.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Yeah … Sort of …</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: We’ll get you fixed up in no
time.</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: I know how I’d feel if mine went out.
Almost like losing a friend.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You know, we didn’t call any TV repair.</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: Well that makes it a lucky day for
both of us, hunh?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: You think you could do this like soon?
It’s almost six thirty.</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: What’s the rush?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: The Pleasantville Marathon starts at six
thirty.</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: Pleasantville?</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: Gosh, I loved that show. Watched it
for years.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: That’s not the reason. I’ve got a date at
six thirty.</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: Hey–who did Muff in take to the
masquerade ball when her date came down with the measles?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: … Her father.</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: Right. And how did she dress him?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: … Like Prince Charming.</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: Nice … Nice …</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Um–hello? I’ve got like a social emergency
here.</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: Remember the one where Bud lost his
cousin when he was s’posed to be watching him?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Yeah …</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: What department store did they go
to?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: McIntire’s.</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: McGinty’s.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: No. McIntire’s. Remember: “For the very best
in men’s attire, Head right down to McIntire’s.”</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: Say–why don’t you take this remote
instead. It’s got a little more “Ooomph” in it.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Ooomph?</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: Sure. Big beautiful set like this–you
want something that’ll put you right in the show.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: We’ll take it.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: How much does it cost?</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: Oh–couldn’t charge you for something
like that. It’s free.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Free?</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: Oh sure. Big fan like yourself. It’s
the least I could do.</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: Well, I better get going. Your show’s
almost on, and … It’s almost time for your date.</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: Take care now.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Hunh.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Lemme see that.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: No way.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Gee whizz, Mary Sue–why can’t I borrow your
transistor radio?</p>
<p><strong>mary sue</strong>: I promised Betty Jane she could use it
over the weekend.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Do you mind. This is like the most
important moment of my whole life.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Forget it Jen, I’ve waited a year for
this.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: “But I told Mr. Miller I’d bring a transistor
in to electric shop.”</p>
<p><strong>mary sue</strong>: “And I told Betty Jean she could have it
for the picnic with Roy.”</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: God, David. Just give it to me!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Get lost!</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: YOU get lost!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Oh my God.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’m not sure.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hi Sport, hi Muffin … Better get a move on,
you’re gonna be late for school.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: What did you do?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Uchh! Look at me?! I’m like so …
pasty!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Psst! Over here.</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: Told you it was your lucky day. Bet
you thought I was just a fan or something.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: A miracle.</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: … See, every time I thought I’d found
someone they’d turn out to disappoint me. They’d know the early
episodes, but they wouldn’t know the later ones … They’d know all about
Muffin but they wouldn’t know about Bud …</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What the hell’s going on!</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: Shh! Can’t talk like that now. You’re
in … You know …</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Bud. Mary Sue … Breakfast is on the
table.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: We’re in Pleasantville?</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: Dream come true, hunh?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: This isn’t funny! I happen to have a very
important date in like five minutes!</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: Well, you don’t have to worry about
that anymore.</p>
<p><strong>mark davis</strong>: … Bitch.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Noooooo!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You–you gotta get us out of here.</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: Why would I do that?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Because we don’t belong!</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: Oh sure you do … “McIntire’s
Department store” … “Their father dressed as Prince Charming.” That was
gorgeous Bud.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: My name’s David.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Oh GOD …</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: You know–this is a pretty strange way
of showing your appreciation.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Look–we appreciate it. We really do. We
just–we want to go home now.</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: But you don’t know how long I’ve been
looking for someone like you.</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: I’m very disappointed … In fact … I’m
starting to get a little upset.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Don’t get upset.</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: Weil wouldn’t you! You look for
someone for years … You pour your heart into it … This is a privilege
you know. I don’t think I better talk about this right now.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Where are you going …</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: I don’t think we should discuss this
until I’m a little bit more composed.</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: Maybe in a day or so when I’m not so
emotional …</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Oh God.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: What’s going to happen?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I don’t know … It’s not possible … Is it
possible?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Bu-ud … Mary Sue … Your breakfast is getting
cold.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It can’t be possible.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Well, come on kids. You’re not going off to
school without a hot breakfast inside you …</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Forward march.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I just love you in that sweater Mary-Sue.
It’s so flattering.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Morning kids. Better get a move on or you’re
going to be late for school.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I don’t believe this.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Neither do I.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, c’mon. Dig in.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I put blueberries in them just the way you
like.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Actually–I’m not real … hungry.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Oh nonsense young lady. You’re going to start
your day with a nice big breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Here. Why don’t you have some waffle cakes.
And there’s sausage and eggs and some good crisp bacon … … And a ham
steak.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: … And of course, a nice big bowl of
oatmeal.</p>
<p><strong>pat boone</strong>: “… Tooty fruity–oh rooty. Tooty Fruity …
Oh rooty.”</p>
<p><strong>pat boone</strong>: “… Tooty fruity–oh rooty …”</p>
<p><strong>pat boone</strong>: “… A wap bop a loo bop–a wap barn
boom.”</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I’m gonna hurl, David. I swear to God.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Just take deep breaths.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: All that animal fat. I feel it in my pores
or something.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I still don’t see why we’re doing
this.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: We’re supposed to be in school.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: We’re supposed to be at home David! We’re
supposed to be in color! Oh God …</p>
<p><strong>mr. simpson</strong>: Hello Bud.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Hello Mr. Simpson.</p>
<p><strong>mr. simpson</strong>: Hear your Dad got a new car.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Oh yeah. A Buick. It’s swell.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: You know him?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Owns the hardware store.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Okay, now you listen to me! I don’t know
what’s going on but you’d better fix it! I had a date with Mark Davis
and I even bought new UNDERWEAR!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: We just gotta play along for a little while …
till that guy shows up again. Then I’ll talk to him and …</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Play along?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Well, yeah. I’m … Bud Parker and you’re …
um–Mary Sue.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: No! I’m not gonna do it! If I don’t dress
like this for Mom I’m sure as hell not going to do it for you!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: We don’t have a choice Jen. We’re stuck until
he comes back.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Why can’t we just EXPLAIN IT?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: To who?</p>
<p><strong>fireman</strong>: C’mere, kitty …</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Oh God, we are. We’re stuck in like
“Nerdville”. I always knew you’d pay a price for this. I knew you
couldn’t be hopelessly geekridden for this long without suffering some
like, really tragic consequences. … But it’s just not fair. I mean–I’m
starting to get really–popular. Debbi Russell transferred to another
school and my skin’s been great since March and Mark Davis is starting
to come around and …</p>
<p><strong>boy’s voice</strong>: Hello Mary Sue.</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: What’s all the commotion? Where’s the cat?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Um … It’s …</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: Ah, right … Well–guess I’ll see ya later Mary
Sue.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Who’s that?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Biff Martin. Captain of the basketball
team.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Does he–you know–like “me”?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: As a matter of fact he does.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Hunh.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Those are my friends.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Peggy Jane, Lisa Anne and Betty Jean.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Can we do any better?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>lisa anne</strong>: Mary Sue. You’re gonna be late for
Geography.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Okay …</p>
<p><strong>miss peters</strong>: Last week Class, we discussed the
geography of Main Street. This week, we’re going to be talking about Elm
Street. Can anyone tell me one of the differences between Elm Street and
Main Street? Tommy.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: It’s not as long?</p>
<p><strong>miss peters</strong>: That’s right, Tommy. It’s not as long.
Also, it only has houses. So the geography of Main Street is different
than the geography of Elm Street.</p>
<p><strong>miss peters</strong>: Mary Sue.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: What’s outside of Pleasantville?</p>
<p><strong>miss peters</strong>: What? I don’t understand …</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Outside of Pleasantville … What’s at the
end of Main Street?</p>
<p><strong>miss peters</strong>: Oh, Mary Sue. You should know the
answer to that. The end of Main Street is just the beginning again.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p><strong>coach</strong>: That’s it men. Keep it up. Big game
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: Bud …</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: Hi ya Bud.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Hi ya Biff.</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: Can I ask you a question?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: Well … If I was to ask your sister … What I
mean is, if I was to go up to Mary Sue …</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Oh God! Are we in that episode?</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I don’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You want to ask her out tonight, right? And
then you want to give her your school pin …</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: Yeah … How’d you know?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Lucky guess. Look, Biff … I don’t think it’s
a real good time for that right now …</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What I mean is … Mary Sue’s been a little
“different” lately …</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: She won’t go out with me?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I didn’t say that. It’s just that right now
…</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: I don’t know what I’d do if she wouldn’t go
out with me …</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Look, I’m sure we’ll work something out. I’ll
talk to her or something.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Honest. It’ll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: No way.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: One date, Jen–that’s all I’m asking. If you
don’t go out with this guy we could throw their whole universe out of
whack.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: It’s too weird David. This place is giving
me the creeps. Did you know all the books are blank?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I looked in the library. They got covers
with nothing inside them.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What were you doing in a library?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I got lost. Oh here … look at this!</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Just watch. You know why those guys just
get cats out of trees? ’Cause nothing burns around here, that’s why!
They don’t need any firemen …</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Jen, listen …</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I like–really need a cigarette, too.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’ll get us out of here. I really will. But
if we don’t play along we could alter their whole existence. We may
never get home.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: You really think anybody’s gonna, like,
notice if I don’t have a chocolate malt with this guy.</p>
<p><strong>peggy jane</strong>: You won’t believe what we just
heard.</p>
<p><strong>lisa anne</strong>: Biff Martin’s going to ask you out.</p>
<p><strong>betty jean</strong>: And that’s not all …</p>
<p><strong>peggy jane</strong>: No, that’s not all …</p>
<p><strong>all three together</strong>: He’s going to give you his
pin!</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: You sure I’m supposed to wear this?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I could like kill a guy with these
things.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It’s in your closet.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I’ve worn some kinky stuff before …</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: He won’t notice anyway.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: They don’t notice that kind of thing.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: So what’s the point?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Jen please …</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: He-llo? I’ve got like three pounds of
underwire here …</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Just go with the program–hunh? I’m late for
work.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: Bud?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Sorry … I had to help my folks and then I
couldn’t find my hat …</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: I didn’t know what to do.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: Well–I always wipe down the counter and
then you set out the napkins and glasses and then I make the french
fries …</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Yeah …</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: But you didn’t come so I kept on
wiping.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You know, if this ever happens again, you can
make the fries even if I haven’t put out the napkins yet.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: I’m so glad you’re here.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: Oh. Mary Sue …</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Peppermint shake, chocolate soda, two orders
of fries and a split?</p>
<p><strong>teen age girl</strong>: Peppermint soda, two chocolate
shakes, order of fries, and we’ll split it.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: There aren’t any cheeseburgers.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: Well, usually I put out the burger and
then you finish with the lettuce …</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Listen to me!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Do you have the lettuce?</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: … Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Have you cooked the burgers?</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Well you can just put on the lettuce, finish
the burger and pretend it was me doing it all along.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Really. It’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: I sure am glad you said you’d come out with me
tonight Mary Sue.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Well “gee whizz” Biff. I sure am glad you
asked me.</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: I don’t know if I ever said this to you
before, but, well … I think you’re just about the keenest girl in the
whole school …</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Really Biff? The keenest?</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: Oh yeah.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Gosh. I hardly know what to say.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What can I get you two?</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: Oh, I dunno Bud. Guess I’ll have my usual
cheeseburger and a cherry coke.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Oh, I dunno Bud. Guess I’ll just have a
salad and an Evian Water.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Cheeseburger it is.</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: See the whole time we were in civics together,
I really wanted to sit next to you–but you were always sitting between
Peggy Jane and Lisa Anne.</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: … And you always seemed so smart and
everything. Like that report you did on “Our Town Hall.” Gosh. I didn’t
know what I’d talk to you about.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Well, sometimes talking’s over-rated.
Don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: Hunh? Oh, right …</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: So I know I haven’t been steady with anybody,
but I just don’t want to rush it. You don’t want to make a mistake with
something that important.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Oh, gosh no.</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: I mean, there’s kids that are even holding
hands already but I figure there’s plenty of time for that kind of thing
later on. Don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Oh you bet. Will you excuse me for a
sec?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Jesus Chirist …</p>
<p><strong>girl’s voices</strong>: “Did he give it to you … Did he give
it to you … I bet he gave it to her … Did he give it to you?”</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I don’t think he knows how.</p>
<p><strong>lisa anne</strong>: I bet he’s gonna take her to Lover’s
Lane.</p>
<p><strong>peggy jane</strong>: I bet he is. I bet he is.</p>
<p><strong>betty jean</strong>: I bet he’s even gonna hold her hand!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Couple of cheeseburgers and two cherry cokes.
If you need anything, I’ll be right over there.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Gee whiz “Bud”, what could we possibly
need when we have each other?</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: Anyhow … I really wanted to come over and sit
next to you in civics but …</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: You want to get out of here?</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: You wanna get out of here? You wanna
leave?</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: But where would we go?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: … Lover’s Lane.</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: Lover’s Lane!</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Yeah. Lover’s Lane. You up for it?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: C’mon. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Thanks a lot.</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: Sure is pretty.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Oh yeah … Gorgeous.</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: To be honest Mary Sue. I didn’t think you’d
want to come here until we’d been pinned for a little while.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Oh, Biff. You can “pin” me any time you
want to.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Or maybe I should just “pin” you.</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: Oh, that’s silly Mary Sue. How could you
possibly pin me?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Bud?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Son, what’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Have you seen Mary Sue?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Why no. She’s still on her date with Biff …
is something the matter?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: No, I … I was just … worried about her.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Bud, your sister’s a little older now and
she’s naturally going to start going out with boys. … In fact pretty
soon–she’s even going to get married and make someone a good little
home-maker like your mother here. That’s IF she can learn to bake.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Oh, George …</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: But your sister is a fine young woman and
she would never do anything for us to be concerned about.</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: I think I better go home now Mary Sue …</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: … Why?</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: I think … I might be ill …</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: I think something’s happening to me.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: It’s s’posed to happen, Biff.</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: It is?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Trust me …</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Do you want some more cookies?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Oh no … I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: How ’bout some Marshmallow Rice Squares?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Now who could that be.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Oh hi!</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: Hi there. You took off so quick. I
wasn’t sure if you were okay.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Oh, yeah. Sorry. I’m fine. I just … Had to
get home early.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: Bud …</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Yeah …</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: You know how when we close up, I close
the register, then you lower the shades, then I turn out the lights,
then we both lock the doors.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Yeah …</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: Well you weren’t around this time so I
did the whole thing myself.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: Not only that, I didn’t even do it in
the same order. First I lowered the shades, then I closed the
register.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: Oh, hello Betty.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Hello Bill.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Well, look, thanks for coming by. I … really
appreciate it.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Well gee thanks Biff. I had a really
wonderful time.</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: … Me too.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Hello Mr. Johnson.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: Oh, hello Mary Sue.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What did you do to him?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What do you mean “nothing?” That’s not
nothing. That’s …</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Relax “Bud.” We had a really nice time. …
Now I’m really tired and we gotta get up early for school in the morning
so …</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: ’Night.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Bud. It’s 7:30 in the morning. Are you
watching television?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Oh no …</p>
<p><strong>coach</strong>: Come on men. Let’s go. Big game next
week.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Oh my God …</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You can’t do this, Jennifer. I WARNED
you.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: So what’s the big deal. Oh. Okay. They’re
like not good at basketball anymore. Like–omigod, what a tragedy.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You don’t understand. You’re messing with
their UNIVERSE.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Well maybe it needs to be messed with. Did
that ever like–occur to you? You know, they don’t want to be like this,
it’s just that nobody ever helped them before.</p>
<p><strong>peggy jane</strong>: “MS”. How you doin’?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Kewl “PJ”. How you doin’?</p>
<p><strong>peggy jane</strong>: “Kewl.”</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You have no right to do this.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Well if I don’t who will?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: They’re happy like this.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: David, nobody’s happy in a Poodle skirt
and a sweater set. You like all this don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I mean, you don’t think it’s just like
dorky or funny or something … you really like it. Oh God! I am just so
personally horrified right now …</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I just don’t think we have the right to …</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: David, let me tell you something. These
people don’t want to be geeks. They want to be “attractive.” They’ve got
a lot of potential, they just don’t know any better.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: They don’t have that kind of potential.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Um–hello? You want to like take a
look?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Wow. What kind of gum is that?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I gotta go. I’m meeting Biff at the
flagpole.</p>
<p><strong>dr. henderson</strong>: Let me see it again.</p>
<p><strong>dr. henderson</strong>: Well … I don’t think it’s anything to
worry about … It’ll probably just clear up by itself. Cut down on greasy
foods and chocolate. No french fries, that kind of thing. It’s just a
“teenage” thing.</p>
<p><strong>lil richard</strong>: “… Got a gal–her name is Sue. She knows
just what to do …”</p>
<p><strong>lil richard</strong>: “… A wop bop a loo bop–a wop bam
boom!”</p>
<p><strong>the room</strong>: The JUKE BOX … The COKE SIGN .. THE
NAUGAHIDE STOOLS … David crosses to one of the booths where his sister’s
arm is draped over Biff’s shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What’ll it be?</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: Gee whizz, Bud. Guess I’ll just have the
usual. Cheeseburger and a cherry coke.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Me too. Sounds swell.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Really? It seems so fattening.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Two cheeseburgers, two cherry cokes.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: There aren’t any cheeseburgers.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Look. I thought we talked about this, I
thought we said …</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: Oh–what’s the point, Bud?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: C’mere.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: Well … I’m not sure I see the point
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What are you talking about! You make
hamburgers! That is the point!</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: No I know … I know I do … But it’s
always the same, you know? Grill the bun, flip the meat, melt the cheese
… It never changes. It never gets any better or worse …</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Just listen to me …</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: … Like the other night, when I closed
up by myself. That was different …</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Forget about that!</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: Oh … Okay. … But I really liked it.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Look, you can’t always like what you do.
Sometimes you just do it because it’s your job. And even if you don’t
like it, you just gotta do it anyway.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: So they can have their hamburgers!</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: You know what I really like?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: … What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: Christmastime.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: See every year on Dec 3, I get to paint
the Christmas decorations in the window. And every year, I get to paint
a different thing … One year it’s the North Pole. The next I do Santa’s
workshop. Here I’ll show you.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Wow … That’s pretty good …</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: Thanks. But this morning I was thinking
about it and I realized that I looked forward to it all year. And then I
thought “Gee. That seems awfully silly. That seems like an awfully long
time to be waiting for just one moment, don’t you think?”</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: Well don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I think you should try not to think about
this anymore.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: Oh. Okay. I’ll try that then.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Have they ever lost before?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Basketball? No they sure haven’t.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Just feels “wrong”, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>third patron</strong>: Maybe that’s where they get that
saying, “can’t win ’em all.”</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Yeah. That’s a good point, Ralph. They do have
that saying.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: But they do win ’em all, Gus. They’ve always
won ’em all.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Well, yeah. That’s true too.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: … He said it would clear up on its own if she
just stayed away from fried foods and sweets …</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Well that makes sense.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Except it’s spread to her lips now too. Oh, I
don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: And you say it’s just “red?”</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Well–like red, only … “redder.”</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Hunh. I know what you mean. That’s like the
front of Bill Johnson’s shop. I was going by it the other day and it
looked green only “greener.”</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Have you seen him lately? The man doesn’t
look like himself. I was getting my sewing machine fixed across the
street and he was sitting in the window of his shop just staring. Wasn’t
looking at anything in particular–just staring off into space.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: That is strange.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Betty, it’s your bid.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Uh … Seven hearts.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Mary Sue?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Can I ask you a question?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: What goes on up at Lover’s Lane?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Well, you hear all these things lately. You
know–kids spending so much time up there … Is it holding hands? That
kind of thing?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Yeah … That–and …</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: It doesn’t matter.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: No. I want to know.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: … Sex.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Ah.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: What’s sex?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: You sure you want to know this?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: You see Mom … When two people like each
other very much …</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Yes … It’s just that …</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Well … … Your father would never do anything
like that.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Oh. Hmm … Well, Mom … there’s ways to
“enjoy” yourself without Dad.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Sweetie? You coming to bed?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Betty?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Yeah … I’m just going to take a bath
first.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Oh my God!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Jesus Christ …</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Right here!</p>
<p><strong>fire chief</strong>: Where is it?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Here! Grab this nozzle.</p>
<p><strong>fireman</strong>: But where’s the …</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Just grab it!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Okay! Now point this right at the flames–like
this.</p>
<p><strong>fireman</strong>: Whoa! So that’s what these do.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: … In honor and in recognition of your heroism
…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: … And with great appreciation from the citizens
of Pleasantville …</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I am pleased to present You with this special
commendation, from the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce!</p>
<p><strong>girl’s voice</strong>: Hi Bud …</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: That was sure swell …</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Oh. Thanks, Margaret.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I baked you my oatmeal cookies.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Oh, no … You baked those for Whitey.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: No. I baked them for you.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: No. You baked them for Whitey.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: No. I baked them for you.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Um … thanks.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: See ya.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I had nothing to do with that fire.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Not directly anyhow …</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Um … They like wanna ask you a question …
I didn’t know how to handle it. So …</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: How you doin?</p>
<p><strong>various kids</strong>: Swell …</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: How’d you know about the fire?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: How’d you know how to put it out and all?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Well–where I used to live … That’s just what
firemen did.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: And where’s that?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Um … Outside of Pleasantville.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: What’s outside of Pleasantville?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Look it doesn’t matter. It’s not
important.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It’s really not important.</p>
<p><strong>girl’s voice</strong>: What’s outside of Pleasantville?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: C’mon. Tell us …</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Well … There are some places where the road
doesn’t go in a circle. There are some places where it keeps on
going.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Keeps going …</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Well–it all just keeps going. Roads … rivers
…</p>
<p><strong>2nd boy</strong>: Like the “Mighty Mississippi”.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: … What?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: “It was big ‘n brown ’n kept goin’ an’ goin’ as
far you could see.”</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I thought the books were blank?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: They were.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Okay look, this like–wasn’t my fault. They
asked me what it was about and I like didn’t remember ’cause we had it
back in tenth grade, But I told them what I DID remember, and the next
thing I knew the pages had filled in.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: The pages filled in?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: But like only up to the part about the
raft, because I didn’t read any farther.</p>
<p><strong>2nd boy</strong>: Do you know how it ends?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Well, yeah … I do.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: So how does it end?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Well–see … they’re both running away–Huck and
the slave … And … They go up the river … But–in trying to get free they
sort of see that they’re free already.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Oh my God.</p>
<p><strong>2nd boy</strong>: Wow!</p>
<p><strong>3rd boy</strong>: Do you know this one?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Hunh? Oh yeah … Well this is great.
See–Holden Caulfield is like this really lonely kid…</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: I don’t know Phil. It’s pretty strange.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I’ll say it’s strange. Gettin’ stranger.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I mean goin’ up to that lake all the time is
one thing, but now they’re going to a library! I mean what’s next?</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: Oughtta be havin’ an ice cream soda. That’s
where they oughtta be.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Want some bridge mix?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Oh, no thanks …</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Betty’s making some pineapple kabobs …</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I’m fine–but thank you.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: George, you’re probably wondering why I asked
if I could come over today …</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I’m sure you’ve noticed the same things we all
have–certain “changes” going on in the town. You know what I mean by
“changes”?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: “Changes.”</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: “Changes.” And it’s not just the fire or big
stuff like that. It’s little things. Did you hear about Bill Miller?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No. What?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Wife wants him to get one of those new
beds.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: One of those … big beds?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh my gosh. What’s he gonna to do?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I really don’t know. Ben Miller’s son just quit
his job as a boxboy at the market.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: … How?</p>
<p><strong>big bob</strong>: Said he didn’t want to do it anymore. Just
took off his apron in the middle of an order. Mrs. Thompson had her
groceries spread all over the counter … Took ’em four hours to sort the
whole thing out.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Holy cow.</p>
<p><strong>big bob</strong>: George, everyone likes you.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh well …</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: No. They do. And it isn’t just ’cause you’re a
great bowler … They respect you …</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: And it’s important for them to see someone they
respect, stand up for what’s right. If you love a place, you can’t sit
around and watch this kind of thing happen to it.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No. Of course not.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: And that’s why I want you to be on the
Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh my Gosh. I hardly know what to say.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Why don’t you start by saying “yes,” and then
getting me one of those swell pineapple kabobs.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh sure … You bet. Betty …</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’ll get her.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>completely to color. the eyes are green. the lips are
red.</strong>: SHE HAS A NATURAL BLUSH IN HER CHEEKS. In fact the whole
thing looks like a beautiful color portrait except for the tear stains
on either side of her face.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: What am I going to do?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It’s okay. It’s alright.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I can’t go out there. How can I go out
there?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Look at me …</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Have you got any make up?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: In my handbag.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Okay–first we’ll dry you out a little.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Does it look okay?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Looks just like it did.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: And they won’t be able to tell?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: No … They won’t be able to tell.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Wait.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: Oh, hi.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: Aren’t you a little early?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I brought you something … From the
library.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It’s an art book.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: Oh my Gosh, Bud …</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Open it.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I just thought since you liked painting it
might help to …</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: Mmmmgh …</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: It’s beautiful, Bud …</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: I’ll never be able to do that.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Oh, well–you’re just starting out. I mean,
you can’t do it …</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: No, that’s not it.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: Where am I going to see colors like
that?</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: Must be awfully lucky to see colors
like that. I bet they don’t even know how lucky they are.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Oh … Hi.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Look, I probably shouldn’t be asking you
this–not knowing you that well and all …</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It’s just that my folks are gonna stay home
and they said I could use their car. … You want to go out with me
tonight?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Sure … Where would we go?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: … Lover’s Lane?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Sorry …</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: “Oh when the Saints … Go Marching in …”</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Bud …</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: David …</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: Hello there.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: … Hi.</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: Well c’mere, young fella.</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: You know I’ve been thinkin’ … I might
have been a little “hasty” the other day when you asked to come
home–just took me by such surprise, ya know–ha ha …</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: So even though I can’t make any
promises, well–I figured if you asked me real nice–I might just be
willing to talk about it again.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Talk about it. Right now, I mean. I got to …
um …</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: Bud–I thought you wanted to come
home.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Oh … I do. Yeah. It’s just that I told my
“dad” I’d clean out the rain gutters and Mr. Johnson wanted me to … to
change the tape in the register …</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: I’ll be honest with you Bud. I’m
getting sorta concerned about what I’m seeing in some of these re-runs
…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Re-runs?</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: Like when Margaret Henderson makes
her cookies for Whitey. … Those aren’t your cookies Bud.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Oh, I know they’re not. But I mean– they’re
just “cookies” after all …</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Well they’re not just cookies. I mean,
they’re great cookies … Look, I’d love to get into this whole thing but
I’m really running late. Why don’t we hook up tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Terrific. I’ll talk to you then.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Nothing?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Listen …</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You’re reading?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Yeah. Can’t believe you started such a
dorky fad.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: D.H. Lawrence. You ever heard of him?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: … Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Seemed kinda sexy. Look. I read 35
pages.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: That’s great.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: So what is it?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Well … I just … Can I ask you a question?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Remember when you told me that Lisa Rosenberg
liked me?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Yeah …</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Well–did she really like me or were you just
making that up.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: No. She really liked you.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You weren’t playing a joke? She woulda gone
out with me?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Gone out with you. She woulda like
rearranged your tonsils.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Can I ask you a question?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: How come I’m still in black and white?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Well I’ve had like ten times as much sex
as these girls and I’m still like this. They have one hour in the back
of a car and suddenly they’re in technicolor.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Oh, I don’t know. Maybe … … it’s not just the
sex …</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: No, it’s not just the sex, is it?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Um … You gotta turn off Main Street.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Oh … Right.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p><strong>sam cooke</strong>: “Cupid, draw back your bow …”</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What’s that smell?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Aren’t these great?</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: We’re closed right now …</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: Oh, hi …</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I’m sorry …</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: No, no … Come on in.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I just thought … It’s beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: I was just trying to do one of these
“still lifes.”</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: Having kind of a tough time.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I think it looks nice.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: Well … Here’s what it’s s’posed to look
like.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Oh my …</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: Here. Look at this.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Where’d you get this?</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: Bud brought it to me.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Bud?</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: Here’s my favorite.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: Isn’t it great how she’s resting like
that?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: She’s crying.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: She’s crying.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: No she’s not.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Yes she is.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: Wait …</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I’ve got to go …</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: It’s alright.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: It’s alright. Let me see.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: No …</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: It’s beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: … It’s beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: You shouldn’t cover that up.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Hunh.</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: Mary Sue–C’mon …</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: It’s six-thirty …</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: So.</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: We were gonna … You know …</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Oh. I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I’m busy.</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: With what?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I’m studying.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Mmmmgh.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Do they have those … Where you come
from?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Yeah … I guess. I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: You don’t know?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: So what’s it like?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Out there.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Oh. don’t know … It’s different.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Well it’s louder … And scarier I guess … And
… and a lot more dangerous …</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Sounds fantastic. You know some kids came
up here the other night to go swimming–took off all their clothes.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Do they have an Ocean? I’ve heard about
the ocean.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: What’s that like?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Well it’s big. And it’s blue … … It’s really
really blue.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Mmmm. Boy. It’s hot up here.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: You want some berries?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Hunh?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I picked them myself. They grow wild up
here. Mmm. So sweet.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: They just grow like that?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Oh yeah. There’s a lot of stuff. Currants
and strawberries … Here. I’ll show you.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Go on. Try it.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Honey–I’m home.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Honey–I’m home …</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: What is that?</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: What is that?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Rain.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Real rain?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Yeah … You don’t have rain either?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Right. Of course you don’t …</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: What do we do?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: We’ll just put up the top.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: What top?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It’s fine. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It’s alright. There’s nothing to be afraid
of.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Cool …</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Honey, I’m home …</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Where’s my dinner?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Where’s my dinner …</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Where’s my DINNER …</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Where’s my DINNER!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Where’s my dinner?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Are you alright? What is it?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Rain.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Real rain?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Oh my God …</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: … We had no idea. Burt was rolling a 250 and …
Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, I … I came home like I always do, And
I came in the front door. And I took off my coat. And I put down my
briefcase and I said “Honey. I’m home.”</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: … Only no one was there.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: So I went into the kitchen and I yelled it
again. “Honey–I’m home.” But there was no one there either. No wife. No
lights. No dinner.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: So I went to the oven–you know– because I
thought maybe she had made me one of those “TV dinners …”</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: But she hadn’t. She was gone.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: … It’s gonna be fine George.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: What do we do Bob?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Well–we’ll be safe for now–thank goodness we’re
in a bowling alley– but if George here doesn’t get his dinner, any one
of us could be next. It could be you Gus, or you Burt, or even you Phil
…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: … That’s real rain out there gentlemen. This
isn’t some little “virus” that’s going to “clear up on it’s own.”
There’s something happening to our town and I think we can all see where
it comes from.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: We’re gonna need a town meeting. Phil, how fast
can you turn around a leaflet in your print shop?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Couple of hours.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Gus, why don’t you get a bunch of kids from the
basketball team to help you put them up on lamposts and tree trunks
…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: And the first thing you’re gonna do is get a
cup of hot cocoa and a nice dry bowling shirt.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: You can’t go out there.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: But I really should get home.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: But you can’t go out there.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Sounds nice … Once you get used to it.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: Yeah. It does.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Like a drum.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: Yeah. Or like sprinklers in the summer
…</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: Oh my Gosh …</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Oh my God …</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Oh my God …</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Oh my GOD!</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I told you where I was.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: All night?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I got caught in the storm. You were gone all
night too.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I was in a bowling-alley.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Look. Let’s just forget about it. Let’s just
go to the meeting and …</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I told you, George. I’m not going.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Sure you are.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: No I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Look at me George. That meeting’s not for me.
Look at my face.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: It’s fine. You’ll put on some make up and
…</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I don’t want to put on some make up …</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: It goes away … It’ll go away.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I don’t want it to go away.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Okay–now you listen to me … You’re gonna
come to this meeting and you’re gonna put on this make up, and you’re
gonna come home at six o’clock every night and have dinner ready on this
table.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: No I’m not sweetie.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: … There’s a meatloaf in the fridge. You just
put it in the oven and turn this little knob up to three-fifty. If you
put the pie in forty minutes later, it’ll be hot in time for
dessert.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I made a couple of lunches for you and put
them in brown paper bags … I’m gonna go now.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Where are you gonna go?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I’m gonna go now.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Betty, don’t go out there like that! They’ll
see you! They’ll SEE you!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Betty, come back here!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: This was found over in Dave Murphy’s trash can.
There were four of them like this …</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Jane Davidson found these in her son’s laundry
basket.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: This is from Mary Petersen’s front porch. She
found one last week. There were two more this morning …</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I got you something.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: It’s beautiful. Where’d you get it?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It was a prop for the school play …</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Can I open it?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Sure …</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Hello Bud …</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Hello Whitey.</p>
<p><strong>whitey</strong>: Hello Margaret.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Hello Whitey …</p>
<p><strong>whitey</strong>: Hey Bud, how come you’re not at the town
meeting right now?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: No reason. How come you’re not?</p>
<p><strong>whitey</strong>: Oh. We’re s’posed to go out and let
everybody know about it. See.</p>
<p><strong>whitey</strong>: No reason hunh … See I thought maybe it was
cause you were too busy entertaining your colored girlfriend.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Why don’t you guys just get the hell out of
here.</p>
<p><strong>whitey</strong>: Oh, okay, Bud. We’ll do that.</p>
<p><strong>whitey</strong>: You know Margaret, you can come over and
bake those Oatmeal cookies for me anytime you want to.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It’s fine … It doesn’t mean anything.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Ed McFadden’s got a blue front door.</p>
<p><strong>ed mcfadden</strong>: It’s always been blue!</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Not that blue!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: There’s a big tree turning orange in Joe
Baker’s front yard!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: People, people … I think we all know what’s
going on here.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Obviously certain “changes” have been
happening. Up until now, things in Pleasantville have always been– well
… “Pleasant.” And, recently, certain things have become … “Un-Pleasant.”
Now it seems to me the first thing we have to do is to separate out the
things that are pleasant, from the things that are “Un-Pleasant.”</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: George, why don’t you and Burt take the lead on
this. Why don’t you put together kind of an “Un-Pleasant” Activities
Committee …</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: Bud …</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: I want a word with you …</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Oh–well …</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: What the hell do you think you’re
doing!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: What do I MEAN! You think this is a
toy? You think it’s your own little goddamn coloring book …</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Look–it just sort of “happened” …</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: A deluge doesn’t just “happen.” Bolts
of lightning don’t just “happen” … You burned down an ELM tree for
Christ’s sake …</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I had nothing to do with that.</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: Oh. I’m sorry–refresh my memory. What
episode does the orgy happen in, again?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Look …</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: It was a gift Bud. It was so special.
You liked these things as much as I did, remember: Warm smells in the
family kitchen? A smile from a stranger? You know how rare that is?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: … Only if they mean it.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I didn’t do anything wrong.</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: Oh no? Let me show you something!</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: Where’s the remote control I gave
you?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: Because you’re coming home. I’m gonna
put this place back the way it was.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: No you’re not.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’m sorry … I can’t let you do that.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’m going to leave now.</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: You’re not going anywhere. You’re
gonna get that remote and you’re gonna come home and we’re gonna make
everybody HAPPY AGAIN!!!</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: Don’t make me get rough with you! I
can get awfully fucking rough!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Come on!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Get out of here!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Oh my God.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Are you alright? Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: No. Let’s get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: We should be okay up here.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: We better go.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Where are they?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’m not sure.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Oh my God.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Don’t! Just let go.</p>
<p><strong>biff</strong>: It’s better, Mary Sue.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I said, NO! … I’ve read like one book in
my whole life and I’ll be damned if I let you throw it on that fire
…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It’s okay. It’s me.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Let’s go inside.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: Just thought I’d try to tidy it up a
bit.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: It’s okay. Once we sweep it up it’ll be
alright again …</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Well he’s right. Come on. Let’s turn these
booths back up. “Mary Sue”, why don’t you help me slide this in front of
the door. We’ll be okay in here.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: This is not the answer people.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: No matter how upset we may get, or how
frustrated we may be, we’re not gonna solve our problems out in the
street. It’s just the wrong way to do it. We have to have a “Code of
Conduct” we can all agree to live by.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Now, I asked George and Burt here to sketch out
some ideas-and I think they’ve done a terrific job. If we all agree on
these then we can take a vote and I think we’ll start to move in the
right direction.</p>
<p>****: “ONE: All public disruption and acts of vandalism are to cease
immediately.”</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: “TWO: All citizens of Pleasantville are to
treat one another in a courteous and”pleasant” manner …”</p>
<p><strong>lisa anne</strong>: “Courteous and Pleasant manner.” That
doesn’t sound too bad.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: “THREE: The area commonly known as Lover’s
Lane as well as the Pleasantville Public Library shall be closed until
further notice.”</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: “FOUR: The only permissible recorded music
shall be the following: Pat Boone, Johnny Mathis, Perry Como, Jack
Jones, The marches of John Phillips Souza or the Star Spangled Banner.
In no event shall any music be tolerated that is not of a temperate
or”pleasant” nature.”</p>
<p><strong>various kids</strong>: “Oh my gosh … No …”</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: “FIVE: There shall be no public sale of
umbrellas or preparation for inclement weather of any kind.”</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: “SIX: No bedframe or mattress may be sold
measuring more than 38 inches wide.”</p>
<p><strong>“seven</strong>: The only permissible exterior paint colors
shall be BLACK, WHITE or GRAY, despite the recent availability of
certain alternatives.”</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: “EIGHT: All elementary and high school
curriculums shall teach the”non-changist” view of history– emphasizing
“continuity” over “alteration.” Wow.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Hey. This thing works.</p>
<p><strong>buddy holly</strong>: Well all the things that you say and do
Make me want to be with you-oo-oo …</p>
<p><strong>lisa anne</strong>: Turn that off!</p>
<p><strong>lisa anne</strong>: You’re not allowed to do that now!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Sure you are.</p>
<p><strong>buddy holly</strong>: The little things that you say and do
Make we want to be with you-oo-oo … RAVE ON! It’s a crazy feeling … RAVE
ON! It’s got me reelin’ …</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Stick together till you get off Main
Street.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It’s okay. We’ll get you a new one.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: I don’t know what I’d do if I couldn’t
paint anymore Bud. I just don’t know what I’d do …</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Maybe I have an idea.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Did you do this?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Yes I did.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Do you know that it’s illegal?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Yes I do.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Because anybody should be able to paint in
whatever color they want.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You’re not allowed to do this! I could arrest
you for this.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Still doesn’t make it right.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Dan! Arrest them!</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Um … I don’t know how to do that, Bob.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What do you mean!?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Well, I never had to do it before.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You put handcuffs on them and you take them to
the police station.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Oh. guess I could do that, then.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: C’mere, Dan. I’ll help you.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: There’s someone to see you Bud.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I thought it might be you.</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: Hope you’re proud of yourself.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I am actually … Glad to see you’ve finally
shown your true colors.</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: Okay, let’s cut the shit and get
right to it. Where’s that remote control?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: Because you’re coming home.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Why don’t you just take me back without
it?</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: Oh. You’re a smart little bastard
aren’t you? It’s kind of like a restricted ticket. You gotta leave the
same way you came.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: So … I guess as long as I’m here, all sorts
of things could happen to this place. We could have pink lawns and blue
trees …</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: Just gimme the damn remote!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’m sorry. I can’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: I don’t know what went wrong. You
answered every question. You knew every detail. The senior Prom …
McIntire’s Department Store. We had all the same warm memories: Sock
hops. The Church Social …</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: They weren’t my memories. I borrowed them.
It’s no good when you borrow them.</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: How long do you think you’ve been
here?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I don’t know … Three, four weeks.</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: Much less than that. An hour and a
half.</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: See–and this is really great– the
show was on for what–half an hour a week? So that means for every week
that goes by in Pleasantville, only half an hour goes by in the real
world.</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: Now Buddy, you’re going on trial
tomorrow. And if they find you guilty, you’re gonna be stuck here
forever. Well, not forever–lemme think … Five year sentence … Carry the
three … That comes out to … sixteen and a half centuries, and that’s
rounding down.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’m going on trial tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: This is TV pal. They don’t fool
around.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: There’s worse places.</p>
<p><strong>dick van dyke</strong>: Oh sure. For the first hundred years.
Then it starts to get a little monotonous. Sleep well.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Bud Parker and William Johnson, you have been
charged with desecration of a public building and the intentional use of
prohibited paint colors in violation of the Pleasantville Code of
Conduct and laws of common decency. Do you admit that on the night of
May 1, you did consciously and willfully apply the following FORBIDDEN
colors to the Pleasantville Town Hall: Red, Pink, Vermillion, Puce,
Chartreuse, Umber, Blue, Aqua, Ox Blood, Green, Peach, Crimson, Yellow,
Olive and Magenta.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Um … Yes I do. Where’s our lawyer?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: We prefer to keep these proceedings as
“pleasant” as possible. I don’t think a lawyer will be necessary.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Do you further admit that this was done
surreptitiously and under the cover of darkness?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Well–it was dark out …</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Good. Do you further admit that this unnatural
depiction occurred in full public view where it was accessible to, and
in plain sight of, minor children?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It was accessible to everyone.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Very well. Let the record show that the
defendants have answered in the affirmative to all the charges.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Do you have anything to say in your
defense?</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: I didn`t mean to hurt anybody. I just
have to paint … I need to.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I think I’ve got something to say.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Very well …</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I think I know why you’re doing this. I mean,
I understand why you’re doing this. I used to feel the same way. I used
to want this place to stay just the way it was. I never wanted it to
change …</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: But nothing stays the same. You get things,
and you lose things, and that’s the good part and the bad part–but you
can’t have a good part without a bad part.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It’s like the basketball team.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: The basketball team?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Sure. Everybody’s upset because they’re not
winning anymore–but just think how it would feel if all of a sudden they
do win.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Wouldn’t it feel better than when they used
to win all the time?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: See, I know you want it to stay “Pleasant”
but there are so many things that are so much better: like Silly … or
Sexy … or Dangerous … or Wild … or Brief … And every one of those things
is in you all the time if you just have the guts to look for them. Look
at those faces back there. They’re no different than you are. They just
happened to see something inside themselves that you don’t want to …</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Okay–that’s enough!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I thought I was allowed to defend myself.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You’re not allowed to lie.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’m not lying … Here I’ll show you.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Mr. Simpson …</p>
<p><strong>mr. simpson</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What color is that hedge of yours?</p>
<p><strong>mr. simpson</strong>: Green.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: No, not that hedge. The other one.</p>
<p><strong>mr. simpson</strong>: The other one?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: The one in your mind. The one that you see on
a bright cold morning. The one that you see when you walk in front of
your house and you just stand there and stare.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What color is that hedge?</p>
<p><strong>suddenly and before our eyes, mr. simpson turns to
living</strong>: COLOR. A huge MURMUR moves through the courtroom. Bob
bangs the gavel.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I said, that’s enough!</p>
<p><strong>the audience</strong>: “No … Let him finish … Go on …”</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Alright. Dad …</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yes Bud.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Don’t you miss her?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I mean, of course you do, but it isn’t just
the cooking or the cleaning that you miss–it’s something else, isn’t it
…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Maybe you can’t even describe it. Maybe you
only know it when it’s gone. Maybe it’s like there’s a whole piece of
you that’s missing too. You might even call it “love.”</p>
<p><strong>big bob</strong>: Okay, that’s IT!!!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Now don’t you think she looks just as pretty
in color? Don’t you think she looks just as pretty as she did the day
you met her?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Don’t you wish you could tell her that?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Why am I out of order?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Well I don’t think it’s a circus. And I don’t
think they do either.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: But see that’s just the point. It can’t stop
at once. Because it’s in you. And you can’t stop something that’s in
you.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: It’s not in ME.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Oh sure it is.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: No it isn’t.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What do you want to do to me right now?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: C’mon. Everyone’s turning colors. Kids are
making out in the street. No one’s getting their dinner– hell, you could
have a flood any minute … Pretty soon you could have the women going off
to work while the men stayed home and cooked …</p>
<p><strong>big bob</strong>: That’s not going to happen!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: But it could happen.</p>
<p><strong>big bob</strong>: No it couldn’t!</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Uch … I am like gonna hurl …</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I told you. I’m like positive.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: This thing works. We could go home right
now.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I’m not ready yet. I gotta do this for a
little while.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Besides. You think there’s like a chance
I’m gonna get into college back there?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Honestly … no.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You got the admissions letter.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Right here.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: And you’re sure about this?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I’ve done the slut thing, David. It’s
really kinda old.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’ll come back and check on you in a
month.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: You’re like the coolest brother in the
world.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: You’re gonna forget about me.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: No I won’t. I swear.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I like calling you David.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I like it too.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: Well how do you know it won’t go back
to the way it was?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You’re gonna keep painting aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Well …</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: Oh. I’ve got something for you.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It’s beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnson</strong>: Just a little–You know.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I made you these for the trip. They’re
marshmallow rice squares.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Thanks. I thought you weren’t gonna …</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I had to say goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: There’s a meatloaf sandwich in there too.
Don’t go skipping dinner just ’cause you’re not here anymore.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I won’t.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: And … wear this on the trip in case it gets
cold.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: … It’s a pretty short trip.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I’m so proud of you, Bud.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Thanks … I love you.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I love you too.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Well …</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You better stand back a little.</p>
