<p><strong>ext. field - day</strong>: 1 1</p>
<p><strong>reverse angle to reveal</strong>: the children are being
watched by their parents, .</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: I received a formal request for marriage
today for Anne. From the Carey family.</p>
<p><strong>lady elizabeth</strong>: But that’s wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: I turned it down.</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: And offered them Mary instead.</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: Fnne’s too good for William Carey. She
can do</p>
<p><strong>lady elizabeth</strong>: You underestimate Mary.</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: Not true. I think she’s..the kinder of
the two. Quite possibly the fairer.</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: But to get ahead in this world, you need
more than fair looks and a kind heart.</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: Bravo! Anne!</p>
<p><strong>ext. bell tower - ten years later</strong>: 2 2</p>
<p><strong>int. mary’s bedroom - day</strong>: 3 3</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: May we come in..?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Look at you..! Younger than me. More beautiful
than me. Married before me. I am eclipsed. I am just the `Other Boleyn
Girl.’</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Hardly.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No, is this it? This is the end of the
unholy trinity?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: No, George. Never. I’ll be married, that’s
all.. Apart from that - it won’t change a thing.</p>
<p><strong>int. chapel - day</strong>: 4 4</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Confirma hoc, Deus, quod operatus es in
nobis..</p>
<p><strong>int. boleyn home - night</strong>: 5 5</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Are you happy?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Very.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: You don’t secretly wish you’d married
someone grander? With a title?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: No. I want a husband who loves me. And who
thinks it first thing every morning. And last thing at night.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Then you’ve found the right man.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Who is that? He was staring at me in
church?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: That’s Henry Percy. Heir to the Duke of
Northumberland. Richest landowner in England.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: But don’t get your hopes up. He is already
betrothed.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Betrothed is not married, brother George. A
lot can happen before you reach the altar.</p>
<p><strong>in another corner:</strong>: 6 6</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: Thomas..</p>
<p><strong>norfolk</strong>: I think I have managed to persuade the King
to come and stay with you on progress. A week-end’s hunting in late
summer.</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: But that’s wonderful! Thank you, thank
you so much.. Did you hear that, Elizabeth?</p>
<p><strong>lady elizabeth</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: Finally we can present George, and with
luck, get him a position at court.</p>
<p><strong>norfolk</strong>: These are difficult times. I have it on
good authority that the Queen no longer bleeds - yet the matter of a
male heir is still not resolved. It cannot be long before the King is
forced to look outside the marriage.</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: What? And make a bastard King of
England?</p>
<p><strong>norfolk</strong>: A legitimized bastard. What choice does he
have? Obviously, I’ve given it thought, and wondered which Howard girl I
could put under his nose. Imagine the influence that would give us. To
be blood family of the next King of England. Equally, imagine if another
family were to achieve the same?</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: What about Anne?</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: I realise as a
<code>Boleyn' she is not officially a</code>Howard’, but as your
sister’s daughter..</p>
<p><strong>norfolk</strong>: But she’s your eldest, Thomas. Your first
born. And your favourite. Wouldn’t you prefer her to have a nice,
uncomplicated, respectable marriage? Like Mary?</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: If Anne were an uncomplicated,
respectable girl like Mary, then I’d say `yes’. But she’s not.</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: She’s anything but.</p>
<p><strong>int. boleyn castle - day</strong>: 7 7</p>
<p><strong>ady elizabeth</strong>: don’t like it. It would cost a
fortune</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: And what if you were to look on the
bright side? Just once?</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: Risk nothing, you gain nothing.</p>
<p><strong>lady elizabeth</strong>: hen was it that people stopped
thinking of ambition as a sin, and started thinking of it as a
virtue?</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: Easy for you to say. You’ve had power
and wealth all your life.</p>
<p><strong>lady elizabeth</strong>: Until I married you, Thomas. And I
was happy to give it up.</p>
<p><strong>int. corridor - night</strong>: 8 8</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: You asked to see me father?</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: Yes. Come in.</p>
<p><strong>int. hever castle - night</strong>: 9 9</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: o - the King himself is coming to Hever. I’m
so happy for George.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Yes. But Father took me aside. It seems he has
ambitions for me, too.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What? What are you saying..?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: It’s known the King has a wandering eye.
Imagine…if he were to like me?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: But…you could never be more than his mistress.
And that’s no substitute for a husband.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: But as the King’s mistress the least I’d get
after he finished with me would be an Earl. And if I fell pregnant? And
gave him what his wife has failed to? Quite apart from the money, it’d
be a Duke at least.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: But what about your happiness? Your
future?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I could be a happy Duchess.</p>
<p><strong>int. bedrooom - night</strong>: 0 10</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Are you nervous?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: A little.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: You’ll tell me everything in the morning?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I promise.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: No details spared?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Hold me a moment?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: I am the luckiest man in the world.</p>
<p><strong>ext. english countryside - day</strong>: 11 11</p>
<p><strong>ext. hever - day</strong>: 2 12</p>
<p><strong>ext. hever - estate - day</strong>: 13 13</p>
<p><strong>int. hever - day</strong>: 14 14</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: There he is!</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: You think he will like me?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Of course, sister. How could he not?</p>
<p><strong>ext. hever - day</strong>: 15 15</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: Your Majesty, you are most welcome.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Sir Thomas. Lady Elizabeth..</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: May I present my son, George.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Your Uncle tells me I should have you at
court. Should I?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: It would be a great honour, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: And our daughter, Anne.</p>
<p><strong>enry</strong>: No one said anything of a daughter.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Had we known, we might have come sooner.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Your Majesty..</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: Perhaps you’ll allow Anne to show you
around our modest house?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: A pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>ext/int. hever - day</strong>: 16 16</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Here is the library.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Charming.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: And through here, the observatory..</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Lovely..</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: falcon, your Grace.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I can see that. But what’s it doing there?
More to the point.. ..not just there, but in every corner in the
house?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I have no idea. Ask my father. Perhaps because
falcons are vaguely associative with field sports - field sports with
aristocracy - and in the absence of a genuine coat of arms.. …a man with
ambition will do the strangest things.</p>
<p><strong>enry</strong>: That’s a sharp tongue you have. I wonder what
it might say about me behind my back?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Oh, his Majesty has nothing to fear from me.
Unless he fears an excess of compliments.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Really? And what would they be..?</p>
<p><strong>int. boleyn house - evening</strong>: 17 17</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: Bravo, Anne! The King was quite smitten!
Told me so himself. And has requested you sit beside him at dinner.</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: My girl. My dear, remarkable girl. I
knew you would up to the task.</p>
<p><strong>int. boleyn home - night</strong>: 18 18</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Well played! And, may I say.. ..an excellent
choice of music too!</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Sir Thomas, Lady Elizabeth, dear Anne. Your
health.</p>
<p><strong>h</strong>: ENRY raises his glass. Cheers and applause from
the COURTIERS. A beaming SIR THOMAS raises his glass.</p>
<p><strong>later</strong>: dinner is served. Everyone is eating. HENRY
and several close COURTIERS are engaged in debate..</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: ..I had it from the lips of the Spanish
ambassador himself. That our musicians are the envy of all Europe.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: ..then he was flattering you, your
Grace.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Our Universities and philosophers, too.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: …another lie. That honour would have to go
to the Germans.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: What of our painters, then?</p>
<p><strong>randon</strong>: Years behind their Italian counterparts. The
truth is far from leading the world, we’re a provincial outpost, lagging
far behind.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: What? Is no one proud to be English? Anne?
What say you?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Me, my Lord? I know little of such matters,
but I’ve not heard mention of our armies. Undefeated, I believe, in a
generation.</p>
<p><strong>enry</strong>: Well said.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Or our navy? The finest in the world.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: It’s true.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: The universities in Spain and the philosophers
in Germany may be strong, but are they really the equal of Oxford and
Thomas More?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Never!</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I doubt there is a country that is fairer in
Government, or better protected by nature from her enemies, whose people
are happier or more prosperous..</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: She’s right, by God! She’s right!</p>
<p><strong>int. staircase - boleyn house - night</strong>: 19 19</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: You did well tonight. Very well. Quite
enough to be invited to court, I am sure of it.</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: Now go to bed. Get a good night’s sleep.
Because there’s still the hunt tomorrow. You must excel at that.</p>
<p><strong>int. girls’ bedroom - night</strong>: 20 20</p>
<p><strong>f</strong>: inally, ANNE comes out. The KING turns..</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Good morning, Anne.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Good morning, your Grace.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: ho will you be riding with?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: On my own your Grace.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Your own..?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: They have invented a new saddle which allows
ladies to ride on their own.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: ut with no man to hold onto? How will you
stay on the horse?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Why? The same way you hold onto yours, your
Grace.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: We’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Let’s away!</p>
<p><strong>ext. countryside - day</strong>: 22 22</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Hah!</p>
<p><strong>ext. fields - day</strong>: 3 23</p>
<p><strong>ext. fields - day</strong>: 24 24</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Hah..!</p>
<p><strong>ext. fields - day</strong>: 25 25</p>
<p><strong>ider</strong>: We’ve lost him. He’s in the forest.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Then we must follow.</p>
<p><strong>int. forest - day</strong>: 26 26</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Hah!</p>
<p><strong>ext. forest - ravine - day</strong>: 7 27</p>
<p><strong>enry</strong>: he King of England defeated by a humble
fawn.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Hah!</p>
<p><strong>courtier</strong>: Please, your Majesty. It’s not safe.</p>
<p><strong>t</strong>: the mud, it’s hooves grasping horrifically at
air..</p>
<p><strong>int. hever - night</strong>: 8 28</p>
<p><strong>physician</strong>: It’s a miracle, Majesty, you have no
broken bones..</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: My daughter Anne is here. Would like to
apologise.</p>
<p><strong>enry</strong>: No! Get her away from me!</p>
<p><strong>later</strong>: HENRY’s wound is being dressed by MARY.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: And who are you?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Mary, your Grace. Anne’s younger sister.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: You’ve been here all week-end?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Yes, your Grace.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Really? How could I have overlooked you?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Next to Anne, it’s easy to do.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Nonsense.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Yes, your Grace. To William Carey.</p>
<p><strong>enry</strong>: From Wolsey’s office?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Yes, your Grace.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Then why haven’t I seen you at court?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Because I have persuaded him to spend a year
or two here first. We have a small manor and some land. Nothing much.
But enough to start a family.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: A charmed life in the country? Away from it
all?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Everything I would have wished for myself.
But then my brother died. And duty called.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: You don’t think he’ll miss court? A young,
ambitious man?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: He says not, your Majesty.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: But, if he ever changed his mind, I would
always support him.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Well said.</p>
<p><strong>ext. hever castle - day</strong>: 29 29</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Thank you again, Lady Elizabeth. We’ll take
good care of your boy.. And Thomas..</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: You’ll take care of that matter?</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: Consider it done, your Majesty.</p>
<p><strong>int. hever castle - day</strong>: 30 30</p>
<p><strong>stafford</strong>: Your Father wishes to see you.</p>
<p><strong>stafford</strong>: Just Mary.</p>
<p><strong>int. sir thomas’s study - day</strong>: 31 31</p>
<p><strong>norfolk</strong>: Mary, I don’t know what you said or did -
but you obviously made a deep impression on the King.</p>
<p>****: And he has requested you come to court with immediate
effect.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: What?!?</p>
<p><strong>int. sir thomas’s study - same time</strong>: 33 33</p>
<p><strong>norfolk</strong>: ou’re to pack and leave first thing in the
morning.</p>
<p><strong>norfolk</strong>: The King himself has secured you a position
in the Queen’s household.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: ut I don’t want to go to court. Nor does my
husband.</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: ell her.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: The King has also offered me a position. As
Gentleman of the Privy Council.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: Y’hear that? Gentleman of the Privy
Council! Attending to the private and personal needs of his Majesty
himself! That’s the inner sanctum!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: But what about our future? Here in the
country?</p>
<p><strong>norfolk</strong>: Put it out of your mind. From now on your
home is at court.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: William, please! Don’t you understand what
this means?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: They will separate us. Put me in different
accommodation. Where the King can always…find me.</p>
<p><strong>norfolk</strong>: Happily your husband understands the value
of such an opportunity. For us all.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What about Anne? Couldn’t she go instead?</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: The way that girl behaved this week-end,
she can count herself lucky she still has a home.</p>
<p><strong>int. corridor - same time</strong>: 34 34</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: also running down her cheeks. She stares at her
husband..</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: How could he DO this to me? My own father.
What if we just refused?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: We would be cut off. He made that
clear.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: But would that be so bad?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Position means nothing to me. Nor wealth. We
could find somewhere. A small farm. Away from everything.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: You say that now - but when you’re older?
And our children are grown up? This won’t last long. A year. Maybe two.
And at the end of that - we’ll we have everything we want. It’s for our
FUTURE.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: ut can’t you see? Do this, and we might not
HAVE a future.</p>
<p><strong>ext. boleyn home - stables - day</strong>: 36 36</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’m so sorry..</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: What for? You think I want the King? Or to be
used and abused by him? No! You’re welcome to him. I have my own plans,
which don’t involve becoming a rag that will one day be discarded.</p>
<p><strong>ext. palace - day</strong>: 7 37</p>
<p><strong>int. court - day</strong>: 38 38</p>
<p><strong>servant</strong>: Mary Carey, Ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>queen katherine</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>servant</strong>: The new Lady in Waiting.</p>
<p><strong>queen katherine</strong>: Really? But I was not expecting
anyone.</p>
<p><strong>ervant</strong>: Appointed by…his Majesty the King.</p>
<p><strong>queen katherine</strong>: By my husband? Really?</p>
<p><strong>queen katherine</strong>: Well, then she must be some kind of
gift. He must have seen in her some special talent that would please me.
Tell me. What special talent is it that you have? Apart from your
obvious youth and beauty?</p>
<p><strong>t</strong>: errified, MARY stammers..</p>
<p><strong>queen katherine</strong>: oetry, perhaps?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: N-no..</p>
<p><strong>queen katherine</strong>: Or dressmaking?</p>
<p><strong>queen katherine</strong>: Music! That’s it! You compose? Or
sing?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: ..I’m afraid not. Your Majesty.</p>
<p><strong>queen katherine</strong>: Come, you’re too modest. Signor
Vasquez.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: No..really..I beg you, your Majesty.</p>
<p><strong>queen katherine</strong>: I command you to SING!!!</p>
<p><strong>queen katherine</strong>: Bravo! A nightingale! Welcome at
court!</p>
<p><strong>int. corridors - whitehall palace - afternoon</strong>: 39
39</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: ait! Mary! Stop!</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I know that must have been agony, but put
yourself in her shoes. She knows the only reason the King has asked you
here is because he desires you. For a wife that must be very difficult.
She’s a good woman. Trust me.</p>
<p><strong>j</strong>: ANE</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Mary Carey.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: You have a brother, don’t you? George?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I’ve seen him a few times at court. And like
him…very well. But I don’t think he has noticed me.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I can’t imagine. Should I mention you to
him?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Would you?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Of course. Happily.</p>

<p><strong>george</strong>: Not noticed her? Jane Parker? Of course I
have. How could I not? She looks like a goat.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Well, she likes you, and asked me to give you
this..to remember her by.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Ugh. Well say you haven’t seen me. Or that
you forgot.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: And our sister? Any word?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: ANNE? You know she took being upstaged by
you very badly.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Yes, I know.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: And no amount of interventions on my behalf
would make her believe you hadn’t done it intentionally.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: But you KNOW I would never do anything like
that.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>int. mary’s room - court - day</strong>: 41 41</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Please, don’t be alarmed.</p>
<p><strong>enry</strong>: I wanted to find somewhere we could be alone
so I might say a few words to you in person.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I hope your accommodation is comfortable. I
realise it’s no substitute for the life you had in mind in the country..
But please, give me the opportunity to try to make you happy here..</p>
<p><strong>he</strong>: The moment I met you, I realised I..</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: What are you..?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I am sorry. You obviously misunderstand
me.</p>
<p><strong>int. norfolk’s study - court - night</strong>: 42 42</p>
<p><strong>norfolk</strong>: What? If all the King wanted was coition,
he could fetch in a woman from the bath house. What he wants is YOU. To
woo you. And be wooed in return. And could’nt you look just a little
happier? There isn’t a girl in the Kingdom that wouldn’t wish to be in
your shoes.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Your opinion, Uncle.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Mine is that it’s the greatest insult of
all.</p>
<p><strong>orfolk</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Asking a whore to have feelings, too.</p>

<p><strong>george</strong>: he’s married Henry Percy!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: In secret. Without telling anyone!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Oh, no…!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You don’t look pleased.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Why would I be pleased?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: It would make her the future Duchess of
Northumberland. Our sister!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: But they’ll never allow it, don’t you see?
He’s already precontracted to Mary Talbot, and if word of the
consummation gets out her reputation will be ruined..</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: …I have to tell Father. Before it’s too
late..</p>

day</strong>: 49 49</p>
<p><strong>a family meeting</strong>: ANNE and HENRY PERCY, , stand in
front of the DUKE of NORFOLK and SIR THOMAS BOLEYN and GEORGE..</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: What were you thinking? The marriage of
a senior noble is a matter of state. Something only the King can
decide..</p>
<p><strong>norfolk</strong>: Who knows about this?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: No one.</p>
<p><strong>norfolk</strong>: Then that is how it shall remain.
Forever.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: But you cannot undo what has been done before
God. And consummated too.</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: There have been improper intimacies,
too?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I have lain with my husband. There is nothing
improper about it..</p>
<p><strong>norfolk</strong>: SILENCE! My God, if you were my daughter
I’d thrash you within an inch of your life..</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: The boy will return to Northumberland -
where he will marry the Talbot girl. As arranged.</p>
<p><strong>orfolk</strong>: As for you. You will go to France and stay
there until you have learned your lesson.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>orfolk</strong>: How could you do this to your sister? You
know full well her friendship with the King is at an extremely delicate
stage. Any scandal or black mark against Mary’s name now could be
fatal.</p>
<p><strong>norfolk</strong>: You will join the court of the French
Queen. And stay there until your father has forgiven you.</p>
<p><strong>int. corridor outside - day</strong>: 50 50</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: ou told them, didn’t you? How COULD you?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Because you would never have got away with it.
And it would have ruined your prospects forever. Believe me. I did it
for your good.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Really? For MY good? I’ll try to remind myself
of that. While I’m in exile. And you’re here, in the King’s bed, and
unchallenged for our father’s affection. That it was for MY good. Not
yours.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: ANNE, wait..!</p>
<p><strong>over this</strong>: we fade in MUSIC and the sound of
laughter..</p>
<p><strong>int. ball-room - palace - night</strong>: 1 51</p>
<p><strong>masked man</strong>: Why look so glum, Mary?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What reason have I to be happy?</p>
<p><strong>masked man</strong>: ou have two men, the King of England and
I, both fighting for your love.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Do I know you?</p>
<p><strong>masked man</strong>: You know me, Mary - but not half as well
as I know you. I know you better than anyone here. And love you better
than anyone here, too. And if God had made ME your husband instead of
William Carey, one thing I know.. I would never have let you go.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Wait! Who ARE you?</p>
<p><strong>asked man #2</strong>: Ah! Who have we here?!?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: My name is Kindness.</p>
<p><strong>masked man #2</strong>: wonder, will you be kind to me?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What is it you desire?</p>
<p><strong>masked man #2</strong>: our love, fair Lady.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You demand a great deal.</p>
<p><strong>masked man #2</strong>: No more than I would give in
return.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: It is easy for a man to declare love from
behind a mask.</p>
<p><strong>asked man #2</strong>: ut if I remove it, you might reject
me.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: If your feelings were sincere, I would never
reject you.</p>
<p><strong>masked man #2</strong>: But you do not know who I am? I could
be ugly. Or poor.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: o matter how you looked. Or who you were.</p>
<p><strong>masked man #2</strong>: Really? Then I shall hold you to your
word. And unmask..!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Your Majesty..!</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: he faints! Quick! Take her to my rooms! Call
my physicians..!</p>
<p><strong>int. king’s apartment - court - night</strong>: 52 52</p>
<p><strong>enry</strong>: Go! Leave us! Go!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Thank you, your Grace.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>:
<code>Henry', please. The first rule of this room, is to leave</code>Your
Grace’s’ and `Your Majesty’s’ outside.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Is there anything I can bring you?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Nothing to increase your comfort or well-
being?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You might ask your servants to bring me some
water.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: There. There ARE no servants.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: So, this is it? This is where the King of
England sleeps?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: And reads. And writes. And finds a few
moments each day… …for himself.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I am. I suppose it’s more..</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: ..simple than I imagined.</p>
<p><strong>enry</strong>: There’s no need for show. I am only ever here
alone.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: And yet you invite me here?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Because I trust you.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You hardly know me.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: A man in my position develops an instinct.
You would never lie, could never lie to me.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I also sense…that you might relish an
opportunity to be yourself, too.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Well, here you only say what you like, do
what you like.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Very well.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’d like an apple, please.. ..Henry.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Now it’s your turn.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: To say something, or do something you couldn’t
outside.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: There are many things I cannot admit to in
public. Sadness, for example. And loneliness.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: But when you are loved as much as you are? How
can you be lonely?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Do you not know what it is to be lonely in a
marriage?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Yes. I do now.</p>
<p><strong>enry</strong>: married my brother’s widow because my</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: But I never looked at her or longed for her
the way I do you.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Imagine how different it might have been. For
both of us..had we been able to chose for ourselves..</p>

<p><strong>stafford</strong>: I have orders to bring you to your
father.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: My father..? Well, we’d better not keep him
waiting.</p>
<p><strong>int. norfolk’s study - court - day</strong>: 55 55</p>
<p><strong>norfolk</strong>: Well..?</p>
<p><strong>norfolk</strong>: Did he have you?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>norfolk</strong>: More than once?</p>
<p><strong>norfolk</strong>: You’d better get used to talking about it.
Once you sleep with the king, it’s not a private matter any more.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Yes. More than once.</p>
<p><strong>norfolk</strong>: So he was satisfied?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I believe so, Uncle.</p>
<p><strong>norfolk</strong>: ood. This is where our work begins. It’s
one thing to catch the king. Quite another to keep him.</p>
<p><strong>norfolk</strong>: I want you to keep her spotless, hair
washed every day. She must read all the latest books and be able to
venture and defend an interesting opinion. She must know her music, must
be energetic and entertaining - in company and in bed. That’s how he
likes his women. And if ever she’s in any doubt as to how to conduct
herself, or what to do next - she should simply watch the Queen. That
woman kept him from straying for eleven years. And the effort almost
killed her.</p>
<p><strong>int. palace - day</strong>: 56 56</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: The biggest warship in the fleet. Thirty- two
guns and two hundred feet long, and with your permission Thomas.. ..I’d
like to name her after your daughter. The “Mary Boleyn”.</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: Majesty! I’m…I’m speechless..</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: onsense. She’s an angel. It’s the least she
deserves. And if there’s anything else I can do for YOU, my friend..as
an expression of my gratitude..let me know.</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: s it happens..there is one thing.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Name it.</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: ur son, George. He’s of an age now..</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: You want me to make him a match?</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: Yes, your Majesty.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Do you have anyone in mind?</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: There is one lady, Sir..</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Go on..</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: Who I fear is too high-born for us. And
following the unfortunate matter between Anne and Henry Percy, I didn’t
want my children to overreach themselves again..</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: verreach themselves?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: One is currently in the King’s bed. If they
are good enough for me, I suggest they’re good enough for anyone else.
So.. Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>over this</strong>: we hear GEORGE’s distraught voice..</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Jane Parker..?</p>
<p><strong>int. sir thomas’s study - london - day</strong>: 57 57</p>
<p><strong>eorge</strong>: I beg you, Father. No.</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: She’s well connected, her father is
cousin to the King. And there’s money, too.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: But must I actually…marry her?</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: thought you had ambitions for this</p>
<p><strong>eorge</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: And that you wish to make a contribution
yourself. Not just stand back and watch your sisters.</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: Then my advice would be to start
behaving like a man. A real man. Do I make myself clear?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yes, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>int. ball-room - parker family castle - night</strong>: 58
58</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: For God’s sake, it’s the wedding of our
youngest child attended by the King of England and the greatest Lords in
the Land. Would a smile be too much to ask?</p>
<p><strong>lady elizabeth</strong>: What’s to smile about? I’m a mother
with one child on his wedding day looking like he’s been condemned to
death.</p>
<p><strong>lady elizabeth</strong>: Another banished abroad, in
disgrace. And a third whoring in public with an adulterer.</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: For the moment she’s happy.</p>
<p><strong>lady elizabeth</strong>: But will she be happy when he leaves
her? Because you know that’s how it will end.</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: Only God knows how anything will
end.</p>
<p><strong>lady elizabeth</strong>: God..? He turned his back on all
this a long time ago.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: You’re in love with him, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: illiam, you’re drunk.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: How is it? With him?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: He pleases me. Is that what you want to
hear?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: What does he do to you? Tell me. I want to
know..</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: I know you look at me with contempt. But I
had no choice. Your father insisted I stand aside. What was I expected
to do?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Say `no’, husband. That was all you had to
do.</p>

<p><strong>int. court - accommodation - day</strong>: 63 63</p>

<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: There’s more. Thanks to you, I am to
become an Earl. Your brother a Viscount.</p>
<p>****: So our debts are paid off.</p>
<p><strong>lady elizabeth</strong>: Just be aware. These
<code>gifts', this</code>favour’ can go as swiftly as it comes. These
rooms belonged to the Duke of Buckingham. Once the King’s closest
friend. Now his head rots on a spike..</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: Because he committed treason.</p>
<p><strong>ady elizabeth</strong>: But what is `treason’? It’s anything
the King or his lawyers decide it to be. Anything that offends him, or
causes him displeasure. And can you assure me we’ll never do that?</p>

the child..</p>

immediately.</p>

But for how long? The Queen will soon have his head spinning with pretty
little Spanish things. Not to mention the Seymours with that girl of
theirs.</p>
<p><strong>norfolk</strong>: What we need is someone from OUR family who
will keep the King focused on Mary, reminding him of her while she is
absent.</p>
<p><strong>norfolk</strong>: What? Speak..</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: It’s just…I was going to suggest
Anne.</p>
<p><strong>norfolk</strong>: You couldn’t control that girl last time.
What makes you think it would be any different now?</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: I’ve had favourable reports from the
Dowager Queen in France. It seems she is quite changed.</p>
<p><strong>int. mary’s apartment - day</strong>: 71 71</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I suppose they felt three years of exile was
punishment enough.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: But the King visits me every day. There’s no
need for her. Or anyone else.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: They just want to protect you. Leave nothing
to chance.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: But in who’s interests do they imagine Anne
will act? Certainly not mine.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Don’t worry. She’s had three years to
forgive you. And she’s not going to risk being sent away again. She’ll
do as she’s told, I’m sure. Besides, the most important thing is..</p>

conversation.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: What’s the noise? I can hardly hear myself
think!</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: It’s Mistress Boleyn, your Majesty. Her
stories about life at the French court. They are particularly
amusing.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I’m only aware of one Boleyn girl and she is
lying-in with a certain child in her belly!</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: It’s my elder daughter, Anne, your
Majesty. She has returned to court.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: What? That awful girl, Thomas? The one that
almost killed me? You allowed her back?</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: The time abroad has done her good, your
Majesty. I’m certain you’d find her much improved.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Really..?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Well, come on. Where are you, other Boleyn
girl? Show your face.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: So? What is so amusing, Anne? Perhaps we
might hear and judge for ourselves?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I was just giving my thoughts on the new
French King.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Which are..?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: That for someone with such great wealth, and
power..he has surprisingly little authority as a man.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Hah!</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: And is SO consumed by one particular rivalry
he can barely think.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: eally? And who is this rival?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: A neighbouring King, who’s name one is
forbidden to mention at court. Whose reputation haunts him in his
thoughts and dreams.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Whose armies and navy thwart his every
endeavour. Whose physical and intellectual endowments are known far and
wide.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: In order to restore his confidence, this
French King spends a fortune on anything that glitters, on building of
castles with large towers..</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: But these symbols of wealth and virility fail
to convince. Talk among the ladies at court in France suggests..</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: ANNE stops herself…</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: That in this department too, the King has his
shortcomings.</p>
<p><strong>int. mary’s bedroom - day</strong>: 77 77</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: You should have seen the Seymours! Their
faces!</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: They must have thought that with you out
of the way, they had a real opportunity with that pale-faced thing of
theirs, Jane…</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Or HER, you mean.</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: ’m wary of any suggestion that Anne would
serve anyone but herself. France can’t have changed her THAT much.</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: n this occasion I am quite satisfied she
was being loyal to you.</p>

with G</p>
<p><strong>eorge</strong>: Yes, my Lord.</p>
<p><strong>enry</strong>: Tell me. Are they as different in temper as
they are in looks?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh, yes. Each has her own, quite distinct
virtues. Mary for example..</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I’m familiar with Mary’s. Tell me about
Anne’s.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Anne? Well, she’s strong. Some might say
`difficult’.</p>
<p><strong>enry</strong>: Headstrong. With a fiery temper.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: But with it comes great passion, too. It’s
both the best and the worst thing about her. There are no half measures
with Anne.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Careful, you’ll make me think I chose the
wrong Boleyn girl.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh, no. I’m certain Mary is the right
choice. You will have a serene, happy, life with her. The risk is with
Anne, it might be like being caught in a wild summer storm.</p>

<p><strong>anne</strong>: Your Grace?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: You received my gifts?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: And? They did not please you?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: On the contrary, my Lord. They pleased me
greatly.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Then why did you return them?</p>
<p><strong>int. boleyn apartments - day</strong>: 92 92</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: ecause my sister lies in bed with your child.
If you wish to please me, Sir, then send her the gifts you send me.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I have shown Mary enough kindness and
generosity. It’s you I want, Anne.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: beg you, my Lord, do not do this. What</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: YOU. Don’t you see? YOU have changed.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: But Mary is still the mother of your child.
And even if she weren’t..</p>
<p><strong>enry</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: How could I forget that you chose her above me
when we first met? You liked her better.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Not true..</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Either way, I could never betray my own
sister..</p>
<p><strong>an</strong>: Now I beg you, leave me. This is too difficult
to bear.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: You see! The same pain as mine! It proves you
feel the same way!</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Perhaps. But since it can never come to
anything..</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Let me decide that. For now, you have given
me hope.</p>
<p><strong>h</strong>: ENRY goes on bended knee, kisses her hand, and
goes. ANNE is left alone. She breathes out. Then looks down at her
hands.</p>

<p><strong>henry</strong>: Anne..</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Anne, I love you..</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Your Grace, this is not the time..</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I love you Anne. I cannot stop thinking about
you. I cannot eat, I cannot sleep..</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: But how could I ever TRUST you?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: When I have seen how you have betrayed first
your wife. And now my sister.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I vow from this moment forth I will never lie
with my wife, or speak to your sister again. I will do anything you
ask..</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Then don’t acknowledge the child.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>physician</strong>: A boy!</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: It’s a boy, your Majesty. A strong,
healthy boy.</p>

too.</p>

this! Not a single detail was left to chance! And now, in the moment of
our greatest glory..</p>
<p><strong>norfolk</strong>: All I can say is you’d better have a plan.
And it had better work.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Or what…Uncle?</p>
<p><strong>lady elizabeth</strong>: Stop it! Both of you. What shall we
do about Mary? And the child? Or have we forgotten them already?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Mary should go back to her husband.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: She has been inconvenienced long enough by
this family.</p>
<p><strong>ady elizabeth</strong>: Fine. Then you can be the one to tell
her.</p>

privilege.</p>

<p><strong>anne</strong>: I understand you’re angry - but be assured. I
did nothing, except remind him of you.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Oh, spare me. You did this deliberately. As
revenge. And now you have what you wanted you probably think justice has
been done.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Well, hasn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Be careful, that’s my advice. Learn from my
experience. Because he’ll only do to you what he has done to me.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Never. I’ll make sure he understands I’m a
greater thing by far. That he can never have me until he makes me a far
greater offer.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You’ll never get Henry Percy back, if that’s
what you mean.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: That’s not what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: And don’t you ever mention his name to me
again. I’ll never forget how you betrayed me.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: If that’s what you think, fine. Tell yourself
that.</p>

Fitzroy or some other sign that he is a royal bast…</p>

<p><strong>anne</strong>: As what?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: My one true mistress. To whom I am loyal
above all others?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: But it’s not true. You are loyal to the QUEEN
above all others.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: My wife? I barely see her.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: But she sits on a throne beside you.
Accompanies you to every state function.</p>
<p><strong>enry</strong>: For appearance sakes only. In every other
regard, our marriage is a sham.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Still, she is your WIFE. And ever present. And
I feel her eyes on me. And those of her spies.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: And look at us. Forever reduced to meeting in
secret like this. Speaking in whispers. Hardly conducive to passion?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Well, what would you have me do?</p>
<p><strong>int. court - day</strong>: 108 108</p>

<p><strong>henry</strong>: Wolsey has agreed to draw up plans for the
Queen to be sent to a nunnery.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: She will protest, of course. She won’t go
quietly, but she knows she has failed to give me a son, and deserves her
exile. Which leaves you all alone at court..</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: …queen in all but name. Mother to any future
heir.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: So, is this assurance enough? Will you give
yourself to me now?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I’d like to. But I’m afraid I find the insult
too much to bear.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: What insult?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Because as long as we remain unmarried, any
child I gave you would forever be daubed
<code>bastard' and I a</code>whore’.</p>
<p><strong>enry</strong>: ut what alternative is there? My love for the
Queen may have died, but even you must concede, she is still very much
alive. A</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Katherine of Aragon is alive. That woman is
not worthy of the title `Queen’.</p>
<p><strong>enry</strong>: Oh, Anne.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I really do not know why we waste time talking
of convents when you could annul the marriage.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Annul it?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: That woman married two brothers and therefore
sinned against God.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: But she never consummated the marriage with
my brother.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: They were married six months.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Arthur was a sick man.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: And Katherine is a shrewd woman who knew that
her position as Queen would never be safe until she bedded your brother.
Talk to your advisers. They will tell you as much.</p>
<p><strong>int. court - several months later - day</strong>: 110 110</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Wolsey has agreed to charge the Queen?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: But that’s wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Why do you look sad?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Because she will contest it. Which means
putting her on trial. And hearing these delicate matters in public.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: es. But any court made up of YOUR Bishops will
surely find in YOUR favour. And declare the marriage invalid.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: hen you, my sweet Lord, will be free to
remarry. Then I can give myself to you fully. And give you everything
you.. ..desire.</p>

<p><strong>mary</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>stafford</strong>: I brought gifts from your family. A
night-dress from your mother. This from your Uncle George.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Please be sure to thank them - though one
wonders what’s kept them so busy that not a single one of them found
time to visit the new baby.</p>
<p><strong>stafford</strong>: It’s Anne. She’s turning this country on
its head. She has persuaded the king to test the validity of his
marriage, and put the QueenM on trial.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>stafford</strong>: She continues to hold out. Expertly
witholding her favours until…</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: ..until what?</p>
<p><strong>stafford</strong>: Until he makes her the ultimate offer.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: High stakes indeed.</p>
<p><strong>ext. rochford hall - stable yard - day</strong>: 113 113</p>

Father. I lost track of their latest titles.</p>

unwell.</p>

<p><strong>henry</strong>: The Queen has insisted a Papal representative
be present at the trial. But Wolsey has assured me the trial will
proceed for appearance sake only. We have our verdict.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Then what troubles you?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: One or two friends have refused to lend their
support. Among them, Thomas More. And then there’s the small matter of
my conscience.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Why? You have justice on your side.</p>

<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: `Mary Talbot’.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: Mary Talbot!! The girl that married
Henry Percy. It seems she has petitioned the King, demanding a divorce
from her husband …that his prior betrothal to you was actually..
..consummated.</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: I knew this would come back to haunt
us!</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I must go to the King.</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: No! He doesn’t want to see you! Or hear
a word from your lips! He’s far too angry. It seems the only Boleyn he
will speak to, the only person who’s testimony he will trust in this
matter.. …is Mary.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Mary?</p>
<p><strong>ext. cemetery - day</strong>: 122 122</p>

hair.</p>

<p><strong>anne</strong>: Thank you for coming.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I hate how this matter has come between us. I
wanted to come to see you after your daughter was born, and again when
your husband died, but..</p>

<p><strong>mary</strong>: Leave me. Please..?</p>

128</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I am forever in your debt.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You owe me nothing, sister. I did it that we
may finally draw a line beneath everything that has happened between
us.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: hen let it be exactly that. A new start
between us. Here at court.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Thank you. But I’d rather go back to our home
in the country.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: What? That damp old ruin? With no food? Or
warmth? Why don’t you let your family look after you? Your children
would have the best of everything here. They would grow up safe and
secure.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: ho’s that?</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: The Papal Legate. Sent by the Pope to
preside over the Queen’s trial.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: So, it’s true. It’s really happening?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Yes, it is. Stay with me, please? I need my

do are in Wolsey’s pocket.</p>
<p><strong>q</strong>: pushes it aside, intimidatingly flanked by her
LAWYERS..</p>
<p><strong>ueen katherine</strong>: So..the Boleyn whores. Two former
ladies of mine. Hiding in shadows. What did I do to upset you, that you
should turn against me like this?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: You failed to give England an heir.</p>
<p><strong>queen katherine</strong>: And that upsets you so?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: What upsets the King upsets me.</p>
<p><strong>queen katherine</strong>: How dare you!</p>
<p><strong>crier</strong>: Katherine, Queen of England, come into
court..!</p>
<p><strong>queen katherine</strong>: ou want me to creep away and become
a nun? Well, I shall not. You want me to lie before God and admit my
first marriage was consummated? Well, it was not.</p>
<p><strong>katherine</strong>: My Lord, how have I offended you? For
twenty years, I have been a true, obedient wife. I have loved all those
whom you loved, and given you children though it has pleased God to take
them away. If there is any just cause that you can allege against me, I
will happily depart to my shame and dishonour, but I tell you, as God is
my witness, there is none.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: You are.</p>
<p><strong>katherine</strong>: ..then let it be in a proper court and by
the only authority I recognise. His holiness himself.</p>
<p><strong>wolsey</strong>: Since it has pleased the Queen to absent
herself from the court, the trial will simply proceed without her.</p>
<p><strong>int. boleyn family home - night</strong>: 131 131</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Wolsey promised the King his verdict. Instead
he has humiliated him.</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: But they are continuing with the trial.
And the Bishops will still find in the King’s favour.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Yes. But without the Pope’s blessing, the
result will seem hollow. If only the King would take matters into his
own hands.</p>
<p><strong>ady elizabeth</strong>: And do what? His only option would be
to reject the Catholic Church? And his faith would never allow it.</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: Nor his good sense. Breaking with Rome
would isolate England politically. Leave us at the mercy of the
Protestants.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: But the alternative is leaving this country
without an heir. Failing in his duty as a King. And risking civil
war.</p>
<p><strong>s</strong>: omehow I need to make him understand that it is a
fair price for a legitimate heir.</p>

apart this country for you, gone against every principle in my heart,
I’ve endured the doubts and counsel of good men and silenced them with

know you.</p>

forever?</p>

loves you, and follow.</p>

<p><strong>mary</strong>: ister, I wonder if you’ve given any
thought..to the matter of my returning to the country. With the
children.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: What? No! I need you here more than ever.
Besides, as the Queen’s sister, you can’t live alone out there like some
gypsy. We need to make you a proper match.</p>

Lord Fardingly. Marry him and you’d own half Scotland..</p>

trinity will be mother, uncle and aunt to the next King of England.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: But if it isn’t? The King will take that as
evidence of God’s displeasure. And will turn further against me. He’s
already become so cold.</p>

more disgusting…then he hates himself in the morning…hates me even more
for what I made him do…</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: It’s slipping away, Mary. I can feel it.</p>
<p><strong>int. anne’s bedroom - night</strong>: 150 150 1 HENRY
repeatedly strikes her. Hating her. Hating himself.</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: And..?</p>
<p><strong>ext. river thames - winter party - months later -
day</strong>: 153 153</p>
<p><strong>eorge</strong>: And so, it’s come to this. Our sister is with
child, and all England’s fate is in the balance.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: The King will have to move swiftly to
silence his enemies. He will claim innocence. That he was corrupted.
Anne will swiftly be replaced as Queen, by someone more `acceptable’.
And we Boleyns will never be able to show our faces at court again.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: That’s no bad thing.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Anyone with any sense would have run away from
this hell-hole already. As far as they could go.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: ike the wise William Stafford.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You didn’t know? Sold up and went. Left for
the country. Just like that. Gone to live in some place called..</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: ..Tatton.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Where he grew up, apparently. Did you know
he came from a better stable than all of us? His grandmother was a
Beaufort, cousin to the King. And he never mentioned it. Who’d have
guessed?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I’m fine, thank you. Just a bad dream.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: But fetch my brother and sister, will you?</p>
<p><strong>w</strong>: hen ANNE sees what lies beneath, she howls in
horror.</p>
<p><strong>int. anne’s bedroom - court - night</strong>: 155 155</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I lost it. Almost without pain. And so fast it
was over in a moment.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Oh, Anne..</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: ou have to get rid of it. Bury it. Get rid of
it somehow. No one must know.</p>
<p><strong>an hour later</strong>: ANNE is composed. Staring into the
fire. MARY and GEORGE sit on either side of her.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: It’s not the first. Miscarriage.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: They will take it as proof that I cannot bear
children. That I am cursed by God. And should be dispensed with.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Why? There’s still time. You could sleep with
the King, and fall pregnant again. No one would know..</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: he King would never lie with me now, and risk
damaging the `child’ he believes I’m carrying.. Besides, he is barely
capable anymore. And I couldn’t go through that again.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: No, if I am to survive..I have to take matters
into my own hands.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I..I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I need a baby, Mary. Must I spell it out?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You mean lying with another man?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: But that would be treason.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: esides, where would you find someone you could
trust?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Obviously, it would have to be someone close.
Very close..</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What..? No..!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Stop it, Anne! It’s madness..</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Don’t you see? This affects all of us. If I go
down, so do all of you. The only way to save ourselves..is to do this..
And pray it’s a boy.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I can’t listen to this.. …this is
monstrous..</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Mary, sit down..</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: No, Anne! I understand you have had a shock
tonight. A terrible shock. But there is no need for this..</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Come, George..</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: George is staying. He understands this
involves the whole family..</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: No. Come, George..</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: George, is STAYING!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I pray for you both.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Mary! Come back!</p>

it’s only a matter of time.</p>

<p><strong>stafford</strong>: ou think he will listen? It’s his own neck
he’s saving by getting rid of them, can’t you see?</p>
<p><strong>stafford</strong>: Fine, go. But if you do, you might as well
kiss your children goodbye. You are Anne’s sister. That alone makes you
her accomplice and co-conspirator.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I have no choice. Anne and George are my
family. I cannot desert them.</p>

not rise for their Queen.</p>
<p><strong>norfolk</strong>: And even sadder when that same Queen is
charged with adultery and incest.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Charged is different to convicted, Uncle. Or
is it not? In this court?</p>
<p><strong>norfolk</strong>: Master Cromwell, read out the
indictment..</p>
<p><strong>cromwell</strong>: The charge is that in the twenty-eighth
year of the reign of our Sovereign Henry, King of England, his wife, the
Queen, being seduced by the Devil, did knowingly commit adultery, high

<p><strong>anne</strong>: My noble Lords..the love I have for my brother
is the love any sister would have for someone with whom she has grown up
in the same house, nursed when sick, played games as children, shared
life’s celebrations.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: That is the love I have for him. Not what you
suggest.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Judge me, my Lords, as you see fit. But never
forget that your verdicts will be judged again by God, in the greatest
court of all..</p>

must she die, too?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: She has been tried and found guilty.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You could send her away.</p>
<p><strong>enry</strong>: I am bound by the law.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You could send her to a nunnery. No one would
know.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Anne? To a nunnery?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: There is precedent, my Lord. Louis of France
did it, too. When his wife could not conceive.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: The French Queen was a blameless woman. Your
sister a witch.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I understand Anne has offended you. I ask only
that if there is any regret you might..feel yourself.</p>
<p><strong>enry</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: For your part in the matter..</p>

<p><strong>mary</strong>: Yes.</p>

underestimated little Mary.</p>

<p><strong>mary</strong>: That’s not true.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: It is. He never loved me in the same way. And
deep down you know it.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: You should have been Queen. You even gave him
a son. But instead all this has happened because.. Because I couldn’t
