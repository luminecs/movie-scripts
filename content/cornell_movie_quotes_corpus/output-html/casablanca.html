<h1 id="casablanca">casablanca</h1>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: With the coming of the Second World War,
many eyes in imprisoned Europe turned hopefully, or desperately, toward
the freedom of the Americas. Lisbon became the great embarkation point.
But not everybody could get to Lisbon directly, and so, a tortuous,
roundabout refugee trail sprang up. Paris to Marseilles, across the
Mediterranean to Oran, then by train, or auto, or foot, across the rim
of Africa to Casablanca in French Morocco. Here, the fortunate ones,
through money, or influence, or luck, might obtain exit visas and scurry
to Lisbon, and from Lisbon to the New World. But the others wait in
Casablanca – and wait – and wait – and wait.</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: To all officers! Two German couriers
carrying important official documents murdered on train from Oran.
Murderer and possible accomplices headed for Casablanca. Round up all
suspicious characters and search them for stolen documents.
Important!</p>
<p><strong>first policeman</strong>: May we see your papers?</p>
<p><strong>civilian</strong>: I don’t think I have them on me.</p>
<p><strong>first policeman</strong>: In that case, we’ll have to ask you
to come along.</p>
<p><strong>civilian</strong>: Wait. It’s just possible that I… Yes, here
they are.</p>
<p><strong>second policeman</strong>: These papers expired three weeks
ago. You’ll have to come along.</p>
<p><strong>englishwoman</strong>: What on earth’s going on there?</p>
<p><strong>englishman</strong>: I don’t know, my dear.</p>
<p><strong>european</strong>: Pardon, pardon, Monsieur, pardon Madame,
have you not heard?</p>
<p><strong>englishman</strong>: We hear very little, and we understand
even less.</p>
<p><strong>european</strong>: Two German couriers were found murdered in
the desert… the unoccupied desert. This is the customary roundup of
refugees, liberals, and uh, of course, a beautiful young girl for
Monsieur Renault, the Prefect of Police.</p>
<p><strong>european</strong>: Unfortunately, along with these unhappy
refugees the scum of Europe has gravitated to Casablanca. Some of them
have been waiting years for a visa.</p>
<p><strong>european</strong>: I beg of you, Monsieur, watch yourself. Be
on guard. This place is full of vultures, vultures everywhere,
everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>englishman</strong>: Ha, ha, thank you, thank you very
much.</p>
<p><strong>european</strong>: Not at all. Au revoir, Monsieur. Au
revoir, Madame.</p>
<p><strong>englishman</strong>: Au revoir. Amusing little fellow.
Waiter!</p>
<p><strong>englishman</strong>: Oh. How silly of me.</p>
<p><strong>englishwoman</strong>: What, dear?</p>
<p><strong>englishman</strong>: I’ve left my wallet in the hotel.</p>
<p><strong>englishwoman</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>annina</strong>: Perhaps tomorrow we’ll be on that plane.</p>
<p><strong>heinze</strong>: Heil Hitler.</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: Heil Hitler.</p>
<p><strong>heinze</strong>: It is very good to see you again, Major
Strasser.</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: Thank you. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>heinze</strong>: May I present Captain Renault, Police
Prefect of Casablanca. Major Strasser.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Unoccupied France welcomes you to
Casablanca.</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: Thank you, Captain. It’s very good to be
here.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Major Strasser, my aide, Lieutenant
Casselle.</p>
<p><strong>tonelli</strong>: Captain Tonelli, the Italian service, at
your command, Major.</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: That is kind of you.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: You may find the climate of Casablanca a
trifle warm, Major.</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: Oh, we Germans must get used to all
climates, from Russia to the Sahara. But perhaps you were not referring
to the weather.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: What else, my dear Major?</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: By the way, the murder of the couriers,
what has been done?</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Realizing the importance of the case, my
men are rounding up twice the usual number of suspects.</p>
<p><strong>heinze</strong>: We already know who the murderer is.</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: Good. Is he in custody?</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Oh, there is no hurry. Tonight he’ll be at
Rick’s. Everybody comes to Rick’s.</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: I have already heard about this cafe, and
also about Mr. Rick himself.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Waiting, waiting, waiting. I’ll never get out
of here. I’ll die in Casablanca.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: But can’t you make it just a little more?
Please.</p>
<p><strong>moor</strong>: I’m sorry, Madame, but diamonds are a drug on
the market. Everybody sells diamonds. There are diamonds everywhere. Two
thousand, four hundred.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>conspirator</strong>: The trucks are waiting, the men are
waiting. Everything is…</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: It’s the fishing smack Santiago. It leaves at
one tomorrow night, here from the end of La Medina. Third boat.</p>
<p><strong>refugee</strong>: Thank you, oh, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: And bring fifteen thousand francs in cash.
Remember, in cash.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Open up, Abdul.</p>
<p><strong>abdul</strong>: Yes, Herr Professor.</p>
<p><strong>first woman</strong>: Uh, waiter.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yes, Madame?</p>
<p><strong>first woman</strong>: Will you ask Rick if he’ll have a drink
with us?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Madame, he never drinks with customers. Never.
I have never seen him.</p>
<p><strong>second woman</strong>: What makes saloon-keepers so
snobbish?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Perhaps if you told him I ran the second
largest banking house in Amsterdam.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: The second largest? That wouldn’t impress
Rick. The leading banker in Amsterdam is now the pastry chef in our
kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: We have something to look forward to.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: And his father is the bell boy.</p>
<p><strong>abdul</strong>: I’m sorry sir, this is a private room.</p>
<p><strong>german</strong>: Of all the nerve! Who do you think… I know
there’s gambling in there! There’s no secret. You dare not keep me out
of here!</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Yes? What’s the trouble?</p>
<p><strong>abdul</strong>: This gentleman –</p>
<p><strong>german</strong>: I’ve been in every gambling room between
Honolulu and Berlin and if you think I’m going to be kept out of a
saloon like this, you’re very much mistaken.</p>
<p><strong>ugarte</strong>: Uh, excuse me, please. Hello, Rick.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Hello Ugarte.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Your cash is good at the bar.</p>
<p><strong>german</strong>: What! Do you know who I am?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I do. You’re lucky the bar’s open to you.</p>
<p><strong>german</strong>: This is outrageous. I shall report it to the
Angriff!</p>
<p><strong>ugarte</strong>: Huh. You know, Rick, watching you just now
with the Deutsches Bank, one would think you’d been doing this all your
life.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Well, what makes you think I haven’t?</p>
<p><strong>ugarte</strong>: Oh, nothing. But when you first came to
Casablanca, I thought –</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: – You thought what?</p>
<p><strong>ugarte</strong>: What right do I have to think?</p>
<p><strong>ugarte</strong>: May I? Too bad about those two German
couriers, wasn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: They got a lucky break. Yesterday they were
just two German clerks. Today they’re the ‘Honored Dead’.</p>
<p><strong>ugarte</strong>: You are a very cynical person, Rick, if
you’ll forgive me for saying so.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I forgive you.</p>
<p><strong>ugarte</strong>: Thank you. Will you have a drink with me
please?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ugarte</strong>: I forgot. You never drink with… I’ll have
another, please. You despise me, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: If I gave you any thought, I probably
would.</p>
<p><strong>ugarte</strong>: But why? Oh, you object to the kind of
business I do, huh? But think of all those poor refugees who must rot in
this place if I didn’t help them. That’s not so bad. Through ways of my
own I provide them with exit visas.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: For a price, Ugarte, for a price.</p>
<p><strong>ugarte</strong>: But think of all the poor devils who cannot
meet Renault’s price. I get it for them for half. Is that so
parasitic?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I don’t mind a parasite. I object to a
cut-rate one.</p>
<p><strong>ugarte</strong>: Well, Rick, after tonight I’ll be through
with the whole business, and I am leaving finally this Casablanca.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Who did you bribe for your visa? Renault or
yourself?</p>
<p><strong>ugarte</strong>: Myself. I found myself much more
reasonable.</p>
<p><strong>ugarte</strong>: Look, Rick, do you know what this is?
Something that even you have never seen. Letters of transit signed by
General de Gaulle. Cannot be rescinded, not even questioned.</p>
<p><strong>ugarte</strong>: One moment. Tonight I’ll be selling those
for more money than even I have ever dreamed of, and then, addio
Casablanca! You know, Rick, I have many friends in Casablanca, but
somehow, just because you despise me you’re the only one I trust. Will
you keep these for me? Please.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: For how long?</p>
<p><strong>ugarte</strong>: Perhaps an hour, perhaps a little
longer.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I don’t want them here overnight.</p>
<p><strong>ugarte</strong>: Don’t be afraid of that. Please keep them
for me. Thank you. I knew I could trust you.</p>
<p><strong>ugarte</strong>: Oh, waiter. I’ll be expecting some people.
If anybody asks for me, I’ll be right here.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Yes, Monsieur.</p>
<p><strong>ugarte</strong>: Rick, I hope you are more impressed with me
now, huh? If you’ll forgive me, I’ll share my good luck with your
roulette wheel.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Just a moment.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Yeah, I heard a rumor that those German
couriers were carrying letters of transit.</p>
<p><strong>ugarte</strong>: Huh? I heard that rumor, too. Poor
devils.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Yes, you’re right, Ugarte. I am a little more
impressed with you.</p>
<p><strong>ferrari</strong>: Hello, Rick.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Hello, Ferrari. How’s business at the Blue
Parrot?</p>
<p><strong>ferrari</strong>: Fine, but I would like to buy your
cafe.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: It’s not for sale.</p>
<p><strong>ferrari</strong>: You haven’t heard my offer.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: It’s not for sale at any price.</p>
<p><strong>ferrari</strong>: What do you want for Sam?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I don’t buy or sell human beings.</p>
<p><strong>ferrari</strong>: That’s too bad. That’s Casablanca’s leading
commodity. In refugees alone we could make a fortune if you would work
with me through the black market.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Suppose you run your business and let me run
mine.</p>
<p><strong>ferrari</strong>: Suppose we ask Sam. Maybe he’d like to make
a change.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Suppose we do.</p>
<p><strong>ferrari</strong>: My dear Rick, when will you realize that in
this world today isolationism is no longer a practical policy?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Sam, Ferrari wants you to work for him at the
Blue Parrot.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I like it fine here.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: He’ll double what I pay you.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Yeah, but I ain’t got time to spend the money I
make here.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>sacha</strong>: The boss’s private stock. Because, Yvonne, I
loff you.</p>
<p><strong>yvonne</strong>: Oh, shut up.</p>
<p><strong>sacha</strong>: All right, all right. For you, Yvonne, I shot
opp, because, Yvonne, I loff you. Uh oh.</p>
<p><strong>sacha</strong>: Oh, Monsieur Rick, Monsieur Rick. Some
Germans, boom, boom, boom, boom, gave this check. Is it all right?</p>
<p><strong>yvonne</strong>: Where were you last night?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: That’s so long ago, I don’t remember.</p>
<p><strong>yvonne</strong>: Will I see you tonight?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I never make plans that far ahead.</p>
<p><strong>yvonne</strong>: Give me another.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Sacha, she’s had enough.</p>
<p><strong>yvonne</strong>: Don’t listen to him, Sacha. Fill it up.</p>
<p><strong>sacha</strong>: Yvonne, I loff you, but he pays me.</p>
<p><strong>yvonne</strong>: Rick, I’m sick and tired of having you –</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: – Sacha, call a cab.</p>
<p><strong>sacha</strong>: Yes, boss.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Come on, we’re going to get your coat.</p>
<p><strong>yvonne</strong>: Take your hands off me!</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: No. You’re going home. You’ve had a little too
much to drink.</p>
<p><strong>sacha</strong>: Taxi!</p>
<p><strong>yvonne</strong>: Who do you think you are, pushing me around?
What a fool I was to fall for a man like you.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: You’d better go with her, Sacha, to be sure
she gets home.</p>
<p><strong>sacha</strong>: Yes, boss.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: And come right back.</p>
<p><strong>sacha</strong>: Yes, boss.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Hello, Rick.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Hello, Louis.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: How extravagant you are, throwing away
women like that. Someday they may be scarce.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: You know, I think now I shall pay a call on
Yvonne, maybe get her on the rebound, eh?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: When it comes to women, you’re a true
democrat.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: If he gets a word in it’ll be a major
Italian victory.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: The plane to Lisbon. You would like to be
on it?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Why? What’s in Lisbon?</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: The clipper to America.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: I have often speculated on why you don’t
return to America. Did you abscond with the church funds? Did you run
off with a senator’s wife? I like to think you killed a man. It’s the
romantic in me.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: It was a combination of all three.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: And what in heaven’s name brought you to
Casablanca?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: My health. I came to Casablanca for the
waters.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Waters? What waters? We’re in the
desert.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I was misinformed.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Huh!</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Excuse me, Monsieur Rick, but a gentleman
inside has won twenty thousand francs. The cashier would like some
money.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Well, I’ll get it from the safe.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: I am so upset, Monsieur Rick. You know I can’t
understand –</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: – Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that happen
all the time.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: I’m awfully sorry.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Rick, there’s going to be some excitement
here tonight. We are going to make an arrest in your cafe.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: What, again?</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: This is no ordinary arrest. A murderer, no
less.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: If you are thinking of warning him, don’t
put yourself out. He cannot possibly escape.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I stick my neck out for nobody.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: A wise foreign policy.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: You know, Rick, we could have made this
arrest earlier in the evening at the Blue Parrot, but out of my high
regard for you we are staging it here. It will amuse your customers.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Our entertainment is enough.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Rick, we are to have an important guest
tonight, Major Strasser of the Third Reich, no less. We want him to be
here when we make the arrest. A little demonstration of the efficiency
of my administration.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I see. And what’s Strasser doing here? He
certainly didn’t come all the way to Casablanca to witness a
demonstration of your efficiency.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Perhaps not.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Here you are.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: It shall not happen again, Monsieur.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: That’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Louis, you’ve got something on your mind. Why
don’t you spill it?</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: How observant you are. As a matter of fact,
I wanted to give you a word of advice.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Yeah? Have a brandy?</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Thank you. Rick, there are many exit visas
sold in this cafe, but we know that you have never sold one. That is the
reason we permit you to remain open.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I thought it was because we let you win at
roulette.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: That is another reason. There is a man
who’s arrived in Casablanca on his way to America. He will offer a
fortune to anyone who will furnish him with an exit visa.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Yeah? What’s his name?</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Victor Laszlo.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Victor Laszlo?</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Rick, that is the first time I have ever
seen you so impressed.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Well, he’s succeeded in impressing half the
world.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: It is my duty to see that he doesn’t
impress the other half. Rick, Laszlo must never reach America. He stays
in Casablanca.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: It’ll be interesting to see how he
manages.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Manages what?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: His escape.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Oh, but I just told you. –</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: – Stop it. He escaped from a concentration
camp and the Nazis have been chasing him all over Europe.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: This is the end of the chase.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Twenty thousand francs says it isn’t.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Is that a serious offer?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I just paid out twenty. I’d like to get it
back.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Make it ten. I am only a poor corrupt
official.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Done. No matter how clever he is, he still
needs an exit visa, or I should say, two.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Why two?</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: He is traveling with a lady.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: He’ll take one.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: I think not. I have seen the lady. And if
he did not leave her in Marseilles, or in Oran, he certainly won’t leave
her in Casablanca.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Maybe he’s not quite as romantic as you
are.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: It doesn’t matter. There is no exit visa
for him.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Louis, whatever gave you the impression that I
might be interested in helping Laszlo escape?</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Because, my dear Ricky, I suspect that
under that cynical shell you’re at heart a sentimentalist.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Oh, laugh if you will, but I happen to be
familiar with your record. Let me point out just two items. In 1935 you
ran guns to Ethiopia. In 1936, you fought in Spain on the Loyalist
side.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: And got well paid for it on both
occasions.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: The winning side would have paid you much
better.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Maybe. Well, it seems you are determined to
keep Laszlo here.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: I have my orders.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Oh, I see. Gestapo spank.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: My dear Ricky, you overestimate the
influence of the Gestapo. I don’t interfere with them and they don’t
interfere with me. In Casablanca I am master of my fate. I am captain of
my –</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: – Major Strasser is here, sir.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Yeah, you were saying?</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Carl, see that Major Strasser gets a good
table, one close to the ladies.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I have already given him the best, knowing he
is German and would take it anyway.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Take him quietly. Two guards at every
door.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Yes, sir. Everything is ready, sir.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Good evening, gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: Good evening, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>heinze</strong>: Won’t you join us?</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Thank you. It is a pleasure to have you
here, Major.</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: Champagne and a tin of caviar.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: May I recommend Veuve Cliquot ’26, a good
French wine.</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Very well, sir.</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: A very interesting club.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Especially so tonight, Major. In a few
minutes you will see the arrest of the man who murdered your
couriers.</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: I expected no less, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>gendarme</strong>: Monsieur Ugarte?</p>
<p><strong>ugarte</strong>: Oh. Yes?</p>
<p><strong>gendarme</strong>: Will you please come with us.</p>
<p><strong>ugarte</strong>: Certainly. May I first please cash my
chips?</p>
<p><strong>ugarte</strong>: Pretty lucky, huh? Two thousand, please.</p>
<p><strong>cashier</strong>: Two thousand.</p>
<p><strong>ugarte</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>ugarte</strong>: Rick! Rick, help me!</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Don’t be a fool. You can’t get away.</p>
<p><strong>ugarte</strong>: Rick, hide me. Do something! You must help
me, Rick. Do something!</p>
<p><strong>ugarte</strong>: Rick! Rick!</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: Excellent, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>customer</strong>: When they come to get me, Rick, I hope
you’ll be more of a help.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I stick my neck out for nobody.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I’m sorry there was a disturbance, folks, but
it’s all over now. Everything’s all right. Just sit down and have a good
time. Enjoy yourself.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: All right, Sam.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Oh, Rick?</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser of
the Third Reich.</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: How do you do, Mr. Rick?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Oh, how do you do?</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: And you already know Herr Heinze of the
Third Reich.</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: Please join us, Mr. Rick.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: We are very honored tonight, Rick.</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: You repeat “Third Reich” as though you
expected there to be others.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Well, personally, Major, I will take what
comes.</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?
Unofficially, of course.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Make it official, if you like.</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: What is your nationality?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I’m a drunkard.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: That makes Rick a citizen of the world.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I was born in New York City if that’ll help
you any.</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: I understand you came here from Paris at
the time of the occupation.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: There seems to be no secret about that.</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: Are you one of those people who cannot
imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: It’s not particularly my beloved Paris.</p>
<p><strong>heinze</strong>: Can you imagine us in London?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: When you get there, ask me.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Ho, diplomatist!</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: How about New York?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Well, there are certain sections of New York,
Major, that I wouldn’t advise you to try to invade.</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: Aha. Who do you think will win the
war?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I haven’t the slightest idea.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Rick is completely neutral about
everything. And that takes in the field of women, too.</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: You weren’t always so carefully neutral.
We have a complete dossier on you.</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: “Richard Blaine, American. Age, thirty-
seven. Cannot return to his country.”</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: The reason is a little vague. We also know
what you did in Paris, Mr. Blaine, and also we know why you left
Paris.</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: Don’t worry. We are not going to broadcast
it.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Are my eyes really brown?</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: You will forgive my curiosity, Mr. Blaine.
The point is, an enemy of the Reich has come to Casablanca and we are
checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: My interest in whether Victor Laszlo stays or
goes is purely a sporting one.</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: In this case, you have no sympathy for the
fox, huh?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Not particularly. I understand the point of
view of the hound, too.</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: Victor Laszlo published the foulest lies
in the Prague newspapers until the very day we marched in, and even
after that he continued to print scandal sheets in a cellar.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Of course, one must admit he has great
courage.</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: I admit he is very clever. Three times he
slipped through our fingers. In Paris he continued his activities. We
intend not to let it happen again.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: You’ll excuse me, gentlemen. Your business is
politics. Mine is running a saloon.</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: Good evening, Mr. Blaine.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: You see, Major, you have nothing to worry
about Rick.</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: Perhaps.</p>
<p><strong>headwaiter</strong>: Yes, Monsieur?</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: I reserved a table. Victor Laszlo.</p>
<p><strong>headwaiter</strong>: Yes, Monsieur Laszlo. Right this
way.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Two cointreaux, please.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Yes, Monsieur.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: I saw no one of Ugarte’s description.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Victor, I, I feel somehow we shouldn’t stay
here.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: If we would walk out so soon, it would only
call attention to us. Perhaps Ugarte’s in some other part of the
cafe.</p>
<p><strong>berger</strong>: Excuse me, but you look like a couple who
are on their way to America.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>berger</strong>: You will find a market there for this ring.
I am forced to sell it at a great sacrifice.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Thank you, but I hardly think –</p>
<p><strong>berger</strong>: – Then perhaps for the lady. The ring is
quite unique.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Oh, yes, I’m very interested.</p>
<p><strong>berger</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: What is your name?</p>
<p><strong>berger</strong>: Berger, Norwegian, and at your service,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Victor…</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: I’ll meet you in a few minutes at the bar. I
do not think we want to buy the ring. But thank you for showing it to
us.</p>
<p><strong>berger</strong>: Such a bargain. But that is your
decision?</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: I’m sorry. It is.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: I am Captain Renault, Prefect of
Police.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Yes. What is it you want?</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and
wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a
visitor.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Thank you. I hope you’ll forgive me,
Captain, but the present French administration has not always been so
cordial. May I present Miss Ilsa Lund?</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: I was informed you were the most beautiful
woman ever to visit Casablanca. That was a gross understatement.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: You are very kind.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Won’t you join us?</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: If you will permit me. Oh, Emil. Please, a
bottle of your best champagne, and put it on my bill.</p>
<p><strong>emil</strong>: Very well, sir.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: No, Captain, please.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: No. Please, Monsieur, it is a little game
we play. They put it on the bill, I tear the bill up. It is very
convenient.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Captain, the boy who is playing the piano,
somewhere I have seen him.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Sam?</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: He came from Paris with Rick.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Rick? Who’s he?</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Mademoiselle, you are in Rick’s and Rick is
–</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: – Is what?</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Well, Mademoiselle, he’s the kind of a man
that, well, if I were a woman and I… were not around, I should be in
love with Rick. But what a fool I am talking to a beautiful woman about
another man.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Excuse me. Ah, Major. Mademoiselle Lund,
Monsieur Laszlo, may I present Major Heinrich Strasser.</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: How do you do. This is a pleasure I have
long looked forward to.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: I’m sure you’ll excuse me if I am not
gracious, but you see, Major Strasser, I’m a Czechoslovakian.</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: You were a Czechoslovakian. Now you are a
subject of the German Reich!</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: I’ve never accepted that privilege, and I’m
now on French soil.</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: I should like to discuss some matters
arising from your presence on French soil.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: This is hardly the time or the place.</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: Then we shall state another time and
another place. Tomorrow at ten in the Prefect’s office, with
Mademoiselle.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Captain Renault, I am under your authority.
Is it your order that we come to your office?</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Let us say that it is my request. That is a
much more pleasant word.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Very well.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Mademoiselle.</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: Mademoiselle.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: A very clever tactical retreat, Major.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: This time they really mean to stop me.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Victor, I’m afraid for you.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: We have been in difficult places before,
haven’t we?</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: I must find out what Berger knows.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Be careful.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: I will, don’t worry.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Mr. Berger, the ring, could I see it
again?</p>
<p><strong>berger</strong>: Yes, Monsieur.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: A champagne cocktail, please.</p>
<p><strong>berger</strong>: I recognize you from the news photographs,
Monsieur Laszlo.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: In a concentration camp, one is apt to lose
a little weight.</p>
<p><strong>berger</strong>: We read five times that you were killed in
five different places.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: As you see, it was true every single time.
Thank heaven I found you, Berger. I am looking for a man by the name of
Ugarte. He is supposed to help me.</p>
<p><strong>berger</strong>: Ugarte cannot even help himself, Monsieur.
He is under arrest for murder. He was arrested here tonight.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>berger</strong>: But we who are still free will do all we
can. We are organized, Monsieur, underground like everywhere else.
Tomorrow night there is a meeting at the Caverne du Bois. If you would
come…</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Will you ask the piano player to come over
here, please?</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Very well, Mademoiselle.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: How’s the jewelry business, Berger?</p>
<p><strong>berger</strong>: Er, not so good. May I have my check,
please?</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Too bad you weren’t here earlier, Monsieur
Laszlo. We had quite a bit of excitement this evening, didn’t we,
Berger?</p>
<p><strong>berger</strong>: Er, yes. Excuse me, gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: My bill.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: No. Two champagne cocktails, please.</p>
<p><strong>sacha</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Hello, Sam.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Hello, Miss Ilsa. I never expected to see you
again.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: It’s been a long time.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Yes, ma’am. A lot of water under the
bridge.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Some of the old songs, Sam.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Yes, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Where is Rick?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I don’t know. I ain’t seen him all night.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: When will he be back?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Not tonight no more. He ain’t coming. Uh, he
went home.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Does he always leave so early?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Oh, he never… well… he’s got a girl up at the
Blue Parrot. He goes up there all the time.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: You used to be a much better liar, Sam.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa. You’re bad luck to
him.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Play it once, Sam, for old time’s sake.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I don’t know what you mean, Miss Ilsa.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Play it, Sam. Play “As Time Goes By.”</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Oh I can’t remember it, Miss Ilsa. I’m a little
rusty on it.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: I’ll hum it for you.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Sing it, Sam.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You must remember this, A kiss is just a kiss,
A sigh is just a sigh, The fundamental things apply, As time goes
by.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: And when two lovers woo, They both say I love
you, On that you can rely, No matter what the future brings, As time
goes by.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Sam, I thought I told you never to play…</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Well, you were asking about Rick and here
he is. Mademoiselle, may I present –</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: – Hello, Ilsa.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Hello, Rick.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Oh, you’ve already met Rick,
Mademoiselle?</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Well then, perhaps you also —</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: – This is Mr. Laszlo.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: How do you do?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: How do you do?</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: One hears a great deal about Rick in
Casablanca.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Won’t you join us for a drink?</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Oh, no, Rick never –</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: – Thanks. I will.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Well! A precedent is being broken. Er,
Emil!</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: This is a very interesting cafe. I
congratulate you.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: And I congratulate you.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Your work.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Thank you. I try.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: We all try. You succeed.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: I can’t get over you two. She was asking
about you earlier, Rick, in a way that made me extremely jealous.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: I wasn’t sure you were the same. Let’s see,
the last time we met –</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: – It was “La Belle Aurore.”</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: How nice. You remembered. But of course, that
was the day the Germans marched into Paris.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Not an easy day to forget.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I remember every detail. The Germans wore
gray, you wore blue.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Yes. I put that dress away. When the Germans
march out, I’ll wear it again.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Ricky, you’re becoming quite human. I
suppose we have to thank you for that, Mademoiselle.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Ilsa, I don’t wish to be the one to say it,
but it’s late.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: So it is. And we have a curfew here in
Casablanca. It would never do for the Chief of Police to be found
drinking after hours and have to fine himself.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: I hope we didn’t overstay our welcome.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Not at all.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Your check, sir.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Oh, it’s my party.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Another precedent gone. This has been a
very interesting evening. I’ll call you a cab. Gasoline rationing, time
of night.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: We’ll come again.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Any time.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Say goodnight to Sam for me.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I will.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: There’s still nobody in the world who can play
“As Time Goes By” like Sam.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: He hasn’t played it in a long time.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: A very puzzling fellow, this Rick. What sort
is he?</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Oh, I really can’t say, though I saw him quite
often in Paris.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Tomorrow at ten at the Prefect’s
office.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: We’ll be there.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Boss.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Boss!</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Boss, ain’t you going to bed?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Not right now.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Ain’t you planning on going to bed in the near
future?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You ever going to bed?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Well, I ain’t sleepy either.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Good. Then have a drink.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: No. Not me, boss.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Then don’t have a drink.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Boss, let’s get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: No, sir. I’m waiting for a lady.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Please, boss, let’s go. Ain’t nothing but
trouble for you here.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: She’s coming back. I know she’s coming
back.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: We’ll take the car and drive all night. We’ll
get drunk. We’ll go fishing and stay away until she’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Shut up and go home, will you?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: No, sir. I’m staying right here.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: They grab Ugarte and she walks in. Well,
that’s the way it goes. One in, one out. Sam?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Yeah, boss?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Sam, if it’s December 1941 in Casablanca, what
time is it in New York?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Uh, my watch stopped.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I bet they’re asleep in New York. I’ll bet
they’re asleep all over America.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all
the world, she walks into mine.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: What’s that you’re playing?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Just a little something of my own.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Well, stop it. You know what I want to
hear.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: No, I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: You played it for her and you can play it for
me.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Well, I don’t think I can remember it.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: If she can stand it, I can. Play it!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Yes, boss.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Who are you really? And what were you before?
What did you do and what did you think? Huh?</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: We said “no questions.”</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Here’s looking at you, kid.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: A franc for your thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: In America they’d bring only a penny. I guess
that’s about all they’re worth.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: I’m willing to be overcharged. Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: And I was wondering.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Why I’m so lucky. Why I should find you
waiting for me to come along.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Why there is no other man in my life?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Uh huh.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: That’s easy. There was. He’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I’m sorry for asking. I forgot we said “no
questions.”</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Well, only one answer can take care of all our
questions.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Nothing can stop them now.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Richard, they’ll find out your record. It
won’t be safe for you here.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I’m on their blacklist already, their roll of
honor.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Henri wants us to finish this bottle and then
three more. He says he’ll water his garden with champagne before he’ll
let the Germans drink any of it.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: This sort of takes the sting out of being
occupied, doesn’t it, Mr. Richard?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: You said it! Here’s looking at you, kid.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: My German’s a little rusty.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: It’s the Gestapo. They say they expect to be
in Paris tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: With the whole world crumbling, we pick this
time to fall in love.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Yeah. It’s pretty bad timing. Where were you,
say, ten years ago?</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Ten years ago? Let’s see… …Yes. I was having a
brace put on my teeth. Where were you?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Looking for a job.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Was that cannon fire, or is it my heart
pounding?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Ah, that’s the new German 77. And judging by
the sound, only about thirty-five miles away.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: And getting closer every minute. Here. Drink
up. We’ll never finish the other three.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: The Germans’ll be here pretty soon now, and
they’ll come looking for you. And don’t forget there’s a price on your
head.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I left a note in my apartment. They’ll know
where to find me.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Strange. I know so very little about you.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I know very little about you, just the fact
that you had your teeth straightened.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: But be serious, darling. You are in danger and
you must leave Paris.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: No, no, no, no. We must leave.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Yes, of course, we –</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: – The train for Marseilles leaves at five
o’clock. I’ll pick you up at your hotel at four-thirty.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: No, no. Not at my hotel. I, uh, I have things
to do in the city before I leave. I’ll meet you at the station, huh?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: All right. At a quarter to five. Say, why
don’t we get married in Marseilles?</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: That’s too far ahead to plan.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Yes, I guess it is a little too far ahead.
Well, let’s see. What about the engineer? Why can’t he marry us on the
train?</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Oh, darling!</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Well, why not? The captain on a ship can. It
doesn’t seem fair that… Hey, hey, what’s wrong, kid?</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: I love you so much, and I hate this war so
much. Oh, it’s a crazy world. Anything can happen. If you shouldn’t get
away, I mean, if, if something should keep us apart, wherever they put
you and wherever I’ll be, I want you to know…</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Kiss me. Kiss me as if it were the last
time.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Where is she? Have you seen her?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: No, Mr. Richard. I can’t find her.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: That’s the last call, Mr. Richard, do you hear
me? Come on, Mr. Richard. Let’s get out of here. Come on, Mr. Richard,
come on.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Rick, I have to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Oh. I saved my first drink to have with you.
Here.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: No. No, Rick. Not tonight.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Especially tonight.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Why did you have to come to Casablanca? There
are other places.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: I wouldn’t have come if I had known that you
were here. Believe me, Rick, it’s true. I didn’t know.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: It’s funny about your voice, how it hasn’t
changed. I can still hear it. “Richard dear, I’ll go with you any place.
We’ll get on a train together and never stop.”</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Please don’t. Don’t, Rick. I can understand
how you feel.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Huh! You understand how I feel. How long was
it we had, honey?</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: I didn’t count the days.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Well, I did. Every one of them. Mostly I
remember the last one. A wow finish. A guy standing on a station
platform in the rain with a comical look on his face, because his
insides had been kicked out.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Can I tell you a story, Rick?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Has it got a wow finish?</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: I don’t know the finish yet.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Well, go on, tell it. Maybe one will come to
you as you go along.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: It’s about a girl who had just come to Paris
from her home in Oslo. At the house of some friends she met a man about
whom she’d heard her whole life, a very great and courageous man. He
opened up for her a whole beautiful world full of knowledge and thoughts
and ideals. Everything she knew or ever became was because of him. And
she looked up to him and worshipped him with a feeling she supposed was
love.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Yes, that’s very pretty. I heard a story once.
As a matter of fact, I’ve heard a lot of stories in my time. They went
along with the sound of a tinny piano playing in the parlor downstairs,
“Mister, I met a man once when I was a kid,” it’d always begin. Huh. I
guess neither one of our stories was very funny. Tell me, who was it you
left me for? Was it Laszlo, or were there others in between? Or aren’t
you the kind that tells?</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the
letters of transit with Mr. Blaine. I would suggest you search the cafe
immediately and thoroughly.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: If Rick has the letters, he’s much too
smart to let you find them there.</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: You give him credit for too much
cleverness. My impression was that he’s just another blundering
American.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: But we mustn’t underestimate American
blundering. I was with them when they “blundered” into Berlin in
1918.</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: As to Laszlo, we want him watched
twenty-four hours a day.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: It may interest you to know that at this
very moment he is on his way here.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: There’s nothing we can do.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: I am delighted to see you both. Did you
have a good night’s rest?</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: I slept very well.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: That’s strange. Nobody is supposed to sleep
well in Casablanca.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: May we proceed with the business?</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: With pleasure. Won’t you sit down?</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: Very well, Herr Laszlo, we will not mince
words. You are an escaped prisoner of the Reich. So far you have been
fortunate enough in eluding us. You have reached Casablanca. It is my
duty to see that you stay in Casablanca.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Whether or not you succeed is, of course,
problematical.</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: Not at all. Captain Renault’s signature is
necessary on every exit visa. Captain, would you think it is possible
that Herr Laszlo will receive a visa?</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: I am afraid not. My regrets, Monsieur.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Well, perhaps I shall like it in
Casablanca.</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: And Mademoiselle?</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: You needn’t be concerned about me.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Is that all you wish to tell us?</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: Don’t be in such a hurry. You have all the
time in the world. You may be in Casablanca indefinitely… or you may
leave for Lisbon tomorrow, on one condition.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: And that is?</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: You know the leaders of the underground
movement in Paris, in Prague, in Brussels, in Amsterdam, in Oslo, in
Belgrade, in Athens.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Even in Berlin.</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: Yes, even in Berlin. If you will furnish
me with their names and their exact whereabouts, you will have your visa
in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: And the honor of having served the Third
Reich.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: I was in a German concentration camp for a
year. That’s honor enough for a lifetime.</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: You will give us the names?</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: If I didn’t give them to you in a
concentration camp where you had more “persuasive methods” at your
disposal, I certainly won’t give them to you now.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: And what if you track down these men and
kill them? What if you murdered all of us? From every corner of Europe,
hundreds, thousands, would rise to take our places. Even Nazis can’t
kill that fast.</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for
eloquence which I can now understand. But in one respect you are
mistaken. You said the enemies of the Reich could all be replaced, but
there is one exception. No one could take your place in the event
anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to
escape.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: You won’t dare to interfere with me here.
This is still unoccupied France. Any violation of neutrality would
reflect on Captain Renault.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Monsieur, insofar as it is in my power
–</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: – Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: By the way, Monsieur, last night you
evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: I believe you have a message for him?</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Nothing important, but may I speak to him
now?</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: You would find the conversation a trifle
one-sided. Signor Ugarte is dead.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: I am making out the report now. We haven’t
quite decided whether he committed suicide or died trying to escape.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Are you quite finished with us?</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: For the time being.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Good day.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Undoubtedly their next step will be to the
black market.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Excuse me, Captain. Another visa problem
has come up.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Show her in.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>native</strong>: I’m sorry, Monsieur, we would have to handle
the police. This is a job for Signor Ferrari.</p>
<p><strong>frenchman</strong>: Ferrari?</p>
<p><strong>native</strong>: It can be most helpful to know Signor
Ferrari. He pretty near has a monopoly on the black market here. You
will find him over there at the Blue Parrot.</p>
<p><strong>frenchman</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>ferrari</strong>: There, don’t be too downhearted. Perhaps
you can come to terms with Captain Renault.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: Thank you very much, Signor.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Hello, Ferrari.</p>
<p><strong>ferrari</strong>: Ah, good morning, Rick.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I see the bus is in. I’ll take my shipment
with me.</p>
<p><strong>ferrari</strong>: No hurry. I’ll have it sent over. Have a
drink with me.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I never drink in the morning. And every time
you send my shipment over, it’s always just a little bit short.</p>
<p><strong>ferrari</strong>: Carrying charges, my boy, carrying charges.
Here, sit down. There’s something I want to talk over with you,
anyhow.</p>
<p><strong>ferrari</strong>: The bourbon. The news about Ugarte upset me
very much.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: You’re a fat hypocrite. You don’t feel any
sorrier for Ugarte than I do.</p>
<p><strong>ferrari</strong>: Of course not. What upsets me is the fact
that Ugarte is dead and no one knows where those letters of transit
are.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Practically no one.</p>
<p><strong>ferrari</strong>: If I could lay my hands on those letters, I
could make a fortune.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: So could I. And I’m a poor businessman.</p>
<p><strong>ferrari</strong>: I have a proposition for whoever has those
letters. I will handle the entire transaction, get rid of the letters,
take all the risk, for a small percentage.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: And the carrying charges?</p>
<p><strong>ferrari</strong>: Naturally there will be a few incidental
expenses. That is the proposition I have for whoever has those
letters.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I’ll tell him when he comes in.</p>
<p><strong>ferrari</strong>: Rick, I’ll put my cards on the table. I
think you know where those letters are.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Well, you’re in good company. Renault and
Strasser probably think so, too.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: That’s why I came over here to give them a
chance to ransack my place.</p>
<p><strong>ferrari</strong>: Rick, don’t be a fool. Take me into your
confidence. You need a partner.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Excuse me, I’ll be getting back.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Signor Ferrari is the fat gent at the
table.</p>
<p><strong>arab</strong>: You will not find a treasure like this in all
Morocco, Mademoiselle. Only seven hundred francs.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: You’re being cheated.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: It doesn’t matter, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>arab</strong>: Ah, the lady is a friend of Rick’s? For
friends of Rick we have a small discount. Did I say seven hundred
francs? You can have it for two hundred.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I’m sorry I was in no condition to receive you
when you called on me last night.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: It doesn’t matter.</p>
<p><strong>arab</strong>: Ah, for special friends of Rick’s we have a
special discount. One hundred francs.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Your story had me a little confused. Or maybe
it was the bourbon.</p>
<p><strong>arab</strong>: I have some tablecloths, some napkins –</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: – Thank you. I’m really not interested.</p>
<p><strong>arab</strong>: Please, one minute. Wait!</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Why did you come back? To tell me why you ran
out on me at the railway station?</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Well, you can tell me now. I’m reasonably
sober.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: I don’t think I will, Rick.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Why not? After all, I got stuck with a railway
ticket. I think I’m entitled to know.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Last night I saw what has happened to you. The
Rick I knew in Paris, I could tell him. He’d understand. But the one who
looked at me with such hatred… well, I’ll be leaving Casablanca soon and
we’ll never see each other again. We knew very little about each other
when we were in love in Paris. If we leave it that way, maybe we’ll
remember those days and not Casablanca, not last night.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Did you run out on me because you couldn’t
take it? Because you knew what it would be like, hiding from the police,
running away all the time?</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: You can believe that if you want to.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Well, I’m not running away any more. I’m
settled now, above a saloon, it’s true, but… walk up a flight. I’ll be
expecting you.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: All the same, someday you’ll lie to Laszlo.
You’ll be there.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: No, Rick. No, you see, Victor Laszlo is my
husband… and was, even when I knew you in Paris.</p>
<p><strong>ferrari</strong>: I was just telling Monsieur Laszlo that,
unfortunately, I am not able to help him.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: You see, my dear, the word has gone
around.</p>
<p><strong>ferrari</strong>: As leader of all illegal activities in
Casablanca, I am an influential and respected man. It would not be worth
my life to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo. You, however, are a
different matter.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Signor Ferrari thinks it might just be
possible to get an exit visa for you.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: You mean for me to go on alone?</p>
<p><strong>ferrari</strong>: And only alone.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: I will stay here and keep on trying. I’m
sure in a little while –</p>
<p><strong>ferrari</strong>: – We might as well be frank, Monsieur. It
will take a miracle to get you out of Casablanca. And the Germans have
outlawed miracles.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: We are only interested in two visas,
Signor.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Please, Ilsa, don’t be hasty.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: No, Victor, no.</p>
<p><strong>ferrari</strong>: You two will want to discuss this. Excuse
me. I’ll be at the bar.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: No, Ilsa, I won’t let you stay here. You
must get to America. And believe me, somehow I will get out and join
you.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: But, Victor, if the situation were different,
if I had to stay and there were only a visa for one, would you take
it?</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Yes, I would.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Yes, I see. When I had trouble getting out of
Lille, why didn’t you leave me there? And when I was sick in Marseilles
and held you up for two weeks and you were in danger every minute of the
time, why didn’t you leave me then?</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: I meant to, but something always held me up.
I love you very much, Ilsa.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Your secret will be safe with me. Ferrari is
waiting for our answer.</p>
<p><strong>ferrari</strong>: Not more than fifty francs though.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: We’ve decided, Signor Ferrari. For the
present we’ll go on looking for two exit visas. Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>ferrari</strong>: Well, good luck. But be careful. You know
you’re being shadowed?</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Of course. It becomes an instinct.</p>
<p><strong>ferrari</strong>: I observe that you in one respect are a
very fortunate man, Monsieur. I am moved to make one more suggestion,
why, I do not know, because it cannot possibly profit me, but, have you
heard about Signor Ugarte and the letters of transit?</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Yes, something.</p>
<p><strong>ferrari</strong>: Those letters were not found on Ugarte when
they arrested him.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Do you know where they are?</p>
<p><strong>ferrari</strong>: Not for sure, Monsieur, but I will venture
to guess that Ugarte left those letters with Monsieur Rick.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Rick?</p>
<p><strong>ferrari</strong>: He is a difficult customer, that Rick. One
never knows what he’ll do or why. But it is worth a chance.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Thank you very much. Good day.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Goodbye, thank you for your coffee, Signor. I
shall miss that when we leave Casablanca.</p>
<p><strong>ferrari</strong>: It was gracious of you to share it with me.
Good day, Mademoiselle, Monsieur.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Good day.</p>
<p><strong>european</strong>: Here’s to you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>tourist</strong>: Er, good luck, yes.</p>
<p><strong>european</strong>: I’d better be going.</p>
<p><strong>tourist</strong>: Er, my check, please.</p>
<p><strong>european</strong>: I have to warn you, sir. I beseech
you…</p>
<p><strong>european</strong>: This is a dangerous place, full of
vultures. Vultures everywhere! Thanks for everything.</p>
<p><strong>tourist</strong>: Er, goodbye, sir.</p>
<p><strong>european</strong>: It has been a pleasure to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>european</strong>: Oh, I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Monsieur Rick, you are getting to be your best
customer.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Well, Ricky. I’m very pleased with you. Now
you’re beginning to live like a Frenchman.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: That was some going-over your men gave my
place this afternoon. We just barely got cleaned up in time to open.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Well, I told Strasser he wouldn’t find the
letters here. But I told my men to be especially destructive. You know
how that impresses Germans? Rick, have you got these letters of
transit?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Louis, are you pro-Vichy or Free French?</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Serves me right for asking a direct
question. The subject is closed.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Well, it looks like you’re a little late.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: So Yvonne’s gone over to the enemy.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Who knows? In her own way she may
constitute an entire second front. I think it’s time for me to flatter
Major Strasser a little. I’ll see you later, Rick.</p>
<p><strong>yvonne</strong>: Sacha!</p>
<p><strong>german officer</strong>: French seventy-fives.</p>
<p><strong>yvonne</strong>: Put up a whole row of them, Sacha… starting
here and ending here.</p>
<p><strong>german officer</strong>: We will begin with two.</p>
<p><strong>french officer</strong>: Say, you, you are not French to go
with a German like this!</p>
<p><strong>yvonne</strong>: What are you butting in for?</p>
<p><strong>french officer</strong>: I am butting in –</p>
<p><strong>yvonne</strong>: – It’s none of your business!</p>
<p><strong>german officer</strong>: No, no, no, no! One minute! What did
you say? Would you kindly repeat it?</p>
<p><strong>french officer</strong>: What I said is none of your
business!</p>
<p><strong>german officer</strong>: I will make it my business!</p>
<p><strong>yvonne</strong>: Stop! I beg of you! I beg of you, stop!</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I don’t like disturbances in my place. Either
lay off politics or get out.</p>
<p><strong>french officer</strong>: Dirty Boche. Someday we’ll have our
revenge!</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: You see, Captain, the situation is not as
much under control as you believe.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: My dear Major, we are trying to cooperate
with your government, but we cannot regulate the feelings of our
people.</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: Captain Renault, are you entirely certain
which side you’re on?</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: I have no conviction, if that’s what you
mean. I blow with the wind, and the prevailing wind happens to be from
Vichy.</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: And if it should change?</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Surely the Reich doesn’t admit that
possibility?</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: We are concerned about more than
Casablanca. We know that every French province in Africa is honeycombed
with traitors waiting for their chance, waiting, perhaps, for a
leader.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: A leader, like Laszlo?</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: Uh, huh. I have been thinking. It is too
dangerous if we let him go. It may be too dangerous if we let him
stay.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: I see what you mean.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I brought you the finest brandy. Only the
employees drink it here.</p>
<p><strong>mr. leuchtag</strong>: Thank you, Carl.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: For Mrs. Leuchtag.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. leuchtag</strong>: Thank you, Carl.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: For Mr. Leuchtag.</p>
<p><strong>mr. leuchtag</strong>: Carl, sit down. Have a brandy with
us.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. leuchtag</strong>: To celebrate our leaving for America
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Thank you very much. I thought you would ask
me, so I brought the good brandy and a third glass.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. leuchtag</strong>: At last the day has came.</p>
<p><strong>mr. leuchtag</strong>: Frau Leuchtag and I are speaking
nothing but English now.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. leuchtag</strong>: So we should feel at home ven ve get
to America.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: A very nice idea.</p>
<p><strong>mr. leuchtag</strong>: To America.</p>
<p><strong>mr. leuchtag</strong>: Liebchen, uh, sweetness heart, what
watch?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. leuchtag</strong>: Ten watch.</p>
<p><strong>mr. leuchtag</strong>: Such much?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Er, you will get along beautifully in America,
huh.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: How’s lady luck treating you? Aw, too bad.
You’ll find him over there.</p>
<p><strong>annina</strong>: Monsieur Rick?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>annina</strong>: Could I speak to you for just a moment,
please?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: How did you get in here? You’re under age.</p>
<p><strong>annina</strong>: I came with Captain Renault.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I should have known.</p>
<p><strong>annina</strong>: My husband is with me, too.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: He is? Well, Captain Renault’s getting
broadminded. Sit down. Will you have a drink?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: No, of course not. Do you mind if I do?</p>
<p><strong>annina</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>annina</strong>: Monsieur Rick, what kind of man is Captain
Renault?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Oh, he’s just like any other man, only more
so.</p>
<p><strong>annina</strong>: No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is his word
–</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: – Now, just a minute. Who told you to ask me
that?</p>
<p><strong>annina</strong>: He did. Captain Renault did.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I thought so. Where’s your husband?</p>
<p><strong>annina</strong>: At the roulette table, trying to win enough
for our exit visa. Well of course, he’s losing.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: How long have you been married?</p>
<p><strong>annina</strong>: Eight weeks. We come from Bulgaria. Oh,
things are very bad there, Monsieur. A devil has the people by the
throat. So, Jan and I, we, we do not want our children to grow up in
such a country.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: So you decided to go to America.</p>
<p><strong>annina</strong>: Yes, but we have not much money, and
traveling is so expensive and difficult. It was much more than we
thought to get here. And then Captain Renault sees us and he is so kind.
He wants to help us.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Yes, I’ll bet.</p>
<p><strong>annina</strong>: He tells me he can give us an exit visa, but
we have no money.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Does he know that?</p>
<p><strong>annina</strong>: Oh, yes.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: And he is still willing to give you a
visa?</p>
<p><strong>annina</strong>: Yes, Monsieur.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: And you want to know –</p>
<p><strong>annina</strong>: – Will he keep his word?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: He always has.</p>
<p><strong>annina</strong>: Oh, Monsieur, you are a man. If someone
loved you very much, so that your happiness was the only thing that she
wanted in the whole world, but she did a bad thing to make certain of
it, could you forgive her?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Nobody ever loved me that much.</p>
<p><strong>annina</strong>: And he never knew, and the girl kept this
bad thing locked in her heart? That would be all right, wouldn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: You want my advice?</p>
<p><strong>annina</strong>: Oh, yes, please.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Go back to Bulgaria.</p>
<p><strong>annina</strong>: Oh, but if you knew what it means to us to
leave Europe, to get to America! Oh, but if Jan should find out! He is
such a boy. In many ways I am so much older than he is.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Yes, well, everybody in Casablanca has
problems. Yours may work out. You’ll excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>annina</strong>: Thank you, Monsieur.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Good evening.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Good evening. You see, here we are
again.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I take that as a great compliment to Sam. I
suppose he means to you Paris of, well, happier days.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: He does. Could we have a table close to
him?</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: And as far away from Major Strasser as
possible.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Well, the geography may be a little difficult
to arrange.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Paul! Table thirty!</p>
<p><strong>headwaiter</strong>: Yes, sir. Right this way, if you
please.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I’ll have Sam play “As Time Goes By.” I
believe that’s your favorite tune.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Two cognacs, please.</p>
<p><strong>croupier</strong>: Do you wish to place another bet, sir?</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: No, no, I guess not.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Have you tried twenty-two tonight? I said,
twenty-two.</p>
<p><strong>croupier</strong>: Twenty-two, black, twenty-two.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Leave it there.</p>
<p><strong>croupier</strong>: Twenty-two, black.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Cash it in and don’t come back.</p>
<p><strong>customer</strong>: Say, are you sure this place is
honest?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Honest! As honest as the day is long!</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: How we doing tonight?</p>
<p><strong>croupier</strong>: Well, a couple of thousand less than I
thought there would be.</p>
<p><strong>annina</strong>: Monsieur Rick, I –</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: – He’s just a lucky guy.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Monsieur Rick, may I get you a cup of
coffee?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: No thanks, Carl.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Monsieur Rick!</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: Captain Renault, may I –</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: – Oh, not here, please. Come to my office
in the morning. We’ll do everything business-like.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: We’ll be there at six.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: I’ll be there at ten. I am very happy for
both of you. Still, it’s very strange that you won.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Well, maybe not so strange. I’ll see you in
the morning.</p>
<p><strong>annina</strong>: Thank you so much, Captain Renault.</p>
<p><strong>sacha</strong>: Boss, you’ve done a beautiful thing.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Go away, you crazy Russian!</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: As I suspected, you’re a rank
sentimentalist.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Yeah? Why?</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Why do you interfere with my little
romances?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Put it down as a gesture to love.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Well, I forgive you this time. But I’ll be
in tomorrow night with a breathtaking blonde, and it will make me very
happy if she loses. Uh huh!</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Monsieur Blaine, I wonder if I could talk to
you?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Well, isn’t there some other place? It’s
rather confidential, what I have to say.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: My office.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: You must know it’s very important I get out
of Casablanca. It’s my privilege to be one of the leaders of a great
movement. You know what I have been doing. You know what it means to the
work, to the lives of thousands and thousands of people that I be free
to reach America and continue my work.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I’m not interested in politics. The problems
of the world are not in my department. I’m a saloon keeper.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: My friends in the underground tell me that
you have quite a record. You ran guns to Ethiopia. You fought against
the fascists in Spain.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: What of it?</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Isn’t it strange that you always happened to
be fighting on the side of the underdog?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Yes. I found that a very expensive hobby, too.
But then I never was much of a businessman.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Are you enough of a businessman to
appreciate an offer of a hundred thousand francs?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I appreciate it, but I don’t accept it.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: I’ll raise it to two hundred thousand.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: My friend, you could make it a million francs,
or three, my answer would still be the same.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: There must be some reason why you won’t let
me have them.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: There is. I suggest that you ask your
wife.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: I beg your pardon?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I said, ask your wife.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: My wife?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Play the Marseillaise! Play it!</p>
<p><strong>yvonne</strong>: Vive La France! Vive la democracie!</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: Vive La France! Vive la democracie!</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: You see what I mean? If Laszlo’s presence
in a cafe can inspire this unfortunate demonstration, what more will his
presence in Casablanca bring on? I advise that this place be shut up at
once.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: But everybody’s having such a good
time.</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: Yes, much too good a time. The place is to
be closed.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: But I have no excuse to close it.</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: Find one.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Everybody is to leave here immediately!
This cafe is closed until further notice! Clear the room at once!</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: How can you close me up? On what grounds?</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: I am shocked, shocked to find that gambling
is going on in here!</p>
<p><strong>croupier</strong>: Your winnings, sir.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Oh. Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Everybody out at once!</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: Mademoiselle, after this disturbance it is
not safe for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: This morning you implied it was not safe for
him to leave Casablanca.</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: That is also true, except for one
destination, to return to occupied France.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Occupied France?</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: What value is that? You may recall what German
guarantees have been worth in the past.</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: There are only two other alternatives for
him.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: What are they?</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: It is possible the French authorities will
find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: And the other alternative?</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: My dear Mademoiselle, perhaps you have
already observed that in Casablanca, human life is cheap. Good night,
Mademoiselle.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: What happened with Rick?</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: We’ll discuss it later.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Our faithful friend is still there.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Victor, please, don’t go to the underground
meeting tonight.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: I must. Besides, it isn’t often that a man
has a chance to display heroics before his wife.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Don’t joke. After Major Strasser’s warning
tonight, I am frightened.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: To tell you the truth, I am frightened too.
Shall I remain here in our hotel room hiding, or shall I carry on the
best I can?</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Whatever I’d say, you’d carry on. Victor, why
don’t you tell me about Rick? What did you find out?</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Apparently he has the letters.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: But no intention of selling them. One would
think if sentiment wouldn’t persuade him, money would.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Did he give any reason?</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: He suggested I ask you.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Ask me?</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Yes. He said, “Ask your wife.” I don’t know
why he said that.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Well, our friend outside will think we’ve
retired by now. I’ll be going in a few minutes.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Ilsa, I –</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: – Yes?</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: When I was in the concentration camp, were
you lonely in Paris?</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Yes, Victor, I was.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: I know how it is to be lonely. Is there
anything you wish to tell me?</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: No, Victor, there isn’t.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: I love you very much, my dear.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Yes, Yes I know. Victor, whatever I do, will
you believe that I, that –</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: – You don’t even have to say it. I’ll
believe. Goodnight, dear.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Victor!</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Be careful.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Of course, I’ll be careful.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Well, you are in pretty good shape, Herr
Rick.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: How long can I afford to stay closed?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Oh, two weeks, maybe three.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Maybe I won’t have to. A bribe has worked
before. In the meantime, everybody stays on salary.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Oh, thank you, Herr Rick. Sacha will be happy
to hear it. I owe him money.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Now you finish locking up, will you, Carl?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I will. Then I am going to the meeting of the
–</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: – Don’t tell me where you’re going.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I won’t.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Goodnight, Monsieur Rick.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: How did you get in?</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: The stairs from the street.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I told you this morning you’d come around, but
this is a little ahead of schedule. Well, won’t you sit down?</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Richard, I had to see you.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: You use “Richard” again? We’re back in
Paris.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Your unexpected visit isn’t connected by any
chance with the letters of transit? It seems that as long as I have
those letters I’ll never be lonely.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: You can ask any price you want, but you must
give me those letters.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I went through all that with your husband.
It’s no deal.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: I know how you feel about me, but I’m asking
you to put your feelings aside for something more important.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Do I have to hear again what a great man your
husband is? What an important cause he’s fighting for?</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: It was your cause, too. In your own way, you
were fighting for the same thing.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I’m not fighting for anything anymore, except
myself. I’m the only cause I’m interested in.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Richard, Richard, we loved each other once. If
those days meant anything at all to you –</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: – I wouldn’t bring up Paris if I were you.
It’s poor salesmanship.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Please. Please listen to me. If you knew what
really happened, if you only knew the truth –</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: – I wouldn’t believe you, no matter what you
told me. You’d say anything now to get what you want.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: You want to feel sorry for yourself, don’t
you? With so much at stake, all you can think of is your own feelings.
One woman has hurt you, and you take revenge on the rest of the world.
You’re a, you’re a coward, and a weakling.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: No. Oh, Richard, I’m sorry. I’m sorry, but,
but you, you are our last hope. If you don’t help us, Victor Laszlo will
die in Casablanca.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: What of it? I’m going to die in Casablanca.
It’s a good spot for it.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Now if you –</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: – All right. I tried to reason with you. I
tried everything. Now I want those letters. Get them for me.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I don’t have to. I’ve got them right here.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Put them on the table.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: For the last time, put them on the table.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: If Laszlo and the cause mean so much to you,
you won’t stop at anything. All right, I’ll make it easier for you.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Go ahead and shoot. You’ll be doing me a
favor.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Richard, I tried to stay away. I thought I
would never see you again, that you were out of my life.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: The day you left, if you knew what I went
through! If you knew how much I loved you, how much I still love
you!</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: And then?</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: It wasn’t long after we were married that
Victor went back to Czechoslovakia. They needed him in Prague, but there
the Gestapo were waiting for him. Just a two-line item in the paper:
“Victor Laszlo apprehended. Sent to concentration camp.” I was frantic.
For months I tried to get word. Then it came. He was dead, shot trying
to escape. I was lonely. I had nothing. Not even hope. Then I met
you.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Why weren’t you honest with me? Why did you
keep your marriage a secret?</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Oh, it wasn’t my secret, Richard. Victor
wanted it that way. Not even our closest friends knew about our
marriage. That was his way of protecting me. I knew so much about his
work, and if the Gestapo found out I was his wife it would be dangerous
for me and for those working with me.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: When did you first find out he was alive?</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Just before you and I were to leave Paris
together. A friend came and told me that Victor was alive. They were
hiding him in a freight car on the outskirts of Paris. He was sick, he
needed me. I wanted to tell you, but I, I didn’t care. I knew, I knew
you wouldn’t have left Paris, and the Gestapo would have caught you. So
I… well, well, you know the rest.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Huh. But it’s still a story without an ending.
What about now?</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Now? I don’t know. I know that I’ll never have
the strength to leave you again.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: And Laszlo?</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Oh, you’ll help him now, Richard, won’t you?
You’ll see that he gets out? Then he’ll have his work, all that he’s
been living for.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: All except one. He won’t have you.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: I can’t fight it anymore. I ran away from you
once. I can’t do it again. Oh, I don’t know what’s right any longer.
You’ll have to think for both of us, for all of us.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: All right, I will. Here’s looking at you,
kid.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: I wish I didn’t love you so much.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I think we lost them.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Yes. I’m afraid they caught some of the
others.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Come inside. Come.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Come inside. I will help you. Come in
here.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I will give you some water.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Carl, what happened?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: The police break up our meeting. Herr Rick! We
escaped in the last moment.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Come up here a minute.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yes, I come.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I want you to turn out the light in the rear
entrance. It might attract the police.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: But Sacha always puts out that light –</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: – Tonight he forgot.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yes, I come, I will do it.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I want you to take Miss Lund home.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: It’s nothing. Just a little cut. We had to
get through a window.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Well, this might come in handy.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Had a close one, eh?</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Yes, rather.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Don’t you sometimes wonder if it’s worth all
this? I mean what you’re fighting for?</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: We might as well question why we breathe. If
we stop breathing, we’ll die. If we stop fighting our enemies, the world
will die.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: What of it? Then it’ll be out of it’s
misery.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: You know how you sound, Monsieur Blaine?
Like a man who’s trying to convince himself of something he doesn’t
believe in his heart. Each of us has a destiny, for good or for
evil.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Yes, I get the point.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: I wonder if you do. I wonder if you know
that you’re trying to escape from yourself and that you’ll never
succeed.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: You seem to know all about my destiny.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: I know a good deal more about you than you
suspect. I know, for instance, that you are in love with a woman. It is
perhaps strange that we both should be in love with the same woman. The
first evening I came here in this cafe, I knew there was something
between you and Ilsa. Since no one is to blame, I, I demand no
explanation. I ask only one thing. You won’t give me the letters of
transit. All right. But I want my wife to be safe. I ask you as a favor
to use the letters to take her away from Casablanca.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: You love her that much?</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Apparently you think of me only as the
leader of a cause. Well, I am also a human being.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Yes, I love her that much.</p>
<p><strong>french officer</strong>: Mr. Laszlo?</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>french officer</strong>: You will come with us. We have a
warrant for your arrest.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: On what charge?</p>
<p><strong>french officer</strong>: Captain Renault will discuss that
with you later.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: It seems that destiny has taken a hand.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: But you haven’t any actual proof, and you know
it. This isn’t Germany or occupied France. All you can do is fine him a
few thousand francs and give him thirty days. You might as well let him
go now.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Ricky, I’d advise you not to be too
interested in what happens to Laszlo. If by any chance you were to help
him escape –</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: – What makes you think I’d stick my neck out
for Laszlo?</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Because one, you’ve bet ten thousand francs
he’d escape. Two, you have the letters of transit, now don’t bother to
deny it. And, well, you might do it simply because you don’t like
Strasser’s looks. As a matter of fact, I don’t like him either.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Well, they’re all excellent reasons.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Don’t count too much on my friendship,
Ricky. In this matter I’m powerless. Besides, I might lose ten thousand
francs.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: You’re not very subtle, but you are effective.
I, I get the point. Yes, I have the letters, but I intend using them
myself. I’m leaving Casablanca on tonight’s plane, the last plane.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: And I’m taking a friend with me. One you’ll
appreciate.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: What friend?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Ilsa Lund. That ought to put your mind to rest
about my helping Laszlo escape. The last man I want to see in
America.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: You didn’t come here to tell me this. You
have the letters of transit. You can fill in your name and hers and
leave any time you please. Why are you interested in what happens to
Laszlo?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I’m not. But I am interested in what happens
to Ilsa and me. We have a legal right to go, that’s true. But people
have been held in Casablanca in spite of their legal rights.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: What makes you think we want to hold
you?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Ilsa is Laszlo’s wife. She probably knows
things that Strasser would like to know. Louis, I’ll make a deal with
you. Instead of this petty charge you have against him, you can get
something really big, something that would chuck him in a concentration
camp for years. That would be quite a feather in your cap, wouldn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: It certainly would. Germany… Vichy would be
very grateful.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Then release him. You be at my place a half
hour before the plane leaves.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I’ll arrange to have Laszlo come there to pick
up the letters of transit, and that’ll give you the criminal grounds on
which to make the arrest. You get him, and we get away. To the Germans
that last will be just a minor annoyance.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: There’s still something about this business
I don’t quite understand. Miss Lund, she’s very beautiful, yes, but you
were never interested in any woman.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Well, she isn’t just any woman.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: I see. How do I know you’ll keep your end
of the bargain?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I’ll make the arrangements right now with
Laszlo in the visitor’s pen.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Ricky, I’m going to miss you. Apparently
you’re the only one in Casablanca who has even less scruples than I.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Oh, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Go ahead, Ricky.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: And by the way, call off your watchdogs when
you let him go. I don’t want them around this afternoon. I’m taking no
chances, Louis, not even with you.</p>
<p><strong>ferrari</strong>: Shall we draw up the papers, or is our
handshake good enough?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: It’s certainly not good enough. But since I’m
in a hurry, it’ll have to do.</p>
<p><strong>ferrari</strong>: Ah, to get out of Casablanca and go to
America! You’re a lucky man.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Oh, by the way, my agreement with Sam’s always
been that he gets twenty- five percent of the profits. That still
goes.</p>
<p><strong>ferrari</strong>: Hmmm. I happen to know that he gets ten
percent. But he’s worth twenty- five.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: And Abdul and Carl and Sacha, they stay with
the place, or I don’t sell.</p>
<p><strong>ferrari</strong>: Of course they stay. Rick’s wouldn’t be
Rick’s without them.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Well, so long.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Don’t forget, you owe Rick’s a hundred cartons
of American cigarettes.</p>
<p><strong>ferrari</strong>: I shall remember to pay it… to myself.</p>
<p><strong>closed</strong>: By Order of the Prefect of Police.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: You’re late.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: I was informed just as Laszlo was about to
leave the hotel, so I knew I’d be on time.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I thought I asked you to tie up your
watchdogs.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Oh, he won’t be followed here.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: You know, this place will never be the same
without you, Ricky.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Yes, I know what you mean, but I’ve already
spoken to Ferrari. You’ll still win at roulette.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Is everything ready?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I have the letters right here.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Tell me, when we searched the place, where
were they?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Sam’s piano.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Serves me right for not being musical.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Oh. Here they are. You’d better wait in my
office.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Richard, Victor thinks I’m leaving with him.
Haven’t you told him?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: No, not yet.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: But it’s all right, isn’t it? You were able to
arrange everything?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Everything is quite all right.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Oh, Rick!</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: We’ll tell him at the airport. The less time
to think, the easier for all of us. Please trust me.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Yes, I will.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Monsieur Blaine, I don’t know how to thank
you.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Oh, save it. We’ve still lots of things to
do.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: I brought the money, Monsieur Blaine.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Keep it. You’ll need it in America.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: But we made a deal.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Oh, never mind about that. You won’t have any
trouble in Lisbon, will you?</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: No. It’s all arranged.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Good. I’ve got the letters right here, all
made out in blank.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: All you have to do is fill in the
signatures.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Victor Laszlo!</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Victor Laszlo, you are under arrest… on a
charge of accessory to the murder of the couriers from whom these
letters were stolen.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Oh, you are surprised about my friend
Ricky?</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: The explanation is quite simple. Love, it
seems, has triumphed over virtue. Thank –</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: – Not so fast, Louis. Nobody’s going to be
arrested. Not for a while yet.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Have you taken leave of your senses?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I have. Sit down over there.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Put that gun down.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Louis, I wouldn’t like to shoot you, but I
will, if you take one more step.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Under the circumstances, I will sit
down.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Keep your hands on the table.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: I suppose you know what you’re doing, but I
wonder if you realize what this means?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I do. We’ve got plenty of time to discuss that
later.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Call off your watch-dogs you said.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Just the same, you call the airport and let me
hear you tell them. And remember, this gun’s pointed right at your
heart.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: That is my least vulnerable spot.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Hello, is this the airport? This is Captain
Renault speaking. There’ll be two letters of transit for the Lisbon
plane. There’s to be no trouble about them. Good.</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: Hello? Hello?</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: My car, quickly!</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Zu Befehl, Herr Major.</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: This is Major Strasser. Have a squad of
police meet me at the airport at once. At once! Do you hear?</p>
<p><strong>orderly</strong>: Hello. Hello, radio tower? Lisbon plane
taking off in ten minutes. East runway. Visibility: one and one half
miles. Light ground fog. Depth of fog: approximately 500. Ceiling:
unlimited. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Louis, have your man go with Mr.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Certainly Rick, anything you say. Find
Mr. Laszlo’s luggage and put it it on the plane.</p>
<p><strong>orderly</strong>: Yes, sir. This way please.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: If you don’t mind, you fill in the names. That
will make it even more official.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: You think of everything, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: And the names are Mr. and Mrs. Victor
Laszlo.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: But why my name, Richard?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Because you’re getting on that plane.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: I don’t understand. What about you?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I’m staying here with him ’til the plane gets
safely away.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: No, Richard, no. What has happened to you?
Last night we said –</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: – Last night we said a great many things. You
said I was to do the thinking for both of us. Well, I’ve done a lot of
it since then and it all adds up to one thing. You’re getting on that
plane with Victor where you belong.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: But Richard, no, I, I –</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: – You’ve got to listen to me. Do you have any
idea what you’d have to look forward to if you stayed here? Nine chances
out of ten we’d both wind up in a concentration camp. Isn’t that true,
Louis?</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: I’m afraid Major Strasser would insist.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: You’re saying this only to make me go.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I’m saying it because it’s true. Inside of us
we both know you belong with Victor. You’re part of his work, the thing
that keeps him going. If that plane leaves the ground and you’re not
with him, you’ll regret it.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon,
and for the rest of your life.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: But what about us?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: We’ll always have Paris. We didn’t have, we’d
lost it, until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night.</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: And I said I would never leave you.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: And you never will. But I’ve got a job to do,
too. Where I’m going you can’t follow. What I’ve got to do you can’t be
any part of. Ilsa, I’m no good at being noble, but it doesn’t take much
to see that the problems of three little people don’t amount to a hill
of beans in this crazy world. Someday you’ll understand that. Now,
now…</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Here’s looking at you, kid.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Everything in order?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: All except one thing. There’s something you
should know before you leave.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Monsieur Blaine, I don’t ask you to explain
anything.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I’m going to anyway, because it may make a
difference to you later on. You said you knew about Ilsa and me.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: But you didn’t know she was at my place last
night when you were. She came there for the letters of transit. Isn’t
that true, Ilsa?</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: She tried everything to get them, and nothing
worked. She did her best to convince me that she was still in love with
me, but that was all over long ago. For your sake, she pretended it
wasn’t, and I let her pretend.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Here it is.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Thanks. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: And welcome back to the fight. This time I
know our side will win.</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Are you ready Ilsa?</p>
<p><strong>ilsa</strong>: Yes, I’m ready. Goodbye, Rick. God bless
you.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: You better hurry, or you’ll miss that
plane.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Well I was right. You are a
sentimentalist.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Stay where you are. I don’t know what you’re
talking about.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: What you just did for Laszlo, and that
fairy tale that you invented to send Ilsa away with him. I know a little
about women, my friend. She went, but she knew you were lying.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Anyway, thanks for helping me out.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: I suppose you know this isn’t going to be
pleasant for either of us, especially for you. I’ll have to arrest you
of course.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: As soon as the plane goes, Louis.</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: What is the meaning of that phone
call?</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Victor Laszlo is on that plane.</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: Why do you stand here? Why don’t you stop
him?</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Ask Monsieur Rick.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Get away from that phone.</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: I would advise you not to interfere.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I was willing to shoot Captain Renault, and
I’m willing to shoot you.</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Put that phone down!</p>
<p><strong>strasser</strong>: Get me the Radio Tower!</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Put it down!</p>
<p><strong>gendarme</strong>: Mon Capitaine!</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Major Strasser’s been shot.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Round up the usual suspects.</p>
<p><strong>gendarme</strong>: Oui, mon Capitaine.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Well, Rick, you’re not only a
sentimentalist, but you’ve become a patriot.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Maybe, but it seemed like a good time to
start.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: I think perhaps you’re right.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: It might be a good idea for you to
disappear from Casablanca for a while. There’s a Free French garrison
over at Brazzaville. I could be induced to arrange a passage.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: My letter of transit? I could use a trip. But
it doesn’t make any difference about our bet. You still owe me ten
thousand francs.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: And that ten thousand francs should pay our
expenses.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Our expenses?</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Uh huh.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Louis, I think this is the beginning of a
beautiful friendship.</p>
