<h1 id="sense-and-sensibility">sense-and-sensibility</h1>
<p><strong>mr dashwood</strong>: Is John not yet arrived?</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: We expect him at any moment,
dearest.</p>
<p><strong>mr dashwood</strong>: The girls–I have left so little.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: Shh, hush, Henry.</p>
<p><strong>mr dashwood</strong>: Elinor will try to look after you all,
but make sure she finds a good husband. The men are such noodles
hereabouts, little wonder none has pleased her.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: But Marianne is sure to find her
storybook hero.</p>
<p><strong>mr dashwood</strong>: A romantic poet with flashing eyes and
empty pockets?</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: As long as she loves him, whoever he
is.</p>
<p><strong>mr dashwood</strong>: Margaret will go to sea and become a
pirate so we need not concern ourselves with her.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Your son is arrived from London, sir.</p>
<p><strong>mr dashwood</strong>: Let me speak to John alone.</p>
<p><strong>mr dashwood</strong>: Ah, my dear. How happy you have made
me.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Father…</p>
<p><strong>mr dashwood</strong>: John you will find out soon enough from
my will that the estate of Norland was left to me in such a way as
prevents me from dividing it between my families.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Calm yourself, Father. This is not good for
you.</p>
<p><strong>mr dashwood</strong>: Norland in its entirety is therefore
yours by law and I am happy for you and Fanny.</p>
<p><strong>mr dashwood</strong>: But your stepmother my wife and
daughters are left with only five hundred pounds a year, barely enough
to live on and nothing for the girls’ dowries. You must help them.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Of course</p>
<p><strong>mr dashwood</strong>: You must promise to do this.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I promise, Father, I promise.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Come! Come quickly!</p>
<p><strong>mr dashwood</strong>: Help them.</p>
<p><strong>fanny</strong>: ‘Help them?’</p>
<p><strong>fanny</strong>: What do you mean, ‘help them’?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Dearest, I mean to give them three thousand
pounds.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: The interest will provide them with a little
extra income. Such a gift will certainly discharge my promise to my
father.</p>
<p><strong>fanny</strong>: Oh, without question! More than amply…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: One had rather, on such occasions, do too much
than too little.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Of course, he did not stipulate a particular
sum.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: To be reduced to the condition of
visitor in my own home! It is not to be borne, Elinor!</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Consider, Mamma! We have nowhere to go.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: John and Fanny will descend from
London at any moment, followed no doubt by cartloads of relatives ready
to turn us out of our rooms one by one do you expect me to be here to
welcome them? Vultures!</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: I shall start making inquiries for a new
house at once. Until then we must try to bear their coming.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Fifteen hundred then. What say you to fifteen
hundred?</p>
<p><strong>fanny</strong>: What brother on earth would do half so much
for his real sisters–let alone half-blood?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: They can hardly expect more.</p>
<p><strong>fanny</strong>: There is no knowing what they expect. The
question is, what can you afford?</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Marianne, cannot you play something else?
Mamma has been weeping since breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: I meant something less mournful,
dearest.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: A hundred pounds a year to their mother while
she lives. Would that be more advisable? It is better than parting with
the fifteen hundred all at once.</p>
<p><strong>fanny</strong>: But if she should live longer than fifteen
years we would be completely taken in. People always live forever when
there is an annuity to be paid them.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Margaret, are you there? Please come down.
John and Fanny will be here soon.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Why are they coming to live at Norland?
They already have a house in London.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Because houses go from father to son,
dearest not from father to daughter. It is the law.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: If you come inside, we could play with your
atlas.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: It’s not my atlas any more. It’s their
atlas.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Twenty pounds now and then will amply
discharge my promise, you are quite right.</p>
<p><strong>fanny</strong>: Indeed. Although to say the truth, I am
convinced within myself that your father had no idea of your giving them
money.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: They will have five hundred a year amongst
them as it is–</p>
<p><strong>fanny</strong>: –and what on earth can four women want for
more than that? Their housekeeping will be nothing at all they will have
no carriage, no horses, hardly any servants and will keep no company.
Only conceive how comfortable they will be!</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: As you know, we are looking for a new home.
When we leave we shall be able to retain only Thomas and Betsy.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: We are very sorry to have to leave you all.
But we are certain you will find the new Mrs Dashwood a fair and
generous mistress.</p>
<p><strong>fanny</strong>: They will be much more able to give you
something.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: So we are agreed. No money but the occasional
gift of game and fish in season will be very welcome.</p>
<p><strong>fanny</strong>: Your father would be proud of you.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: How is Mrs Ferrars?</p>
<p><strong>fanny</strong>: My mother is always in excellent health,
thank you. My brother Robert is in town with her this season and quite
the most popular bachelor in London! He has his own barouche.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: You have two brothers, have you not?</p>
<p><strong>fanny</strong>: Indeed, yes. Edward is the eldest Mamma quite
depends upon him. He is traveling up from Plymouth shortly and will
break his journey here.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: If that is agreeable to you, of course.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: My dear John this is your home
now.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Fanny wishes to know where the key for the
silver cabinet is kept.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Betsy has it, I think. What does Fanny want
with the silver?</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: I can only presume she wants to count it.
What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Presents for the servants. Have you seen
Margaret? I am worried about her. She has taken to hiding in the oddest
places.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Fortunate girl. At least she can escape
Fanny, which is more than any of us is able.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: You do your best. You have not said a word
to her for a week.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: I have! I have said ‘yes’ and ‘no’.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Good morning, Fanny.</p>
<p><strong>fanny</strong>: Good morning, Marianne.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: How did you find the silver? Is it all
genuine?</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Pray, when may we expect the pleasure of
your brother’s company?</p>
<p><strong>fanny</strong>: Edward is due tomorrow. And my dear Mrs
Dashwood, in view of the fact that he will not be with us for long, I
wondered if Miss Margaret would mind giving up her room to him the view
is quite incomparable from her windows and I should so much like Edward
to see Norland at its best.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Intolerable woman!</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: There is but one consolation if Edward is
anything like Fanny, we shall be only too happy to leave.</p>
<p><strong>fanny</strong>: But where is Miss Margaret? I declare, Mrs
Dashwood, I am beginning to doubt of her existence! She must run
positively wild!</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: Forgive us, Mr Ferrars. My youngest is
not to be found this morning. She is a little shy of strangers at
present.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Naturally. I am also shy of strangers and I
have nothing like her excuse.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: How do you like your view, Mr Ferrars?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Very much. Your stables are very handsome
and beautifully kept, Mrs Dashwood.</p>
<p><strong>fanny</strong>: Stables! Edward–your windows overlook the
lake.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: An oversight, Fanny, led me to the wrong
room. I have rectified the situation and am happily settled in the guest
quarters.</p>
<p><strong>fanny</strong>: They are all exceedingly spoilt, I find. Miss
Margaret spends all her time up trees and under furniture and I have
barely had a civil word from Marianne.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: My dear Fanny, they have just lost their
father their lives will never be the same again.</p>
<p><strong>fanny</strong>: That is no excuse.</p>
<p><strong>fanny</strong>: I have never liked the smell of books.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Oh? No. The dust, perhaps.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I hear you have great plans for the walnut
grove.</p>
<p><strong>fanny</strong>: Oh yes! I shall have it pulled down to make
room for a Grecian temple.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: How picturesque. Will you show me the
site?</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Too expensive. We do not need four bedrooms,
we can share.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: This one, then?</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Marianne, we have only five hundred pounds a
year. I will send out more inquiries today.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Pardon my intrusion, but I believe I have
found what you are looking for.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Won’t you come out, dearest? We haven’t seen
you all day. Mamma is very concerned.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Oh, Miss Dashwood! Excuse me I was wondering
do you by any chance have such a thing as a reliable atlas?</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: I believe so.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Excellent. I wish to check the position of
the Nile.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: My sister says it is in South America.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Oh! No, no indeed. She is quite wrong. For I
believe it is in–in Belgium.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Belgium? Surely not. You must be thinking of
the Volga.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: The Volga?</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Of course. The Volga, which, as you know,
starts in…</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Vladivostok, and ends in…</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: St Albans.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Indeed. Where the coffee beans come
from.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: The source of the Nile is in
Abyssinia.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Is it? Good heavens. How do you do. Edward
Ferrars.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Margaret Dashwood.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: That was my father’s favourite.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Thank you so much for your help with
Margaret, Mr Ferrars. She is a changed girl since your arrival.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Not at all. I enjoy her company.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Has she shown you her tree-house?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Not yet. Would you do me the honour, Miss
Dashwood? It is very fine out.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: With pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Margaret has always wanted to travel.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I know. She is heading an expedition to
China shortly. I am to go as her servant but only on the understanding
that I will be very badly treated.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: What will your duties be?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Sword-fighting, administering rum and
swabbing.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Ah.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: All I want–all I have ever wanted is the
quiet of a private life but my mother is determined to see me
distinguished.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: As?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: She hardly knows. Any fine figure will suit
a great orator, a leading politician, even a barrister would serve, but
only on the condition that I drive my own barouche and dine in the first
circles.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: And what do you wish for?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I always preferred the church, but that is
not smart enough for my mother she prefers the army, but that is a great
deal too smart for me.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Would you stay in London?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I hate London. No peace. A country living is
my ideal a small parish where I might do some good, keep chickens and
give very short sermons.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: You talk of feeling idle and useless imagine
how that is compounded when one has no choice and no hope whatsoever of
any occupation.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Our circumstances are therefore precisely
the same.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Except that you will inherit your
fortune.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: We cannot even earn ours.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Perhaps Margaret is right.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Right?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Piracy is our only option.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: What is swabbing exactly?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: No voice divine the storm allayed No light
propitious shone, When snatched from all effectual aid, We perished each
alone: But I beneath a rougher sea, And whelmed in deeper gulfs than
he.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: No, Edward! Listen.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Can you not feel his despair? Try
again.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Mamma, look. This has just arrived.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: ‘I should be pleased to offer you a
home at Barton Cottage as soon as ever you have need of it’ why, it is
from my cousin, Sir John Middleton!</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Even Elinor must approve the rent.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: Has Elinor not yet seen this?</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: No I will fetch her.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: Wait. No. Let us delay.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: I think–I believe that Edward and
Elinor have formed an attachment.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: It would be cruel to take her away so
soon and Devonshire is so far.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: Why so grave? Do you disapprove her
choice?</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: By no means. Edward is very amiable.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: Amiable but?</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: But there is something wanting. He is too
sedate his reading last night.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: Elinor has not your feelings, his
reserve suits her.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Can he love her? Can the ardour of the
soul really be satisfied with such polite, concealed affections? To love
is to burn to be on fire, all made of passion, of adoration, of
sacrifice! Like Juliet, or Guinevere or Heloise.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: They made rather pathetic ends,
dear.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Pathetic! To die for love? How can you say
so? What could be more glorious?</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: I think that may be taking your
romantic sensibilities a little far.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: The more I know of the world, the more I
am convinced that I shall never see a man whom I can truly love.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: You require so much!</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: I do not! I require only what any young
woman of taste should a man who sings well, dances admirably, rides
bravely, reads with passion and whose tastes agree in every point with
my own.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Is love a fancy, or a feeling? No It is
immortal as immaculate truth ’Tis not a blossom shed as soon as Youth
Drops from the stem of life for it will grow In barren regions, where no
waters flow Nor ray of promise cheats the pensive gloom–</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: What a pity it is that Edward has no
passion for reading.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: It was you who asked him to read and then
you made him nervous.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: But your behaviour to him in all other
respects is perfectly cordial so I must assume that you like him in
spite of his deficiencies.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: I think him everything that is amiable and
worthy.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Praise indeed!</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: But he shall have my unanswering devotion
when you tell me he is to be my brother.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: How shall I do without you?</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Do without me?</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: I am sure you will be very happy. But you
must promise not to live too far away.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Marianne, there is no question of that is,
there is no under standing between…</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Do you love him?</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: I do not attempt to deny that I think very
highly of him that I greatly esteem that I like him.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Esteem him! Like him! Use those insipid
words again and I shall leave the room this instant!</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Very well. Forgive me. Believe my feelings
to be stronger than I have declared but further than that you must not
believe.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: ‘Is love a fancy or a feeling?’ Or a
Ferrars?</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Go to bed!</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: ‘I do not attempt to deny that I think
highly of him greatly esteem him! Like him!’</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: We are all so happy that you chose to
invite Edward to Norland. He is a dear boy and we are all very fond of
him.</p>
<p><strong>fanny</strong>: We have great hopes for him. Much is expected
of him by our mother with regard to his profession</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: Naturally.</p>
<p><strong>fanny</strong>: And in marriage. She is determined that both
he and Robert will marry well.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: Of course. But I hope she desires them
to marry for love, first and foremost? I have always felt that, contrary
to common wisdom, true affection is by far the most valuable dowry.</p>
<p><strong>fanny</strong>: Love is all very well, but unfortunately we
cannot always rely on the heart to lead us in the most suitable
directions.</p>
<p><strong>fanny</strong>: You see, my dear Mrs Dashwood, Edward is
entirely the kind of compassionate person upon whom penniless women can
prey–and having entered into any kind of understanding, he would never
go back on his word. He is quite simply incapable of doing so. But it
would lead to his ruin. I worry for him so, Mrs Dashwood. My mother has
always made it perfectly plain that she will withdraw all financial
support from Edward, should he choose to plant his affections in less…
exalted ground than he deserves.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: I understand you perfectly.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Devonshire!</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: My cousin Sir John Middleton has
offered us a small house on his estate.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Sir John Middleton? What is his situation? He
must be a man of property.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: He is a widower. He lives with his
mother-in-law at Barton Park and it is Barton Cottage that he offers
us.</p>
<p><strong>fanny</strong>: Oh, a cottage! How charming. A little cottage
is always very snug.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: But you will not leave before the
summer?</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: Oh, my dear Edward, we can no longer
trespass upon your sister’s good will. We must leave as soon as
possible.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: You will come and stay with us,
Edward!</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I should like that very much.</p>
<p><strong>fanny</strong>: Edward has long been expected in town by our
mother.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: Come as soon as you can, Edward.
Remember that you are always welcome.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Cannot you take him with you?</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: We cannot possibly afford him.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Perhaps he could make himself useful in the
kitchen?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Miss Dashwood–Elinor. I must talk to
you.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: There is something of great importance I
need… to tell you–</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: –about–about my education.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Your education?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Yes. It was less… successful than it might
have been.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: It was conducted in Plymouth–oddly
enough.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Indeed?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Yes. Do you know it?</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Plymouth?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Oh–well–I spent four years there– at a
school run by a–a Mr Pratt–</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Pratt?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Precisely–Mr Pratt–and there, I– that is to
say, he has a–</p>
<p><strong>fanny</strong>: Edward! Edward!</p>
<p><strong>fanny</strong>: I have been all over for you! You are needed
in London this instant!</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Fanny, I am leaving this afternoon as it
is–</p>
<p><strong>fanny</strong>: No, no, that will not do. Family affairs are
in chaos owing to your absence. Mother is quite adamant that you should
leave at once.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Excuse me, Miss Dashwood.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Edward promised he would bring the atlas
to Barton for me.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Did he? Well, I will wager he will do so
in less than a fortnight!</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Are we there yet?</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: Sir John!</p>
<p><strong>sir john</strong>: Dear ladies, dear ladies, upon my word,
here you are, here you are, here you are!</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: Sir John, your extraordinary
kindness–</p>
<p><strong>sir john</strong>: Oh, none of that, hush, please, none of
that, but here is my dear mamma- in-law Mrs Jennings.</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: Was the journey tolerable, you poor
souls?</p>
<p><strong>sir john</strong>: Why did you not come up to the Park first
and take your ease? We saw you pass–Like many people who live rather
lonely lives together.</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: –but I would not wait for you to come
to us, I made John call for the carriage–</p>
<p><strong>sir john</strong>: She would not wait, you know.</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: –as we get so little company.</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: But I feel as if I know you already–
delightful creatures!</p>
<p><strong>sir john</strong>: Delightful! And you know you are to dine
at Barton Park every day.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: Oh, but dear Sir John, we cannot–</p>
<p><strong>sir john</strong>: Oh, no no no no no no no, I shall not
brook refusals. I am quite deaf to ’em, you know–</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: –deaf–</p>
<p><strong>sir john</strong>: But I insist!</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Let us only settle in for a few days, Sir
John, and thank you–</p>
<p><strong>sir john</strong>: Oh, no thankings, no, please, can’t bear
’em, embarrassing, you know–</p>
<p><strong>sir john</strong>: We will send game and fruit as a matter of
course–</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: –fruit and game–</p>
<p><strong>sir john</strong>: –and the carriage is at your beck and
call–</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: –call–and here is Miss Marianne!</p>
<p><strong>sir john</strong>: Where did you disappear to?</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: I declare you are the loveliest girl I
ever set eyes on! Cannot you get them married, Mrs Dashwood? You must
not leave it too long!</p>
<p><strong>sir john</strong>: But, alas, there are no smart young men
hereabouts to woo them–</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: –not a beau for miles!</p>
<p><strong>sir john</strong>: Come, Mother, let us leave them in
peace.</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: But there is Colonel Brandon!</p>
<p><strong>sir john</strong>: Excellent fellow! We served in the East
India Regiment together.</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: Just wait till he sees you! If we can
persuade him out to meet you!</p>
<p><strong>sir john</strong>: Reclusive individual. But you are
fatigued. I can see that you are fatigued.</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: Of course she is fatigued!</p>
<p><strong>sir john</strong>: Come along, Mother, we really must leave
them to themselves.</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: You must get your maidservant to make
you up some camphor–it is the best tonic for the staggers!</p>
<p><strong>sir john</strong>: Send Thomas to us for the carriage when
you are ready!</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I like them.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: What generosity.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Indeed. I am surprised they did not offer us
their clothing.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Sugar is five shilling a pound these parts,
Miss Dashwood.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: No more sugar then.</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: Not a beau for miles.</p>
<p><strong>sir john</strong>: Where can Brandon be, poor fellow? I hope
he has not lamed his horse.</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: Colonel Brandon is the most eligible
bachelor in the county–he is bound to do for one of you. Mind, he is a
better age for Miss Dashwood–but I dare say she left her heart behind in
Sussex, eh?</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: Aha! I see you, Miss Marianne! I think
I have unearthed a secret!</p>
<p><strong>sir john</strong>: Oho! Have you sniffed one out already,
Mother? You are worse than my best pointer, Flossie!</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: What sort of man is he, Miss Dashwood?
Is he butcher, baker, candlestick- maker? I shall winkle it out of you
somehow, you know!</p>
<p><strong>sir john</strong>: She’s horribly good at winkling.</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: You are in lonely country now, Miss
Dashwood, none of us has any secrets here–</p>
<p><strong>sir john</strong>: –or if we do, we do not keep them for
long!</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: He is curate of the parish, I dare
say!</p>
<p><strong>sir john</strong>: Or a handsome lieutenant!</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: Give us a clue, Miss Dashwood–is he in
uniform?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: He has no profession!</p>
<p><strong>sir john</strong>: No profession! A gentleman, then!</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Margaret, you know perfectly well there is
no such person.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: There is! There is! And his name begins
with an F!</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: Margaret!</p>
<p><strong>sir john</strong>: F indeed! A very promising letter. Let
me–F, F, Fo, Fa… Upon my word, but I cannot think of a single name
beginning with F–</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: Forrest? Foster? Frost? Foggarty?</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Sir John, might I play your
pianoforte?</p>
<p><strong>sir john</strong>: Of course, yes–my goodness. We do not
stand on ceremony here, my dear.</p>
<p><strong>sir john</strong>: Brandon! Where have you been? Come, come
and meet our beautiful new neighbours!</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: What a pity you are late, Colonel! You
have missed the most delightful singing!</p>
<p><strong>colonel brandon</strong>: A great pity, indeed.</p>
<p><strong>sir john</strong>: Mrs Dashwood, may I present my dear friend
Colonel Brandon? We served together in the East Indies and I assure you
there is no better fellow on earth–</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Have you really been to the East Indies,
Colonel?</p>
<p><strong>colonel brandon</strong>: I have.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: What is it like?</p>
<p><strong>sir john</strong>: Like? Hot.</p>
<p><strong>colonel brandon</strong>: The air is full of spices.</p>
<p><strong>sir john</strong>: Come, Miss Dashwood–it is your turn to
entertain us!</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Oh no, Sir John, I do not–</p>
<p><strong>sir john</strong>: –and I think we can all guess what key you
will sing in!</p>
<p><strong>sir john/mrs jennings</strong>: F major!</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: As for you, you have no right, no right at
all, to parade your ignorant assumptions–</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: They are not assumptions. You told me.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: I told you nothing–</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: They’ll meet him when he comes,
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: That is not the point. You do not speak of
such things before strangers–</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: But everyone else was–</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Mrs Jennings is not everyone.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I like her! She talks about things. We
never talk about things.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: Hush, please, now that is enough,
Margaret. If you cannot think of anything appropriate to say, you will
please restrict your remarks to the weather.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I like Colonel Brandon too. He’s been to
places.</p>
<p><strong>sir john</strong>: You know what they’re saying, of
course…</p>
<p><strong>sir john</strong>: The word is that you have developed a
taste for–certain company.</p>
<p><strong>sir john</strong>: And why not, say I. A man like you– in his
prime–she’d be a most fortunate young lady–</p>
<p><strong>colonel brandon</strong>: Marianne Dashwood would no more
think of me than she would of you, John.</p>
<p><strong>sir john</strong>: Brandon, my boy, do not think of yourself
so meanly–</p>
<p><strong>colonel brandon</strong>: And all the better for her.</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: Besotted! Excellent match, for he is
rich and she is handsome.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: How long have you known the Colonel?</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: Oh, Lord bless you, as long as ever I
have been here, and I came fifteen years back. His estate at Delaford is
but four miles hence and he and John are very thick. He has no wife or
children of his own, for–</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: –he has a tragic history. He loved a
girl once–twenty years ago now–a ward to his family, but they were not
permitted to marry…</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: On what grounds?</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: Money. Eliza was poor. When the father
discovered their amour, she was flung out of the house and he packed off
into the army. I believe he would have done himself a harm if not for
John…</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: What became of the lady?</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: Oh, she was passed from man to man–
disappeared from all good society. When Brandon got back from India he
searched for heaven knows how long, only to find her dying in a poor
house. You have seen how it has affected him. Once I thought my daughter
Charlotte might have cheered him up, but she is much better off where
she is.</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: Look at him now, though. So attentive.
I shall try an experiment on him.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Oh no, please, dear Mrs Jennings, leave the
poor Colonel alone.</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: No, no, it is just the thing–all
suitors need a little help, my dear</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: Colonel Brandon!</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: We have not heard you play for us of
late!</p>
<p><strong>colonel brandon</strong>: For the simple reason that you have
a far superior musician here.</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: Perhaps you did not know, Miss
Marianne, that our dear Brandon shares your passion for music and plays
the piano forte very well.</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: Play us a duet!</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: I’ll trow you know quite as many
melancholy tunes as Miss Marianne!</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: Come! Let us see you both side by
side!</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: I do not know any duets. Forgive me,
Colonel.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Oh! Are we never to have a moment’s peace?
The rent here may be low but I think we have it on very hard terms.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Mrs Jennings is a wealthy woman with a
married daughter–she has nothing to do but marry off everyone
else’s.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: There’s a parcel arrived for you, Miss
Dashwood!</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: A parcel!</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: It is too ridiculous! When is a man to be
safe from such wit if age and infirmity do not protect him?</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Infirmity!</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: If Colonel Brandon is infirm, then I
am at death’s door.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: It is a miracle your life has extended this
far…</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Did you not hear him complain of a
rheumatism in his shoulder?</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: A slight ache’ I believe was his phrase…</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: But Edward said he would bring it
himself.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: ‘Dear Mrs Dashwood, Miss Dashwood,
Miss Marianne and Captain Margaret– it gives me great pleasure to
restore this atlas to its rightful owner. Alas, business in London does
not permit me to accompany it, although this is likely to hurt me far
more than it hurts you. For the present my memories of your kindness
must be enough to sustain me, and I remain your devoted servant always.
E. C. Ferrars.’</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: But why hasn’t he come?</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: He says he is busy, dear.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: He said he’d come.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Why hasn’t he come?</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: I am taking you for a walk.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: No! I’ve been a walk.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: You need another.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: It is going to rain.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: It is not going to rain.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: You always say that and then it always
does.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: I fear Mrs Jennings is a bad
influence.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: You must miss him, Elinor.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: We are not engaged, Mamma.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: But he loves you, dearest, of that I
am certain.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: I am by no means assured of his regard for
me.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: Oh, Elinor!</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: But even were he to feel such a… preference,
I think we should be foolish to assume that there would not be many
obstacles to his choosing a woman of no rank who cannot afford to buy
sugar…</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: But Elinor–your heart must tell
you–</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: In such a situation, Mamma, it is perhaps
better to use one’s head.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Is there any felicity in the world
superior to this?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I told you it would rain.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Look! There is some blue sky! Let us chase
it!</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I’m not supposed to run.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Marianne!</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Help me!</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Margaret, run home and fetch help.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I think it is this way. I will run as fast
as I can, Marianne.</p>
<p><strong>the stranger</strong>: Are you hurt?</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Only my ankle.</p>
<p><strong>the stranger</strong>: May I have your permission to–</p>
<p><strong>the stranger</strong>: –ascertain if there are any
breaks?</p>
<p><strong>the stranger</strong>: It is not broken. Now, can you put
your arm about my neck?</p>
<p><strong>the stranger</strong>: Allow me to escort you home.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: Marianne was sure it would not
rain.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Which invariably means it will.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: At last!</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: She fell over! She fell down–and he’s
carrying her!</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: Marianne!</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: In here, sir–this way. Margaret, open the
door wider. Please, sir, lay her here. Marianne, are you in pain?</p>
<p><strong>the stranger</strong>: It is a twisted ankle.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Do not be alarmed, Mamma.</p>
<p><strong>the stranger</strong>: I can assure you it is not serious. I
took the liberty of feeling the bone and it is perfectly sound.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: Sir, I cannot even begin to thank
you.</p>
<p><strong>the stranger</strong>: Please do not think of it. I’m
honoured of be of service.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: Will you not be seated?</p>
<p><strong>the stranger</strong>: Pray excuse me–I have no desire to
leave a water mark! But permit me to call tomorrow afternoon and inquire
after the patient?</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: We shall look forward to it!</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: His name! His name!</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: Please tell us to whom we are so much
obliged?</p>
<p><strong>the stranger</strong>: John Willoughby of Allenham–your
servant, ma’am!</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Mr John Willoughby of Allenham!</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: What an impressive gentleman!</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: He lifted me as if I weighed no more than
a dried leaf!</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Is he human?</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: Tell me if I hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: She feels no pain, Mamma. Margaret, ask
Betsy to make up a cold compress, please.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Did you see him? He expressed himself
well, did he not?</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: With great decorum and honour.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: And spirit and wit and feeling.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: And economy–ten words at most.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: And he is to come tomorrow!</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: You must change, Marianne–you will catch a
cold.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: What care I for colds when there is such a
man?</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: You will care very much when your nose
swells up.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: You are right. Help me, Elinor.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: What has happened?</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: We have decided to give you to the
Gypsies.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Will they be married before Edward and
Elinor, do you think, Mamma?</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: Margaret, you are worse than Mrs
Jennings.</p>
<p><strong>sir john</strong>: Mr Willoughby is well worth catching, Miss
Dashwood–Miss Marianne must not expect to have all the men to
herself!</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: But what do you know of Mr Willoughby, Sir
John?</p>
<p><strong>sir john</strong>: Decent shot–and there is not a bolder
rider in all England.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: But what is he like?</p>
<p><strong>sir john</strong>: Like?</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: What are his tastes? His passions? His
pursuits?</p>
<p><strong>sir john</strong>: Well, he has the nicest little bitch of a
pointer–was she out with him yesterday?</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: Where is Allenham, Sir John?</p>
<p><strong>sir john</strong>: Nice little estate three miles east. He is
to inherit it from an elderly relative–Lady Allen is her name.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: It is Colonel Brandon. I shall go outside
and keep watch.</p>
<p><strong>sir john</strong>: You are all on the lookout for Willoughby,
eh? Dear me, poor Brandon. You will none of you think of him now.</p>
<p><strong>colonel brandon</strong>: How is the invalid?</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Thank you so much, Colonel.</p>
<p><strong>sir john</strong>: Miss Marianne, I cannot see why you should
set your cap at Mr Willoughby when you have already made such a splendid
conquest!</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: I have no intention of ‘setting my cap’ at
anyone, Sir John!</p>
<p><strong>colonel brandon</strong>: Mr Willoughby–Lady Allen’s
nephew?</p>
<p><strong>sir john</strong>: Aye, he visits every year for he is to
inherit Allenham–and he has a very pretty estate of his own, Miss
Dashwood, Combe Magna in Somerset. If I were you, I would not give him
up to my younger sister in spite of all this tumbling down hills.</p>
<p><strong>sir john</strong>: Here is the man himself. Come, Brandon– we
know when we are not wanted. Let us leave him to the ladies!</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Marianne! Sir John and the Colonel are
leaving.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Goodbye, Colonel. Thank you for the
flowers.</p>
<p><strong>willoughby</strong>: How do you do, Colonel?</p>
<p><strong>sir john</strong>: How does he do? How do you do, more like.
Go on in, they’re waiting for you!</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: Mr Willoughby! What a pleasure to see
you again!</p>
<p><strong>willoughby</strong>: The pleasure is all mine, I can asstire
you. I trust Miss Marianne has not caught cold?</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: You have found out my name!</p>
<p><strong>willoughby</strong>: Of course. The neighbourhood is crawling
with my spies.</p>
<p><strong>willoughby</strong>: And since you cannot venture out to
nature, nature must be brought to you!</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: How beautiful. These are not from the
hothouse.</p>
<p><strong>willoughby</strong>: Ah! I see mine is not the first
offering, nor the most elegant. I am afraid I obtained these from an
obliging field.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: But I have always preferred wild
flowers!</p>
<p><strong>willoughby</strong>: I suspected as much.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: I will put these in water.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: Our gratitude, Mr Willoughby, is
beyond expression–</p>
<p><strong>willoughby</strong>: But it is I who am grateful. I have
often passed this cottage and grieved for its lonely state–and then the
first news I had from Lady Allen when I arrived was that it was taken. I
felt a peculiar interest in the event which nothing can account for but
my present delight in meeting you.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: Pray sit down, Mr Willoughby.</p>
<p><strong>willoughby</strong>: Who is reading Shakespeare’s
sonnets?</p>
<p><strong>marianne/elinor/mrs dashwood</strong>: I am. / We all are. /
Marianne.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: Marianne has been reading them out to
us.</p>
<p><strong>willoughby</strong>: Which are your favourites?</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Without a doubt, mine is 116.</p>
<p><strong>willoughby</strong>: Let me not to the marriage of true minds
Admit impediments. Love is not love Which alters when it alteration
finds, Or bends with the remover to remove–then how does it go?</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: ‘0, no! it is an ever-fixed mark.’</p>
<p><strong>willoughby</strong>: ‘That looks on storms’–or is it
tempests? Let me find it.</p>
<p><strong>willoughby</strong>: It is strange you should be reading
them–for, look, I carry this with me always.</p>
<p><strong>willoughby</strong>: Till tomorrow! And my pocket sonnets are
yours, Miss Marianne! A talisman against further injury!</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Goodbye! Thank you!</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Good work, Marianne! You have covered all
forms of poetry; another meeting will ascertain his views on nature and
romantic attachments and then you will have nothing left to talk about
and the acquaintanceship will be over.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: I suppose I have erred against decorum. I
should have been dull and spiritless and talked only of the weather, or
the state of the roads.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: No, but Mr Willoughby can be in no doubt of
your enthusiasm for him.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Why should he doubt it? Why should I hide
my regard?</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: No particular reason, Marianne, only that we
know so little of him–</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: But time alone does not determine
intimacy. Seven years would be insufficient to make some people
acquainted with each other and seven days are more than enough for
others.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Or seven hours in this case.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: I feel I know Mr Willoughby well already.
If I had weaker, more shallow feelings perhaps I could conceal them, as
you do–</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: Marianne, that is not fair–</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: I am sorry, Elinor, I did not mean</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: I know. Do not trouble yourself,
Marianne.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: I do not understand her, Mamma. Why does
she never mention Edward? I have never even seen her cry about him, or
about Norland.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: Nor I. But Elinor is not like you or
I, dear. She does not like to be swayed by her emotions.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: Surely you are not going to deny us
beef as well as sugar?</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: There is nothing under tenpence a pound. We
have to economise.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: Do you want us to starve?</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: No. Just not to eat beef.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: If there was any true impropriety in my
behaviour, I should be sensible of it, Elinor–</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: But as it has already exposed you to some
very impertinent remarks, do you not begin to doubt your own
discretion?</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: If the impertinent remarks of such as Mrs
Jennings are proof of impropriety, then we are all offending every
moment of our lives–</p>
<p><strong>colonel brandon</strong>: Miss Dashwood! Miss Marianne!</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Good morning, Colonel!</p>
<p><strong>colonel brandon</strong>: I come to issue an invitation. A
picnic on my estate at Delaford–if you would care to join us on Thursday
next. Mrs Jennings’s daughter and her husband are traveling up
especially.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Thank you, Colonel, we shall be
delighted.</p>
<p><strong>colonel brandon</strong>: I will of course be including Mr
Willoughby in the party.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: I should be delighted to join you,
Colonel!</p>
<p><strong>willoughby</strong>: Good morning, Miss Dashwood; good
morning, Colonel.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: The Colonel has invited us to Delaford,
Willoughby!</p>
<p><strong>willoughby</strong>: Excellent. I understand you have a
particularly fine pianoforte, Colonel.</p>
<p><strong>colonel brandon</strong>: A Broadwood Grand.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: A Broadwood Grand! Then I shall really be
able to play for you!</p>
<p><strong>willoughby</strong>: We shall look forward to it!</p>
<p><strong>colonel brandon</strong>: Your sister seems very happy.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Yes. Marianne does not approve of hiding her
emotions. In fact, her romantic prejudices have the unfortunate tendency
to set propriety at naught.</p>
<p><strong>colonel brandon</strong>: She is wholly unspoilt.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Rather too unspoilt, in my view. The sooner
she becomes acquainted with the ways of the world, the better.</p>
<p><strong>colonel brandon</strong>: I knew a lady like your sister–the
same impulsive sweetness of temper– who was forced into, as you put it,
a better acquaintance with the world. The result was only ruination and
despair.</p>
<p><strong>colonel brandon</strong>: Do not desire it, Miss
Dashwood.</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: Imagine my surprise, Mrs Dashwood,
when Charlotte and her lord and master appeared with our cousin Lucy!
The last person I expected to see! ‘Where did you pop out from, Miss?’
says I. I was never so surprised to see anyone in all my life!</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: She probably came on purpose to share
the fun, for there are no funds for such luxuries at home, poor
thing.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: I had not seen you for so long, dear Mrs
Jennings, I could not resist the opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Oh, you sly thing! It was the Misses
Dashwood she wanted to see, not Delaford, Mamma! I have heard nothing
but ‘Miss Dashwood this, Miss Dashwood that’ for I don’t know how long!
And what do you think of them now you do see them, Lucy? My mother has
talked of nothing else in her letters since you came to Barton, Mrs
Dashwood. Mr Palmer–are they not the very creatures she describes?</p>
<p><strong>mr palmer</strong>: Nothing like.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Why, Mr Palmer! Do you know you are quite
rude today? He is to be an MP, you know, Mrs Dashwood, and it is very
fatiguing for him for he is forced to make everybody like him– he says
it is quite shocking–</p>
<p><strong>mrs palmer</strong>: I never said anything so irrational.
Don’t palm all your abuses of the language upon me.</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: Mr Palmer is so droll–he is always out
of humour.</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: Here he is! Now you shall see,
Charlotte.</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: How now, Mr Willoughby! You must greet
my daughter Charlotte, and Mr Palmer–</p>
<p><strong>willoughby</strong>: How do you do?</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: And my little cousin, Miss Lucy
Steele.</p>
<p><strong>willoughby</strong>: Welcome to our party, Miss Steele!</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: I know Mr Willoughby extremely well– not
that I ever spoke to him but I have seen him forever in town. Your
sister is monstrous lucky to get him. Mamma says Colonel Brandon is in
love with her as well, which is a very great compliment for he hardly
ever falls in love with anyone.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: May I beg a seat beside you, Miss Dashwood? I
have so longed to make your better acquaintance! I have heard nothing
but the highest praise for you.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: I would be delighted. But Sir John and Mrs
Jennings are too excessive in their compliments. I am sure to
disappoint.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: No, for it was from quite another source that
I heard you praised and one not at all inclined to exaggeration.</p>
<p><strong>sir john</strong>: What can this be?</p>
<p><strong>colonel brandon</strong>: My horse! Quickly!</p>
<p><strong>sir john</strong>: What is the matter, Brandon?</p>
<p><strong>colonel brandon</strong>: I must away to London.</p>
<p><strong>sir john</strong>: No! Impossible!</p>
<p><strong>colonel brandon</strong>: Imperative.</p>
<p><strong>sir john</strong>: But Brandon, we are all assembled. We
cannot picnic at Delaford without our host! Go up to town tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>willoughby</strong>: Or wait till we return and start
then–you would not be six hours later.</p>
<p><strong>colonel brandon</strong>: I cannot afford to lose one
minute.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Oh, Miss Dashwood, I cannot bear it! Just when
I was to have the opportunity of speaking with you.</p>
<p><strong>willoughby</strong>: Frailty, thy name is Brandon!</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: There are some people who cannot bear a
party of pleasure. I think he wrote the letter himself as a trick for
getting out of it.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: You are a very wicked pair, Colonel
Brandon will be sadly missed.</p>
<p><strong>willoughby</strong>: Why? When he is the kind of man that
everyone speaks well of and no one wants to talk to.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Exactly!</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Nonsense.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: Colonel Brandon is very highly
esteemed at the Park.</p>
<p><strong>willoughby</strong>: Which is enough censure in itself.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Really, Willoughby!</p>
<p><strong>willoughby</strong>: Come, come, Mr Impudence–I know you and
your wicked ways–oh!</p>
<p><strong>willoughby</strong>: Come, Miss Dashwood, reveal your beau,
reveal him, I say! Let’s have no secrets between friends! Let me winkle
them out of you!</p>
<p><strong>willoughby</strong>: I declare, Miss Marianne, if I do not
have you married to the Colonel by teatime, I shall swallow my own
bonnet.</p>
<p><strong>willoughby</strong>: As if you could marry such a
character.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Why should you dislike him?</p>
<p><strong>willoughby</strong>: Because he has threatened me with rain
when I wanted it fine, he has found fault with the balance of my
curricle and I cannot persuade him to buy my brown mare. If it will be
of any satisfaction to you, however, to be told I believe his character
to be in all other respects irreproachable, I am ready to confess it.
And in return for an acknowledgement that must give me some pain. You
cannot deny me the privilege… of disliking him… as much as I adore…</p>
<p><strong>willoughby</strong>: –this cottage!</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: I have great plans for improvements to
it, you know, Mr Willoughby.</p>
<p><strong>willoughby</strong>: Now that I will never consent to. Not a
stone must be added to its walls. Were I rich enough, I would instantly
pull down Combe Magna and build it up again in the exact image of that
cottage!</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: With dark, narrow stairs, a poky hall and a
fire that smokes?</p>
<p><strong>willoughby</strong>: Especially the fire that smokes! Then I
might be as happy at Combe Magna as I have been at Barton.</p>
<p><strong>willoughby</strong>: But this place has one claim on my
affection which no other can possibly share.</p>
<p><strong>willoughby</strong>: Promise me you will never change it.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: I do not have the heart.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Or the money.</p>
<p><strong>willoughby</strong>: Miss Marianne, will you–will you do me
the honour of granting me an interview tomorrow–alone?</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Willoughby, we are always alone!</p>
<p><strong>willoughby</strong>: But there is something very particular I
should like to ask you.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Of course. I shall ask Mamma if I may stay
behind from church.</p>
<p><strong>willoughby</strong>: Thank you. Until tomorrow then–Miss
Marianne.</p>
<p><strong>london</strong>: FOOTPADS, dogs, rats and SCAVENGERS of all
kinds. In the distance a tavern belches forth drunken REVELLERS who sway
and reel into the night.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Do you think he will kneel down when he
asks her?</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Shhh!</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: They always kneel down.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: What is wrong, my dearest?</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: Willoughby! What is the matter?</p>
<p><strong>willoughby</strong>: I–forgive me, Mrs Dashwood. I am
sent–that is to say, Lady Allen has exercised the privilege of riches
upon a dependent cousin and is sending me to London.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: When–this morning?</p>
<p><strong>willoughby</strong>: Almost this moment.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: How very disappointing! But your
business will not detain you from us for long, I hope?</p>
<p><strong>willoughby</strong>: You are very kind–but I have no idea of
returning immediately to Devonshire. I am seldom invited to Allenham
more than once a year.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: For shame, Willoughby! Can you wait
for an invitation from Barton Cottage?</p>
<p><strong>willoughby</strong>: My engagements at present are of such a
nature–that is–I dare not flatter myself–</p>
<p><strong>willoughby</strong>: It is folly to linger in this manner. I
will not torment myself further.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Willoughby, come back!</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Meg, dearest, please ask Betsy to make a cup
of hot tea for Marianne.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: What is wrong, my love?</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Nothing! Please do not ask me
questions!</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Please let me be!</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: They must have quarreled.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: That is unlikely. Perhaps this–Lady
Allen–disapproves of his regard for Marianne and has invented an excuse
to send him away?</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Then why did he not say as much? It is not
like Willoughby to be secretive. Did he think Marianne was richer than
she is?</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: How could he?</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: What is it you suspect him of?</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: I can hardly tell you. But why was his
manner so guilty?</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: What are you saying, Elinor? That he
has been acting a part to your sister for all this time?</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: No, he loves her, I am sure.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: Of course he loves her!</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: But has he left her with any assurance of
his return? Cannot you ask her if he has proposed?</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: Certainly not. I cannot force a
confidence from Marianne and nor must you. We must trust her to confide
in us in her own time.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: There was something so underhand in the
manner of his leaving.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: You are resolved, then, to think the
worst of him.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Not resolved–</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: I prefer to give him the benefit of my
good opinion. He deserves no less. From all of us.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Mamma, I am very fond of Willoughby–</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: She would not let me in.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: How like a winter hath my absence been
from thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year! What freezings have I
felt, what dark days seen! What old December’s bareness everywhere!</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Oh! If only this rain would stop!</p>
<p><strong>mr palmer</strong>: If only you would stop.</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: ’Twas you took her off my hands, Mr
Palmer, and a very good bargain you made of it too, but now I have the
whip hand over you for you cannot give her back!</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: Miss Marianne, come and play a round
with us! Looking out at the weather will not bring him back.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: She ate nothing at dinner.</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: Mind, we are all a little forlorn
these days. London has swallowed all our company.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Dear Miss Dashwood, perhaps now we might have
our–discussion.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Our discussion?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: There is a particular question I have long
wanted to ask you, but perhaps you will think me impertinent?</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: I cannot imagine so.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: But it is an odd question. Forgive me, I have
no wish to trouble you–</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: My dear Miss Steele–</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Miss Dashwood, if only Mr Willoughby had
gone home to Combe Magna, we could have taken Miss Marianne to see him!
For we live but half a mile away.</p>
<p><strong>mr palmer</strong>: Five and a half.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: No, I cannot believe it is that far, for
you can see the place from the top of our hill. Is it really five and a
half miles? No! I cannot believe it.</p>
<p><strong>mr palmer</strong>: Try.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: You have my permission to ask any manner of
question, if that is of any help.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Thank you. I wonder, are you at all acquainted
with your sister-in-law’s mother? Mrs Ferrars?</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: With Fanny’s mother? No, I have never met
her.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: I am sure you think me strange for
inquiring–if I dared tell–</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: If she tells you aught of the famous
‘Mr F’, Lucy, you are to pass it on.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Will you take a turn with me, Miss
Dashwood?</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: I had no idea at all that you were connected
with that family.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Oh! I am certainly nothing to Mrs Ferrars at
present–but the time may come when we may be very intimately
connected.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: What do you mean? Do you have an
understanding with Fanny’s brother Robert?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: The youngest? No, I never saw him in my life.
No, with Edward.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Edward?</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Edward Ferrars?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Edward and I have been secretly engaged these
five years.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: You may well be surprised. I should never have
mentioned it, had I not known I could entirely trust you to keep our
secret. Edward cannot mind me telling you for he looks on you quite as
his own sister.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: I am sorry, but we surely–we cannot mean the
same Mr Ferrars?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: The very same–he was four years under the
tutelage of my uncle Mr Pratt, down in Plymouth. Has he never spoken of
it?</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Mr Pratt! Yes, I believe he has.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: I was very unwilling to enter into it without
his mother’s approval but we loved each other with too great a passion
for prudence. Though you do nor know him so well as I, Miss Dashwood,
you must have seen how capable he is of making a woman sincerely
attached to him. I cannot pretend it has not been very hard on us both.
We can hardly meet above twice a year.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: You seem out of sorts, Miss Dashwood– are you
quite well?</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Perfectly well, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: I have not offended you?</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: On the contrary.</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: I can stand it no longer, I must know
what you are saying, Lucy! Miss Dashwood is quite engrossed!</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Oh, Miss Dashwood, if anyone finds out, it
will ruin him–you must not tell a soul! Edward says you would not break
your word to save your life! Promise me!</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: I give you my word.</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: Well, what can have fascinated you to
such an extent, Miss Dashwood?</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Tell us all!</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: We were talking of London, ma’am, and all
its–diversions.</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: Do you hear, Charlotte?</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: While you were so busy whispering,
Charlotte and I have concocted a plan!</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: It is the best plan in the world.</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: I make for London shortly and I invite
you, Lucy, and both the Misses Dashwood to join me!</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: London!</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Oh, can I go! Can I go?</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: You know perfectly well you are too
young, dearest.</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: I shall convey you all to my house in
Berkeley Street and we shall taste all the delights of the season–what
say you?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Oh, please can I go? I’m twelve soon.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Mr Palmer, do you not long to have the
Misses Dashwood come to London?</p>
<p><strong>mr palmer</strong>: I came into Devonshire with no other
view.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Mrs Jennings, you are very kind, but we
cannot possibly leave our mother…</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Indeed, the loss would be too great.</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: Your mother can spare you very
well.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: Of course I can!</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Of course she can!</p>
<p><strong>sir john</strong>: And look at Miss Marianne–it would break
her heart to deny her!</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: I will brook no refusal, Miss
Dashwood!</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: Let you and me strike hands upon the
bargain–and if I do not have the three of you married by Christmas, it
will not be my fault!</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: I was never so grateful in all my life as
I am to Mrs Jennings. What a kind woman she is! I like her more than I
can say. Oh, Elinor! I shall see Willoughby. Think how surprised he will
be! And you will see Edward!</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Are you asleep?</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: With you in the room?</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: I do not believe you feel as calm as you
look, not even you, Elinor. I will never sleep tonight! Oh, what were
you and Miss Steele whispering about so long?</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Nothing of significance.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: I have written to Edward, Miss Dashwood, and
yet I do not know how much I may see of him. Secrecy is vital–he will
never be able to call.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: I should imagine not.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: It is so hard. I believe my only comfort has
been the constancy of his affection.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: You are fortunate, over such a lengthy
engagement, never to have had any doubts on that score.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Oh! I am of rather a jealous nature and if he
had talked more of one young lady than any other… but he has never given
a moment’s alarm on that count.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Imagine how glad he will be to learn that we
are friends!</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: To be sure, my dear, you must just
hand it to Pigeon there. He will take care of it.</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: Lord above, you do not waste any time,
Miss Marianne!</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: A letter! So they are definitely engaged! Mrs
Jennings says your sister will buy her wedding clothes here in town.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Indeed Miss Steele, I know of no such
plan.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: John and Fanny are in town. I think we shall
be forced to see them.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: I think it was for next door.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Yes, you are right.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Oh, Elinor! It is Willoughby, indeed it
is!</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Oh! Excuse me, Colonel–</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Colonel Brandon, what a pleasure to see you!
Have you been in London all this while?</p>
<p><strong>colonel brandon</strong>: I have. How is your dear
mother?</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Very well, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Colonel, is there anything–</p>
<p><strong>colonel brandon</strong>: Forgive me, Miss Dashwood, but I
have heard reports through town… is it impossible to–but I could have no
chance of succeeding–indeed I hardly know what to do. Tell me once and
for all, is everything finally resolved between your sister and Mr
Willoughby?</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Colonel, though neither one has informed me
of their under standing, I have no doubt of their mutual affection.</p>
<p><strong>colonel brandon</strong>: Thank you, Miss Dashwood. To your
sister I wish all imaginable happiness. To Mr Willoughby, that he… may
endeavour to deserve her.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>colonel brandon</strong>: Forgive me, I–forgive me.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Where is dear Edward, John? We expect to
see him daily.</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: And who is ‘dear Edward’?</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Who indeed?</p>
<p><strong>fanny</strong>: My brother, Mrs Jennings–Edward Ferrars.</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: Indeed! Is that Ferrars with an F?</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Are there any messages, Pigeon?</p>
<p><strong>pigeon</strong>: No, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: No message at all? No cards?</p>
<p><strong>pigeon</strong>: None, ma am.</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: I note you do not inquire for your
messages, Miss Dashwood!</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: No, for I do not expect any, Mrs Jennings. I
have very little acquaintance in town.</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: She is as sly as you, Lucy!</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Marianne, is anything wrong?</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Nothing at all. Go back to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>pigeon</strong>: No messages, ma am.</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: Do not fret, my dear. I am told that
this good weather is keeping many sportsmen in the country at present,
but the frost will drive them back to town very soon, depend upon
it.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Of course! I had not thought of– thank
you, Mrs Jennings!</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: And Miss Dashwood may set her heart at
rest, for I overheard your sister- in-law say that she was to bring the
elusive Mr F to the ball tonight!</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: This is very merry!</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: There you are! Goodness, how hot it
is, Mrs Dashwood. You are not alone, I trust?</p>
<p><strong>fanny</strong>: Indeed not. John is just gone to fetch my
brother–he has been eating ices.</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: Your brother! I declare, that is good
news indeed. At long last!</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Miss Dashwood, I declare I shall faint clean
away.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Mrs Jennings, may I present my brother-
in-law?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Mr Robert Ferrars!</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: My dear ladies–we meet at last!</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: So you must be the younger brother? Is
Mr Edward not here? Miss Dashwood here was counting on him!</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Oh! He is far too busy for such
gatherings–and has no special acquaintance here to make his attendance
worthwhile.</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: Well, I declare, I do not know what
the young men are about these days– are they all in hiding?</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: Come, Mr Robert, in the absence of
your brother, you must dance with our lovely Miss Dashwood!</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: It would be my honour.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: And perhaps Miss Steele might consider
reserving the allemande?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: You reside in Devonshire, I b’lieve, Miss
Dashwood?</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: We do.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: In a cottage?</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I am excessively fond of a cottage. If I had
any money to spare, I should build one myself.</p>
<p><strong>willoughby</strong>: How do you do, Miss Dashwood?</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: I am well, thank you, Mr Willoughby.</p>
<p><strong>willoughby</strong>: How is your–family?</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: We are all extremely well, Mr
Willoughby–thank you for your kind inquiry.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Willoughby!</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Good God, Willoughby! Will you nor shake
hands with me?</p>
<p><strong>willoughby</strong>: How do you do, Miss Marianne?</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Willoughby, what is the matter? Why have
you not come to see me? Were you not in London? Have you nor received my
letters?</p>
<p><strong>willoughby</strong>: Yes, I had the pleasure of receiving the
information which you were so good as to send me.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: For heaven’s sake, Willoughby, tell me
what is wrong!</p>
<p><strong>willoughby</strong>: Thank you–I am most obliged. If you will
excuse me, I must return to my party.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Willoughby!</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Marianne! Come away!</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Go to him, Elinor–force him to come to
me.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Dearest, do not betray what you feel to
everyone present! This is not the place for explanations–</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: Come along, dear.</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: Will you come, Lucy?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Oh, are we leaving so soon?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: If I might be so bold, Mrs Jennings, it
would be our pleasure to escort your young charge home.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: How very kind!</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: That is very handsome–</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: She actually sent him messages during the
night?</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Marianne, please tell me–</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Do not ask me questions!</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: You have no confidence in me.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: This reproach from you! You, who confide
in no one.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: I have nothing to tell.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Nor I. We have neither of us anything to
tell. I because I conceal nothing and you because you communicate
nothing.</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: There now! Lovers’ quarrels are swift
to heal! That letter will do the trick, mark my word.</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: I must be off. I hope he won’t keep
her waiting much longer, Miss Dashwood. It hurts to see her looking so
forlorn.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: What a welcome I had from Edward’s family,
Miss Dashwood–I am surprised you never told me what an agreeable woman
your sister-in-law is! And Mr Robert–all so affable!</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: It is perhaps fortunate that none of them
knows of your engagement. Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: ‘My dear Madam–I am quite at a loss to
discover in what point I could be so unfortunate as to offend you. My
esteem for your family is very sincere but if I have given rise to a
belief of more than I felt or meant to express, I shall reproach myself
for not having been more guarded. My affections have long been engaged
elsewhere and it is with great regret that I return your letters and the
lock of hair which you so obligingly bestowed upon me. I am etc. John
Willoughby.’</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Oh, Marianne.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Marianne, oh, Marianne–it is better to know
at once what his intentions are. Dearest, think of what you would have
felt if your engagement had carried on for months and months before he
chose to put an end to it.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: We are not engaged.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: But you wrote to him! I thought then that he
must have left you with some kind of understanding?</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: No–he is not so unworthy as you think
him.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Not so unworthy! Did he tell you that he
loved you?</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Yes. No–never absolutely. It was every day
implied, but never declared. Sometimes I thought it had been, but it
never was. He has broken no vow.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: He has broken faith with all of us, he made
us all believe he loved you.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: He did! He did–he loved me as I loved
him.</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: I had to come straight up–how are you,
Miss Marianne?</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: Poor thing! She looks very bad. No
wonder, Miss Dashwood, for it is but too true. I was told here in the
street by Miss Morton, who is a great friend: he is to be married at the
end of the month–to a Miss Grey with fifty thousand pounds. Well, said
I, if ’tis true, then he is a good-for-nothing who has used my young
friend abominably ill, and I wish with all my soul that his wife may
plague his heart out!</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: But he is not the only young man worth
having, my dear, and with your pretty face you will never want for
admirers.</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: Ah, me! She had better have her cry
out and have done with it. I will go and look out something to tempt
her– does she care for olives?</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: I cannot tell you.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: I cannot believe his nature capable of
such cruelty!</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Marianne, there is no excuse for him– this
is his hand–</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: But it cannot be his heart! Oh, Mamma! I
want Mamma! Elinor, please take me home! Cannot we go tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: There is no one to take us.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Cannot we hire a carriage?</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: We have no money–and indeed we owe Mrs
Jennings more courtesy.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: All she wants is gossip and she only likes
me because I supply it! Oh, God! I cannot endure to stay.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: I will find a way. I promise.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Apparently they never were engaged.</p>
<p><strong>fanny</strong>: Miss Grey has fifty thousand pounds. Marianne
is virtually penniless.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: She cannot have expected him to go through
with it. But I feel for Marianne–she will lose her bloom and end a
spinster like Elinor. I think, my dear, we might consider having them to
stay with us for a few days–we are, after all, family, and my
father.</p>
<p><strong>fanny</strong>: My love, I would ask them with all my heart,
but I have already asked Miss Steele for a visit and we cannot deprive
Mrs Jennings of all her company at once. We can invite your sisters some
other year, you know, and Miss Steele will profit far more from your
generosity–poor girl!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That is very thoughtful, Fanny. We shall ask
Elinor and Marianne next year, then… Certainly!</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Thank you for coming, Colonel.</p>
<p><strong>colonel brandon</strong>: How does your sister?</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: I must get her home as quickly as possible.
The Palmers can take us as far as Cleveland, which is but a day from
Barton–</p>
<p><strong>colonel brandon</strong>: Then permit me to accompany you and
take you straight on from Cleveland to Barton myself.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: I confess that is precisely what I had hoped
for. Marianne suffers cruelly, and what pains me most is how hard she
tries to justify Mr Willoughby. But you know her disposition.</p>
<p><strong>colonel brandon</strong>: Perhaps I–my regard for you all–
Miss Dashwood, will you allow me to prove it by relating some
circumstances which nothing but an earnest desire of being useful–</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: You have something to tell me of Mr
Willoughby.</p>
<p><strong>colonel brandon</strong>: When I quitted Barton last–but I
must go further back. A short account of myself will be necessary. No
doubt… no doubt Mrs Jennings has apprised you of certain events in my
past–the sad outcome of my connection with a young woman named
Eliza.</p>
<p><strong>colonel brandon</strong>: What is not commonly known is that
twenty years ago, Eliza bore an illegitimate child. The father, whoever
he was, abandoned them.</p>
<p><strong>colonel brandon</strong>: As she lay dying, she begged me to
look after the child. Eliza died in my arms, broken, wasted away–ah!
Miss Dashwood, such a subject– untouched for so many years–it is
dangerous…</p>
<p><strong>colonel brandon</strong>: I had failed Eliza in every other
way–I could not refuse her now. I took the child–Beth is her name– and
placed her with a family where I could be sure she would be well looked
after. I saw her whenever I could. I saw that she was headstrong like
her mother–and, God forgive me, I indulged her, I allowed her too much
freedom. Almost a year ago, she disappeared.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Disappeared!</p>
<p><strong>colonel brandon</strong>: I instigated a search but for eight
months I was left to imagine the worst. At last, on the day of the
Delaford picnic, I received the first news her. She was with child… and
the blackguard who had–</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Good God. Do you mean–Willoughby?</p>
<p><strong>colonel brandon</strong>: Before I could return to confront
him, Lady Allen learned of his behaviour and turned him from the house.
He beat a hasty retreat to London–</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Yes! He left us that morning, without any
explanation!</p>
<p><strong>colonel brandon</strong>: Lady Allen had annulled his legacy.
He was left with next to nothing, and in danger of losing all that
remained to his debtors–</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: –and so abandoned Marianne for Miss Grey and
her fifty thousand pounds.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Have you seen Mr Willoughby since you
learned…?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: We met by appointment, he to defend, I to
punish his conduct.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: We returned unwounded, so the meeting never
got abroad.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Is Beth still in town?</p>
<p><strong>colonel brandon</strong>: She has chosen to go into the
country for her confinement. Such has been the unhappy resemblance
between the fate of mother and daughter, and so imperfectly have I
discharged my trust.</p>
<p><strong>colonel brandon</strong>: I would not have burdened you, Miss
Dashwood, had I not from my heart believed it might, in time, lessen
your sister’s regrets.</p>
<p><strong>colonel brandon</strong>: I have described Mr Willoughby as
the worst of libertines–but I have since learned from Lady Allen that he
did mean to propose that day. Therefore I cannot deny that his
intentions towards Marianne were honourable, and I feel certain he would
have married her, had it not been for–for the money.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Dearest, was I right to tell you?</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Whatever his past actions, whatever his
present course, at least you may be certain that he loved you.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: But not enough. Not enough.</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: Here is someone to cheer you up, Miss
Dashwood!</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: How is your dear sister, Miss Dashwood? Poor
thing! I must say, I do not know what I should do if a man treated me
with so little respect.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: I hope you are enjoying your stay with John
and Fanny, Miss Steele?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: I was never so happy in my entire life, Miss
Dashwood! I do believe your sister-in-law has taken quite a fancy to me.
I had to come and tell you–for you cannot imagine what has happened!</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: No, I cannot.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Yesterday I was introduced to Edward’s
mother!</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Indeed?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: And she was a vast deal more than civil. I
have not yet seen Edward but now I feel sure to very soon–</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: There’s a Mr Edward Ferrars to see you, Miss
Dashwood.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Do ask him to come up.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Miss Dashwood, how can I–</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Mr Ferrars, what a pleasure to see you. You…
know Miss Steele, of course.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: How do you do, Miss Steele.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: I am well, thank you, Mr Ferrars.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Do sit down, Mr Ferrars.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: You must be surprised to find me here, Mr
Ferrars! I expect you thought I was at your sister’s house.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Let me call Marianne, Mr Ferrars. She would
be most disappointed to miss you.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Edward! I heard your voice! At last you
have found us!</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Forgive me, Marianne, my visit is shamefully
overdue. You are pale. I hope you have not been unwell?</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Oh, don’t think of me–Elinor is well, you
see, that must be enough for both of us!</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: How do you like London, Marianne?</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Not at all. The sight of you is all the
pleasure it has afforded, is that not so, Elinor?</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Why have you taken so long to come and see
us?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I have been much engaged elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Engaged elsewhere! But what was that when
there were such friends to be met?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Perhaps, Miss Marianne, you think young men
never honour their engagements, little or great.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: No, indeed–for Edward is the most fearful
of giving pain and the most incapable of being selfish of anyone I ever
saw.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Edward, will you not sit? Elinor, help me
to persuade him.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Forgive me but I must take my leave–</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: But you are only just arrived!</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: You must excuse me, I have a commission to
attend to for Fanny–</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: In that case perhaps you might escort me back
to your sister’s house, Mr Ferrars?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I would be honoured. Goodbye, Miss Dashwood,
Miss Marianne.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Why did you not urge him to stay?</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: He must have had his reasons for going.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: His reason was no doubt your coldness. If
I were Edward I would assume you did not care for me at all.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Poor Miss Marianne looked very badly t’other
day. When I think of her, deserted and abandoned, it frightens me to
think I shall never marry.</p>
<p><strong>fanny</strong>: Nonsense. You will marry far better than
either of the Dashwood girls.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: How can that possibly be?</p>
<p><strong>fanny</strong>: You have ten times their sense and looks.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: But I have no dowry.</p>
<p><strong>fanny</strong>: There are qualities which will always make up
for that, and you have them in abundance. It would not surprise me if
you were to marry far and away beyond your expectations.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: I wish it might be so. There is a young
man–</p>
<p><strong>fanny</strong>: Ah ha! I am glad to hear of it. Is he of good
breeding and fortune?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Oh both–but his family would certainly oppose
the match.</p>
<p><strong>fanny</strong>: Tush! They will allow it as soon as they see
you, my dear.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: It is a very great secret. I have told no one
in the world for fear of discovery.</p>
<p><strong>fanny</strong>: My dear, I am the soul of discretion.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: If I dared tell…</p>
<p><strong>fanny</strong>: I can assure you I am as silent as the
grave.</p>
<p><strong>fanny</strong>: Viper in my bosom!</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: Oh, my dears! What a commotion! Mr
Edward Ferrars–the very one I used to joke you about, Miss Dashwood– has
been engaged these five years to Lucy Steele!</p>
<p><strong>mrs jennings</strong>: Poor Mr Ferrars! His mother, who by
all accounts is very proud, demanded that he break the engagement on
pain of disinheritance. But he has refused to break his promise to Lucy.
He has stood by her, good man, and is cut off without a penny! She has
settled it all irrevocably upon Mr Robert. But I cannot stop, I must go
to Lucy. Your sister-in-law scolded her like any fury–drove her to
hysterics.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: How long have you known?</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Since the evening Mrs Jennings offered to
take us to London.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Why did you not tell me?</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Lucy told me in the strictest
confidence.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: I could not break my word.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: But Edward loves you.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: He made me no promises. He tried to tell me
about Lucy.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: He cannot marry her.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Would you have him treat her even worse than
Willoughby has treated you?</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: No–but nor would I have him marry where he
does not love.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Edward made his promise a long time ago,
long before he met me. Though he may… harbour some regret, I believe he
will be happy–in the knowledge that he did his duty and kept his word.
After all–after all that is bewitching in the idea of one’s happiness
depending entirely on one person, it is not always possible. We must
accept. Edward will marry Lucy–and you and I will go home.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Always resignation and acceptance! Always
prudence and honour and duty! Elinor, where is your heart?</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: What do you know of my heart? What do you
know of anything but your own suffering? For weeks, Marianne, I have had
this pressing on me without being at liberty to speak of it to a single
creature. It was forced upon me by the very person whose prior claims
ruined all my hopes. I have had to endure her exultation again and again
while knowing myself to be divided from Edward forever. Believe me,
Marianne, had I not been bound to silence I could have produced proof
enough of a broken heart even for you.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Oh, Elinor!</p>
<p><strong>colonel brandon</strong>: I have heard that your friend Mr
Ferrars has been entirely cast off by his family for persevering in his
engagement to Miss Steele.</p>
<p><strong>colonel brandon</strong>: Have I been rightly informed? Is it
so?</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: It is indeed so. Are you acquainted with Mr
Ferrars?</p>
<p><strong>colonel brandon</strong>: No, we have never met. But I know
only too well the cruelty–the impolitic cruelty of dividing two young
people long attached to one another. Mrs Ferrars does not know what she
may drive her son to–</p>
<p><strong>colonel brandon</strong>: I have a proposal to make that
should enable him to marry Miss Steele immediately. Since the gentleman
is so close a friend to your family, perhaps you will be good enough to
mention it to him?</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Colonel, I am sure he would be only too
delighted to hear it from your own lips.</p>
<p><strong>colonel brandon</strong>: I think not. His behaviour has
proved him proud–in the best sense. I feel certain this is the right
course.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Mr Ferrars.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Miss Dashwood.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Thank you for responding so promptly to my
message.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I was most grateful to receive it. I– Miss
Dashwood, God knows what you must think of me…</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Mr Ferrars–</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I have no right to speak, I know–</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Mr Ferrars, I have good news. I think you
know of our friend Colonel Brandon?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Yes, I have heard his name.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Colonel Brandon desires me to say that,
understanding you wish to join the clergy, he has great pleasure in
offering you the parish on his estate at Delaford, now just vacant, in
the hope that it may enable you–and Miss Steele–to marry.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Colonel Brandon?</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Yes. He means it as testimony of his concern
for–for the cruel situation in which you find yourselves.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Colonel Brandon give me a parish? Can it be
possible?</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: The unkindness of your family has made you
astonished to find friendship elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: No. Not to find it in you. I cannot be
ignorant that to you–to your goodness–I owe it all. I feel it. I would
express it if I could, but, as you know, I am no orator.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: You are very much mistaken. I assure you
that you owe it almost entirely to your own merit–I have had no hand in
it.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Colonel Brandon must be a man of great worth
and respect ability.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: He is the kindest and best of men.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: May I enquire why the Colonel did not tell
me himself?</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: I think he felt it would be better coming
from… a friend.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Your friendship has been the most important
of my life.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: You will always have it.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Forgive me.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Mr Ferrars, you honour your promises– that
is more important than anything else. I wish you–both–very happy.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Goodbye, Miss Dashwood.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: What a stroke of luck for Lucy and Edward
to find a parish so close to Barton! You will all be able to meet very
often. That will cheer you up, Miss Marianne. I do declare I have never
disliked a person so much as I do Mr Willoughby, for your sake.
Insufferable man! To think we can see his insufferable house from the
top of our hill!</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: I shall ask Jackson to plant some very
tall trees.</p>
<p><strong>mr palmer</strong>: You will do nothing of the sort.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: I hear Miss Grey’s bridal gown was
everything of the finest–made in Paris, no less. I should have liked to
see it, although I dare say it was a sorry affair, scalloped with
ruffles–but what do the French know about fashion?</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: I am resolved never to mention Mr
Willoughby’s name again, and furthermore I shall tell everyone I meet
what a good-for nothing he is.</p>
<p><strong>mr palmer</strong>: Be quiet.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: I do not think she drew breath from the
moment we left London. It is my fault–I should have found some other way
of getting home.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: There was no other way you said so
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: We shall be home soon enough. Mamma will
comfort you, dearest.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: I am stiff from sitting so long. Will you
tell Charlotte that I am going for a stroll? ELINOR glances at the sky
in concern.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: I think it is going to rain.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: No, no, it will not rain.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: You always say that and then it always
does.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: I will keep to the garden, near the
house.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: We are very proud of our little Thomas,
Colonel–and his papa has such a way with him…</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: There you are, Miss Dashwood! Mr Palmer
and the Colonel have locked themselves up in the billiard room. Come and
meet little Thomas. Where is Miss Marianne?</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: She is taking a little air in the
garden.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Oh, very good. That is the great
advantage of the countryside–all the fresh air and… and all the fresh
air…</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: He is the best child in the world– he
never cries unless he wants to and then, Lord, there is no stopping
him.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: I cannot see Marianne.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: She has probably taken shelter in one of
the greenhouses!</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Love is not love Which alters when it
alteration finds Or bends with the remover to remove: 0, no! it is an
ever-fixed mark That looks on tempests and is never shaken…</p>
<p><strong>colonel brandon</strong>: Marianne!</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Willoughby… Willoughby…</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: One thing is certain–she will be wet
through when she returns.</p>
<p><strong>mr palmer</strong>: Thank you for pointing that out, my dear.
Do not worry, Miss Dashwood– Brandon will find her. I think we can all
guess where she went.</p>
<p><strong>colonel brandon</strong>: She is not hurt–but we must get her
warm!</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: I think Marianne may need a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: You’ll wear yourself out, Colonel! Do not
worry! A day or two in bed will soon set her to rights!</p>
<p><strong>mr palmer</strong>: You can rely upon Harris, Colonel. I have
never found a better physician.</p>
<p><strong>colonel brandon</strong>: What is your diagnosis?</p>
<p><strong>dr harris</strong>: It is an infectious fever that has taken
far more serious hold than I would have expected in one so young. I
would recommend the hasty removal of your child, Mr Palmer–</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Mrs Bunting! Mrs Bunting!</p>
<p><strong>mr palmer</strong>: My dear Miss Dashwood, I am more sorry
than I can say. If you would prefer me to stay I am at your service.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Mr Palmer, that is very kind. But Colonel
Brandon and Dr Harris will look after us. Thank you for everything you
have done.</p>
<p><strong>dr harris</strong>: She is not doing as well as I would
like.</p>
<p><strong>colonel brandon</strong>: What can I do?</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Colonel, you have done so much already.</p>
<p><strong>colonel brandon</strong>: Give me an occupation, Miss
Dashwood, or I shall run mad. He is dangerously quiet.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: She would be easier if her mother were
here.</p>
<p><strong>colonel brandon</strong>: Of course. Barton is but eight
hours away. If I make no stop, you may see us early tomorrow
morning.</p>
<p><strong>colonel brandon</strong>: In your hands I know she will be
safe.</p>
<p><strong>dr harris</strong>: Double the number of drops and I will
return as soon as I can.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Who is that?</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Look, look, Elinor.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: There is no one there, dearest.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: It is Papa. Papa has come.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Dearest Papa!</p>
<p><strong>dr harris</strong>: I must fetch more laudanum. I cannot
pretend, Miss Dashwood, that your sister’s condition is not very
serious. You must prepare yourself. I will return very shortly.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Marianne, Marianne, please try–</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Marianne, please try–I cannot–I cannot do
without you. Oh, please, I have tried to bear everything else– I will
try–but please, dearest, beloved Marianne, do not leave me alone.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Elinor?</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: My mother!</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Mamma! She is out of danger!</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: There, there, my love, my
Marianne.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Where is Elinor?</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: I am here, dearest, I am here.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Colonel Brandon.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>colonel brandon</strong>: What though the sea with waves
continuall Doe eate the earth, it is no more at all.</p>
<p><strong>colonel brandon</strong>: Nor is the earth the lesse, or
loseth aught. For whatsoever from one place doth fall, Is with the tide
unto another brought…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dashwood</strong>: He certainly is nor so dashing as
Willoughby but he has a far more pleasing countenance. There was always
a something, if you remember, in Willoughby’s eyes at times which I did
not like.</p>
<p><strong>colonel brandon</strong>: ’For there is nothing lost, but may
be found, if sought…</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Shall we continue tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>colonel brandon</strong>: No–for I must away.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Away? Where?</p>
<p><strong>colonel brandon</strong>: That I cannot tell you. It is a
secret.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: But you will not stay away long?</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: There.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: There I fell, and there I first saw
Willoughby.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Poor Willoughby. He will always regret
you.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: But does it follow that, had he chosen me,
he would have been content?</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: He would have had a wife he loved but no
money–and might soon have learned to rank the demands of his pocket-book
far above the demands of his heart.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: If his present regrets are half as painful
as mine, he will suffer enough.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Do you compare your conduct with his?</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: No. I compare it with what it ought to
have been. I compare it with yours.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Our situations were very different.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: My illness has made me consider the past.
I saw in my own behaviour nothing but imprudence–and worse. I was
insolent and unjust to everyone–</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: –but you–you I wronged above all. Only I
knew your heart and its sorrows but even then I was never a grain more
compassionate. I brought my illness upon myself–I wanted to destroy
myself. And had I succeeded, what misery should I have caused you?</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: I shall mend my ways! I shall no longer
worry others nor torture myself. I am determined to enter on a course of
serious study—Colonel Brandon has promised me the run of his library and
I shall read at least six hours a day. By the end of the year I expect
to have improved my learning a very great deal.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: You’ll go blind if you’re not careful.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: Is Thomas back from Exeter, Betsy?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Yes, ma’am–he brung back two lovely fillets
for you.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: Beef is far less expensive in Exeter,
and anyway they are for Marianne.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Sixpence a piece, Miss Dashwood. Oh, and he
says Mr Ferrars is married, but I suppose you know that, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: Fetch Thomas to us, Betsy.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Beg pardon, Miss Dashwood, but they was the
cheapest in the market–</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: It was a very good price, Thomas, well
done. Would you be so kind as to build up the fire a little?</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Yes, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: Who told you that Mr Ferrars was
married, Thomas?</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: I seen him myself, ma’am, and his lady too,
Miss Lucy Steele as was– they were stopping in a chaise at the New
London Inn. I happened to look up as I passed the chaise and I see it
was Miss Steele. So I took off my hat and she inquired after you, ma’am,
and all the young ladies, especially Miss Dashwood, and bid me I should
give you her and Mr Ferrars’s best compliments and service and how
they’d be sure to send you a piece of the cake.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: Was Mr Ferrars in the carriage with
her?</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Yes, ma’am–I just seen him leaning back in
it, but he did not look up.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Did–</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Did Mrs Ferrars seem well?</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Yes, Miss Marianne–she said how she was
vastly contented and, since she was always a very affable young lady, I
made free to wish her joy.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: Thank you, Thomas.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: Your father once told me not to allow
you to neglect yourself. Now I find that it is I who have neglected you
most.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: No, Mamma.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: Yes, I have. We all have. Marianne is
right.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: I am very good at hiding.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: Then we must observe you more
closely.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Mamma?</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: Yes, my darling?</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: There is a painful difference between the
expectation of an unpleasant event and its final certainty.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: Marianne! Marianne! Come and see what
is coming!</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: ‘At last I have found a small enough
instrument to fir the parlour. I expect to follow it in a day or two, by
which time I expect you to have learned the enclosed. Your devoted
friend, Christopher Brandon.’</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: He must like you very much, Marianne.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: It is not just for me! It is for all of
us.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: Here is Colonel Brandon! Marianne!</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: I do not think it is the Colonel.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: It must be. He said he would arrive
today. You must play him the new song, Marianne.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Edward!</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: It is Edward!</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: Calm. We must be calm.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Mr Ferrars for you, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: Edward! What a pleasure to see
you.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Mrs Dashwood. Miss Marianne. Margaret. Miss
Dashwood. I hope I find you all well.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Thank you, Edward, we are all very
well.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: We have been enjoying very fine
weather.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Well, we have.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I am glad of it. The… the roads were very
dry.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: May I wish you great joy, Edward.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: I hope you have left Mrs Ferrars well?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Tolerably, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I–But EDWARD cannot seem to find any
words.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: Is Mrs Ferrars at the new parish?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: No–my mother is in town.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: I meant to enquire after Mrs Edward
Ferrars.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Then you have not heard–the news–I think you
mean my brother–you mean Mrs Robert Ferrars.</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: Mrs Robert Ferrars?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Yes. I received a letter from Miss Steele–or
Mrs Ferrars, I should say– communicating the… the transfer of her
affections to my brother Robert. They were much thrown together in
London, I believe, and… and in view of the change in my circumstances, I
felt it only fair that Miss Steele be released from our engagement. At
any rate, they were married last week and are now in Plymouth.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Then you–are not married.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Elinor! I met Lucy when I was very young.
Had I had an active profession, I should never have felt such an idle,
foolish inclination. At Norland my behaviour was very wrong. But I
convinced myself you felt only friendship for me and it was my heart
alone that I was risking. I have come with no expectations. Only to
profess, now that I am at liberty to do so, that my heart is and always
will be yours.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: He’s sitting next to her!</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood/marianne</strong>: Margaret, come down!/Is
he?</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: Margaret! Will you stop–</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: What’s happening now?</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: Marianne!</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: He’s kneeling down!</p>
<p><strong>mrs dashwood</strong>: Oh! Is he? Oh!</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Your mother, I suppose, will hardly be less
angry with Robert for marrying Lucy.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: The more so since she settled the money upon
him so irrevocably–</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: –no doubt because she had run out of sons to
disinherit.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Her family fluctuates at an alarming rate.
Then, in London, when you told me of the Colonel’s offer, I became
convinced that you wanted me to marry Lucy and that–well, that you and
Colonel Brandon…</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Me and Colonel Brandon!</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I shall not forget attempting to thank him
for making it possible for me to marry the woman I did not love while
convinced he had designs upon the woman I did–do–love.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Would you–can you–excuse me–</p>
