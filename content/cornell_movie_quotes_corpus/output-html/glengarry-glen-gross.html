<p><strong>levene</strong>: John…John…John. Okay. John. John. Look: The
Glengarry Highland’s leads, you’re sending Roma out. Fine. He’s a good
man. We know what he is. He’s fine. All I’m saying, you look at the
board, he’s throwing…wait, wait, wait, he’s throwing them away, he’s
throwing the leads away. All that I’m saying, that you’re wasting leads.
I don’t want to tell you your job. All that I’m saying, things get set,
I know they do, you get a certain mindset… A guy gets a reputation. We
know how this…all I’m saying, put a closer on the job. There’s more than
one man for the… Put a…wait a second, put a proven man out…and you
watch, now wait a second–and you watch your dollar volumes…You start
closing them for fifty ’stead of twenty- five…you put a closer on
the…</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Shelly, you blew the last…</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: No. John. No. Let’s wait, let’s back up
here, I did…will you please? Wait a second. Please. I didn’t “blow”
them. No. I didn’t “blow” them. No. One kicked out, one I closed…</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: …you didn’t close…</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: …I, if you’d listen to me. Please. I closed
the cocksucker. His ex, John, his ex, I didn’t know he was married…he,
the judge invalidated the…</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Shelly…</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: …and what is that, John? What? Bad luck.
That’s all it is. I pray in your life you will never find it runs in
streaks. That’s what it does, that’s all it’s doing. Streaks. I pray it
misses you. That’s all I want to say.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: What about the other two?</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: What two?</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Four. You had four leads. One kicked
out, one the judge, you say…</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: …you want to see the court records? John?
Eh? You want to go down…</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: …no…</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: …do you want to go downtown…?</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: …no…</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: …then…</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: …I only…</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: …then what is this “you say” shit, what is
that? What is that…?</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: All that I’m saying…</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: What is this “you say”? A deal kicks out…I
got to eat. Shit, Williamson, shit. You…Moss… Roma…look at the
sheets…look at the sheets. Nineteen eighty, eighty-one…eighty-two…six
months of eighty-two…who’s there? Who’s up there?</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Roma.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Under him?</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Moss.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Bullshit. John. Bullshit. April, September
1981. It’s me. It isn’t fucking Moss. Due respect, he’s an order taker,
John. He talks, he talks a good game, look at the board, and it’s me,
John, it’s me…</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Not lately it isn’t.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Lately kiss my ass lately. That isn’t how
you build an org…talk, talk to Murray. Talk to Mitch. When we were on
Peterson, who paid for his fucking car? You talk to him. The Seville…?
He came in, “You bought that for me Shelly.” Out of what? Cold calling.
Nothing. Sixty-five, when we were there, with Glen Ross Farms? You call
’em downtown. What was that? Luck? That was “luck”? Bullshit, John.
You’re burning my ass, I can’t get a fucking lead…you think that was
luck. My stats for those years? Bullshit…over that period of time…?
Bullshit. It wasn’t luck. It was skill. You want to throw that away,
John…? You want to throw that away?</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: It isn’t me…</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: …it isn’t you…? Who is it? Who is this I’m
talking to? I need the leads…</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: …after the thirtieth…</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Bullshit the thirtieth, I don’t get on the
board the thirtieth, they’re going to can my ass. I need the leads. I
need them now. Or I’m gone, and you’re going to miss me, John, I swear
to you.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Murray…</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: …you talk to Murray…</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: I have. And my job is to marshal those
leads…</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Marshal the leads…marshal the leads? What
the fuck, what bus did you get off of, we’re here to fucking sell. Fuck
marshaling the leads. What the fuck talk is that? What the fuck talk is
that? Where did you learn that? In school? That’s “talk,” my friend,
that’s “talk.” Our job is to sell. I’m the man to sell. I’m getting
garbage. You’re giving it to me, and what I’m saying is it’s fucked.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: You’re saying that I’m fucked.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Yes. I am. I’m sorry to antagonize you.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Let me…</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: …and I’m going to get bounced and
you’re…</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: …let me…are you listening to me…?</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Let me tell you something, Shelly. I do
what I’m hired to do. I’m…wait a second. I’m hired to watch the leads.
I’m given…hold on, I’m given a policy. My job is to do that. What I’m
told. That’s it. You, wait a second, anybody falls below a certain mark
I’m not permitted to give them the premium leads.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Then how do they come up above that mark?
With dreck…? That’s nonsense. Explain this to me. ’Cause it’s a waste,
and it’s a stupid waste. I want to tell you something…</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: You know what those leads cost?</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: The premium leads. Yes. I know what they
cost. John. Because I, I generated the dollar revenue sufficient to buy
them. Nineteen senny-nine, you know what I made? Senny-nine? Ninety-six
thousand dollars. John? For Murray… For Mitch…look at the sheets…</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Murray said…</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Fuck him. Fuck Murray. John? You know? You
tell him I said so. What does he fucking know? He’s going to have a
“sales” contest…you know what our sales contest used to be?</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Money. A fortune. Money lying on the ground.
Murray? When was the last time he went out on a sit? Sales contest? It’s
laughable. It’s cold out there now, John. It’s tight. Money is tight.
This ain’t sixty-five. It ain’t. It just ain’t. See? See? Now, I’m a
good man–but I need a…</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Murray said…</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: John. John…</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Will you please wait a second. Shelly.
Please. Murray told me: the hot leads…</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: …ah, fuck this…</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: The…Shelly? The hot leads are assigned
according to the board. During the contest. Period. Anyone who beats
fifty per…</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: That’s fucked. That’s fucked. You don’t look
at the fucking percentage. You look at the gross.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Either way. You’re out.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: I’m out.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: I’ll tell you why I’m out. I’m out, you’re
giving me toilet paper. John.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: I’ve seen those leads. I saw them when I was
at Homestead, we pitched those cocksuckers Rio Rancho nineteen
sixty-nine they wouldn’t buy. They couldn’t buy a fucking toaster.
They’re broke, John. They’re cold. They’re deadbeats, you can’t judge on
that. Even so. Even so. Alright. Fine. Fine. Even so. I go in, FOUR
FUCKING LEADS they got their money in a sock. They’re fucking Polacks,
John. Four leads. I close two. Two. Fifty per…</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: …they kicked out.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: They all kick out. You run in streaks, pal.
Streaks. I’m… I’m…don’t look at the board, look at me. Shelly Levene.
Anyone. Ask them on Western. Ask Getz at Homestead. Go ask Jerry Graff.
You know who I am…I NEED A SHOT. I got to get on the fucking board. Ask
them. Ask them. Ask them who ever picked up a check I was flush. Moss,
Jerry Graff, Mitch himself…Those guys lived on the business I brought
in. They lived on it…and so did Murray, John. You were here you’d of
benefited from it too. And now I’m saying this. Do I want charity? Do I
want pity? I want sits. I want leads that don’t come right out of a
phone book. Give me a lead hotter than that, I’ll go in and close it.
Give me a chance. That’s all I want. I’m going to get up on that fucking
board and all I want is a chance. It’s a streak and I’m going to turn it
around. I need your help.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: I can’t do it, Shelly.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: The leads are assigned randomly…</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Bullshit, bullshit, you assign them… What
are you telling me?</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: …apart from the top men on the contest
board.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Then put me on the board.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: You start closing again, you’ll be on
the board.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: I can’t close these leads, John. No one can.
It’s a joke. John, look, just give me a hot lead. Just give me two of
the premium leads. As a “test,” alright? As a “test” and I promise
you…</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: I can’t do it, Shel.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: I’ll give you ten percent.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Of what?</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: And what if you don’t close.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: I will close.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: What if you don’t close…?</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: I will close.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: What if you don’t? Then I’m fucked. You
see…? Then it’s my job. That’s what I’m telling you.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: I will close. John, John, ten percent. I can
get hot. You know that…</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Not lately you can’t…</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Fuck that. That’s defeatist. Fuck that. Fuck
it…Get on my side. Go with me. Let’s do something. You want to run this
office, run it.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Twenty percent.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Alright.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: And fifty bucks a lead.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: John. Listen. I want to talk to you. Permit
me to do this a second. I’m older than you. A man acquires a reputation.
On the street. What he does when he’s up, what he does otherwise…I said
“ten,” you said “no.” You said “twenty.” I said “fine,” I’m not going to
fuck with you, how can I beat that, you tell me?…Okay. Okay. We’ll…Okay.
Fine. We’ll…Alright, twenty percent, and fifty bucks a lead. That’s
fine. For now. That’s fine. A month or two we’ll talk. A month from now.
Next month. After the thirtieth. We’ll talk.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: What are we going to say?</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: No. You’re right. That’s for later. We’ll
talk in a month. What have you got? I want two sits. Tonight.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: I’m not sure I have two.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: I saw the board. You’ve got four…</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: I’ve got Roma. Then I’ve got Moss…</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Bullshit. They ain’t been in the office yet.
Give ’em some stiff. We have a deal or not? Eh? Two sits. The Des
Plaines. Both of ’em, six and ten, you can do it…six and ten…eight and
eleven, I don’t give a shit, you set ’em up? Alright? The two sits in
Des Plaines.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Alright.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Good. Now we’re talking.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: A hundred bucks.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Now? Now?</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Now. Yes…When?</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Ah, shit, John.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: I wish I could.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: You fucking asshole. I haven’t got it. I
haven’t got it, John. I’ll pay you tomorrow. I’m coming in here with the
sales, I’ll pay you tomorrow. I haven’t got it, when I pay, the gas…I
get back the hotel, I’ll bring it in tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Can’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: I’ll give you thirty on them now, I’ll bring
the rest tomorrow. I’ve got it at the hotel. John? We do that, for
chrissake?</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: I’m asking you. As a favor to me? John.
John: my daughter…</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: I can’t do it, Shelly…</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Well, I want to tell you something, fella,
wasn’t long I could pick up the phone, call Murray and I’d have your
job. You know that? Not too long ago. For what? For nothing. “Mur, this
new kid burns my ass.” “Shelly, he’s out.” You’re gone before I’m back
from lunch. I bought him a trip to Bermuda once…</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: I have to go…</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Wait. Alright. Fine. The one. Give me the
lead. Give me the one lead. The best one you have.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: I can’t split them.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Because I say so.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Is that it? Is that it? You want to do
business that way…?</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: You want to do business that way…? Alright.
Alright. Alright. Alright. What is there on the other list…?</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: You want something off the B list?</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Is that what you’re saying?</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: That’s what I’m saying. Yeah. I’d like
something off the other list. Which, very least, that I’m entitled to.
If I’m still working here, which for the moment I guess that I am. What?
I’m sorry I spoke harshly to you.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: That’s alright.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: The deal still stands, our other thing.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Good. Mmm. I, you know, I left my wallet
back at the hotel.</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Polacks and deadbeats.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: …Polacks…</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Deadbeats all.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: …they hold on to their money…</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: All of ’em. They, hey: it happens to us
all.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: Where am I going to work?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: You have to cheer up, George, you aren’t out
yet.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: I’m not?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: You missed a fucking sale. Big deal. A
deadbeat Polack. Big deal. How you going to sell ’em in the first
place…? Your mistake, you shoun’a took the lead.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: I had to.</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: You had to, yeah. Why?</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: To get on the…</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: To get on the board. Yeah. How you goan’a get
on the board sell’n a Polack? And I’ll tell you, I’ll tell you what
else. You listening? I’ll tell you what else: don’t ever try to sell an
Indian.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: I’d never try to sell an Indian.</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: You get those names come up, you ever get ’em,
“Patel?”</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: Mmm…</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: You ever get ’em?</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: Well, I think I had one once.</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: You did?</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: I…I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: You had one you’d know it. Patel. They keep
coming up. I don’t know. They like to talk to salesmen. They’re lonely,
something. They like to feel superior, I don’t know. Never bought a
fucking thing. You’re sitting down “The Rio Rancho this, the blah blah
blah,” “The Mountain View–” “Oh yes. My brother told me that…” They got
a grapevine. Fuckin’ Indians, George. Not my cup of tea. Speaking of
which I want to tell you something: I never got a cup of tea with them.
You see them in the restaurants. A supercilious race. What is this look
on their face all the time? I don’t know. I don’t know. Their broads all
look like they just got fucked with a dead cat, I don’t know. I don’t
know. I don’t like it. Christ…</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: The whole fuckin’ thing…The pressure’s just
too great. You’re ab…you’re absolu…they’re too important. All of them.
You go in the door. I…“I got to close this fucker, or I don’t eat
lunch,” “or I don’t win the Cadillac…” We fuckin’ work too hard. You
work too hard. We all, I remember when we were at Platt…huh? Glen Ross
Farms… didn’t we sell a bunch of that…”</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: They came in and they, you know…</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Well, they fucked it up.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: They did.</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: They killed the goose.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: They did.</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: And now…</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: We’re stuck with this…</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: We’re stuck with this fucking shit…</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: …this shit…</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: It’s too…</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: It is.</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Eh?</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: It’s too…</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: You get a bad month, all of a…</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: You’re on this…</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: All of, they got you on this “board…”</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Some contest board…</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: It’s not right.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: It’s not.</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: And it’s not right to the customers.</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: I know it’s not. I’ll tell you, you got, you
know, you got…what did I learn as a kid on Western? Don’t sell a guy one
car. Sell him five cars over fifteen years.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: That’s right?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Eh…?</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: That’s right?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Goddamn right, that’s right. Guys come on:
“Oh, the blah blah blah, I know what I’ll do: I’ll go in and rob
everyone blind and go to Argentina cause nobody ever thought of this
before.”</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: …that’s right…</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Eh?</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: No. That’s absolutely right.</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: And so they kill the goose. I, I, I’ll…and a
fuckin’ man, worked all his life has got to…</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: …that’s right…</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: …cower in his boots…</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: Shoes, boots, yes…</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: For some fuckin’ “Sell ten thousand and you
win the steak knives…”</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: For some sales pro…</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: …sales promotion, “You lose, then we fire
your…” No. It’s medieval… it’s wrong. “Or we’re going to fire your ass.”
It’s wrong.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Yes, it is. And you know who’s
responsible?</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: You know who it is. It’s Mitch. And Murray.
’Cause it doesn’t have to be this way.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Look at Jerry Graff. He’s clean, he’s doing
business for himself, he’s got his, that list of his with the
nurses…see? You see? That’s thinking. Why take ten percent? A ten
percent comm…why are we giving the rest away? What are we giving ninety
per…for nothing. For some jerk sit in the office tell you “Get out there
and close.” “Go win the Cadillac.” Graff. He goes out and buys. He pays
top dollar for the… you see?</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: That’s thinking. Now, he’s got the leads, he
goes in business for himself. He’s…that’s what I… that’s thinking! “Who?
Who’s got a steady job, a couple bucks nobody’s touched, who?”</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: Nurses.</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: So Graff buys a fucking list of nurses, one
grand–if he paid two I’ll eat my hat–four, five thousand nurses, and
he’s going wild…</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: He is?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: He’s doing very well.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: I heard that they were running cold.</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: The nurses?</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: You hear a lot of things…He’s doing very well.
He’s doing very well.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: With River Oaks?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: River Oaks, Brook Farms. All of that shit.
Somebody told me, you know what he’s clearing himself? Fourteen, fifteen
grand a week.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: Himself?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: That’s what I’m saying. Why? The leads. He’s
got the good leads… what are we, we’re sitting in the shit here. Why? We
have to go to them to get them. Huh. Ninety percent our sale, we’re
paying to the office for the leads.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: The leads, the overhead, the telephones,
there’s lots of things.</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: What do you need? A telephone, some broad to
say “Good morning,” nothing…nothing…</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: No, it’s not that simple, Dave…</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Yes. It is. It is simple, and you know what
the hard part is?</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Starting up.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: What hard part?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Of doing the thing. The dif…the difference.
Between me and Jerry Graff. Going to business for yourself. The hard
part is…you know what it is?</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Just the act.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: What act?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: To say “I’m going on my own.” ’Cause what you
do, George, let me tell you what you do: you find yourself in thrall to
someone else. And we enslave ourselves. To please. To win some fucking
toaster…to…to… and the guy who got there first made up those…</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: That’s right…</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: He made up those rules, and we’re working for
him.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: That’s the truth…</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: That’s the God’s truth. And it gets me
depressed. I swear that it does. At MY AGE. To see a goddamn: “Somebody
wins the Cadillac this month. P.S. Two guys get fucked.”</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: Huh.</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: You don’t ax your sales force.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: You…</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: You…</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: You build it!</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: That’s what I…</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: You fucking build it! Men come…</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: Men come work for you…</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: …you’re absolutely right.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: They…</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: They have…</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: When they…</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Look look look look, when they build your
business, then you can’t fucking turn around, enslave them, treat them
like children, fuck them up the ass, leave them to fend for themselves…
no. No. You’re absolutely right, and I want to tell you something.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: I want to tell you what somebody should
do.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Someone should stand up and strike back.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Somebody…</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: Yes…?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Should do something to them.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Something. To pay them back. Someone, someone
should hurt them. Murray and Mitch.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: Someone should hurt them.</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: How? Do something to hurt them. Where they
live.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Someone should rob the office.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: Huh.</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: That’s what I’m saying. We were, if we were
that kind of guys, to knock it off, and trash the joint, it looks like
robbery, and take the fuckin’ leads out of the files…go to Jerry
Graff.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: What could somebody get for them?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: What could we get for them? I don’t know. Buck
a throw…buck-a- half a throw…I don’t know…Hey, who knows what they’re
worth, what do they pay for them? All told…must be, I’d… three bucks a
throw…I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: How many leads have we got?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: The Glengarry…the premium leads…? I’d say we
got five thousand. Five. Five thousand leads.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: And you’re saying a fella could take and
sell these leads to Jerry Graff.</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: How do you know he’d buy them?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Graff? Because I worked for him.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: You haven’t talked to him.</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: No. What do you mean? Have I talked to him
about this?</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: Yes. I mean are you actually talking about
this, or are we just…</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: No, we’re just…</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: We’re just “talking” about it.</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: We’re just speaking about it. As an idea.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: As an idea.</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: We’re not actually talking about it.</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: Talking about it as a…</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: As a robbery.</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: As a “robbery”?! No.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: Well. Well…</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: So all this, um, you didn’t, actually, you
didn’t go talk to Graff.</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Not actually, no.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: You didn’t?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: No. Not actually.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: Did you?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Yes. I said, “Not actually.” The fuck you
care, George? We’re just talking…</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: We are?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: Because, because, you know, it’s a
crime.</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: That’s right. It’s a crime. It is a crime.
It’s also very safe.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: You’re actually talking about this?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: You’re going to steal the leads?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Have I said that?</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: Are you?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Did I say that?</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: Did you talk to Graff?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Is that what I said?</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: What did he say?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: What did he say? He’d buy them.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: You’re going to steal the leads and sell
the leads to him?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: What will he pay?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: A buck a shot.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: For five thousand?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: However they are, that’s the deal. A buck a
throw. Five thousand dollars. Split it half and half.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: You’re saying “me.”</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Yes. Twenty-five hundred apiece. One night’s
work, and the job with Graff. Working the premium leads.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: A job with Graff.</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Is that what I said?</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: He’d give me a job.</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: He would take you on. Yes.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: Is that the truth?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Yes. It is, George. Yes. It’s a big decision.
And it’s a big reward. It’s a big reward. For one night’s work. But it’s
got to be tonight.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: What? What? The leads.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: You have to steal the leads tonight?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: That’s right, the guys are moving them
downtown. After the thirtieth. Murray and Mitch. After the contest.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: You’re, you’re saying so you have to go in
there tonight and…</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: You…</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: I’m sorry?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: You.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: You have to go in. You have to get the
leads.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: I do?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: It’s not something for nothing, George, I took
you in on this, you have to go. That’s your thing. I’ve made the deal
with Graff. I can’t go. I can’t go in, I’ve spoken on this too much.
I’ve got a big mouth. “The fucking leads” et cetera, blah blah blah
“…the fucking tight ass company…”</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: They’ll know when you go over to Graff…</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: What will they know? That I stole the leads? I
didn’t steal the leads, I’m going to the movies tonight with a friend,
and then I’m going to the Como Inn. Why did I go to Graff? I got a
better deal. Period. Let ’em prove something. They can’t prove anything
that’s not the case.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: Dave.</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: You want me to break into the office
tonight and steal the leads?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Oh, yes, George.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Listen to this. I have an alibi, I’m going to
the Como Inn, why? Why? The place gets robbed, they’re going to come
looking for me. Why? Because I probably did it. Are you going to turn me
in? George? Are you going to turn me in?</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: What if you don’t get caught?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: They come to you, you going to turn me in?</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: Why would they come to me?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: They’re going to come to everyone.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: Why would I do it?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: You wouldn’t, George, that’s why I’m talking
to you. Answer me. They come to you. You going to turn me in?</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: Yes. I’m sure.</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Then listen to this: I have to get those leads
tonight. That’s something I have to do. If I’m not at the movies…if I’m
not eating over at the inn…If you don’t do this, then I have to come in
here…</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: …you don’t have to come in…</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: …and rob the place…</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: …I thought that we were only talking…</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: …they take me, then. They’re going to ask me
who were my accomplices.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: That’s ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Well, to the law, you’re an accessory. Before
the fact.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: I didn’t ask to be.</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Then tough luck, George, because you are.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: Why? Why, because you only told me about
it?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: Why are you doing this to me, Dave. Why are
you talking this way to me? I don’t understand. Why are you doing this
at all…?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: That’s none of your fucking business…</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: Well, well, well, talk to me, we sat down
to eat dinner, and here I’m a criminal…</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: You went for it.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: In the abstract…</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: So I’m making it concrete.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Why? Why you going to give me five grand?</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: Do you need five grand?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Is that what I just said?</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: You need money? Is that the…</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Hey, hey, let’s just keep it simple, what I
need is not the…what do you need…?</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: What is the five grand? What is the, you
said that we were going to split five…</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: I lied. Alright? My end is my business. Your
end’s twenty-five. In or out. You tell me, you’re out you take the
consequences.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: I do?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: And why is that?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Because you listened.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: …all train compartments smell vaguely of shit.
It gets so you don’t mind it. That’s the worst thing that I can confess.
You know how long it took me to get there? A long time. When you die
you’re going to regret the things you don’t do. You think you’re queer…?
I’m going to tell you something: we’re all queer. You think that you’re
a thief? So what? You get befuddled by a middle-class morality…? Get
shut of it. Shut it out. You cheated on your wife…? You did it, live
with it. You fuck little girls, so be it. There’s an absolute morality?
May be. And then what? If you think there is, then be that thing. Bad
people go to hell? I don’t think so. If you think that, act that way. A
hell exists on earth? Yes. I won’t live in it. That’s me. You ever take
a dump made you feel you’d just slept for twelve hours…?</p>
<p><strong>lingk</strong>: Did I…?</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>lingk</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Or a piss…? A great meal fades in reflection.
Everything else gains. You know why? ’Cause it’s only food. This shit we
eat, it keeps us going. But it’s only food. The great fucks that you may
have had. What do you remember about them?</p>
<p><strong>lingk</strong>: What do I…?</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>lingk</strong>: Mmmm…</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: I don’t know. For me, I’m saying, what is is,
it’s probably not the orgasm. Some broads, forearms on your neck,
something her eyes did. There was a sound she made…or, me, lying, in
the, I’ll tell you: me lying in bed; the next day she brought me caf� au
lait. She gives me a cigarette, my balls feel like concrete. Eh? What
I’m saying, what is our life? It’s looking forward or it’s looking back.
And that’s our life. That’s it. Where is the moment? And what is it that
we’re afraid of? Loss. What else? The bank closes. We get sick, my wife
died on a plane, the stock market collapsed…the house burnt down…what of
these happen…? None on ’em. We worry anyway. What does this mean? I’m
not secure. How can I be secure? Through amassing wealth beyond all
measure? No. And what’s beyond all measure? That’s a sickness. That’s a
trap. There is no measure. Only greed. How can we act?</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: The right way, we would say, to deal with
this: “There is a one-in- a-million chance that so and so will
happen…Fuck it, it won’t happen to me…” No. We know that’s not the right
way I think. We say the correct way to deal with this is “There is a
one-in-so-and- so chance this will happen…God protect me. I am
powerless, let it not happen to me…” But no to that. I say. There’s
something else. What is it? “If it happens, AS IT MAY for that is not
within our powers, I will deal with it, just as I do today with what
draws my concern today.” I say this is how we must act. I do those
things which seem correct to me today. I trust myself. And if security
concerns me, I do that which today I think will make me secure. And
every day I do that, when that day arrives that I need a reserve, odds
are that I have it, and the true reserve that I have is the strength
that I have of acting each day without fear. According to the dictates
of my mind. Stocks, bonds, objects of art, real estate. Now: what are
they? An opportunity. To what? To make money? Perhaps. To lose money?
Perhaps. To “indulge” and to “learn” about ourselves? Perhaps. So
fucking what? What isn’t? They’re an opportunity. That’s all. They’re an
event. A guy comes up to you, you make a call, you send in a brochure,
it doesn’t matter, “There’re these properties I’d like for you to see.”
What does it mean? What you want it to mean.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Money? If that’s what it signifies to you.
Security? Comfort? All it is is THINGS THAT HAPPEN TO</p>
<p><strong>you.</strong>: That’s all it is. How are they different? Some
poor newly married guy gets run down by a cab. Some busboy wins the
lottery. All it is, it’s a carnival. What’s special…what draws us? We’re
all different. We’re not the same. We are not the same. Hmmm. It’s been
a long day. What are you drinking?</p>
<p><strong>lingk</strong>: Gimlet.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Well, let’s have a couple more. My name is
Richard Roma, what’s yours?</p>
<p><strong>lingk</strong>: Lingk. James Lingk.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: James. I’m glad to meet you. I’m glad to meet
you, James. I want to show you something. It might mean nothing to
you…and it might not.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: I don’t know. I don’t know anymore. What is
that? Florida. Glengarry Highlands. Florida. “Florida. Bullshit.” And
maybe that’s true; and that’s what I said: but look here: what is this?
This is a piece of land. Listen to what I’m going to tell you now:</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: People used to say that there are numbers
of such magnitude that multiplying them by two made no difference.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Who used to say that?</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: In school.</p>
<p><strong>baylen</strong>: Alright…?</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Williamson…Williamson, they stole the
contracts…?</p>
<p><strong>baylen</strong>: Excuse me, sir…</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Did they get my contracts?</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: They got…</p>
<p><strong>baylen</strong>: Excuse me, fella.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: …did they…</p>
<p><strong>baylen</strong>: Would you excuse us, please…?</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Don’t fuck with me, fella. I’m talking about a
fuckin’ Cadillac car that you owe me…</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: They didn’t get your contract. I filed
it before I left.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: They didn’t get my contracts.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: They–excuse me…</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Oh, fuck. Fuck.</p>
<p><strong>williamson!!!</strong>: Williamson went into,</p>
<p><strong>baylen</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: They didn’t get the contracts.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Did they…</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: They got, listen to me…</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: The…</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Listen to me: They got some of them.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Some of them…</p>
<p><strong>baylen</strong>: Who told you…?</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Who told me wh…? You’ve got a fuckin’,
you’ve…a…who is this…? You’ve got a board-up on the window…Moss told
me.</p>
<p><strong>baylen</strong>: Moss…Who told him?</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: How the fuck do I know? What…talk to me.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: They took some of the con…</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: …some of the contracts…Lingk. James Lingk. I
closed…</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: You closed him yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: It went down. I filed it.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: You did?</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Then I’m over the fucking top and you owe me a
Cadillac.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: And I don’t want any fucking shit and I don’t
give a shit, Lingk puts me over the top, you filed it, that’s fine, any
other shit kicks out you go back. You…you reclose it, ’cause I closed it
and you…you owe me the car.</p>
<p><strong>baylen</strong>: Would you excuse us, please.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: I, um, and may…maybe they’re in… they’re
in…you should, John, if we’re ins…</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: I’m sure that we’re insured, George…</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Fuck insured. You owe me a car.</p>
<p><strong>baylen</strong>: Please don’t leave. I’m going to talk to
you. What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Are you talking to me?</p>
<p><strong>baylen</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: My name is Richard Roma.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: I, you know, they should be insured.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: What do you care…?</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: Then, you know, they wouldn’t be so
ups…</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Yeah. That’s swell. Yes. You’re right. How are
you?</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: I’m fine. You mean the board? You mean the
board…?</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: I don’t…yes. Okay, the board.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: I’m, I’m, I’m, I’m fucked on the board.
You. You see how…I… I can’t…my mind must be in other places. ’Cause I
can’t do any…</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: What? You can’t do any what?</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: I can’t close ’em.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Well, they’re old. I saw the shit that they
were giving you.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: Yes. They are old.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: They’re ancient.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: Clear…</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Clear Meadows. That shit’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: It is dead.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: It’s a waste of time.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: Yes. I’m no fucking good.</p>

<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: He said he filed…</p>

All the little ones, I have, I have to go back and…ah, fuck, I got to go

<p><strong>roma</strong>: They stole the phones.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: Where criminals can come in here… they take
the…</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: They stole the phones. They stole the leads.
They’re…Christ. What am I going to do this month? Oh, shit…</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: You think they’re going to catch… where are

<p><strong>roma</strong>: Down the street.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: To the restaura…what do you fucking…?</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Aren’t you going out today?</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: With what? With what, John, they took the
leads…</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: I have the stuff from last year’s…</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Oh. Oh. Oh, your “nostalgia” file, they’s
fine. No. Swell. ’Cause I don’t have to…</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: …you want to go out today…?</p>

<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: Were the leads…</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: …what am I going to do all month…</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: Were the leads insured?</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: I don’t know, George, why?</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: ’Cause, you know, ’cause they weren’t, I
know that Mitch and Murray uh…</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: That they’re going to be upset.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: That’s right. You want to go out
today…?</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: He said we’re all going to have to go talk
to the guy.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: He said we…</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: To the cops?</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Yeah. That’s swell. Another waste of time.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: A waste of time? Why?</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Why? ’Cause they aren’t going to find the
guy.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: The cops?</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Yes. The cops. No.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: They aren’t?</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: Why don’t you think so?</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Why? Because they’re stupid. “Where were you
last night…”</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: Where were you?</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Where was I?</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: I was at home, where were you?</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: At home.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: See…? Were you the guy who broke in?</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: Was I?</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Then don’t sweat it, George, you know why?</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: You have nothing to hide.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: When I talk to the police, I get
nervous.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Yeah. You know who doesn’t?</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: No, who?</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Thieves.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: They’re inured to it.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: You think so?</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: But what should I tell them?</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: The truth, George. Always tell the truth. It’s
the easiest thing to remember.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Patel? Ravidam Patel? How am I going to make a
living on thses deadbeat wogs? Where did you get this, from the
morgue?</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: If you don’t want it, give it back.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: I don’t “want” it, if you catch my drift.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: I’m giving you three leads. You…</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: What’s the fucking point in any case…? What’s
the point. I got to argue with you, I got to knock heads with the cops,
I’m busting my balls, sell you dirt to fucking deadbeats money in the
mattress, I come back you can’t even manage to keep the contracts safe,
I have to go back and close them again…What the fuck am I wasting my
time, fuck this shit. I’m going out and reclose last week’s…</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: The word from Murray is: leave them
alone. If we need a new signature he’ll go out himself, he’ll be the
president, just come in, from out of town…</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Okay, okay, okay, gimme this shit. Fine.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Now, I’m giving you three…</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Three? I count two.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Three.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Patel? Fuck you. Fuckin’ Shiva handed him a
million dollars, told him “sign the deal,” he wouldn’t sign. And Vishnu,
too. Into the bargain. Fuck that, John. You know your business, I know
mine. Your business is being an asshole, and I find out whose fucking
cousin you are, I’m going to go to him and figure out a way to have your
ass… fuck you–I’ll wait for the new leads.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Get the chalk. Get the chalk…get the chalk!
I closed ‘em! I closed the cocksucker. Get the chalk and put me on the
board. I’m going to Hawaii! Put me on the Cadillac board, Williamson!
Pick up the fuckin’ chalk. Eight units. Mountain View…</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: You sold eight Mountain View?</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: You bet your ass. Who wants to go to lunch?
Who wants to go to lunch? I’m buying. Eighty-two fucking grand. And
twelve grand in commission. John. On fucking deadbeat magazine
subscription leads.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Read it. Bruce and Harriett Nyborg. What
happened here?</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: Fuck. I had them on River Glen.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Somebody broke in.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Eight units?</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Shelly…!</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Hey, big fucking deal. Broke a bad
streak…</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: Shelly, the Machine, Levene.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: You…</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: That’s great.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Thank you, George.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Williamson, get on the phone, call
Mitch…</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: They took the phones…</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: They…</p>
<p><strong>baylen</strong>: Aaronow…</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: They took the typewriters, they took the
leads, they took the cash, they took the contracts…</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Wh…wh…Wha…?</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: We had a robbery.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Last night, this morning.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: They took the leads?</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Mmm.</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Fuckin’ asshole.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: What, they beat you with a rubber bat?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Cop couldn’t find his dick two hands and a
map. Anyone talks to this guy’s an asshole…</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: You going to turn State’s?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Fuck you, Ricky. I ain’t going out today. I’m
going home. I’m going home because nothing’s accomplished here…Anyone
talks to this guy is…</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Guess what the Machine did?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Fuck the Machine.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Mountain View. Eight units.</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Fuckin’ cop’s got no right talk to me that
way. I didn’t rob the place…</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: You hear what I said?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Yeah. He closed a deal.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Eight units. Mountain View.</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: You did that?</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Guess who?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: When…</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Just now.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Guess who?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: You just this morning…</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Harriet and blah blah Nyborg.</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: You did that?</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Eighty-two thousand dollars.</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Those fuckin’ deadbeats…</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: My ass. I told ’em. Listen to this: I
said…</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Hey, I don’t want to hear your fucking war
stories…</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Fuck you, Dave…</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: “You have to believe in yourself…
you”–look–“alright…?”</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Give me some leads. I’m going out… I’m getting
out of…</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: “…you have to believe in yourself…”</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Na, fuck the leads, I’m going home.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: “Bruce, Harriet…Fuck me, believe in
yourself…”</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: We haven’t got a lead…</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: They took ’em…</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Hey, they’re fuckin’ garbage any case…This
whole goddamn…</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: “…You look around, you say, ’This one has
so-and-so, and I have nothing…”</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: “’Why? Why don’t I get the
opportunities…?”</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: And did they steal the contracts…?</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Fuck you care…?</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: “I want to tell you something, Harriet…”</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: …the fuck is that supposed to mean…?</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Will you shut up, I’m telling you this…</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: Can we get some coffee…?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: How ya doing?</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: If anyone’s going, I could use some
coffee.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: “You do get the…” Huh? Huh?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Fuck is that supposed to mean?</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: “You do get the opportunity…You get them. As
I do, as anyone does…”</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Ricky?…That I don’t care they stole the
contracts?</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: I got ’em in the kitchen. I’m eating her
crumb cake.</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: It means, Dave, you haven’t closed a good one
in a month, none of my business, you want to push me to answer you. And
so you haven’t got a contract to get stolen or so forth.</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: You have a mean streak in you, Ricky, you know
that…?</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Rick. Let me tell you. Wait, we’re in
the…</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Shut the fuck up. Ricky. You have a mean
streak in you… And what the fuck are you babbling about…?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Bring that shit up. Of my volume. You were on
a bad one and I brought it up to you you’d harbor it. You’d harbor it a
long long while. And you’d be right.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Who said “Fuck the Machine”?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: “Fuck the Machine”? “Fuck the Machine”? What
is this. Courtesy class…? You’re fucked, Rick–are you fucking nuts?
You’re hot, so you think you’re the ruler of this place…?! You want
to…</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Dave…</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: …Shut up. Decide who should be dealt with how?
Is that the thing? I come into the fuckin’ office today, I get
humiliated by some jagoff cop. I get accused of…I get this shit thrown
in my face by you, you geniune shit, because you’re top name on the
board…</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Is that what I did? Dave? I humiliated you? My
God…I’m sorry…</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Sittin’ on top of the world, sittin’ on top of
the world, everything’s fucking peachfuzz…</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Oh, and I don’t get a moment to spare for a
bust-out humanitarian down on his luck lately. Fuck you, Dave, you know
you got a big mouth, and you make a close the whole place stinks with
your farts for a week. “How much you just ingested,” what a big man you
are, “Hey, let me buy you a pack of gum.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: I’ll show you how to chew it.” Your pal
closes, all that comes out of your mouth is bile, how fucked up you
are…</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: Who’s my pal…? And what are you, Ricky, huh,
what are you, Bishop Sheean? Who the fuck are you, Mr. Slick…? What are
you, friend to the workingman? Big deal. Fuck you, you got the memory a
fuckin’ fly. I never liked you.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: What is this, your farewell speech?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: I’m going home.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Your farewell to the troops?</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: I’m not going home. I’m going to
Wisconsin.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Have a good trip.</p>
<p><strong>moss</strong>: And fuck you. Fuck the lot of you. Fuck you
all.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: You were saying? Come on. Come on, you got
them in the kitchen, you got the stats spread out, you’re in your shirt-
sleeves, you can smell it. Huh? Snap out of it, you’re eating her crumb
cake.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: I’m eating her crumb cake…</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: How was it…?</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: From the store.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Fuck her…</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: “What we have to do is admit to ourself that
we see that opportunity…and take it. And that’s it.” And we sit there. I
got the pen out…</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: “Always be closing…”</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: That’s what I’m saying. The old ways. The
old ways…convert the motherfucker…sell him…sell him… make him sign the
check. The…Bruce, Harriet…the kitchen, blah: they got their money in
government bonds…I say fuck it, we’re going to go the whole route. I
plat it out eight units. Eighty- two grand. I tell them. “This is now.
This is that thing that you’ve been dreaming of, you’re going to find
that suitcase on the train, the guy comes in the door, the bag that’s
full of money. This is it, Harriett…”</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Harriett…</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Bruce…“I don’t want to fuck around with you.
I don’t want to go round this, and pussyfoot around the thing, you have
to look back on this. I do, too. I came here to do good for you and me.
For both of us. Why take an interim position?</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: The only arrangement I’ll accept is full
investment. Period. The whole eight units. I know that you’re saying ‘be
safe,’ I know what you’re saying. I know if I left you to yourselves,
you’d say ‘come back tomorrow,’ and when I walked out that door, you’d
make a cup of coffee…you’d sit down…and you’d think ‘let’s be safe…’ and
not to disappoint me you’d go one unit or maybe two, because you’d
become scared because you’d met possibility. But this won’t do, and
that’s not the subject…” Listen to this, I actually said this. “That’s
not the subject of our evening together.” Now I handed them the pen. I
held it in my hand. I turned the contract, eight units eighty-two grand.
“Now I want you to sign.” I sat there. Five minutes. Then, I sat there,
Ricky, twenty-two minutes by the kitchen clock. Twenty-two minutes by
the kitchen clock. Not a word, not a motion. What am I thinking? “My
arm’s getting tired?” No. I did it. I did it. Like in the old says,
Ricky. Like I was taught… Like, like, like I used to do…I did it.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Like you taught me…</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Bullshit, you’re…No. That’s raw… well, if I
did, then I’m glad I did. I, well. I locked on them. All on them,
nothing on me. All my thoughts are on them. I’m holding the last thought
that I spoke: “Now is the time.” They signed, Ricky. It was great. It
was fucking great. It was like they wilted all at once. No
gesture…nothing. Like together.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: They, I swear to God, they both kind of
imperceptibly slumped. And he reaches and takes the pen and signs, he
passes it to her, she signs. It was so fucking solemn. I just let it
sit. I nod like this. I nod again. I grasp his hands. I shake his hands.
I grasp her hands. I nod at her like this. “Bruce…Harriet…” I’m beaming
at them. I’m nodding like this. I point back in the living room, back to
the sideboard. I didn’t fucking know there was a sideboard there!! He
goes back, he brings us a drink. Little shot glasses. A pattern in ’em.
And we toast. In silence.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: That was a great sale, Shelly.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Ah, fuck. Leads! Leads! Williamson! Send me
out! Send me out!</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: The leads are coming.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Get ’em to me!</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: I talked to Murray and Mitch an hour
ago. They’re coming in, you understand they’re a bit upset over this
morning’s…</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Did you tell ’em my sale?</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: How could I tell ’em your sale? Eh? I
don’t have a tel…I’ll tell ’em your sale when they bring in the leads.
Alright? Shelly. Alright? We had a little… You closed a deal. You made a
good sale. Fine.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: It’s better than a good sale. It’s a…</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Look: I have a lot of things on my mind,
they’re coming in, alright, they’re very upset, I’m trying to make some
sense…</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: All that I’m telling you: that one thing you
can tell them it’s a remarkable sale.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: The only thing remarkable is who you
made it to.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: What does that fucking mean?</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: That if the sale sticks, it will be a
miracle.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Why should the sale not stick? Hey, fuck
you. That’s what I’m saying. You have no idea of your job. A man’s his
job and you’re fucked at yours. You hear what I’m saying to you? Your
“end of month board…” You can’t run an office. I don’t care. You don’t
know what it is, you don’t have the sense, you don’t have the balls. You
ever been on a sit? Ever? Has this cocksucker ever been…you ever sit
down with a cust…</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: I were you, I’d calm down, Shelly.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Would you? Would you…? Or you’re gonna what,
fire me?</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: It’s not impossible.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: On an eighty-thousand dollar day? And it
ain’t even noon.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: You closed ’em today?</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Yes. I did. This morning. What I’m saying to
you: things can change. You see? This is where you fuck up, because this
is something you don’t know. You can’t look down the road. And see
what’s coming. Might be someone else, John. It might be someone new, eh?
Someone new. And you can’t look back. ’Cause you don’t know history. You
ask them. When we were at Rio Rancho, who was top man? A month…? Two
months…? Eight months in twelve for three years in a row. You know what
that means? You know what that means? Is that luck? Is that some, some,
some purloined leads? That’s skill. That’s talent, that’s, that’s…</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: …yes…</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: …and you don’t remember. ’Cause you weren’t
around. That’s cold calling. Walk up to the door. I don’t even know
their name. I’m selling something they don’t even want. You talk about
soft sell… before we had a name for it…before we called it anything, we
did it.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: That’s right, Shel.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: And, and, and, I did it. And I put a kid
through school. She…and…Cold calling, fella. Door to door. But you don’t
know. You don’t know. You never heard of a streak. You never heard of
“marshaling your sales force…” What are you, you’re a secretary, John.
Fuck you. That’s my message for you. Fuck you and kiss my ass. You don’t
like it, I’ll go talk to Jerry Graff. Period. Fuck you. Put me on the
board. And I want three worthwhile leads today and I don’t want any
bullshit about them and I want ’em close together ’cause I’m going to
hit them all today. That’s all I have to say to you.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: He’s right, Williamson.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: It’s not right. I’m sorry, and I’ll tell you
who’s to blame is Mitch and Murray.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Oh, Christ.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: The hell with him. We’ll go to lunch, the
leads won’t be up for…</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: You’re a client. I just sold you five
waterfront Glengarry Farms. I rub my head, throw me the cue
“Kenilworth.”</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Kenilw…</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: I own the property, my mother owns the
property, I put her into it. I’m going to show you on the plats. You
look when you get home A-3 through A-14 and 26 through 30. You take your
time and if you still feel.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: No, Mr. Roma. I don’t need the time, I’ve
made a lot of investments in the last…</p>
<p><strong>lingk</strong>: I’ve got to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Jim! What are you doing here? Jim Lingk, D.

<p><strong>roma</strong>: Yes.</p>

<p><strong>roma</strong>: Well, we’ll do that this weekend.</p>

<p><strong>roma</strong>: Beautiful. Beautiful rolling land. I was

<p><strong>levene</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Ray is director of all European sales and
services for American Ex… But I’m saying you haven’t had a meal until
you’ve tasted…I was at the Lingks’ last…as a matter of fact, what was
that service feature you were talking about…?</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Which…</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: “Home Cooking”…what did you call it, you said
it…it was a tag phrase that you had,,,</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Uh…</p>

<p><strong>roma</strong>: Well, Ray was eating at one of his company’s
men’s home in France…the man’s French, isn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: No, his wife is.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Ah. Ah, his wife is. Ray: what time do you
have…?</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Twelve-fifteen.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Oh! My God…I’ve got to get you on the
plane!</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Didn’t I say I was taking the two o’…</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: No. You said the one. That’s why you said we
couldn’t talk till Kenilworth.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Oh, my God, you’re right! I’m on the one…
Well, let’s scoot…</p>
<p><strong>lingk</strong>: I’ve got to talk to you…</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: I’ve got to get Ray to O’Hare… Come on, let’s
hustle… John! Call American Express in Pittsburgh for Mr. Morton, will
you, tell them he’s on the one o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: I’ll see you…Christ, I’m sorry you came all
the way in…I’m running Ray over to O’Hare…You wait here, I’ll…no. I’m
meeting your man at the bank… I wish you’d phoned…I’ll tell you, wait:
are you and Jinny going to be home tonight?</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Rick.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Kenilworth…?</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: I’m sorry…?</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Kenilworth.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Oh, God…Oh, God… Jim, excuse me…Ray, I told
you, who he is is the senior vice- president American Express. His
family owns 32 per…Over the past years I’ve sold him…I can’t tell you
the dollar amount, but quite a lot of land. I promised five weeks ago
that I’d go to the wife’s birthday party in Kenilworth tonight. I have
to go. You understand. They treat me like a member of the family, so I
have to go.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: It’s funny, you know, you get a picture of the
Corporation-Type Company Man, all business…this man, no. We’ll go out to
his home sometime. Let’s see. Tomorrow. No. Tomorrow, I’m in
L.A….Monday…I’ll take you to lunch, where would you like to go?</p>
<p><strong>lingk</strong>: My wife…</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Rick…?</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: I’m sorry, Jim. I can’t talk now. I’ll call
you tonight…I’m sorry. I’m coming, Ray.</p>
<p><strong>lingk</strong>: My wife said I have to cancel the deal.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: It’s a common reaction, Jim. I’ll tell you
what it is, and I know that that’s why you married her. One of the
reasons is prudence. It’s a sizable investment. One thinks twice…it’s
also something women have. It’s just a reaction to the size of the
investment. Monday, if you’d invite me for dinner again… This woman can
cook…</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: I’m sure she can…</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: We’re going to talk. I’m going to tell you
something. Because there’s something about your acreage I want you to
know. I can’t talk about it now. I really shouldn’t. And, in fact, by
law,</p>
<p><strong>i…</strong>: The man next to you, he bought his lot at
forty-two, he phoned to say that he’d already had an offer…</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Rick…?</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: I’m coming, Ray…what a day! I’ll call you this
evening, Jim. I’m sorry you had to come in…Monday, lunch.</p>
<p><strong>lingk</strong>: My wife…</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Rick, we really have to go.</p>
<p><strong>lingk</strong>: My wife…</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Monday.</p>
<p><strong>lingk</strong>: She called the consumer…the attorney, I don’t
know. The attorney gen…they said we have three days…</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Who did she call?</p>
<p><strong>lingk</strong>: I don’t know, the attorney gen… the…some
consumer office, um…</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Why did she do that, Jim?</p>
<p><strong>lingk</strong>: I don’t know. They said we have three days.
They said we have three days.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Three days.</p>
<p><strong>lingk</strong>: To…you know.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: No, I don’t know. Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>lingk</strong>: To change our minds.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Of course you have three days.</p>
<p><strong>lingk</strong>: So we can’t talk Monday.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Jim, Jim, you saw my book…I can’t, you saw my
book…</p>
<p><strong>lingk</strong>: But we have to before Monday. To get our
money ba…</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Three business days. They mean three business
days.</p>
<p><strong>lingk</strong>: Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>lingk</strong>: That’s what they are. Three business…I wait
till Monday, my time limit runs out.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: You don’t count Saturday.</p>
<p><strong>lingk</strong>: I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: No, I’m saying you don’t include Saturday…in
your three days. It’s not a business day.</p>
<p><strong>lingk</strong>: But I’m not counting it. Wednesday. Thursday.
Friday. So it would have elapsed.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: What would have elapsed?</p>
<p><strong>lingk</strong>: If we wait till Mon…</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: When did you write the check?</p>
<p><strong>lingk</strong>: Yest…</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: What was yesterday?</p>
<p><strong>lingk</strong>: Tuesday.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: And when was that check cashed?</p>
<p><strong>lingk</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: What was the earliest it could have been
cashed?</p>
<p><strong>lingk</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Today. Today. Which, in any case, it was not,
as there were a couple of points on the agreement I wanted to go over
with you in any case.</p>
<p><strong>lingk</strong>: The check wasn’t cashed?</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: I just called downtown, and it’s on their
desk.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Rick…</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: One moment, I’ll be right with you. In fact,
a…one point, which I spoke to you of which I can’t talk to you about
here.</p>
<p><strong>baylen</strong>: Levene!!!</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Listen to me, the statute, it’s for your
protection. I have no complaints with that, in fact, I was a member of
the board when we drafted it, so quite the opposite. It says that you
can change your mind three working days from the time the deal is
closed.</p>
<p><strong>baylen</strong>: Levene!</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Which, wait a second, which is not until the
check is cashed.</p>
<p><strong>baylen</strong>: Levene!!</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: I’m through, with this fucking meshugaas.
No one should talk to a man that way. How are you talking to me
that…?</p>
<p><strong>baylen</strong>: Levene!</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: …how can you talk to me that… that…</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Rick, I’m going to flag a cab.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: I didn’t rob…</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Shelly: get in the office.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: I didn’t…why should I…“Where were you
last…” Is anybody listening to me…? Where’s Moss…? Where…?</p>
<p><strong>baylen</strong>: Levene? Is this Lev…</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Ah. Ah. Perhaps I can advise you on that…
Excuse us, will you…?</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: …Come in here…I work here, I don’t come in
here to be mistreated…</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Go to lunch, will you…</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: I want to work today, that’s why I
came…</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: The leads come in, I’ll let…</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: …that’s why I came in. I thought</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Just go to lunch.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: I don’t want to go to lunch.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Go to lunch, George.</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: Where does he get off to talk that way to a
working man? It’s not…</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Will you take it outside, we have people
trying to do business here…</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: That’s what, that’s what, that’s what I was
trying to do. That’s why I came in…I meet gestapo tac…</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Excuse me…</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: I meet gestapo tactics…I meet gestapo
tactics…That’s not right… No man has the right to…“Call an attorney,”
that means you’re guilt… you’re under sus…“Co…,” he says, “cooperate” or
we’ll go downtown. That’s not…as long as I’ve…</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Will you get out of here. Will you get
out of here. Will you. I’m trying to run an office here. Will you go to
lunch? Go to lunch. Will you go to lunch?</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Will you excuse…</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: Where did Moss…? I…</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Will you excuse us please?</p>
<p><strong>aaronow</strong>: Uh, uh, did he go to the restaurant?</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: I’m very sorry, Jimmy. I apologize to you.</p>
<p><strong>lingk</strong>: It’s not me, it’s my wife.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: What is?</p>
<p><strong>lingk</strong>: I told you.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Tell me again.</p>
<p><strong>lingk</strong>: What’s going on here?</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Tell me again. Your wife.</p>
<p><strong>lingk</strong>: I told you.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: You tell me again.</p>
<p><strong>lingk</strong>: She wants her money back.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: We’re going to speak to her.</p>
<p><strong>lingk</strong>: No. She told me “right now.”</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: We’ll speak to her, Jim…</p>
<p><strong>lingk</strong>: She won’t listen.</p>
<p><strong>baylen</strong>: Roma.</p>
<p><strong>lingk</strong>: She told me if not, I have to call the
State’s attorney.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: No, no. That’s just something she “said.” We
don’t have to do that.</p>
<p><strong>lingk</strong>: She told me I have to.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: No, Jim.</p>
<p><strong>lingk</strong>: I do. If I don’t get my money back…</p>
<p><strong>baylen</strong>: Roma! I’m talking to you…</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: I’ve…look. Will someone get this guy off my
back.</p>
<p><strong>baylen</strong>: You have a problem?</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Yes, I have a problem. Yes, I do, my fr…It’s
not me that ripped the joint off, I’m doing business. I’ll be with you
in a while. You got it…? Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>lingk</strong>: I’m…</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Where are you going…? This is me…This is
Ricky, Jim. Jim, anything you want, you want it, you have it. You
understand? This is me. Something upset you. Sit down, now sit down. You
tell me what it is. Am I going to help you fix it? You’re goddamned
right I am. Sit down. Tell you something…? Sometimes we need someone
from outside. It’s…no, sit down…Now talk to me.</p>
<p><strong>lingk</strong>: I can’t regotiate.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>lingk</strong>: That…</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: …what, what, say it. Say it to me…</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: What…?</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: What…? Say the words.</p>
<p><strong>lingk</strong>: I don’t have the power. I said it.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: What power?</p>
<p><strong>lingk</strong>: The power to negotiate.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: To negotiate what? To negotiate what?</p>
<p><strong>lingk</strong>: This.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: What, “this”?</p>
<p><strong>lingk</strong>: The deal.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: The “deal,” forget the deal. Forget the deal,
you’ve got something on your mind, Jim, what is it?</p>
<p><strong>lingk</strong>: I can’t talk to you, you met my wife, I…</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: What? What? What, Jim: I tell you what, let’s
get out of here…let’s go get a drink.</p>
<p><strong>lingk</strong>: She told me not to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Let’s…no one’s going to know, let’s go around
the corner and we’ll get a drink.</p>
<p><strong>lingk</strong>: She told me I had to get back the check or
call the State’s att…</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Forget the deal, Jimmy. Forget the deal…you
know me. The deal’s dead. Am I talking about the deal? That’s over.
Please. Let’s talk about you. Come on. Come on. Come on, Jim. I want to
tell you something. Your life is your own. You have a contract with your
wife. You have certain things you do jointly, you have a bond there…and
there are other things. Those things are yours. You needn’t feel
ashamed, you needn’t feel that you’re being untrue…or that she would
abandon you if she knew. This is your life. Yes. Now I want to talk to
you because you’re obviously upset and that concerns me. Now let’s go.
Right now.</p>
<p><strong>baylen</strong>: Roma…</p>
<p><strong>lingk</strong>: …and…and…</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lingk</strong>: And the check is…</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: What did I tell you? What did I say about the
three days…?</p>
<p><strong>baylen</strong>: Roma, would you, I’d like to get some
lunch…</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: I’m talking with Mr. Lingk. If you please,
I’ll be back in. I’ll be back in a while…I told you, check with
Mr. Williamson.</p>
<p><strong>baylen</strong>: The people downtown said…</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: You call them again. Mr. Williamson…!</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Mr. Lingk and I are going to…</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Yes. Please. Please. The police can
be…</p>
<p><strong>lingk</strong>: What are the police doing?</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: It’s nothing.</p>
<p><strong>lingk</strong>: What are the police doing here…?</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: We had a slight burglary last night.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: It was nothing…I was assuring Mr. Lingk…</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Mr. Lingk. James Lingk. Your contract
went out. Nothing to…</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: John…</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Your contract went out to the bank.</p>
<p><strong>lingk</strong>: You cashed the check?</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: We…</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: …Mr. Williamson…</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Your check as cashed yesterday
afternoon. And we’re completely insured, as you know, in any case.</p>
<p><strong>lingk</strong>: You cashed the check?</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Not to my knowledge, no…</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: I’m sure we can…</p>
<p><strong>lingk</strong>: Oh, Christ… Don’t follow me…Oh, Christ. I
know I’ve let you down. I’m sorry. For…Forgive…for…I don’t know anymore.
Forgive me.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: You stupid fucking cunt. You, Williamson…I’m
talking to you, shithead…You just cost me six thousand dollars. Six
thousand dollars. And one Cadillac. That’s right. What are you going to
do about it? What are you goin to do about it, asshole. You fucking
shit. Where did you learn your trade. You stupid fucking cunt. You
idiot. Whoever told you you could work with men?</p>
<p><strong>baylen</strong>: Could I…</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: I’m going to have your job, shithead. I’m
going downtown and talk to Mitch and Murrray, and I’m going to Lemkin. I
don’t care whose nephew you are, who you know, whose dick you’re sucking
on. You’re going out, I swear to you, you’re going…</p>
<p><strong>baylen</strong>: Hey, fella, let’s get this done…</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Anyone in this office lives on their wits… I’m
going to be with you in a second. What you’re hired for is to help
us–does that seem clear to you?</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: To help us. Not to fuck us up…to help men who
are going out there to try to earn a living. You fairy. You company
man…I’ll tell you something else. I hope you knocked the joint off, I
can tell our friend here something might help him catch you. You want to
learn the first rule you’d know if you ever spent a day in your life…you
never open your mouth till you know what the shot is. You fucking
child…</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: You are a shithead, Williamson…</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Mmm.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: You can’t think on your feet you should keep
your mouth closed. You hear me? I’m talking to you. Do you hear me…?</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Yes. I hear you.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: You can’t learn that in an office. Eh? He’s
right. You have to learn it on the streets. You can’t buy that. You have
to live it.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Mmm.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Yes. Mmm. Yes. Precisely. Precisely. ’Cause
your partner depends on it. I’m talking to you, I’m trying to tell you
something.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: You are?</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Yes, I am.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: What are you trying to tell me?</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: What Roma’s trying to tell you. What I told
you yesterday. Why you don’t belong in this business.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Why I don’t…</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: You listen to me, someday you might say,
“Hey…” No, fuck that, you just listen what I’m going to say: your
partner depends on you. Your partner…a man who’s your “partner” depends
on you…you have to go with him and for him…or you’re shit, you’re shit,
you can’t exist alone…</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Excuse me…</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: …excuse me, nothing, you be as cold as you
want, but you just fucked a good man out of six thousand dollars and his
goddamn bonus ’cause you didn’t know the shot, if you can do that and
you aren’t man enough that it gets you, then I don’t know what, if you
can’t take some thing from that… you’re scum, you’re fucking white-
bread. You be as cold as you want. A child would know it, he’s right.
You’re going to make something up, be sure it will help or keep your
mouth closed.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Mmm.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Now I’m done with you.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: How do you know I made it up?</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: How do you know I made it up?</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: You said, “You don’t make something up
unless it’s sure to help.” How did you know that I made it up?</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: I told the customer that his contracts
had gone to the bank.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Well, hadn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: No. It hadn’t.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Don’t fuck with me, John, don’t fuck with
me…what are you saying?</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Well, I’m saying this, Shel: usually I
take the contracts to the bank. Last night I didn’t. How did you know
that? One night in a year I left a contract on my desk. Nobody knew that
but you. Now how did you know that? You want to talk to me, you want to
talk to someone else…because this is my job. This is my job on the line,
and you are going to talk to me. Now how did you know that contract was
on my desk?</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: You’re so full of shit.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: You robbed the office.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Sure! I robbed the office. Sure.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: What’d you do with the leads? You want
to go in there? I tell him what I know, he’s going to dig up
something…You got an alibi last night? You better have one. What did you
do with the leads? If you tell me what you did with the leads, we can
talk.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: I don’t know what you are saying.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: If you tell me where the leads are, I
won’t turn you in. If you don’t, I am going to tell the cop you stole
them, Mitch and Murray will see that you go to jail. Believe me they
will. Now, what did you do with the leads? I’m walking in that door–you
have five seconds to tell me: or you are going to jail.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: I don’t care. You understand? Where are
the leads? Alright.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: I sold them to Jerry Graff.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: How much did you get for them? How much
did you get for them?</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Five thousand. I kept half.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Who kept the other half?</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Do I have to tell you? Moss.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: That was easy, wasn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: It was his idea.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Was it?</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: I…I’m sure he got more than the five,
actually.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Uh-huh?</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: He told me my share was twenty-five.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Mmm.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Okay: I…look: I’m going to make it worth
your while. I am. I turned this thing around. I closed the old stuff, I
can do it again. I’m the one’s going to close ‘em. I am! I am! ’Cause I
turned this thing a…I can do that, I can do anyth…last night. I’m going
to tell you, I was ready to Do the Dutch. Moss gets me, “Do this, we’ll
get well…” Why not. Big fuckin’ deal. I’m halfway hoping to get caught.
To put me out of my… But it taught me something. What it taught me, that
you’ve got to get out there. Big deal. So I wasn’t cut out to be a
thief. I was cut out to be a salesman. And now I’m back, and I got my
balls back…and, you know, John, you have the advantage on me now:
Whatever it takes to make it right, we’ll make it right. We’re going to
make it right.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: I want to tell you something, Shelly.
You have a big mouth.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: You’ve got a big mouth, and now I’m
going to show you an even bigger one.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Where are you going, John?…you can’t do
that, you don’t want to do that…hold, hold on…hold on…
wait…wait…wait…</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Wait…uh, look… Look, twelve, twenty, two,
twen… twenty-five hundred, it’s…take it. Take it all… Take it!</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: No, I don’t think so, Shel.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: No, I think I don’t want your money. I
think you fucked up my office. And I think you’re going away.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: I…what? Are you, are you, that’s why…? Are
you nuts? I’m…I’m going to close for you, I’m going to… Here, here, I’m
going to make this office…I’m going to be back there Number One…Hey,
hey, hey! This is only the beginning…List…list… listen. Listen. Just one
moment. List…here’s what…here’s what we’re going to do. Twenty percent.
I’m going to give you twenty percent of my sales… Twenty percent. For as
long as I am with the firm. Fifty percent. You’re going to be my
partner. Fifty percent. Of all my sales.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: What sales?</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: What sales…? I just closed eighty-two
grand…Are you fuckin’…I’m back…I’m back, this is only the beginning.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Only the beginning…</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Abso…</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Where have you been, Shelly? Bruce and
Harriet Nyborg. Do you want to see the memos…? They’re nuts… they used
to call in every week. When I was with Webb. And we were selling
Arizona…they’re nuts…did you see how they were living? How can you
delude yours…</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: I’ve got the check…</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Forget it. Frame it. It’s worthless.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: The check’s no good?</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: You stick around I’ll pull the memo for
you. I’m busy now…</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Their check’s no good? They’re nuts…?</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Call up the bank. I called them.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: You did?</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: I called them when we had the lead… four
months ago. The people are insane. They just like talking to
salesmen.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Don’t.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Because I don’t like you.</p>
<p><strong>levene</strong>: John: John:…my daughter…</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: Asshole… Guy couldn’t find his fuckin’ couch
in the living room…Ah, Christ… what a day, what a day…I haven’t even had
a cup of coffee…Jagoff John opens his mouth he blows my Cadillac… I
swear…it’s not a world of men… it’s not a world of men, Machine… it’s a
world of clock watchers, bureaucrats, officeholders…what it is, it’s a
fucked-up world…there’s no adventure to it. Dying breed. Yes it is. We
are the members of a dying breed. That’s…that’s…that’s why we have to
stick together. Shel: I want to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>roma</strong>: I’ve wanted to talk to you for some time. For
a long time, actually. I said, “The Machine, there’s a man I would work
with. There’s a man…” You know? I never said a thing. I should have,
don’t know why I didn’t. And that shit you were slinging on my guy today
was so good…it…it was, and, excuse me, ’cause it isn’t even my place to
say it. It was admirable…it was the old stuff. Hey, I’ve been on a hot
