<p><strong>ext asbury park boardwalk - day</strong>: Jersey spring day.
Beyond the wooden planks that make up the aged fun pier, the ocean waves
crash into the sandy shoreline.</p>
<p><strong>oc voice</strong>: I don’t understand - how can you base your
lack of belief in God on the writings Lewis Caroll?</p>
<p><strong>int airport - day</strong>: LOKI walks beside a NUN in a
semi-busy terminal. They pass through the metal detectors. The Nun
carries a donation can.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Leaving ‘Alice in Wonderland’ aside, look
closely at ‘Through the Looking Glass’ - particularly ‘The Walrus and
the Carpenter’ poem: what’s the metaphorical meaning?</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: I wasn’t aware there was one.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Oh, but there is - it colorfully details the
sham that is organized religion. The Walrus - with his girth and
good-nature - obviously refers to either the Buddha, or - with his tusks
- the lovable Hindu elephant god, Lord Ganesha. This takes care of the
Eastern religions. The Carpenter is an obvious reference to Jesus
Christ, who was purportedly raised the son of a carpenter. He represents
the Western religions. And in the poem. what do they do? They dupe all
the oysters into followmg them. Then. when the oysters collective guard
is down. the Walrus and the Carpenter shuck and devour the helpless
creatures, en masse. I don’t know what that says to you, but to me it
says that following faiths based on these mythological figures insures
the destruction of one’s inner-being.</p>
<p><strong>oc loki</strong>: Organized religion destroys who we are or
who we can be by inhibiting our actions and decisions out of fear of an
intangible parent-figure who shakes a finger at us from thousands of
years ago and says “No, no!”</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: ‘Through the Looking Glass’ - a children’s
tale? I think not.</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: I’ve… I’ve never really thought about it like
that… What have I been doing with my life…?’.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Don’t look back. Just get out there and taste
life. Leave this for the unenlightened. Poverty is for the gullible -
it’s another way the church is trying to control you. You take that
money you’ve been collecting for your parish reconstruction and go get
yourself a nice piece of ass. You deserve it.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: Here’s what I don’t get about you: you
know for a fact that there is a God. You’ve been in his presence, he’s
talked to you personally. And yet I just heard you claim to be an
atheist.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: C’mon man - you know I don’t believe any of
that shit I was telling her. I just like to fuck with the clergy; keep
’em on their toes. When her head stops spinning, she’ll be facing the
way of the Just again. But oh. will she have a bunch to confess. Now
here’s what I don’t get about you: why do you feel the need to come here
all the time?</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: I like to watch. This is humanity at it’s
best. Look at them.</p>
<p><strong>oc bartleby</strong>: All that tension, all that anger and
mistrust, forgotten for one perfect moment when they come off that
plane. See those two? The guy doesn’t even know that the girl cheated on
him while he was away.</p>
<p><strong>oc loki</strong>: She did?</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: Uh-huh. Twice. But it doesn’t matter at
this moment because they’re both so relieved to be with one another. I
like that. I just wish they could all feel that way more offen.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Maybe if someone gave them free bags of
peanuts more often they would. Now what was so friggin’ important that I
had to miss cartoons this morning? If it was to share in your half-assed
obsessions with Hallmark moments, I’m going to slug you.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: You’re never going to believe this: we’re
going home.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Let me have some?</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: Look what somebody sent us in the
mail.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Did you say we’re going home? “Cardinal Glick
Cuts Ribbon on ’Catholicism - Wow!”</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: Keep reading.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: “Updating the church… television spots… Papal
consent… rededication… Again - and?</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: Give me this “The Re-dedication of Saint
Michael’s Church on it’s hundredth anniversary is the kickoff of a new
campaign that seeks to bring the Catholic Church back into the
mainstream. With a papal sanction, the archway entrance to the
centuryold, Jersey shore house of worship will serve as a passageway of
pleanry indulgence, which - according to Catholic beliefs - offers all
who pass through it’s arches a morally clean slate.” You still don’t get
it, do you?</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: No, I don’t get it. Are we leaving now?</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: If you walk through the church’s front
door on the day of the Re-dedication ceremony, your soul is wiped clean
of any and all existing sin, moreso than the sacrament of penance could
ever offer. It’s a plenary indulgence, man! I don’t know why I never
thought of this before.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Sounds thin. Sounds like someone made it
up.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: It’s rarely employed, but it’s legitimate.
It has a papal sanction for God’s sake.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: So you’re saying you and I can walk through
this doorway and go back home?</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: No - by passing through the doors, our
sins are</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Wait. wait, wait - Die? I don’t want to
die.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: You’d rather stay down here for a few more
eons?</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: No, but we don’t even know if we can die. And
what if we can, but this archway thing doesn’t pan out? What then? Hell?
Fuck that.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: Impossible. If we cut off our wings and
transubstantiate to complete human form then we become mortal. And if we
die with clean souls, there’s no way to keep us out. They have to let us
in.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Who sent this thing?</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: I don’t know. Somebody who’s looking out
for us,</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Yeah, but this plenary’ indulgence thing is a
church law, not Divine Mandate. Church laws are fallible because they’re
created by man.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: One of the last sacred promises imparted
to Peter the first Pope by the Son of God before He left was “Whatever
you hold true on earth…”</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: ” …I’ll hold true in Heaven.”</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: So if the Pope says it’s so, God must
adhere. It’s dogmatic law.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Let it never be said that your anal retentive
attention to detail never yielded positive results.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: You can’t be anal retentive if you don’t
have an anus.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: There’s just one thing I think I should do
before we leave - something that’Il get us back on His good side.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: This is something I’ve been dreaming about for
five years now. Read.</p>
<p><strong>oc bartleby</strong>: “Mooby the Golden Calf- Creating an
Empire Out of Simplicity.”</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: I want to hit them.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: Are you nuts?! We’re mere days away from
getting back, and you want to jeopardize it because you have a soft spot
for the good ol’ days?!</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: What better way to show I’ve repented than by
resuming the position I denied… thanks to you.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: A killing spree is not going to make
things better for us.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: We’re not talking about killing here. We’re
talking about Divine Justice. We’re talking about punishing the wicked,
raining down fire and brimstone. He’s all about that. I just know he’d
want this done.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: There hasn’t been an Angel of Death since
you quit. Doesn’t that mean anything to you? Besides, what if you’re
wrong?</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: If I’m wrong, it won’t matter. Like you said -
we pass through the arch and we’re forgiven anyway</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: Well… he does hate competition. And this
Mooby deninitely falls under that heading.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: The church we have to go to is where?</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: New ]ersey. The Rededication is in four
days.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Our last four days on earth. If I had a dick,
I’d go get laid. But we can do the next best thing.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Let’s kill people.</p>
<p><strong>opening credits</strong>: Between black cards with white
credits there are shots of the OLD MAN from the boardwalk being wheeled
into a hospital on a gurney, being treated in the emergeny room, being
hooked up to life support system, and finally resting in an intensive
care wing.</p>
<p><strong>ext st. stephen’s parish - day</strong>: The church sits on a
grassy knoll in Mc Henry - a suburb of Chicago. Some kids tear by on
bikes and egg it.</p>
<p><strong>oc priest</strong>: The greater Illinois chapter of the Right
to Life foundation will be holding it’s bi-annual softball game against
the Cook County Pro-Choice league next Sunday at two.</p>
<p><strong>int st. stephen’s parish - day</strong>: The PRIEST speaks
from the lectern, addressing semi-filled rows of the faithful.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Those who find the weekly demonstration
outside of</p>
<p><strong>oc priest</strong>: Today’s second collection will be donated
to the John Doe Jersey Life Fund. For those of you who haven’t been
following the news, an unidentified homeless man who was accosted and
severely beaten at the New Jersey shore last Tuesday lies in critical
but stable condition in one of that area’s hospitals. He lacks
identification and police have had no luck in tracking down any possible
family. While he shows no signs of recovery, the Arch-Bishop of the
Trenton Diocese has disputed the state’s decision to remove the indigent
man from life support systems, asking that Catholics all over the
country join in this protest against Euthanasia. And finally - will
whoever keeps parking in my spot, stop doing that. Thank you. Now,
please rise for the recession of faith. We believe in one God, the
father…</p>
<p><strong>oc voice</strong>: I don’t really want to be here.</p>
<p><strong>ent planned parenthood clinic - day</strong>: A small gaggle
of signcarrying RIght-to-Lifer’s march in front of the sterile looking
building.</p>
<p><strong>oc voice</strong>: But then again, I guess nobody ever does…
except maybe you.</p>
<p><strong>int bethany’s office - day</strong>: The source of the voice
- a GIRL - sits beside Bethany’s desk, stretching out her gum. Bethany
offers her an understanding smile.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: You know, I’ve done this three times now; and
each time the counselor tells me I should be more careful in the future,
I should show’ some responsibility. Gotta tell you, though - this is the
first time the counselor wasn’t some ugly as hell old bitch. It’s kind
of hard to take abortion advice from a woman who’s too gross to get laid
in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: I’m not here to lecture you - I’m here to
make sure you really want to go through with this.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I’d rather go back to that night when my idiot
bovfriend swore up and down he was sterile. Short of that, there aren’t
many choices left, now are there?</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Ever think about having it?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: What woman doesn’t on some level.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: I never did.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: You had an abortion?</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: My first year in college. All through high
school, I’d dated the same guy - Walter Flanagan. We were really in
love, right? So much so. that we decided to go Carnegie Mellon together…
that’s this college in Pittsburgh. So there we are -away at school, and
there’s suddenly no parents to worry about anymore, so we’re screwing
like rabbits - just constanly doing it. And I wound up getting pregnant.
So he begs me to have it. He says we should quit school and get married,
and I’m telling him that that’lI screw up our educations. We fought
about it for a week - my arguement being there was no rush to have kids,
you know? We could always have a baby in a couple of years - after
school. So I got the abortion against his wishes… I mean, what the hell
- it was my body, right? After graduation, we got married and
immediately set about trying to have kids. We tried like hell for the
first six months, and… nothing. So I went to a gynocologist to see if
everything was okay on my end. My uteran wall had this fissure. It seems
that the doctor who performed the procedure on me years before had
somehow botched it. I’d never be able to have a child.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: So there I am - devastated. And now I have
to go home to break the news to my husband who years before had begged
me to have the baby - his baby. And after I explain it to him through my
tears, he sits on the couch and rubs his eyes. And in the calmest, most
rational voice I’ve ever heard anybody use in my life, he asks me for a
divorce. And I fought him, you know? I tried to talk him out of it; told
him there were alternatives - like we could adopt. And all he said was
he wanted a wife who could have his children.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: He remarried. He had two kids in two years
with his new wife. We never spoke again. And now I do this.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: That’s like… such a sad story.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: I dated this guy a year or two ago - he was
really into comic books. He told me I had the stock superhero story -I
wanted to prevent a wrong that had happened to me from ever happening to
anyone else. Kind of like Batman, he said. The only difference is I
don’t put on tights to do it… unless all my other clothes are in the
wash. So… let’s go over your paperwork.</p>
<p><strong>ext clinic - day</strong>: A well-dressed LIZ maneuvers
through the small thrall of Right-to-lifer’s. They shake their placards
at her accusingly.</p>
<p><strong>protestor 1</strong>: You should be ashamed of yourself!</p>
<p><strong>protestor 2</strong>: Child killer!</p>
<p><strong>holy shit!! it’s the pope!!</strong>: As the thrall turns
excitedly in an effort try to spy the imaginary pontiff, Liz ducks
inside the clinic.</p>
<p><strong>int clinic coffee room - day</strong>: A NEWSPAPER HEADLINE
fills the frame - “CHURCH SAYS NO TO DEATH OF JOHN DOE”. It’s lowered to
reveal Bethany, reading. Liz enters and hangs up her coat.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Jesus! You’re a Catholic, aren’t you? Can’t you
talk</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: They hate me more than you, no doubt. At
least you have an excuse - you’re ]ewish,</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: I don’t think they’d accept that one - we
already used it as our excuse for killing Christ. So where were you
yesterday morning - a bunch of us went out for brunch?</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: I went to church.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: That kills me. You and church. We work in a
field that specializes in pissing off the cloth and you add insult to
injury by breaking bread with them every week.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: I sit there every Sunday and I feel
nothing. I can remember sitting in church when I was a kid and being
moved - like everything meant something, like I was important. And the
stories of all these holy people were so inspiring. Now I sit there and
think about my checking, and what I’m going to wear to work the next
day.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: So then why do you still go?</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: You wouldn’t believe me if I told you.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: You think I’m going to mock your religious
beliefs? We’re friends, Bethany - I may mock you for being a divorce’ at
twenty five who’s never had an orgasm, but I’d never mock you for having
faith.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: That’s just it - I don’t. I don’t think I
have any faith left.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: I had a girl in here once - ’bout fifteen. She
told me that faith is like a glass of water. When you’re young, the
glass is full, and it’s easy to fill up. But the older you get, the
bigger the glass gets, and the same amount of water doesn’t fill the
glass anymore. Periodically, the glass has to be refilled.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: A fifteen year old who came in here said
that?</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: She had gotten knocked up by her pastor.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Jesus! See? A minister knocks up a teenager
-isn’t anyone afraid of the Lord’s wrath anymore?</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: That would require faith, and that commodity
lately seems reserved only for the psychotic zealots that hang around
outside. So what are you doing tonight?</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Watching T.V.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Girl, you need a man. If only for ten
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: It’s been my experience that the average
male is never a man - not even for ten minutes in his entire life
span.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Uh-oh - that sounds militant. You thinking of
joining the other side?</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Couldn’t do it. Women are insane.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Then girl, you better get back to church and
ask God for a third option.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: I think God is dead.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: The sign of a true Catholic.</p>
<p><strong>int a quaint suburban home - day</strong>: The Stygian
Triplets kneel on one knee before a high-backed leather chair, upon
which Sits a shadowy figure who we see from behind. They appear to be in
a den or library.</p>
<p><strong>shadowy figure</strong>: All proceeds according to plan. No
doubt, the powers will attempt to contact the Last Scion. You know where
she is. She must be elliminated befoie she enters the frav. When she is
negated, there will be nothing to interfere with our plan. Shuffle her
loose her mortal coil, that we may obtain our final glory. Go.</p>
<p><strong>int bethany’s kitchien - night</strong>: The fridge door
opens and Bethany glances around inside. She pulls out a chocolate cake
and closes the door.</p>
<p><strong>int bethany’s living room - night</strong>: Bethany sits on
the couch, eating cake with a fork and watching the OC t.v. The theme
song to Filmation’s ‘Batman and Robin’ cartoon can be heard. She sips
some milk from a glass and has some more cake.</p>
<p><strong>int bethany’s bedroom - night</strong>: Bethany’s in bed,
staring up at the ceiling. From the darkness, a creaking floor board is
heard. Bethany reacts, grabbing a bat from under her pillow. She peers
into the darkness, defensively wielding her bat.</p>
<p><strong>voiceof the one true god!</strong>: The Voice repeats itself.
Bethany darts out of bed and dashes out of the room, quickly returning
with a fire extinguisher. While the voice is in mid-sentence, she blasts
the thing with the contents of the canister, swirling the nozzle around
to hit all the flames. The booming Voice sputters and starts coughing,
losing it’s impressive edge. Bethany stops squirting and turns on her
bedside lamp.</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: Sweet. ..Jesus! Did you… have to empty…the
whole can?!</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: I’m the one… who’s soaked and… she’s the
one who’s pissed. That’s rich!</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: I’m calling the cops! Breaking and
entering, attempted arson… they’re going to lock you up for life…!</p>
<p><strong>m etatron</strong>: No dial tone.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: You cut the phone lines… Get the fuck out
of here, now!</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: Or you’ll what - hit me with that
fish?</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: Now just sit down on the bed and shut
up!</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Oh God - you’re going to rape me…</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: I’m not going to rape you. Look at my
suit…!</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Take whatever you want, just don’t kill or
rape me…</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: Enough with the raping already! I couldn’t
rape you if I wanted to. Angels are ill-equipped.</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: See? I’m as anatomically impaired as a Ken
doll. You meat-puppets and your arrogance - you think everyone’s just
waiting to rape you.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Wh..what are you?</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: I’m pissed is what I am. You go around
drenching everyone that comes into your room with flameretardent
chemicals? No wonder you don’t get laid. Go get me a towel, will
you?</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: Stand back.</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: Like I was saying - I am the Metatron.</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: Metatron. Don’t tell me the name doesn’t
ring a bell?</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: You people. If there isn’t a movie about
it, it’s not worth knowing, right? I am a seraphim. The highest choir of
angels? You do know what an angel is, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: Metatron acts as the voice of God. Any
documented occasion when some yahoo claims to have spoken with God,
they’re speaking to me. Or they’re speaking to themselves.</p>
<p><strong>bet hany</strong>: Why doesn’t God speak for himself?</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: Ah. So glad you decided to join the
conversation. To answer that - human beings have neither the aural nor
the psychological capacity to withstand the awesome</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Are you going to kill me?</p>
<p><strong>beth any</strong>: Called how? How called?</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: All that from two words. Color this angel
impressed.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: How do I know you’re an angel?</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: Oh, you mean besides the fiery entrance
and the expansive wingspan? You people kill me. Fine. You want more
proof? How about a tequila?</p>
<p><strong>int mexican bar - night</strong>: Bethany and Metatron sit at
a table. Bethany immediately clutches at her pajamas. Metatron waves a
WAITER over.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Where the hell are we?!</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: The only place one can go for good
tequila. Dos tequilas, por favor. And an empty glass.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Si.</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: Gracias, senor.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: We’re in Mexico?!</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: Actually, we’re in the Chilli’s down the
street from your house, but it was You don’t mind that I lost the wings,
do you? I’m trying to keep our profile low.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: I suppose it would be too cliche to observe
aloud that this is the weirdest dream I’ve ever had.</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: Can you imagine how insulting it is to
converse with a person and have them insist you’re a dream? If I had an
ego, it’d be bruised.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: What do you want with me?</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: I’m to charge you with a holy crusade. You
do know what a crusade is, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Uh, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: Don’t give me that. Last time I charged
someone with a crusade they had to look the word up.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Why am I supposed to go on a crusade?</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: Your’s is a heritage divine. Also, you
didn’t seem to be doing much lately.</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: Oh - Gracias! One of the only things your
people have mastered since you crawled from the primordial ooze.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: I work in an abortion clinic.</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: Moses was a drunk. Look what he
accomplished. And no one’s even asking you to part an ocean. All you
have to do is go to New Jersey.</p>
<p><strong>beth any</strong>: New ]ersey.</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: Sure. Go to New Jersey and visit and small
church on a very important day. Agreed?</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: That doesn’t sound like a crusade.</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: Aside from the fine print, that’s it.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: What’s the fine print?</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>:
stopacoupleofangelsfromenteringandthusnegatingallexistence.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Wait, wait, wait. Repeat that.</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: Damn, this is good tequila?</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: The first part.</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: Details. Stop a couple of angels from
entering and thus negating all existence. God, I hate when people need
it spelled out for them.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Clarify that.</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: That’s the problem with you people - you
need every-thing clarified. No leaps of faith whatsoever. Alright -vou
want the whole secret origin? Here goes: Back in the old days, God was
vengeful and hot-tempered, and his wrath was bore by the Angel of Death
- name of Loki. When Sodom and Gommorah were destroyed? That was Loki.
When the waters wiped out everything with the exception of Noah and his
menagerie? That was Loki. And he was good at what he did. But one day,
he refused to bear God’s wrath any longer.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: Because he listened to his friend - a
Grigori by the name of Bartleby.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Grigori?</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: One of the choirs of angels. They’re
called Watchers. Guess what they do?</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: So they’re like Guardian angels?</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: Exactly like that, but different. So one
day, Loki’s wiping out all the first born of Egypt…</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: The Tenth Plague.</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: See? Tell a person you’re the Metatron and
they stare at you blankiy; mention something out of a Charlton Heston
movie and they’re suddenly theology scholars. May I continue
uninterrupted? So once he’s done with the first born, Loki takes his
friend Bartleby out for a post-slaughter drink. And over many rounds,
they get into this discussion about whether or not murder in the name of
God is okay. Now, Bartleby can run circles around Loki intellectually,
not to mention the fact that Loki’s more than half in the bag, and in
the end, Bartleby convinces Loki to quit his position and take a lesser
one - one that doesn’t involve slaughter. So - very inebriated - Loki
tells God he quits: throws down his fiery sword, gives him the finger -
which ruins it for the rest of us. because from that day forward, God
decreed that angels could no longer imbibe alcohol. Hence all the
spitting.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Sounds reasonable.</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: Maybe to you, but I’m a lush by
nature.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: I mean about the angel of Death’s
resignation.</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: For a liberal, yes, but this is the Angel
of Death we’re talking about. The Angel of Death can’t be a
conscientious objector. The Angel of Death is charged with meting out
whatever justice God demands. So for their insolence, God decreed that
neither Loki nor Bartleby would ever be allowed back into Paradise.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Were they sent to Hell?</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: Worse. Wisconsin. For the entire span of
human history. And when the world ends, they’ll sit outside the gates
for eternity.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: And what’s this have to do with me?</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: Somebody’s clued them in to a loophole in
Catholic dogma that would allow them to reenter Heaven.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: So what? They beat the system. Good for
them.</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: It’s not that simple. If they get in, they
will have reversed God’s decree. Now listen up because this part is very
important: existence in all it’s form and splendor functions solely on
one principle: God is infallible. To prove God wrong would undo reality
and everything that is. Up would become down, black would become white,
existence would become nothingness. In essence - if they are allowed to
enter that church, they’ll unmake the world.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Are these guys that bitter?</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: No, that’s the stupid part: they have no
idea what their actions will result in. As far as they know, they’re
just going home. Isn’t that sweet?</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: If this is so major, why are you talking to
me? Why doesn’t God do something?</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: He could. He could blink them out of
existence, destroy that church, turn them into plants. But He’d rather
see you take care of this one personally.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Why me?</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: Because of who you are.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: And who am I?</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: The girl in the p.j.’s. Don’t ask so many
questions just serve your purpose.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: I’ll pass.</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: I beg your pardon?</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: When some asshole abortion doctor destroyed
my uterus -where was God? When my</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: Do yourself a favor Bethany - do the world
a favor: let go of your petty crap. It’s served you precious little in
the past, and it serves you even less now when the fate of existence</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: A grudge? Do you know why I work in that
clinic? It’s my own private way of saying</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: And any other day I’d say that’s your
business and your life, and enjoy yourself and goodnight. But this isn’t
about you - this is about eve~body. So you lost the abiliry to make
life. You’re being offered the chance to play mother to the world by
acting like one and protecting it - saving it. But I can’t make you.
You’ll do what you will. However, if you should decide to stop being
selfish and accept your responsibility, you won’t be alone. You’ll have
support.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: What, more angels?</p>
<p><strong>nietatron</strong>: Prophets - although they don’t quite get
it yet. You’ll know them right away - one speaks, the other listens. The
one who speaks - and he will at great lengths, whether you want him to
or not - will make mention of himself as a prophet. The other one won’t
say anything, but he’ll be helpful</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Hey. You work for God.</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: They tell me it’s God. If it’s not, I’m
going to be severely pissed - what with all these years of bossing
people around on his behalf and expectorating perfectly good
tequila.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: What’s he like? God?</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: Lonely. But funny. He’s got a great sense
of humor.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: I’ll bet.</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: Look at sex. Sex is funny. One time I
asked him why you people had to look so stupid while procreating. He
said if you didn’t, you’d do it all the time, just for fun.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: But we do.</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: I know. And you all look so damn stupid
doing it. It kills us upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Sex is a joke in Heaven?</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: The way I understand it, it’s mostly a
joke down here too.</p>
<p><strong>int bethany’s bedroom - night</strong>: Bethany startles
awake. The radio on her night-table plays ‘Little Red Corvette’. She
lays back down.</p>
<p><strong>int bethany’s office - day</strong>: Bethany sits at her
desk, staring into space. A twenty-something girl speaks, butBethany’s
not really listening. She’s extremely preoccupied.</p>
<p><strong>int clinic - night</strong>: Bethany shuts off the lights in
the various rooms. She packs up her bag and turns on the alarm.</p>
<p><strong>ext clinic - night</strong>: Bethany exits and locks the door
behind her. She starts walking.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: God, what time do you people quit and go
home?! Let’s just save it for tomorrow, alright?</p>
<p><strong>go back to your paper routes, you punk fucks!</strong>:
Snoogans.</p>
<p><strong>small figure</strong>: Dude, I know they were just kids, but
we kicked their fucking asses!</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Where… where did you learn to do… that
stuff?!</p>
<p><strong>small figure</strong>: From this comic book some guys made
about us. Long story.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: I don’t know what to say… or think.</p>
<p><strong>small figure</strong>: Say you’ll offer us sex as a
reward.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>small figure</strong>: Jay. And this is my business
associate, Silent Bob.</p>
<p><strong>biethany</strong>: Well thank you for being out here so late…
Come to think of it, what are you doing out here so late? Wait a second
are you protestors?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: What’s a protestor?</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: You’re not with the Fight-to-Lifer’s?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: You mean those fucks with the signs and
pictures of dead babies? Shit no. Me and Silent Bob are pro-choice:a
woman 5 body is her own fucking business.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Then - I don’t mean to sound ungrateful -
but what are you doing hanging around?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: We’re here to pick up chicks.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: We figure an abortion clinic is a good place to
meet loose women. Why else would they be there unless they like to
fuck.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Oh. Right. Well, I should be going. Thanks
for the rescue… I think.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Wait, wait, wait - we just saved your ass, and
you’re just going to take off? What the shit is that?</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: I had a weird night last night, and now
tonight’s not shaping up to be any better. I think I should go home,
take some percosets, and lay down.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: How about that shit? Fuck this town, man - I’m
going back to Jersey and selling weed~ At least there I can get turned
down while trying to make myself a profit.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: You’ve gotta be kidding me.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Sorry. Would you… I can’t believe I’m doing
this… Would you… like to have a drink with me?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: See?! I told you if we hung around outside that
place we’d get laid! Thank you! Thank you, God!</p>
<p><strong>int seedy gun shop - night</strong>: Various guns are laid
out atop a glass case.</p>
<p><strong>oc salesman</strong>: Now this piece is nice. It’s not
lightweight, but one look at it and nobody - I mean nobody - is going to
fuck with you. Try it on.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: It’s a lot more compact than the flaming
sword, I’ll say that much.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: It’s the weapon of choice these days.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: It seems unimpressive. At least the sword
looked intimidating. How can I strike fear into the hearts of the wicked
with this?</p>
<p><strong>salesman</strong>: Oh, I get it. You want to become a
vigilante, right? Like Batman or something.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Batman never uses guns. I don’t know. It feels
impersonal.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: Then don’t use a gun. Just lay the place
to waste like Sodom and Gommorah. Now that was something.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Oh yeah, for you maybe. You got to stand there
and read. I had to do all the work.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: What work? You lit a few fires.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: I rained down sulfur, man. There’s a subtle
difference.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Are you kidding me? Any moron with a pack of
matches can start a fire. Raining down sulfur takes a huge level of
endurance. Mass genocide is the most exhausting activity one can engage
in, next to soccer. I’ll take this one.</p>
<p><strong>salesman</strong>: Five seventy five to walk with it right
now.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: Soccer?</p>
<p><strong>int diner - night</strong>: An English muffin is covered with
a knife-full of jam. Bethany raises the bread to her mouth and takes a
bite. She glances at the OC pair and stops chewing.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Are you both from around here?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: I’m hard as hell.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Do you live in the city?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Do you have a friend for Silent Bob, or are you
going to do us both? If so, I’m first. I hate sloppy seconds.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: You’re a man of principle. Where do you
come from?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: We used to live in a small town in Jersey. Real
small town. We practically knew everybody.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: What brought you to McHenry?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Hollywood.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Hollywood?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Oh yeah. See, we used to sell smoke in front of
this video store. And one day this fuck wants to rent a video. So we
did, only we didn’t have anyplace to watch it. So we went to the mall
and popped it into a VCR at Macy’s and sat on the floor and watched it.
It was called ‘Sixteen Candles’. Did you ever see it?</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: So the next day we rented ‘The Breakfast Club’,
and then ‘Weird Science’ where these two fucks have a chick that’ll do
anything for them and they don’t do nothing because it’s a PG movie. But
then we got thrown out of Macy’s when we watched ‘Pretty in Pink’,
because of this bitch.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: What’d you do?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: You know how at the end the red-headed bitch
gets together with her dream guy at the prom? Well pussy here starts
fuckin’ sobbing all sorts of loud and shit. And the manager’s like “Get
the hell out of here!” And I’m like “Fuck you, you bald cocksucker! I’ll
kick your lard..</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: So what exactly brought you to
Illinois?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Oh yeah. See, all these movies take place in a
town called Shermer, in Illinois. And there’s all this fine bush running
around, and we could kick all the dude’s asses because they’re all
whiney pussies. Except Judd Nelson - he was harsh. But best of all,
there was no one selling weed. So I says to Silent Bob “Man, we could
live phat if we were the blunt-connection in Shermer, Illinois!” So we
collected some cash we were owed, and caught a bus. But when we got
here,</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: And now you live here?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Fuck that. This berg sucks. Everyone talks with
a stupid accent so you don’t know what they’re saying, and it’s too
fuckin’ cold. We were talking about taking off. Until we met you, that
is.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Right. So how much longer are you staying
here?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Until you’re ready to skip out and make with
the sex.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: No. How long are you staying in
McHenry?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: We’re leaving tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Where are you going next?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Jesus - this broad asks alot of questions. Back
to Jersey. We’ve been going straight for like five</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Yeah. So do you do anal? Is it true that chicks
fart if you blast them in the ass?</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: I didn’t ask you out for sex.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: I’ll take head.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: I don’t know why, but… …I want to go with
you.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: What, like steady? You wanna be my girlfriend?
Alright, but Silent Bob has to live with us and you pay the rent.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: No, I want to go with you to New
Jersey.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Really? You’re the only chick I ever met that
wanted to go to Jersey. Most chicks try to get out.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: When can we leave?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Wait a second! What is this shit? Are we going
fuck or not?</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: You’re going to lead me somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Me lead you? Lady, I don’t even know where I am
half the time. If we’re not going to fuck then what the hell did you ask
me out for?</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Someone told me I’d meet you, and you’d
take me somewhere I was supposed to go. I didn’t believe it until you
said that thing in the parking lot.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: What the hell are you babbling about? All I
know is we saved your ass from some angry fucking dwarfs and you
promised us se~.. Didn’t this crazy bitch promise us sex? …and now
you’re telling me that I’m supposed to take you somewhere, and you don’t
even know where it is?</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Do you believe in God?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Holy shit - you’re a Jehovah’s Witness! All the
fine chicks that come out of that place, and we gotta get the one Jesus
freak! Let’s go…</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: No. wait…</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: I’ll scream rape.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: I can pay you.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Pay?</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: For being my guide. You were going to leave
anyway; all I’m asking is to tag along and see where it leads. I’ll pay
a hundred bucks and all expenses.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: I feel like I’m Han Solo, and you’re Chewie,
and she’s Ben Kenobi, and we’re in that fucked up bar. What about
sex?</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: No sex.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Alright, but let’s say we’re caught in a
situation where we’ve got like five minutes to live, like a bomb or
something is gonna go off - would you fuck us then?</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: In that highly unlikely situation? Yeah,
sure.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Yeah? You slut. Noonch. What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Alright. But I’ll drive.</p>
<p><strong>ext main highway - night</strong>: Bethany’s car roars
overhead, speeding down the road, reving awfully loudly.</p>
<p><strong>int bethany’s car - night</strong>: The speedometer reads
ninety five.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: What gear are you in?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Gear?</p>
<p><strong>ext highway - night</strong>: Jay, Silent Bob, and Bethany
sit on and against the car. The hood is open and smoke billows out.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Well what do I know from shifting?! Like I ever
drove before!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Chicks.</p>
<p><strong>int bus - night</strong>: Bartleby and Loki sit in the back.
Bartleby reads a map and Loki stares at the gun in his lap. A COUPLE
makes out in the seat in front of them.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: We have to pass through three more states
to get to New Jersey: Indianna, Ohio, and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: With a very important stop in Cleveland.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: Oh right. The Angel of Death Returns.
Sounds like a bad movie.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Movies are bullshit. And don’t start with me,
airight. The last time you bugged me about my job, you got us sentenced
to life in Wisconsin. All this time we’ve been down here, why didn’t we
ever leave the Cheese?</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: He said to stay where he put us. We feared
worse punishment if we disobeyed Him again.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Where were we afraid He’d send us?</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: New Jersey.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Now that, my friend. is irony.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: You know, maybe you’re wrong about this
slaughter. How can you even be sure of what incurs the Lord’s wrath
these days? Times change. Remember when eating meat on Friday was
supposed to be a Hellworthy tresspass? Or when people weren’t even
supposed to shop on Sundays?</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: That stuff was small potatoes. The major sins
never change. And believe me - I can spot a commandment breaker a mile
away.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: You don’t believe me? There. There’s one.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: So what? They’re kissing.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Adultery.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: That’s a stretch. How do you know they’re
not dating?</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: You’d know better than me - let’s hear it.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: Oh, I know the truth. But let’s see how
boned up on the job you really are.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: A test?</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: Of sorts. So what’s your proof?</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: He’s wearing a wedding band.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: So? Maybe that’s his wife.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: No married man kisses his wife like that. You
get married and the passion dies, man. Don’t you ever watch talk
shows?</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: A guy makes his best plays when wooing. When
the object of his desire is won, there’s no need to expend the effort
anymore. He relaxes, satisfied with the spoils of victory, which he then
decides isn’t so victorious because he’s saddled with a life-mate.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: Very romantic sentiment.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: That’s the problem - romance. You think about
it :back in the old days, nobody got married out of quote, unquote,
love. People married for property’, dowries, or to procreate - to
immortalize oneself through offspring. When did all this love stuff
start? What the hell happened to the status quo?</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: The Troubadors.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Lionel Richie’s old group?</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: No, that’s the Commodores. The Troubadors
were wandering minstrels and dramatists that sang melodramatic and sappy
songs of undying love.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Sounds like the Commodores.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: The Troubadors made ‘love’ fashionable.
And their influence altered the balance in a significant fashion. Until
them, people got married because they had to. After them, people started
‘falling in love’. Romantic courtships became the norm. What started out
as simple entertainment made such a dramatic impact as to forever alter
the way society operates.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: That’s human beings for you - easily misled.
From the Garden of Eden to the ‘Thigh Master’ - thev believe what
they’re told. I’m telling you - one day they’re all going to watch one
too many John Hughes flicks and start looking for Shermer, Illinois.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: Be fair. Humans are dumb, but not that
dumb. So is it adultery or not?</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Are you married?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Just curious.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: To her?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Are you married to her?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Not that it’s any of your fucking business, but
no! Why?!</p>
<p><strong>ext highway - night</strong>: The bus skids to a halt. People
flock off in a panic. scattering. After a beat, Bartleby and Loki
deboard and stand there alone.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: You’re such an asshole.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Don’t blame me, man. Blame the Commodores.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: Troubadors.</p>
<p><strong>ext roadside of highway - dawn</strong>: Silent Bob still
tools around under the hood, Jay hands him various wrenches. Bethany
steams off to the side.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: She’s pissed, dude. She’ll never fuck us now.
Well,</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Nobody is fucking me! You got that?!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: At least not in this car.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: I’m sorry I dragged you to that diner. I
don’t know what I was thinking. But being that I’ve decided to go home
and not to New Jersey, this is where you two get off.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: You’re breaking up with us?</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Good luck with finding Molly Ringwald, or
whoever it is vou’re looking for. Sorry for the inconvenience. Good
bye.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Who the hell do you think you are, lady? You
can’t go around breaking people’s hearts like that! We fell in love with
you! Guys like us don’t just fall out of the sky, you know!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: A beautiful, naked woman doesn’t just fall from
the sky, you know?! Was worth a try.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: No heartbeat.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Do you think he fell from a plane? Like
‘Alive’? Did you ever see that flick?</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: I think there would have been more of a
mess if he fell from that high.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Not necessarily.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: That sounds familiar.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Jesus, are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Rufus. And yes, I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: He’s the fuckin’ undead!! Cut his head
off!!</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: What happened to your car? You clock ninety
in first gear or something?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Mind your own fucking business!</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Listen, goldie-locks, what I just did was not
easy and it game a fucking migraine. Now if you don’t pipe down, I’m
going to rip your balls off.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: I knew it! Mother fucker wants to eat my
brain!</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: I think he was aiming a bit further south.
Speaking of which, you’re awfully nude - Rufus, is it?</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Rufus it is, Miss. Hey, tubby… how’s about
lending a brother your coat ’till I can find my own threads?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Dude, he fell out of thin air!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Dude, his dick is gonna be rubbing all over the
inside of your armor!</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: I’ll do my best to tuck it back, brother.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Where exactly did you fall from?</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Some might say grace.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Dude, he’s talking about your mom.</p>
<p><strong>oc bethany</strong>: You know, normally I’d have a hard time
with this, but somehow you falling out of the sky seems to go hand in
glove with some of the other stuff I’ve been deaiing with.</p>
<p><strong>oc rufus</strong>: Believe me - you ain’t seen nothing
yet.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Alright - what’s with you, lady?! That’s the
second time you got attacked by the fucking Mighty Ducks!</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Man, they’re onto you bad, already. I got
here just in time.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: How can you be so composed? We were almost
killed.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Death is a worry of the living. The dead only
worry about decay and necrophiliacs.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: See! I told you he was the undead!</p>
<p><strong>ru fus</strong>: Not the undead, the dead. I died. Christ
told me the secret to resurrection once when we were at a wedding in
Canna, but I got drunk and forgot it.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Wait. wait, wait - Christ? You knew
Christ?</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Knew him? I saw him naked.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Let me guess - you’re another angel?</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: No, I’m a man - just like you and him. Well,
maybe not like him. At least I was a man. Been dead for nearly two
thousand years. Here.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: No wonder he saw Jesus - homey’s rockin’ the
ganj.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: It’s not a joint. I can’t read this.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: It’s Sanskiit. It says “Rufus - see you in
two years. Jesus.” Freaked me out because he basically told me when my
number was up. Took the flavor out of the remaining years. Look, we
gotta keep moving. If we stay in one place long enough, those things are
liable to come back. What say we continue this discussion over something
to eat?</p>
<p><strong>wait a second!</strong>: I’m a rational woman, okay. All I
want to know is where you, and those… kids came from?!</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: They came from Hell. I came from Heaven.
Let’s start walking.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Walk? Do you know how far we are from
anywhere?</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Back in the old days with J.C., we walked
everywhere. Did you ever hear of a fat apostle? Bethany looks to Jay and
Silent Bob for some guidance or stability.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: What’s an apostle?</p>
<p><strong>ext mooby corp. building - dawn</strong>: A large office
building in downtown Cleveland. The city. hasn’t started up yet. A
pickup truck pulls curbside in front of the structure. Bartleby and Loki
jump out of the back and pat the side of the truck. offering waved
thank-you’s to the driver. As the truck pulls away, Loki pulls out the
article and looks at it. He looks up at the building and nods to
Bartleby, smiling. They head toward the front doors.</p>
<p><strong>figure</strong>: Hello?… No, they’re not in right now… I’m
the phone guy… I’ll leave them a message… Bye.</p>
<p><strong>figure</strong>: You say the girl has already met the
prophets?</p>
<p><strong>figure</strong>: She grows closer to learning her true
identity. If that happens, our plan is jeopardized. I can’t afford to go
into the field - that might compromise us further. The best course of
action is to insure that our parcel is not found. And being that I can’t
even trust you enough to kill a girl, I’m left with no choice but to
seek outside assistance in guarding our package. I’m going to have to
summon the Golgothan.</p>
<p><strong>ext fast food joint - dawn</strong>: Rufus - now wearing some
funky new clothes - carries a tray of fast food to an outdoor table.
Sitting already are Bethany, Jay, and Silent Bob.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: It’s amazing the shit people throw out.
Didn’t I tell you I’d find some threads?</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Thank you. What’s that mean?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: It means they saw you pull that shit out of
that dumpster.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: So it’s a good thing, then. I appreciate the
loan, brother. You can have this back.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Lucky you.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Damn, I remember when all we used to have for
breakfast was fish and goat’s milk. What do you call this shit?</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Egg McMuffin. Now how about you start
explaining some things to me.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Like - for starters - who the hell are
those kids that keep attacking me?</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Nasty little bastards called the Stygian
Triplets. They’re not really related. When they were alive they were a
trio of kids that snatched a neighbor’s toddler and smashed it’s skull
in - “just to see what it looked like” I believe was their defense. They
were killed in a car wreck on the way to a detention center.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: So they’re dead too?</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: You’d be surprised how many dead people are
just walking around - we’re stubborn bastards. Thing is, those kids are
supposed to be in Hell. Which means that someone wants you out of the
picture so badly they’re willing to summon demons.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Is it those two angels I’m supposed to
stop?</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Couldn’t be. They’re not evil - they’re just
stupid.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Wait a minute - are you going to listen to this
shit? We don’t even know who this guy is. For all you know, he’s in with
those fucks. They both showed up at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: I hate to say it - but he does have a
point. How did you know where to find us?</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: You know what the dead do with most of their
time? They watch the living. Especially in the shower.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: I can’t wait to die.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: And why are you watching me?</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Because you’re the one who’s going to help me
get some changes made in that book you all hold so much stock in.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Hustler?</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: The Bible.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: What’s your beef with the Bible?</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: I’m not in it.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Neither are any of us, but you don’t hear us
bitching.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: But I’m supposed to be in it. I was the
Thirteenth Apostle.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: I’ve been going to church my entire life
and I’ve never heard of a thirteenth apostle named Rufus.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: See? You know all about the other twelve
Apostles -white boys, I might add. But no mention of Rufus. And why?
Cause I’m a black man. But that’s just my pet peeve. I mainly want to
correct a major error that you people are basing a faith on.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Jesus wasn’t white; He was black.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Bullshit. I’ve seen pictures of Jesus, and He
has blonde hair and blue eyes.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: That’s what’s particularly insulting. Between
the time when He established the faith and the church started to
officially organize, the powers-that-be decided that while the message
of Christ was integral, the fact that He was black was a detriment. So
all renderings were ordered to be Eurocentric, even though the brother
was blacker than Jesse.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: If that’s true, then why’d He get written
about while you were left out?</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Well He is the Son of God, right? It’s kind
of hard to have the New Testament without him. So you fudge a few facts
and put a spin on His ethnicity. Leaving me out’s okay because there’s
still Twelve apostles to choose from.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: I don’t buy it.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: That’s what the good people of Antioch were
saying when they stoned my ass.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: You were martyred?</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: That’s one way of putting it. Another way is
to say I was bludgeoned to shit by big rocks. See - Christ told us
Apostles to go out into the world and spread His word. Antioch was
already garnering a big Christian following, so I got sent there. And
was a big hit. They loved hearing about Jesus’ message, and how He was
the Redeemer. But when I mentioned He was black, the whole town turned
on me - called me a liar and shit. I pressed the point, and before I
know it, I’m wearing stones - although not to accessonze.</p>
<p><strong>beth any</strong>: Why didn’t you just let the point go when
you saw how they were reacting?</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Because it’s part of the facts. White folks
only want to hear the good shit: life eternal, a place in God’s kingdom.
As soon as they hear they’re getting all this from a black Jesus, they
freak. And that - my friends - is called Hypocrisy. Folks just can’t
accept a black Savior. You going to eat that hash brown?</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: So you went to Heaven?</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Shit yeah; it was the least the brother could
do. I gave up my sheep and followed His ass around Jerusalem for three
years. And in all that time, did I ever get laid? Hell no! But I didn’t
bitch, because I was into His message. And while the message is what
counts, folks should know that He was black. That’s why I’m going to
help you find stop those angels from getting to that church in exchange
for you helping me with my campaign.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: How do you know about that?</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Heaven’s a pretty boring place, and anything
that breaks the tedium is news. The unmaking of existence is what you
might consider a great tediumbreaker. Besides, there isn’t much I don’t
know about you.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: I find that hard to believe.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: When you were five you let a kid from next
door piss on your hand.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: You did that?</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Yeah… but I never told anyone about it.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Neither did he. He died of Leukemia two years
later. His name was…</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: …BryanJohnson.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Your exploits - no matter how inane - are
well-known in Heaven. Probably in Hell, too.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Tell me something about me.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: You masturbate more than anybody else on the
planet.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Shit, everyone knows that. Tell me something
nobody knows.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: You think about guys when you do it.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Not all the time!</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: I’m sorty if I spooked you.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: I just feel… violated. Like my life isn’t
mine exclusively.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: That’s the way it goes with celebrities.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: What are you talking about? I’m a nobody.
I’m just a quiet girl from the suburbs who counsels pregnant teens.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: You sound like Christ. He had the same
reaction when He found out who He was, minus the quiet girl from the
’burbs angle. And like Him, I’m sure you’ll come to terms and do what
you’re supposed to.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Why not get the pope or someone holy like
that?</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Just because a guy wears a funny hat, doesn’t
make him the right man for the job. Only certain hands can deliver the
world from the brink of destruction. last time it was Jesus - this time
it’s you.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Why me?</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Can’t say yet. But the question is - are your
hands capable enough to carry the burden. It all rides on you.</p>
<p><strong>bftrany</strong>: Two thirds of me wants to forget about this
and go home. You know, yesterday I wasn’t sure God even existed. And now
I’m upto my ass in Christian Mythology.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: God hates it when it’s referred to as
Mythology.</p>
<p><strong>bfthany</strong>: Well then let’s ask the quote, unquote
‘prophets’ what we should call it instead. Now where did those two
assholes go?</p>
<p><strong>int strip joint</strong>: It’s your typical strip club. One
woman on a stage and a crowd of men paying way-too-much attention. The
place is dimly lit with red lights and chock full of smoke. Off to one
side, a dee-jay spins records, blasting the music. The crowd is rather
thin.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Proving to this bastard that I ain’t gay.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Long story - forget it. But we should get
moving. How can we get to New Jersey?</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: I had a car.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: We could go by train.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Sounds cool.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: There’s a phone out there. I’ll call for
reservations.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: No, it’s okay. I can handle it.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Sweet thing! Look what I found! Snoog!</p>
<p><strong>gang leader</strong>: You a smart ass, ain’tcha, white boy?
Come in here and ruin my good time.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: It’s a free country. The bitch just came to the
man with the most.</p>
<p><strong>dancer</strong>: Bitch?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: No offense, baby.</p>
<p><strong>gang leader</strong>: The bitch is gonna be leaving with the
man with the most - the man with the most led in his piece. While you
and tubby are leaving with the most led in your dead fucking carcasses,
know what I’m sayin?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Step to the side, baby. I’ve gotta slap this
pussyass, Nino Brown wanna-be down.</p>
<p><strong>dancer</strong>: Come on, Kane. This isn’t necessary.</p>
<p><strong>gang leader</strong>: Shut the fuck up and back away from the
midget!</p>
<p><strong>gang leader</strong>: Now I believe you were about to
apologize. I believe you were about to intone some pleas for mercy. You
were about to say “Please, Mister Kane, I didn’t mean to disrespect you
in your club. Please accept my most humble apology.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: You want an apology?</p>
<p><strong>gang leader</strong>: Give me at least one “I’m sorry,” and
ltll put a kill shot through that thick fucking skull of your’s.
Otherwise we go slow and long in the pain dispensation.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Know what I’m doing?</p>
<p><strong>gang leader</strong>: No. What you doing?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: I’m closing my jacket, so that when we start
this up, I don’t get your filthy fucking brain guts all over my shirt.
You know why?</p>
<p><strong>gang leader</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Because you can’t get shit stains out of
flannel. What I’m saying is that you got shit for brains.</p>
<p><strong>gang leader</strong>: Well I appreciate you breaking that
down for me, but I got it without the explanation.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: No. No, I don’t think you did get it. See,
there’s gonna he some nine’s firing in here, and when the bullets stop
flyin’, your cunt-lip ass is gonna be all holes and smoke. You think you
can draw on me and walk away? Fuck that. And fuck you - you punk-ass
monkey bitch! Yeah, I called you a monkey! Maybe if you kiss my dick all
nice before I cap you, I’ll bring a coconut to your funeral and lay it
on your grave; stick a straw through it and stick the other end in the
ground. Your lips’ll reach.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: You think every white boy cowers at your ass?
Shit, if I don’t fucking plant you - watermelon - my muscle here will.
What do you think he is? My boy friend? I love chicks. So he’s gotta be
with me for one reason: to watch my back. Silent Bob doesn’t talk in
words - he speaks in bullets. Re’s all quiet cause he’s thinking about
how he’s gonna take you and your bitches out quick enough to piss on the
bullets in your bodies before they cool down. You know why? Because he
likes to see the hot steam coming off them when he sprays them down.
Come to think of it, I~m tired of talking to your dumb ass; you probably
don’t even understand big words like ‘piss’. Tell you what - I’ll let
him explain it to you. Silent Bob - shoot these punk-monkey bitches.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: What are you waiting for?!</p>
<p><strong>you don’t rave a gun?!?</strong>: Silent Bob kind of nods</p>
<p><strong>have a gun?!?</strong>: Silent Bob indicates the negative,
sheepishly.</p>
<p><strong>hunhh?!?</strong>: Silent Bob raises his eyebrows
remorsefully. The Gang snickers and smiles.</p>
<p><strong>gang leader</strong>: What was that about a coconut?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: No gun! What the fuck kind of muscle are you?!
All this time and you got no gun!</p>
<p><strong>gang leader</strong>: Oh boys! We have some unfinished
business here.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Can we talk this over?</p>
<p><strong>gang leader</strong>: Tell you what - you got thirty seconds.
Then I cap you. Talk all you like.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: I can’t believe you. Do me a favor. Shoot this
piece of shit first. No gun!</p>
<p><strong>while we do our thang!</strong>: The Gang slowly goes from
perplexity to enjoyment. The Gang Leader softens and smiles, adding a
slight nod of approval. Jay provides back-up.</p>
<p><strong>na. na. na! gonna have a good time!</strong>: Bethany and
Rufus look on. amazed.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: I thought she looked familiar.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Serendipity.</p>
<p><strong>int. mooby corp. boardroom - day</strong>: Oh, this isn’t
your standard boardroom; this is Mooby Corp., home of Mooby, the Golden
Calf - which can only be described as a bovine variation on Barney:
sickeningly simple and very non-threatening. A large table sits in the
middle, a media center behind the huge chair at the head. The walls are
adorned with framed posters of Mooby, playing with kids, mouth agape in
a stupid smile. At the center of the table is a large, gold plated
statue of the insipid creature.</p>
<p><strong>whitland</strong>: Good morning, shoppers. Has anyone seen
the over-night’s?</p>
<p><strong>whitland</strong>: We creamed ’em.</p>
<p><strong>whitland</strong>: And last night was a rerun, which says to
me that with the six months we have to ready and promote the ‘Very
Nlooby Christmas’ pay-per-view special, we can produce history-making
numbers. The record is held by that shock-jock’s New Year’s thing, but I
see no reason why our little cash cow can’t supercede those numbers and…
Do I smell onions?</p>
<p><strong>whitland</strong>: I didn’t realize we had guests. Who are
these gentlemen with?</p>
<p><strong>whitland</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Hmm?</p>
<p><strong>whitland</strong>: May I ask what you’re doing in my
boardroom?</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: My friend just has a few words for you, and
then we’ll be on our way. Heading to Jersey, you see. Now -by the decor,
I assume I’m guessing correctly that this is the corporate headquarters
for Mooby Productions International?</p>
<p><strong>whitland</strong>: You guess correctly. Now, may I ask who
the fuck you are and - again - what the fuck you’re doing in our
conference room?</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: You may proceed, mon ami’.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: I can’t believe you. I just want to start
off by apologizing. My friend here has a penchant toward the dramatic,
so he’s making me do this. Usually, I don’t even involve myself in his
affairs, but he hasn’t done this in awhile, so he wants…</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Just read ’em their rights already.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: Mooby, the Golden Calf. Created by Nancy
Goidruff -a former kindergarten teacher - in nineteen eighty nine to
fill a gap in the Saturday morning schedule on local network K-REL
Bought by the Complex Corporation in nineteen ninety one and broadcast
nationally as the ‘The Mooby Fun-Time Hour’, it picked up a large
following of children, ages three to eight, and spawns sixteen records,
two theatrical films, eight prime-time specials, a library of
priced-to-own video cassettes, and bicoastal theme parks dubbed
‘MoobyWorld’. Did I miss anything?</p>
<p><strong>whitland</strong>: You forgot ‘Mooby Magazine’. Is there a
point to this?</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: You and your board are idolators.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: How could your forget the magazine?</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: It’s you. Do you know much about voo-doo?
Fascinating practice, very close to Satanism, but not really much of a
religion - no doctrine of faith. Just an arrangements of superstitions,
the most well- known of which is the voo-doo doll. A mock-up of an
individual is subjected to various pokes and prods, and the desired
result is that the individual will feel the effects.</p>
<p><strong>whitland</strong>: Call security - now.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: All lines are currently down.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: Again -. I apologize for my friend’s…</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Would you just get on with it?!</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: You are responsible for raising an icon
that draws worship from the Lord. You’ve broken the first commandment,
but more than that, I’m afraid none of you passes for a decent human
being. Your continued existence is a mockery of morality. Like you -
Mister Bernard. Last year you cheated on your wife of seventeen years,
eight times - twice with prostitutes. You even had sex with her best
friend while she was at her garden club meeting and you were supposed to
be watching your kids.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: In the bed you and your wife share, no
less.</p>
<p><strong>bartlby</strong>: And you, Mister Newman.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: You got your girlfriend drunk at last
year’s Christmas party, and then paid a kid from the mailroom to have
sex with her while she was passed out, just so you could break up with
her - guilt free - when she sobbingly confessed the next morning that
she cheated on you. She killed herself three months later. You sent
flowers to her wake.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: Mister Pereira disowned his gay son;
Mister Turran put his mother in a third-rate nursing home and used the
profits from the sale of her house to purchase an oriental rug for
himself; Mister Barker flew to the Phillipines on the company account to
have sex with an eleven year old boy; Mister Bloom okayed the production
of Mooby dolls from what he knew were unsafe and toxic materials because
it was less costly.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: You, on the other hand, are an innocent.
You lead a good life and have never misused your power here.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: But you, Mister Whitland. You have more
skeletons in your closet than this assembled party. I can’t even mention
them aloud.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: You’re her father, you sick fuck.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: Can I go now?</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Go on, you crazy kid.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: With the exception of Miss Pryce, there is not
a decent human being amongst you. Do you know what makes a human being
decent? Fear. And therein lies the problem. None of you has anything to
fear anymore. You rest comfortably in seats of inscrutable power, hiding
behind your false idol, far from judgement - lives shrouded in secrecy
even from one another. But not from God.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: I forgot my little voo-doo doll. Wow. It
really does look just like you. Maybe, if I believed enough…</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: I don’t believe in voo-doo.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: But I do believe in this.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: It’s okay. You’ve done nothing wrong. They
were bad men. You are a pure soul.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: But you didn’t say ‘God Bless You’ when I
sneezed.</p>
<p><strong>oc bartleby</strong>: Loki!</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Sorry. Force of habit.</p>
<p><strong>int strip joint - later</strong>: Jay and the Gang Leader sit
together at a table, surrounded by the other gangsters and Silent Bob.
They laugh and chug their ’40’s.</p>
<p><strong>gang leader</strong>: Watch this shit. Do it again, G. Do the
Mush-mouth.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Hey-buh, Fat-buh, Al-buh-bert.</p>
<p><strong>gangster 1</strong>: Fat Albert like a mother fucker and
shit!</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: I forgot you were down here! How long
now?</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: Three years this August. What about you
- is this another temporary expulsion? You and your ‘Christ was down’
campaign?</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: What does that mean - another expulsion? I
thought you came down here specifically to help me?</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: Is that what he told you? Rufus gets
thrown out constantly; at least once a month, ethereal time. They always
bring him back, but only after a few days of peace and quiet - free from
that black nationalist rhetoric.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Artsy-fartsy bitch.</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: Who you calling artsy-fartsy?</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Serendipity here used to hang with us
sometimes back in Jerusalem.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Let me guess - the fourteenth apostle; left
out of the bible because she’s a woman.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: The girl’s not a woman. No offense.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Oh, those weren’t tits I saw Jay cozying up
to?</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: What, these? You should know better
than anyone at this table that tits don’t make a woman.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Hell, the tubby, coat-wearing mother fucker’s
got tits - don’t make him a woman.</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: Aside from an intuitive knack for
accessorizing, what traditionally defines a woman falls between two
things : her legs. But as you can see…</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: I lack definition.</p>
<p><strong>oc jay</strong>: Hey! They’re getting a free show!</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Oh God. Another angel. Like Metatron.</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: How do you know Metatron? How does she
know Metatron?</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: This is the last Scion.</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: You’re kidding.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Don’t you see the resemblance?</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: A bit. Oh shit. If she’s been tapped,
then something’s up.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: I’m confused.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Bethany, Serendipity here isn’t technically
an angel, nor is she by any means a human being like I was and you
are.</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: Amen to that.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Then who is she?</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: Not who - what. I haven’t always been
part of the anthropomorphic club. I used to be an abstract.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Now I’m really lost.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Serendipity’s an idea.</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: Try all ideas.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Meaning?</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: I’m a muse, stupid.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: I can’t take much more of this.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: She’s now met a seraphim, a dead man, and a
muse.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: So you - what - inspire people?</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: What just went down with your friends
over there-you don’t think they thought of that themselves? I knew
Kane’s weak spot for Fat Albert and passed it along to the boys.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: If she hadn’t interceded, they’d be chalk
lines right now.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: You made them sing that song?</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: I offered them a solution out of the
hole they dug for themselves. Thankfully, they took it.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Are you kidding? Those two are so dense,
they wouldn’t get a good idea if it was given to them in a specially
marked box.</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: Dense people are the most open to
suggestion - it’s vou so-called intelligent folks that have a hard time
accepting a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Ain’t that the truth.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Prove it. Give me a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: If I do, and you accept it, then you’ll
have confirmation that you are - as you say - dense.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Alright. So you’re a muse. So what kind of
people do you inspire - besides stupid ones?</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: I used to specialize in entertainment -
literature, theatre, so forth.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Movies?</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: In some cases, I’d do everything but
bang starlets on the casting couch.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: What have I seen that you’ve been involved
with?</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: Off the top of my head - everything.
Well almost everything. For example: I’m responsible for nine of the ten
top grossing films of all time.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Nine?</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: The one about the kid, by himself in
his house; burglars trying to get in and he fights them off? I had
nothing to do with that one. Somebody sold their soul to Satan to get
the grosses up on that piece of shit.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Which brings us to the next logical question
- what are you doing stripping?</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: Well you remember why I left,
right?</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: You were tired of doing all the work and
getting none of the credit for your ideas.</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: And sick of watching incapable people
take brilliant inspiration and turn out real trash. So I opted to quit
being a muse and write for myself. I gave my two weeks notice. got a
body, fifty bucks, and got sent out into the world to make my
fortune.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: So what happened?</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: Writer’s block.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Writer’s block?</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: Can you believe it? Me - a muse, for
God’s sake! I sit down in front of the typewriter, and what do I get?
Nothing. Blank page. 1 can’t even write a grocery list.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: What about what you did with Jay and Silent
Bob? You inspired them.</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: That’s the cosmic joke. I can give out
a zillion and nine ideas a second, but I can’t keep any for myself. Her
quirky sense of humor.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Whose?</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: God’s.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: You’re saying God’s a woman.</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: Was there ever a doubt in your
mind?</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: The possibility never presented itself.
He’s always referred to as a Him.</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: I didn’t write it that way My job stops
at the idea stage. The person that holds the pen adds their own
perspective, and all the pen-holders were men. One of the drawbacks to
being intangible is that you have no say in the editorial process.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Another one’s that you can’t jerk off.</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: See. these being male-dominated times,
the Pharisees and High Priests felt threatened by the idea of a woman
lording over them and controlling their fates. so they made sure that
She became a He Doesn’t stop with God - the whole book is slanted and
gender-biased: a woman’s responsible for the first sin, the fall of man,
and the expulsion from Eden. a woman cuts Sampson’s coif of power, a
woman asks for the head of John the Baptist. Read that book again some
time - women are painted as bigger antagonists than the fucking
Egyptians and Romans combined.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: God is a woman…</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: I don’t know what the big surprise is -
women are the only gender that can create life, just like God created
the universe. Who else but a mother could have the infinite patience
with impudent children that God has with humanity. A woman can give
birth to and nurture both sexes, so psychologists theorize that women
are the only gender both sexes can feel completely comfortable with; and
the faithful - both male and female - feel at ease with God. In time of
trial, our first instinct is to implore the aid of the Almighty, just as
when you’re a child, the only person who can make it all better is…</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: …mom. God, it makes sense.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Shit, you still have a knack for words.</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: Not really useful in my new line of
work.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: What about that? Why’d you choose
stripping?</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: In an effort to create something
artistic that I could claim as my own. See, I’ve been able to fool
myself into thinking this isn’t stripping, it’s dancing; and at least
dancing is artistic. But She won’t even give me that much - the way God
designed dance, it’s the only creative act which results in no tangible
product. Unlike paintings, poems, movies or most other arts forms. when
the dance is over, there’s nothing to show for it - nothing to save and
enjoy… or sell. Believe me, the irony wasn’t lost on this muse.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: How long are you going to keep this up?</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: Believe me, I think about eating crow
and going back to the grind from time to time. But I’d hate to give Her
the satisfaction of my playing the prodigal. And it sucks because I
can’t stand being flesh anymore - especially this halfway crap. Not only
do I have to take care of the aesthetic - the showers, the haircutting,
the pit-shaving - but I can’t take advantage of the benefits - like
getting laid or using my period as an excuse not to get laid… …the only
true boon to having a period, from what I understand.</p>
<p><strong>rlfls</strong>: Well we could sure use your help. We need
someone with good ideas. You remember a couple of angels named Loki and
Bartleby?</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: Sure - the angel of death and his
squeamish pal with a conscience.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: They found a way back.</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: God no. Not the plenary indulgence loop
hole?</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: You know about that?</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: I always knew that thing was a bad
idea. Leave it to the Catholics to destroy existence.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Bethany’s Catholic.</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: My condolences.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: What do you have against Catholics?</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: Ever been to a Catholic mass?</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Once or twice.</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: It’s like bad sex - up, down, up, down,
kneel, leave.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: So if we’re so wrong, then what’s the right
religion?</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: When are you people going to learn?
It’s not about right or wrong - it’s a question of faith. It doesn’t
matter what you believe in - just that you believe.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Look! They made me and Silent Bob part of the
gang!</p>
<p><strong>figure</strong>: Not born… shit into existence.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Who farted?</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: Sweet Christ, someone wants you
bad.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: What do you mean? What’s that smell?</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Don’t tell me that’s who I think it is.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Who the hell is it?!</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: An excremental - the Golgothan.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: A what?</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: A shit-demon.</p>
<p><strong>no-man</strong>: No… man. ..of…woman.. born…</p>
<p><strong>gang leader</strong>: Friend of your’s?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Is this smelly fuck with us?</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: He’s coming for Bethany.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Smoke that mother fucker like it ain’t no
thang!</p>
<p><strong>gang leader</strong>: I knew I’d get to wax someone today.
Represent!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: I guess we’re in charge of the gang now.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: What the fuck happened?!?</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: Go for the bar. We might have a few
seconds - his short-term memory’s for shit.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: So’s the rest of him.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: No chance of taking him down?</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: Gee. I don’t know. Let’s ask the
gangstas.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: You’re right; let’s book.</p>
<p><strong>shit!!!</strong>: Everyone leaps behind the bar. The shit
flies over them and slams against the mirror above. Immediately, it
stretches - Blob-like - over the entire frame, and burns in an acidic
fashion.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Now that… is some powerful shit.</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: Quick! Get in!</p>
<p><strong>int basement</strong>: Our heroes cower beneath the floor
door.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: What is that thing?</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: You ever hear of Golgotha?</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Skull place. The hill where Christ was
crucified.</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: Yeah, well it wasn’t just Christ up
there - the Romans crucified everybody on that hill. Ahd Christ
excluded, they were all criminals - killers, brigands, thieves, rapists.
And whenever the crucified expired, their bodies would naturally lose
muscle control, spilling bowel and bladder in the process. And the
result is that walking pile of crap up there: the Golgothan Shit-Demon -
Hell’s chief assassin. And he’s here for you, girlie.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: What are we doing down here, then?. Any
second now he’ll be blasting through that door!</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: Shit’s brainless. If we can sit tight
for a couple of minutes, he’ll forget what he came for.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Looks like it’s been taking memory training
courses…</p>
<p><strong>jump!!!</strong>: The five leap from their perch on the
steps, just as the doors explode, dumping a torrent of crap on the
steps. The body of muck morphs into NoMan anew. NoMan lumbers toward
them. The group, attempting to gain their bearings on the floor, crawls
backwards. NoMan pulls a piece of himself off, rolling it around in It’s
hands.</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: If anybody still remembers any prayers,
I suggest you start whipping them out.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Bob, get down! Jay!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: You tubby retard! Get your ass back on the
floor!</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: ‘Knocks strong odors out.’</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Way to go. tubby.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Why would you ever carrs this?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Who has dominion over this thing?</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: Only Lucifer can order a killing. But
something doesn’t make sense: this thing never travels alone - with it’s
intelligence level, Lucifer’d never allow it. It usually has some kind
of backup.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Can you get some answers?</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: I can give it a shot.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Serendipity’s going to talk to that
demon.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Cool! Can we watch?</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: Not a good idea. Demon’s can wreak
havoc on the weak-minded.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Fuck you - weak-minded! Me and Silent Bob can
talk to him in his own language! See…? he’d understand this.</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: Whoever sent this might send mor~. I
suggest you take the princess and get as far away as possible. I’ll do
what I can to extract some info from shit-boy here. If there’s anything
helpful. I’ll get it to you somehow.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Thank you. And… you’re a great dancer.</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: I’m a better juggler. You know you’re
supposed to be prophets. right? Start acting like prophets. You should
have seen that thing coming.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Why the hell are we getting yelled at?!</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: Just watch out for Bethany. Go.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Man, bitch thinks just ’cause she’s
good-looking, she can tell us what to do.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: She told me that if you behave, she’ll give
you head.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Yeah?.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Oh, a demon’d have a field day with
you.</p>
<p><strong>oc jay</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>oc bethany</strong>: You shut up.</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: Nice girl.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Comes from good stock.</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: You haven’t told her yet?</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Not the right time.</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: How uncanny is the resemblance? Those
eves, the lips…</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: The nails.</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: Blasphemer.</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: Shit. You’d better go. I’ll take care
of the trash.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: Alright, Stinky - let’s see what you
know.</p>
<p><strong>ext church -day</strong>: A suited MAN stands at a podium,
addressing a small thrall of reporters.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: And now, to speak on behalf of his Holiness’
‘Catholicism - Wow!’ campaign, ladies and gentlemen of the press, I give
you the driving force behind the movement - Cardinal Glick.</p>
<p><strong>glick</strong>: Thank you, Mister Flanagan - one of this
parish’s chief patrons, who donated the stained-glass likeness of Our
Lady of Gleeful Misery that welcomes you as you enter the church every
Sunday. Ladies and Gentlemen of the press - few would deny that the
Catholic Church has fallen behind somewhat in the times. Catholicism
usually strikes the average person as an old-fashioned remedy for the
ills - both moral and psychological - of a society that has since left
it’s stringent rules and ornate rituals on the heap with 45’s and eight
track cassettes. And in an effort to disprove that, the Church has
appointed this year as a time of renewal, both of faith and of style.
So, it is with great pleasure, that I present you and your parish - mere
days away from it’s centennial celebration - and the continental United
States, via Satellite with the first of man revamps that the
‘Catholicism -Wow!’ campaign will unveil over the next year. Now, what
does this mean for the average church-goer? Are we going to throw out
the rule book and adopt a hippie mentality in regards to our faith?
No. We’re simply talking about a few minor alterations to both the
aesthetic and theoretical aspects of a religion that boasts one of the
highest membership numbers on the planet.</p>
<p><strong>glick</strong>: Thank you, thank you. So what are we talking
about here. Well, for example… while it has been a time-honored and
traditional symboL of our faith, we have decided to retire the highly
recognizable, yet wholely depressing symbol of our Lord, Jesus Christ,
crucified. Why? Well, look at it. Would you relish being a member of a
group that uses a man nailed to two pieces of wood as it’s masthead? Of
course not - who would? I’ve got enough downers in my daily routine
without having to deal with this visual everytime I go to worship.
lnstead, the church is going to adopt this new, more soothing and
inspiring sigil, which we feel is in-line with our new outlook.</p>
<p><strong>glick</strong>: See? Isn’t this better? How could you not
feel just great walking into a church and seeing this behind the priest
- a positive reinforcement that whatever we do, God thinks is ‘a~kay’. I
love this thing, it’s so…</p>
<p><strong>reporter i</strong>: Cardinal Glick - has the church given
any thought to it’s position on john Doe Jersey? Will he be given the
right to die with dignity?</p>
<p><strong>glick</strong>: C’mon people. We’re not here to talk about
that. It’s an issue we stand firm on - euthanasia is a big no-no, just
like abortion. Murder’s murder. Why won’t you people accept that?
Besides, we’re here to talk about this little guy - your friend and
mine… the happy Jesus. Can’t you just see it on chains around people’s
necks, and as the new background in avant garde, MTV videos?</p>
<p><strong>int bus terniinal - day</strong>: The image of the ‘Happy
jesus’ - thumbs up and all - is captured on a t.v. monitor, a label
reading U'E VIA SATELLITE - RED BANK. NEW JERSEY’ at the bottom of the
screen. Bartleby and Loki look up at it, then at one another.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: And you say Siskel and Ebert have no influence
over this culture.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: We’re getting out of here at just the
right time. These people are nuts.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: And that’s the church we’re heading to?</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: If you want to go home… Two tickets to New
Jersey, please.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Jersey’s sold out, sir.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: The computer says.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Come on - how many people can possibly be
going to New Jersey?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Enough to fill a bus.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: You had to drag that judgement out. You
couldn’t just hit and run. When’s the next one?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Same time tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: What?! Doesn’t this place warrant at least
two buses a day?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: I take it you’ve never been to the Garden
State. Next.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: There’s no one else here.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Then I guess it’s lunch time.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: We should have learned to drive a long time
ago. Infinite celestial power and we can’t catch a bus.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: Just shut up, this is your fault.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: You can either lament over our mass transit
folly, or you can listen to my suggestion.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: It’s your suggestions that prevent us from
negotiating what should be a simple matter of catching or staying on a
bus!</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Why fall victim to gravity when we can just as
easily rise above?</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: Fly?</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: We got wings, right? Let’s use them.</p>
<p><strong>oc voice</strong>: I wouldn’t suggest that.</p>
<p><strong>azrael</strong>: You wouldn’t want to stand out, now would
you?</p>
<p><strong>int strip joint basement - dusk</strong>: NoMan is tied to a
chair in the middle of the floor. Serendipity draws a circle around him
with lipstick. Once finished. she takes a glass of water and throws it
into No Man’s face. It roars to life. The Golgothan shakes of his daze,
turning his attention on Serendipity.</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: Matter of perspective. NoMan. I like to
think of it as ‘down here’. I have a few questions for you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: Okay. Oh wait. I’m smarter than
that.</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: Face it, big guy - I’m not releasing
you until I get answers. This can go hard or easy. The sooner I get what
I want, the sooner you’ll be free. Now, you can start by telling me why
you’re on this plane?</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: See? That wasn’t so hard. Now - who
sent you? Was it Lucifer?</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: Did Bartleby and Loki send you?</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: She, you chauvinist bastard - She’s
brain dead. And no She’s not. Stop trying to be so spooky. Tell me who
sent vou, or I’ll use whatever influence I have below’ to make Hell even
worse for you.</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: What do you mean. gone? He escaped?</p>
<p><strong>int toy store - day</strong>: Azrael leads Bartleby and Loki
through the aisles, passing tons of stuffed animals.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: Jesus Christ, Azrael - how’d you get out
of Hell?</p>
<p><strong>azrael</strong>: I told them I was coming up on a routine
possession. I don’t have much time. If they figure out my ruse, they’ll
come looking for me.</p>
<p><strong>bartleiby</strong>: You lied?</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Go figure. Him. A demon. Why’d you bring us in
here?</p>
<p><strong>azrael</strong>: Because you two fucks are inches away from
getting yourselves caught. Going around killing people, about to uncase
your wings… don’t you have any idea what’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: We’re going back home.</p>
<p><strong>azrael</strong>: Are you so clueless as to think you can just
waltz back into Heaven?</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: Why not? We’re going back clean.</p>
<p><strong>az rael</strong>: Let me let you in on a little secret, okay:
everyone is looking for you. Both sides - above and below. The orders
are to terminate you on sight.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>azrael</strong>: You’re pissing people off, that’s why! Word
on the grapevine is that God’s pissed off at your presumption, and I
know Lucifer’s pissed because you assholes might just succeed where he’s
failed so many times, making him look bad.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: So they’re going to kill us?!?</p>
<p><strong>azrael</strong>: They’re going to try’. That’s why you have
to travel incognito - tone down your behavior, stay off their respective
radars. Go about this thing more subtly. Quit killing people - that’s
high profile. And for God’s sake, don’t uncase your wings until you have
to transubstantiate. Because the minute you let them flap, legions of
thrones and hordes of demons will fight each other over who gets to kill
you first. Shhhh!</p>
<p><strong>daughter</strong>: Mommy, that man had horns.</p>
<p><strong>azrael</strong>: That’s the kind of shit I’m talking
about!</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Oh, lighten up.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: I can’t believe they want to kill us.</p>
<p><strong>azrael</strong>: Believe it, boys. They’ve even got the Last
Scion looking for you.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: You’re kidding!</p>
<p><strong>azrael</strong>: This is big. I’m telling you. Your re-entry
is a thorn in a lot of sides, and they’ll stop at nothing to prevent
it.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: If that’s the case, then why aren’t you
hunting for us too?</p>
<p><strong>azrael</strong>: Because I want to see you go back. You were
both given a raw deal; almost as raw as mine. If you make it back, then
I figure there’s hope for me. In the meantime, I suggest you find an
alternate mode of transportation. If anything else comes up, I’ll
contact you.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: Thank you, Azrael. You’re a true
friend.</p>
<p><strong>azrael</strong>: Would you expect anything less from a demon.
I have to get back to the Pit, before they get suspicious.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Hey Az - what’s it like down there. Is it as
bad as they say?</p>
<p><strong>azrael</strong>: Give you a hint: they’ve been playing
‘Mrs. Doubtfire’ continuously for two years now.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Shit man - that is punishment.</p>
<p><strong>ext contryside - night</strong>: The Train chugs through the
darkness.</p>
<p><strong>int train - night</strong>: Bethany and Rufus sit across from
one another. They stare out the window.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: How you coping, kid?</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: It’s weird. just when I think I’ve got a
handle on things. something wholely unbelievable presents itself.
Sometimes I wish I had just stayed home.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: You sound like the Man.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: What was He like?</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Jesus? Black.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Besides that.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: The brother was centered. I mean, He was God,
right? But I think He felt left out because He was more than human, you
know? We used to sit around the fire - me and the other guys - and we’d
be talking about what ass-holes the Romans were or getting laid…</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Some things never change.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: …and He’d just sit there listening and
smiling. We’d ask Him why He never joined in the convo, but He said He
just liked to hear us talk; about anything. Said it was like music. I
think He just wished He had unimportant shit to talk about himself.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: How does He feel now?</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: He still digs humanity, but it bothers Him to
see the shit that gets carried out in His name - wars, bigotry, but
especially the factioning of all the religions. He said humanity took a
good idea and, like always, built a belief structure on it.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Having beliefs isn’t good?</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: I think it’s better to have ideas. You can
change an idea. Changing a belief is trickier. Life should malleable and
progressive; working from idea to idea permits that. Beliefs anchor you
to certain points and limit growth; new ideas can’t generate. Life
becomes stagnant. That was one thing the Man hated - still life. He
wanted everyone to be as enthralled with living as He was. Maybe it
had</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: He was big on life?</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: It was more than that. He was the only person
I ever knew who never engaged in that most ancient of life-affirming
activities.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Sex.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Debate. That’s the only way people know how
to reaffirm that they’re alive - by debating. In all it’s forms. People
spend their whole lives debating: we fight about who’s right and who’s
wrong, we fight ourselves, we fight each other, we fight death, we fight
over beliefs, we fight over fights. We believe that to stop debating -
in any fashion -is to stop living and give up. People say that life’s a
struggle, but it’s not. Life is living. I’m even guilty of it myself,
the way I go on about Christ’s ethnicity, fighting for the truth to come
out. And I’m dead. Even in death, the only way I know how to live is
through debate. That’s sad, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>betiiany</strong>: Not if you believe it’s important for
people to know.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: A belief’s a dangerous thing, Bethany. People
die for it. People kill for it. The whole of existence is in jeopardy
right now because of the Catholic Belief structure regarding this
plenary indulgence bullshit. And whether they know it or not, Bartleby
and Loki are exploiting that belief, and if they’re successful, you, me.
all of this… ends in a heartbeat. All over a belief.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: I haven’t seen the moron twins in awhile.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: They went to the lounge car to smoke. I’ll
go find them; make sure they’re not getting into any trouble.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: I’m going to catch a few z’s. Forgot how
tiring living can be.</p>
<p><strong>int lounge car - night</strong>: Bethany enters and spots jay
and Silent Bob, talking to an unseen party.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: You two aren’t getting into any trouble,
are you?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Nope. Just about to smoke a bowl with our new
friends. You in?</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: And who are your new friends?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: They just got in at the last stop.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: This is Larry and Barry.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Jay tells us you’re going to sleep with
him.</p>
<p><strong>ext train tracks - night</strong>: The train rushes over
head.</p>
<p><strong>int lounge car - later</strong>: Loki, Jay, and Silent Bob
pass a joint under the table and take quick hits, trying to remain
casual. Jay pounds the table happily.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: You can smoke up with them if you want. You
don’t have to keep me company.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: It’s a long trip. There’ll be plenty of
time later. So why are you heading to Jersey?</p>
<p><strong>betrany</strong>: There’s just this thing there I’m supposed
to do. How about you?</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: We’re going home.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Do you two live together?</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: Unfortunately. Do you live with those
guys?</p>
<p><strong>b ethany</strong>: God, no. Not they just sort of adopted
me.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: They’re funny as hell. The big one never
says a word.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: I wish the little one would take a cue from
him. But they’re okay, as far as stoner’s go.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: Lo… Larry’s taken an immediate shine to
them, and he usually hates people.</p>
<p><strong>betiiany</strong>: How long’ve you two been together?</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: Awhile. He’s great company. He can be a
little flaky sometimes, but we’ve got a lot in common.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: How’d you meet?</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: We were stationed together.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: See? That’s beautiful. And everyone’s
always up-in-arms about this ‘out-in-the-military’ issue.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Well there’s all that macho bullshit about
it being ‘This Man’s Army’. And you two meet and hook up while in the
service, which is so special - because it’s so hard to meet anyone you
can seriously relate to…</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: You think we’re lovers?! Oh no. No, we’re
not gay.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Oh God, I’m sorry’. I just assumed…</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: No. We live together and all, but at the
end of the night, I go to my room. and he goes to his. Why? Do I come
off as gay?</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: No, not at all. I’m sorry. My ex-husband
kind of fouled up my relationship awareness barometer.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: You’re divorced?</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: That’s the nice way of putting it. I
consider it being dumped.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: I was dumped once. More or less.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: It’s terrible, isn’t it? Don’t you
constantly question your value - like why was I so easy to cast aside?
Didn’t I have merit?</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: And you wonder if the other party’s going
to come to their senses and call you back.</p>
<p><strong>betiiany</strong>: The worst is that I still think like a
couple. After all these years, I still have the ‘we’ mentality.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: Mine grew out of what was really a stupid
misunderstanding. A misunderstanding that grew into a total withdrawl of
communication. Abandonment. And even though it was years ago, there’s
not a day that goes by that I don’t wonder what went wrong. And then it
hits me - I was replaced by someone. A lot of someones.</p>
<p><strong>bet hany</strong>: And they always tell you it’ll hurt less
with time…</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: …when actually, it hurts more.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: You know what we need? We need some drinks.
A lot of drinks. Do you agree?</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: Whole-heartedly.</p>
<p><strong>int train car - night</strong>: Rufus continues to
slumber.</p>
<p><strong>int lounge car - night</strong>: Jay is asleep on Silent
Bob’s shoulder, drooling slightly. Loki talks with Silent Bob.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: I’m telling you, man - it’s all about
organized religion and society’s battle against it. The Rebels are
fighting the Empire, right? Now the Empire is led by whom? Darth Vader?
No. It’s led by the Emperor. And the Emperor is a practitioner of the
Force, albeit the Dark Side of the Force. And the Force is basically a
religion. So the entire galaxy is under Imperial rule, and the Imperial
government is run by this old religion. What you have, then, is a
theocratic government - a government run by the church. So Luke, Han,
and Leia are fighting that government to liberate the galaxy from the
pious grip of what is, in essence, holy mother church.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: You’re saying you still go to church?</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Every Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: Does it do anything for you?</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Gives me time to balance my check book
every week.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: See? That’s what I’m talking about. People
don’t go to church and feel spiritual. They go to church and feel bored.
But they keep going. Every week. Out of habit.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Or in habit, if you’re a nun.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: Oh… that wasn’t very funny at all.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: A friend of mine told me that church is
like bad sex:it’s messy and there’s no foreplay… No. that’s not it. I am
so buzzed.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: When do you think you lost your faith?</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: I remember the exact moment. I was on the
phone with my mother, and she was trying to counsel me through what was
happening to me and my marriage. And she said something like “There’s
always a plan.” And I… just got so angry. I mean, I know she was talking
about God, right - God had a plan. But I was like “What about my plans?”
You know? Like, don’t they count for anything? I had planned to grow old
with my husband and have a family - wasn’t that plan good enough for
God? Apparently not. How about you? When did you lose your faith?</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: Me? Years ago. One day, God just stopped
listening. I kept talking, but I got the distinct impression that He
wasn’t listening anymore.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: She. And how do you know She was listening
in the first place?</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: I guess I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: I hate thoughts like that. But they occur
to you with age. When you’re a kid, you never question the whole faith
thing - God’s in Heaven, and He’s… She’s always got her eye on you. I’d
give anything to feel that way again. Which is why I guess I let myself
get talked into this pilgrimage. I needed proof. And the opportunity
presented itself to find out if it is like they told us in Catholic
school. And I gotta tell you - the last few days, I’ve come across some
interesting people that lend toward convincing me.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: Where’s this pilgrimage to?</p>
<p><strong>int train car - night</strong>: Rufus stirs. He looks around
and stretches.</p>
<p><strong>int lounge car - night</strong>: Bethany and Bartleby
continue their discussion.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: You’d never believe me if I told you.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: Try me.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Alright. But I warned you. Okay - I’m going
to this church in New Jersey.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: Really…</p>
<p><strong>int train car - night</strong>: Rufus heads toward the back
of the car. He opens the door between the cars and exits.</p>
<p><strong>int lounge car - night</strong>: Bethany and Bartleby talk
further. Bartleby’s intrigued.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: I was told that I’m supposed to stop a
couple of angels from entering the church. They’re trying… This sounds
so stupid… They’re trying to get back into Heaven.</p>
<p><strong>int train car - night</strong>: Rufus passes through another
car and opens the door at the end.</p>
<p><strong>int lounge car - night</strong>: Bartleby grows very tense.
Bethany rattles on, half-toasted.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: See, they got tossed out of Heaven years
ago, right? And if they get back in, it proves God wrong. And since God
is infallible, to prove Her wrong would… ..would unmake existence! I
feel so stupid just saying it.</p>
<p><strong>betrany</strong>: But the thing I don’t get… is how do I stop
an angel? Two, even! I guess I’m supposed to talk them out of it or
something.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: Maybe you’re supposed to kill them?</p>
<p><strong>int train car - night</strong>: Rufus pulls open another door
and exits.</p>
<p><strong>int lounge car - night</strong>: Bethany’s still cracking up,
oblivious to the on-the-defensive Bartleby.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Oh yeah! Kill them! Even if that was the
case… I mean. how do you kill an angel?</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: I don’t imagine it’s much different… …from
killing a human…</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Where the hell is everybody? I wake up,
and…</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: The Apostle!</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Holy shit!</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Rufus, I want you to meet my friend,
Barry…</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Barry! Don’t be such a show off!</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Take it easy, Bartleby. Just let her go and
let’s talk about this.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: After all this time, this is what it comes
down to -slaughtered by this meat puppet?!</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: There doesn’t have to be a slaughter. We can
work this out…</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Is that a knife?</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: Oh. we can work it out, alright. I’m going
to work the blade in and out of her thorax! Loki!</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Holy shit - the Apostle!</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: They’re here to thwart our journey home,
my friend. This one just told me that she’s supposed to stop a couple of
angels from entering a church.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: You think she was talking about us?</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: I’d say there was a pretty good chance.
What do you say, Rufus - we’re to be liquidated?</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: It doesn’t have to go down like that! You
haven’t thought about the consequences of re-entry!</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Consequences, schmonsequences.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: I have to agree with him. No one - not
you, and especially not this finite-lifer - no one is going to impede
us. We’re going home, regardless of whose pride it may hurt!</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: It’s not a question of pride, it’s…</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: Loki - kill the girl</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: What are you, high?</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: Do it!</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: I can’t kill her if she hasn’t done anything,
you know that. And it looks like she’s ‘on the job’, so to speak…</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: Fine! I’ll kill her myself…</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Hey man - now it’s your turn. We got enough for
a fatty boom-batty, biggety blunt!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: We having cake or something?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: In grates…</p>
<p><strong>tubby! the door!</strong>: Silent Bob jumps over Loki and
opens the back door of the car. He grabs Loki by the collar.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Wait, man! Can’t we talk about this?!</p>
<p><strong>silent bob</strong>: No ticket.</p>
<p><strong>beth any</strong>: I should have known something was wrong
when he paid for all the drinks.</p>
<p><strong>int underground garage - night</strong>: A door is kicked
open. Loki enters, brushing himself off. Bartleby follows.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: The Apostle is here!</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: I noticed.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: If that’s the case, then chick with him must
be…</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: The Scion, I’d imagine.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Well, shit man! Maybe we should rethink this
whole thing! I mean, you heard the guy - he said there were
consequences. Azrael tells us we’re marked. Maybe there’s more to this
than we thought about.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: There sure is. It’s them.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: Them.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: The movie about the giant ants?</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: Them - the humans. It’s what it all comes
down to. you know? Us against humanity… kind of like that giant ant
movie.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: I’m better than alright. I’ve had an
epiphany, my friend.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: An… epiphany. Yes, well… that’ll happen.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: When that sweet, innocent girl let her
mission slip, I suddenly understood it all - everything. For the first
time in all these eons, I get it.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Get what?</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: In the beginning, it was just us and Him.
Angels and God. And then He created the humans. And He gave them more
than He ever gave us. Our’s was designed to be a life of servitude and
worship - adoration. But He gave the humans more - He gave them a
choice. They can choose to ignore God, choose to acknowledge Him. All
this time we’ve been down here, everyday I felt the absence of the
Divine presence. And it pained me… as I’m sure it must have pained you
sometimes, even though you’d gloss over it with jokes. But we feel his
absence, and why? Because of the way He made us -as servants. Had we
been given free will, we could ignore the pain… like them.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: You know - maybe you should take a nap or
something.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: Loki, don’t you get it? It’s the humans -
it’s always the humans. They were given paradise; they threw it away.
They were given this planet; they destroyed it. They were favored best
among all His endeavors; and some of them don’t even believe He exists.
Their ego-mania corroded Hell and made it dark and crimson. I asked you
to lay down your sword years ago - why?</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Wait, wait, wait - kill them?! You’re talking
about the Last Scion, for Christ’s sake! And what about Jay and Bob - I
mean, those guys were alright.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: Don’t, my friend. Don’t let your
sympathies get the best of you, as they did me way back when. Scion or
not, she’s just a human. And regardless, our sins are forgiven by
passing through that arch. No harm, no foul.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: That sounds thin.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: Fine. We’ll cover ourselves. We’ll take
out a slew of people. Maybe amidst the body count, He won’t notice.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Oh, that’s being realistic.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: I’m going home, Loki. And nobody - not
even the Almighty Himself - is going to make that otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>ext camp fire - night</strong>: Another Newspaper headline
regarding ‘John Doe Jersey’ fills the frame. It is lowered to reveal
Jay, Bethany, and Rufus sitting around a makeshift fire in the middle of
nowhere. Jay rolls a joint. Silent Bob reads the paper.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: I don’t understand why we couldn’t stay on
the train. You threw those guys off.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: A very basic strategy - if your enemies know
where you are, then don’t be there.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: And what’s with that? Why are we enemies?
The guy almost gutted me, for God’s sake!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: He had the knife at your throat. To gut you,
he’d have to have the knife at your stomach.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Semantics! Semantics that don’t even answer
mv question.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Well, I know I’d perceive the person sent to
kill me as my enemy.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: What do you mean, kill? I wasn’t asked to
kill them -just stop them from going into that church.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: And how were you going to do that? Preoccupy
them with a game of Bingo?</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: I’ve never killed anything before in my
life!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: I’ll do it.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Shut the fuck up, little man - you couldn’t
kill a pint of ice cream, let alone an angel.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Fuck you - I can kill an angel as good as the
next guy.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Oh yeah? How’ would you do it?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: I’d give him a Van Damme neck-break, like in
‘Hard Target’. D’jou see that flick?</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Killing an angel’s a two-step process - first
you have to cut off their wings. which then makes them human. From that
point on, it’s the same as killing anything else - head or heart, take
your pick.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: You say it as if it’s easy.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Problem is, I don’t think we could pull it
off even if we wanted to. All this time away from the Divine Presence
should have made those two weaker - and those guys felt far from weak.
Either that or someone’s protecting them - someone with juice.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: So then we’re screwed? Shit, that’s the
best news l’ve heard in days.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: This doesn’t excuse you from tryng to stop
them.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Count me out. You’re telling me they’re
unstopable, I’m exhausted - both psychologically and physically, the
odds are against us. I say we kick back and wait for the end -a little
non~xistence might be just what the doctor ordered.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: I’m with her. I don’t care about dying, so long
as we’re all going to die.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: What are you babbling about now?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: If I was the only one, that’d bother me because
every-one else would go on living, having a good time without me. But if
we all go at once, that’d be okay, because I know I’m not missing
anything.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: See? You know it’s right when even he’s
making sense.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Besides, she said if we were in a situation
where we were going to die in like five minutes, she’d have sex with me
and Silent Bob.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: So you’re suggesting she throw in the towel
and let eons of work and history get blinked out of existence just so
you can get laid?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: No. Just so me and Silent Bob could get
laid.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Now that we’re all but in total agreement
on this, I’d just like to finally know - why me?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Because you’ve got nice tits.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: I wasn’t talking to you! Why me? Why do I
have to do this? Nobody’s come</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Family ties.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: That show’s funny as hell.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Shut up. Do you know what the Apocryphal
books are?</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Most of that information in the Bible came
from the Dead Sea Scrolls - ancient text discovered in a cave ages ago.
And when the Sanskrit was translated, they discovered data that
conflicted with the lore church officials had already established as the
basis of their religion. They couldn’t refute centuries of dogma, so
they thought it best to leave certain passages out - sometimes whole
books. Those books make up the Apocrypha.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: What’s this have to do with me?</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: You’ve never gotten the complete picture. If
they had compiled the material together like they were supposed to,
you’d get the whole story. But by leaving text out, the church has
presented you people with an extremely sterile and unmoving account of
religious history. The Creation. the entire Old Testament, the history
of Christ… Forget about my whole black angle for a minute…</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: We might if you’d quit bringing it up.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: He goes from twelve years old to thirty.
Whole volumes of text about the eighteen year struggle with His Divine
nature prior to His acceptance of it were thown out, forever lost to the
faithful.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: I don’t buy it. Integral material like that
would give people a better understanding of the nature of God. Why leave
it out?</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Because it was all closely tied in with His
family.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: His mother and father?</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: His brothers and sisters.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Wait, wait, wait - Jesus didn’t have any
brothers or sisters. Mary was a virgin - that’s why it’s called the
Immaculate Conception.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Mary gave birth to Christ without having
known a man’s touch - that’s true. But she did have a husband. And do
you really think he’d have stayed married to her all those years if he
wasn’t getting laid? The nature of God and the Virgin Birth - those are
leaps of faith. But believing a wife never humped her husband - that’s
just gullibility.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: All the time, from what I understand. Jesus
used to tell me stories about hearing them through the walls when He was
a kid. So you ask why you got tapped. I’ll tell you why: a Christ was
the salvation of this world once before. And you’re the closest thing to
a Christ that still walks.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Meaning?</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: The blood that flows in your veins shares a
chromosome or two at the genetic level with the man you call Jesus.
You’re His great-grand-niece.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: So… that would make Bethany part black. Man,
this is just like when Vader told Luke he was his father.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: I just wish I knew what the hell we’re
supposed to do now?</p>
<p><strong>oc voice</strong>: You must go to the Dagobah system and find
Yoda - the Jedi Master who instructed me.</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: God. l’ve always wanted to say that.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: The voice.</p>
<p><strong>nietatron</strong>: The Apostle!</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Now you show up! Where were you when that
psychotic bastard had a knife to my throat?</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: I told you you’d be in capable hands -
you’re not dead are you?</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: What are you doing here anyw’ay?</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: I felt left out. Everyone’s sitting around
coming clean, I thought I’d join in with a confession of mine own.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Now who’s this mother fucker?</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: This is the Voice of God - show some
respect.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: The Voice of God? Where’s the rest of Him?</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: Funny you should mention that - we’re not
sure.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: Didn’t it ever occur to you that this
Bartleby/Loki situation was well within the realm of His control?</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: If that’s the case, then why was Bethany
tapped?</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: You know those constitutionals He likes to
take?</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Constitutionals?</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: I think we’re beyond euphemisms at this
point. God’s a skee-ball fanatic.</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: Let’s not altogether blow some of the
mystery that surrounds Him, alright? Yes - the Lord has quite a fancy
for the game; been playing it for years - He assumes a human form once a
month and indulges. Doesn’t tell anyone where He’s playing; just goes
away for a couple of hours. It’s quite understandable - a small exercise
in hand/eye coordination has been proven as a highly effective means of
therapeutic relaxation. And from what I understand, He always gives his
free points away to neighborhood children. Isn’t that sweet?</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: But She hasn’t come back from one of those
day-trips, is what you’re getting at?</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: ‘She’? I take it she’s met the Muse. No,
‘She’ hasn’t. And we’ve been unable to locate Her.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Maybe He was killed? Human form has that
drawback.</p>
<p><strong>m etat ron</strong>: No - there’s a different sort of
foul-play afoot, children. Whomever has set the renegade angels on their
path and is keeping them quite well-hidden. is also responsible for the
Lord’s whereabouts. Were He to be killed in human form, He’d have
immediately returned to Paradise. Somebody knew enough to keep the body
alive, but incapacitate Him in another fashion - He’s trapped in a
body.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: So God’s not dead…</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: He’s brain dead.</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: So it would seem. And as omnipotent as we
are above, I have to admit that we’re more or less lost without His
presence. We’ve had our people looking everywhere for Him. And I tapped
her, because I thought we might be able to smoke out whoever’s behind
this. But whoever it is has been clever enough to send some lackeys
after you, as opposed to showing up themselves.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Can it be Lucifer?</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: Thankfully they seem oblivious to the
situation in the nether-regions. I know they’re not responsible - at
least not Lucifer. If he was, he’d have made his move by now to conquer
Heaven. And I know he’s not responsible for Bartleby and Loki because
he’d have just as much to lose by their return as everyone else.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Then what about the Golgothan and the
Triplets?</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: Don’t be stupid - demons aren’t exclusive
to Hell. Anybody can summon one.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Don’t encourage them. And why did you lie
to me? You said I was tapped as a test?</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: No, you said that - I just didn’t correct
you. You were shocked enough - how do you think you would’ve taken it if
I told you the face of God belonged on the back of a milk carton?</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: So what do we do now?</p>
<p><strong>m etat ron</strong>: I say we get drunk, kids - because I’m
all out of ideas.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Why don’t we just ask this guy to close the
church?</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: I beg your pardon?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: ‘Glick Takes Heat for Campaign’?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: It’s the guy in charge of the church thing.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: ‘Cardinal Glick has come under fire for the
blatant pandering and questionable direction of his church-sanctioned
’Catholicism - Wow!’ campaign. When asked about his motivations for
decommisioning the traditional baptismal fonts in favor of the proposed
Olympic sized lap-pools beneath parish floors, Click responded “Come on
- who doesn’t like a pool party?”</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Maybe you could tell him to shut down the
church. If it’s closed on that day, those guys can’t get blessed or
whatever - right?</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: Good Lord - he’s got a point.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: I think Silent Bob had a point. But sure -
we can go to him and explain the situation somehow.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: ‘We’? You’re back in?</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Well, mine is a heritage Divine… and I
wouldn’t want to let down the family.</p>
<p><strong>metatron</strong>: Well, well, well - the prophets finally
live up to their titles.</p>
<p><strong>television screen - commercial</strong>: Two cartoon ALTAR
BOYS sift through their bowls of cereal.</p>
<p><strong>altar 1</strong>: The same boring cereal again?</p>
<p><strong>christ</strong>: Man cannot live on boring cereal alone!</p>
<p><strong>it’s jesus!</strong>: Jesus pulls a box of HOSTIES cereal
from his sash.</p>
<p><strong>christ</strong>: Why not try Hosties!</p>
<p><strong>christ vo</strong>: New Hosties is fortified with vitamins
and minerals, topped off with an angelic kiss of frosting that stays
crispy in milk!</p>
<p><strong>christ</strong>: Hosties is an important part of any
nutritious breakfast, and each one is blessed by a high ranking Vatican
Monsignor - good for the body, and good for the soul. But make sure
you’ve confessed beforehand…</p>
<p><strong>altar 2</strong>: I… I touched… m..myself! I’m…s…sorry…</p>
<p><strong>christ</strong>: You’re forgiven.</p>
<p><strong>christ</strong>: So try a bowl of Hosties! And don’t just
take my word for it…</p>
<p><strong>pope</strong>: They’re Heavenly!</p>
<p><strong>int click’s office - dlsk</strong>: A hand switches off the
t.v. Pan up to Cardinal Click, all smiles.</p>
<p><strong>glick</strong>: Well…? Doesn’t it pop?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Does it come in chocolate flavor?</p>
<p><strong>glick</strong>: You see? Now this one’s got vision! We’re
rolling out the flavors in September. Big cereal month with the kids,
back to school and all.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: It’s a bit… startling.</p>
<p><strong>glick</strong>: Exactly! And that’s what we’re looking to do
- shake these people up a bit, get them motivated. That’s the whole
point of the campaign. Mass attendance is at an all-time low in this
country. And it’s not like we’re losing them to the Protestants or
Baptists - people aren’t practicing at any denomination these days. If
we can sell them some show - let ’em know the Catholic church has some
panache, we can win them back -even get some new ones. Fill them pews,
people - that’s the key. And cross-promoting - like with the cereal
tie-in grabs the little ones as well. Hook ’em while they’re young.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Kind of like the tobacco industry?</p>
<p><strong>glick</strong>: Oh - if only we had their numbers. But we are
aiming for the same demographic, even though mine is the soulsaving biz.
And if I have to play a bit of the devil to bring them closer to the
Lord, then I’ll wear the cloven hooves and carry the pitch fork.</p>
<p><strong>oc bfthany</strong>: We really appreciate you seeing us this
late in the day, your Emminence. My friends and I have been traveling
all night in hopes of getting a chance to talk to you about the Saint
Michael’s Re-Dedication ceremony.</p>
<p><strong>glick</strong>: You’d like to help out in some way?</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: We’d like you to cancel the ceremony and
the re</p>
<p><strong>glick</strong>: I beg your pardon?</p>
<p><strong>oc bethany</strong>: There’s going to be a world of trouble
if tomorrow’s ceremony goes forward as planned.</p>
<p><strong>click</strong>: What is this - a threat? Are you planning
some sort of demonstation? Are you pro-choicers?</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: No, the trouble’s not from us. It’s from
these renegade angels who’ve been stuck on earth since the plagues…</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Uh… these guys who think they’re renegade
angels.</p>
<p><strong>rufl’s</strong>: See padre, it goes down like this - the boys
believe that by passing through the archway they can get to Heaven.
Granted, it’s far-fetched, but the brothers are convinced it’s the
truth.</p>
<p><strong>oc glick</strong>: And you want me to call off the ceremony…
for that?</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Well. they’re very passionate about it.
Dangerously so. They could turn violent if they walk through that arch
and nothing happens.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: These guys could blow, and if they do,
they’re going to take some people with them. Call this thing off.</p>
<p><strong>click</strong>: Who sent you? Someone from the Council of
Churches, right? Somebody’s upset that we’re getting so much publicity-
is that it? Who was it? Rabbi Sloss?</p>
<p><strong>rlfls</strong>: We were sent by Him who is called I Am.</p>
<p><strong>glick</strong>: Cute. Time to go. kids. Play time with the
Cardinal is over.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Worked for Moses.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Stay out of this. Your Emminence, it’s not
a joke. These guys are an accident waiting to happen. And if the
re-edication ceremony goes on as planned…</p>
<p><strong>glick</strong>: …then these loonies will show up and go nuts,
thus endangering the lives of all assembled, including the Governor, the
press, me, the leaders of the Council of Churches. Heck, let’s not stop
there, maybe even God Himself.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: You can’t say Himself; it could be a
woman.</p>
<p><strong>glick</strong>: Your passion for all topics insignificant,
including the gender of our almighty lord, tests my patience, people.
Now I’m a very important man with very important matters that demand my
attention, so if you’ll please…</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: I’m telling you man. this ceremony is a
mistake.</p>
<p><strong>glick</strong>: The Catholic Church does not make
mistakes.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: What about the church’s silent consent to the
slave trade?</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: And it’s platform of non-involvement during
the Holocaust?</p>
<p><strong>click</strong>: Alright, those were mistakes. But one can
hardly hold the current incarnation of Holy Mother Church responsible
for oversights of old. Now I’ve indulged you for more time than I should
have. Please go.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: But tomorrow…</p>
<p><strong>click</strong>: Tomorrow goes off without a hitch! Do I make
myself clear?! I did not labor two years and exhaust eve~ ounce of my
being to insure that this ceremony be a cornerstone in the most
important liturgical event since Vatican Two just to cancel it at the
zero hour at the insistence of a wandering band of pranksters who’ve
targeted me as the focus of their evening’s merriment! This occasion is
important for the congregation of this parish, for the massive crowds
coming for the plenary indulgence, for me, for his Holiness the Pope,
and - most importantly - for the ‘Catholicism - Wow!’ campaign! And
neither you, nor any other influence short of the hand of God… … HIM
-self will prevent it from occurring successfully!</p>
<p><strong>and takeoff my goddamn hat!!!</strong>: ]ay slowly looks over
the partition.</p>
<p><strong>ext seashore</strong>: The sun slowly rises. The day has
arrived.</p>
<p><strong>ext turnpike - early morning</strong>: Amidst very little
traffic, two figures emerge from the shadows on the Pennsylvania side.
Bartleby and Loki step purposefully past the green sign that welcomes
motorists to New Jersey.</p>
<p><strong>int bar - dawn</strong>: The place is empty, except for
Bethany, Rufus, Jay and Silent Bob and A</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: I can almost see the headlines - if there
were going to be any - “Existence Erased - Thanks to some prick in a
scarlet cape.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: It’s a crime that a guy like him even gets to
wear a scarlet cape.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: That ain’t no crime. You wanna see a crime?
Look what we stole from the guy in the dress. Hand it over.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Oh my God. We’re going straight to Hell, I
know it.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: You stole the Cardinal’s driver?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: I told him to. You know how much these things
are worth? That’s at least a couple of sodas and a pack of smokes right
there.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: What do we do now?</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Let them keep it. In a couple of hours, it
won’t matter anyway.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Not that - about Bartleby and Loki!</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: We have no choice but to try to kill
them.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: But you said they couldn’t be killed.</p>
<p><strong>oc voice</strong>: Correction : they won’t be killed.</p>
<p><strong>azrael</strong>: And just to insure that, we’re all going to
sit tight, right here, until the two idiots pass through that arch.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Hey…!</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: He wasn’t talking about you two.</p>
<p><strong>oc voice</strong>: There’s only one idiot here, .Azrael…</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: And that’s you.</p>
<p><strong>azrael</strong>: The Muse. Just in time to join us for a
drink.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Hey. Where’d you come from?</p>
<p><strong>azrael</strong>: Nothingness. And that’s where I’m returning
to in approximately… …onehour.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Alright Plato - sounds like you’ve had
enough drinks already. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>azrael</strong>: Come on Barkeep - just one drink for the
road. Then I’m gone.</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: I was trying to find you - to tell you
I’d figured out who was behind all this.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Is that who I think it is?</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: None other than.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: That’s my worst suspicions
confirmed.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Alright - one drink. Then you’re
gone.</p>
<p><strong>azrael</strong>: Gimme a Holy Bartender.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Never heard of it.</p>
<p><strong>azrael</strong>: He doesn’t know how to make a Holy
Bartender.</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: Azrael… don’t.</p>
<p><strong>azrael</strong>: Anybody? Well - I know how to make a Holy
Bartender.</p>
<p><strong>azrael</strong>: Get it?</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: Sweet Jesus, Azrael - why?!?</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: C’mon, demon - let’s see you try that shit on
a brother whose already dead!</p>
<p><strong>azrael</strong>: You maintain that kind of an attitude and
you and the barkeep won’t be the only corpses in the room -the
Christ-Bitch will join you.</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: I can’t believe you’re behind this. Are
you really that stupid?! Do you know what’s going to happen if those two
jerks enter that church?!</p>
<p><strong>azrael</strong>: I’m actually counting on it. And if my
calculations are correct, the pawns are moving in to check-mate as we
speak.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: I get it! Holy Bartender! That’s a good
one!</p>
<p><strong>ext saint michael’s church - morning</strong>: A formidable
crowd of parishoners surrounds a small stage, ten yards from the front
of the church. Banners hang every~ere, heralding ‘Catholicism - Wow!’ as
well as the Centennial of Saint Michael’s. The media eats it up.</p>
<p><strong>glick</strong>: I’d also like to acknowledge this great
state’s Governor, Elizabeth Dalton, for coming out an helping us ring in
the first hundred years of this little parish True. she’s a Protestant -
but we won’t hold that against her. Now, let me just give you a bit of
history on this particular little hundred years young House of God…</p>
<p><strong>oc bartleby</strong>: This is no longer God’s House. God
doesn’t live here anymore.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: He’s grown weary of your superficial faith
and has turned a deaf ear to your lip-service prayers. He is no longer
amused, and has abandonned you - His favorites - to the whim of
judgement. Hypocrites and charlatans - prepare to taste God’s wrath!</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Maybe we should just go.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: You wanted your body count, you got it.
This lot is rife with sin. We’ll judge them all!</p>
<p><strong>click</strong>: These are the two I was warned about, Officer
McChee. Please assist them off the church grounds.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Alright mouthpiece, let’s leave the nice
Cardinal alone and go for a ride…</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: Mister McGhee, don’t make me angry. You
wouldn’t like me when I’m angry.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Is that so? Well, let’s just…</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: Ladies and Gentlemen - you have been
judged as guilty of violations against our Almighty Lord. And this very
day - I assure you - you will all pay for your tresspasses… in blood.
Wings. Now.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: I’m not so sure…</p>
<p><strong>int bar - later</strong>: Azrael still hosts his captive
audience, uzi trained on the mortals. The Stygian Triplets surround
them, brandishing their sticks.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: You’re a muse too?</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: Former muse. He was kicked out.</p>
<p><strong>azrael</strong>: Tell them, Serendipity. Tell them how I was
slighted by the Almighty.</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: You got what you deserved, you yellow
shithead.</p>
<p><strong>azrael</strong>: Ever the apple polisher. I’d hoped that when
you left Paradise, you did it finally because you couldn’t tolerate the
injustice that was visited upon your own brother.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: He’s your brother?!</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: Not technically. We were created at the
same time.</p>
<p><strong>azrael</strong>: To compliment one another. Two spirits of
pure inspiration.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: So what happened?</p>
<p><strong>azrael</strong>: Yes. What. Lucifer got restless and started
his little war for the throne. Heaven became divided into two factions -
the faithful and the renegades. The ethereal planes were chaotic with
battle, angel against angel. And when it was all over, Cod cast the
rebels into perdition.</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: But Azrael refused to fight. He
wouldn’t ally himself to God or Lucifer. He remained in the middle,
waiting to see who came out victorious.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: What are you - some kind of fucking
chicken?!</p>
<p><strong>azrael</strong>: I was an artist! I was inspiration! A muse
has no place in battle! Our job is to create - not destroy!</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: So after the fallen were banished to
Hell, God turned on those that wouldn’t fight, and my brother here was
sent down with the demons. Something he considers a grave injustice.</p>
<p><strong>azrael</strong>: Don’t tell me that you never questioned the
judgement, Serendipity; that you don’t think the Almighty acted too
rashly?</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: You’ve been waiting for millions of
years to ask me that, haven’t you? It’s been on your mind since the
moment you fell. It’s been gnawing at you this long.</p>
<p><strong>azrael</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: No, Azrael. It never bothered me, and
I’ll tell you why:</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: So all this is about revenge?! You’re going
to unmake existence because you have a grudge against God?!</p>
<p><strong>azrael</strong>: After the first million years, revenge was
the farthest thing from my mind. Self-preservation became the only
necessity.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Meaning?</p>
<p><strong>azrael</strong>: Escape. Escape from Hell became my
all-consuming reason. So I studied the religions and waited for my
opportunity to present itself; which flnallv did. in the form of the
plenary indulgence And while I couldn’t exercise it myself. I knew the
perfect vessels through which I could free myself from torment.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Bartleby and Loki.</p>
<p><strong>azrael</strong>: After that, it was a simple matter or
waiting for a church to celebrate their Centennial, and when that
finally happened, applying some of the old inspiration tactics - bv
sending the pair an article laced with ideas. An incantation I picked up
in the Pit kept them cloaked and off Heaven’s radars, and aside from the
Triplets and the Gologothan, no soul in Hell had a clue as to what was
going on. Won’t proud Lucifer weep when he realizes I triumphed over the
Power in a way he never dared or dreamed. But no plan, no matter how
intricate, could succeed if the Almighty was in the realm of the quick.
So I dispatched Him in a fairly ingenious fashion.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: How so?</p>
<p><strong>azrael</strong>: Oh no. I’ve seen way to many Bond movies to
know that you never reveal all the details of your plan - no matter how
close you may think you are to success. Suffice it to say, the Catholics
have been even more helpful in insuring my success than by just
supplying the clean-slate archwav. The only X-Factor was the involvement
of the Last Scion. I’m amazed that someone up there would have the balls
to make a move without the Lord’s say-so. Believe me - I sweated when
you stumbled upon my boys on that train. But alas, here you are -
powerless to stop the inevitable.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Look, asshole - I don’t know if anyone
explained the rules to you, but if you succeed, everything gets blinked
out of existence - even you.</p>
<p><strong>azrael</strong>: Human, have you ever been to Hell? I think
not. Do you know that once Hell was nothing more than the absence of
Cod? And if you’d ever been in His presence. then you’d realize that’s
punishment enough. But then your kind came along - and made it so much
worse.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Humans aren’t capable of one hundredth the
evil a shitbag demon like yourself is.</p>
<p><strong>azrael</strong>: Evil is an abstract; it’s a human construct.
But true to his irresponsible nature. man won t own up to being the
engineer of evil, so he blames his dark deeds on my ilk. But his
selfishness is limitless, and it’s not enough for him to shadow his own
existence. He turned Hell into a suffering Pitt - fire, wailing,
darkness - the kind of place anyone would do anything to get out of. And
why? Because he lacks the ability to forgive himself. It is beyond your
abilities to simply make recompense for and regret the sins you commit.
No - you choose rather to create a psychodrama and dwell in a foundless
belief that God could never forgive your ‘grievous offenses’. So you
bring your guilt and inner-decay with you to Hell - where the horrid
imaginations of so many gluttons-for-punishment give birth to the
sickness that has infected the abyss since the first one of your kind
arrived there, begging to be ‘punished’. And in doing so, they’ve
transformed the cold and solitude to pain and misery. I’ve spent eons
privy to the flames, inhaling the decay, hearing the wail of the damned.
I know what effect such horrors have on the delicate psyche of an
angelic beihg. Would you like to glimpse pain eternal? Look…</p>
<p><strong>azrael</strong>: I’d rather not exist than go back to that.
And if everyone has to go down with me, so be it.</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: You’re still thinking only about
yourself, you fuckmg child.</p>
<p><strong>azrael</strong>: Now, now, now. Things are getting too tense
in here. What say we watch a little t.v.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Put on channel nine - ‘Davey and Goliath’!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>azrael</strong>: I was thinking more along the lines of
current events.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: …I repeat - men with huge fucking wings
have laid waste to St. Michael’s… Bullets don’t seem to affect them…
police who were on the scene are dead… The remaining crowd has dropped
to their knees, identifying this as the fabled Apocalypse.. I’m not a
man of faith, but I’m inclined to agree with them..</p>
<p><strong>no! don’t come any closer!!</strong>: PLEASE!! Please…</p>
<p><strong>azrael</strong>: You see that? And I told them to keep a low
profile. I’d be pissed, but in a couple of minutes, it won’t matter
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>azrael</strong>: Now what was that all about?</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: Hunhh? Oh. nothing. I had something in
my eye.</p>
<p><strong>azrael</strong>: Bullshit. What are you trying to do,
Serendipity -get the guy killed? Now who’s the fucking child? What did
you tell him - to hit me with the golf club? Are you serious? I’m a
fucking demon, and you’d have him assault me with athletic equipment?
Well, here then - take it. Call it a gift. Take a shot - take your best
shot. C’mon - c’mon, bright boy.</p>
<p><strong>azrael</strong>: Don’t you know anything?</p>
<p><strong>do it!</strong>: Bethany leaps over the bar, pushing over the
dead bartender, and blesses the melting-ice filled sink. Serendipity
urges Rufus and Jay to follow her, with the Triplets in hand. They
submerge them - head first - in the sink. Cruddy steam and muck blows
out of the water. The Triplets convulse and fall still.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: What the fuck have you been eating?</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: What just happened?</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: He said it himself - he’s a demon. You
hit a demon with an instrument of God - the pure side’s always going to
do the most damage.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Silent Bob’s an instrument of God?!</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: No - but the driver is.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: And Glick’s the kind of asshole that would
bless his own clubs for a better game. And the sink…?</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: You’ve got that Divine heritage going
for you - sanctifing is just one of the fringe benefits.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Remind me to try the water-to-wine thing at
my next party. How far away is this church?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Three towns over - about five miles.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: We’ve gotta make tracks, people - there
isn’t much time left. Rufus, grab his gun.</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Ten steps ahead of you.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: We can take the bartender’s car - I don’t
think he’ll be needing it anymore.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: We gonna make it?</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: Was Jesus down?</p>
<p><strong>ext street - day</strong>: Cardinal Click runs to a pay
phone. Sweating and bloody, he looks a mess. He presses ‘0’ and looks
around wildly - particularly skyward.</p>
<p><strong>glick</strong>: Look, if you didn’t like the cereal thing, we
could’ve gone in a different direction!</p>
<p><strong>getting killed by…!</strong>: As he speaks, a large shadow
falls over him from above. It grows larger, enveloping Click. He drops
the receiver, drops to his knees, and screams.</p>
<p><strong>ext saint michael’s - day</strong>: Bethany, Jay,
Serendipity, Silent Bob, and Rufus stare OC, horrified.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Holy shit.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: See? And people wonder why I don’t go to
church.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Are we too late?</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: To save these poor schmucks, yes. But
we still exist.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Where are they?</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: They could already be in the church.</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: Which means that if they come out,
nobody touches them.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Are you shitting me? The brother here is going
to shred them with his Schwarzenneger special - ain’t you, homey?</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: If they’ve passed through that arch,
they come out clean. And if they die, they go straight up - and we know
what happens then.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: What if they just kill themselves?</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: They can’t - it’s a mortal sin. You die
with a mortal sin on your soul and you burn. They’d go to hell, and
that’s not what they’re after.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: So then what the fuck are we supposed to do?!
Just wait for a solution to fall out of the sky?!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Friend of your’s?</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: ’fraid not.</p>
<p><strong>oc voice</strong>: It was a Cardinal.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: Kind of hard to tell with his face like that,
but the Rosaries are a dead giveaway.</p>
<p><strong>no…!</strong>: She slaps the Uzi out of Jay’s grip. It
clatters to the side.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Don’t you listen?! We can’t touch them!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: I wasn’t gonna touch him, I was gonna shoot
him!</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: He’s been at it for awhile now.</p>
<p><strong>oc loki</strong>: We ran out of parishoners, so he just
started picking up anyone off the street. You’re looking at eons of
repression getting purged. If only we’d been able to jerk off.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: I’d step back if I were you.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: I thought we weren’t supposed to touch
them?</p>
<p><strong>rufus</strong>: I think our Bethan’s about hit her
ceiling.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: This wasn’t my idea. alright? I just wanted to
go home. We both wanted to go home. But he snapped. When he realized who
you were and what you’d have to do, he just lost it. You know what’s
funny about it? He never could stand to see me work. He said he always
felt son~’ for you people - that you didn’t know any better. Now look at
him.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: This guy’s drunker than hell.</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: Which means he’s human now - his wings
have been cut off. Loki! Loki!</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: The Muse. Haven’t seen you in a long time.
What’s with the tits?</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: Loki - have you walked through the arch
yet? C’mon. tell me! Have you gone in and come out through the archway
yet?!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: We were awaiting your arrival.</p>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong>: Bartleby - listen to me! You can’t go
through with this! Azrael was just using you! If you go back this
way…</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: I’ve become aware of the reprocussions,
Muse. I know what I’m doing.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: YOU FUCK! YOU SICK, TWISTED FUCK!! LOOK
WHAT YOU’VE DONE!! LOOK AT All you’ve</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: Bethany - you of all people should
understand what I’m t~’ing to accomplish here. You too have been
abandonned. You know what it’s like to be cast aside. But while you’ve
only felt the devastating effects for a few years, I’ve dealt with it
for millenia. And while you never see your ex-husband or how blissful he
is with his new wife… And he is… ..seeing you people everywhere.
everyday, trapped on this perfect little world He created for you… it’s
a constant reminder that though my kind came first, your kind was most
revered. And your kind knows forgiveness, while my kind knows regret. A
lesson must be taught. All are accountable… even God. Soon a cadre of
police will arrive, just in time to kill us as we exit the church. And
then this failed experiment called existence will cease to be.</p>
<p><strong>loki</strong>: I can’t… let you do this, Bartleby… I didn’t
know we… would end existence…</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: My compatriot. Genocide takes a lot out of
him. He’s weakened. And more importantly. he’s now a human being. A
condition that carries two liabilities: a conscience…</p>
<p><strong>bartleby</strong>: ..and a short life span. Sorry, old friend
- but you lost the faith.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: He’s lost it! We’re fucked! We’re
absolutely fucked!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: I hear you.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: I can’t believe this shit! We’re on the
brink of nonexistence and God’s still nowhere to be found! What the fuck
kind of deity gets kidnapped?!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Amen to that.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: What the hell are you doing?!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: I’d say we’ve got about five minutes left to
live; the whole world’s going to end. You said you’d fuck me.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Are you a complete lunatic?! Everyone’s out
there battling that thing and you want to cower back here and jump my
bones?! We have to go down fighting!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: No - no time for that foreplay stuff, just
sex.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: You pig…!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: What?! It’s all over; nobody’s gonna beat that
thing! Now we can either lay here all comatose like that</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: What did you say?!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: ‘Make with the love’? I just said that to be
sensitive. Usually I call it boning.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: No - about John Doe Jersey?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: That guy - the one that they won’t take off
life support - John Doe Jersey. This is where he’s at.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: What? Where?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Saint Michael’s hospital - over there. There,
across the street, sits a HOSPITAL.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: Where’s the nearest boardwalk?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Look, I ain’t got time to win you a prize or
something, we gotta get to it before…</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Asbury Park. About five miles away.</p>
<p><strong>bethany</strong>: You ever been there?!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Once. I was banging this girl who worked at the
carousel. She wanted to do it on the ride, but I got sick and started
puking…</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: …yes.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Now that’s more like it.</p>
