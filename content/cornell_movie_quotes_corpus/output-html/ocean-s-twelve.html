<p><strong>customer</strong>: Wow. How do they do that?</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: It’s an accident. It means the flower
developed a virus early in the bulb stage. The flaws create the unusual
coloring.</p>
<p><strong>customer</strong>: Can you arrange something for me with
those?</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: Of course. What kind of price range are you
looking for?</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Well, it’s for my parent’s anniversary. They
don’t know I’m coming. I just want it to be beautiful. Can you just do
whatever you think looks best?</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: I’ll need a few minutes.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Take your time, please. And thank you.</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: That should be some surprise.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Which?</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: For your parents.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Oh. Yes. I hope so.</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: Which one is it?</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: I’m sorry?</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: Anniversary.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Oh. Fortieth</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: Wow. Okay. I think I have an idea. Something
classic.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Do you have a bathroom?</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: Straight back, on the left. It’s unisex.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: It’s unisex!</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Miguel Diaz speaking.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: The Baldwins.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: What about them?</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: We had dinner with them three years ago.
You talked about your parent’s anniversary.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: So am I.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Well, I hope Danny is as good as he thinks
he is. A bouquet toss in prison can get pretty ugly.</p>
<p><strong>reuben</strong>: I really think you’re being too sensitive.
She’s crazy about you. I can tell.</p>
<p><strong>reuben</strong>: Joyce, she’s ninety-two. I’m all she has
left. The wheelchair thing was an accident, she’s having some trouble
with the joystick. I’ll adjust it. I told you, when her mouth hangs open
like that, that means she’s happy. I am. When are you coming over?</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: The opening doesn’t work.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Duh.</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: She shouldn’t have the same dream as Franklin.
He’s the antagonist.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: It was your idea.</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: No it wasn’t.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Well, it wasn’t mine. It couldn’t be; it’s
too stupid.</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: Why do you do that? why do you have to get
personal?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: It’s not personal, it’s a fact.</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: It’s personal. You don’t argue logically. You
attack. Bring the right foot back even with the left, buttocks raised
high…. …you have to have reasons, to support your argument… …flattening
the back so the body forms a triangle.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: I can’t listen to you anymore. It makes me
physically sick.</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: Relax the crown of the head toward the floor.
Draw the hips away from the hands, len–gthening the spine. And press the
heels toward the floor.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: This a serious class. No pigs allowed.
Okay?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: Virge.</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: You’re hallucinating.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Yeah, whatever, OJ.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: You are kidding me.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: 736.18 degrees Fahrenheit, Felix. I watched
it.</p>
<p><strong>felix</strong>: Rusty. What do you want from me?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: I want what I paid for.</p>
<p><strong>felix</strong>: And that’s what I sent.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: No, Felix, no. I paid for pure. And if my
workshop were on top of Mount Everest it would be pure. But I’m at sea
level, Felix, and at sea level it should liquefy at 736.95. If it’s
pure, that is. Which this isn’t.</p>
<p><strong>felix</strong>: Well, I didn’t know you were going to liquefy
it.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Let me ask you something: When Christo calls
his cotton supplier and asks for 100% cotton cloth, do you think his
supplier sends him 98% cotton and 2% polyester and when that doesn’t
work, says to Christo, “Well, you should have told me you were going to
wrap the coast of Australia”?</p>
<p><strong>felix</strong>: Who’s Christo?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Felix, you’re in a shame spiral. Have your
assistant lose my number.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Four weeks.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: We stole that money fair and square. You
bought people off to find me. You took advantage during an economic
downturn, and made them say some shit they shouldn’t have said. It’s not
fair, it’s not just, and it aint’ cool.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: I heard what you said, Frank. Did you hear
what I said?</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: How many people here tonight were stupid
enough to have children?</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: What can I say? You’re a funny guy.</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: What it is about horses? I ask you. Is it the
strength? The beauty? The fearlessness? The grace? Of course. But
there’s something else. Something in the eyes.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Excuse me, Mr. Bloom?</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: There appears to be a problem with your
card.</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: You take Visa?</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: I was acting on instructions from your
business manager.</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: My business manager?</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Mr. Benedict.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Look at it this way…Eugene….if the album
goes platinum it’ll cover what you owe. And if the second one goes gold,
that should cover the interest.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: I’m responsible for myself. I have my own
life and my own plans. I’ve never asked for anything but a fair shake.
We make a deal, I stick to the deal.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: How many can’t make the deadline?</p>
<p><strong>reuben</strong>: So I’m smarter than those schmucks on Wall
Street. Whose fault is that?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: How many think if they run, they’ll be
found?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: We’re on the five o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Amsterdam.</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: Flight 144 to Amsterdam.</p>
<p><strong>klm agent</strong>: You’re in seat 43J. Enjoy your
flight.</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: Uh…there must be some mistake. I
mean…unless…is your first class section in the back of the plane?</p>
<p><strong>klm agent</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: Fifty-five K? There’s a fifty-five</p>
<p><strong>klm agent</strong>: We’ve increased capacity by employing
advanced design technology.</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: You made the seats smaller. Can you just say
that? You made the seats smaller.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: See, you’re not hearing me. What I’m trying
to tell you is the reservations agent made a mistake when she issued the
ticket, because on the rare occasions that I fly commercially, I always
book a first- class ticket with no restrictions–</p>
<p><strong>klm agent</strong>: She may have, air, but this is the only
ticket available to you on this flight. I need you to step aside so I
can take care of the next customer.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Now, listen: Don’t make me get black.</p>
<p><strong>reverse angle</strong>: the rest of the group stands sipping
iced lattes from Starbucks and watching the show. Reuben walks up.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Reuben.</p>
<p><strong>reuben</strong>: I wanted to wish you luck. And listen: I
want to do something for you.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>reuben</strong>: Take it. Take it. This is the least I can
do. I’ve got a friend who owns the Bellagio of Amsterdam and I’ve made
reservations for all of you there. It’s all taken care of.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: That’s very touching, Reuben.</p>
<p><strong>reuben</strong>: It’s the least I could do. I love you guys.
Enjoy.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Nice.</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: Great anticipation.</p>
<p><strong>flight attendant</strong>: Gentlemen, you’ll have to go back
to your seats now.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: Ground level. First floor. Day one. Planning
stages. Planning stages.</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: How’d he get that seat?</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: What seat?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Call me an elitist asshole, call me a
bourgeois clown, call me anything you want, but ‘economy’ is
bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Oh, I don’t know…it’s not that ba-</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: Hey. You guys have a minute?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Sure, Linus.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: What’s on your mind?</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: Well, I know this may not be the exact right
time to bring this up, but I’ve been thinking about…well, about where I
want to be in five years, career-wise, and I’ve decided I really want to
be more than just a role-player. I really see myself as kind of an idea
man, like you guys. I mean, I know you do your part and you’re in the
trenches with us and all, but it’s really your show, and like I said,
five years from now, I want to be running my own show….</p>
<p><strong>danny rusty</strong>: Uh-huh. Right.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: So if there’s any opportunity for me to be
involved in the, you know, planning stages of things, I would really
appreciate it. I really feel like I’m ready for more responsibility and
that I could really make a contribution.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Are you thinking what I’m thinking?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Evelyn.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: We’re negotiating the terms with her
tomorrow. You feel up to taking the lead?</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: Are you serious?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: This isn’t some gag?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: No gag.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: Wow. Yeah. That would be awesome.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Okay, then.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: Man. I wasn’t sure if I should say anything.
Now I’m glad I did.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: So are we.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: We’re here to listen.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: Great. Thanks. Really. You won’t regret
this.</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: Tom.</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: He can be a Tom?</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: Anybody can be a Tom.</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: You gotta make your own opportunities. This
ain’t a rehearsal.</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: Tom.</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: Boy, you’re tough.</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: Stop calling me “boy”.</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: How could he lie to us like that?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: The sign said ‘the Bellagio of
Amsterdam’.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: Wait a minute. That’s it?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: Look, you guys no frills, no perks,
run-and-gun, all that stuff, and I said no problem because I believed
you were right that we shouldn’t go deeper into debt and spend money we
don’t have. I mean, am I the only one who thinks this might actually be
a good thing? That we could use a little humility? That maybe we were a
little too pleased and impressed with ourselves after the Benedict job?
Okay, I grant you that maybe this isn’t what we deserve, but maybe it’s
what we need. We can do this. No, I take it back: We have to do
this.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: What are you doing in Amsterdam?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Only what I have to do to get Benedict off
our backs.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Be careful, Danny. Please.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: How’s work?</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: It’s the same. I’m distracted.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: It’s not your fault.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I keep trying to figure out what I did wrong.
How did he find us?</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Danny, don’t keep thinking about it.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I did something wrong. He should never have
found us.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: I’ll call you tomorrow. I love you.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: She’ll try and use her looks to distract you.
Don’t let her.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Be polite, but firm.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Don’t get soft on us. Don’t make too many
concessions.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: I won’t.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: The onset of summer is like a woman who owns
too many shoes.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: If animals were capable of flattery, the
World Bank would be open until 8pm.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: When I was four years old, I saw my mother
kill a spider with a tea cozy.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: A doctor who specializes in skin diseases
will dream that he has fallen asleep in front of the television. Later
he will wake up in front of the television but not remember his
dream.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: O let the sun beat down upon my face, stars
to fill my dreams. I am a traveler of both time and space, to be where I
have been.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Your young friend has a great deal to learn
about respect.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Linus…why don’t you wait outside.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Is that your idea of making a
contribution?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Her terms were scandalous. And we were lucky
to get them after what you said.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: The deal was this close to being blown.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: “Deal?” What “deal?”</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: “Playing along!”</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You called her mother a whore.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: A really cheap one.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: Guys, I’m not falling for this. I’m not….</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: It’s a privately owned home. But don’t let
that fool you. It’s extremely well-protected.</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: What are we after?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: A document. A very old, very valuable
document.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: A stock certificate.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: The first one ever issued, from the first
corporation on the planet. The Dutch East India Trading Company. It’s
the only one of it’s kind and it’s worth a boat-load.</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: What’s our cut?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: 2.7 million after expenses.</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: Each?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Who negotiated this?</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: What do we know so far?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: There’s a dummy key pad by the front door.
But the alarm is really controlled by the keypad in Mr. Vanderspeigle’s
second floor office. Now, here’s good news: we already know the system’s
master code. Evelyn gave it to us.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: That’s not good news, that’s really good
news.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: We just wait until he leaves.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yeah, well…that’s the bad news.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: He doesn’t.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: He’s agoraphobic.</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: So he’s never been out of his house?
Ever?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Not once since he moved in ten years ago.</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: Doesn’t this guy believe in fresh air?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Cracks his windows at night…that’s about
it.</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: Can we tap into the system from the
outside through the phone lines?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Negative. It’s a closed-loop system with two
redundant servers locked into titanium cases in the guy’s bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: Could we use a remote device to trigger the
panel?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: It’s hard-wired and shielded.</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: Guys, am I missing something here? We know his
damn code, right? You’re telling me with that much information we can’t
find a way into this freak’s house?</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: Can’t we just get a telephone repair
truck…</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: …put the basket up and use a telescoping rod
through the open window to tap out the guy’s code?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: The street in front of the house is blocked
off to vehicles.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: And it’s covered by five independently-wired
surveillance cameras….</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Monitored 24-hours a day by a security
company.</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: God, this guy really is a freak.</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: Crazy freak.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Something wrong?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Just…don’t call the guy a freak, okay?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: Okay, here’s something…I’ve got an
idea…suppose we–</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: Well, but how–</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: There’s a Goldmann Grid over the enitre
surface.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: But….</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: –Well, that’s different. Especially if
we–</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: A Schuman Special. Livingston–</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: Absolutely. I mean, I’d need a day
to–</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: You’ll have three. Basher?</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: No worries.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Virgil, Turk.</p>
<p><strong>virgil.</strong>: Just gotta get the gear.</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: Sweden.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Yen?</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: I know, I know. I’ll be bored. You’ll be
fine.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Clock’s running.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: What’s a Schuman Special?</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: Your shot has to hit directly above the
keypad.</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: Let me see the specs.</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: How tall is the surface of this roof?</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: About 87 feet.</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: How tall exactly?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: You’re not going to believe this.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Try me.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: We don’t have line-of-sight.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: We tried everywhere. Some places we’re only
three or four inches off…but…there’s no straight shot. Even with Basher.
It’s literally impossible.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: Can I talk to you guys for a second?</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: Listen, I’ve done a little research on the
Schuman Special, and uh…we don’t have line of sight for the shot.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Jesus. This’ll kill us.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Listen: Don’t say anything. If you’re ever
going to run your own crew, you’ve got to remember to never show
weakness.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: It’s like blood in the water for these
guys.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: If they think you’re slipping, you won’t even
see it coming.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: But hey–thanks.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: I need some air.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: The Swinging Priest?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Not enough time.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Crazy Larry.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Too many variables.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Robinov’s Revenge?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Too many obstacles.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: The Soft Shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Not enough people.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Baker’s Dozen.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: We’d need a woman.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Hell in a Handbasket.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Can’t train the cat that quickly.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I can’t have my wife watch me hauled off in
handcuffs again.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: It’s always about you, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: This like running toward a cliff. Speaking of
which, how’s Isabel?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: I have no idea what you’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You get the tattoo removed?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Given its location, my doctor advised against
it.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: We’re here.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Nice.</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: You want to do what?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Tilt it. Raise it slightly.</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: The whole house?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: It’s only a few inches.</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: Then I’ll have line-of-sight.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: We can’t tilt a whole house.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: They did it with the Leaning Tower of
Pisa.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: It took three hundred guys two years to do
that. You’re crazy. Nobody’s ever done anything like this.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Not true. Palowski did it in
<code>64 in Venice and</code>73 in Istanbul.</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: And he only had a crew of six.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: There are thirty pylons. We cut them, insert
the jacks, and crank.</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: For nineteen hours. Here’s the order in
which they have to be done.</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: So, Basher approached me about being on
a crew.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: Yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: The good news is, after the first twelve
hours, I stopped being able to smell anything.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Took a few more for me.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: This water was stagnant six hundred years
ago.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: There’s no reason for him not to. He would
go to the cops.</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: Okay, so he goes to the cops.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Then they arrest Dominique.</p>
<p><strong>turk.</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Then we have no story.</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: She steals the money from Mr. Mulroney.</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Why would she?</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: To pay Franklin to keep quiet.</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: That’s good.</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: Counterfeiting? Me? I have to tell you, it’s
not something I condone. It’s cheating.</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: It is cheating.</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: There’s no subtlety to it.</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: It’s kind of embarrassing.</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: No one I know…</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: I can’t imagine anything like that.</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: Not bad.</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: Bolivia.</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: Diego’s people?</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: Well. Congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: I told him about you.</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: I’m too old. That’s dangerous. My stuff is
cheap compared to that. It’s just me and my gal, you know. What you’re
talking about is organized. But thanks, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Jay Leno called.</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: When are you gonna stop with that tired
“white people can’t be funny stuff”? It’s so old, Frank, really. Do you
want some orange juice? I got the good kind.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Augie One, this is Condor.</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: This is Augie One; Go Condor.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: We’re fully cranked here. Let’s go to phase
two.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Bring that orange juice.</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: This is Gatsby. We’re green here.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: Let’s discuss, briefly and to begin, with
the category of “thieves”, as distinguished from the larger category of
what might be termed “hardened” criminals. The highest level, “master
thieves,” if you will, is a very small world. Between six and ten
high-level crews are operating in Europe at any given time. Worldwide,
no more than twenty. The most famous, Gaspar LeMarc, is either dead or
retired, and the expectation is that no one will replace him. The good
news is the trend is toward their extinction.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: For example: Anecdotal evidence suggest
these people are personally insufferable.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: Their egos demand constant praise, and they
embellish their exploits to anyone who will listen. They tell their own
stories endlessly, provided of course, they are talking to a fellow
thief or an intimate.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: Those who interact with them on a personal
level are relegated to positions of total servitude, with no chance for
growth or freedom. Their lives are treated as secondary. Many of them
suffer from depression. It’s a crime for which there is no law, and yet
causes untold damage.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: That’s impossible!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Thanks for coming. We can really use your help
on this one.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: I hope the scene hasn’t been
contaminated.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: No forced entry.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Not that we can find.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: We can’t figure out how they disabled the
alarm. We thought maybe they tried to short it out somehow.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: No, that would have triggered the
system.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: Well, then I don’t know how they got in.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: They had to have known the code.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: We considered that, but the mark swears that
nobody in the world knew the code except him. He programmed the last
seven steps of the system himself. He set it and never left the house
again. When he dies, we’ll probably have to physically cut all the power
lines to the house to get it off line.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: There are other ways to get the code. Closed
loop. Redundant servers. Titanium encasement. Not bad.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: Uh…well, they probably set up in a house
across the canal and watched him type the code in through a pair of
binoculars.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Actually, I don’t know about that.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: That’s why they probably set up over
there–</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: It’s where the crossbow bolt hit.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: A crossbow bolt?</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: Ever heard of Franz Schuman?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: They would have fired from that roof.
Through this open window.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: From that roof, through this window? Nobody
could make a shot like that.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: Not a cop, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What’s that supposed to mean?</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: Sorry. Your friend downstairs put me in a
bad mood.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: He’s an idiot. You shouldn’t let him bother
you.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: Yes. You’re right.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: When did he get up and notice the
certificate was gone?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: The alarm woke him at 4:2O am.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: But the alarm would have been–</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: There was someone else.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Someone else.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: Oh, I wish I could’ve have seen that.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: That must have really been something.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Wait! Wait! Shhhh!</p>
<p><strong>dinner jacket</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yeah. What the hell are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>dinner jacket</strong>: I am getting here first.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: This is our score.</p>
<p><strong>dinner jacket</strong>: I am here before you.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: We let you in the house! Somehow you got in
after we hit the code but before we got to the door.</p>
<p><strong>dinner jacket</strong>: That’s thirty seconds. How could I
know which exact thirty seconds I had? Unless I knew you plan. Could I
have known your plan? Do you have a snitch in your group?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: We don’t.</p>
<p><strong>dinner jacket</strong>: Yes, I know you don’t. Because I saw,
the whole thing from that chair. I knew you were around, but I had my
own plan.</p>
<p><strong>dinner jacket</strong>: There’s really no need for that.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Listen, we have to come to some
arrangement.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: We’ve incurred some very serious costs
here.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: Well, we have.</p>
<p><strong>dinner jacket</strong>: Every second I am becoming more
outnumbered.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Who’s this?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: He said he got here first.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: That’s bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Hey. Mouth.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: This is our goddamned job!</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: If the situation were reversed–</p>
<p><strong>dinner jacket</strong>: But the situation is not reversed.
The situation is that I am here first, without any help from you.</p>
<p><strong>dinner jacket</strong>: So as much as I would–</p>
<p><strong>dinner jacket</strong>: Jesus, how many of you are there?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Just give us the stock certificate. Whatever
else you took out of that safe…it’s yours.</p>
<p><strong>dinner jacket</strong>: No. But: I leave you with
something.</p>
<p><strong>dinner jacket</strong>: My attorney. In case Evelyn’s
employer tries anything…well, anything.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: I’m sure there’s another scenario that would
fit these physical details, but I don’t know what it is.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Where should we start?</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: You can start by picking that guy up.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Who the hell was that guy?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It’s going to get out, you know. People are
going to find out.</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: Somebody must know this bloke’s name.</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: The question is who trained him. He got
into that place alone.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: He says.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I believed him.</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: You think he’s better than us?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’m not saying anything, but the man was
sitting there, waiting for us.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: Do you think the cops even know who this guys
is?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Please. That guy’s never even seen a cop.</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: Maybe he works with the cops.</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: You don’t work with the cops unless you
absolutely have to. And not even then.</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: Either way, he’s got to have a name.</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: It can’t be that hard to find out who
this guy is. Like I said, somebody trained him. Who trains the best?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: LeMarc. Right?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: If he’s not dead.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: Who’s LeMarc?</p>
<p><strong>onderdonk</strong>: Fucking stone.</p>
<p><strong>davenpeck</strong>: I’m not quitting.</p>
<p><strong>onderdonk</strong>: Who said quitting. I’m tired.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: Can I speak to him?</p>
<p><strong>davenpeck</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>davenpeck</strong>: Apparently, you can do whatever you want
with him.</p>
<p><strong>onderdonk</strong>: Are you moving him?</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: Oh no. I just need to speak with him. To get
some information.</p>
<p><strong>davenpeck</strong>: We’ve been on him for six hours.</p>
<p><strong>onderdonk</strong>: With our best stuff.</p>
<p><strong>davenpeck</strong>: Our best stuff. In mind terms, we’ve been
torturing this guy.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: I’m sure. I only need a moment, then I’ll be
out of your way.</p>
<p><strong>through the mirror</strong>: Isabel walks right up to Evelyn,
smiles, and whispers one word to him/her.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: It’s not a problem, it’s a hiccup. It won’t
affect our schedule that much. I want to talk about you, not the job.
How are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Tess, I’ve got to call you back.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Coming.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: Hello, Robert.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Isabel.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: “Robert?” Is that his real name?</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: How does she know that?</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: Ex-girlfriend.</p>
<p><strong>basher &amp; saul</strong>: Fiancee.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: It’s great to see you.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: Is it? Because you’ve been seeing a lot of
me lately.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: You were sitting in a Mercedes outside my
apartment on Wednesday night.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: You were hiding in the bushes when I had
lunch yesterday at Trattoria Bella.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: This one…I’m not even sure where this one
was taken, but I like it a lot. Very Ron Gallela.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: I mean, if I didn’t know better I’d think
you all came here to steal the Vanderspeigle Getuigschrift, also known
as the world’s first stock certificate. You must have been so proud of
yourselves. A Schuman Special. It’s been awhile. That was a very
handsome crossbow shot, Eugene.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: And the Palowski…whose idea was that?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: We didn’t steal anything.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: Oh…I know you didn’t. Somebody beat you to
it. One man. No crew. No back up. Tell me something – just so I can get
the full picture in my head – was he wearing a tuxedo? A white dinner
jacket?</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: At least we saw him in the flesh. You’ll
never see this guy your whole life.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: So you know who he is?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Of course we know who he is.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: Well, then. I’ll see you when you see him.
To get your certificate back.</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: Who’s hat is that?</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: How did she– That was–</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: This is what I was talking about. This is
exactly what I was talking–</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: –I was just checking up on her. I knew she
didn’t want to see me. I was being polite.</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: Where did she learn all that stuff? The
Palowski stuff.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Her father.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: He was a cop?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Thief.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: Was he good?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Very.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: What’s the big deal? She’s just some
brilliant, pissed-off ex- girlfriend who’s dad taught her every trick in
the book.</p>
<p><strong>saul &amp; basher</strong>: Fiancee.</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: But did you see that display of emotion,
handing out those pictures?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Totally unprofessional.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: She’s passionate.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: She’s unbalanced.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Her job is very stressful.</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: She could reduce her stress by leaving us
alone.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: We’ve got to slow her down.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: But first: We find our French friend and
introduce ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>isabel’s boss</strong>: Twenty-four hours. You know that.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: I don’t have twenty-four hours. They’re
there now. They’ll lead me to him.</p>
<p><strong>isabel’s boss</strong>: You also know that you can go now, if
you don’t take your secretary. When there’s liability, I need a
document.</p>
<p><strong>hess</strong>: He said we can’t leave until tomorrow because
of liability issues and he needs a document.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>hess</strong>: Thanks for trying.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: Let’s share a car.</p>
<p><strong>hess</strong>: That would be nice. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: I can’t believe they won’t make an
exception. I’ve got to find out who this other guy is.</p>
<p><strong>another beautiful woman</strong>: Fantastic.</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: He did his first big job in 1989.
Bundesbank, Berlin.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: The fifteen million dollar one the day the
Berlin wall fell?</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: He was nineteen years old.</p>
<p><strong>another beautiful woman</strong>: Where do you want to go
this weekend?</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: Bank Faltier, Paris 190 and again in ’91….
Total take twenty-one million euros. Bank of Italy ’92. Eighteen
million. Danish Treasury, also 192. Twenty-two million.</p>
<p><strong>92 continued: 92</strong>: BASHER</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: Hang on a second! He– All of them?!</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: He’s not done.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Wait – Prado Museum, the Picasso – that was
Moretti.</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: He in Moretti. It’s one of his aliases.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Anything else?</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: UDC bank in Geneva, `94. Nineteen million in
bearer bonds. The Louvre –’95 and twice in ’96.</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: He left a Post-It note on the Mona Lisa that
said “Bitch set me up.”</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: Tell them about Saint Tropez.</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: In 2000, he stole the King of Morocco’s 230
foot yacht. Vanished into thin air. Crew surfaced a few days later in a
life raft. Couldn’t remember a thing.</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: How do you hide a two hundred foot yacht?!</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: If the King knows, he’s not telling. He
received it back a month later.</p>
<p><strong>another beautiful woman</strong>: How far is your house,
Baron?</p>
<p><strong>toulour</strong>: Twenty minutes by helicopter.</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: One guy did all those jobs?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: How’d he get all those aliases?</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: Until a month ago Interpol were convinced
that the heists were the work of twelve different people. But not any
more.</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: The French national police just gave him
a nickname. “Le Renard Nuit” – The Night Fox.</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: Scotland Yard said he’s the new LeMarc.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Scotland Yard never saw LeMarc.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Personal information?</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: Some say he’s one of these guys that thinks
because he was born in a penthouse, he controls the elevator business.
Others say he turned out okay when you consider how rich his parents
were.</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: Taxes over here are brutal. People don’t
realize.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: Father was a big-time industrialist, got into
the cellphone market on the ground floor. Mother inherited. Had maids as
a child. He’s a public figure, people know who he is. He’s been rumored
to run for office in Spain, even though he doesn’t appear to live
there.</p>
<p><strong>another beautiful woman</strong>: What do you have in there,
the Mona Lisa?</p>
<p><strong>toulour</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>another beautiful woman</strong>: You know what? I don’t like
that painting either. I don’t like anything Van Gogh did.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: He’s an avid golfer, pro-level tennis player,
and inveterate gambler. But apparently his favorite pastime is….</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Spit it out, Linus.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: He’s rarely alone. I think it’s a compulsion.
I have a list of names here…it was just the first week.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: All right, moving on, is there anything else
we need to know about this guy before we–</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: Did we forget to mention he’s a
Viscount?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: A what?</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: Viscount. As in nobility.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Last time I checked titles like that went out
with a little number I like to call the French Revolution–</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: Spain.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: His title. It’s Spanish. Mother’s
cousin.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: He may be the greatest thief in Europe. He
may have slept with half of the EU. He may be a Casanova with the soul
of a starving artist. It doesn’t matter.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: There’s something he cares about. There’s
something he can’t live without.</p>
<p><strong>edmunds</strong>: Are you on steroids?</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: Let’s try again. Give me five games this
time.</p>
<p><strong>toulour</strong>: You are worse than Sampras. You should be
paying me.</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: Pardon me, sir.</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: Two gentlemen. They say they met you in
Amsterdam last week.</p>
<p><strong>toulour</strong>: Put them on the veranda and get them a
drink. I’ll be right up.</p>
<p><strong>toulour</strong>: Rusty.</p>
<p><strong>108 continued: 108</strong>: TOULOUR</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Other way around.</p>
<p><strong>toulour</strong>: Are you sure? Usually I’m so good at
that.</p>
<p><strong>toulour</strong>: This is Edmund. Edmund. Rusty. Danny.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Nice to meet you. Edmund. You a tennis
pro?</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: Actually, no, I’m the King of Morocco.</p>
<p><strong>toulour</strong>: Sadly, I can’t show you my favorite
painting of all – a Degas that used to hang right there – because it was
stolen recently.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: That’s awful.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: The criminal element is everywhere these
days.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Listen, Francois–</p>
<p><strong>toulour</strong>: Please. Call me Baron.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: We came here for the Vanderspeigle
certificate–</p>
<p><strong>toulour</strong>: That’s not for sale.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Your Degas is worth three times that. You
want your painting back, you’re going to have to trade.</p>
<p><strong>toulour</strong>: You actually expect me to believe that you
are in possession of my Degas? You are living in a…in a bubble.</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: He used the word “amateur”?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: You said we could show him the painting
right, to prove that we had it.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: He still wouldn’t trade.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: We need to teach him a lesson.</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: All right, let’s stay calm. We don’t need to
over-react here. He said some disrespectful things, that’s true. But why
antagonize this guy? Why get into something with him? He’s young and
he’s filthy rich, and he’s got time on his hands. We don’t want to
become his Betty noir. We can just fence his painting and earn a lot
more than we would have from the certificate.</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: It’s about reputation. You said so yourself.
We have to get that certificate to Evelyn’s buyer or–</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: We’ll make enough selling the Degas to pay
off her buyer–</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Then why did you make that trip down there in
the first place, if you didn’t want to get into something?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Saul?</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: Turn his name over to Isabel. In exchange for
getting off our backs.</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: Short of that…the only appropriate response is
to steal his next job right out from under him. Just like he did to
us.</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: We don’t even know our next job.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: We got ten million in that closet.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I cash in the Degas, take a moment to think
about our next move. Toulour isn’t going anywhere. You guys are hyping
him too much, you’re letting him get inside your head.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: Why do I need to see all these guys? When I
tracked the Munch down in Sweden I got all the approvals I needed with
one phone call.</p>
<p><strong>114 continued: 114</strong>: ISABEL</p>
<p><strong>hess</strong>: Without their signatures, you can’t do
anything. You can’t pull the suspects over, you can’t do surveillance on
them, you’re not even allowed to contact them. They’re real sticklers
about sovereignty issues here.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: Isabel, I couldn’t possibly sign those
documents in good conscience without talking to you about the case in
detail. I realize you’re in a hurry and my schedule for the rest of the
day is quite full, so perhaps, if you’re interested in being expedient,
we could discuss the case…over dinner.</p>
<p><strong>hess</strong>: Foucquet’s at eight-thirty. Apparently their’s
a private room. Better bring your kevlar. Don’t stop for that.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: That’s not how I want to go.</p>
<p><strong>toulour</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>toulour</strong>: Very theatrical of you…asking to meet here.
Like we’re spies meeting to do an exchange.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Why are you doing this to us?</p>
<p><strong>toulour</strong>: Doing what?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: This is a game for you. For us it’s survival.
Are you that bored? I mean…</p>
<p><strong>toulour</strong>: No. I wouldn’t do that. No… The truth is…I
made a bet. Or maybe a better word is a “wager”.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What kind of wager?</p>
<p><strong>toulour</strong>: A gentlemen’s wager with a friend of mine –
my mentor. A few months ago we were at his winter place in Nicaragua and
another guest referred to me as “the greatest thief in the world.” I
didn’t object, obviously, but my mentor fell silent. Later I asked him
about it. He said if I really wanted to say I was the best thief…I’d
have to prove I was better than the eleven of you.</p>
<p><strong>118 continued: 118</strong>: TOULOUR</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: 163.</p>
<p><strong>toulour</strong>: Sorry. 163. Before you were found.</p>
<p><strong>toulour</strong>: Yes, 163 million is a lot of money. It
attracts attention. So, in a way, you brought this problem with me on
yourselves. You’re victims of your own success.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Here’s what I’m going to do. You tell me the
name of your mentor. I’ll call him up and I’ll tell him that you’re the
greatest thief in the world…that I accept that to be true…. And in
return…you leave us alone, let us go about our business. How about
that?</p>
<p><strong>toulour</strong>: He said you’d probably say something like
that – but he said you’d probably have your fingers crossed when you
said it.</p>
<p><strong>toulour</strong>: So in this situation – for the purposes of
my wager – words aren’t good enough. I have to prove this on the
ground.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: This mentor of yours…was he a good thief in
his day?</p>
<p><strong>toulour</strong>: Who, LeMarc?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yeah. Him.</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: I thought so too.</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: LeMarc. The LeMarc.</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: God hates me. He hates all of us.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Hell, this could go on forever.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: No. It’s going to be settled by one more job.
A single object.</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: Whatever it is, let’s just let him have
it.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: We can’t.</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: Because of pride?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Because we beat him, he’ll pay Benedict
off.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Now we’re talking.</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: One score, for the whole thing?</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: What do we have to do? I mean, is it a
fair bet or is it like…the Coronation Egg or something?</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: He wants us to steal the Coronation Egg!</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: That’s just… that’s…what is that?</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: The Holy Grail.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Carl Faberge, the greatest goldsmith in
history, constructed the Coronation Egg in 1896 for the wedding of Czar
Nicholas and Alexandra. Every world class thief in the last 108 years
has tried to steal it. No one has even come close.</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: That’s because it’s cursed.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: It’s un-stealable.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: It’s the only thing in LeMarc’s entire career
that he went after but failed to get. He tried three times.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: We get the egg and we’re free.</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: That’s great, except we can’t get it.</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: It’s not possible.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Then we go to jail.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Well…where is it now?</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: I’m going to need surveillance on both
hotels, phone taps, room bugs, people in the lobby and by every
exit.</p>
<p><strong>carabinieri officer</strong>: Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: If I had to guess I’d say I’ll need at least
25 people, a dozen vehicles…and an on-call air unit.</p>
<p><strong>carabinieri officer</strong>: Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: Okay, one more thing, and this is crucial:
these guys are extremely, sophisticated at avoiding electronic
surveillance, so we’ll need real state of the art stuff.</p>
<p><strong>carabinieri officer</strong>: Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: Okay. Good. Now what time am I meeting
Captain Giordano?</p>
<p><strong>carabinieri officer</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: No, what time?</p>
<p><strong>carabinieri officer</strong>: Yes…absolutely…</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: I see…so…you’ve spoken with the Pope and
he’s okay with autographing my breasts?</p>
<p><strong>carabinieri officer</strong>: Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What am I looking at?</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: A TR354 infra red motion detection
system. It’s the gold standard.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Saul and Linus back yet?</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: And I can’t find Rusty.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Well, I don’t know, but that’s one nasty
lock.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Seen Rusty?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: We thought he was with you.</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: Not since we first got here. About an hour
ago.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: Jesus, Robert. I could’ve killed you.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: I’m older.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: I hope so. What are you doing in my
room?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: I thought maybe we could get some coffee.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: No, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Okay, how about a two week trip to
Zanzibar?</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: Please don’t.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Fine, coffee then. Whatever you say.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: Why do I want to have coffee with you?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: How should I know? sorry about your mom.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: She hated you.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Well, she was nice enough to hide it from me.
Some people can’t even do that.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: She hated everybody.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: You’ll never get it by the way.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Get what?</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: You’ll think you’ve got it, you’ll be so
close that you’ll be able to taste it and then this guy, the Night Fox
or whoever he is, will just take it – right out of your hand – just like
he did in Amsterdam. He’s as good as LeMarc.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: It’s not possible.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: You’re in a bubble.</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: No, that won’t work either. The IR will
pick it up before you even get close.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Look, if we’re having this much trouble, and
we’ve got ten guys Toulour must be pulling his hair out.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Would you call that bubble-shaped?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: She pulled a gun on me.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Are you back on?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: I’m selling. She ain’t buying.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: More importantly, what kind of reception is
the Italian Police giving her?</p>
<p><strong>subordinate officer</strong>: Captain Giordano is handling an
urgent interrogation. He’ll be up as soon as it is completed. Please
wait in here.</p>
<p><strong>captain giordano</strong>: Naples sucks! They’re a joke! The
only decent player they have is Pasqualli – and he’s a pussy.</p>
<p><strong>italian cop 1</strong>: Pasqualli runs circles around
Bologna’s backfield every time.</p>
<p><strong>italian cop 2</strong>: Pasqualli could single-handedly–</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: What are they talking about?</p>
<p><strong>subordinate officer</strong>: It’s an internal matter,
Madame.</p>
<p><strong>italian cop 3</strong>: –and her friends could trounce
NapIes!</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: Damn-it.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: All right, okay. Let’s not be defeatists….
What about that mirror trick that Akimbo tried at the–</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: –There’s no mirror thin enough to avoid
tripping the lasers.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What’s he doing now?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Nothing. Just reading the papers at a cafe.
Oh, no, wait. A woman just sat down next to him…. He’s getting her phone
number.</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: Wow. What are those?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Jimmy Chu.</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: I’ve never seen that color.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Okay, take it easy over there.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: We thought someone was following us.</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: We gave ’em the shake. Caught ’em napping.</p>
<p><strong>subordinate officer</strong>: Captain Giordano, Rome Police
Special Investigations. Isabel Lahiri, Europol, Major Theft Task
Force.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: …reason to believe these men… …are going to
try to steal the Coronation Egg when it is actually put on display next
week. I need official authorization to surveil and pursue these
suspected criminals on Italian soil.</p>
<p><strong>captain giordano</strong>: Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: And I’ll need substantial resources from
your department. Can I count on that?</p>
<p><strong>captain giordano</strong>: Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: So, Captain, what do you think of my
skirt?</p>
<p><strong>captain giordano</strong>: I think it’s very beautiful. Why,
don’t you like it?</p>
<p><strong>toulour</strong>: I don’t usually call for a second date. For
you I make an exception.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>toulour</strong>: I think it’s good that we talk. You see,
you should stop following me. You’re wasting your time. I’m going to let
you go first and get caught. Then they will increase the security even
more, and then I will steal the Egg. Then Lemarc can make his
decision.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You sound confident.</p>
<p><strong>toulour</strong>: Confident? This is a very American word. I
am arrogant. There’s a difference.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Doesn’t matter if you’re that good. Are you
that good?</p>
<p><strong>toulour</strong>: I can move objects with my mind.</p>
<p><strong>toulour</strong>: You don’t believe it?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Do you?</p>
<p><strong>toulour</strong>: Are you done stirring your sugar?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: That’s fantastic. Listen, I appreciate the
call, and, best of luck.</p>
<p><strong>toulour</strong>: Danny. I’m serious. Sit down, please.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You’re telekinetic, is that what you’re
telling me?</p>
<p><strong>toulour</strong>: Yes. But…it’s a curse. A nightmare.
Everything is too easy. But then LeMarc says I’m still not the best. So
I take his challenge. And you will fail, and I will win, and so what?
What does it prove? What is he trying to show me?</p>
<p><strong>captain giordano</strong>: Ms. Lahiri, you’re in Italy now.
We are a sovereign nation. We’re not some adjunct, some administrative
district of the EU. When Europol calls we don’t jump up and tap dance
for you. If you want to work in Italy, then you have to do it under
Italian authority…and that means you have to talk to Commander
Andriotti…who, I’m sure, will be happy to meet with you some time next
week–</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: Next week!</p>
<p><strong>captain giordano</strong>: –when he returns from
vacation.</p>
<p><strong>hess</strong>: He said he has to get approval from someone
else and they’re on sick leave.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: Vacation.</p>
<p><strong>hess</strong>: Sorry I fell asleep.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: We both did. I’m exhausted.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: Hi, this isn’t official business. Actually,
I’m here on vacation. But I was sitting in a cafe this afternoon, near
the Piazza Navona and…the police were chasing someone on foot. I was
just wondering if you caught him or…do you know anything about that
case?</p>
<p><strong>italian detective</strong>: I know the case, yes.
Unfortunately, we didn’t catch him.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: Oh…</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: Excuse me…</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: Um…Did I…? I think I saw you…yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Oh yeah?</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: The police were chasing you.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: You sure your eyes aren’t broken?</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: I’m quite sure it was you.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Well, then I’m not gonna argue. Can I buy you
a coffee?</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: We’ve got to stop meeting like this.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: What are they talking about all the
time?!</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Soccer. He doesn’t like Naples….thinks
they’re a bunch of…sissies. Can I ask you a question? Will you come to
Zanzibar with me on Friday?</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: Stop it.</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: We did it! It works!</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What, what happened?</p>
<p><strong>captain giordano</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: An order signed by Commander Andriotti
instructing you to “provide any and all support that Agent Lahiri
requests, whenever she requests it.”</p>
<p><strong>captain giordano</strong>: It’s good, yes. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>captain giordano</strong>: That’s a very nice blouse you wear
today.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: When Dominique goes back with Thomas to check
the trunk, the money shouldn’t be in the briefcase. Franklin should have
double-crossed them.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: That could be a great moment, when he’s on
the ground.</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: And you think Thomas is going to get blown
up.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: Another camera here and here. And have a
guard here at all times so any attempt to disable the system will be
detected. All your IR devices need to be fitted with reflective faces
otherwise a UV later can be used to burn the sensors out.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: She just walked in there like Patton or
something. She’s changing…everything and– There were so many cops with
her. I’ve never seen so–</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: I don’t understand. If her father was a
thief…why’s she such a hardass? I mean you’d think she’d have a little
sympathy for us.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: When she was twelve her mother told her that
her dad got arrested doing a job in Russia and died in jail. So I
wouldn’t count on much sympathy.</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: “This time it’s personal”.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Ever heard of overkill?</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: I don’t even think Toulour can get it
now.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: If he gets it, we’ll let you arrest us. If we
get it, you come away with me to Zanzibar–</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: What is your obsession with Zanzibar?!</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Do you want to make the bet or not?</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: I’m hanging up. Stop calling me.</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: I’m telling you, with everything she’s
done in the last twenty-four hours…unless you happen to be best friends
with the head of security at the museum, unless you are someone he knows
and trusts enough to leave alone in the gallery, after disabling about
half of their security system, forget it. We are not stealing that
egg…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: “Someone he knows. Someone he trusts….”
“Someone he knows….”</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: What about someone he doesn’t know but
trusts?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: For instance?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: I’m talking about you know who, who looks an
awful lot like you know who…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: She might. It’s not going to be easy getting
her over here.</p>
<p><strong>bruiser</strong>: Hiya, Tess. Just climb on through. Try not
to look down too much.</p>
<p><strong>reuben</strong>: There’s make-up in the bag there. And some
photos. Do the best you can.</p>
<p><strong>hotel manager</strong>: Bonjourno. Yes. Yes. Oh…oh, really.
Well, absolutely. We can have…I can make our presidential suite
available. No, no, no. No trouble at all. We’d love… We’re honored that
she’d think of us…</p>
<p><strong>hotel manager</strong>: Julia Roberts is coming to stay with
us!</p>
<p><strong>press</strong>: Ms. Roberts! Ms. Roberts! Why did you come
back to Rome so soon!!</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: I…uh…</p>
<p><strong>press</strong>: Was it to see Topher?</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: To see what?</p>
<p><strong>press</strong>: Topher Grace!! Your co-star!! Is that why
you’re here?!</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Oh. No. I came to – to see the–</p>
<p><strong>press</strong>: Where’s Danny?</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>press</strong>: Danny, your husband!!</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Well, he’s not really–</p>
<p><strong>reuben</strong>: Ms. Roberts is very tired!! Please let her
through! Please!</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: I can’t do this.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yes, you can.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: I’m not an actress, Danny! And I don’t look
like her!</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You do, Tess. You really do. I never told you
that before, but it’s true.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Come on: my…</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: And my…</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: And my ears. Anybody who sees my ears is going
to know instantly.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Nobody’s looking at your ears.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Yes, Danny, they are. They’re going to
know.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: When did that happen?</p>
<p><strong>museum director</strong>: We just found out. I arranged a
private showing for tomorrow morning before we open the show to the
public.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: I don’t understand, why do you have to
disable any of the systems–</p>
<p><strong>museum director</strong>: Because she might want to get close
to the egg, got right up here and look at it. And I’m not going to
embarrass myself or this institution by telling her she can’t.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: She’s an actress, Giovanni, not the
Pope.</p>
<p><strong>museum director</strong>: Do you realize how much free
publicity we’ll get for this museum, just because she because she
decided to come by and look at the egg? She’s even agreed to do a photo
shoot for us promoting the museum.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: That’s exactly the sort of thing…</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: …that the people I’m after will exploit.
Okay, fine. You want to shut down half the electronic system, let me
post eight cops in the room…</p>
<p><strong>museum director</strong>: Are you crazy? That’s worse
than….you want me to treat her like a criminal?</p>
<p><strong>museum director</strong>: Look, if you need to do something
to reinforce security during her visit, fine. But it’s got to be out of
sight. And it can’t effect Julia in any way. Are we clear?</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: There. I took a look at the interrogation
scene.</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: ’Cause Linus said it was repetitive.</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: It clarifies everything.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: He said it’s too on the nose.</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: What’s he, the head of the studio? What’s he
ever written?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: He’s just saying – Oh, no–</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: It’s not him!</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: What! How did you– You moron! You said you
were watching him the whole time!</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: I was! I mean, I used the bathroom once, but
it was quick. You lost him yesterday!</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: Livingston said Frank said that Rusty said
that Danny said Toulour said don’t ever bother following him.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: I have to go. Right now. I have to leave the
country. It could be a while. A month. Maybe more.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: What are you saying? What the hell are you
saying? Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: I can’t tell you.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: When people start talking the way you’re
talking there are only two possibilities: you’re either in intelligence
or you’re a criminal. And no one I work with has ever worked with you…or
even knows your name.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: You knew what I was the day you met me,
Isabel.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: Robert…</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: We can talk about it when I get back.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: No, Robert. I have to tell you
something.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: I’m taking the job. I’m moving to
Amsterdam.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: I can’t have this conversation right now.
Please, Isabel. I have to get out of here. I love you.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: You want to walk?</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: I know how you’re planning to do it. I know
Julia’s visit is the key.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Who’s Julia?</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: LeMarc knew when to get out. He just
quit…with his perfect record intact. Now he’s a legend. Don’t do
this.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: LeMarc quit because he was 75 years old,
Isabel. He was tired. His doctor told him if he didn’t start taking it
easy he was going to have another heart attack. You’re dramatizing
it.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: You don’t know why LeMarc retired, any
better than I do. You have no idea.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Actually, I do. I know exactly why.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: Really? How’s that?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: He told me.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: You know LeMarc?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: A little.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: Since when?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Ten years ago.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: For how long?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: For six months.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: You–</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: You knew LeMarc? You knew LeMarc and never
told me? That’s the worst thing you’ve ever done to me. Nobody knows
more about LeMarc than me. How could you do that?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: I couldn’t tell you, then.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: Really awful.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: Then why aren’t you as good as Toulour?</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: I don’t want to arrest you, Robert. I really
don’t. But I will if you make me. I will if you go for that egg.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: So many times, I waited. You can’t do that
to a person.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Isabel–</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: I have to go.</p>
<p><strong>reuben</strong>: You’re a photographer. Very exacting. You
want things a certain way, but you never raise your voice. You’re
uncompromising. Strong.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Reuben, what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>reuben</strong>: Oh, we understand each other. I’m mean, the
actual words are gibberish to me, but I know what he means. There’s a
tone, you know. We communicate. I’m sure he’d tell you the same thing.
Am I right?</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: I say we do a Joey Heatherton, 1971.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: It’s the wrong color.</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: Damn.</p>
<p><strong>topher</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>topher</strong>: Hey! I got your room number from McCormick,
I hope you don’t mind.</p>
<p><strong>topher</strong>: This is great. Do you have the adjoining
room?</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Uh, no.</p>
<p><strong>topher</strong>: Oh. Hey. I saw the rough cut of YOU ALWAYS,
YOU NEVER. It’s so awesome. Congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Oh. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>topher</strong>: It was just like a dub of a lo-rez output,
but I could totally see what you were doing. I think you might win
again. Seriously.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>topher</strong>: It really actually looked like you were
blind. How did you do that? What is it like, an on-set thing, or was it
digital?</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: It was, uh…</p>
<p><strong>topher</strong>: You can tell me, I won’t tell a soul.
Because if you say it’s instinctual, I’m quitting right now. Seriously.
The way you parted your hair? That was so connected. And that scene with
the matches? And when you find out who your real grandmother is and run
through the rain and find her on the porch and touch her face? Man, that
was…you gotta tell Steven how much I loved it.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>topher</strong>: So what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: I’m, uh, getting ready to go out…</p>
<p><strong>topher</strong>: I mean next. What movie are you doing
next?</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: I…I’m having trouble deciding what to do
next.</p>
<p><strong>topher</strong>: Is Danny working?</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Danny…Danny is…Danny is…</p>
<p><strong>topher</strong>: Oh, no. Is something wrong? Have you
two…</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: No, no…</p>
<p><strong>topher</strong>: I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: No. we’re absolutely fine, he’s just–</p>
<p><strong>topher</strong>: I’ve got to stop asking people about their
spouses, it’s like always a mistake–</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: No, really–</p>
<p><strong>topher</strong>: Listen, I won’t say a word. Seriously. I’m
rooting for you guys, you know that. This is your private business and I
totally respect that. No more Danny questions from me.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Thank you. He’s fine. Danny’s fine. He’s
working.</p>
<p><strong>topher</strong>: Hey, cool, whatever. That’s what I’ll
say.</p>
<p><strong>topher</strong>: So can I come look at that Egg with you?</p>
<p><strong>reuben</strong>: My name is Stuart Feldman, Worldwide
Executive Senior Vice- President of Marketing, Corporate Senior
Vice-President of Publicity and Corporate International Executive
Worldwide President of Promotion for the Warner Brothers Motion Picture
company. My colleague, Grant Wells, who is responsible for Ms. Roberts
itinerary, has graciously set aside time for Ms. Roberts to view the
Coronation Egg privately.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: I want to be on record as saying that you
should have shut the entire museum down.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: There! Right there!</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: It’s so beautiful. My God.</p>
<p><strong>topher</strong>: Kinda small.</p>
<p><strong>topher</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: I’m not going to set off any alarms?</p>
<p><strong>museum director</strong>: No. No. Get as close as you
like.</p>
<p><strong>reuben</strong>: Julia – unless you have any objections – Wen
and his crew set up for the publicity stills.</p>
<p><strong>reuben</strong>: I was thinking maybe we could get you and
Topher into some “You Always You Never” hats and t-shirts for the
shoot–</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: That’s stupid.</p>
<p><strong>reuben</strong>: So stupid! Idiot. Maybe we could put some
posters in the background–</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: I don’t think we want to be so obvious–</p>
<p><strong>reuben</strong>: I completely agree! Stop trying to turn this
into some sort of stunt.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: This isn’t going to work.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: I don’t know what you’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>julia</strong>: Okay, thanks everybody. Thank you so
much.</p>
<p><strong>topher</strong>: Hey, J Ro, why the quick exit?</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: I…uh, I have to take some pills. Aspirin. I
get headaches.</p>
<p><strong>topher</strong>: Yeah, well, with everything thing you’ve
been going through I can see how you’d need something.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: They’re just aspirin.</p>
<p><strong>topher</strong>: Right. I’ve never taken aspirin in my life,
ever. Can you believe that?</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: That’s amazing.</p>
<p><strong>topher</strong>: For me, it’s like a control thing.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Well, with aspirin…it’s very beneficial.</p>
<p><strong>topher</strong>: Oh, yeah. I’m sure.</p>
<p><strong>agent molly starr</strong>: Who’s in charge?</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: I am.</p>
<p><strong>captain giordano</strong>: She is.</p>
<p><strong>agent molly starr</strong>: Oh, yeah… I’ll start with
him.</p>
<p><strong>agent molly starr</strong>: When people think of Italy they
think of food, wine, the Renaissance. They don’t realize Italy has the
scariest prisons in the civilized world. You know why? They’re all
leftover from the Middle Ages. They’re worse than dirty; they’re damp.
They’re like caves.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>agent molly starr</strong>: Testify against the others in the
Benedict case.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: I can’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>agent molly starr</strong>: Sure you can. You’ll get a year,
maybe two. The Italian charges will be dropped. You and the others will
be extradited to the US this afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>agent molly starr</strong>: Think about those prisons. Think
about living there for twenty years, getting out when you’re fifty. What
a catch you’ll be.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: Did you tell Dad?</p>
<p><strong>clint</strong>: Of course she did. We’re married, for God’s
sake.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Why didn’t you tell me?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I couldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Because you’re not an actress. You wouldn’t
have been so real.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: I thought you were going to jail.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I’m not going to jail.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: So you don’t think I’m a good actress.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You’re a terrible liar.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: I’m a good liar.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Where did Benedict find you?</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: He…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: At your parent’s house.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: That was…okay, so I’m not a good liar. So
what. You’re good enough for both of us.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: What the– Oh my God!</p>
<p><strong>199 continued: 199</strong>: ISABEL</p>
<p><strong>captain giordano</strong>: Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Guys. Get on there before they leave without
you. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>captain giordano</strong>: Hey, no problem. Good seeing you,
man.</p>
<p><strong>andriotti</strong>: Take care. See you back home.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Thanks, Scooter.</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: How was Rome, air?</p>
<p><strong>toulour</strong>: Put this in the safe, would you?</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: Of course, sir. Your guests are on the
veranda.</p>
<p><strong>toulour</strong>: Guests?</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: I hate you.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: This will ruin me.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: No, it won’t. Not if you come to
Zanzibar.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: What is it with Zanzibar?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: It’s where LeMarc is.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: That one’s ours. We can be there in three
hours.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Don’t you want to meet him? He wants to meet
you.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: You’re asking me to turn my back on my whole
life.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Would you miss it?</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: I’m a cop. That’s who I am.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: You’re only a cop because your father was a
thief.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: Who died in a Russian jail.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: According to you mother.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: It means you should meet LeMarc.</p>
<p><strong>toulour</strong>: Let me guess, you decided you did want to
give my lawyer a call. But you lost his card.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: No, nothing like that. We just came to
collect our money.</p>
<p><strong>toulour</strong>: Not only did you fail, half of your crew
got pinched! Your plan was not good. And you don’t look anything like
Julia Roberts! I mean your… …and your… …and your ears.</p>
<p><strong>toulour</strong>: Oh, no. You stole it on the way to Rome
didn’t you? I stole a replica.</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: He’s completely drunk.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>linus</strong>: We thought someone was following us.</p>
<p><strong>toulour</strong>: But that means you knew what to steal
before LeMarc proposed that I challenge you for it. That means…</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: Gaspar, it’s Rusty. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>toulour</strong>: LeMarc told you. Of course.</p>
<p><strong>toulour</strong>: To teach me.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Well, we’ll be in touch to make all the
arrangements.</p>
<p><strong>toulour</strong>: No. Don’t go. Please.</p>
<p><strong>toulour</strong>: You are my guests. I will celebrate your
victory. Besides, you may have noticed, I don’t like to be alone.</p>
<p><strong>toulour</strong>: I am feeling more French by the minute. To
my first depression.</p>
<p><strong>basher</strong>: So I think if you really analyze it, you can
see that it’s inevitable. It’s time for us to evolve, en masse. I have
to help bring that about whatever way I can, you know. Otherwise, the
trajectory is fixed. You know what I’m saying?</p>
<p><strong>saul</strong>: Mmm. Yes. But I’m through evolving, I think.
It’s too tiring. I feel pretty evolved. You know, considering.</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: I’ve got an idea for another Dominique
story.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Can we finish this one first?</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: Just let me tell it to you.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: It’s like three sentences.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: I’m serious; you’re asking too much.</p>
<p><strong>reuben</strong>: May I look at that when you’re through with
it?</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: All in all, it was depressingly
familiar. The forced camaraderie, the hollow smiles. Scared to take a
moment’s reflection. Scared to imagine a different life. We behaved like
boys. But…</p>
<p><strong>livingston</strong>: I’m Livingston Dell. Thanks for
listening.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: When do you want to go back?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Feel like traveling?</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Yeah. Don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>toulour</strong>: Tess. Danny. This is Monica Bellucci.</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>tess &amp; danny</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>toulour</strong>: We’re thinking of taking a trip to the
states. Take a look around. We’d love to meet some of your friends while
we’re there. Actually, one friend in particular.</p>
<p><strong>rusty</strong>: There he is.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: Gaspar? That was my fa–</p>
<p><strong>reuben</strong>: That’s the exact figure, I’m pretty
sure.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>reuben</strong>: So we’re clean?</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: You want it in writing?</p>
<p><strong>reuben</strong>: I’ll take your word.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: You’re clean.</p>
<p><strong>reuben</strong>: These grudges, they’re awful. Nobody
wine.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: As soon as someone retaliates, the
situation is out of control.</p>
<p><strong>reuben</strong>: This way, there’s no need for retaliation.
Why would there be?</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: There’s plenty for everyone.</p>
<p><strong>reuben</strong>: More than plenty. It’s just a matter of
sharing.</p>
<p><strong>benedict</strong>: Sharing is good.</p>
<p><strong>reuben</strong>: It is. Waiter? Can I get sparkling water?
It’s good for my acid reflux.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Of course.</p>
