<p><strong>police officer</strong>: Get back in your cars and continue
with the traffic. There is nothing you can do. Get back in your
cars…</p>
<p><strong>officer pierce</strong>: What’s the story?</p>
<p><strong>officer dana</strong>: She’s been dead about ten minutes. The
jaws are on the way… Ran a license check. Her name is Ellen Parker.
Forty-two years old.</p>
<p><strong>officer pierce</strong>: What about him?</p>
<p><strong>officer pierce</strong>: Shit… How old is he?</p>
<p><strong>officer dana</strong>: Seventeen. It’s his grandfather’s car.
On his way back from drinking with the ‘boys’.</p>
<p><strong>officer pierce</strong>: Who do we contact for her?</p>
<p><strong>officer dana</strong>: Her husband. Maurice Parker. They live
in Wynnewood. Married seventeen years.</p>
<p><strong>officer pierce</strong>: There isn’t any good left in the
world, Dana. Not one damn thing.</p>
<p><strong>angelo</strong>: Very good batch today.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: That one.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: The flowers… they’re beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: They are… who sent them?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: You thought I sent them?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: There was no card.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Have I forgotten something? Is this a
special day?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: It’s just a regular day.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: It’s from Dan and Kate Wilkins… for dinner
last week…</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: It’s a special day isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Well, I’m sure it’s not Christmas, because
you’d be worried about how much money we don’t have to spend on each
other… I know it’s not New Years, because you’d be going on and on about
wearing a tuxedo and how much you don’t like to dance… and I’m sure it’s
not our anniversary, because I didn’t find an envelope with a hundred
dollars cash on my bureau with a note that says, ‘Pick out something
pretty’… Yes – Maurice – I’m virtually certain it’s not a special day
today.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: You’re mad at me… You were beaming a minute
ago, but since I didn’t send the flowers… now you’re mad at me.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Why would I send flowers? What’s the
occasion.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Occasion? Because you love me… That’s the
occasion.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: I see that!</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: I’m getting a Doberman! Two!</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: You’ve been saying that for two years; I
think they know you’re bluffing.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: Lizy Bennett?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Hi Kris.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Lizy, Eliza… Elizabeth Bennett… Pride and
Prejudice.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: You’re amazing.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: It has to be a full character’s name.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: They called her ‘Lizy’ in the book… Sorry I
was late. My jeep died on the way over from the paper.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: They printed your article on, ‘Dry Verses
Can Dog Food’… Very enlightening.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: Pulitzer, here I come.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Never have children. If they’re not a
burden to you, they’re a burden to someone else.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Kris, go to the pharmacy. Ask Mr. Donnavan to
get you a large bottle of Geritol… Tell him, Maurice has officially
become a grumpy old man.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: What’d they take this time?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Nietzsche!… As if they’re going to read
Nietzsche.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: They pick on you because they can get a rise
out of you… children can sense those things.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: Monday – August 24… Juvenile delinquency – Are
the victims to blame?</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: Story ideas. I’ll forget them otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Two thousand square feet… We can add a used
book section.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Next door is a jewelry store with a
full-time security guard… He stands outside all day. Let’s see them try
and take Nietzsche then…</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Ellen?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: The new store?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Honey, I told you. If it makes you happy, we
should just do it.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: It’s a tremendous amount of work –
moving.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: We can do it together.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: What’s your’s say?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: … Love is shown through actions not just
words.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: What’s that? That’s not a fortune… You will
be rich… That’s a fortune. What you have is a statement.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: What it is – is the truth.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: I don’t follow.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Maurice, what would you do for me? What would
you do for our love? I’m not talking about saying, I’m talking about
doing.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Is this going to be similar to the flower
incident?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Sometimes people need to see things done for
them – because sooner or later they don’t believe the words anymore.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: You don’t think I love you?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I want to be shown… Maurice would you do
anything for me?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Anything?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: What do you want from me? Would I swim
across an ocean for you?… Would I walk across the United States for you?
Yes… Yes I would. You know that.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: No I don’t. I don’t even know if you’d walk
across the street for me.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: So what have you done for me that’s so
earth-shattering?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Why do you polish that thing all the
time?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: You’re talking to me?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Why do you polish it?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: A Book Society Award is a very prestigious
thing.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Why are you polishing it – in bed – in your
pajamas – at 11:15 at night? Are you going to show it to someone?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Then why?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: There’s no reason.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Exactly. No reason. No occasion. It just
makes you feel good to do something for it, to express your pride and
affection for it some how… How come you’d do that for a piece of metal
and not for me?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: I can do this.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: You missed mommie… worried when I didn’t come
down… my baby… so sweet.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: That one.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Onions?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Why do you put up with me?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Love… has something to do with it.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: I do love you… very, very much.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Show me.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: I will – I promise.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: History and the arts will be here…</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: The Classics…</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: We’ll have a hand-painted sign… … Parker
Books.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: This is my dream… it’s finally here.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: I wish my wife were here. She should see
this… She had a doctors appointment in Blue Bell. That’s a one and a
half hour drive. Ellen’s been going to that doctor since she moved to
Pennsylvania…</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: We could do this tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Ellen gave me strict orders to sign it… We
invited some friends over – you see, for a celebration.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Every journey begins with one step
right?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Enjoy your party Mr. Parker… Your new store
will be waiting for you Monday morning.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: … So she says the “L” word, after two dates,
the “L” word! She says ‘Don’t you believe in true love? Love that can
conquer all?’ I say, ‘Whoa, hold on. Just so we’re clear on things, I
think love these days is shit. It don’t mean a thing and it don’t stand
for nothing. Shit.’… You know what she says, ‘Fine, but how do you feel
about kids?’</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: It’s nice to see you don’t have any scars
from your divorce.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>gerald</strong>: Maurice, can we go into the dining room?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: What’s happened to my wife?</p>
<p><strong>gerald</strong>: There was a car accident… Drunk driver.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Please God – don’t do this.</p>
<p><strong>gerald</strong>: Maurice, it was serious… I don’t know how to
–</p>
<p><strong>gerald</strong>: Oh Jesus, please help me… She didn’t… Ellen
didn’t make it… Ellen’s dead Maurice.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Eat the food Claude…</p>
<p><strong>the house is silent except for the frantic chirping of
claude</strong>: FROM THE HALL. His hopeless cries punctuating the air
every few seconds.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Oh God… I’m sorry Ellen… I’m so sorry…</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Is it a boy or a girl?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Oh, that’s not mine.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: I don’t have kids.</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: You should. Children are a blessing from
God. I have four.</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Is that your husband?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: You look so happy – how long have you been
married?</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Forty-seven years.</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Are you married?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Yes… Seventeen years.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Where did he go?</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: He’s getting my sweater from the car. I
said there was a breeze. I told him not to go.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: May I ask you a question that might sound
strange?</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: How do you know he loves you?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: I mean besides… time – how did you know ten
years ago – twenty years ago?</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Because he shows me… he’s not much for
words, but he shows me.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Parker… Maurice Parker.</p>
<p><strong>dr. royce</strong>: So what’s the deal Maurice?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Pardon?</p>
<p><strong>dr. royce</strong>: I mean why the sudden voluntary visit –
usually it takes gun- point to get you in here…</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Routine, I assure you. I just wanted to
gage my health. Am I healthy?</p>
<p><strong>dr. royce</strong>: Yes – you are.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: I’m going to ask you a question that may
sound peculiar.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: How far could an individual walk if they
had no athletic training – you understand, just an ordinary person?</p>
<p><strong>dr. royce</strong>: I know what you’re getting at.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: You do?</p>
<p><strong>dr. royce</strong>: I’ve seen it before.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: You have?</p>
<p><strong>dr. royce</strong>: You’re feeling old and you want to start
exercising. A lot of men your age feel the need to recapture their
youth. Don’t feel embarrassed about it.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>dr. royce</strong>: You should start slow and easy – fifteen
minutes a day.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: No. How far in one attempt – what’s the
farthest someone like myself could walk?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Just for curiosity sake that’s all?</p>
<p><strong>dr. royce</strong>: I don’t know – maybe twenty miles… Of
course I’m not recommending that… if someone like you had to I mean…
that’s how far they’d probably get before encountering serious physical
walls.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Twenty miles? I see.</p>
<p><strong>joselle</strong>: Each inch represents 150 miles…</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Making the grand total?</p>
<p><strong>joselle</strong>: Damn baby, relax. I’m getting to it. From
Philadelphia following the route highlighted to Pacifica California –
you’re traveling an estimated three thousand two hundred miles…</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Three thousand miles?… How many times does
twenty go into three thousand?</p>
<p><strong>joselle</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Perhaps there’s another route?</p>
<p><strong>joselle</strong>: This is the route approved by triple A.
Even if you followed back roads the entire way, you’d still be looking
at roughly the same distance…</p>
<p><strong>joselle</strong>: Don’t worry baby, it shouldn’t take you
more than five days if you just stop to sleep and eat.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: By car right?</p>
<p><strong>joselle</strong>: How else you gonna get there on the
ground?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Why do you want to be a journalist Kris?
What sparked your interest?</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: I want to reach people. Nobody listens to me.
This is my way to reach them.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: To reach people, you have to feel something
first… You write about the wrong things. How can you feel for dog food?
The people at the Gazette don’t respect it, and neither do you.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: This is a ghost town. Nothing ever
happens.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Write from your heart. That’s why the
classics are great.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: Why are you telling me this Mr. Parker?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Your bus is arriving.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: It’s one month’s pay.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: Are you firing me?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: No. No… I won’t be here for a while. The
store will be closed in the interim.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: You going on a trip Mr. Parker?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: California.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: That’s cool. What day are you arriving?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: I’m not sure – sometime in January I
think.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: When are you leaving?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: I’m walking there Kris.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: Walking where?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: California.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: The hairs on my arm are standing up… Something
strange is happening.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: I always knew you had good instincts…
Goodbye Kris. I’ll see you when I get back.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: Thursday, September 25… ‘The Death Of A Spouse
- Can It Drive You Insane?’</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: I know how you feel.</p>
<p><strong>young maurice</strong>: Three dollars a piece… Two for four
dollars! All the classics!</p>
<p><strong>young maurice</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>young ellen</strong>: My father owns the food stall over
there.</p>
<p><strong>young ellen</strong>: You look thirsty.</p>
<p><strong>young maurice</strong>: Hi, I’m Ellen.</p>
<p><strong>young maurice</strong>: Maurice.</p>
<p><strong>young ellen</strong>: Not doing too good huh?</p>
<p><strong>young ellen</strong>: It’ll pick up. I’ve been coming to
these things my whole life… people don’t want to carry things as they
walk around… you’ll sell as the fair starts to end…</p>
<p><strong>young ellen</strong>: You don’t talk much do you?</p>
<p><strong>young maurice</strong>: I read a lot.</p>
<p><strong>young maurice</strong>: I better go… … Come over if you get
hungry.</p>
<p><strong>young maurice</strong>: I read a lot?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Are you trying to tell me something?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Walk with me?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: You like to take walks?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: No. But I want to take a walk with you.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: You just said something very sweet.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: What are you thinking?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: It’s one of those thoughts you keep to
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Please tell me.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I was just thinking that if we actually
became a couple – this was a beautiful place to begin things.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: I love you Ellen.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: Phileas Fogg?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: … Round The World In Eighty Days. … Hello
Kris.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: You’re amazing… What are you doing
Mr. Parker?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: I told you.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: You’re walking to California?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Pacifica, California – it’s a coastal
city.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: Oh, a coastal city. That’s good.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Ellen told me that she didn’t know if I
loved her.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: She knew you loved her.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: She wasn’t certain… I never really showed
her.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: I’m really lost. What does this have to do
with walking?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: I said, ‘I would do anything for her’… and
she didn’t believe me. I said, ‘I’d walk across the country for her’…
she didn’t believe me.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: I need to show her how much I love her
Kris.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: Why know?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Because I should have shown her before…
Everyday, I should have shown her.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: Pacifica, California… that’s a long ways
away.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: So I’ve been informed.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: Shit Mr. Parker. You can’t walk across the
United States – it’s over three thousand miles.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Ellen got up every morning and went to the
corner store to get me my bread for breakfast… Everyday. Now that’s
about a quarter mile each way… 17 years… that comes to about three
thousand miles… And you know what Kris?</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: What Mr. Parker?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: She never ate a slice.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: Thursday, September 26… ‘The Question We Never
Ask - What Would We Do For Love?’</p>
<p><strong>machine</strong>: Hello you’ve reached Parker Books – our
store hours are eight to six…</p>
<p><strong>adelle</strong>: Something’s wrong. I’m worried.</p>
<p><strong>gerald</strong>: He probably just went somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>adelle</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>gerald</strong>: For a walk. I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>adelle</strong>: Uncle Maurice? Are you kidding? He hates
walking.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Pool times are 11 am to 5 pm, there’s cable
in every room with two premium channels. HBO and CINEMAX. Pay Per View
Channels can be –</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: I need a bed and I need Tylenol… that’s
all.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: The room comes with two twin Sealy
Posturepedics… but the Tylenol will be extra.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Someone’s got a hot story.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: What time did you get in?</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: Five… Couldn’t sleep.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What’s this one about Kris? ‘Blinds or
Curtains - The Eternal Question?’</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: No, no… ‘Boxers Verses Tight Undies - The
Battle Continues.’</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: Read about it on Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>gerald</strong>: Smells good, honey.</p>
<p><strong>adelle</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>gerald</strong>: Adelle… Maurice is in the paper.</p>
<p><strong>adelle</strong>: Oh my God.</p>
<p><strong>gerald</strong>: Honey.</p>
<p><strong>dally</strong>: What would you like us to do?</p>
<p><strong>adelle</strong>: Put out a P.B.S…. Or whatever it’s
called.</p>
<p><strong>dally</strong>: A.P.B…. He isn’t breaking any law. He’s a
grown man… He can crawl on his hands and knees to China if that’s what
he wants to do.</p>
<p><strong>adelle</strong>: Sergeant, I’m a psychologist and I know the
difference between normal whims people have and actions that clearly
display psychological problems… My uncle lost his wife and it devastated
him.</p>
<p><strong>dally</strong>: We’re very sorry about that. Some of our men
were on the scene of the accident.</p>
<p><strong>adelle</strong>: I think my uncle is suffering from a
condition called Mania which is linked with depression. It is a time
when an individual will act over-confident, and will act out
impractical, grandiose plans. Sometimes these plans can be
dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>dally</strong>: How long does this… Mania last?</p>
<p><strong>adelle</strong>: A couple days to a few months if
untreated.</p>
<p><strong>dally</strong>: Look, I’ll see if anyone has spotted him
recently. If I get any information, I’ll call you.</p>
<p><strong>adelle</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>dally</strong>: Don’t wait by the phone. If he’s really been
walking this whole time, he’s out of our jurisdiction…</p>
<p><strong>dally</strong>: Don’t worry he’ll be back. He’s in his
forties. He’s had no physical training… He’ll be back by the end of the
week.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Nice sneaks.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: They are?</p>
<p><strong>boy 2</strong>: Sure man, High-Top Nike Cross Trainers with
heel supports and air cushioned soles – They’re nasty.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: I thought we both wanted the same
things.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I’ve changed my mind.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: You can’t change your mind.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I want children.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: You’ve just decided, is that right?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Ellen, there are two kinds of people in the
world –</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Please not, ‘The two kinds of people’
speech.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: … People that were made to be parents, and
people who were not made to be parents… My parents, were people who were
not made to be parents but had kids anyway. I don’t want us to be that
way Ellen.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: You can change.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Face it Ellen, I’m not the type of person
who reads bedtime stories. But you love me anyway.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Don’t be so sure.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: What if something happens to one of us? We’ll
be all alone.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Nothing will happen to us. It’s a bleak
picture, I know, but we’re going to be together till were old and grey
and you don’t remember my name anymore.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Let me think about it okay.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: I’m not saying anytime soon. I’m just
saying that maybe we can consider it down the road sometime.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I love you Maurice Parker.</p>
<p><strong>cashier</strong>: I can show you the main roads, but that’ll
add ten miles to your trip. Do you mind ten miles?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: I mind.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Excuse me, who’s truck is this?</p>
<p><strong>denny</strong>: Mine.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Are you and your friends planning on
driving soon?</p>
<p><strong>denny</strong>: Yes we are. Who the fuck are you?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: You don’t know me from Adam, but I want you
to do something for me. I want you to wait until you sobered up before
you get behind the wheel. I know this is out of the ordinary, but one
man to another, would you do me that favor?</p>
<p><strong>denny</strong>: Are you a preacher?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: No, I just don’t want anybody dying because
I didn’t say something when I had the chance.</p>
<p><strong>denny</strong>: I’ll drive my truck shit-faced if I want to.
You better turn around and walk away preacher. You don’t know who you’re
talking to.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: This is Indiana – nothing’s going to happen
to you.</p>
<p><strong>denny</strong>: You need a ride, Preacher?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: No thank you I’ll walk.</p>
<p><strong>wil</strong>: Where you coming from?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Look gentlemen, I’m late, I need to –</p>
<p><strong>denny</strong>: I’ve been thinking – who the hell is this
preacher guy? Coming up to me and my friends? Looking like he wanted to
kick my ass for drinking?</p>
<p><strong>denny</strong>: Then I figured it. You’re angry. You lost
somebody, because some asshole was drinking.</p>
<p><strong>denny</strong>: Maybe you lost a son? A sister? A wife?</p>
<p><strong>denny</strong>: A wife?… Did someone piss drunk run into your
wife? Crushed her like a bug. Snapped her bones?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: That’s enough.</p>
<p><strong>denny</strong>: Oh the preacher’s getting angry again… Tell
me something. Did she die instantly or did she feel every torn muscle
and shattered bone? Were you there to help her? Or were you safe at home
when the windshield sliced into her face –</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: I’ll kill you!</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: Step away from him now!</p>
<p><strong>officer grey</strong>: Need an I.D. check on a Maurice A.
Parker…</p>
<p><strong>officer grey</strong>: Driver’s number 22 184 877… He was
assaulted by a group of men just outside Elkhart, Indiana…</p>
<p><strong>dally</strong>: How is he?… That’s good.</p>
<p><strong>dally</strong>: Call Adelle Matlin… tell her we found her
uncle.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: Jesus – he’s walked six hundred miles.</p>
<p><strong>grey</strong>: Mrs. Matlin… good morning.</p>
<p><strong>adelle</strong>: Uncle Maurice, you’re wearing sneakers?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: High-top Nike Cross-Trainers with heel
support and air-cushioned soles. They’re nasty.</p>
<p><strong>grey</strong>: My shift ended an hour ago.</p>
<p><strong>grey</strong>: It’s for my wife.</p>
<p><strong>adelle</strong>: What’s the occasion?</p>
<p><strong>grey</strong>: No occasion.</p>
<p><strong>grey</strong>: You can use the conference room, if you want
to talk.</p>
<p><strong>adelle</strong>: That won’t be necessary.</p>
<p><strong>grey</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>adelle</strong>: We can talk on the way back – I rented a
car.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: It’ll be kind of hard to talk, since you’ll
be in the car and I won’t.</p>
<p><strong>grey</strong>: The conference room is down the hall on your
right.</p>
<p><strong>adelle</strong>: And your store? What about your new store?
What about all your dreams?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: I have new dreams now.</p>
<p><strong>adelle</strong>: I don’t accept that.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Maybe one day – after you’ve been married
twenty years you’ll understand.</p>
<p><strong>adelle</strong>: Uncle Maurice – I spent all our frequent
flyer miles on a one way ticket here… I have a rented car outside, just
listen to me. Come back with me now, and if you still want to do
something like this in a year – maybe we’ll plan a car trip across the
country – Gerald and I will come along –</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: I have to walk – by myself – all the way –
every inch.</p>
<p><strong>adelle</strong>: It’s impossible.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: It’s what she asked for… It’s what I’m
going to do.</p>
<p><strong>adelle</strong>: She was being symbolic. What if she asked
you to fly to the moon?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: You’d be visiting me at Nasa.</p>
<p><strong>adelle</strong>: What if you don’t make it?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: I’ll make it.</p>
<p><strong>adelle</strong>: If you really want to do this… plan it out.
Rest up. Train for it. Build up your body. Plan every stop along the
way. How much money? Time? Really do it properly. This is all so – by
the seat of your pants.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: No it’s not.</p>
<p><strong>adelle</strong>: Why did you take the back roads here?
They’re not safe. You’d know that if you’d planned.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: I’ve all ready gone six hundred miles… I
can’t do it again.</p>
<p><strong>adelle</strong>: If you can’t redo these six hundred miles
when you’re rested and ready, how are you possible going to walk another
two thousand-five hundred miles in your present condition?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Nothing’s going to happen.</p>
<p><strong>adelle</strong>: Uncle, the way I was told, if that police
car didn’t happen down that road, you would be dead right now. That guy
Denny, had jumped bail in another state, he’s dangerous… They’ll be
other Dennys, if you don’t plan.</p>
<p><strong>adelle</strong>: Ellen, deserves you to do this right. Really
make it – if you’re going to do it. She deserves it.</p>
<p><strong>adelle</strong>: Do you want this? It’s a long ride.</p>
<p><strong>adelle</strong>: We’ll figure everything out when we get
there… Oh, he’s going to need a lot of help with this… He wasn’t even
going to come with me, I had to tell him that he could do the walk later
if he plans well… I know, but by that time I’ll have gotten him some
treatment… I just want to get back home before he changes his mind.</p>
<p><strong>adelle</strong>: You want something to eat?</p>
<p><strong>adelle</strong>: I know you’re feeling a lot of emotions
right now. It’s okay to be mad. It’s okay to feel helpless. It’s part of
the healing process. I understand. I do.</p>
<p><strong>adelle</strong>: He was exhausted – slept the whole way.</p>
<p><strong>adelle</strong>: Uncle Maurice we’re home… Uncle Maurice.</p>
<p><strong>adelle</strong>: Uncle Maurice?</p>
<p><strong>homeless man</strong>: So this is the City of Brotherly
Love.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Ellen would have loved you.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: How did that happen?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: It must’ve hit the window… I think its neck
is broken.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Don’t bring it in here – it probably has
all kinds of diseases.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: It isn’t going to make it Ellen. Let the
poor thing go quietly.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: It’ll make it.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: You must miss flying. Being way up there in
the clouds looking down at all of us. You miss that don’t you? You miss
playing with your friends and talking with them…</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Maurice! Maurice! Come out here.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: I don’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: All he needed was love. Once you have that,
you can do anything.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: You’ll be all right. A couple days and
you’ll be up there again.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Ellen would have loved you.</p>
<p><strong>adelle</strong>: Yes I understand, it does sound humorous,
but this is a very serious situation.</p>
<p><strong>gerald</strong>: This smells good.</p>
<p><strong>adelle</strong>: Why am I such an authority?</p>
<p><strong>gerald</strong>: Here comes the resume.</p>
<p><strong>adelle</strong>: I received my B.S. from the University of
Pennsylvania, my P.H.D. from Bryn Mawr College. I worked three years at
the Boston University School of Medicine, during which time I had
articles printed in the “Journal of Educational Psychology”, “American
Journal of Psychology”, “Psychology Review” and “Science”… So I think
it’s safe to say my opinion is valid.</p>
<p><strong>adelle</strong>: Look, please find him for me… Officer, I
tried… but I brought back the wrong person.</p>
<p><strong>adelle</strong>: Stop laughing!</p>
<p><strong>gerald</strong>: Adelle –</p>
<p><strong>adelle</strong>: He says he admires him.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: It’s okay. It’s all over.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Is she okay?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Oh no… she’s wearing a seat-belt.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: It wasn’t my fault. It wasn’t my fault.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Come on… please…</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Please…</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: No Ellen… don’t die…</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Everything’s going to be fine Ellen. I
won’t let anything happen to you. I love you sweetie. Everything’s going
to be different now.</p>
<p><strong>hansen</strong>: What’s his story?</p>
<p><strong>tandy</strong>: His name is Maurice. He’s dancing around
everything else.</p>
<p><strong>hansen</strong>: Red flag, man.</p>
<p><strong>tandy</strong>: If he’s in trouble with the law – fine. Not
our problem. He yanked two people from a car wreck, let’s give him some
space.</p>
<p><strong>hansen</strong>: Maurice, you need anything? Which way were
you headed? We can drive you.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: No thank you officer. I’ll walk.</p>
<p><strong>hansen</strong>: Grub? Food? How about food? Our dime at the
local diner…</p>
<p><strong>hansen</strong>: Come on man, you’re a hero. In Nebraska we
don’t let hero’s walk around with empty stomachs.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: … I need to be brought back here.</p>
<p><strong>hansen</strong>: Deal.</p>
<p><strong>hansen</strong>: You look like shit Maurice.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Getting old.</p>
<p><strong>tandy</strong>: How long have you been footing it
Maurice?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Too long… Excuse me gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>hansen</strong>: Red flags man.</p>
<p><strong>tandy</strong>: Not our problem.</p>
<p><strong>hansen</strong>: Why so vague? Why so evasive? He could be
somebody hot.</p>
<p><strong>tandy</strong>: Not our problem.</p>
<p><strong>hansen</strong>: It’s going to look beautiful when he turns
out to be that animal who paid a visit to the Steadman’s house.</p>
<p><strong>tandy</strong>: This guy’s not a murderer.</p>
<p><strong>hansen</strong>: If he is, half the town has seen us take him
out for dinner like a couple of jack-asses.</p>
<p><strong>hansen</strong>: If he’s clean, he’ll never know about
it.</p>
<p><strong>tandy</strong>: Do it quick.</p>
<p><strong>hansen</strong>: A marriage certificate? Who the hell carries
their marriage certificate around?</p>
<p><strong>tandy</strong>: Maurice and Ellen Parker… it was issued in
Philly… Mr. Maurice Parker has come a long way from home. Why?</p>
<p><strong>tandy</strong>: Hansen’s whipped. Has to call his wife every
two hours or she’ll go ballistic when he gets home.</p>
<p><strong>hansen</strong>: P-A-R-K-E-R. Right. Get on the horn with
Philly. Call me here.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Line one Sarg.</p>
<p><strong>dally</strong>: I’m not here.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: It’s the Nebraska state police.</p>
<p><strong>dally</strong>: Nebraska?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: You know somebody named – Maurice Parker?</p>
<p><strong>dally</strong>: That son of a bitch made it to Nebraska.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>c.b./nebraska police</strong>: … He saved a little girl, and
her mother. Pulled them right out of the car…</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Umm, Elm Creek, Nebraska.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: This story is big huh?</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: Mammoth.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: The Gazette’s small huh?</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: What are you saying? This story is too big for
this paper?</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Umm, no. It’s just that –</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: God damn, you’re right… You don’t say much
Michelle, but what you say is golden.</p>
<p><strong>hansen</strong>: I was expecting a call.</p>
<p><strong>tandy</strong>: Whipped.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: … I’m on first name basis with half the
city of Philadelphia… Hansen, apparently this guy Parker lost his wife
and went a little fruity. I spoke with his niece, Adelle Matlin and she
says to restrain him. That he’s dangerous to himself. She says to call
when we have him in the station.</p>
<p><strong>hansen</strong>: Good work.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Where are you taking me?</p>
<p><strong>hansen</strong>: I’m going to drop off Tandy at the station
and then drop you back.</p>
<p><strong>tandy</strong>: That’s all right isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>hansen</strong>: What the hell was that?</p>
<p><strong>tandy</strong>: Shit! He jumped!</p>
<p><strong>hansen</strong>: Jumped where?</p>
<p><strong>tandy</strong>: Out of the car. He jumped out of the god damn
car!</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: What did they ask?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: If I had seen you. By the way I’m sorry
about your wife. They told me.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Thank you… I’m sorry you had to lie. It
must have been difficult.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: I asked the officers if you had committed
some crime… If they had said ‘yes’, you would be speaking with them
right now.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Take these, and if you’re up to it, try to
explain how it is you came to be sitting here.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: I’m walking for my wife.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: To where?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Pacifica, California.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: From where?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Do you believe a person’s soul lives on
after their death?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Most certainly.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: And that that soul takes part of the person
they were on this earth with them.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: That’s a reasonable assumption.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: I don’t want my wife’s soul having any
doubts.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Doubts? About what?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: About my love for her.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: You don’t have to prove anything to her.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: I’m not proving to her. I’m showing her.
And I know I don’t have to. I want to. I’ve realized, love is about
giving. I’m alive, I can still give to her. I want to give her
everything I can.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: There are some people, including those
officers, that are trying to stop me. They mean well. But they don’t
understand. I wouldn’t either if I were them.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: I want you to stay here a few days until
you’re better. You’re no use to your wife in this condition.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: You think I’m crazy too.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: I have spent my life dedicated to love. Love
of God. Love of humanity. And here you are living through love. Bathing
in it. Using its strength, its magic, its ability to overcome any
barrier… If you are crazy, I hope my insanity is not far off.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Well, hello.</p>
<p><strong>isaac</strong>: I’m Isaac… I’m three.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: I’m Maurice Parker… I’m much older than
three. Are your parents home?</p>
<p><strong>isaac</strong>: You know what, I can play baseball with my
brothers when I’m bigger.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Is that right?</p>
<p><strong>isaac</strong>: You know what… I’m just little now, but I’ll
be big soon.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: You’ll probably be bigger than your
brothers.</p>
<p><strong>isaac</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caldwell</strong>: Who are you talking to Isaac?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Hello, I’m Maurice Parker. I’m just passing
through and I need to conserve what little funds I have… I need some
food and a roof to sleep under for one night… Now I don’t look like
much, but if there are any things that need to get done around the house
–</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caldwell</strong>: Dave… you’re not going to believe
who’s here.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caldwell</strong>: This is Maurice Parker – the one
walking for his wife.</p>
<p><strong>mr. caldwell</strong>: If that ain’t fate?… Hi, I’m Dave
Caldwell. I do the copy for the anchor on the evening news down
here.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Evening News?</p>
<p><strong>mr. caldwell</strong>: We did a piece after your story ran in
the New York Times.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: New York Times?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caldwell</strong>: Someone said they spotted you in
town… Mr. Parker, you’re a celebrity.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: I thought you were asleep.</p>
<p><strong>isaac</strong>: You know what… I remembered you were here and
I woke up.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Your parents would want you to be in
bed.</p>
<p><strong>isaac</strong>: You tell stories?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Oh no… I’m not good at that. Very bad in
fact…</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: I would be exceedingly boring.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: I don’t do these type of things.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: See there are two kinds of people in this
world. … Just a short one okay?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: There was a boy named Isaac who wanted to
play baseball, but he was too small and no one would let him play… but
he kept practicing by himself – waiting… He went to every game and sat
in the stands with his glove.</p>
<p><strong>isaac</strong>: You know what… maybe I ran onto the field and
hit a home run.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Who’s telling this story?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Good, now the team had this great big
player – Big Billy. He was the best. He had them in the World
Super-Bowl-Championship of little kids baseball. But right before the
game, the second best player on the team was suspended because he played
a prank on a nice man who owned a book store… When that boy grew up he
was convicted on burglary charges and spent fifteen years in prison –
where he belongs.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Anyway, Big Billy needed another player so
he yelled into the stands. ‘Who can play baseball?’ And there was a
little voice that yelled out, ‘Me, I can play.’ Everyone turned to see a
little boy standing with a glove.</p>
<p><strong>isaac</strong>: That’s me.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Right. But everyone saw how small Isaac was
and laughed… but not Big Billy. He stared at Isaac carefully and then
told him to join the game. It came to the end of the game. It was the
eleventh or twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game…</p>
<p><strong>isaac</strong>: Nine.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Okay nine. Big Billy’s team was losing and
he was on base. That’s when Isaac came up. He could barely hold the bat…
Big Billy winked at Isaac… The ball was pitched – Isaac hit the ball
hard. It soared up and out over the stadium. Everyone cheered. Isaac hit
a home run and won the game. After the game, Isaac asked Big Billy why
he let he play. Big Billy smiled and said, I wasn’t always Big Billy, I
was Little Billy first… Isaac and Big Billy went off after the game and
read a classic book together. The end.</p>
<p><strong>isaac</strong>: You know what – that was a really good story…
Tell it again.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: There was a boy named Isaac who liked to
play baseball…</p>
<p><strong>mr. caldwell</strong>: That’s a nice watch.</p>
<p><strong>mr. caldwell</strong>: I’ve always wanted a watch like
that.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: It’s yours.</p>
<p><strong>mr. caldwell</strong>: No. I won’t take it unless I pay for
it… Let’s see, that’s a pretty nice watch – I can see that.</p>
<p><strong>mr. caldwell</strong>: Let’s say I give you what’s in this
envelope for that beautiful watch.</p>
<p><strong>mr. caldwell</strong>: I really want that watch.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: This isn’t right.</p>
<p><strong>mr. caldwell</strong>: This is my only chance to get a watch
like that. It would mean a lot to me and my family. Please take it. It
really isn’t that much.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: This is a loan.</p>
<p><strong>mr. caldwell</strong>: Isaac, come back here.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: I have to go now.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Why didn’t I meet you fifteen years
ago?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: What’s wrong? They said something was
wrong?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Everyone’s here. Everything looks beautiful.
They even got the white dove I wanted for the cake – so what’s wrong?
What is it?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: It’s him.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Your father?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: He’s plastered.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: That’s okay – really it is.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: No it’s not. He should be here with me now,
not trying to find some fucking bottle of Johnny Walker. He’s never been
there for me. I’ve always been alone.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: I’m afraid Ellen… I’m scared of being alone
again. What if one day you realize how boring I am? What if one day you
realize you’re not happy? I could have been alone before, but now you’ve
changed things. I can’t be alone anymore Ellen. I’m scared what’s going
to happen to me.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: The day I met you, I gave you my heart.
Today, I give you my soul. Where ever you are, where ever you go, I will
be with you. Maurice Parker, I promise – I promise, you will never be
alone again.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: – Come on Pete, this is important, this is
racism in our backyard… Aw, that’s bull… just think about it, okay?</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: They’re pushing my Jewish temple vandalism
story to the Metro section…</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: Michelle, breathe… that’s it, what is it, talk
to me.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Umm, Coalville Utah.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: He’s taking highway 80 all the way.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: You know what this is, don’t you? It’s a
miracle. Not like… ‘It was a miracle little Johnny passed his math
test.’ No! This is a real miracle… Turning water to wine kind of
miracle. People should know about this, everyone, every single person…
It’s time for a blitz. Let’s see what kind of TV interest we can
generate.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Umm, he’s going to make it isn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: But he hasn’t hit the toughest miles yet.</p>
<p><strong>tv anchor</strong>: What would you do for love? This is the
question Americans are starting to ask themselves. The incredible tale
of Maurice Parker’s walk across the country has caught the imaginations
of young and old.</p>
<p><strong>tv anchor</strong>: At 44, this bookstore owner from
Wynnewood Pennsylvania has tallied an estimated 2,400 miles. His latest
appearance in Coalville Utah brought the spotlight of the country to
that small town.</p>
<p><strong>gerald</strong>: Coalville Utah?</p>
<p><strong>adelle</strong>: I can’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>tv anchor</strong>: Whatever has carried Mr. Parker through
snow and rain and thousands of miles of this countryside, will have to
carry him through the most dangerous part of his trek… The three hundred
miles through the sweltering roads of Nevada…</p>
<p><strong>adelle</strong>: My God.</p>
<p><strong>becomes slightly larger – pulling away from the hill by
a</strong>: FRACTION OF AN INCH. It stabilizes there.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: It’s over Ellen… I failed you again.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: I tried Ellen, I really tried… I don’t have
the strength.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: You said I would never be alone!… You
promised… … You promised.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Hey, man are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: What the hell are you doing out here? You
need a ride somewhere?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: No thank you.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: You by yourself?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>janis</strong>: Who is that?</p>
<p><strong>ammie</strong>: I don’t know. What’s the matter with him?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Good morning Mr. Parker.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: There are a lot of people worried about
you.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Where am I?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: In a hospital.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Which hospital? Did you take me back?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: You are in St. Vincent’s Hospital in
Roseville California. You’ve been here three days.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Thank God.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: I can’t believe you’re here. I’m
touched.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Are you two planning kids?</p>
<p><strong>adelle</strong>: Maybe later.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: You should definitely have children.
They’re really special.</p>
<p><strong>adelle</strong>: I don’t think you realize how serious this
is Uncle.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: How serious is it?</p>
<p><strong>dr. ray</strong>: You have two broken ribs, a punctured
spleen and Acute Rheumatoid Arthritis.</p>
<p><strong>dr. ray</strong>: The normal amount of build up in your
arteries has been aggravated by over exertion. This is called,
“Claudication,” As a result, there isn’t enough circulation to your
body. That accounts for the discoloration in your extremities and the
muscle spasms I’m sure you’ve encountered.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Can it kill me?</p>
<p><strong>dr. ray</strong>: It can, but it’ll have to wait in line.</p>
<p><strong>dr. ray</strong>: We ran a C.T. and an M.R.I. We found
bleeding in your brain. Your collapse was caused by “Transient
Cerebral-Ischemia”… a sudden loss of blood circulation to the brain. In
other words, Mr. Parker, you had a mild stroke.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: I suppose I over did it.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: What steps do we take now?</p>
<p><strong>dr. ray</strong>: We operate. We find the artery in the brain
and close the bleeding… I just did this procedure on a Senator and he’s
doing fine.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: What are the odds? Do I have a fifty-fifty
chance of surviving the operation?</p>
<p><strong>dr. ray</strong>: It’s hard to say. It’s a delicate surgery.
There’s no getting around the fact that it’s a very high-risk
situation.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Then it’ll have to wait until I finish.</p>
<p><strong>adelle</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: I finish the walk, and then we may take all
the chances we want.</p>
<p><strong>adelle</strong>: Listen to me very carefully, because I don’t
want you to misunderstand me… The walk is over Uncle Maurice. Done.
Finished. You’ve made it to California, it was a miracle, now let’s try
to save your life.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: I’m completing the walk. I’m almost
there.</p>
<p><strong>dr. ray</strong>: Okay, Maurice keep it calm… We can talk
about this again, but just so you know, we have a guard on this floor
who’s sole job it is to keep an eye on you.</p>
<p><strong>dr. ray</strong>: There are a lot of people out there who
would like to see you finish, including me, but I’m not willing to put
your life in anymore risk than it is… We do the operation, and when
you’re better, you finish the walk.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Hello, Mr. Parker.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: How are you feeling?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Confused. I’m not sure what to do now. I’m
not sure what he wants for me.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: He wants to reward you… That’s why I’m
here.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: I mean you’ve done a great thing. You should
be rewarded monetarily.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: What’s your shoe size?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: What? Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Clive Silver – Marketing Executive at
Reebok.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: We want you to do some spots for us.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: What the hell is this?</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: I’m talking six figures, pay or play – for
two spots. We want to push a new line with you… America’s New Hero.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: Imagine grainy black and white shots of long
stretches of highway – quick cuts with a slow pounding beat underneath…
Then we see a man walking up a steep incline – it’s you Maurice. We see
shots of you walking. Cut. Cut. Cut. Fast… Music crescendoes – Bham!
Close up – and you say… ‘Reebok, Because There’s Nothing You Can’t
Do.’</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: My wife is dead.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Good night Mr. Parker. I’ll see you
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: Tom Joad?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: … The Grapes of Wrath.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: You’re amazing.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: I missed you Kris.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: I missed you to Mr. Parker.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Adelle told me, your writing is going well.
The Crusader for social issues and all.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: You were right. From the heart is always
better.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: I drove by the bookstore – it’s boarded up
now. There’s a sign over the wood – “Office space available.”</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: I haven’t been too punctual with the
rent.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: I was thinking you could open another store
with investors. I’m sure a lot of people would want to get involved with
you now.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Actually, I’m not worried about my career
right now… I’m more worried about how you’re getting me out of here?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Are they standing?</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: Saluting.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: Come on Mr. Parker.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: What, come on?</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: I can’t do it. I want you to finish, but I
want you to live more.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: We do the operation after I finish. I can’t
risk not finishing… I thought you understood what I was doing.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Why in God’s name did you fly all the way
here then?</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: Don’t do this.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: … To look me in the eye and say what’s
important to you isn’t as important to me? To tell me you know what’s
best? To tell me life is more precious than what I feel for my wife?</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: Mr. Parker, you can yell at me, if it’ll help.
But I’m not risking your life.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: It’s mine to risk.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: Your operation is scheduled for Friday. I’ll
be back before then.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: She knows you love her Mr. Parker. She knows
now.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: No more words. Until I touch the ocean with
my hands… it’s all just words.</p>
<p><strong>head nurse</strong>: You cooperate with us about taking your
medicine and maybe we’ll talk about candy.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: You should be in bed.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: What do your friends call you?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Steph.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Do you have a car, Steph?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: You should be in bed…</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: You’re in pain.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: I need your help.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: They told me, you might try to talk me
into something… You need to rest Mr. Parker… It’s for your own good.
I’ve been following your story for a long while. It’s a beautiful thing
you did.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: You ever lose somebody Stephanie?</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Mr. Parker, I’m supposed to give you your
fish sticks.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: … My father.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Did you tell him everything you wanted to?
Did you do everything you could while he was here?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: If I don’t do this Steph, my life isn’t
worth saving.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Please, help me.</p>
<p><strong>female doctor</strong>: Excuse me, doctor…</p>
<p><strong>female doctor</strong>: Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: This is it… This is where I fell.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: I never thanked my father. He did so much
for me… I never thanked him.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: It’s not too late.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: You’re going to have a lot of work to do
when I get back.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Someone should be with you.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Someone is.</p>
<p><strong>newton</strong>: I’m afraid Mrs. Matlin is very upset.</p>
<p><strong>adelle</strong>: … “American Journal of Psychology”,
“Psychological Review”, and “Science”, so I think it’s safe to say my
opinion is valid.</p>
<p><strong>adelle</strong>: How does a grown man who can barely walk,
just stroll out?… This is not James Bond here, this is my uncle who owns
a bookstore, and gets outwitted by grade school kids pulling pranks!</p>
<p><strong>newton</strong>: Mrs. Matlin, this is Sergeant Emory. He’ll
help us find your uncle.</p>
<p><strong>adelle</strong>: Let me tell you a story Sergeant. There was
a patient of mine who had a Golden Retriever, Mac… She loved Mac, not
like a pet, but like a family member. One day, she had to leave Mac with
‘friends’, and wouldn’t you know it, Mac gets away and ends up falling
into a sewer. My patient comes back – goes nuts when she hears that Mac
has been in the sewer for over 48 hours. Apparently the cop who found
the dog didn’t want to get his pants dirty. And neither did anyone else.
So of course, my patient decides to go in after it… she falls… breaks
her hip and lands next to her dead dog, who died of toxic fumes down
there…</p>
<p><strong>adelle</strong>: The moral of the story is… She sued for a
lot of money! She sued the friends, the city, and the officer for
negligence on duty. She has no Mac, no happiness, but she’s very rich
now… That was a dog. We’re talking about a human being… I hope everyone
clearly understands the chain of events that will occur if something
should happen to my uncle, whom I love more than you can possibly
imagine… Now Sergeant I would like to know right now, if you’re willing
to get your pants dirty for my uncle?</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: I found him sneaking up the back stairs
with this.</p>
<p><strong>emory</strong>: Did you help Mr. Parker leave this
hospital?</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: No… But I was going to.</p>
<p><strong>emory</strong>: Forget him. It’s time to get our pants
dirty.</p>
<p><strong>emory</strong>: I want three black and whites from here to
Handley Avenue. And no communication with the station. The press
monitors the transmissions.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: They can do that?</p>
<p><strong>emory</strong>: That goes for all of you. Not a word about
this disappearance to anyone. Absolutely no press.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: He has Epilepsy, just give him room… An
ambulance is on the way.</p>
<p><strong>klein</strong>: … L.A. Times – ‘He’s Back.’… San Francisco
Chronicle – ‘Have You Seen Maurice?’… New York Post ‘Unstoppable!’</p>
<p><strong>emory</strong>: Is that all?</p>
<p><strong>klein</strong>: No. The Mayor sent word, that he wants this
thing handled quickly, before anything unfortunate happens. He said he
doesn’t want to be known as the ‘Mayor of the City Where Maurice Parker
Died!’</p>
<p><strong>emory</strong>: Is that all?</p>
<p><strong>klein</strong>: No. Mrs. Matlin’s waiting for you.</p>
<p><strong>adelle</strong>: What happened with the museum sighting?</p>
<p><strong>emory</strong>: False alarm.</p>
<p><strong>emory</strong>: It’s been a long couple of days for all of
us. So let me be honest. If he hasn’t turned up yet, he’s probably –</p>
<p><strong>adelle</strong>: No… No.</p>
<p><strong>emory</strong>: I spoke with Dr. Ray this morning, and he
said it was highly unlikely that someone in his condition could survive
this long without medical attention, let alone walk sixty miles – in
fact his exact word was, ‘Impossible’.</p>
<p><strong>emory</strong>: If I knew where he was, I’d get him off the
street, but I think it’s time that you, the Mayor, and everyone else be
braced for the inevitable.</p>
<p><strong>juan</strong>: Hey, Maurice man – keep going buddy!</p>
<p><strong>overweight woman</strong>: Don’t stop Maurice!</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Go Mr. Parker!</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Thank you God!</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Sweet Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>klein</strong>: They found him.</p>
<p><strong>klein</strong>: Dawson’s on the C.B. – wants to talk with you
Sarg.</p>
<p><strong>emory</strong>: What’s going on? Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: He’s just getting off 280. It’s amazing
Sarg… everybody’s out of their cars and cheering him on.</p>
<p><strong>emory</strong>: Shit, get him in your car and take him to
St. Vincents.</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: You ever see that concert footage of the
Doors, Sarg?</p>
<p><strong>emory</strong>: What the hell are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: The Doors, the musical group. I saw a
documentary where the police stopped one of their concerts, snatched Jim
Morrison right off the stage… the crowd went frickin nuts – they tore up
the place – it turned into a war. … I’m not stopping this concert by
myself. And there’s no way you’re getting backup here – it’s jammed up
for miles.</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Why don’t we just let him finish Sarg?</p>
<p><strong>emory</strong>: How does he look?</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Like shit. He’s bleeding heavily. He’s
having breathing problems and he’s as pale as stone. If he wasn’t
moving, I’d swear he was dead.</p>
<p><strong>emory</strong>: Bring him in. Now! If he dies out there, who
the hell knows what that crowd will do… Let alone the Mayor.</p>
<p><strong>emory</strong>: He’ll be in a hospital within a half an
hour.</p>
<p><strong>tv anchor</strong>: … He’s headed West on Sharp Park Road…
Witnesses describe him as seriously injured.</p>
<p><strong>tv anchor</strong>: Lynn McCay and our Highway Cam – has just
spotted him…</p>
<p><strong>an explosion of yelling, cheering californian’s engulfs
the</strong>: AIR as they spot Maurice standing at the end of the
street. The CROWD SURGES TOWARDS HIM.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: Don’t stop walking.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: The police are here. They’re coming to take
Mr. Parker away. He needs our help.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: Help Mr. Parker! Don’t let them end the
walk.</p>
<p><strong>speaker</strong>: Step aside now! You are ordered to step
aside now!</p>
<p><strong>emory</strong>: What the hell is going on? It’s frickin wall
to wall people and they’re way too emotional. We need mucho backup –
now!… Officers are to bring in Mr. Parker on sight, don’t ask questions,
don’t hesitate, bring him in… I want a barricade placed along the entire
beach area… Now God damn it, now!</p>
<p><strong>emory</strong>: Holy shit.</p>
<p><strong>tv anchor</strong>: … Through ten states and over three
thousand miles…</p>
<p><strong>tv anchor 2</strong>: … A bookstore owner from Philadelphia
Pennsylvania…</p>
<p><strong>radio d.j.</strong>: … Ellen Parker killed by a drunk driver
September 2nd…</p>
<p><strong>tv anchor 3</strong>: … A seven month odyssey through the

<p><strong>ellen</strong>: What do you think heaven is like?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I think it’s a different place for each
person.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Did you have a dream?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I know where my heaven is.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Pacifica, California.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Why there?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: When I was ten, my family lived in Pacifica
for a year. I used to go to the beach everyday that summer. I never felt
so happy, carefree. It was a magic place for me… That’s where my heaven
will be.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Maurice?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: If I die, you’ll know where to look for
me?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Go to sleep Ellen.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: No really, if God takes us away from each
other, you know where to look now?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: The beach of Pacifica, California.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Go to sleep Ellen.</p>
<p><strong>adelle</strong>: Uncle Maurice, please, we have to get you to
a hospital.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: I have to finish first.</p>
<p><strong>adelle</strong>: I won’t let you die.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: Let him finish Adelle. He’s almost there.</p>
<p><strong>adelle</strong>: He’s almost dead. Can’t you see that! This
has nothing to do with you.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: It has nothing to do with you either… This
is between Ellen and me.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: I’m begging you…</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Let me do this for Ellen, let me do this
for my wife.</p>
<p><strong>at that moment the inner circle breaks open as two
officers</strong>: RUSH IN. They reach for Maurice.</p>
<p><strong>adelle</strong>: Touch him, and they’ll be a riot…</p>
<p><strong>adelle</strong>: … and I’ll start it.</p>
<p><strong>gantz</strong>: He’s coming. What should I do?</p>
<p><strong>gantz</strong>: Watch your step Mr. Parker.</p>
