<h1 id="the-boondock-saints">the-boondock-saints</h1>
<p><strong>monsignor</strong>: Thank you Father Macklepenny, for coming
all the way across town to be our guest speaker today. I hope you found
our little parish to your liking.</p>
<p><strong>annabelle macmanus</strong>: They’ve never been like anyone
else. From the moment they were born, of the same womb, on the same day,
they just had their own way, my boys did. And I always knew that one day
they would do something of true greatness. I just never expected they
would bring about such a… such a reckoning.</p>
<p><strong>monsignor</strong>: …and I am reminded of this holy day of
the sad story of Kitty Geneviese. This poor soul cried out time and time
again for help but no person answered her calls. Though many saw, not
one so much as called. Her assailant wiped the bloody knife off on her
lifeless little body. They watched as he simply walked away. Nobody
wanted to get involved. Nobody wanted to take a stand… We must fear evil
men and deal with them accordingly but what we must truly guard against,
what we must fear most Is the indifference of good men.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: I do believe the Monsignor finally got a
point.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Aye.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mcgerkin</strong>: Boys this is Rose, Baum, Gurtle…
Gurtle.</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: Rozengurtle Baumgartner.</p>
<p><strong>mcgerkin</strong>: You’ll be training her today, and do a
good job.</p>
<p><strong>both boys</strong>: Aye.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Pleased ta meet ya Rozie.</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: I prefer to be called Rozengurtle by men.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Okay then… let’s get ya started.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Christ, that’s the largest woman I’ve ever
seen.</p>
<p><strong>mcgerkin</strong>: It’s self-imposed affirmative action. If
we hire big, fat, angry lesbians, then the leftist groups representing
big, fat angry lesbians, won’t think we’re violating their rights.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Well, how politically correct you are.
That’s good stuff.</p>
<p><strong>mcgerkin</strong>: Hey, those people can shut ya down.
They’ll sue you into the ground claiming they were put under mental
duress, inner pain. and sufferin’.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Well, as long as we’re hirin’ fat lesbians,
give your ma a call.</p>
<p><strong>mcgerkin</strong>: Fuck you Murphy.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Okay, just cut off as much fat as you can as
it goes by and the rule of thumb here is…</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: Rule of thumb?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: Do you know where that term comes from? In the
early 1900’s it was legal for men to beat their wives as long as they
used a stick no wider than their thumb.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Can’t do much damage with that. Perhaps, it
shoulda been the rule of wrist. Ha! Rule of wrist.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Hey Murphy?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Aye.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: How many feminists does it take to screw in
a light bulb?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: How many?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Two. One ta screw it in and one ta suck my
cock.</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: I knew you two pricks would give me problems.
Give me shit cause I’m a woman. I’m not gonna take your male dominance
bullshit!</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Yeah. Just tryin’ ta break the ice is
all.</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: Fuck you… …and fuck you!</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Oh, come on its St. Patty’s Day. It’s all in
good fun.</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: Baumgartner sound Irish to you, fuck face?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Now look Rozengurtle, we’re sorry. Just
relax.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Why don’t you save all your aggression for
protests and marches and what not.</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: You fuckin’ slaves. Kowtowing to the needs of
men! Get up! Get the fuck up! Leave him there.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Guess you’ll have ta change that tattoo now,
won’t ya Rozie!?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Connor, is that you?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Mother, is that you?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Is that worthless brother of your there? I want
you both ta hear this.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Ma, what’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: No fuckin’ hot water man. That…</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Shut it. It’s Ma.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: It’s all your fault. Both you little bastards.
I was a fool to believe you would bring me any peace. The day your Da
left us when you were almost too young to remember, he said the two of
you would do me right and make me proud, but he was wrong and I got
nothin’ ta live for.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Mother, what are you sayin’? You’re talkin’
crazy here.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: What’s the matter with her?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: I finally found your Da’s army revolver,
Connor.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: What the hell are you doin’ with Da’s
gun!?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: What the…?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: I got it ta my head now. I got it ta my head
now.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: What?! What are you doin’?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: I want ta tell ya one last thing before I pull
the trigger.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Pull the trigger?! Have ya lost it woman?!
Now just calm down here.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Oh my god!</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: No ma! No!</p>
<p><strong>connor &amp; murphy</strong>: Oh Jesus, No! No! Oh God! No
Ma!</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Aaaww, shit!… evil woman!</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Lord have mercy. That was a good one ma.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Oh, Jesus! No ma! Christ ma! No!</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Oh, she’s quite proud of herself.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Okay, seriously, both you listen ta me now.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: All right, we’re both here.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: It’s only 11:00 here boys so I got lot’s more
drinkin’ ta do with your worthless relatives down at the Anvil.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Just called ta torture us did ya?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: How’s Uncle Sibeal?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Well, you know how it is with him. Always
complainin’ he’s never turnin’ a profit on St. Patty’s. Whole damn
family goes down there with no money, cause we know he can’t bear ta
charge us.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: But he’s been havin’ himself a nip or two as
well… Been up the waitress’ skirt all night, poor girl.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Well you tell him ta take it easy with that.
He’s gotta learn ta respect women the way Connor does.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Oh, Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: I gave him his first lesson in sensitivity
toward the fairer sex just today.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Don’t even do it, ya bastard.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: He got beat up by a girl.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: If that was a girl I want ta see some
papers. She had ta be just preoperative for Christ sakes.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Lord’s name.</p>
<p><strong>both</strong>: Mother Mary, full of grace.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: What did you do, Connor?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Well, we tried ta make friends and she gave
me a shot ta the nuts.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: What… the dirty bitch! I hope ya trounced her a
good one!</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Well, I didn’t but…</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Don’t worry, I respected the hell out of her
for ya, Ma.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Well listen, I know how my boys take ta
scrappin’ when they take ta drinkin’.</p>
<p><strong>both</strong>: Yes mother.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: I mean it now. I carried the two of you little
bastards around in my belly at the same time you ungrateful pissants. Ya
ruined my girlish figure in one fell swoop, and then ya sucked me dry.
My tits are saggin’ down ta my ankles. I trip over em for Christ sakes,
now ya listen ta me, NO FIGHTEN!</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Promise me boys.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: We promise.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Yeah, we promise.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Well, there’s my boys. Shit. I gotta go. Looks
like I caused a ruckus with that shot. Half the damn neighborhood is
comin’.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: All right, love ya ma. Listen, before ya go
just give us the goods, eh?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Yeah. It’s been twenty-seven years.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Still bickerin’ over that, huh?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Come on, ma. Out with it. Who came out
first?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: All right, I suppose you have the right ta
know.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Are ya ready?</p>
<p><strong>both</strong>: Aye.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: The one with the biggest cock!</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Crazy woman.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Don’t start. I’ve had ice on mine.</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: …so these guys are just kickin’ the shit
out of each other. This guy Picks up an old kitchen sink that some one
threw out and crushes this guy With it. All right, so it makes a big
bang and alerts their friend, who’s standin’ look out around the corner.
So he comes over and gets into it with this guy, He’s angry at him,
right? They get into an altercation in which the look out guy crushes
this guy by jumpin on him. And look at the damage here. I mean this
guy’s fuckin’ hamburger man. His spine is crushed. He’s all twisted and
shit. That guy had to be one big mother fucker. Huge, 3-400 pounds,
fuckin huge.</p>
<p><strong>greely</strong>: Or, okay. Check this out. Say these two
don’t even know the huge guy. They’re just staggerin’ home from a bar
this morning, still all fucked up from St. Patty’s last night. So they
figure they’ll take a short cut down the alley and this big mother
fucker, he’s just waitin’. And what could be more perfect for strong arm
robbery? Two drunk guys all bandaged up. They’re already injured for
Christ sakes. He takes a blunt object and whacks the guy with the
bandage on his head, right? Cause he’s smart. He knows the guy with the
bandage on his ass, he ain’t going nowhere. Matter of fact, this guy’s
probably helping his friend with the rectal problem along. They’re
limping around like a couple of decrepit old broads. So once this guy’s
out of the picture this poor asshole, he tries to run. But look how far
he gets fore the huge bastard catches up with him. Only a few yards. And
what does he do? He gets creative. He picks up a sink and crushes the
poor mother- fucker. Then, he ain’t done yet. He comes over here, jumps
on this guy’s back and crushes him to death. He steals their shit and
beats it! Thanks for comin’ out! And look at this print…</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: That’s one big fuckin’ shoe!… and think
about it. Of all the ways to kill a guy, crushin’ him to death. That’s
very particular. You don’t get many of those. I dunno. I feel something
big here. I wouldn’t be surprised if we see more of these turning
up.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Brilliant. So now we got a Huge guy theory
and Serial crusher theory. Top fucking notch. What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: Detective Greenly. Who the fuck are
you?</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: That’s who the fuck I am.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Listen, I gotta go by the numbers on this
one. I.D. just came back on these guys. They’ve got connections to the
Russian mob. That makes it a federal matter and Agent Smecker, here, is
heading up the investigation with our full cooperation.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Why don’t you get me a cup of coffee.</p>
<p><strong>greeny</strong>: What the fuck?</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Caf� latte.</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: Who the…</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Twist of lemon!</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: Chief, what the fuck is this?</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Sweet-n-low!</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Mitchell, Langley!</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Find the manager of this building. See if
he has had any complaints of water coming down in any apartments,
starting just this morning. If he’s not there, knock on every door
starting from the third floor up. Langley, you take this building, same
thing.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Chaffey, Newman.</p>
<p><strong>chaffey</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Look in the trash around their hands. See
if you can find me two bullet casings. 45’s, if my eye serves me right.
Don’t disturb them. Mark them as they lay. Newman, root through this
shit. If this was a sink find me some metal parts. Gimme a faucet or a
drain cover or something.</p>
<p><strong>chaffey</strong>: Got it. It’s a 45.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Chief, could you get ballistics down here
and tell them they have to dig a 45 slug out of a brick wall.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: …and locate another that’s been fired
through a dumpster.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: I got the best ballistics guy in the world.
He’s mobile. Got all his stuff right in the van. Can have him down here
in 10 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>dolly</strong>: How did you know that?</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Paraffin came up positive. And bullet holes
are usually a big clue.</p>
<p><strong>chaffey</strong>: I can’t find the second one, sir.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Look under the body.</p>
<p><strong>chaffey</strong>: Got it.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: You guy’s ready for this?</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: This was no gangland assassination. Though
creative, it was way too sloppy. Something went wrong here. This has
personal written all over it. Now, these men were crushed and the first
natural reaction the body has to such trauma is to tense up. So now the
two shots fired here were reflex rounds. These guys weren’t shooting at
anything, but they were just about to.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Agent Smecker, This is all illegal loft
housing so there’s no manager on the premises but I found a lady on the
fourth floor said she’s had water dripping down on her whole place.
Started just this morning.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Fourth floor huh? Then we’re heading to the
fifth. Let’s go up and see just how right I am.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: So what are you thinkin’ here?</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Really want to know?</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: No way. You know how big a guy’s gotta be
to do that? Fuckin’ huge.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Oooo. I might be wanting a bagel with my
coffee.</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: I ain’t getting him no fuckin’ bagel.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: We’ll start the ass kissing with you.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Agent Smecker. I know this neighborhood
pretty good. There’s a bar called McGinty’s down the block. It’s a good
bet they were there last night.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Good work, Mitchell. I’ll check that out
myself.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Hey, Duffy. What the fuck happened here?
You owe me. This is the one I want.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: Let’s go get a cup of coffee. You ain’t gonna
fuckin’ believe this one.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: I want A.P.B.’s put out. I want more
uniforms on the streets. One thing’s for sure, wherever these guys are
they’re hurting.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Okay. Just calm down. Take it easy. He’ll
have his day. He’ll have his</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Thanks for comin’, Doc.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: J-Jesus. What the fuck happened? Are ya b-boys
all right?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: We’re alive.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: An F.B.I. agent came by the bar. He left me his
c-c, he left me his c-c, he left me this.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Fuck!……….Ass!</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: We’re going to turn ourselves in. It was
self defense.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: y-y-yeah that’s what he said.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: How the fuck’s he know that? We haven’t
spoken to anyone yet.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Don’t know. He didn’t say.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Listen Doc, we need a favor.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: A-anything.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Hold this shit for us, Doc. We’ll be comin
back for it when we get out.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: First of all, I’d like to thank whichever
one of you donut munching, barrel-assed dip-shits leaked this to the
press. That’s just what we need now, some sensational story in the
papers making these guys out to be super heroes, triumphing over evil.
And let me squash the rumors now. These two aren’t heroes. They are two
ordinary men who were put in an extraordinary situation and they just
happened to come out on top. Yes, nothing from our far reaching computer
system has turned up jack shit on these two. All we know is what we
found out from their neighbors. And the general consensus is that
they’re… angels. But angels don’t kill and we got two bodies in the
morgue that look like they’ve been…</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: …serial crushed by a huge fuckin’ guy.</p>
<p><strong>chaffey</strong>: Are these me considered armed and
dangerous?</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Well, not armed. If they had guns, they’d
have used them. But dangerous? Oh yeah.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: What makes you think they’re dangerous?
They were just protecting each other.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Look, look! I’m not saying one way or the
other. Just be careful and go by the protocol on this one.</p>
<p><strong>chaffey</strong>: Any tips on where these guys may be?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: No help at all. Swamped from St. Patty’s.
Packed with drunk, bloody Irish.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Just hit the bricks nice and hard.</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: These guys are miles away by now.</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: But if you want to beat your head against a
wall, then here’s what you look for. These guys are scared like two
little bunny rabbits. Anything in a uniform or flashing blue lights will
spook them. So the only thing we can do is put a potato on a string and
drag it through South Boston.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: You’d probably have better luck with a
beer.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: What the fuck is this!? This isn’t a
fuckin’ tea party. Get out! Only thing I want in here is them.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: This conversation is going to be recorded.
Just answer to the best of your knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Excuse me, sir.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: “What do we tell him about the guns and
money?”</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: “We just got up and left. Bum musta rolled
them before the police got there.”</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Okay. We’re ready.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: You guys are not under oath, here. I am
assuming you knew these two guys from before, huh?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: We… met them last night.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: They had some pretty interesting bandages.
Know anything about that?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Would someone please come over here and…</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Fuck!</p>

<p><strong>rocco</strong>: …It’s not that I’m homophobic. I’m just
afraid of faggots.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I got some bad news. Looks like I’m gonna have
ta close d-down the bar. The Russians have been buying up buildings all
over town, including this one… Fuck!… Ass! And they’re not letting me
renew my lease. I got ’til the end of the week to come up with 26,000
dollars, or they take the place. I left them a note telling them not to
show their faces t- tonight. They been pressuring me ta close and take
the last few days ta get all my shit outta here but it’s my right to
stay open ta the last.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Let me talk to my boss, may I can…</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: L-l-listen I don’t want anyone ta know until
the last possible moment. So you guys keep your traps shut. ya know what
they say; People in glass houses sink ships.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Y’know Doc, I gotta get you a, a, like a
proverb book or something. This mix and match shit’s gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: A p-penny saved is worth two in the
bush.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Don’t c-cross the road if ya can’t get out
of the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>checkov</strong>: I am Ivan Checkov. You will be closing
now.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: This is McCoy… we find Spock and we got
enough for an away team.</p>
<p><strong>checkov</strong>: Oh, how extraordinary. A bunch of Irishmen…
and they are being drunken idiots. You are killing the stereotype. I’m
in no mood for discussion. You! You stay. The rest of you go now.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Why don’t you make like a tree and get the fuck
outta here!</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Calm down, Doc. I’m sure they’re reasonable
fellows.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Listen fellas, Y’know he’s got ’til this
week’s end. Ya don’t have ta be hard asses, do ya?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Yeah, it’s St. Patty’s day. Everyone’s Irish
tonight. Now, why don’t ya pull up a stool and have a drink with us?</p>
<p><strong>checkov</strong>: You insult me. I would never drink that
sewage. Especially with you people. You are fools.</p>
<p><strong>checkov</strong>: This is no game! If you won’t go, we will
make you go!</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: If ya want a fight, you can see you’re
outnumbered. We’re trying ta be civil here, so I suggest you take our
offer.</p>
<p><strong>checkov</strong>: I make the offers, ass-hole.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Hey, there Boris. What would you say if I
told you that your pinko, commie mother sucked so much dick…</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: “Now, that wasn’t too polite, was it?”</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: “I’m afraid we can’t let that one go,
Ivan.”</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: I don’t think Ma would mind.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Let the boy go. He knows what the fuck he’s
doing!</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Nicely done, boy!</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Now, like my fine brother says, on
St. Patty’s everyone’s Irish. And this piece of shit is about to be
initiated.</p>
<p><strong>friend #1</strong>: Are ya tryin’ ta kill him, ya fuck?</p>
<p><strong>checkov</strong>: I was going to kill you. But I’m not… I’m
going to kill your brother. I’m going to take him down to the dumpster
and I’m going to shoot him in the head. Then I’m going to throw his dead
body in the garbage. Trash guys are coming in 10 minutes, gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: It was just a bar fight. You guys are
fuckin’ pussies!</p>
<p><strong>checkov</strong>: I hope your conscience is clear,
Irishman.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: We paid attention in school.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Know any other languages?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Aye. Our mother insisted on it. French.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: How do you think he figured all this out
without talking to us?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Italian.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: I have no idea. Maybe someone saw and
talked.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: German. Not in our neighborhood, man. A
hundred percent Irish. No one talks to cops. Period.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Spanish. Then I guess he’s just real… real
good.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: What are you guys doing working at a
fucking meat packing plant?</p>
<p><strong>chaffey</strong>: Ah, Agent Smecker, we have a problem.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>chaffey</strong>: The press is everywhere outside. They’re
going nuts for these guys. What do you want to do?</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: You’re not being charged. It’s up to you.
Do you want to talk to them?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Absolutely not.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: No pictures, either.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Well, we could try the bag over the head
thing. Walk you right out the front.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Our mother can see through bags.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Aye, she can. Any way we can stay here?</p>
<p><strong>chaffey</strong>: Sure, we have an empty holding cell, They
can… can they stay?</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Well, we’ll have to check with your mother,
but it’s ok with me if your friends sleep over.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Time to feed the dogs.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: He’s a nice guy.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Yes… he is.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: This is our official statement. The MacManus
brothers are not being charged with a crime. It was a clean- cut case of
self defense. We have thanked them for their cooperation and we thank
you, the media, for your tireless pursuit of the truth.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Destroy all that which is evil…</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: …so that which is good may flourish</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Be right back…</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: We would be honored, sir, if you would join
us peasants, in a donut.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Saints? I will not accept this pizzle until
my feet have been properly anointed.</p>
<p><strong>vincenzo</strong>: Well, it’s the funny man. Give it here,
package boy.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Joey Bevo said it was important. Said I had
to give it to him myself.</p>
<p><strong>vincenzo</strong>: Gimme the fuckin’ thing. Now sit the fuck
down!</p>
<p><strong>vincenzo</strong>: I’m Rocco. I’m the funny man. Heee Hee.
I’m so fuckin’ funny. Hee Hee.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Fuck you Vincenzo.</p>
<p><strong>vincenzo</strong>: Tell me a joke funny man. Hee Hee.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: I caught your show down at the velvet room at
the Holiday Inn, loved it when you busted into Viva Las Vegas.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Hey, hey, hey…</p>
<p><strong>yakavetta</strong>: Fuck you! I could snap my fingers and
have you dead in four hours, rotting in a truck off of Boyleston! You
insignificant little fuck! I always get my fuckin’ money!</p>
<p><strong>yakavetta</strong>: Fuckin’ 90’s are killin’ me. I shouldn’t
a done that. You’re not supposed to tell a guy you’re gonna kill him
anymore. I gotta tip-toe through the tulips with these assholes. I
prance. I’m a prancer. It’s what I do… sucked all the fun right out of
this job.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Poppa Joe, you want me to go now?</p>
<p><strong>yakavetta</strong>: Yeah. Thanks, Rocco. See ya.</p>
<p><strong>yakavetta</strong>: Hey, Rocco, wait. Come back here.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Yeah boss?</p>
<p><strong>yakavetta</strong>: I always see you talking to the boys and
making them laugh. They always come around telling me what a crack up
you are. What is it they call you?</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: The… The funny man.</p>
<p><strong>yakavetta</strong>: The funny man. Well, I got a new job for
you, just for now. Roc, I’m having a real shitty day. I’m depressed.
Tell me a funny story or a joke.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Uh. Okay… um… you hear the one about the, no
fuck that one… uh… oh! oh! Well… shit. Okay, there’s a white guy. He’s
walkin’ along the beach and he finds a, a pot, y’know and ah, he rubs it
and this genie pops out. But this genie, he’s a ni… he’s a black
guy.</p>
<p><strong>yakavetta</strong>: He’s a nigger.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Yeah. And uh, he’s pissed off. He says, “Why
you crackers always gotta find my mother fuckin’ pot? And he tells him
he’s gonna grant all his three wishes but he’s gonna give all the black
guys…</p>
<p><strong>vincenzo and yakavetta</strong>: Niggers!</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Sorry! Sorry! All the niggers on the planet
get double what he wishes for. “I’ll take a million dollars,” he says.
Genie give it to him and says every nigger on earth just got two
million. “I don’t care gimme a yacht.” Poof there it is. E-every bl…
every nigger just got two yachts. Genie goes… I’m sorry Poppa Joe. I
can’t. This joke sucks.</p>
<p><strong>yakavetta</strong>: Continue the joke.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: He says, “What’s your third wish?” And the
guys says, “I-I want you to beat me half to death.”</p>
<p><strong>yakavetta</strong>: Very good stuff, Rocco. Very good stuff.
Tell me another one.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Know what we need, man?… some rope.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Charlie Bronson’s always got rope.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Yeah, these guys always got a lot of rope
strapped around em in the movies and they always end up using it.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Oh, you’ve lost it, haven’t ya?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: I’m serious.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Me too. That’s stupid. Name one thing we’re
gonna need it for.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: I don’t know they just always need it.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: What is all this “they” shit? This ain’t a
movie.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Is that right, Rambo?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: All right, get the stupid fuckin’ rope.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Uh,huh. Room number.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: We got a time of death?</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: What’s the body count?</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Uh, huh.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: I’ll be down there in a bit. Keep the press
out.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>reuben</strong>: I was just trying to cuddle.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Cuddle?… What a fag!</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: He’s struck again, hasn’t he, Greenly?</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: Why do you always disrespect me like
that?</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Respect is earned, Greenly, never given.
Guys like you should have to follow me around squabbling for the scraps
from my table.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: How many bodies, Greenly?</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: Eight.</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: No! Shit! I didn’t see that one. Nine!
Nine!</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: While Greenly’s getting coffee, anybody
else want anything?</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: Shit! Shit!</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: So Duffy, got any theories to go with that…
tie.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: These guys were pros. I think they were
coming for one target, the fag man, he was the…</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: The what man?</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: The fat man.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Well, Freud was right. So you think they
came for the fag man, huh? And what do you base this upon?</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: He was the only one done right. Two in the
back of the head.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: And the pennies?</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: New hitman wants to leave his mark</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: That’s a possibility. Y’know you Boston
cops are perking up. That’s two sound theories in one day, neither of
which deal with abnormally sized men. Another possibility is that they
were placed there with religious intent.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: Yeah. Some cultures still put pennies in the
eyes of the dead, or silver.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: The Greeks. The Italians.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: The Sicilians.</p>
<p><strong>dolly</strong>: What’s the symbology there?</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Symbology? Well, now that Duffy has
relinquished his King Bone Head crown I see we have an heir to the
throne. I’m sure the word you were looking for was symbolism. What’s the
symbolism there? Let me explain it to you. In Greek and Roman mythology
when you died you would have to pay the toll to Charon, the boatman who
ferried you across to the gates of judgment. This made sure the dead
came to atone for what they did during their lives, Detective…</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Dollapoppaskalious.</p>
<p><strong>dolly</strong>: Holy shit. You’re the first one that’s ever
got that.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Yeah, well… I’m an expert in name-
ology.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: I’ve seen burns like these before. They
used silencers. Look at these entry and exit wounds. They’re
identical.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: The two bullets went in here, through the
top of the skull, criss-crossed and exited through the eyeballs. This
one clue tells us three distinct facts. Number one… Duffy.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: They shot him at a downward angle. They put
him on his knees.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Excellent! Number two. Greenly.</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: Uh. Shit, I, uh…</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: It tells us that he was the last to die.
All these men Were carrying. They came in, dropped all in seconds and
then took their time with fag man. Didn’t they, Duffy?! They sure as
fuck did!</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: And number three, Dolly.</p>
<p><strong>dolly</strong>: Uh… two shooters!</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Fan-fuckin-tastic!</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Now stay with me, boys. What did they do to
make two such identical wounds? Did one guy put him on his knees, pop a
cap in, sit him back up and shoot him again the same way? No. Two men of
similar height dropped this guy down, each put some iron to his head and
boom! That’s all she fuckin’ wrote!</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: What about one guy with two guns?</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Possible, but unlikely. The angles are too
extreme. A guy holding two guns to the back of your head is gonna shoot
straight ahead. He wouldn’t cock out his elbows, makes no sense.
Besides, you telling me one guy came in here and killed eight men with
eight extremely well aimed shots in just a few seconds? No way. Had to
be at least two.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Television,… television is the explanation
for this.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: You see this is bad television. The little
assault guys creeping in through the vents and coming in through the
ceilings. That James Bond shit never happens in real life. Professionals
don’t do that. So we’ve got this up here, which has novice written all
over it. And all this down here that’s simply a perfect textbook
assassination. So here’s our two possibilities. We either have rank
amateurs that got lucky or consummate professionals that fucked up.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Join me in a drink, gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: With the exception of my coffee boy, you
Boston detectives are starting to show signs of intelligence. So, I am
going to make you privy to some information that you would not normally
be. These men are all Russian mob. Not like those two peons in the alley
the other day. These guys are all syndicate bosses and underbosses. I
have a dossier on every man in this room. Since the Iron Curtain has
gone down, the Russian syndicates have started to come here. And in the
spirit of Glasnost the Soviets have opened their borders to the mafia.
But the Italians, they’re not convinced that the grounds in mother
Russia are fertile enough for organized crime yet. So they ain’t ready
to commit. The Russians are coming here anyway. They are unwelcome. What
we have here, gentlemen, is possibly the beginning of the first
international mob war… unless I’ve totally missed something.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Now, what is this going to look like to
those who do not know what I just told you?</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: It’s gonna look like the bad guys are killing
each other.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: And is there an American, shit is there a
man seated among us that hasn’t thought about it many times, let’s just
put them all on an island, give them guns and let them kill each other.
This is our wet dream come true. You can expect federal and local law
enforcement to go only deep enough to satisfy the law, then bury it from
here on out.</p>
<p><strong>dolly</strong>: So, what do we do now?</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: That depends. You either do your job or get
ethical.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: This better be good. Talk!</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Nervous?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: A bit.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Me, too.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: You and your fucking rope.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: See. I told you there’d be a shaft.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Just like on TV.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Where the fuck are you going?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: We’ll find it. Just calm down.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: No, fuck you. This rope is bullshit. I’m
sweatin’ my ass off draggin’ this stupid thing around. Must weigh 30
pounds.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: We’re doing some serious shit here. Now, get
a hold of yourself, asshole.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Asshole!? I’m not the rope-totin’ Charlie
Bronson wanna-be that’s getting’ us lost!</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Sh, sh! Fuck you!</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: No, fuck you!</p>
<p><strong>both</strong>: And shepherds we shall be. For thee, my Lord,
for thee. Power hath descended forth from thy hand that our feet may
swiftly carry out thy command. So we shall flow a river forth to thee
and teeming with souls shall it ever be. E nomini patri, et Fili e
spiritu sancti.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: That was some good fuckin’ rope.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: That was way easier than I thought.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Aye.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: On TV ya always get that asshole that jumps
behind the couch.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Yeah, and ya gotta shoot at him for ten
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Oh, we’re good man.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Yes, we are.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: I love our new job.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Oh, God! Don’t kill me! We’re on the same
side! The boss musta sent you in as back up, huh? Oh, shit, please! I’m
Rocco. I’m the funny man. They call me the funny fuckin’ man!</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Where’s your gun?</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Chest pocket. Shit!</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: This is a six-shooter.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Nine bodies.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Oh, you’re good. What were you gonna do?
Laugh the last three to death, funny man?</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Poppa Joe said there was only two. In and
out. Boy, you guys sure did a good job. You’re good, huh? Cool masks.
Where’d you get them?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Let’s do him right here.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Right now.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Don’t kill me. Oh shit, please no. I’m Rocco.
I’m the funny man!… the funny man… the funny.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: What did you do?! Fuckin’… what the fuckin’
fuck! Who the fuck, fucked this fuckin’? fuck. How did you two fuckin’,
fucks?……… FUCK!!!</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Certainly illustrates the diversity of the
word.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: What the fuck are you doing here? What, huh!?
WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? ANSWERS!</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Get a hold of yourself, man.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Yeah, get a hold of yourself.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Listen, we gotta get outta here now. We’ll
take separate exits and meet at Rocco’s.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Fuck!</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Anybody you think is evil?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Don’t you think that’s a little psycho? A
little weird?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Weird, huh?… Know what I think is weird?
Decent men with loving families go home every day after work. They turn
on the news and see rapists, murderers, and child molesters all getting
out of prison.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Mafiosos getting caught with 20 kilos and
walkin’ on bail the same day.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Little girls catchin’ stray bullets in their
heads, playin’ hopscotch in their front yards. And everyone thinks the
same thing… Someone should just go kill those motherfuckers.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Kill em all. Admit it, even you’ve thought
about it.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: You guys should be in every major city.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: This is some heavy shit. This is like Lone
Ranger-heavy man. Fuck it! There’s so much shit that pisses me off. You
guys should recruit ‘cause I am sick and fuckin’ tired of walkin’ down
the street waitin’ for one of these assholes to get me, y’know?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Hallelujah, Jaffar.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: So you’re not just talkin’ mob guys. You’re
talkin’ anyone, right? Even like pimps and drug dealers and all that
shit?</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Well fuck, you guys could do this every
day.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: We’re like 7-Eleven. We ain’t always doing
business, but we’re always open.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Nicely put.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: You fuckin’ guys. You ruined me. I’m fuckin’
done. Permanent package boy.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Who says that? You could take credit on
it.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: What are you serious?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Yeah, fuck it. If you think about it, it’s
all you can do really. You can’t tell him it was us. Go in braggin’ and
shit.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Climb the corporate ladder, boy. Don
Rocco.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Fuck it! I’m doing it. I deserve it. I’ve
been working for those fat bastards since I was in high school and look
at this place.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: They’re fuckin’ me man! Hey, they can suck my
pathetic little dick. And I’ll dip my nuts in marinara just so the fat
fucks can get a taste of home while they’re at it. That’s it, it’s done,
I’m doing it.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: I can’t fuckin’ believe that just
happened!</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Donna’s gonna be angry about her cat.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Shit. She’s on every drug know to man. She’d
have sold that thing for a dime bag. Screw her. But I do kinda feel like
an ass-hole.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: You sound real remorseful.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: She ain’t been around in weeks anyhow.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Listen. Something’s been bothering me about
last night.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Well… what if your boss knew how many guys
were supposed to be there… in that room?</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: What are you saying?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Think about it man. Nine men, six
bullets.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: You think they sold me out? No way.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: He probably knew you’d end up nailing the
fat guy, maybe one or two more, but he had to know you weren’t walking
out of there. Figure it out. Shooter’s dead on the scene. No in-depth
investigation. It’d slide right off his back. ’Cause as much as I love
ya, you’re not exactly Don Corleone. What would he be losing? A thirty-
five year old delivery boy?</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: No, no. That’s just not the way things are
done. Besides, how’s he know I don’t just get in there see there’s too
many and just serve em their fuckin’ food and beat it?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: He knows you, man. He knows all you want is
to move up. That’s all. A smooth hitter woulda gone in there, seen it
was a wash and slipped out. But a guy like you? Knowin’ this is your
only chance? Waitin’ eighteen years?</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: No. No man. That’s… that’s… you don’t know
what you’re talking about. That’s bullshit. I know these guys. I mean,
thanks for your concern, but that just ain’t the thing of it.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Do me a favor and roll it around for a bit
on your way in.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: No, look. No rolling. Nothing needs to be
rolled.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Where are you goin’? Did you tell him?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Then what the fuck?</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Hey. You don’t know that shit for sure.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Oh, Jesus. You’re such a fuckin’ retard!</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Fuck you!</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Use your brain for once. Is it so
unbelievable they don’t care about you? You are fuckin’ dead, you go in
there today. Dead!</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Oh yeah. You two fuckin’ Micks know what’s
going on, huh? Fuck you!</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Hey, this ain’t a thing you should gamble
on, Roc.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Fuck it! What kind of flowers ya want at
your funeral? Ya dumb Wop. This is the last time I’ll see you. Bye-bye
ya stupid son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: I’ll be back at 9:00.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Hey. You get in there and start getting a
bad vibe, get the fuck out quick.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Hey Murph.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Roc. You okay?</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Yeah. Anybody call for me?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: No. You sure you’re okay?</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: I’m fuckin’ fine. Catch you on the flip
side.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Here kitty, kitty…… kitty.</p>
<p><strong>dolly</strong>: She was in here when it went down.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Can she I.D. them?</p>
<p><strong>dolly</strong>: They were wearing masks.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Of course they were. How many?</p>
<p><strong>dolly</strong>: Three.</p>
<p><strong>dolly</strong>: Only two did the shooting. So what are you
thinking, Russian retaliation?</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Nah, too quick half their infrastructure
got taken out at the Copley plaza. Besides, if you’re a hitter, you’re
either working for the Russians or the Italians. There’s no riding the
fence. Our little theory from last night just got blown to shit.
Something… new is going on here.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Probably shouldn’t work another shift for
awhile.</p>
<p><strong>dancer</strong>: Fuck this job. I’m getting out of the porno
business and I don’t care who I gotta blow to do it.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: After talking to the dancer we know that
their mark was the guy in the middle booth. After she watches them whack
him, she passes out. Why the two extra victims?</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: Witness?</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: No way they could have seen it.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Allow me to enlighten you gentlemen to the
protocol of the porno industry, as I’m sure you’ve never been in one of
these places before. A man goes into the booth, puts the money in the
slot. The dancer gets it on the other side. She hits the button, door
goes up, now there is only glass between you and it’s little fireman
time.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: No way they could have seen it?</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Those doors were down… which means this.
They looked down in through the peep hole, saw these guys and opened the
doors from the inside. Pop, pop, pop, right through the glass. Why?</p>
<p><strong>dolly</strong>: Maybe the three of them had something in
common.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: No. This guy is big time. These two are
street-walking scum.</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: Then that’s what they had in common. They
were all bad guys… now they’re all dead bad guys.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: We got another thing to think about here.
We got us a genuine Kennedy assassination style bullet theory. Two guns
were used here, guns A and B. The guy in the middle was done with both.
But this guy… …he was killed with bullets from gun A only. And this guy…
…gun B only. But ballistics dug two slugs out of the wall from over here
where the victim was done with</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: And it’s the same story over here. Why the
crossover? Theories.</p>
<p><strong>dolly</strong>: That’s just fucking weird. I have no
idea.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: Jesus. I just can’t think anymore. That scene
over at the coffee shop today tapped me out.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: A guy went nuts over off of Commonwealth
today. Shot three guys to death in a coffee shop in broad daylight. Fled
the scene. Don’t have much on him.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Why was I not informed of this?</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: They weren’t related. The guy used a 38. No
pennies. Totally amateur.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Who were the victims?</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: A couple of peons for the mob and…</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Oh that’s just BEAUTIFUL! All the scumbags
in the quiet city of Boston start dropping dead and you think it’s
unrelated?! Greenly, the day I want the Boston Police doing my thinking
for me, I will have a fucking tag on my toe! Now, get me a squad car and
get me over there. I want the crime scene photos and any witness
statements. NOW!</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Oh… it looks like we got us a cowboy.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: The shooter knew these guys, huh?</p>
<p><strong>dolly</strong>: How do you figure?</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Friends, Gentlemen. They were friends.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: These guys were packing. Not one hand near
a gun. It’s simple human behavior. Someone you don’t know approaches
you, you put your hand on it. This guy’s got his hands on the table.
He’s eating his food, for Christ sakes. They were friends.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: These two fucking scenes are related. Too
many coincidences. Same day? Five hours apart? Dead mobsters on both
scenes. Now, why did he kill the bartender?</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: Crime of passion. He just went nuts. He would
have shot everyone in here. He just ran out of bullets.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Duffy. This look like a fucking post office
to you? This guy came in here with intent. Maybe he didn’t know exactly
what he was gonna do but he had a pretty good idea. The bartender wasn’t
a fucking accident.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: Well, we didn’t get any help on that. A lot
of people saw it. Nobody’s talking.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Fucking figures. Look, are you guys seeing
the pattern here? We got big questions at both of these crime scenes,
with no answers. WHY did they kill the guys in the other two booths? WHY
did he do the bartender? It would seem unnecessary, even stupid. God, I
hate cold crime scenes! I’m fucking leaving now. And do me a favor, tell
me when the next guy dies, cause these guys are not done yet.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Hey, Murph.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Roc. You okay?</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Yeah. Anybody call for me?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: No. You sure you’re okay?</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: I’m fuckin’ fine. Catch you on the flip
side.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Pack your shit! We gotta get outta here! We
gotta get out!</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: I killed em! Oh, Jesus! I killed em all!!</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Rocco?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Hey, hey. Just calm down. Tell us what
happened!</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: No! Fuck you! You start getting excited! We
gotta fucking go!</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Rocco!</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Who did you kill?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Holy shit. Who? How many?</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Hurry the fuck up!</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: This is some crazy shit, man!</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Those cocksuckers sold me out!</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Did I fuckin’ tell ya, Rocco? They pull on
you first?</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: What did I fuckin’ do?… in the middle of the
Lakeview.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Lakeview the deli? Oh, shit!</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Ha! Ha! Roc, you got a jumbo set of coconut
balls man!</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Where’s my cat?</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: I killed your fuckin’ cat, you druggie
bitch!</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: You… oh god, why?</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: I felt it would bring closure to our
relationship!</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: You killed my… my…</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Your what?! Your fuckin’ what?!</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: My, my…</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Your what, bitch? I’ll shoot myself in the
head, you can tell me that cats name! Go ahead… Your what? Your precious
little…</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Pee…Per…Man.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Peeperman? WRONG? What color was it?!!!</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: It was… It was…</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Male or female, bitch?!!</p>
<p><strong>rayvie</strong>: Don’t you yell at her you fuckin’ prick!</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Shut your fat ass, Rayvie! I can’t buy a pack
of smokes without running into nine guys you fucked.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Don’t you yell at her!</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: All right, let’s get the fuck outta here!</p>
<p><strong>rayvie</strong>: Is my… I mean it’s not really…?</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: No. No. It’s not fat.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Those rat fucks! All of them were all
laughing at me man!</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: You sure you killed them?</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Fuckin-A-right I did. I had a goddam turkey
shoot over there.</p>
<p><strong>vinnie</strong>: I’ll bet it was a test. Vincenzo came in
here shooting his mouth off. He was makin’ sure we knew. But we did what
we were supposed to, eh? We kept our mouths shut. You did your part.
They know we’re goodfellas now. We’ll get taken care of.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: What? Did everyone know? Next thing you’ll
tell me Sal was in on it.</p>
<p><strong>oly</strong>: Fuck. Vincenzo told Sal first. That fat fuck
knew before we did.</p>
<p><strong>oly</strong>: At least we got our funny man back.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Anybody see ya?</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Fuck, man! I may as well have posted flyers.
Right out in public, man.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Liberating isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Y’know it is, a bit.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Stop the car!</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Vincenzo, that fat motherfucker, Yakavetta’s
right hand. He’s the one who set me up. Then he went around shooting his
mouth off, telling everyone I was as good as dead. He goes in there
every Wednesday night around 10:00, he jerks off in the same booth to
the same titty dancer. Never misses.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: So let’s kill the motherfucker. I mean, what
are you guys… like that’s your new thing right?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Yeah, well…</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Oh, what the fuck? How do you guys decide who
you’re… I mean, who makes the cut? Is there a raffle or something?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Well, truth be known, those first ones just
kinda fell into our laps.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Well, what’ya do?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: I guess we really don’t have a system of
deciding who.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: MEEE! ME! I’m the guy! I know everyone, their
habits, where they hang out, who they talk to. I know where they fuckin’
live. We could kill everyone!</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: So what do you think?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: I’m strangely comfortable with it.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Okay Roc, this is…</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: What? You guys got masks.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: You look like Mush Mouth from Fat
Albert.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Fine! Fuck it! When we’re done she can I.D.
me. I don’t care. Just tryin’ to be professional, but no…</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: No. No. It looks good. C’mon, put it back
on. It’s good.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Okay Roc. You sure you’re O-B-kay-B?</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Which one is he in?</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: What’s his routine?</p>
<p><strong>dancer</strong>: H… h… he jerks off in there. Th… then he
puts money through the slot and I raise the door.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Then what?</p>
<p><strong>dancer</strong>: He watches me do my thing and f- finishes
himself off.</p>
<p><strong>vincenzo</strong>: Don’t you talk to me like that, you dirty
little… give it to daddy… give it ta da King… garbage mouth, garbage
mouth.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Oh man. He is some sicko.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: You’ve earned this.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: What the fuck are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: I-I’ll tip her.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: We’ve teamed up with a sex offender.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: So, when are you getting a plastic fuck
doll?</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: All right. I’m sorry. I’m pathetic.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: What? What is it?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: This place is like a scumbag yard sale.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: We gotta come down here once a week and
clean house.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: You sure about this guy?</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Oh man. You gotta let me do these guys. I’m
such a moron. I gotta make up for the tit thing.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: No way. I’ve been waitin’ for this
asshole.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Aw, c’mon. I gotta clear my family name here.
I’ve brought shame to the house of Della Rocco.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Give the guy a shot.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Rocco, this is the real deal. We must kill
without hesitation, without guilt or remorse. Evil man, dead man.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Wyatt-fuckin’-Earp, man!</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: You guys gotta teach me that prayer, man.
That’s some good shit.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Forget it. It’s a family prayer. My father,
his father before him that sort of shit.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: C’mon!</p>
<p><strong>augustus</strong>: Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>yakavetta</strong>: Hey, Augustus, I need your help, I got a
serious problem here. I’m not screwing around.</p>
<p><strong>augustus</strong>: I bounced you on my knee at family
reunions, for Christ sakes. Your dad and me ran the whole east coast
syndicate you snot-nosed little prick. And when you took the wheel, who
was beside you?</p>
<p><strong>yakavetta</strong>: Hey, I just…</p>
<p><strong>augustus</strong>: Don’t start with your shit. Don’t you talk
to me. Oh, hey Uncle Gussy, thanks for years of service. Here’s a gold
watch and a job sniffing other guys’ shit eight hours a day. What am I,
a retired bus driver?</p>
<p><strong>yakavetta</strong>: I need Il Duce.</p>
<p><strong>augustus</strong>: The Duke? What did you do?</p>
<p><strong>yakavetta</strong>: This kid, this package boy could bring
down the whole east coast. If he decides to turn states he could
dismantle us… totally. But it looks like for now, he’s content with just
killing us one by one. And even worse the kid is good at it. I mean I
had a prodigy on my hands the whole time and didn’t even know it.</p>
<p><strong>augustus</strong>: Listen kid, I think you better understand
who you’re dealing with here.</p>
<p><strong>yakavetta</strong>: Yeah. I was only twelve or thirteen when
you guys used to talk about him, like he was a ghost or something.</p>
<p><strong>augustus</strong>: Your dad and I used him three times over
twenty years, only when everything went totally fucked. Believe me kid,
you don’t want this guy unless you are 100% sure you need him. He is… a
fuckin’ monster.</p>
<p><strong>mr. cobb</strong>: Do you feel you have been
rehabilitated?</p>
<p><strong>augustus</strong>: I’ve had this guy in front of me, and I
couldn’t tell you what he looks like, sounds like. He is the Picasso of
assassins, kid. He plants hair samples, blood. Puts skin under
fingernails. He is a fucking genius. Only one problem. He’s been rotting
in prison for twenty-five or thirty years. Don’t even know if he’s still
alive. Or if he’s even up to it.</p>
<p><strong>yakavetta</strong>: There’s ways around that.</p>
<p><strong>augustus</strong>: Go find one.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Let’s talk some business here. I know a sick
fuck… makes the ones we been doing look like altar boys. Worst night of
my life when I met this guy.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: The guy never says a fuckin’ word to me.
We’re driving for 25 minutes. Never a sigh, no throat clearing, nothing.
And his face, blank man. Just nothing there.</p>
<p><strong>flashcut</strong>: They pull up to a house in a scummy,
Boston Logan Airport neighborhood. Rocco gets out and sits on the hood
smoking as the man makes his way up the walk.</p>
<p><strong>flashcut</strong>: He quietly enters the house and pulls a
large bright-blue plastic tarp from his coat and spreads it across the
floor in the hallway. We hear the sound of Sega video games being
played. He pulls out two pistols with silencers and walk.</p>
<p><strong>flashcut</strong>: The man drags a dead dog across the
kitchen floor, leaving a streak of blood. FLASHCUT : He drags the bodies
of two kids, two men and the woman down the hall toward us leaving the
hall carpet streaked with blood.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: I didn’t see what he was doing while he was
in there.</p>
<p><strong>flashcut</strong>: The man pulls out a large hunting knife
and disappears into each room. The sounds of hacking are heard.</p>
<p><strong>flashcut</strong>: We see from his p.o.v. a pile of broken
bodies, bloody debris and a dead dog with a mop sticking out the
top.</p>
<p><strong>flashcut</strong>: The man steps outside and motions Rocco
in.</p>
<p><strong>the man</strong>: I have a poker game at the house every
Saturday with a couple of guys you know. Why don’t you come down? Wife
makes a hell of a bar-g-que.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Yeah… yeah, I’d like that. Tell me something.
What did they do?</p>
<p><strong>the man</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Worst day of my life, man.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Well, I’m sold.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Don’t worry, Roc. We’ll do this guy right
and you’ll feel a lot better.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Who the fuck was he, Rocco? I know you
fuckin’ know!</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Fuck you! I told you I never saw him
before!</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Well he sure as fuck knew you!</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Fuck you both! Ya ask me, he was aiming at
you!</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Okay. Here’s what happened.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: They waited in a parked car down the street
for the kid to leave.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: There he goes. Okay, gentlemen. Are we ready
to bring this man into the light? Are we ready to truly do the work of
the Lord?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: A-fuckin’-men!</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: This is so fuckin’ cool!</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: They went in through the garage. The kid
says he leaves it open when he takes his bike out.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Now, they know the wife is the gate keeper.
She knows the code.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Don’t fuck with me lady. I’ll kill you.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: The wife says she doesn’t know what
happened after she hit the code. She just remembers going down. But,
judging by the burn mark on her back, I think what they did…</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: …was use a stun gun on her.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Now the guy knows a friend is coming to the
game. And they know that this door can only be opened from the inside.
So they wait… and when that door opens, man…</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: All of them.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Nobody was ready for it. Devastation,
panic! This was like shooting fish in a fuckin’ barrel!</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Now these guys dove under the table. The
trajectory on the bullets show they came from straight across. So this
means one of our shooters… dropped to his knees…</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Shit!… Shit! He ain’t here.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: What the fuck do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: I mean he ain’t here.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Look again for fuck sake!</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: I know what the fuck he looks like!</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Something went wrong. Right here.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Let the boy go!</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: C’mon Roc!</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Now, one of these guys is a real sicko. He
knew this man. He wanted him to suffer, to feel every second of a
painful death.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Help me you assholes! He’s gonna fuckin’ kill
me!</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: This guy is one bad motherfucker.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: I don’t wanna die!!!!!</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: I’ve never seen wounds like these before,
but whatever he used on this guy, it was a blunt object and they took it
with them.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: They exited out the front door. And they
had no fucking idea what they were in for.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Now they are staring at six guys with guns
drawn. It was a fucking ambush.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: And this was a fucking bomb dropping in
Beaver Cleaverville! For a few seconds this place was Armageddon! There
was a fire fight!</p>
<p><strong>il duce</strong>: No!… No! No!…</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: What if it was just one guy with six
guns?</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Why don’t you let me do the thinking, huh,
genius?</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: What is taking so long with those blood
samples?</p>
<p><strong>forensics woman #1</strong>: I can’t get a good sample. There
is variable here I’m not seeing.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: They used ammonia… none of this shit is any
good… Fuck… You know what this means?! Even if we get suspects in this
case, we got nothing… Nothing!</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Who the fuck are they?! I’ve never seen
any-fucking-thing like this in my whole fucking life. Who the fuck are
they?!!</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: What? That’s it?!</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: What? What, that guy?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: That’s the guy that got us off the hook with
the “Checkov” thing.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: And he is one smart man.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: They got nothing.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: This guy is very sharp. If he hasn’t figured
us out yet, he will.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: You bet your ass he will.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Well, I’d say that makes him a lia-
fuckin-bility.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: He isn’t to be touched.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: He’s a good man.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Okay… whatever. My Mom’s gonna kill me.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: No. This is all wrong. David Della
Rocco?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Boston Police Department.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Yeah. Maria, this is Smecker. Could you
find me the visitor’s list for the day the MacManus brothers were in and
read me all the names?</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Okay, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: You’ve had quite a bit, Paul. Are you
sure you…</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Pour the drink, faggot-ass!</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Okay… But I don’t cuddle.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Hey! We gotta talk about this early morning
church shit.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: We have to go now. We’re on the lamb.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: You gonna do what I say, got it?</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: I’m sorry you’re gonna hafta see this. Don’t
look at me!</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: I’m sorry, I’m sorry. I didn’t see.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Shut up! Shut the fuck up!</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Don’t do this my son.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Open it!</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Have you no fear of God?</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: That’s who I’m doing this for, now open the
fuckin’ thing.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Father, I’ll do you right here.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: God have mercy on my soul.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: You little fuck. Let him go. I’ll drop you
right here.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Okay, just calm down. He could hurt us,
brother. He could ruin the whole thing.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Let him go or I will deliver you, right
now.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: You won’t do it Connor, you won’t. You love
me man.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Hello? You there?</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Y-Yes my son.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Do your thing Father. Don’t fuck this up.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: What do you want me to say?</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Just be natural, goddamit.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: How long since your last confession, my
son?</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Oh, Christ, uh, I’ve never confessed.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: According to the dogma of the Catholic
church, I should probably burst into flames right here in this booth.
But I’ve come here for advice, not salvation.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Why have you come to a church for council if
you’re not religious?</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Why have I come to a church? I never have
before. I guess I just… felt I should.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: What is it my son?</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: It’s ethics. I put evil men behind bars,
but the law has miles of red tape and loopholes for these… cocksuckers
to slip through. I’ve found out there are these two young men who fix
the situation with an iron fist. As if they have God’s permission. But
what they do is wrong and I should arrest them… technically.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: God’s permission? God doesn’t…</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: But in this day and age I believe what they
do is… necessary. I feel it is… correct.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: You believe?</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: You feel?</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: You feel? A soul is what gives you feelings.
Happiness, guilt, right or wrong. It is a conduit through which the Lord
speaks to us. You felt that your answers would be here in the house of
God today. You feel these men are necessary. The Lord has spoken to you
twice this day.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Has he now?</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: You have entered the house of the Lord of
your own free will speaking of beliefs and feelings. Is it so much to
believe that God has brought you here?</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: I guess not.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: It is easy to be sarcastic about religion.
It is harder to take small hints from God, your feelings and listen to
them… to take a stand.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: You’re right.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Those who do not act are in a constant state
of ethical indecision.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: I want to stand for what I believe in,
father.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Then you must find out what your beliefs
are.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: I believe these young men are right.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: You know them personally?</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Do you think they would harm an innocent
man, for any reason?</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: No. They would never do that.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Well, the two Irish guys wouldn’t. But the
Italian guy, he might. He’s kind of an idiot.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Goddam right, I am.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: I’m beginning to see. I’ve been doing my
job… well for fifteen years and it’s just not enough. All the things I
wish I could do, these guys are doing. Millions of dollars in tax
payers’ money wasted on shit like wire taps and surveillance. Theses
boys go in and take care of it for the price of a bullet. Ww-what do you
think I should do? Because I’m a law man.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: The laws of God are higher than the laws of
man.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Yes! Yes! I was thinking that, too. No. I
was feeling it. All I needed was to hear you say it! Amen! I’ll help
them.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Forgive me father.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Thank you, Father, thank you. Whatever.
Goodbye, amen.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: I wouldn’t have, uh, killed you, Father.
Dominus Ominus. Remember, you’re bound. You can’t talk about this… to
anyone.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Just go!</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: The Lord works in mysterious ways.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: That’s all you can give me?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Well, the light caught the side of his face
for a second. And it looked like he had a gray beard, maybe… late
fifties, early sixties.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: So you’re telling me it was one guy with
six guns? A-and he was a senior fucking citizen?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: I think it’s better if we find this man
before he finds us again.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: I’ll see what I can do. How do I get in
touch with you?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: We’re going to hit Poppa Joe tonight, right
in the comfort of his own home. Then we move on to New York. It’s
getting a bit hot for us here.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Be careful.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: I’ll call you tonight, afterwards.</p>
<p><strong>augustus</strong>: I don’t know who he is. Nobody does.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: What did he bring him in for?</p>
<p><strong>augustus</strong>: Needed an outsider. The package boy knows
everyone. He’d spot our hitters a mile away.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Just for him?</p>
<p><strong>augustus</strong>: Well he’s the one shooting up all his
guys, right? He’s scared of the kid. Says he’s real good, got every
available gun in the city up there.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Up where?</p>
<p><strong>augustus</strong>: Up his house. I don’t know what’s going on
but I know it’s gotta have something to do with this kid.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: Oh fuck!</p>
<p><strong>yakavetta</strong>: You gonna tell me what’s going on here?!
Huh! You little fuck! Gimme some answers!</p>
<p><strong>yakavetta</strong>: What do you guys think?</p>
<p><strong>geno</strong>: They’re tough. No way they’re gonna talk.</p>
<p><strong>hojo</strong>: I know Rocco. He ain’t smart enough for this
shit. These other guys are the brains. He’s just a player.</p>
<p><strong>yakavetta</strong>: There’s only one way to get them to
talk.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: You guys?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: We’re here brother.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: You gotta keep going.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: We’ll keep going, Roc.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: You’ll make it outta here. You can’t ever
stop, not ever.</p>
<p><strong>chappy</strong>: Once you set him in motion, you can’t call
him off. He thinks it’s still on.</p>
<p><strong>yakavetta</strong>: Oh Jesus Christ!</p>
<p><strong>hojo</strong>: What? I…</p>
<p><strong>yakavetta</strong>: Hey, I don’t have my name spray painted
on the front of this house. There are no big pictures of me anywhere. If
this guy thinks the job is still a go then I got green money says the
mother fucker’s out in the bushes already. I’m fucking gone! I’m leaving
you guys to deal with this.</p>
<p><strong>geno</strong>: One fucking guy, so what.</p>
<p><strong>hojo</strong>: Why don’t you take the front. You guys cover
those other exits and if you see him, don’t flag him down, just kill the
mother fucker. I’m going back down to work on these pricks.</p>
<p><strong>smecker as woman</strong>: Joey Bevo sent me over. As
entertainment.</p>
<p><strong>geno</strong>: Listen baby. Tonight ain’t the night for this
shit. Bevo’s so great. Always sending us hot girls.</p>
<p><strong>smecker</strong>: You look like you could use a quickie.</p>
<p><strong>geno</strong>: Hey, Chappy!</p>
<p><strong>chappy</strong>: What the fuck?</p>
<p><strong>geno</strong>: I ain’t been laid in a week. Take five
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>chappy</strong>: If I die cause you’re getting a piece of
ass, I’ll come back and beat you to death with a big rubber dick.</p>
<p><strong>geno</strong>: Don’t worry about it.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: How far are we going with this, Da?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: The questions is not, “how far?” The
question is, “Do you possess the constitution, the depth of faith to go
as far as is needed?”</p>
<p><strong>media man 1</strong>: Look at his charisma. He’s the next
John Gotti.</p>
<p><strong>media man 2</strong>: He’ll walk. Even with all this
evidence.</p>
<p><strong>media man 1</strong>: Look. All Yakavetta’s people are on the
right. All the families of the men he has killed are on the left.
Everyone wants some justice.</p>
<p><strong>media man 2</strong>: Look at him. He doesn’t have a care in
the world. He’s gonna walk.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: How long do these put a man down for?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Ten minutes.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Twenty is a bit better.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Due to the lack of hard evidence……</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: All media to the back! Drop the cameras!
Drop ’em!</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: You people have been chosen to reveal our
existence to the world. You will witness what happens here today and you
will tell of it afterwards.</p>
<p><strong>yakavetta</strong>: Fuckin’ do something!</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: You must watch dear. It’ll all be over
soon.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Now, you will receive us.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: We do not ask for your poor or your
hungry.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: We do not want your tired and sick.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: It is your corrupt we claim.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: It is your evil, who will be sought by
us.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: With every breath we shall hunt them
down.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Each day we will spill their blood till it
rains down from the skies.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Do not kill, do not rape, do not steal.
These are principles which every man of every faith can embrace.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: These are not polite suggestions. They are
codes of behavior and those that ignore them will pay the dearest
cost.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: There are varying degrees of evil. We urge
you lesser forms of filth Not to push the bounds and cross over into
true corruption… into our domain.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: For if you do, there will come the day when
you look behind you and see we three. And on that day you will reap
it.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: And we will send you to whatever God you
wish.</p>
<p><strong>reporter 2</strong>: Yes! Were you in the courtroom miss? Did
you see?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Yes. I was there.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: How do you feel about what they did?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: I guess we all know what is right and wrong.
We all know. Nobody needs to be convinced of what he was… I’m going home
now to have my first real full night’s sleep.</p>
