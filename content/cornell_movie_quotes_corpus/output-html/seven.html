<p><strong>man</strong>: Is something wrong?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Is there something the matter?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: No. No… it’s just that everything here
seems… so strange.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Strange? There’s nothing strange about this
place. The house’ll need a little fixing up, that’s for sure…</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: No. I like the house, and this place.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I was about to say. Cause this place is about
as normal as places get.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: That’s what I mean. Strange.</p>
<p><strong>cab driver</strong>: What’s the big fuss?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Why do you care?</p>
<p><strong>cab driver</strong>: Well, excuse me all to hell.</p>
<p><strong>cab driver</strong>: Crazy fucks.</p>
<p><strong>cab driver</strong>: Where you headed?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Far away from here.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Neighbors heard them screaming at each other
for like two hours. It was nothing new. But, then they heard the gun go
off. Both barrels.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Did the wife confess?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: When the patrolman came she was trying put
his head back together. She was crying too hard to say anything.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Why always like this? Only after the fact…
this sudden realization, that if you shoot someone, or stick a knife in
them, that person will cease to exist.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Crime of passion.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Yes. Look at all the passion splattered up
on the wall here.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: This is a done deal. All but the
paperwork.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Did their son see it happen?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: What kind of fucking question is that
anyway?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: You know, we’re all real glad we’re getting
rid of you, Somerset. You know that? I mean, it’s always these questions
with you… “Did the kid see it?” Well, who gives a fuck? Huh? He’s dead.
His wife killed him.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Anything else has nothing to do with us.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Uh, Lieutenant Somerset?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I’m a little thrown. I just got in town like
twenty minutes ago and they dumped me here.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Since we’re just starting out, I thought
we could go to a bar… sit and talk for awhile. After that, we’ll…</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Actually, if it’s all the same, I’d like to
get to the precinct house a.s.a.p. Seeing how we don’t have much time
for this whole transition thing.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I need to start getting the feel of it all,
right? Meet the people.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I meant to ask you something, Mills, when
we spoke on the phone. I can’t help wondering… why here?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I… I don’t follow.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: All this effort you’ve made to get
transferred, it’s the first question that pops into my head.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I’m here for the same reasons as you, I
guess. Or, at least, the same reasons you used to have for being here
before… before you decided to… quit.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: You just met me.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Maybe I’m not understanding the question.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: It’s very simple. You worked a nice, quiet
town, but you fought to get here as if your life depended on it. I’ve
just never seen it done that way before, Detective.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Maybe I thought I could do more good here
than there. I don’t know. Look, it’d be great by me if we didn’t start
right off kicking each other in the balls. But, you’re calling the
shots, Lieutenant, so… however you want it to go.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Let me tell you how I want this to go. I
want you to look, and I want you to listen.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I wasn’t standing around guarding the local
Taco Bell. I’ve worked homicide for five and a half years.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Not here.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I realize that.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Well, over the next seven days, do me the
favor of remembering it.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Honey… where are we?</p>
<p><strong>davis</strong>: Everything’s like I found it. I didn’t touch
anything.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: What time did you confirm the death?</p>
<p><strong>davis</strong>: Like I said, I didn’t touch him, but he’s had
his face in a plate of spaghetti for about forty-five minutes now.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Hold on… you mean you didn’t check for vital
signs?</p>
<p><strong>davis</strong>: Did I stutter? Believe me, he ain’t
breathing, unless he’s started breathing spaghetti sauce.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: The point is, whenever you find…</p>
<p><strong>davis</strong>: Begging your pardon, but the guy’s sitting in
pile of his own shit and piss. If he ain’t dead, he would’ve stood up by
now.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Thank you, officer. We’ll need to talk to
you again, after we’ve looked around.</p>
<p><strong>davis</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I wonder what exactly was the point of the
conversation you were about to get into?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: And I wonder how many times Officer Davis
there has found a dead man who wasn’t really dead until Davis was in the
car calling it in and eating a donut.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Drop it.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: For now.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Enjoy.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Christ… somebody phone Guiness. I think we’ve
got a World’s Record here.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Who said this was murder?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: No one yet.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Then, why are we wasting our time? This guy’s
heart’s got to be roughly the size of a canned ham. If this isn’t a
coronary, I don’t know what is.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Or not.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Still… he could have tied himself up, to make
it look like murder. I saw a guy once… committed suicide, but wanted to
make sure his family could collect the life insurance, right?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: When we found him, he was lying there with a
knife in his back, so what else could it be but homicide? Except, I
finally figured out… he held the knife behind him… put the tip of it in
his own back and got real close to the wall… then he shoved his body
backwards…</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Please be quiet for a while, would
you?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Oh, yes, sir. Forgive me.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: There’s a bucket here.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: There’s a bucket. Under the table.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: It’s vomit.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: It’s a bucket of vomit.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Is there any blood in it?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I don’t know. Feel free to look for yourself,
okay?</p>
<p><strong>o’neill</strong>: Wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: You think it was poison?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Guessing at this point is useless.</p>
<p><strong>o’neill</strong>: You girls have got forensics waiting
outside. I don’t know if we’ll all fit though.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: There’s room. Light’s the problem.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Still… two is company here. And, three is
certainly a crowd. Detective Mills, go help the officers question the
neighbors.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I’d rather stay on this.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Send one of the forensics in on your way
out.</p>
<p><strong>o’neill</strong>: He is dead.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Thank you, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: You’ve seen my files, right? Seen the things
I’ve done?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Anyway… I did my time on door-to-doors, and
walking a beat. I did all that shit for a long time.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: The badge in my pocket says “detective,” same
as yours.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I made a decision, because I have to
consider the integrity of the scene. I can’t worry whether you think
you’re getting enough time on the playing field.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Yeah, well, all I want is… Just, just don’t
be jerking me off. That’s all I ask. Don’t jerk me off.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: We’ll be spending every waking hour
together till I leave. I’ll show you who your friends are, and your
enemies. I’ll help you cut through the red tape and I will help you
“integrate,” as the captain puts it. However… No matter how much you beg
or plead… jerking off is something you’ll have to do for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Is that clear?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Okay… sure… It’s just that, with my old
partner, you know…</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I just don’t think we should have that
sort of relationship. We’d start quarreling over insignificant
things.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Whatever you say, Detective. Beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: He’s been dead for a long time, and I can
tell you it was not a poison.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Ah, man… how does somebody let himself go
like that? Look at the blubber.</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: It took four orderlies and me all together
just to put this body on the table.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: How did the fat fuck ever fit out the door of
his apartment?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Yes, it’s obvious he was a shut-in. Not an
enviable life, but, maybe he still deserves a modicum of respect in
spite of that.</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: Are you looking here? First… see how big
this stomach is. And, see the strange thing. Stretches. And, here it is
distended. Look at the size of that, because of all the foods.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I can see what you’re pointing at, but…</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: Lines of distention across the stomach,
and parts have ripped open.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Doctor, are you saying… this man ate till
he burst?</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: Well, he didn’t really burst. Not all the
way. But, he was bleeding inside himself, and there is a hematoma on the
outside, on the belly. Very large.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: He died by eating?</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: Yes. And, there’s something else here you
have to look at and see.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: These bruises on the victim’s head…</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: I don’t kow what they are yet. They…</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: They could have been caused by a gun. The
barrel of a gun… pressed against the back of his head.</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: If it was jammed against him hard enough,
sure. It’s possible. Here…</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: Most of the stomach’s food contents are in
the lab now…. but, these… I found these in his stomach too.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Plastic?</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: Why these are in a fat man’s stomach, I
don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Same color and texture.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Have you found any plastic scrapings near the
stove or sink? Near the food?</p>
<p><strong>male forensic</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: This doesn’t make any sense.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: You always have to find one singular thing
to focus on. There’s always one thing, and it may be as small as a speck
of dust, but you find it and focus… till it’s an exhausted
possibility.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: It could be nothing.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: But, why would there be so many pieces in
his stomach if it were nothing? It must have been intentional.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Come here.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Holy shit.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: The bruises were caused by the muzzle of a
forty-five. So, there was a gun against his head and he was given a
choice. Eat, or get your brains blown out.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: He ate his fill, and was forced to
continue eating… till his body rejected the food. the killer held a
bucket under him, and then kept serving. He took his time. The coroner
says this might have gone on for more than twelve hours. The victim’s
throat was swollen from the effort, and there was probably a point where
he passed out. That’s when killer kicked him in the stomach. Popped
him.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: This was one sadistic motherfucker.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: That seems obvious.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: “Dear Detectives, Long is the way, and
hard, that out of hell leads up to light.” It’s the murderer’s way of
announcing himself.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Announcing what?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: There are seven deadly sins. Gluttony,
wrath, greed…</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: So what? This victim…</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: … envy, sloth, pride and lust. Seven.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Hey, so gluttony is one of the seven deadly
sins. But, this was a fat guy. The killer may have felt this was the
just best way to torture him. And, writing on the walls happens all the
time. It’s like the fashionable thing to do.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: One is gluttony.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: This is his stuff. I’ve been out in the cold
all day.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: This is a premeditated puzzle, and it’s
only the beginning.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Always working up there, huh, Somerset? Big
brain’s always cooking.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I’m declining this case. I want us
reassigned.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Whoa, whoa… what?!</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: What’s this: “I’m declining this case?” It
don’t work that way.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: This can’t be my last duty here. It will
go on and on.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: I know what you’re thinking, okay? You
don’t want to get in bed with this every night, but it’s different now.
You’re retiring. In six days you’re all the way gone.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: You’ve left unfinished business before.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Everything else was taken as close to
conclusion as humanly possible. Also… this shouldn’t be his first
assignment.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: This isn’t my first assignment, dickhead.
What the hell?</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: I don’t have anyone else to give this to,
Somerset, you know that. And nobody’s going to swap with you.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Give it to me.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: How’s that?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: There’s nothing that says I have to work with
him. If Somerset wants out, “goodbye.” Give it to me.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: It’s too soon for him.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Can we talk about this in private?</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: That’s not necessary. You’re in.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Go start picking up the pieces. We’ll
shuffle some paper and try to get you a new partner.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: You win, Somerset. You’re out.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Excuse us. We have some business to take
care of.</p>
<p><strong>workman</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Have you heard?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: No, I haven’t heard.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: There was a second.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Already.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Greed. It was written in blood.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: It’s none of my business anymore.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: I thought you might want to be filled
in.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I’m sure everyone’s doing their best.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Come on. What are you going to do with
yourself out there?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I’ll get a job, maybe on a farm. I’ll work
on the house.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Can’t you feel it yet? Can’t you feel that
feeling… ? You’re not going to be a cop anymore.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: You know.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Did you read in the paper today, about the
man who was walking his dog? he was attacked, and his wallet and his
watch were taken. And then, while he was still lying unconscious, his
attacker stabbed him with a knife in both eyes. It happened four blocks
from here.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: I heard.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I have no understanding of this place
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: It’s always been like this.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Maybe you’re right.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: You do this work. You were made for it, and
I don’t think you can deny that. I certainly can’t believe you’re
trading it in for a tool belt and a fishing rod. Maybe I’m wrong.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Try putting a little elbow grease into
it.</p>
<p><strong>vagrant</strong>: Spare me a cigarette? Spare a
cigarette?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Sorry, last one.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Sit where you’d like.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Thanks, George.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Hey there, Smilely.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Evening, gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>first guard</strong>: Come on, George. Cards are getting
cold.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Duty calls.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: All these books, gentlemen… a world of
knowledge at your disposal, and you play poker all night.</p>
<p><strong>janitor</strong>: We got culture.</p>
<p><strong>second guard</strong>: Yeah, we got culture coming out our
asses.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: How’s this for culture?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Where’d you get to, Smilely?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Thank you.</p>

<p><strong>mills</strong>: How’s it coming?</p>
<p><strong>forensic one</strong>: Nothing yet.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Shut the fuck up.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Fucking, Dante, goddamn, poetry-writing,
faggot motherfucker…</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Good work, Officer. Good work.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Thank God.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Let me get out of your way.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: It’s a package deal. You get the phone
with the office.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Detective Mills here. Honey… I asked you not
to call me here. I’ll call you back… What? Why?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Why? Okay… okay, hold on.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: It’s my wife.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Hello? Yes, well… it’s nice to speak to
you. Well, I appreciate the thought… but… Then, I guess I’d be
delighted. Thank you very much. Yes… goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I’m invited to have a late supper at your
house. And, I accept.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: How’s that?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Tonight.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I don’t even know if I’m having dinner there
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Hello, men. You made it.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Hi, honey.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I’d like you to meet Somerset.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: It’s nice to meet you. My husband has told me
a lot about you… except your first name.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Oh… um, William.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: It’s a nice name. William, I’d like you to
meet David. David… William.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Great… I’m, uh, just going to put these
things away.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: It smells good.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: What? Oh, yes. I mean, thank you. Please, sit
down.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: You can put that over on the couch. You’ll
have to excuse all the mess. We’re still unpacking.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I hear you and Mills were high school
sweethearts.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: High school and college, yes. Pretty hokey,
huh? I knew on our first date this was the man I was going to marry.
God… he was the funniest man I’d ever met.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Well, it’s rare these days… that kind of
commitment.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Don’t worry. I don’t wear it at the dinner
table.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: No matter how often I see guns, I still can’t
get used to them.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Same here.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Anyway… what girl wouldn’t want the captain
of the football team as their lifetime mate? Here… you dropped
something…</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: What is that?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: My future.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: You have a strange way about you… I mean
interesting. I’m sorry. It’s really none of my business. It’s just nice
to meet a man who talks like that. If David saw that paper, he’d say
you’re a fag. That’s how he is.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I guess I won’t be showing it to him
then.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Why aren’t you married, William?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Tracy… what the hell?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I was close once. It just didn’t
happen.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: It surprises me. It really does.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Any person who spends a significant amount
of time with me finds me… disagreeable. Just ask your husband.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Very true.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: How long have you lived here?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Too long. What do you think so far?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: It takes time to settle in.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Well, you can get numb to it pretty
quickly. There are things in any city…</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Subway train.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: It’ll go away in a minute.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: This real estate guy… this miserable fuck, he
brought us to see this place a few times. And, first I’m thinking he’s
good, really efficient. But then, I started wondering, why does he keep
hurrying us along? Why will he only show us this place for like five
minutes at a time?</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: We found out the first night.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: The soothing, relaxing, vibrating home.
Sorry…</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Oh, fuck.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: I don’t think I’ve ever met anyone who
doesn’t have a television before. That’s… weird.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: It’s un-American is what it is.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: All television does is teach children that
it’s really cool to be stupid and eat candy bars all day.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: What about sports?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: What about them?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: You go to movies at least?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I read. Remember reading?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I just have to say, I can’t respect any man
who’s never seen “Green Acres.”</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: You’ve never seen “The Odd Couple?” This is
sick. “The Honeymooners?!”</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I vaguely recall a large, angry man, and
someone called Norton.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Our guy got into office, probably before the
building closed and security tightened up. Gould must have been working
late.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I’m certain. He was the biggest defense
lawyer around. Infamous, actually.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Well, his body was found Monday night, okay?
But, get this… the office was closed all day Monday. Which means, as
long as the gluttony killing was done before the weekend, our killer
could’ve gotten in here on Friday. He could’ve spent all day Saturday
with Gould, and all day Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Gould was tied down, nude. The killer left
his arms free and handed him a big, sharp butcher’s knife. See… the
scale here.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: A pound of flesh.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: “One pound of flesh, no more no less. No
cartilage, no bone, but only flesh. This task done… and he would go
free.”</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: The leather chair was soaked through with
sweat.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: All day Saturday, and all day Sunday. The
murderer would want Gould to take his time. To have to sit there and
decide. Where do you make the first cut? There’s a gun in your face…
but, what part of your body is expendable?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: He cut along the side of his stomach. The
love handle.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: He must have left another puzzle
piece.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Look, I appreciate being able to talk this
out, but, uh…</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: This is just to satisfy my curiosity. I’m
still leaving town Saturday.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Gould’s wife. She was away on business. If
this means she saw anything, I don’t know what. We’ve questioned her at
least five times.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: And, if it’s a threat.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: We put her in a safe house.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Look at these with fresh eyes. Don’t see
what the killer wants you to. Don’t let guide you…</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Even if the corpse is right there… it’s
almost like looking through it. Editing out the initial shock. Look at
the room.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: He’s preaching.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Punishing.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: The sins were used in medieval sermons.
There were seven cardinal virtues, and then seven deadly sins, created
as a learning tool, because they distract from true worship.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Like in the Parson’s Tale, and Dante.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Did you read them?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Yeah. Parts of them. Anyway, in Purgatory,
Dante and his buddy are climbing up that big mountain… seeing all these
other guys who sinned…</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Seven Terraces of Purgation.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Right. But there, pride comes first, not
gluttony. The sins are in a different order.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: For now, let’s just consider the books as
the murderer’s inspiration. The books and sermons are about atonement
for sin. And, these murders have been like forced attrition.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Forced what?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Attrition. When you regret your sins, but
not because you love God.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Like, because someone’s holding a gun on
you.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: No fingerprints?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Totally unrelated victims.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: No witnesses of any kind?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: None. Which I don’t understand. He had to get
back out.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: In any major city, minding your own
business is a perfected science. There’s a public crime prevention
course offered at the precinct house once a month. The first thing they
teach is that you should never cry “help.” Always scream “fire,” because
people don’t want to get caught up in anything. But a fire… that’s an
evening’s entertainment. They come running.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: This is the one thing.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: What if it’s not that she’s seen
something? What if she’s supposed to see something, but she just hasn’t
been given a chance to see it yet?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Okay. But, what?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I’m sorry about this, Mrs. Gould. I really
am.</p>
<p><strong>mrs gould</strong>: I… I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I need you to look at each one carefully…
very carefully. Look for anything that seems strange or out of place.
Anything at all.</p>
<p><strong>mrs gould</strong>: I don’t know why… why now?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Please, I need you to help me if we’re going
to get who did this.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Anything… anything missing or different.</p>
<p><strong>mrs gould</strong>: I don’t see anything.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Are you absolutely certain?</p>
<p><strong>mrs gould</strong>: I can’t do this now… please.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Maybe we better wait.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: It should be now. There may be something
we’re not seeing.</p>
<p><strong>mrs gould</strong>: Wait. Here…</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>mrs gould</strong>: This painting…</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mrs gould</strong>: Why is this painting hanging
upside-down?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: You’re sure your men didn’t move this?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Even if they did, those photos were taken
before forensics.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: It’s got to be.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: He changed the wire to rehang it.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: What the fuck is that?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: A switchblade.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Nothing. Damn it!</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: The killer didn’t paint the fucking thing.
Give it up.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: There must be something.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: We’re screwed. He’s fucking with us.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Motherfucker!</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Bear with me.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Oh, yeah, sure. You got to be kidding?!</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Just wait!</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Call the print lab.</p>
<p><strong>male forensic</strong>: Oh, man…</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Just, honestly… have you ever seen anything
like this… been involved in anything like this?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>male forensic</strong>: … just by looking at the shape of the
underloop on these, they are not the victim’s fingerprints.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: He just may be nuts enough.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: It doesn’t fit. He doesn’t want us to help
him stop.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Who the hell knows? There’s plenty of freaks
out there doing dirty deeds they don’t want to do. You know… little
voices tell them bad things.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: I’ve seen this baby take as long as
three days to make a match, so you guys can go cross your fingers
somewhere else.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: You meant what you said to Mrs. Gould,
didn’t you? About catching this guy. You really want to believe that,
don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: And you don’t?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I wish I still thought like you.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Then, you tell me what you think we’re
doing.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: All we do is pick up the pieces. We take
all the evidence, and all the pictures and samples. We write everything
down and note what time things happened…</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Oh, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: We put it in a nice neat pile and file it
away, on the slim chance it’s ever needed in a courtroom. It’s like
collecting diamonds on a desert island. You keep them just in case you
ever get rescued, but it’s a pretty big ocean out there.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I’m, sorry, but even the most promising
clues usually lead only to other clues. I’ve seen so many corpses rolled
away… unrevenged.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I’ve seen the same. I’m not the country hick
you seem to think I am.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: In this city, if all the skeletons came
out of all the closets… if ever hidden body were to suddenly rise again,
there’d be no more room for the living.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Don’t tell me you didn’t get that rush
tonight… that adrenalin, like we were getting somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: And, don’t try to tell me it was because you
found something that would play well in a courtroom.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Wake up, Glimmer Twins. We have a
winner.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: He goes by the name Victor, as many of you
know, and his prints were found on scene by Detectives Mills and
Somerset.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Now, this guy’s a real beauty. He has a
long, long history of serious mental illness. According the
head-shrinkers, it seems his parents gave him a very strict, Southern
Baptist upbringing, but somewhere along the line he dropped his
marbles.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Hey, you two can shut-up now!</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Thank you, fuckheads. Now, Victor spent a
couple of months in prison for the attempted rape of an eight year old
boy, but his lawyer made sure he didn’t stay long. Before that, he
dabbled in drugs, armed robbery and assault. We’ve been doing our best
to keep an eye on him, but he’s been out of circulation for a while.</p>
<p><strong>female cop</strong>: If he disappeared, what do you want from
us?</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: His last place of residence is still in his
name. A search warrant is being pushed through the courts as we
speak.</p>
<p><strong>california</strong>: So, have the housing cops walk up and
ring the doorbell.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Listen, California. When you go in, if
Victor isn’t home, one of his buddies might be house-sitting, so you go
in guns first. Besides using, Victor deals, and we know what kind of
crowd he runs with.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: This is what the D.A. has a hard-on for
right now, Ladies and Germs, so we do not question why.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Does this make it with you?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Doesn’t seem like our man, does it?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: You tell me. I’m new in town.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: He doesn’t have the desire somehow. Our
killer seems to have more purpose. More purpose than Victor could ever
conceive of.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: The fingerprints.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Yes. They were there… so, it must be.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: We’ll tag along.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Why would we?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Satisfy our curiosity?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: You ever take one?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Never in my twenty-four years, knock on
wood. I’ve only ever taken my gun out five times with the actual
intention of using it. Never fired it though. Not once. You?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Never took a bullet. I pulled my gun once.
fired it once.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: It was my first one of these. We were a
secondary unit, and I was pretty shaky going in. I was still considered
a rookie.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: We busted the door, looking for this junkie,
right? The geek just opened fire. Another cop was hit in the arm and he
went flying… like in slow motion. I remember riding in the ambulance.
His arm was like Jello. A piece of meat. He bled to death right
there.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: How did the fire fight end?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I got him. I got the son-of-a-bitch. See, I
was doing really good up till then. Lots of street busts. I’ve always
had this weird luck… everything always went my way, but this was wild. I
got him with one shot… right between the eyes. Next thing I know, the
mayor’s pinning a medal on me. Picture in the paper, whole nine
yards.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: How was it?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I expected it to be bad, you know. I took a
human life… but I slept like a baby that night. I never gave it a second
thought.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I think Hemingway wrote somewhere… I can’t
remember where, but he wrote that in order to live in a place like this,
you have to have the ability to kill. I think he meant you truly must be
able to do it, not just faking it, too survive.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Sounds like he knew what he was talking
about.</p>
<p><strong>california</strong>: This is it. Give it up.</p>
<p><strong>black cop</strong>: Cops go before Dicks.</p>
<p><strong>california</strong>: Police! Open the door!!</p>
<p><strong>california</strong>: Good morning, sweetheart!</p>
<p><strong>california</strong>: Get up, now, motherfucker! NOW!</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Jesus…</p>
<p><strong>california</strong>: I said get up, Sleepyhead!</p>
<p><strong>california</strong>: Fuck me!</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Holy shit.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Victor?</p>
<p><strong>black cop</strong>: What the hell… ?</p>
<p><strong>california</strong>: Check this out, Dick…</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: It is Victor.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Call an ambulance.</p>
<p><strong>blond cop</strong>: What the fuck is this?</p>
<p><strong>california</strong>: Somebody call a hearse, more like.</p>
<p><strong>blond cop</strong>: What is going on?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Hey, California, get your people out.</p>
<p><strong>california</strong>: You heard him. Hit the hall, and don’t
touch anything.</p>
<p><strong>california</strong>: It looks like he’s some kind of friggin’
sculpture or something.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Somerset, you… you better look here.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: All pictures of Victor tied to the bed. The
last one is dated three days ago.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: The first one… it’s dated one year ago. To
the day.</p>
<p><strong>california</strong>: Mother…</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: What…?</p>
<p><strong>california</strong>: You got what you deserved, Victor.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: A urine sample, hair sample… stool sample.
Finger nails… He laughing at us.</p>
<p><strong>california</strong>: He’s alive!</p>
<p><strong>california</strong>: He’s still alive!!</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: The way this has gone till now, I wouldn’t
have thought it was possible, but we may have underestimated this
guy.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I want him bad. I don’t just want to catch
him anymore. I want to hurt him.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Listen to me. He’s all about playing
games.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: No kidding! No fucking kidding!</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: We have to divorce ourselves from emotions
here. No matter how hard it is, we have to stay focused on the
details.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I don’t know about you, but I feed off my
emotions.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: He’ll string us along all the way if we’re
not careful.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Are you listening to me?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I hear you.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Say cheese.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: What the fuck are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: I have a right, Officer. I…</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: That doesn’t mean anything! This is a closed
crime scene!</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: You can’t do this! You can’t…</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Get the fuck out of here!</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: How do those cockroaches get here so
quick?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: They pay cops for the inside scoop, and
they pay well.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Sorry about that… I just…</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Oh, it’s alright.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: It’s always impressive to see a man
feeding off his emotions.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: A year of immobility seems about right,
judging by the deterioration of the muscles and the spine. Blood tests
show a whole smorgasbord of drugs in his systems; from crack to heroin…
even an antibiotic which must have been administered to keep the bed
sores from infecting.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: He hasn’t said anything, or tried to express
himself in any way?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Even if his brain were not mush, which it
is… he chewed off his own tongue long ago.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: There’s no way he’ll survive?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Detective, he’d die right how of shock if
you were to shine a flashlight in his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: It’s funny to think… he’s experienced about
as much pain and suffering as anyone I’ve encountered… give or take… and
he still has hell to look forward to.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Victor’s landlord says an envelope of cash
was in the office mailbox each month. He says, quote, “I never heard a
single complaint from the tenant in apartment three-o-one, and nobody
ever complained about him. He’s the best tenant I’ve ever had.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: A landlord’s dream tenant: a paralyzed man
with no tongue.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Who pays the rent on time.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I’m sick of sitting around, waiting for him
to kill again.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: This is the job. It’s not an Easter egg
hunt.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: There must be something in this pile of
garbage we can follow. I mean, Christ… do we have to let this lunatic
make all the moves.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: It’s too dismissive to call him a lunatic.
We can’t make that mistake.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Oh, blah, blah, blah. The guy’s insane.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: It’s a fine line between insane and
inspired.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Hey, Freud, what brand of bullshit are you
shoveling, huh? Right now he’s probably dancing around his room in a
pair of his mommy’s panties, singing show tunes and rubbing himself with
peanut butter…</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Sooner or later his luck’s goning to run
out.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: No. He’s not depending on luck. You’ve
seen that. We walked into that apartment exactly one year after he first
tied Victor to the bed, to the day. To the day! Because he wanted us
to.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: We don’t know for sure…</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Yes we do. Here…</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: This quote… his first words to us. I
looked it up. It’s from Milton’s Paradise Lost. “Long is the way, and
hard, that out of hell leads up to light…”</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: And so what?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Well, he’s been right so far, hasn’t
he?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Just because the bastard has a library card,
it doesn’t make him Einstein.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Just, realize… this is not some common
lunatic. The type of intestinal fortitude it must take… to keep a man
bound for a full year. To connect tubes to his genitals. To sever his
hand and use it to plant fingerprints. He’s methodical and exacting, and
worst of all, he’s patient.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: What does all that matter anyway? It’s not
our job to figure him out, is it? All we have to do is catching him.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: How much money do you have?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I don’t know… like fifty.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I propose a field trip.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Somerset… what the fuck?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: At the top of the list, we’ll put
Purgatory, Canterbury Tales… anything relating to the seven deadly sins.
Now, what the killer might research. What would he need to study to do
the things he’s done? What are his other interests? For example…</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Take one, you stupid fucks! Here… take one!
It’s a fucking coupon! Take it!</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: They had about fifty health violations
during the last inspection.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Could you at least sit across from me? I
don’t want people to thing we’re dating.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Give me your money.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I’m handing you this, and for some strange
reason, I have the idea I should know what the fuck we’re doing.</p>
<p><strong>greasy man</strong>: Hey, Somerset. How are you? I didn’t
know this was going to be a menage-a-trois.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: It’s not a problem.</p>
<p><strong>greasy man</strong>: Only for you do I do this. Big risk
here… so I figure we’ll be even-up. All fair and square.</p>
<p><strong>greasy man</strong>: About an hour.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Well, that was money well spent.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: By telling you this, I’m trusting you more
than I trust most people.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: It’s be best if you got to the point, cause
I’m about ready to punch you in the face.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: It’s probably nothing, but even if it is,
it’s no skin off our teeth. The man at Hot Dog World is a friend, in the
Bureau.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Him?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: For a long time, the F.B.I.’s been hooked
into the library system, keeping accurate records.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: What? Assessing fines?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: They monitor reading habits. Not every
book, but certain ones are flagged. Books about… let’s say, how to build
a nuclear bomb, or maybe Mein Kampf. Whoever takes out a flagged book
has their library records fed to the F.B.I. from then on.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: You got to be kidding.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Flagged books cover every topic the Bureau
deems questionable… communism to violent crime.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: How is this legal?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Legal… illegal. These terms don’t apply. I
don’t applaud it.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: They can’t use the information directly,
but it’s a useful guide. It might sound silly, but you can’t get a
library card without i.d. and a current phone bill.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: So they ran our list.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: If you want to know who’s been reading
Paradise Lost, Purgatory, and say… The Life and Time of Charlie Manson,
the Bureau’s computer will tell you. It might give us a name.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Yeah. Some college student who’s taking
English 101 and just happens to be writing a paper on Twentieth Century
Crime.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Yeah, well… at least we’re out of the
office. We’ve got pizza.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: How do you know all about this?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I don’t. Neither do you.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: This is a waste of time.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: We’re focusing.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I know, I know… focusing on one little
thing.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: The Divine Comedy. A History of
Catholicism. A book called Murderers and Madmen.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Modern Homicide Investigation. In Cold Blood.
Of Human Bondage. Human Bondage?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: It’s not what you think it is.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: The Marquis de Sade and Origins of
Sadism.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: That is.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: The Writings of Saint Thomas Aqu… Aquin…</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Saint Thomas Aquinas. He wrote about the
seven deadly sins.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: You’re sure you’re reading that right? John
Doe?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: That’s what it says. Jonathan Doe.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: This is stupid. It’d be just too easy.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: We’ll take a look at him. Talk to him.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Sure. Uh, excuse me… are you by any chance a
serial killer? Oh, you are? Well, come with us then, if it’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: What are you going to say?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: You do the talking. Put that old silver
tongue of yours to work.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Who told you about my silver tongue? You been
talking to my wife?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: This is really lame.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Mills… !</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Jesus Christ…</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Fuck!</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Brown hat. Tan raincoat… like a… like a
trench coat.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Five… that’s five…</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Second floor! Second floor!</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Get down! Move… !</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: That’s six…</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Mills…</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Mills… ?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Wait… just wait.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: It was him.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: You can’t go in there.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: The hell I can’t! We get in there and we can
stop him.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: We need a warrant.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: We have probable cause now.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Think about it…</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: What the fuck is wrong with you?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Think about how we got here!</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: We can’t tell anyone about this. We can’t
tell them about the Bureau, so we have no reason for being here.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: By the time we clear a warrant someone else
is going to be dead.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Think it through. If we leave a hole like
this, we’ll never prosecute. He’ll walk. We have to come up with some
excuse for knocking on this door.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Okay… okay… get off.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: You stupid son of a…</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: No point in arguing anymore…</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Unless you can fix that.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: How much money do we have left?</p>
<p><strong>thin vagrant</strong>: So, I… I noticed this guy going out…
going out a lot when those murders were happening. So… so I…</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: So, you called Detective Somerset, right?</p>
<p><strong>thin vagrant</strong>: Yeah, I… I called the detective.
Because, because this guy seemed… creepy. And… and…</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: And…</p>
<p><strong>thin vagrant</strong>: And, one of the murders was over
there… over… nearby here. I… I called the cops…</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I told you the rest. You got it?</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Yeah, whatever.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Have him sign it.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Great. Is that it?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Go drink yourself happy.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Wait outside.</p>
<p><strong>handbook of firearms. history of the world. summa

<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Victor.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: We had him.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: The pass was a fake.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: We had him and we let him go.</p>
<p><strong>sketch artist</strong>: You’re sure this is him?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Just put it in circulation.</p>
<p><strong>sketch artist</strong>: You got it. Tomorrow morning, this
city’s good citizens will be on the lookout for Elmer Fudd.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: We can’t find anything to hang on to. No
paystubs, no appointment books or calenders. Not even an address book.
And, you’re not going to believe this…</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Keep looking.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: It’s just… we haven’t found any fingerprints
yet. Not a single one.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: You know, you’re right, I don’t believe you.
Keep looking.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: We could use about fifty more men
here.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I’m trying, alright? Just tell me what we’ve
got.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Well, there are at least five thousand
notebooks in this room, and near as I can tell, each notebook contains
two hundred and fifty pages.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Then, he must write about these murders.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: “What sick, ridiculous, puppets we are,
and what a gross, little stage we dance on. What fun we have, dancing
and fucking, not a care in the world. Not knowing that we are nothing.
We are not what was intended.”</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: “On the subway today, a man came to me to
start a conversation. He made small talk, this lonely man, talking about
the weather and other things. I tried to be pleasant and accommodating,
but my head began to hurt from his banality. I almost didn’t notice it
had happened, but I suddenly threw up all over him. He was not pleased,
and I couldn’t help laughing.”</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: No dates indicated, placed on the shelves
in no discernible order. It’s just his mind poured out on paper. I don’t
think it’s going to give us any specifics.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Looking around… I’ve got a bad feeling these
murders are his life’s work.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Here…</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Okay, John, let’s…</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: You were right.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: He’s preaching.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: These murders are his masterwork. His
sermon to all of us. To all us sinners.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: It’s been a long day, kids. Go home. Just
make sure you sleep with the phone between your legs.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Tracy, is everything alright?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Where’s David?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: It’s alright, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I really don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I just…</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I don’t know, with this case.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: If you can, please call me. Please. I have to
go now… goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: I mean, you known this city. You’ve been here
for so long.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: It’s a hard place.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: I don’t sleep very well.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I feel strange being here with you…
without David knowing.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: I’m sorry, I only…</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Perfect example.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: You have to put blinders on sometimes.
Most times.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: I don’t know why I asked you to come.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Talk to him about it. He’ll understand if
you tell him how you feel.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: I can’t be a burden, especially now. I know
I’ll get used to things. I guess I wanted to know what someone who’s
lived here thinks. Upstate, it was a completely different environment. I
don’t know if David told you, but I teach fifth grade, or did.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: He mentioned it.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: I’ve been going to some of the schools,
looking for work, but the conditions here are… horrible.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: You should look into private schools.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: What’s really bothering you?</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: David and I are… going to have a baby.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Oh, Tracy… I have to tell you, I’m not the
one to talk to about this.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: I hate this city.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: If you’re thinking… I had a relationship
once, very much like a marriage. And, she was going to have our child.
This is a long time ago. She and I had decided we were going to make the
choice together… whether to keep the baby.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Well, I got up one morning and went to
work… just like any other day, except it was my first since hearing
about the baby. And, I… I felt this fear and anxiety washing over me. I
looked around, and I thought, how can we raise a child surrounded by all
this? How can a child grow up here? So, that night, I told her I didn’t
want us to have it, and over the next few weeks, I convinced her it was
wrong. I mean… I wore her down, slowly.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: I want to have children. It’s just…</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I can tell you now, I know… I’m positive I
made the right decision. I’m positive. But, there’s never a day that
passes that I don’t wish I had decided differently.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: If you… don’t keep the baby, if that’s
what you decide, then, never tell him you were pregnant. I mean that.
Never. The relationship will whither and die.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: But, if you do decide to have the baby,
then, at that very moment, when you’re absolutely sure, tell David. Tell
him at that exact second, and then spoil that kid every chance you
get.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: That’s all the advice I can give you,
Tracy. I don’t even know you.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: William…</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Keep in touch after you’re gone, William.
Please.</p>
<p><strong>wild bill</strong>: Yeah, he picked it up last night.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: This was definitely him?</p>
<p><strong>wild bill</strong>: Yeah, John Doe. Easy name to
remember.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: What was this job you did for him?</p>
<p><strong>wild bill</strong>: I got a picture of it here. It’s a real
sweet piece…</p>
<p><strong>wild bill</strong>: I figured he must be one of those
performance artists. That’s what I figured. Like one of those guys who
pisses in a cup on stage and drinks it. Performance art.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Oh… give me a break.</p>
<p><strong>wild bill</strong>: I think I undercharged him.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: You built this for him? Youbuild this?</p>
<p><strong>wild bill</strong>: I’ve built weirder shit than that. So
what?</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Detectives… we have a situation.</p>
<p><strong>wild bill</strong>: Hey, my picture… !</p>
<p><strong>wild bill</strong>: Fucking pigs.</p>
<p><strong>bald man</strong>: Just wait! Just wait!</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Get out of the fucking booth!</p>
<p><strong>bald man</strong>: Just wait! I’ll come out, just wait!</p>
<p><strong>third cop</strong>: I don’t want to go in there again.</p>
<p><strong>crazed man</strong>: He… he… he made me do it!</p>
<p><strong>second attendant</strong>: I have to look at you. I have to
look at you!</p>
<p><strong>first attendant</strong>: You’re not going to want to see
this more than once.</p>
<p><strong>crazed man</strong>: He had a gun! He made me do it!</p>
<p><strong>second attendant</strong>: He’s in shock, man. He’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>crazed man</strong>: Take this thing off me… take it off!
Please, take this thing off me!</p>
<p><strong>crazed man</strong>: Get it off… oh, God!</p>
<p><strong>sweating cop</strong>: You’re the detectives, right? Right?
Well, you’d better see this!</p>
<p><strong>sweating cop</strong>: Hey… you better see what’s strapped
onto this guy!</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: We’ve already seen it!</p>
<p><strong>crazed man</strong>: And… and… and he said… he asked me if I
was married. And, I could see he had a gun in his hand.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Where was the girl?</p>
<p><strong>crazed man</strong>: What? What?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Where was the prostitute? Where was
she?</p>
<p><strong>crazed man</strong>: She was… she was on the bed. She was
just sitting on the bed.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Who tied her down? You or him?</p>
<p><strong>crazed man</strong>: He had a gun. He had a gun… and he made
it happen. He made me do it! He made me put that… that thing on. Oh,
Christ! He made me wear it… and… and he told me to fuck her. He had the
gun in my mouth.</p>
<p><strong>crazed man</strong>: The gun was in my throat!</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: You didn’t hear any screams? Nothing? You
didn’t notice when this man walked in with a package under his arm?!</p>
<p><strong>bald man</strong>: No, I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: You didn’t notice anything wrong? Nothing
seemed strange to you?</p>
<p><strong>bald man</strong>: Everybody who goes in there has a package
under his arm. Some guys are carrying suitcases full of stuff. And,
screams? There’re screams coming out of there everyday. It goes with the
territory, little boy!</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: You like what you do for a living? You like
the things you see?</p>
<p><strong>bald man</strong>: No. No, I don’t. But, that’s life.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: The irony is, after a day of the type of
work he did, he’d come home and read me these morbid crime stories.
Murders in the Rue Morgue. Le Fanu’s Green Tea. My mother would give him
hell because he was keeping me up till all hours.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Sounds like a father who wanted his son to
follow in his footsteps.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: One birthday he gave me this brand new
hardcover book, “The Century of the Detective,” by Jurgen Thorwald. It
traced the history of deduction as a science, and it sealed my fate,
because it was real, not fiction. And, that a drop of blood or a piece
of hair could solve a crime… it was incredible to me.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: You know… there’s not going to be a happy
ending to this. It’s not possible anymore.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: If we get him, I’ll be happy enough.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: No. Face it now. Stop thinking it’s good
guys against bad guys.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: How can you say that? Especially after
today?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Don’t try to focus on things as black and
white, because you’ll go blind. There’s no winning and losing here.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: You’re the oldest man I know, Somerset.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: You tell me, then… you walk into an
apartment, and a man has beaten his wife to death, or the wife murdered
the husband, and you have to wash the blood off their children. You put
the killer in jail. Who won?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: You do your job…</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Where’s the victory?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: You follow the law and do the best you can.
It’s all there.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Just know that in this case there’s not
going to be any satisfaction. If we caught John Doe and he were the
devil himself, if it turned out he were actually Satan, then, that might
live up to our expectations. No human being could do these things,
right? But, this is not the devil. It’s just a man.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Why don’t you shut the fuck up for a while?
You bitch and complain… if I thought like you, I would have slit my
wrist already.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: You think you’re preparing me for the hard
times ahead? You think you’re toughening me up? Well, you’re not! You’re
quitting, fine… but I’m staying.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: People don’t want a champion. They just
want to keep playing the lottery and eating hamburgers.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: What the fuck is wrong with you? What burnt
you out?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: It wasn’t one thing, if that’s what you
mean. I just… I can’t live here anymore. I can’t live where stupidity is
embraced and nurtured as if it were a virtue.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Oh, you’re so much better than everyone,
right? No one’s worthy of you.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Wrong! I sympathize completely, because if
you can’t win… then, if you don’t ignore everything and everyone around
you, you… you become like John Doe. It’s easier to beat a child than it
is to raise it, because it takes so much work to love. You just have to
make sure you don’t stop to think about the abuse, and the damage,
because you’ll risk being sad. Keep ignoring.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: You’re talking about people who are mentally
ill. You’re…</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: No I’m not! I’m talking about common,
everyday life here. If you let yourself worry about one thing, you’ll
worry about the next, and the next, and it never ends. In this place,
ignorance isn’t just bliss, it’s a matter of survival.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Listen to yourself. You say, “the problem
with people is they don’t care, so I don’t care about people.” But,
you’re already here. You’ve been here a long time. So, there’s a part of
you that knows, even if everything you say is true, none of it
matters.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: That part of me is dead.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: You want me to agree with you: “Yeah, you’re
right, Somerset. This is a fucked place. Let’s go live in a fucking log
cabin.” Well, I don’t agree with you. You’re giving up, and it makes me
sick, because you’re the best I’ve ever seen.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Thanks for the beer.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Honey?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>gil</strong>: He really did a number on her, didn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Sleeping pills.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: You see what he did?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: He cut her up and dressed the wounds.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Call for help, and you’ll live. But,
you’ll be disfigured. Or, put yourself out of your misery.</p>
<p><strong>o’neill</strong>: He cut off her nose to spite her face, and
he did it very recently.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I’ve decided to stay on this, till it’s
over. Till it’s either done or we can both see it’s never going to
finish.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Oh, you want to stay now?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: One of two things will happen. We’re
either going to get John Doe, or he’ll finish his series of seven, and
this case will go on for years.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: You think you’re doing me a big favor by
staying?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I’m requesting you keep me on as your
partner a few more days. You’d be doing me the favor.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: You knew I’d say yes.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: No, actually, I wasn’t sure at all.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: As soon as this is over, I’m gone.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Big surprise.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Mills and Somerset are on the premises.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Wonder-fucking-ful.</p>
<p><strong>plain clothes cop</strong>: Your wife called this morning. Do
us a favor and get yourself an answering machine, how bout it?</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: I know you.</p>
<p><strong>uniformed cop</strong>: It’s him!</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Get down. Get down on the floor.</p>
<p><strong>another cop</strong>: You heard him, fuckface. Get down!</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Be careful!</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Down! Face on the floor!</p>
<p><strong>one cop</strong>: Spread your legs and get your hands out in
front of you!</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Don’t move. Don’t move an inch.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I don’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: What the fuck is this… ?</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: I want to speak to my lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: He cuts off the skin if his fingertips.
That’s why we can’t find a single usable print in the apartment. He’s
been doing it for quite a while. Keeps cutting before the papillary line
can grow back.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: What about the trace on his bank account and
the guns? There must be something to connect him with a past.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: So far it’s all dead ends. No credit
history. No employment history. His bank account’s only five years old
and it started as cash. We’re even trying to trace his furniture, but
for now all we know is he’s independently wealth, well educated and
totally insane. We may never know how he got that way.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Because he is John Doe, by choice.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: When do we get to question him?</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: You don’t. It goes to court now.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: He wouldn’t just turn himself in. It doesn’t
make any sense.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Well, there he sits. It’s not supposed to
make sense.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: He’s not finished.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: He’s pissing in our faces again and we’re
just taking it.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: You’re wound too tight, Mills. Let it
go.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: You know he’s fucking us.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: You and I are, probably for the first time
ever, in total agreement. He wouldn’t just stop.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Well… what the fuck, man?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: He’s only two murders away from finishing
his masterpiece, right? Can you even conceive of what’s going to happen
next? I mean, can you even imagine how he’ll try to finish it?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I can tell you this. I recognize his
lawyer. His name’s Mark Swarr.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: He’s the one who got Victor out. We’ll
wait for John Doe’s plea.</p>
<p><strong>swarr</strong>: My client says there are two more bodies… two
more victims, hidden away. He will take Detectives Mills and Somerset to
these bodies, but only Detectives Mills and Somerset. Only at six
o’clock today.</p>
<p><strong>talbot</strong>: Oh, Christ.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Why us?</p>
<p><strong>swarr</strong>: He says he admires you.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: My client claims that if the detectives do
not accept this offer, these two bodies will never be found.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Frankly, counselor, I’m inclined to let
them rot.</p>
<p><strong>talbot</strong>: We don’t make deals, Mr. Swarr.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: How is it working for a scumbag like this?
You proud of yourself?</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Ease back, Mills.</p>
<p><strong>swarr</strong>: I’m required by law to serve my clients to
the best of my ability, and to serve their best interests.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Well, we’re going to have to pass.</p>
<p><strong>swarr</strong>: My client… he also wishes to inform you, if
you do not accept, he will plead insanity, across the board.</p>
<p><strong>talbot</strong>: Let him try! I’d like to see him try!</p>
<p><strong>swarr</strong>: Come now, Martin. We all know, with the
extreme nature of these crimes, I could get him off with such a
plea.</p>
<p><strong>talbot</strong>: I’m not letting this conviction slide, I can
tell you that right here and right now!</p>
<p><strong>swarr</strong>: He says, if you accept, under his specific
conditions, he will sign a full confession and plead guilty… right here,
right now.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I’m in.</p>
<p><strong>swarr</strong>: It has to be both of you.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: If he were to claim insanity, this
conversation is admissible. The fact that he’s blackmailing us with his
plea…</p>
<p><strong>swarr</strong>: And, my client reminds you, two more are
dead. The press would have a field day if they found out the police
didn’t seem too concerned about finding them… giving them a proper
burial.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: If there really are two more dead.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: The lab report came up from downtown, They
did a quickie on Doe’s clothing and fingernails. They found blood from
Doe, from him cutting his own fingers… there was blood from the woman
whose face he cut off, and blood from a third party. As yet
unidentified.</p>
<p><strong>talbot</strong>: You would be escorting an unarmed man.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Let’s finish it.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Well… get the fucking lawyer out of the
room and we can talk about how this whole thing’s going to go down.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: If John Doe’s head splits open and a
U.F.O. flies out, I want you to have expected it.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I will.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: If I were to accidentally cut off one of my
nipple, would that be covered by workman’s compensation?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I suppose so. If you were man enough to
actually file the claim, I’d buy you a new one out of my own pocket.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Listen, Somerset… I uh…</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Well, I have to tell you… I think I’ve fallen
in love with you.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Slut.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Kiss me on the lips.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Give me a break.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Stay as cold as ice.</p>
<p><strong>california</strong>: Is this wind going to hurt us?</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Just makes the ride more fun.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Who are you, John? Who are you really?</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I mean, at this point, what would it hurt
if you told us a little about yourself?</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: It doesn’t matter who I am. Who I am means
absolutely nothing. You need to turn left here… at the traffic
light.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Where we headed?</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: You’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: We’re not just going to pick up two more
bodies, are we, Johnny? That wouldn’t be… shocking enough. Wouldn’t keep
you on the front page of the newspapers.</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: Wanting people to pay attention, you can’t
just tap them on the shoulder. You have to hit them in the head with a
sledgehammer. Then, you have their strict attention.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: What makes you so special that people should
pay attention?</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: Not me. I’m not special. I’m not
exceptional. This is, though. What I’m doing.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I hate to burst your bubble, but other than
the fact that you’re especially sadistic, there’s nothing unusual about
these precious murders of yours.</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: You know that’s not true.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: In two months, no one’s going to even
remember this happened.</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: You can’t see the whole… the whole
complete act yet. Not yet. But, when this is done, it’s going to be… so…
so…</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Spit it out.</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: It’s going to be flawless. People will
barely be able to comprehend it. It will seem almost surreal… but it
will have a tangible reality, so they won’t be able to deny it.</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: I can’t wait for you to see. I can’t wait…
It’s really going to be something.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Well, I’ll be standing beside you the whole
time, so you be sure to let me know when this whole, complete reality
thing is done. Wouldn’t want to miss it.</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: Oh, don’t worry. You won’t…</p>
<p><strong>california</strong>: Head over the bridge and keep them in
sight. Just keep your distance.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: What’s so exciting?</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: It’s not too far away now.</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: I… I doubt I enjoyed it any more than…
Detective Mills would enjoy some time alone with me in a room without
windows. Isn’t that true? How happy would it make you to hurt me, with
impunity?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Now… I wouldn’t do something like that,
Johnny. I like you. I like you a lot.</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: You wouldn’t because you know there are
consequences. It’s in those eyes of yours, though… nothing wrong with a
man taking pleasure in his work. I won’t deny my own personal desire to
turn each sin against the sinner. I only took their sins to logical
conclusions.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: You only killed a bunch of innocent people so
you could get your rocks off. That’s all.</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: Innocent? Is that supposed to be funny?
Look at the people I killed. An obese man, a disgusting man who could
barely stand up… who if you saw him on the street, you’d point so your
friends could mock him along with you. Who if you saw him while you were
eating, you wouldn’t be able to finish your meal. After him I picked the
lawyer. And, you both must have been secretly thanking me for that one.
This was a man who dedicated his life to making money by lying with
every breath he could muster… to keeping rapists and murderers on the
streets.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Murderers?</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: A woman…</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Murderers like you?</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: A woman… so ugly on the inside that she
couldn’t bare to go on living if she couldn’t be beautiful on the
outside. A drug dealer… a drug dealing pederast, actually. And, don’t
forget the disease spreading whore. Only in a world this shitty could
you even try to say these were innocent people and keep a straight face.
That’s the point. You see a deadly sin on almost every street corner,
and in every home, literally. And we tolerate it. Because it’s common,
it seems trivial, and we tolerate, all day long, morning, noon and
night. Not anymore. I’m setting the example, and it’s going to be
puzzled over and studied and followed, from now on.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Delusions of grandeur.</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: You should be thanking me.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: And, why is that?</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: You’re going to be remembered, and it’s
all because of me. And, the only reason I’m here right now is because I
wanted to be.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: We would have gotten you eventually.</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: Really? Just biding your time, then?
Toying with me. Is that it? Letting five people die until you finally
felt like going out and hauling me in?</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: Tell me what it was that gave me away.
What was the piece of evidence you were going to use against me right
before I walked up to YOU and put my hands in the air.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I seem to remember knocking on your door.</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: And, I remember breaking your nose. You’re
only alive because I didn’t kill you.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Sit back.</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: I spared you, and you’re going to have to
remember that every time you look in the mirror at that nose on your
face for the rest of your life. Or, I should say, for the rest of what
life I’ve allowed you to have.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I said, sit back, freak. Sit back and shut
your fucking mouth!</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: Don’t ask me to pity the people I killed.
I don’t mourn them anymore than I mourn the thousands who died in Sodom
and Gomorrah.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: You fuck. You really think what you did was
God’s good work?</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: The Lord works in mysterious ways.</p>
<p><strong>california</strong>: There ain’t no ambush out here. There
ain’t no fucking nothing out here.</p>
<p><strong>california</strong>: Go high. Way up. In sixty seconds, cut
to the west.</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: I didn’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: What are you looking for?</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: I want to know.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Just keep leading the way.</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: It’s close.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Mills!</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Stay with him.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Wait!</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: There’s no time to discuss it!</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: There he goes.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: There’s a van… coming down the industrial
road. Coming from the east.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Just get ready for anything and wait for
my signal. Wait for me.</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: It’s good we have some time to talk.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Get down. Get down on your knees!</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Stop the van! Stop!</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Get out! Get out with your hands on your
head! Do it now!</p>
<p><strong>deliveryman</strong>: Jesus Christ, man, don’t shoot me!</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Turn around. Hands on your head!</p>
<p><strong>deliveryman</strong>: What the hell’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Who are you? What are you doing out
here?</p>
<p><strong>deliveryman</strong>: I’m… I’m just delivering a package.</p>
<p><strong>california</strong>: Motherfucker.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Let’s do it.</p>
<p><strong>california</strong>: No! Wait for Somerset!</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: When I said I admired you… I meant what I
said. I do admire you.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>deliveryman</strong>: This guy paid me five hundred bucks to
bring it out here. He wanted it here at exactly seven o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Put it down. Put it on the ground.</p>
<p><strong>deliveryman</strong>: Okay…</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Go. Get out of here!</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: There’s a package here. It’s from John
Doe.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I don’t know… I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: I wish I could have been a normal man like
you. I wish I could have a simple life.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: What the fuck is going on here?!</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>california</strong>: We are going to wait!</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Get up. Stand up! Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: You’ve made a good life for yourself…</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Oh, fuck, no…</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Listen… listen to me. Whatever you do…
don’t come in here. Stay away. No matter what you hear, do not move in!
John Doe has the upper hand.</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: Here he comes.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: What the fuck is going on?</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: I want you to know, I wish I could have
lived like you do.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Mills… put down your gun! Throw it
away!</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Throw your gun down now!</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: What are you talking about? What
happened?</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: Are you listening to me, Detective Mills?
I’m trying to tell you how much I admire you… and your pretty wife
Tracy.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Throw your weapon, detective! Now!</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: It’s surprising how easily a member of the
press can purchase information from the men in your precinct.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: David… please…</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: I visited your home this morning, after
you left.</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: I tried to play husband… tried to taste
the life of a simple man, but it didn’t work out. So, I took a
souvenir.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Give me the gun.</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: Her pretty head.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Somerset…</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: Because I envy your normal life. Envy is
my sin.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Tell me it’s not true.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I can’t let you do this…</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Put your gun down!!</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Don’t do this… please…</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Put the gun down, Somerset!</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: David, listen to me…</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: He wants this! He wants you to do it!</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: Kill me.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Stop it! You stay away!</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I can’t let you do this!</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: She begged for her life, and for the life
of your baby inside her.</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: You didn’t know.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: NO!</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: How you feeling?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I can breathe withour pain now, so I guess
I feel great.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: The guys at the precinct heard you’re
getting out today. Anyway, we all chipped in…</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Thank you. Tell them, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: We figure you need all the tools you can
get to fix up that piece of shit you call a house.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Yeah, that’s true.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: They’re hoping you stop and say goodbye
before you go, but I told them not to expect it.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: It would be too hard.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: I have to get going, but… there is one more
thing.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: I don’t know if you’re going to want it. It
was down front. It’s from Mills.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: He’s being arraigned tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I read about it in the paper.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: I guess… decide for yourself. I don’t know
what it says. I’m going to go.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I’ll see you.</p>
<p><strong>you were right. you were</strong>: RIGHT ABOUT
EVERYTHING.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: There you go, Mister Somerset.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Oh… man…</p>
