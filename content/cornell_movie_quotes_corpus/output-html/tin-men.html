<h1 id="tin-men">tin-men</h1>
<p><strong>1 ext. cadillac dealership - day 1</strong>: BILL BABOWSKY ,
a wiry, dapper-looking man in his mid-thirties, is circling a baby blue
Cadillac. A SALESMAN follows on his heels.</p>
<p><strong>salesman</strong>: She’s a beauty.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>salesman</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Who’s the beauty?</p>
<p><strong>salesman</strong>: The car.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: I thought maybe you saw some chick walking by. I
lost my concentration. Why do they call cars ‘she’? They never say ‘he’…
always ‘she.’</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Very nice… very nice.</p>
<p><strong>2 ext. neighborhood - line of row houses - day 2</strong>: We
hear YELLING.</p>
<p><strong>3 int. row house - day 3</strong>: NORA, a rather plain, but
attractive woman in her early 30’s, is yelling up the stairs.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: You’re a sick man! Sick! Do ya hear me?! Do ya
hear me?!</p>
<p><strong>3 continued: 3</strong>: Peeking around the bannister from
the second floor is ERNEST TILLEY, also in his 30’s, handsome in a
boyish way.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Who’s sick?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Who do ya think I’m screaming at? How many of
you are there up there? There’s only you, and you’re a sick human
being.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Where’s my white on white shirt? The nice
one, you know.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: It’s like yelling through a wall to you. I’m
carrying on about what a disgusting human being you are, and all you
want to know is where your white on white shirt is.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Yes, the one with the permanent stays.</p>
<p><strong>4 ext. cadillac dealership - day 4</strong>: BB is now
sitting in a cubicle in the office with the Salesman, going over the
contract on the car.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Now don’t try to hustle me here … you know what
I mean. I hate being hustled. Give me an honest price, not one of your
‘special’ deals… give me an honest price. Do I make myself clear?</p>
<p><strong>salesman</strong>: Now, how much are you willing to pay?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: There ya go… there ya go… you’re doing it…
you’re doing one of those hustle numbers.</p>
<p><strong>salesman</strong>: I’m just trying to get an idea how much
you’re willing to pay.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Four dollars… I want to pay four dollars a
month.</p>
<p><strong>salesman</strong>: That’s not an honest answer.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: What do ya want to hear? That I’d love to pay
three hundred and fifty a month… is that what you want to hear? Tell me
how much you want me to pay and I’ll tell you how much I’ll pay, but
don’t do a hustle on me… I don’t like that. How much do I want to pay?
I’d like to pay nothing!</p>
<p><strong>5 ext. tilley’s house - day 5</strong>: Tilley’s leaving the
house with his tie undone around his white on white shirt. He carries
his sports jacket, and Nora is standing at the door yelling at him.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: You’re being unreasonable. You don’t even want
to listen.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: I don’t know what I did… I got no idea. If
it’s my fault, I’m sorry… I’m sorry. I can do no better than that. A
full unconditional apology.</p>
<p><strong>6 ext. cadillac dealership - day 6</strong>: BB and the
Salesman are coming out of the office.</p>
<p><strong>salesman</strong>: If you even have the smallest problem,
call me personally and I’ll just shoot you straight into the service
department.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: And I get a loaner if the car’s got to stay?</p>
<p><strong>salesman</strong>: As we discussed, you get a car if the car
has to be kept overnight.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: I get a loaner?</p>
<p><strong>7 int. tilley’s car - day 7</strong>: He drives along,
mumbling to himself.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: She’s gonna drive me to my grave… I’m headed
to my grave… the woman’s driving me insane… it’s not supposed to happen
this way.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: It’s not even eleven o’clock and my neck is
stiffening up.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: My neck’s tight… it’s tight.</p>
<p><strong>8 ext. cadillac dealership - day 8</strong>: BB gets into the
shiny, baby-blue Cadillac, puts it in reverse and starts to back out of
the car lot.</p>
<p><strong>9 int. tilley’s car - day 9</strong>: Tilley is doing neck
exercises, rolling his head from left to right as he drives. He sees a
red light ahead and starts to slow down, continuing to roll his
head.</p>
<p><strong>10 ext. bb’s cadillac - day 10</strong>: BB sees the light is
red and starts to back into the street.</p>
<p><strong>11 int. tilley’s car - day 11</strong>: Tilley rolls his head
back as he slows to 15 miles an hour.</p>
<p><strong>12 ext. bb’s cadillac - day 12</strong>: BB backs into the
street thinking that Tilley’s car is going to stop.</p>
<p><strong>13 int. tilley’s car - day 13</strong>: Tilley is still
rolling his head.</p>
<p><strong>14 ext. street - day 14</strong>: Tilley’s Cadillac and BB’s
Cadillac CRASH into one another. The entire right rear of BB’s shiny,
baby-blue Cadillac is smashed. Both men are shocked and momen- tarily
confused. After a beat, both Tilley and BB bolt from their cars. Tilley
looks at his buckled hood. BB races up to Tilley’s face.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Are you a lunatic? Can’t you see I’m trying to
back out of this lot? There’s a red light, you shoulda stopped.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Me? What are you, crazy? You just want to
back into the middle of the street like that. A man’s just driving along
and you back into the middle of the street. What kind of driving is
that? What kind of driving?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: There’s a red light, I’m making a space for
myself… that’s what I’m doing, in order to get into the street… that’s
something ya do!</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: You came out of nowhere… you bolted out of
no place… bolted out of nowhere.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Bolted! At six miles an hour I’m bolting into
the street! You schmuck! You schmuck!</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Back away from me, do ya hear me? Back away
from me.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Back away? You want me to back away? I’ll back
away.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: You’re a fucking lunatic!</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: You’re a madman! Smashes into me, attacks me…
the man is crazy!</p>
<p><strong>man #1</strong>: Come on now, calm down, calm down.</p>
<p><strong>man #2</strong>: Take it easy… take it easy…</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Get this guy! Will ya get this guy? Backs in
front of me, and then kicks my headlight in… and I’m crazy. You
lunatic!</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: You’re going to prison. Death! Death! They’re
going to give you death!</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Car only has one sixteenth of a mile, and I’ve
been hit.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: I’m gonna get even with you, you son of a bitch…
I’m gonna get even with you. This is no ordinary traffic accident.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: You want to drive a Cadillac, learn how to
drive. You want to get even with somebody? You picked the wrong person
to get even with. Nobody backs into traffic, smashes my car and says
they want to get even. I’m gonna get even!</p>
<p><strong>15 int. diner - day 15</strong>: Seated at a booth are three
aluminum siding salesmen having their late morning breakfast. SAM
PICKLES, a heavyset man in his 50’s, delicately butters his toast, and
is shaking his head sadly.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Did ya see ‘Bonanza’ last night? Can you tell
me why Ben Cartwright had a colored guy stay over?</p>
<p><strong>15 continued: 15</strong>: GIL, who is pouring half a pound
of sugar into his coffee, looks up.</p>
<p><strong>gil</strong>: Ben Cartwright had a colored guy stay overnight
at the Ponderosa?</p>
<p><strong>mouse</strong>: Did he know this guy personally?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: No… he was just passing through, asked if he
could stay over, and Ben Cartwright said ‘sure thing.’ It doesn’t make
any sense… he invites a strange colored guy in… invited him in to stay.
Is that crazy or what? If a colored guy came to my door and said ‘can I
stay the night,’ I’d tell him ‘get the fuck out of here’! It’s nothing
personal, mind you.</p>
<p><strong>mouse</strong>: You’re not a bigot, is that what you’re
telling us?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Me? No, I’m not a bigot.</p>
<p><strong>gil</strong>: If you’re not, how come you’re making such a
big thing out of it?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: It’s the fact the Ben Cartwright’s on the
Ponderosa… he’s in the middle of nowhere. It’s not like he’s living on
Reisterstown Road with houses all around… we’re talking about the West
here. It’s the idea that a strange guy comes to the door in the middle
of the West. It doesn’t make sense, that’s all I’m saying.</p>
<p><strong>mouse</strong>: Come on… you’re a bigot, that’s what you
are.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Listen, I’ll sell tin to anybody … I don’t care
who he is. A mark’s a mark, whether he’s Chinese, Indian or from Mars…
I’m thoroughly integrated. Makes no difference to me… I just wouldn’t
have one of those guys sleep in my house.</p>
<p><strong>17 int. diner - day 17</strong>: He starts walking to the
booth where the other tin men are. On his way he yells over to the
waitress.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Florence, eggs and the toast, the way I like
it.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Not too gooey. Coffee right away.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I just don’t believe that ‘Bonanza’ is an
accurate description of the West. I say no more.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Come on, give me a couple of more
inches.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You want me to take my plate… I’ll eat in the
parking lot.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Come on, Sam, I’m having a terrible morning.
You’re not going to believe this, some guy just crashed into me… right
in the middle of the street… then he attacks me. One of the loonies.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Did ya live?</p>
<p><strong>mouse</strong>: Did you get his name?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Yeah, I got his name. The police came… God,
I can’t believe it… the guy’s an idiot.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Yeah, here it is… some Polish name…
Babowski… Bill Babowski … fucking son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>gil</strong>: I know the guy… they call him</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: You know the son of a bitch?</p>
<p><strong>gil</strong>: Yeah, he works with Bagel.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: He sells aluminum siding? I don’t believe
it… of all the people that could run into me, it has to be a fucking tin
man. How come I don’t know him?</p>
<p><strong>gil</strong>: You musta seen him. He hangs out with Carly
Benelli, Cheese … you know, that group.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: I don’t know the guy.</p>
<p><strong>gil</strong>: Don’t you remember, he was up at the Corral one
night when we were there… he’s a good dancer. You must have seen
him.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: I don’t know the guy.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Gil, he doesn’t know the guy.</p>
<p><strong>gil</strong>: I thought he knew him, Sam… I can’t believe he
doesn’t know him.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: He seems to be indicating that he doesn’t know
him.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: I don’t know the guy!</p>
<p><strong>gil</strong>: He’s a good dancer.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: What do you want me to do, date him? What do
I give a shit if he’s a good dancer?</p>
<p><strong>gil</strong>: I thought you saw him. I was amazed, he does a
Marengay… I tell you if I was a girl I’d be impressed.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You’re not a girl and you’re impressed!</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Is it fresh?</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Yes, it’s fresh!</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Just asking, Florence.</p>
<p><strong>17 continued: 17</strong>: Florence starts to walk away.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: You’re always just asking.</p>
<p><strong>gil</strong>: I’m telling you, you just can’t believe how
well this guy does the Marengay.</p>
<p><strong>mouse</strong>: I can’t wait to see it.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: I’ll tell you one thing, when I get a hold
of this guy, I’ll break both his legs and then he won’t dance the
Marengay too good.</p>
<p><strong>18 ext. industrial park in a run-down area of town -
day18</strong>: We see BB pulling up to a building in his banged-up,
brand new Cadillac. There are three or four nice Cadillacs parked
outside of the run-down building.</p>
<p><strong>girl #1</strong>: Good morning, I represent the Superior
Aluminum Siding Company. We will have a representative in your
neighborhood today. Would you be interested in seeing the benefits of
our aluminum product?</p>
<p><strong>girl #1</strong>: Yes… well, we do aluminum siding which
improves the appearance of your house, and improves the insulation…</p>
<p><strong>girl #2</strong>: … Which improves the appearance of your
house, and improves the insulation…</p>
<p><strong>girl #3</strong>: … Superior Aluminum Siding Company. We will
have a representative…</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: So the guy goes to the doctor for a physical…
they do all those tests, all that stuff, blah, blah, blah…</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: … Doctor says ‘when we get all the information
back, we’ll give you a call.’ Leaves the doctor. One day the telephone
rings… the guy goes and picks it up.</p>
<p><strong>cheese</strong>: The guy?</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: The guy!</p>
<p><strong>cheese</strong>: Not the doctor?</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: That’s right, the guy picks it up. He gets a
phone call… it’s the doctor on the line. Doctor says ‘I’ve got some bad
news and some worse news.’</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: Guy says ‘Well, let me hear the bad news
first.’ ‘The bad news is, you’ve got twenty-four hours to live.’ The guy
says ‘What’s the worse news?’ Doctor says ‘I forgot to call you
yesterday.’</p>
<p><strong>looney</strong>: It’s good… I like it.</p>
<p><strong>cheese</strong>: I never heard bad news and worse news… smart
joke.</p>
<p><strong>looney</strong>: Yeah… I like it.</p>
<p><strong>carly</strong>: It’s dumb, but good.</p>
<p><strong>cheese</strong>: Up it fifty cents.</p>
<p><strong>looney</strong>: I call… I call. I’m in on this one… I
call.</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: We get it, you’re calling.</p>
<p><strong>carly</strong>: I’m not sure.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Stay with him.</p>
<p><strong>carly</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>cheese</strong>: Carly, get out of the hand… I’m holding
serious cards. Very serious cards.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: He’s bluffing.</p>
<p><strong>cheese</strong>: If I’m lying, I’m dying.</p>
<p><strong>carly</strong>: I’m out.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Ballsy move.</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: Did you get the new Cadillac?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Yeah. It’s already been hit.</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Didn’t have it five minutes, backing out of the
place, and a guy comes out of nowhere and bangs into my car.</p>
<p><strong>looney</strong>: So, what ya got?</p>
<p><strong>cheese</strong>: Pair of sixes.</p>
<p><strong>looney</strong>: Jacks. Win.</p>
<p><strong>carly</strong>: Shit! Pair of sixes.</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: How much damage?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: I bet it’s six hundred bucks.</p>
<p><strong>looney</strong>: Six hundred bucks? I’d get rid of the car.
That much damage it won’t be any good. You may have dented the
frame.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: I didn’t dent the frame.</p>
<p><strong>looney</strong>: When you hit the frame, the car doesn’t ride
right.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: He didn’t hit the frame! I’ll tell you this, I’m
gonna get the son of a bitch. If he would have apologized or something,
but this guy gets out, tries to push me around.</p>
<p><strong>cheese</strong>: You’re kidding me?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Yeah… the guy’s totally off the wall.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: I’m gonna get him… just for the fun of it.</p>
<p><strong>20 ext. lower/middle class neighborhood - day 20</strong>:
BB’s Cadillac moves through the neighborhood, and we see homes that all
look to be about 30 to 40 years old.</p>
<p><strong>21 int. bb’s cadillac - day 21</strong>: Moe is with BB in
the Cadillac. BB is driving. Moe is looking through some papers.</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: Now, let me see… we gotta be at the Hickey
house at four. It’s about three-twenty now… we’ve got some time on our
hands. You want to get some coffee?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: No, I’m up to here with the coffee.</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: They got any good pool halls around here?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: I don’t know. You know what would be fun to
do..? Let’s try the Life Magazine routine.</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>22 ext. wooden framed house - day 22</strong>: Slightly
run-down. We’re looking THROUGH the LENS of a 35mm camera.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: You know, I think we’ve got to come over about
two feet.</p>
<p><strong>23 int. wooden framed house - day 23</strong>: A HOUSEWIFE is
looking through the curtains, suspiciously. CAMERA MOVES TOWARDS the
window and we see Moe and BB moving the 35mm camera around on a tripod.
We can faintly hear their talk.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: I think this is a better position… the light is
hitting it, which is accentuating the effect we’re going for. It’s very
good… very good.</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: This shows the flaws in the structure…</p>
<p><strong>24 ext. wooden framed house - day 24</strong>: BB and Moe at
the camera and tripod.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: She’s at the window.</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: This is going to be terrific in Life Magazine.
Terrific in Life Magazine! Come on outside, honey.</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: This should be our single biggest issue of Life
Magazine.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Bingo!</p>
<p><strong>housewife</strong>: Excuse me. What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: Oh, I hope we’re not disturbing you, ma’am.
We’re with Life Magazine… we’ll be out of here in just a minute.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Move the tripod another foot… another foot.</p>
<p><strong>housewife</strong>: What do you mean, Life Magazine?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Two minutes, ma’am, and we’ll be out of here. We
just need the picture for Life Magazine, and we’ll be out of here.</p>
<p><strong>housewife</strong>: Life Magazine? I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: It’s very simple. Ya know, we’re doing this
layout about the benefits of aluminum siding – a ‘before’ and ‘after’
kind of presentation.</p>
<p><strong>housewife</strong>: A ‘before’ picture?</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: So they see your house, and another one done
with aluminum siding… the other house looking so much more
beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>housewife</strong>: In Life Magazine?</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: It’s a special issue on home improvements and
ways to beautify your home.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: A wonderful issue… it’s one of the finest
pictorial things we’ve done here at Life… the ways you can improve your
house. We’re gonna be out of here in no time, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: It’s gonna look very good, BB.</p>
<p><strong>housewife</strong>: My house is going to be the ‘before’?
Can’t mine be like the ‘after’?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: No, no… we’ve got a house that looked like yours
and it’s been done in aluminum… it’s very nice.</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: Yeah… really shows the contrast of what a house
can look like.</p>
<p><strong>housewife</strong>: What does it cost?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: What? The aluminum siding? Oh… I don’t know the
figures offhand. Do you have any idea, Moe?</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: I think it’s fairly reasonable.</p>
<p><strong>housewife</strong>: Could my house be the ‘after’ in Life
Magazine and you get another house for the ‘before.’</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: You mean have your house as the ‘after’ and find
another house that looks like your house for the ‘before’?</p>
<p><strong>housewife</strong>: Is it possible?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: What do ya think, Moe? Would that be
ethical?</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: Well, we didn’t sign any agreement with the
‘after’ house. We’d have to move very quickly, ma’am… you know what I
mean?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: You’d have to work out an arrangement with an
aluminum siding company and they’d have to do the job very quickly for
us to make our deadline… we’ve got a deadline, that’s the problem.</p>
<p><strong>housewife</strong>: How quickly?</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: BB, what do you think? Can we slide the
deadline, or what? Six or seven days?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Pressing it. Do you think we could manage it,
Moe?</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: It’s pushing it, BB. What time would your
husband be home, ’cos he’d have to go over the figures with the
salesman… that’s if there’s a salesman available this evening.</p>
<p><strong>housewife</strong>: He’ll be home at seven.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: We might be able to work it.</p>
<p><strong>housewife</strong>: That would be wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>25 int. wooden framed house - night 25</strong>: BB and Moe
are sitting on a sofa sipping coffee, looking as if they were members of
the family. The Housewife and her HUSBAND are sitting across the dining
room table from Carly. Carly is going through papers, adding up
figures.</p>
<p><strong>carly</strong>: Okay… we’ve got a total of thirty-seven
hundred dollars.</p>
<p><strong>husband</strong>: Thirty-seven hundred dollars?</p>
<p><strong>housewife</strong>: Honey, we’re gonna be in Life
Magazine.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Moe, did you call the office and make sure we
can hold up the issue until this job is completed? This house really
could be a showcase.</p>
<p><strong>husband</strong>: Thirty-seven hundred dollars!</p>
<p><strong>carly</strong>: I tell you what… I’ve got an idea. Do you
mind my guys working on a Saturday? ’Cos if my crew can work on Saturday
next, that’ll free my guys up on Monday. Yeah, that’ll really help me
out on another job. Anyway, if we can do that, I think I’ll be able to
knock off three hundred and fifty dollars from the job. You see, I’ve
got an overlapping situation on Monday… I don’t want to go into it. What
do ya think? We got a deal?</p>
<p><strong>husband</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>looney</strong>: What are the benefits of aluminum siding?
One: you never have to paint.</p>
<p><strong>cheese</strong>: … You have much greater insulation.</p>
<p><strong>mouse</strong>: … It cuts down on your heating bills…</p>
<p><strong>gil</strong>: So what we’ve got is efficiency and the
beautification of your home.</p>
<p><strong>30 int. house - night 30</strong>: Tilley is packing up his
sample case. A middle-aged HUSBAND and wife sit on a couch across from
him.</p>
<p><strong>husband #2</strong>: No, I’m sorry, Mr. Tilley, I just can’t
afford it.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: We haven’t even got to discussing terms.
There are so many friendly financial arrangements that would hardly be a
bite into your weekly salary.</p>
<p><strong>husband #2</strong>: No… not this time.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Well, as I said, you can always reach me…
you’ve got my card, and when the time comes, let’s talk.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Hey, give my best to your little son…
wonderful kid there. What’s his name again, Ronnie?</p>
<p><strong>husband #2</strong>: Randy.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Randy, right. Well, good night.</p>
<p><strong>31 int. cadillac - night 31</strong>: Sam is singing to the
RADIO. Tilley opens the back door and throws his sample case inside. He
gets in the driver’s seat and slams the car door angrily.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: I thought I had ’em… I was this close.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: The amount of time you spent there, I thought
you were ready to send for me to close it up.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Damn! I thought I had ’em.</p>
<p><strong>32 int. pimlico hotel - bar/restaurant - night 32</strong>:
This is a piano bar with an intimate restaurant at one end. The PIANIST
is playing “The Girl From Ipanema.”</p>
<p><strong>pianist</strong>: ‘Tall and tan and young and lovely, the
girl from Ipanema goes walking, and when she passes each one she passes
goes… “Ah!”’</p>
<p><strong>wing</strong>: Forty-six hundred dollars. This looks like a
sound deal. They own their own house… we won’t have any problem getting
the financing for them. Real good, Mouse.</p>
<p><strong>wing</strong>: So, that’s one thousand, one hundred and
thirty-eight dollars.</p>
<p><strong>mouse</strong>: Thanks, boss. Pleasure doing business with
ya.</p>
<p><strong>wing</strong>: Now, what’s your guys’ story?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Nothing again… came up short. Let me get a
little advance… three hundred, just to carry me for a bit.</p>
<p><strong>wing</strong>: Tilley, I’m already carrying you for, what is
it – twenty-three hundred? Something like that?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: No problem… just in a little slump here.</p>
<p><strong>wing</strong>: Don’t try to go walking on me.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: What do you mean, walking? You think I’m
gonna work somewhere else… you’ve been very good to me… very
honorable.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: He’s always said that about you, Wing. Always
said that about you… he has.</p>
<p><strong>wing</strong>: I’ll give you hundred and fifty.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Wing, I need a bit more than that… I got
expenses.</p>
<p><strong>wing</strong>: What’s wrong with your wife? She doesn’t
work?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Yeah, but how much is she gonna make working
at the Social Security office?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Come on, Wing, can’t you do better than
this… a man in my position in terms of this firm… I dunno…</p>
<p><strong>wing</strong>: All right, I’ll give you two hundred.</p>
<p><strong>mouse</strong>: Honey, can you get me some Marlboros and a 7
and 7?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: And some scotch, straight up.</p>
<p><strong>wing</strong>: Now listen, guys, we got a problem here.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Did she hear me say scotch straight up?</p>
<p><strong>wing</strong>: My sources tell me this Home Improvement
Commission is for real… it’s no jackpot. These guys are going to be a
real pain in the ass, so any of the scams that you guys are pulling,
they get wind of it, they take your license and it’s goodbye to this
business.</p>
<p><strong>mouse</strong>: They take away your license? They take away
your livelihood? What kind of people are these?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: They have no respect for the working man.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Which scams are they talking about? They got
a list?</p>
<p><strong>wing</strong>: Any irregularities, you know, selling a house
on the pretense that it’s a model house and every job sold in the area
they get a kickback… the Life Magazine hustle… you guys know all the
bullshit numbers we can run.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Jesus! What a pain in the ass. Do you think
this commission’s gonna stick around or is it gone with the wind?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: They take your license?</p>
<p><strong>33 ext. street - night 33</strong>: BB’s Cadillac moves along
the street.</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: I wouldn’t mind seeing Africa some time.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Not me. I don’t want to go where they’ve got
snakes.</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: They’ve got snakes?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: I’ve heard they’ve got snakes that’ll outrun a
horse through the grass. They got a snake that bites you… you got eleven
seconds to live. No thank you. I don’t want to spend my good money to
visit with that kind of jeopardy. I’d like to go to a place where… hold
it!</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: The guy who ran into me… that’s his car.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: I’ll be back, Moe. I’m gonna even the score.</p>
<p><strong>35 int. entrance lobby to pimlico hotel - night 35</strong>:
Tilley, Sam, Mouse and Gil are about to leave the hotel. They’re putting
their coats on just inside the closed door. Tilley is halfway into his
coat.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Give me eight points I take the Knicks over
the Lakers for 20.</p>
<p><strong>mouse</strong>: It’s too big a spread.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: It’s that fucking lunatic again.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Can you believe this guy? Is he sane or
what?</p>
<p><strong>mouse</strong>: Isn’t that something?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What’s he got, a gnat up his ass? What the
hell’s wrong with the guy?</p>
<p><strong>gil</strong>: Don’t you recognize him from the Corral?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: I don’t know the guy!</p>
<p><strong>gil</strong>: I’ll never forget his Marengay.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: I’ll tell you something, if Mr. Marengay
wants to play… we’ll play.</p>
<p><strong>37 int. porch of house - night 37</strong>: Tilley is letting
himself into his house. He goes into the kitchen where Nora is sitting,
drinking a cup of coffee and working on a crossword puzzle. He takes off
his coat and throws it on a chair.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: from the crossword</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Please! I’m out there working myself to the
bone, trying to make a living.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: What’s a five letter word for a Portuguese
overseas province?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Try Macao.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: M-A-C-A-O… that fits.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: What’re you doing up so late?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: We’re off tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: I think this place may be a little too large
for us.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: What are you talking about… this match
box?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: It’s got a lot of overhead to it. What do
you do… spend your time in the bedroom and the kitchen, that’s all. So
why do you need a living room and a dining room.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Why do ya need a back yard?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: You’re not selling anything?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: I’m in a slump.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: It happens.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Last year I’m number three top seller… year
before, right up there. I can’t get my momentum going this year.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Well, you will. You always do.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: I’m not sure I like the idea of all this
overhead breathing down my neck. When you have a place like this, that’s
a lot of overhead.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: What are you talking about? The monthly
payments on your Cadillac are more than this whole house. Why don’t you
get yourself something cheaper, like a Chevy?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: It doesn’t instill confidence in my clients.
Cadillac means that you’re dealing with someone of importance. I thought
I had a couple tonight… they just slipped away… slipped away. I’m gonna
take a bath – my neck’s been tight since this morning.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I’ll turn out the lights.</p>
<p><strong>38 int. tilley’s house - bathroom - night 38</strong>: Tilley
is in the tub, lathering himself. Nora enters and sits on the side of
the tub.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: You know, Tilley, we hardly ever do things
together.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Do things together that are enjoyable.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: What would we do together for it to be
enjoyable?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: If we went on a picnic… it would be fun.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: I don’t understand a picnic… we just go some
place… we put a thing on the ground, and we eat.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Yes… it’s nice to do that.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Why? I don’t get it. It’s better sitting at
home and watching TV.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I think there’s something nice about a picnic…
it’s fun.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: What’s fun about it? Ants get into the food…
there’s bees. I don’t get it. We have to drive, it takes maybe an hour
to get there, then you sit in grass and eat. Why is that fun?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I just thought it might be nice to do
something together, that’s all… thought it might be fun.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: It doesn’t sound like fun to me… you take
the stuff you’ve got here in the house, you take it someplace to eat it.
It’s just as much fun eating in front of the TV, and we do that
together, don’t we? No ants and no bees… much more comfortable.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: It’s not the same thing.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Scrub my back, will ya, Nora.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Not too hard! Don’t get me wrong, I’m
willing to do anything with you. I’m just a little stymied by a picnic.
If you want to go, send me a postcard.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: What did I say?</p>
<p><strong>39 ext. industrial park - day 39</strong>: We see Tilley’s
Cadillac cruising the streets, obviously looking for someone.</p>
<p><strong>40 int. tilley’s cadillac - day 40</strong>: Tilley is
driving with Gil in the passenger seat.</p>
<p><strong>gil</strong>: I think you make a left here.</p>
<p><strong>gil</strong>: Yeah… there it is… that’s the place… Superior
Aluminum… that’s it over there.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Okay, Mr. Marengay… here I come.</p>
<p><strong>gil</strong>: Hey, Tilley, don’t go too wild…</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: I’ll show the son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: He’ll get a lot of air… won’t be too stuffy
in this car when I’m finished.</p>
<p><strong>gil</strong>: Quick, Tilley… let’s get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>41 int. superior aluminum siding office - tight shot - day
41</strong>: Of a map of a 15 block area of Baltimore. Colored pins are
in place indicating various homes that have been provided with aluminum
siding. Another pin goes into place.</p>
<p><strong>bagel</strong>: That was a good sale, Double B. Just got a
call on a loan… we’re in business.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: We see BAGEL. He’s a little guy with
a black Fedora and baggy pants held up with suspenders. BB stands with
him.</p>
<p><strong>bagel</strong>: This whole section has been very fertile for
us.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: Moe, Looney and Carly are talking to
STANLEY FRANKS, a young guy in his early 20’s. He is dressed in the “Ivy
League” look of the times.</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: Sure you wanna get into the tin game?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Money’s good, I understand.</p>
<p><strong>looney</strong>: Lot of crazy people you’re gonna run into
when you’re knocking on those doors. Hermits that don’t see the outside
world, Jehovah’s Witnesses that try and sell you the Bible at the same
time you’re trying to sell them tin. People that are just lonely and
want to have conversations.</p>
<p><strong>carly</strong>: Every time you step in that door, you’ve got
to be fast on your feet.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Interesting.</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: What’s the best way to qualify a mark?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: How do you know if you can get the upper hand?
How do you know if you’re dealing with a guy who’s in an inferior
position to you, or superior position? How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: You just have to talk and feel your
way.</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: Quick way… get a book of matches out of your
pocket to light your cigarette… you drop the matches on the floor.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: Guy bends down to pick up the matches for you,
you got a mark… you got this guy in your pocket. If he looks to you to
pick it up, you’ve got a long, hard, tough sell on your hands.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: You want to get in good with these people… you
want to win their confidence? Good thing to try… get a five dollar bill,
take it out when the guy’s not looking, drop it on the ground. Guy looks
back, pick it up, hand it to him and say, ‘Mr. Blah blah, you musta
dropped this five dollar bill on the ground.’ Two things happen… he
says, ‘It’s not mine,’ you say, ‘Musta been, ’cos it’s certainly not
mine,’ or the guy takes it. Right away this guy is thinking you must be
one hell of a nice guy… you’re in. You start chipping away… you start
getting inside those people.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Come on, Moe, let’s split.</p>
<p><strong>looney</strong>: Yeah, we’d better go, too. Come on, Stanley.
Me and Stanley. It’s like a first date.</p>
<p><strong>42 ext. superior aluminum siding building - day 42</strong>:
BB and Moe approach BB’s Cadillac. He sees that all the windows have
been smashed in. Moe looks to BB. Looney walks up from behind.</p>
<p><strong>looney</strong>: What? You got a special bargain when you
bought this car? They come cheaper without windows?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: This guy’s looking to play tit for tat. That’s
not my game. I’m gonna play hardball.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: I’m gonna find out everything about this son of
a bitch, and then I’m gonna find the one thing that cuts him to the
quick.</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: Let’s go inside… make some calls.</p>
<p><strong>43 int. pool hall - tight shot 43</strong>: of a pool ball
ricocheting off an eight ball. The eight ball drops into the pocket.
Tilley throws down his pool stick. We see his partner is Mouse. Gil sits
in a chair against a wall.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Damn it! Damn it! I can’t believe it… I
can’t believe I did that.</p>
<p><strong>mouse</strong>: Well, then, believe it. There’s no sense not
to believe it, because you did it… so believe it. That’s twenty more…
you owe me sixty.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: You think I can’t add?</p>
<p><strong>mouse</strong>: ‘Dayo!… da, da, da, da, day. Daylight come
and he wanna go home…’</p>
<p><strong>gil</strong>: Oh, this is going to be good.</p>
<p><strong>mouse</strong>: ‘Dayo!… da, da, da, da, da, da, da.’
‘Daylight come and he wanna go home…’</p>
<p><strong>44 int. room off main pool hall 44</strong>: Sam is going
through some papers on a desk, and comes across an IRS letter addressed
to Tilley. He notices that it hasn’t been opened. He looks at the
postdate mark – it’s five weeks old, dated January 3, 1963.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Jesus Christ!</p>
<p><strong>45 int. pool hall 45</strong>: He approaches Tilley who’s
just finished racking the balls.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Tilley.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Found this on your desk while I was going over
some papers.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: From the IRS. I never even remember seeing
it. I must have left it with my other bills. I wonder what it is?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Maybe it’s a refund check.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Hum… says here that they haven’t received my
1962 taxes. They seem to be saying that they didn’t get my check for
four thousand dollars.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What? It must be a clerical error.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: I can’t believe they spend all that time and
energy to write to me… to single me out.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What are you talking about? You didn’t pay your
taxes?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: I probably forgot… people forget their taxes
all the time… just slipped my mind… I got so many things on my mind.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: I figured they could wait a few years… it’s
not like they need my money to build a bomber. You think they’re waiting
for my money before they dig a new road? Are they all sitting there
saying, ‘Well, it’s time we went to see that guy on Pimlico Road… can’t
run this government without his four thousand dollars.’ I figured they’d
give me a little leeway. I’m going to pay them… I know I’ve got a debt…
I just need a little leeway.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You can’t mess around with the government. Why
don’t you go to H &amp; R Block, they’ll take care of your taxes for
you.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: You think I’m gonna let some schmuck know
all my business… have some guy pull me over the coals for spending on
this and that. I need some privacy.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Taxes is serious stuff, Tilley.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: I can just see that schmuck in that little
tax shop telling people my business… how much I make… how much I spend…
no way!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: All I can say, is you better get a lawyer or
somebody to look into this, ’cos the IRS, they don’t fuck around.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Just what I need in my life right now… I’m
in a slump and I’ve got the IRS on me. Like when something goes wrong,
it’s like…</p>
<p><strong>46 ext. nora and tilley’s house - day 46</strong>: We see
Nora leaving her house, walking down the steps and getting into her car.
She STARTS the ENGINE and pulls away. CAMERA HOLDS for a moment, and
then INTO FRAME comes Moe’s car with BB sitting shotgun. They follow
Nora.</p>
<p><strong>47 int. small neighborhood supermarket - day 47</strong>:
Nora enters. Ten seconds later, BB enters. He pulls a shopping cart from
the stall, and follows Nora.</p>
<p><strong>angle on moe</strong>: as he walks up to the front of the
supermarket and looks through the window.</p>
<p><strong>angle on frozen food section</strong>: Nora is stopped with
her cart and is deciding on vege- tables. BB has a pile of frozen
dinners in his arms.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Are these any good do ya know? These TV
dinners?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I don’t think they’re too good for you, not a
lot of ’em anyway.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: My wife died.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Oh, I’m sorry to hear that.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: I’m over it now, but it was a very trying time…
very trying… I’ve only just started eating again.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: You know what would be a lot more healthy and
satisfying is to get yourself a chicken… just pop it in the oven for a
couple of hours with a little bit of seasoning on it. Makes a good meal,
and you can make sandwiches with the leftovers.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: But then you have to sit and watch it cook.
Something seems sad about a man sitting alone in a house and watching a
chicken cook.</p>
<p><strong>48 ext. supermarket - day 48</strong>: Moe is looking through
the window of the supermarket. From his POV we see BB and Nora. BB says
something and Nora laughs. Then Nora says something and BB laughs,
holding her arm.</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: He’s an amazing sort… he’s got the gift.</p>
<p><strong>49 ext. street - across from supermarket - day 49</strong>: A
man sits behind the wheel of a plain-looking Ford. Stanley, the new tin
man, pulls up in his car behind him, gets out and walks to the other
man’s car. He kneels down and talks to the driver of the car. There
seems to be a serious exchange but with the sound of TRAFFIC and the
cars passing THROUGH FRAME, we’re un- able to hear what is taking place.
Stanley nods, taps the side of the car, car drives off. Stanley goes
back to his car and drives off.</p>
<p><strong>50 int. modest house - day 50</strong>: Tilley is selling to
a MAN and his WIFE. The Man wears a seersucker suit and a bow tie – he
is a mousie little man, and his Wife is the female equivalent.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Thank you, Mr. Tilley. I can’t believe it… this
is the most generous thing anyone’s ever done … Swell! Like a gift from
heaven.</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: The Lord has certainly blessed us this
evening.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Well, what can I say… I’m a modest person… I
just do what I can to help.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Thanks again.</p>
<p><strong>51 ext. modest house - day 51</strong>: As the door closes
behind Tilley, he goes to where Sam’s car is parked and gets in the
passenger seat.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: So, what’s the scoop?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: We got ’em!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You’re kidding?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Take a look at this, Sam.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Are you fucking crazy? You just gave them
forty-two hundred dollars in aluminum siding free?!</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: This is the best scam I’ve ever thought of
in my whole life.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: It’s in my blood… I’m brilliant … I’m
fucking brilliant… this is such a brilliant scam… I’m beside myself.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Here it is… you go back in the house and
this is what you say…</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Mr. Tilley is crazy… he had a nervous
breakdown.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: He’s been under a lot of pressure recently… he
snapped… he had a nervous breakdown… it’s the saddest thing I’ve ever
seen. Let’s be honest about it, nobody gives away forty-two hundred
dollars’ worth of aluminum siding free.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I thought it was very generous, but sometimes
the Lord moves in mysterious ways.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Let me tell you something, when I go and see
his boss and show him this contract, he’s out of this business… he’ll
lose his home … his wife and kids will be thrown out onto the street.
He’ll probably spend some time in an institution, so God knows what will
happen to his wife and kids. Anyway, it’s not your problem.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Why do they have to be thrown out onto the
street?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You don’t expect his boss to pick up the
forty-two hundred job, do ya?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Hmm.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Yeah, it’s a bad state of affairs. Let me ask
you something, sir.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You don’t think there’s some way you could work
with me to try and resolve this, do you?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: How so?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Let’s look at it this way, what if I can sell
you this job at a wholesale price… kind of lessens the burden. The big
boss won’t get so angry, and maybe won’t throw the guy’s wife and kids
out… at least they’ll have a roof over their heads.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: What kind of wholesale price are we talking
about?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You got a cup of coffee?</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: I’ll get you a coffee… won’t be a minute.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Let’s just sit down and kick this around.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: No hurry, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What you doing throwing your money around?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I found a five-dollar bill, here by the side of
the chair.</p>
<p><strong>carly</strong>: The buzzard had a great gimmick. You know,
when it came time to measure a job, he’d cut the yardstick and reglue it
together … he took out seven inches so his square footage would always
be higher. That way he’d always make a few extra bucks on the job.</p>
<p><strong>53 continued: 53</strong>: Stanley laughs and looks at
Carly.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: You’re kidding?</p>
<p><strong>carly</strong>: Yeah… he’d always put his hand over the break
when he was measuring. Nobody looks at a yardstick to see how long it
is.</p>
<p><strong>looney</strong>: I never did that… I never did that… I was
never very good in arts and crafts. I could never make the ruler come
out right.</p>
<p><strong>angle on bb</strong>: He pats his dancing partner on her
rear, she walks back to her table, and BB walks over to where Moe is
sitting. BB picks up his beer can, holds it up to Moe as if he’s going
to make a toast.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Here’s to Nora.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: What else? Give me another story … these
stories are great!</p>
<p><strong>looney</strong>: Just a minute… I’ve got one. You know it’s
like the faster you can start spiking a job, the guy can’t back out of
the deal.</p>
<p><strong>looney</strong>: Shoe had some customers that he thought was
fragile on coming for the buy. He’d say to the guy ‘here let me show you
how bad a shape your house is in,’ and he’d rip off a piece of wood,
maybe fifteen feet wide. The guy’s house looks like shit so it makes it
hard for him to back out of the deal when half the side of his house is
missing. The Shoe’s a fucking wonder.</p>
<p><strong>54 int. sam’s car - night 54</strong>: Sam is driving and
Tilley is rubbing his hands together with excitement.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Fantastic, Sam! A twenty-seven hundred sale!
‘This job is free’! What a beaut! I’m out of the slump! Tilley’s riding
high again … Tilley’s back! We ought to go and celebrate. Let’s go to
the Corral and have a drink… we can turn the paperwork in a little
later.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Gil says that’s where ‘Marengay’ hangs out.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Gil keeps saying it… I’ve never seen him.
I’m riding high… twenty-seven hundred dollars… ‘this job is free’… the
man went insane… lost control of himself… his wife and children are out
on the street! Sometimes I’m brilliant… I’m fucking brilliant… I can’t
believe it.</p>
<p><strong>55 int. corral club - angle on moe and bb - night
55</strong>: They’re looking at the girls, sizing them up.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: See that one, if you were married to that one
two weeks you’d have to put your head out of the window for air… this
one smothers. That one is the kind that can’t live without you… … ‘Where
were you? When will you be home?’</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: I should get out of here. I told my wife I’d be
home early tonight.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Christ! It’s not even one o’clock yet. How long
you been married now? What is it? Twelve… twelve years?</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: Sixteen.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Holy God! Sixteen years? What do you think? Is
it worth it?</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Why do you think?</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: It’s hard to answer. Seems better than if she
wasn’t there.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Quite a recommendation… can’t wait to do it.</p>
<p><strong>angle on door</strong>: Tilley and Sam come through the door
and walk over to the bar.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Scotch straight up?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Scotch straight up and a rum and Coke for
me.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Looks like there’s good action here
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What do you expect, it’s half price night for
divorced women. The place is hopping.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Look how much more complicated things are now.
There used to be a time you met a girl, you courted and then you got
married and lived happily ever after. Now, see that one over there… …
that’s Helen Armstrong… maiden name used to be Tudor. Get this, she
dated Charlie Rider when I was in high school, seemed like they were
together forever. They broke up, she started to go with Lenny Mardigian,
they got married, she’s Helen Mardigian. That goes on two years… three
years, something like that.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: They divorce, dates Billy Small for a couple of
years, lives with John Isaacs for a year, marries Tommy Selnini… that
marriage goes in the toilet, but fast. Now she’s dating Charlie Rider
who was divorced by Evelyn Chartoff who used to be Evelyn Gage before
that. So much for relationships.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’m beginning to believe in God.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: You were never one of those atheists, were
you?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: No, I’m not saying that, but I’m beginning to
give God more thought.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: So, what did you do? Have some kind of
religious experience?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I tell ya… I took my wife for lunch yesterday…
we went and had some smorgasbord, and it kind of happened.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: You found God at the smorgasbord?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Sam, people have religious experiences like
on a lake or when they go up into the mountains, that kind of thing.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Maybe… but I had mine in a smorgasbord.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Sam, you’re too much.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I went to get myself a salad and I started to
see all these vegetables, you know how they have all those salads laid
out so that when it’s time to get to the main course you won’t eat too
much… that scam to get you filled up so you don’t eat too much chicken
and beef and all that other stuff.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Yeah, yeah… I get the point. So?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: So I see celery, I see the lettuce, tomatoes,
cauliflower… and I think, all these things come out of the ground… they
just grow out of the ground. They had corn – out of the ground… radish –
out of the ground. You say to yourself, how can all these things come
out of the ground? You know what I’m talking about? All these things are
out of the ground.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I mean, how can that be? It just happened that
way? And I’m not even getting into the fruits… I’m just dealing with
vegetables right now. With all those things coming out of the earth,
there must be a God.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: I’m not getting the same religious effect
that came over you. I don’t know why, but I don’t feel like running to a
church to pray right this second.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You gotta admit, it’s amazing.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Yeah, yeah… I don’t believe it. See the guy
over there?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: That’s the son of a bitch who crsahed into
my car.</p>
<p><strong>angle on bb and moe</strong>: BB’s looking through the crowd
and sees Tilley.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: I don’t believe it! Mr. Banana Head is here.</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: That crazy guy that banged into my car and
smashed my windows in. I don’t fucking believe it! I’m gonna get
him.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: I’m gonna get him!</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: You got a lot of nerve banging into my car, and
you’ve got a lot of fucking nerve smashing my windows in.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: What’re you talking about? Why would I want
to break your windows?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: You didn’t smash my windows in?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: I’m a hard-working guy… I don’t go around
breaking windows. I’ve got better things to do.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: You didn’t break my windows?! You didn’t break
my windows?!</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Push me one more time and I’m gonna have to
redefine your face.</p>
<p><strong>angle on looney and carly</strong>: They move through the
crowd to BB and Moe. The band keeps playing. Moe and Sam, with the help
of Looney and Carly, pull Tilley and BB apart.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Come on, let’s go outside… let’s settle this in
the parking lot.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Oh, no! You’re not gonna get near my car…
you’re not gonna kick in my headlights again… … What am I talking about?
I didn’t even drive tonight. You wanna duke it? Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>56 ext. parking lot - night 56</strong>: Tilley and BB come
out of the club and start to look for a place in the lot where there’s
some room to fight. The crowd eagerly follows right on the heels of BB
and Tilley. BB and Tilley both take off their sports jackets.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: What is this? What is this crowd here? We’re
charging admission?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Back away… give me some elbow room.</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: Police!</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: against the car;</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: We’ll see who’s the lucky one.</p>
<p><strong>57 int. social security office - tight shot of large cake
57</strong>: with lit candles on it. The cake reads “FAREWELL ADA.”</p>
<p><strong>angle on cake</strong>: as it passes row upon row of
SECRETARIES typing in the Social Security office.</p>
<p><strong>57 continued: 57</strong>: All of a sudden everything goes
black, the typewriters stop and all we can see are the lit candles. We
hear a huge chorus from all of the Secretaries in the Social Security
office:</p>
<p><strong>secretaries</strong>: Surprise!!!</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: I never expected this. What a lovely cake.</p>
<p><strong>girl #1</strong>: Blow out the candles then.</p>
<p><strong>girl #2</strong>: Nine candles for nine months!</p>
<p><strong>girl #3</strong>: We’ll miss you, Ada… you’d better bring
that baby in to visit us.</p>
<p><strong>girl #1</strong>: Register him for his social security
number.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I love ya, Ada, and if you’re smart you won’t
come back.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I’ve just decided… I’m going out with him.</p>
<p><strong>nellie</strong>: You’re kidding?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I have to. I just want to know what it’s like
to be with someone else.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Because if what I’ve got with Tilley is as
good as it gets, I just… … I gotta know.</p>
<p><strong>nellie</strong>: Well, how are you going to manage it?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Tilley doesn’t get home until at least two in
the morning.</p>
<p><strong>nellie</strong>: I hope you know what you’re doing … you
speak to some guy at the frozen food section for five minutes, you could
jeopardize your whole marriage.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Everything I’ve done in my life has been safe
and practical, and where’s that gotten me? Well, here’s to who knows
what.</p>
<p><strong>58 int. bb’s apartment - living room 58</strong>: This is a
two-story apartment in a renovated building. It has high ceilings and
exposed brick. It is sparsely- furnished, but what there is is
decent-looking. We see Nora and BB dancing closely in the shadows of the
dark- ened room.</p>
<p><strong>58 continued: 58</strong>: A Frank Sinatra record is playing
on the RECORD PLAYER in the b.g. – it is “IN THE WEE SMALL HOURS OF THE
MORNING.” A bottle of wine is on the coffee table. The remains of
Chinese food in containers are alongside.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I’m still nervous.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Well, I guess that’s to be expected. You want me
to take you home?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: No, not right now.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Every time I listen to Sinatra, I always
remember when I used to work in Atlantic City back in the late 40’s… you
know, a busboy job… Sinatra used to play at the 500 Club, and we used to
take our dates and say, ‘Hey, you wanna go and hear Sinatra?’ Then we’d
just lean on the door of the club in the alley and listen to the music.
I think the girls were looking for something a bit more uptown.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I’d go with you and lean against the door.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: You’ve got a pretty good aim.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: I sure do.</p>
<p><strong>59 int. bb’s apartment - bedroom - night 59</strong>: Nora is
sleeping in the bed, BB slips a robe on, looks at her and then goes down
the stairs to the living room. He takes a piece of paper out of his
jacket pocket on the back of a chair, and dials a number on the
telephone.</p>
<p><strong>60 int. pimlico hotel - bar - night 60</strong>: TELEPHONE
RINGS at the bar, the BARMAN picks it up.</p>
<p><strong>barman</strong>: Yeah, he’s here… just a minute.</p>
<p><strong>barman</strong>: Hey, Tilley, somebody wants ya on the
phone.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Yeah, this is Tilley…</p>
<p><strong>61 int. bb’s apartment - bedroom 61</strong>: BB on
phone.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Hey, asshole… here’s the ultimate ‘fuck you’… I
just poked your wife!</p>
<p><strong>62 int. pimlico hotel - bar 62</strong>: Tilley on phone.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>63 int. bb’s apartment - bedroom 63</strong>: BB on
phone.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: She’s in my bed right now with a big smile on
her face.</p>
<p><strong>64 int. pimlico hotel - bar 64</strong>: Tilley on phone.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Well, that’s just fine by me… she’s a pain
in the ass… an albatross around my neck. You’re welcome to her… keep
her… and may you both rot in hell!</p>
<p><strong>65 int. living room 65</strong>: BB puts the phone down –
looks puzzled.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Is this a setup? That son of a bitch… I bet he
set me up… I thought I got him, and he got me. That son of a bitch!</p>
<p><strong>66 ext. street - night 66</strong>: Tilley pulls up in his
car in front of his house. He runs up the front steps.</p>
<p><strong>67 int. tilley’s house 67</strong>: He opens the door, flips
on the lights and looks around. He races upstairs and starts rifling
through the closet and drawers, pulling out Nora’s clothes – her
dresses, skirts, blouses, and coats – and he opens the window wide and
throws them out. He screams as he tosses underwear and the rest of her
clothes.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: I’m a free man! I’m a free man!</p>
<p><strong>68 ext. tilley’s house 68</strong>: He exits the house, gets
into his car and drives away.</p>
<p><strong>69 int. tilley’s car - night 69</strong>: Tilley is driving.
The same Sinatra record “IN THE WEE SMALL HOURS OF THE MORNING” is
playing on the car RADIO. Tilley does his now familiar neck exercises to
relieve tension. He’s hard to read… a mixture of happiness and
sadness.</p>
<p><strong>70 ext. diner - night 70</strong>: THROUGH the window of the
diner we see Tilley sitting alone at a table drinking a cup of coffee.
The Sinatra record “IN THE WEE SMALL HOURS OF THE MORNING” plays over
this.</p>
<p><strong>71 ext. street - night 71</strong>: Nora is getting out of
her car in front of her house. She starts to walk toward the house and
stops as she sees her clothing, shoes, etc. scattered all over the lawn.
She tries to take in the scene – coats are lying on hedges, underwear on
the flower beds… she’s shocked.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Oh, my God!</p>
<p><strong>long wide shot</strong>: of Nora’s BACK TO the CAMERA, with
all her possessions strewn over the front garden of her house.</p>
<p><strong>72 ext. bb’s front door - night 72</strong>: Nora is standing
at the door with her suitcase in hand. BB is at the door.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: He must have gone crazy… I don’t know what
happened to him… he must have found out I was with you… I don’t know… I
don’t know what to do.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Can I stay with you for a day or two?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>73 int. pool hall - long shot - day 73</strong>: of a nearly
empty pool hall. One guy plays alone in the far corner of the room.
Tilley comes down the stairs of the pool hall and starts to walk toward
the back rooms – CAMERA FOLLOWS him. He opens the door and goes
through.</p>
<p><strong>74 int. gibraltar aluminum siding company 74</strong>: CAMERA
CONTINUES TO FOLLOW him INTO the offices of Gibraltar Aluminum Siding
Company.</p>
<p><strong>74 continued: 74</strong>: We PASS BY THREE GIRLS on
telephones – they are solicit- ing jobs for the salesmen. CAMERA GOES
FROM one Girl TO the other.</p>
<p><strong>girl #1</strong>: Hello, this is Gibraltar Aluminum Siding
Company, we’re taking a survey…</p>
<p><strong>girl #2</strong>: … Would you be interested in our field
representative giving you a home demonstration?</p>
<p><strong>girl #3</strong>: … Home demonstration. We will have some
factory representatives in your area today as it happens.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Tilley! Let me see you.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Wing, give me a minute to get a cup of
coffee here.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What about ‘Super Highway’ in the seventh… it’s
paying 7 to 1. Ran well in its last race.</p>
<p><strong>gil</strong>: ‘Super Highway’…</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Four in the fourth… twenty bucks.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Who’s that?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: I don’t know… it just came to me – number
four in the fourth.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Number four in the fourth – ‘Rider’s Revenge’ –
60 to 1, never been in the money. Nice pick, Tilley. Why don’t you just
throw the twenty dollars in the trash can right now.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: ‘Rider’s Revenge’… I like that name. I’ve
gotta go and see Wing. Look, we can be scientific from now to doomsday,
but we gotta be gutsy and go for the big one.</p>
<p><strong>75 int. wing’s office 75</strong>: His office is equally
messy and thrown together as everything else in the Gibraltar offices.
As Tilley closes the door, his coffee, which is filled to the top of his
cup, spills over the top and starts to burn his hand.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Ah! Ah!</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: What’s up, Wing?</p>
<p><strong>wing</strong>: You lost a sale, Tilley. The Hudsons’ loan
didn’t go through.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: What do ya mean? They wouldn’t clear the
loan?</p>
<p><strong>wing</strong>: This Mr. Hudson’s some guy. He’s got three
outstanding shoplifting charges, failure to pay child support from a
previous marriage … guy’s overdue on his mortgage, overdue on his car
loan, and he was fired from his last job for misappropriation of
funds.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: What’s wrong with this world? There are sick
people out there! Thievin’ son of a bitch like that takes up my time…
cuts into the amount of hours I have available to deal with other people
interested in my wares! There’s no fucking sympathy for the working man
in this country.</p>
<p><strong>wing</strong>: They don’t make our job easy, Tilley.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Wing, it was such a beautiful thing… you
shoulda seen how I worked. Like a magician… ‘this job is free’! It was
my best… my best! There’s no fucking justice in this world… there ain’t
no justice.</p>
<p><strong>wing</strong>: Did you see the paper?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: What section?</p>
<p><strong>wing</strong>: Take a look at this.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: ’Home Improvement Commission… Hearings begin
today…” Is this McCarthyism? What are they gonna see? If there are any
communists?</p>
<p><strong>wing</strong>: Just cool down the scams, okay, Tilley?</p>
<p><strong>76 int. converted tobacco warehouse - day 76</strong>: An
area has been set up for hearings to take place. This seems to be a
temporary headquarters until something sub- stantial can be worked out.
There are boxes and crates all over. There’s a long table with a number
of commis- sioners behind it, and a defense table a little way across
the room. MICROPHONES are being used, and the sound BOOMS – ECHOING off
the walls. A small gallery of people are watching the proceedings.</p>
<p><strong>angle on john masters</strong>: who is presiding over the
hearings. Even though he wears a tie and a vest, he is nonetheless very
sloppily dressed. To his left and right are two other home improvement
commissioners.</p>
<p><strong>masters</strong>: Now, when you made your initial sales
pitch, did you indicate that you would be giving free storm windows with
the job?</p>
<p><strong>murray</strong>: Free storm windows?</p>
<p><strong>masters</strong>: Yes. That you would provide a free set of
storm windows with the sale of aluminum siding.</p>
<p><strong>murray</strong>: No, sir. I wouldn’t be able to make any
money if I was giving away storm windows. My cost of a storm window is
somewhere like…</p>
<p><strong>masters</strong>: The point being that you had no intention
of giving away the storm windows.</p>
<p><strong>angle on bb and moe</strong>: Standing by the door at the
back of the warehouse.</p>
<p><strong>murray</strong>: The storm windows, as I can recall, was not
an issue. I mentioned that I thought the storm windows would cut down on
their heating bill, and that they would obviously enhance the look of
the house with the aluminum siding work we were going to do.</p>
<p><strong>masters</strong>: So, you weren’t dangling a free set of
storm windows as a come-on to selling them the aluminum siding job?
Because it says here, and I’m reading from a statement from
Mr. Tabaleri…</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: What do ya make of all this?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: It’s the future, Moe… it’s the future.</p>
<p><strong>masters</strong>: ‘It was my understanding that the storm
windows were included in the price of the sale.’</p>
<p><strong>77 ext. tobacco warehouse - day 77</strong>: Moe and BB are
walking away from the warehouse toward BB’s car… AWAY FROM CAMERA.</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: Where do you think they’re getting this
information from?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: I dunno… looks like any tin man gets in that hot
seat, then he’s had it.</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: Then they can take your license forever… it
don’t seem fair.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Boy, I tell ya, I bet you could sell a ton of
these things.</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: That? Too silly-looking.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Ever see a dealership?</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Interesting.</p>
<p><strong>78 ext. racetrack - angle on starting gate - day 78</strong>:
as it bolts open and the horses charge out.</p>
<p><strong>- day</strong>: Sitting at a table. Sam is studying the
racing form, Tilley is studying the menu.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: I keep racking my brain. I gotta find a way
to really get even with this guy. It isn’t enough to wreck his car… even
breaking into his house and messing it up or something, that don’t have
enough impact. I mean, the man poked my wife! I gotta come up with
something ingenious… something ingenious.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: So, what do ya think?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: I think I’ll take some meatloaf.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Meatloaf.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: No, I think I’ll have some fish. No, no…
fish doesn’t fill you up. Meatloaf.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: So, it’s meatloaf?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What do you think, ‘Sally’s pride’ in the
second? Get me a Bloody Mary.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Anything other than the Bloody Mary?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: What number is Sally’s Pride?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Six. No, I don’t like to eat until the third
race.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Six… six… six… six. I’m thinking one. Whose
one?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Mr. Motor.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Then that’s it, I’m going with one.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Tilley, this is insane. You’re picking horses
because you think you’re clairvoyant or something.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Sam, I’m not doing too well by checking the
stats, so why not. I put my hand to my forehead, I see a one – Mr. Motor
in the second… twenty bucks.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Hallihan’s Daughter.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: I got it… I got it…</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Three to one… hundred and sixty smackers.
Hand to the forehead! Hand to the forehead!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You’re not exactly talking about a long shot.
Mr. Motor, for instance, is coming off at 50 to 1.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Third race, I see a six… I see a three. I
don’t think the verdict’s in on that one yet.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Wing paid a hundred on number five, he
loses, I got hundred and forty… next race I’ll lay down the bet. What
you taking in this race?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Thrifty’s Delight – number four – 20 bucks.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: You take Thrifty’s Delight – 20 bucks, I got
20 on Mr. Motor, Wing’s got a hundred on Night Fire. What’s the odds on
Night Fire?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Twenty to one.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: I don’t see Night Fire winning. Fuck it, I’m
not gonna even place the bet… I just made a hundred bucks.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What are you, crazy? What happens if he
wins?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: He’s not gonna win… I feel it.</p>
<p><strong>79 continued: 79</strong>: Tilley heads towards the betting
booths. Wing enters near the booths, Tilley yells to him.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Hey, Wing, we’re sitting just off the left
of the entrance. I’m gonna lay down your bet right now. See you in a
minute. You lost the first race, in case you don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>81 int. bb’s cadillac - day 81</strong>: BB is behind the
wheel, Moe is beside him in the passenger seat.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: I tell you something, she’s getting on my
nerves.</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: Who, Nora?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Yeah, yeah… who else is it gonna be… ‘who,
Nora”!… who else is there? The whole idea of being with a girl on
consecutive nights is new to me. It’s one thing when they’re with you
for a night, but when they live with ya, it’s stretching the point. They
got a lot of things they bring with them… you go to the bathroom you see
’things’ you never saw before.</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: So, what’s the todo?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Well, they move your stuff around and it’s not
where it used to be… I’m not used to that.</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: You mean all this time you’ve never lived with
a girl?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: What?! Did we just meet? How long we been
partners? No, I’ve never lived with a girl!</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: Boy, oh boy! Did you wake up on the wrong side
of the bed today?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Yes, I did. I came in last night, she was
sleeping on my side of the bed. In my life I never got out of bed on the
left side… in my life, never from the left. I got close once up in the
Catskills. I met this girl, Dorian. For a week we were together, but it
wasn’t the same because she always went to her room to change and do all
that stuff. She didn’t have things in my room.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: All this ’cos I’m trying to get even with some
guy. You know what? I think I got to see her and put an end to this.</p>
<p><strong>82 int. social security office - day 82</strong>: We see
hundreds of secretaries typing away, and clerks sitting at desks. BB
walks into the office, peeking his head around the corner, feeling a
little uncomfortable. He starts to walk around trying to find Nora out
of all the secretaries and clerks.</p>
<p><strong>angle on nellie</strong>: Nora’s friend. She looks up from
the typewriter and sees BB. In his thick overcoat, huddled up, he seems
a little lost, and it’s obvious that he’s looking for someone.</p>
<p><strong>nellie</strong>: to Nora at the</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Yes. Bill!</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>83 int. social security office - coffee area 83</strong>:
Nora gives BB a small kiss.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I’m glad you stopped by. This is a real
surprise.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Listen, I got a problem.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Oh. How can I help?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Um… er… Well, the problem is… like… is like… eh,
you know… you’re the problem.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: really taken</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: There’s things that are bothering me.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: You know… things.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Things?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: You know, like things that come up… stuff… like…
you know, annoyances.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Annoyances?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Hard to explain… very hard.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Well, try.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: As an example… I came home last night, I get
undressed, and I realize you’re sleeping on my side of the bed. I’ve
always slept on that side… it’s something I’ve always done.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Then why didn’t you just nudge me a bit and
tell me to go and sleep on the other side?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: I didn’t want to wake you up… I thought you
might think it was kind of stupid or something.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Well, that’s easily changed.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: But there are other things… bigger things. But I
realize just talking about it, they all sound petty and silly.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Listen, if you think all of this is going too
fast, maybe I should move out. Is that what you want, Bill?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I really care for you, but if you think it’s
best. I don’t want to make you unhappy.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: I don’t think we’ve got to take drastic
action.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Thought I’d come by and get things off my chest…
talk it out. Listen, I’m going over to Pimlico… catch the seventh race…
wanna come?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I can’t get away from work.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>84 int. turf club at racetrack - closeup of tilley - day
84</strong>: watching a race.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: We’re taking a thirty-to-one shot… number
eight… come on number eight… ‘Streamers…’ come on, you sucker!</p>
<p><strong>85 ext. racetrack - day 85</strong>: We see horse number
eight in the lead, coming around the home stretch.</p>
<p><strong>86 ext. grandstands - day 86</strong>: Moe and BB are
watching the race.</p>
<p><strong>87 int. turf club - angle on tilley, sam and wing - day
87</strong>: Tilley is still yelling for his horse, Sam and Wing watch
quietly.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Thirty-to-one… a hundred bucks on you,
number eight. There’s a guy up here who put a hundred on ya. Come on…
come on… come on, baby… come on, baby!</p>
<p><strong>88 ext. racetrack - finish line - day 88</strong>: Another
horse – number 14 – races past the winning post.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Nooooooo!</p>
<p><strong>89 continued: 89</strong>: Wing smiles.</p>
<p><strong>wing</strong>: I’ve got myself a winner.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Way to go… Southern Belle.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Should have bet with me, Moe.</p>
<p><strong>wing</strong>: Very nice!</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: That was your horse, Wing?</p>
<p><strong>wing</strong>: Yeah… Southern Belle. You oughta know, you bet
her for me.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>wing</strong>: I’m gonna go with the favorite in this one –
Fordnee Lane.</p>
<p><strong>wing</strong>: I tell you what, I won sixteen plus on the
other race, from those winnings you can bet me eight hundred.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Eight hundred?</p>
<p><strong>wing</strong>: Yeah… I wanna bet eight hundred on Fordnee
Lane.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Fordnee lane – eight hundred.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Eight hundred.</p>
<p><strong>wing</strong>: Waiter, can you get me a cup of coffee?</p>
<p><strong>wing</strong>: You guys want anything else?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Er… hum… er… hey, Wing… I tell you, I got a
problem.</p>
<p><strong>wing</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: It’s the eight hundred on Fordnee Lane. I
haven’t got it.</p>
<p><strong>wing</strong>: No, you got it wrong. You take it from the
sixteen plus I won… the eight hundred.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: I haven’t got the winnings.</p>
<p><strong>wing</strong>: What do ya mean, you don’t have my
winnings?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Wing, it was the craziest thing… I didn’t
want to mention it earlier because it was so nuts… it was the craziest
thing.</p>
<p><strong>wing</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: I don’t know how to even tell you this
without being embarrassed for myself. It was an accident… it’s like one
of those things out of the blue… it’s crazy… you can’t explain it… it
happens.</p>
<p><strong>wing</strong>: Sam, what is he talking about?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: He had an accident of some sort.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: It happens… I don’t know how… I don’t know
how to explain. It’s too crazy, I swear to God, Wing.</p>
<p><strong>wing</strong>: Wait a minute… you’re telling me that I didn’t
win the last race?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: You won, Wing… you won, it’s just that
you’re not getting any money… it was a fluke. I swear, I don’t know how
it could have happened. A ten-year-old couldn’t have made the mistake I
made… I don’t know, I swear.</p>
<p><strong>wing</strong>: What the fuck is he talking about?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: If there was some way I could make it up,
believe me, I would, because you know where I stand.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: You know where I stand, Wing. If there was
any way, believe me, I’d make it up. I’d give you thirty percent of what
you didn’t get because it was a fluke… I’m willing to make some kind of
retribution.</p>
<p><strong>wing</strong>: You just pocketed the God damned money… you
just took my money and slipped it into your God damned pocket, didn’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: No. I’d split fifty-fifty with you, that’s
how badly I feel under the circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>wing</strong>: You get this straight, you son of a bitch, you
owe me sixteen plus… I want sixteen plus.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Am I trying to shirk my responsibility?
That’s not the way I see it… it was a fluke, a crazy thing that
happened, but I stand behind my honor on this… put it on my tab.</p>
<p><strong>wing</strong>: What the hell is wrong with him? What the hell
is wrong with him? He’s stealing money from me… what the hell is wrong
with him? Can you tell me?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I don’t know the whole story.</p>
<p><strong>wing</strong>: You work with him, Sam… for Christ sake…</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: What do you mean, wrong? It was a fluke… it
was an accident. I don’t know what the hell went wrong. It was a
one-in-a-million thing that happened to me when I went to place that
bet. I’m trying to do what I can.</p>
<p><strong>wing</strong>: Tilley, what the hell happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>92 ext. racetrack - late afternoon 92</strong>: Tilley and
Sam are leaving the racetrack and walking to Tilley’s Cadillac.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Why didn’t you at least give him the six
hundred that you pocketed from the six races he lost?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Fuck him! It’s on my tab. At least I’ve got
six hundred in my pocket right now. It’s like another loan. Sam, you got
to think about today. Today, I got six hundred bucks in my pocket. You
know what I’m saying?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: It’s like some guy trying to sell me life
insurance. You think I’m gonna take some money out of my pocket to give
to some jerk so that somebody can take it when I’m dead? No, Sam, you
gotta live for today. I’m gonna live as good as I can every day. You
know what I’m saying?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Hey, Mr. Marengay went to the track!</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Did you bother to bet, or did you just hand your
money to the tellers?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: The sarcasm’s killing me. I thought you were
looking to get even.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Who’s your accountant, mister, ’cos I think
you’re down in the debit side.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Who’s stuck with my wife. You or me?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: You want me to believe that you were setting me
up with your wife as some kind of decoy?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Decoy is the word!</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Okay then, you win.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: I win? That guy would never let me win. He
must be setting me up. The son of a bitch is setting me up, Sam.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: For crying out loud, why don’t you just leave
it at that… you win.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: I couldn’t have won. I smell a rat.</p>
<p><strong>93 int. bb’s cadillac - day 93</strong>: BB’s driving and Moe
is in the passenger seat.</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: BB, I think you’re getting a little humility in
your blood.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: If getting Nora is part of losing, Thank God I
didn’t win.</p>
<p><strong>94 ext. old tobacco warehouse - day 94</strong>: A temporary
sign is posted on the door and a painter is filling in the name – “HOME
IMPROVEMENT COMMISSION.”</p>

the office of the Home Improvement Commission. Desks, chairs and filing
cabinets are all over the place and boxes and cartons are stacked
against a wall. ANGLE ON John Masters walking with a file under his arm.
He walks across the half-empty warehouse where workers are renovating
the space. He approaches a table where Stanley is seated with his feet
up, nursing a hot cup of coffee. Masters throws a file down on the
table.</p>
<p><strong>masters</strong>: This is good, Stan… nice work.</p>
<p><strong>masters</strong>: Fossey says it should go down very well
with the city council. Could help us appropriate more funds. This goes a
long way to establish our credibility in what we’re trying to do.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: There’s a lot more where this came
from.</p>
<p><strong>masters</strong>: You know what I think you should do now.
Why don’t you pull some files… some files that were completed, others
that went unsold, and I’ll have somebody run it down, talk to the
customers and get some statements.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Pulling files is another thing. That might
not be easy.</p>
<p><strong>masters</strong>: To sneak a few here and there when you
can.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>masters</strong>: I think that might be good.</p>
<p><strong>96 ext. street - night 96</strong>: BB’s Cadillac is parked
in front of a house.</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: What do you think if we made this one of our
factory showcase houses?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: It’s a good location… get a lot of traffic on
this street.</p>
<p><strong>97 int. house - night 97</strong>: BB and Moe are selling to
MR. and MRS. SHUBNER, a young couple. The TELEVISION is ON in the
background.</p>
<p><strong>shubner</strong>: What does that mean, Mr. Gable?</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: You know what I do, Alan? I pick certain houses
that are strategically located, we put up the aluminum siding, and for
every referral, for every person who sees this quality job that we do…
sees how beautiful it is… I give you two hundred dollars.</p>
<p><strong>shubner</strong>: Two hundred dollars?</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: That’s right. God knows how many homes we could
sell by people passing this house. It’s perfectly placed for that. Alan,
this is how confident I feel that this house will drum up business for
me.</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: Four hundred dollars… I’m giving you commission
on two house referrals before I put a panel on the side of your house…
that’s how confident I feel.</p>
<p><strong>shubner</strong>: You think that many people are going
to…</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: I’m certain of it. I’m not giving away four
hundred dollars for my health… I’m a businessman, and I’m a good
businessman. This is good business for me. I’m giving it away ’cos I
believe in this house, believe that it will refer me to other jobs which
means money in my pocket, which means money in your pocket.</p>
<p><strong>shubner</strong>: You got a deal, Mr. Gable.</p>
<p><strong>shubner</strong>: Something wrong, sir?</p>
<p><strong>98 int. hospital corridor 98</strong>: Moe is being wheeled
on a gurney by a couple of nursing attendants. BB walks alongside.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: I finally got hold of May… she was over your
sister’s.</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: Oh, I forgot.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: She’ll be down here shortly.</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: BB, I don’t have any insurance. If I die, May’s
got nothing… nothing… nothing for Leonard. The only money I’ve got is in
my pocket. That’s all I got.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Just take it easy, Moe… rest.</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: Did they sign? Did they sign?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Don’t worry about it now.</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: Goddamn it, BB! Did you sign them?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Don’t worry… don’t worry. I’ll take care of it
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: Goddamn, my chest hurts. I always taught you,
BB, never walk out of a place without a signed contract. Somebody’s word
ain’t spit.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: They’ll sign, Moe. Don’t worry, they’ll
sign.</p>
<p><strong>99 int. hospital hallway 99</strong>: BB is on a public phone
to Nora. We never see Nora, we just hear her voice.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: This is kind of new to me, but I thought I
better call and tell you I’m gonna be late… maybe two or three. I never
had anyone there to call before, but I thought I should call, you
know.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Why? Do you think you have some
obligation?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: I dunno… I thought I’d better call, that’s
all.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Well, I’m glad you did.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: I don’t know what’s gonna happen to Moe.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Well, I hope he’s okay. I’ll see you when you
get in.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Let me see what the damage is. Babum… babum…
babum… babum…</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Mouse, figure it out, will ya?</p>
<p><strong>gil</strong>: Why don’t we just split it five ways?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: No way! I didn’t eat anything, so why should
I pay for Mouse… he eats like an animal.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Well, sometimes you’ll eat more than he does,
and it’ll even out.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: No way! He’s a pig! He always eats more than
anyone else. Why should I pay for his food?</p>
<p><strong>mouse</strong>: What’re you talking about? Today I happened
to have eggs and flapjacks, some cantalope, some juice and then another
juice.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Like an animal! Like an animal!</p>
<p><strong>mouse</strong>: But yesterday, what did I have?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: What did he have? Sam, what did he have?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Let me get out my notebook. How the fuck do I
know what he had?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Well I don’t remember what he had. Gil, what
did he have?</p>
<p><strong>gil</strong>: Pancakes?</p>
<p><strong>mouse</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Then what did you have?</p>
<p><strong>mouse</strong>: Guess.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: What is this, a quiz show? We don’t know
what you had. What did you have?</p>
<p><strong>mouse</strong>: I had very little.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Very little!! You eat like an animal! It
couldn’t have been very little.</p>
<p><strong>mouse</strong>: I didn’t have that much… doesn’t anybody
remember?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: We don’t remember, I don’t know why.</p>
<p><strong>gli</strong>: I could have sworn he had pancakes.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: He said he didn’t have pancakes.</p>
<p><strong>mouse</strong>: I’ll give you a clue… maple syrup was
used.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: I don’t give a shit.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: French toast.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: French toast? He had more than French
toast.</p>
<p><strong>mouse</strong>: Yes, but not a lot more.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: I don’t give a damn… it’s split five
ways.</p>
<p><strong>gil</strong>: Your wife’s knocking on the window here.</p>
<p><strong>101 int. diner - day 101</strong>: Nora and Tilley are
sitting alone at a table drinking coffee.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Was not long ago you never would have seen a
woman in here.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: You don’t have to tell me. How many nights did
you drop me off and come up here all the time?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: I know. I was just trying to be congenial…
you know, start a conversation off, on a nice kind of light level, you
know. So, what’s the scoop, Nora?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Well you know, I think we really should get
divorced.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Makes sense. You want some more coffee?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Yeah, I’ll have some.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Florence, some coffee here. It’s for the
best. You know, we were kind of fooling ourselves, weren’t we?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Yes, it went wrong somewhere along the line –
I don’t know where though.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Yes, something went wrong… I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: So you like this guy?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Yeah, I like him.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: All in all I guess it’ll all work out for
the best.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I’m glad you feel that way.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Yeah, can you figure it out? A guy bangs
into my car, thinks I did him in, tries to get even with me by stealing
my wife, you two people fall in love… can you figure that out?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: You telling me you didn’t know this was the
guy?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: This was that guy?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Yeah, I told you I ran into another tin
man.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: He didn’t tell me he was a tin man… he told me
he sold baby pictures.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: It’s your life. All I know is this guy has a
bent weather vane.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Oh, God! Not another tin man.</p>
<p><strong>102 int. superior aluminum siding company office - day
102</strong>: We see and hear the Girls working the telephones, as

<p><strong>girl #1</strong>: Good afternoon, this is Superior Aluminum
Siding. We’re going to have…</p>
<p><strong>girl #2</strong>: … a salesman in your area today…</p>
<p><strong>looney</strong>: Beeb, why don’t you let Stanley work with
you. I’m off to Florida at the end of the week for some sun and fun. Let
Stanley work with you, and when I get back, we’ll see how Moe’s
doing.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: I don’t know. To be honest with you, I think I’d
rather work alone … he’s too green. Is he a pain in the ass?</p>
<p><strong>looney</strong>: No. He don’t talk much; he’s a good
listener, so he can’t really get on your nerves. He’s a lousy pool
player and he can’t play cards for shit, but…</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: So what good is he?</p>
<p><strong>looney</strong>: Studious type… takes a lot of notes.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: If this is a sales pitch, I think you got to
work a little harder ’cos I don’t think you’ve got good product.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: What are you, crazy?!</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: You’re a goddamn tin man!</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Wait a minute! Wait a minute!</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: You wanted to win me just to get even with my
husband… screw you!</p>
<p><strong>angle on looney</strong>: as he walks out of the building. He
sees BB’s car all smashed up.</p>
<p><strong>looney</strong>: I think you ought to get rid of this car…
it’s bad luck.</p>
<p><strong>looney</strong>: Is that the guy again?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: No, it’s his wife.</p>
<p><strong>looney</strong>: There’s some kind of sickness that runs in
that family.</p>
<p><strong>104 int. pool hall - tight shot of mouse - day 104</strong>:
He’s singing “The Banana Boat Song.”</p>
<p><strong>mouse</strong>: ‘Day-O! da,da,da,da,day… daylight come and he
wanna go home…’</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Why can’t they get rid of that fucking
record? It’s not a hit anymore… nobody cares about this song anymore…
it’s history.</p>
<p><strong>mouse</strong>: ‘Day-O! da,da,da,da,day…’</p>
<p><strong>gil</strong>: We can always smash the juke box, or break in
and steal the record.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: He’s getting on my nerves. The guy eats like
an animal, and sings like an asshole.</p>
<p><strong>gil</strong>: Maybe it’s me, but I’m beginning to like
it.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Yes, sir… yes, sir!</p>
<p><strong>angle on sam</strong>: He comes out of the back room into the
pool hall, and walks over to the table where Tilley and Gil are playing
pool. He drops an open envelope onto the pool table.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Take a look at this crap.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: IRS? They’re not gonna leave me alone!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Home Improvement Commission.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: We’ve got to appear?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I think that’s the gist of what they’re
saying.</p>
<p><strong>mouse</strong>: Holy Christ!</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Can’t we just ignore it? How do they know we
got the letter.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: It’s certified.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: What do you think, Sam?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I dunno… I don’t know what they’ve got.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Why is this happening? Am I paranoid or
something? I mean, why is this happening? The government is after me…
the state is after me… Mr. Marengay … somebody is always after me. What
the hell’s going on here? I’m just this guy. What’s the big deal? They
can’t get along without me? The government can’t operate unless they’ve
got Tilley’s money… the Commission’s after my job! This shit’s driving
me insane! All the lying, thieving, stealing corporations in this world,
and the IRS takes the time to come for me? There’s billions of dollars
out there but they’ve got to come and get Tilley’s four thousand
dollars! Turn off the fucking Belafonte song now, or I’m gonna break the
goddamn machine!!</p>
<p><strong>105 int. corral club - night 105</strong>: BB is sitting at
the bar, getting drunk. Stanley sits next to him. A girl approaches
.</p>
<p><strong>ruthie</strong>: Come on, Beeb, let’s dance.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Not tonight, Ruthie, my dancing shoes are on
holiday.</p>
<p><strong>ruthie</strong>: You sure?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: I’m more than sure.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Who was the best you ever saw?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Best I ever saw? Best tin man I ever saw?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Harry Apel… Dandy Flynn… those guys had good
lines, but they burned themselves out too fast. Best? Moe’s the best…
the best there ever was. If he’s in the door, he’s got a sale. The best
closer ever.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: What’s some of the hustles he used to
pull?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: God damn Nora… God damn Nora! I’m trying to
adjust… I’m putting up with things I never put up with in my life. I
mean, give me a break… give me a break, woman.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: So, what are a couple of things you and Moe
have done?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: It was getting to be real pleasant … figure
that. More than pleasant. To hell with her!</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: How come Moe’s so good? Why do you think,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Great man, Moe. Great man.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: I don’t know why they’re so irrational… chicks.
I dunno. I think it’s because air gets inside ’em. She probably went
back home, to her husband. Eleven-thirty… he wouldn’t be home yet. This
outght to cover it, Stanley.</p>
<p><strong>106 ext. street - night 106</strong>: Sam’s Cadillac moving
along a row of houses.</p>
<p><strong>107 int. cadillac - night 107</strong>: Sam is driving the
car, Tilley is in the passenger seat, very drunk.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: They got no right. You know what I’m saying,
Sam? They’ve got no right.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: They’ve got nothing concrete against us,
because if it’s just hearsay stuff, it’s neither here nor there.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Where’s my car? What happened to my car?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: It’s better I drop you off.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Yeah, it’s better.</p>
<p><strong>108 int. tilley’s bathroom - night 108</strong>: Tilley is in
the bathroom washing his face in the sink, trying to sober up. He lifts
his head out of the water and bangs it on the faucet. He grabs his head
in pain and then slides down the tiled wall to the floor.</p>
<p><strong>109 ext. street - night 109</strong>: BB’s Cadillac pulls up
in front of Tilley’s house. We see BB looking up and down the street,
with his head out of the car window. He’s very drunk.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: He ain’t here.</p>
<p><strong>110 int. tilley’s house - bathroom - night 110</strong>:
Tilley is lying on the floor. His eyes open at the sound of the TRASH
CANS FALLING. He struggles to his feet and walks through the bedroom. We
hear the sound of MORE</p>
<p><strong>110 continued: 110</strong>: Tilley goes to the bedroom
window and looks out. He sees BB struggling to his feet, surrounded by
trash cans and garbage.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: I knew I could smell a rat! The son of a
bitch is coming for me… the son of a bitch never wants to leave me
alone!</p>
<p><strong>111 ext. street - night 111</strong>: BB making his way up
the front stairs to Tilley’s house.</p>
<p><strong>112 int. tilley’s house - night 112</strong>: Tilley makes
his way down the stairs, and creeps to the front door.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: You want to rob my God damn house? I’m gonna
make it easy for you. Come and rob Tilley… come on… take everything he’s
got.</p>
<p><strong>113 ext. front door of tilley’s house - night 113</strong>:
BB knocks on the door. The door swings open. He waits a moment, unsure
as to what to do.</p>
<p><strong>11436 int. tilley’s house - other side of front door
114</strong>: Tilley stands behind the door with the gun, waiting. BB
steps inside the house.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Hel…</p>
<p><strong>115 int. tilly’s house 115</strong>: BLACK SCREEN. Then a
light goes on, and we see the in- side of a refrigerator. PULL BACK to
reveal Tilley at the refrigerator in the kitchen of his home. He is
putting eggs and rotten tomatoes from the refrigerator into a bowl. He
looks at a piece of celery, but it’s so wilted and has no strength for
his purpose that he throws it down. He picks up other vegetables, but
settles for the eggs and tomatoes. He closes the re- frigerator door and
makes his way to the living room. We see BB lying on the floor,
unconscious. Tilley sits down across from him with the bowl in his lap…
he watches BB. BB starts to come to.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: You’re a sick man! You smash my car, you
steal my wife, and now you come to rob me! You’re one demented human
being.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: I’m going to call the police and send you to
jail… but I’m going to humiliate you first.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: What’re you doing?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: What do ya want to break into my house for?
This ain’t the fucking Rockefeller mansion! There ain’t thirty-eight
television sets here.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: They ain’t saying ‘Nelson, I think we’ve had
a break-in… count the sets to see how many we’ve got left.’ There ain’t
tons of jewelry hanging out of drawers… it ain’t like I don’t know which
watch to put on, I got so many. I’m a working man, trying to make an
honest living. What fucking morality you got, asshole?!!</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: You’re the craziest human being on the face of
this earth!</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: What else do you want from me? Huh? What
else?! I’ve got enough problems with the I.R.S. busting my balls and the
Home Improvement Commission bullshit to contend with. I don’t need
aggravation from you.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Nobody does this to me and lives! Nobody!</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: How do ya like your eggs? Over easy? Side of
tomatoes?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: You’re going to rue the day you ran into my car.
This ain’t the end… this is just the beginning.</p>
<p><strong>116 int. police station - night 116</strong>: A POLICE
OFFICER is interrogating Tilley behind the main desk of the police
station. There’s a lot of activity during this interaction… people
coming and going.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: A guy breaks into my house and I’m being
charged with assault? It makes no sense…</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: Let’s get it down right. The guy
broke into your house, you hit him in the head with a gun, went to the
refrigerator, took out eggs and tomatoes and threw them at him.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: I was defending myself… he was stealing from
me.</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: It doesn’t sound like defense to
me.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: I wanted to humiliate the guy. Here I am,
out busting my ass all day making a decent living, I come home, and some
schmuck is trying to steal from me.</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: So you hit him with a gun, and
pelted him with eggs and tomatoes?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: If I had some soup I would have thrown soup
at him… is there any law you can’t throw eggs?</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: Mr. Babowski claims he didn’t break
into your house.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: What did I do? Invite him in so that I could
throw eggs at him?</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: Maybe Mr. Babowski intended to break
into your house, but these circumstances of the guy being pelted with
eggs and tomatoes is something we need to look into.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: He’s lucky that he didn’t rob me last week,
’cos then my wife was living at home and we had all kinds of things in
the fridge… I could have thrown barley soup, pumpkin pie, candied yams…
yeah, he got off light.</p>
<p><strong>117 ext. police station - day 117</strong>: Tilley and Sam
exit the building. Seconds later BB and Bagel come out of the police
station. Both pair of men head for their respective Cadillacs. BB has
egg stains all over his suit.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: I can’t believe it, the man throws eggs at me
and now I’m gonna have breakfast with him.</p>
<p><strong>bagel</strong>: His partner says maybe the two of you can sit
down and come to some kind of settlement.</p>
<p><strong>118 int. tilley’s car - day 118</strong>: Tilley is sitting
in the driver’s seat and Sam is next to him.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: What am I supposed to say to him? The man
has been a pain in the ass since the day he rammed into my car.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Just air your differences and we’ll put an end
to this.</p>
<p><strong>two cadillacs</strong>: as they start to pull out of the
parking lot.</p>
<p><strong>120 int. coffee shop - day 120</strong>: Tilley, Sam, BB and
Bagel are sitting at a table together looking at menus.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: I tell you what… I’ll drop the charges against
you, and we can wipe the slate clean.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: I appreciate it.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: See how quickly you can clear it up?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: But I don’t understand how the slate gets
wiped clean when he breaks into my house and I’m the one charged.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: I told you, I wasn’t breaking into your house. I
was looking for your wife.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: All right… all right… I’m too tired… the
slate’s clean… the slate’s clean.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: What will you have?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Couple of eggs over, some hash browns, some
toast – toasted dark… butter on the side, large grapefruit juice and
some coffee.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: On second thought, instead of the eggs over,
if I ordered soft boiled eggs do you take them out of the shell or leave
them in the shells?</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: We leave them in the shell.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: I don’t like them that way because they get
hot in the hand and it’s hard to scoop the stuff out… it’s not good… and
you get little bits of shell in there and it doesn’t taste good.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Why don’t you just order some scrambled eggs and
be done with it… all right?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: If I’m going to order, at least I ought to
be content with my food.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: I’m getting a little hungry… I’ve got a headache
as it is. Just order some eggs so some other people can have something
to eat before the lunch trade comes in.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Why do I need a guy telling me what I should
or shouldn’t eat?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: This is not a four-star restaurant … we’re not
having a gourmet meal… we’re ordering breakfast, for Christ sake!</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: It so happens I haven’t been to this
restaurant before. I don’t know how they do their eggs… if they’re over
easy and they’re gooey, I’m not happy with it… and I’m not happy if the
soft boiled eggs are left in the shell…</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Can I have some French toast and a cup of
coffee? Bagel, what do you want?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Hey! I’m ordering here. At least you can
have the courtesy to let a man order his breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: French toast and a cup of coffee.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Sam, this guy gets on my nerves… from day
one! I knew it then and I know it now.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: I’m back to pressing charges against you!</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: You want to play that way? This game ain’t
over, mister… it ain’t over…</p>
<p><strong>120 continued: 120</strong>: BB stands up. The Waitress steps
back and looks concerned.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: All right, you want to finish it now? You want
to finish it right now? I’m ready… I’m ready now!</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: You’re ready?! You’re ready, that’s what
you’re saying?! You’re ready now?! I have to be intimidated… I have to
be brought here to be intimidated…</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: I can’t stand it any longer. You’re driving me
out of my mind.</p>
<p><strong>bagel</strong>: Come on, guys… take it easy… take it
easy.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Get the people with the straitjackets… this
man is out of control.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: We’re gonna finish it… we’re gonna finish
it.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Come on, let’s get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: I’m not finished with him, Sam. You heard
me… I’m not finished with you, mister.</p>
<p><strong>120 continued: 120</strong>: He storms out of the coffee shop
with Sam. Bagel sits back, looking relieved. BB composes himself. The
Waitress nervously stands by.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: So, I’m having French toast and coffee.
Bagel?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Moe, when you decided to marry May, how did you
know?</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: Know what?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: How did ya know?</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: You mean to make up my mind to marry her?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Yeah. How did ya know?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: This Nora is a pain in the ass, Moe… a pain in
the ass. It’s worse now than when she used to be around.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: You wanna hear something? The other night at the
Corral Club, I turned down a dance.</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: You turned down a dance?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: What’s the odds on that? You think you can come
up with odds on that one?</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: Hundred to one BB don’t dance… a hundred to one
against.</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: I’m getting out of the business, BB… I’ve got
nothing for all this.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Lot of good times, Moe.</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: A lot of good times, but I can’t live off the
good times. You know, my brother-in-law has offered me a job at Hess
Shoes. I think maybe I should do it. You get there in the morning, you
come home at night… you get health benefits… I get to be assistant
manager.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: That’s it, Moe? You’re gonna spend the day
measuring people’s feet? ‘You’re an “E” fit… you’re a “D” wide… you got
a high arch… I’ll show you something in an alligator… something with a
wing tip…’ How can you talk about that all day long? Moe, you’re the
best tin man there ever was. Nobody’s a better closer.</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: It’s over, BB… it’s over.</p>
<p><strong>121 continued: 121</strong>: BB looks at Moe for a long beat.
He’s obviously greatly affected by this.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: So, May’s happy about this Hess Shoe thing,
heh?</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong>: To say the least.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You know, when I saw ‘Bonanza’ the other day,
something occurred to me. There’s those three guys living on the
Ponderosa and you never hear them say anything about wanting to get
laid. You never hear Hoss turn to Little Joe and say ‘I had such a
hard-on when I woke up this morning.’ You know … they never talk about
broads … nothing. Ya never hear Little Joe say ‘Hey, Hoss, I went into
Virginia City and saw a girl with the greatest ass I ever saw in my
life.’ Ya just see ‘em walking around the Ponderosa saying, ’Yes, Pa,’
and ‘Where’s Little Joe?’ Nothing about broads. I don’t think I’m being
too picky… at least once if they talked about getting horny. I don’t
care if you’re living on the Ponderosa or right here in Baltimore, guys
talk about getting laid. I’m beginning to think that show doesn’t have
too much realism. What do you think, Tilley?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Sam, I can’t concentrate on ‘Bonanza’
shit…</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: I’ve got too much on my brain, what with
that asshole and the Home Improvement Commission, I don’t want to have
to worry about whether Little Joe got laid last night. Let’s go and eat
something.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Yeah, we’ll go and have some lunch at the
smorgasbord.</p>
<p><strong>123 int. thor’s smorgasbord restaurant - day 123</strong>:
Tilley and Sam are in line at the buffet. Sam fills up his tray and
moves off to the cashier. Tilley hangs behind staring at all the food.
He looks up to the ceiling.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: God, if you’re responsible for all the stuff
down here, maybe you got a moment’s attention for me. Between the
I.R.S., this Home Improvement Commission and Mr. Marengay, I got it up
to here with this bullshit. To be frank with you, I’m in the toilet
here. If you can see your way…</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Listen, I’m praying here… go around.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: I wanted to get some of the salad.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: It’s out of order… go around.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Do what you can, all right? I appreciate it.
Amen.</p>
<p><strong>124 int. superior aluminum siding office - day 124</strong>:
The usual office activity. BB is at a desk. He picks up the phone and
dials.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Nora Tilley, please.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: What department is she with?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: She’s with Social Security.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Which department is Social Security?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: I dunno… she’s there somewhere … yeah, on the
third floor… she’s got a desk towards the back.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Just a moment… checking.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: In the b.g. Stanley has gone over to
a filing cabinet and is starting to look through the files. Cheese
wanders over to him.</p>
<p><strong>cheese</strong>: Stanley, can I help you look for
something?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: No, I’m just making myself busy.</p>
<p><strong>cheese</strong>: Well, I wouldn’t do that. Bagel don’t like
nobody looking at the files.</p>
<p><strong>back to bb</strong>: on phone. He’s still holding for Nora.
We hear a RING on the other end of the phone.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Mrs. Tilley.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Nora, this is BB.</p>
<p><strong>125 int. tobacco warehouse - day 125</strong>: The Home
Improvement Commission is in session. Tilley and Sam sit at the defense
table. Masters presides over the commission table where four or five
other commis- sioners sit.</p>
<p><strong>masters</strong>: Didn’t you approach Mr. Boloshevski August
18, 1961, while he was cutting his front lawn and tell him that his
house had been selected, as one of only 16 homes in the state of
Maryland, for a free aluminum siding job?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: What’s the name again?</p>
<p><strong>masters</strong>: Boloshevski.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Doesn’t ring a bell. Sam, does it ring a
bell to you?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: It doesn’t ring a bell to me either, sir.</p>
<p><strong>masters</strong>: Didn’t you suggest that for a nominal labor
charge, he would receive over five thousand dollars’ worth of aluminum
siding?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: That’s an awful lot for nothing. Doesn’t
sound like good business to me.</p>
<p><strong>masters</strong>: Mr. Boloshevski was ultimately charged
twenty-four hundred dollars for labor, which according to our figures is
about the average cost of an aluminum siding job.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I don’t get the point of this.</p>
<p><strong>masters</strong>: Twenty-four hundred dollars that you
charged for labor, is the same as if Mr. Boloshevski had purchased the
aluminum siding and had the labor done.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Maybe I’m missing the point here, but if he
paid twenty-four hundred, which is the cost of the job, I can’t see
anything wrong with that. I don’t know the guy, but I don’t quite get
the problem.</p>
<p><strong>masters</strong>: What we’re getting at here… what we’re
trying to stress, is that the job was sold under false terms. The man
didn’t win any award… he was not getting aluminum siding at a special
price. A clear case of deception was involved here.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: What’s he talking about? The man got the job
for twenty-four hundred dollars, and that’s what it costs in aluminum
siding.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Um… I don’t know… we have no recollection of
this particular job, but I don’t know if this is deception. Look, if you
work in a clothing store, some guy tries on a suit, it looks like shit,
but you tell him it looks wonderful. The guy’s standing there looking
like a sack of shit, the salesman says what a great suit and the man
buys it. That’s deception as far as I can see, but I don’t understand
the deceptiveness that you say we’re responsible for… if I make myself
clear.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’d go along with that as well.</p>
<p><strong>masters</strong>: What we’re trying to establish are the
principles that have been laid down as part of the Home Improvement code
of ethics… that you cannot mislead someone intentionally, and I think
that’s the principle that applies to this.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Did somebody put a gun to this guy’s head
and make him spend twenty-four hundred dollars? I don’t get the point
here. I don’t know the specifics of this case, not being privy to all
the information, but all I can say is this guy got a fair price for a
fair job.</p>
<p><strong>delaney</strong>: Do you know Mr. and Mrs. Rayburn of 156
Aberdeen Avenue, Essex?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: and shrugs his shoulders; then</p>
<p><strong>delaney</strong>: The couple purchased twenty-eight hundred
dollars’ worth of aluminum siding and the two of you were the salesmen
on record. They say, and I quote here, ‘that they would have received
one hundred and fifty dollars per home for every person in the
neighborhood who saw their house and decided to buy aluminum siding.’ Is
that true?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: It sounds right.</p>
<p><strong>delaney</strong>: Are you aware that, according to the Home
Improvement code, you are not allowed to exceed a twenty dollar limit in
incentives?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: We wanted to be a little more generous,
that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>delaney</strong>: The couple said that they never did receive
any money from any other jobs, as you had promised.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: We didn’t get any leads from them. Their house
was not the showplace that we thought it would be. It didn’t generate
the activity that we had hoped.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: But should a referral turn up in the
community, we’d be more than happy to give them twenty dollars instead
of the hundred and fifty.</p>
<p><strong>masters</strong>: Excuse us for one moment.</p>
<p><strong>masters</strong>: Thank you very much, gentlemen. Should
there be a reason in the future to call you back, we would like to
reserve that right.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Glad we could be of some service.</p>
<p><strong>126 ext. tobacco warehouse - day 126</strong>: Tilley and Sam
are walking toward Tilley’s car.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: We beat ’em, Sam… we beat ’em! What a piece
of cake! No problem! They ain’t got nothing on us… clean as a whistle…
we’re clean as a whistle!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I need a drink. I hate inquisitions.</p>
<p><strong>127 ext. social security office - night 127</strong>: Heavy
RAIN is falling. Nora, with an umbrella, walks quickly across the
parking lot. Suddenly BB slips under the umbrella with her.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I don’t want to see you anymore.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: I gotta talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I don’t want to listen.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Give me a chance to explain. You owe me that
much.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I don’t owe you anything.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: It was a lousy thing to do, okay? It was a lousy
thing to use you to get back at your husband… but the fact is that I
never would have met you otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: It was lousy… it was a disgusting, terrible
thing… but a lot of good came out of it.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: What kind of a person would come up with such
a devious thing?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: I’m not always a nice guy, I admit that. I got a
lot of training in deceit… it’s an occupational hazard.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I’d like to know what it is about me that I
have to fall for tin men. What kind of character flaw do I have?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: I didn’t want to have to come here. I wish that
I didn’t have to ever see you again. I’ve gone this far in my life
without having to have this kind of thing happen to me. I was going
through life, sailing along, pretty good… doing okay, and I tried to get
even with some crazy guy… and I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: The wet becomes you. Gets rid of some of the
slickness.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: I don’t like the idea that I’m not in control of
this, but if this stuff’s got to happen, I guess I’ve got no choice. I
wanna… ya know… … I wanna be with ya! Okay, I said that… I said it,
okay?! I wanna be with ya! It pisses the hell out of me, and I’m gonna
tell you that to your face, but I want to be with you because… I miss
you and I’d like to live with you… I’d like to marry you… and that’s
that!</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I was hoping for something a little more
romantic… but, okay.</p>
<p><strong>128 int. pimlico hotel - bar/restaurant - night 128</strong>:
Tilley and Sam are sitting at the bar nursing a couple of drinks. In the
b.g., the pianist is playing “Last Night When We Were Young,” and a few
people are sitting around the piano joining in with the song.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Ya know, Tilley, we been working together for
over a year.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Yeah, must be about that.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’ve been thinking that sometimes a different
combination makes for better luck. Ya know what I mean? I mean, maybe
the two of us ain’t the right combination.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: I’m just getting used to ya, Sam.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Let’s face it, we’re not exactly setting the
world on fire.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: It’s a slump… it’s a slump, Sam.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Maybe it’s a slump, but like baseball, some
time they have to change the lineup to get the team going again.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: You’re not serious about this, are you,
Sam?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: You’re serious? You wanna get another
partner? You don’t think I’m gonna pull out of this?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I know you’re gonna… I know you’re gonna.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Look, we beat the Commission today … you know,
we got a little bit of a victory. We split right now and maybe we can
add to that… you know what I’m saying?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: I know… I know. Change in the lineup. Okay,
maybe it’ll help… maybe it’ll help. You got any ideas for a new
partner?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Well, I had a conversation with Solly Shavitz,
so… maybe I’ll go with him. Mouse is gonna need a new partner because
Dennis is going into used cars.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Mouse! Mouse! He gets on my nerves… He eats
too much. Here’s to some pretty good times, huh?</p>
<p><strong>129 int. corral club - night 129</strong>: Looney, looking
tanned, sits with Stanley at the bar. BB and Nora are dancing in the
b.g.</p>
<p><strong>looney</strong>: I don’t get it… the broad smashes into his
car and he takes her dancing. Some kind of dating ritual that I’m not
familiar with.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: BB’s a pretty good tin man, huh?</p>
<p><strong>looney</strong>: Pretty good? Whew! Man’s what legends are
made of. Started selling pots and pans door to door at sixteen. Nothing
he can’t sell.</p>
<p><strong>angle on bb and nora</strong>: The song ends and BB walks
Nora back to the table they were sitting at.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: You’re gonna come back and stay the night?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I dunno… all my things are back at Nellie’s –
the other side of town. I know what I could do, I’ll go back to the
house… there’s still a few things I left behind … at least I can get a
change of clothes.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: I’m glad this is working out.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: You really happy?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: You don’t really show a great deal of
exuberance.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Honey, for me… I’m a parade.</p>
<p><strong>night</strong>: Rattling a special padlock. PULL BACK to
reveal Tilley at his front door, trying to get in.</p>
<p><strong>130 continued: 130</strong>: CAMERA PANS to see Nora’s car
pulling up in front of the house. Nora turns off the car lights and
exits the car. She starts up the front walk and stops.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: The I.R.S… they need my furniture. They got
some living room somewhere in this country that needs to be
furnished.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: They’re taking the furniture?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: The furniture, the whole house. They locked
it up… they confiscated it.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: What do you expect? You expect to get some
preferential treatment … you’re some special case? You’ve got to pay
your taxes just like everybody else has to pay their taxes!</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: How many arguments did we used to have about
filing your taxes?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: We had a lot of arguments.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: There’s a responsibility that you’ve got to
have. It’s a long way from high school, Tilley.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: I was doing pretty good there for a while…
doing pretty good. Had my house, had a wife, a Cadillac… I still got my
Cadillac.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Where are you gonna sleep?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: I’ll stay at Sam’s for a couple of days
until I get set up. What’re you doing here, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: There’s just a couple of things you didn’t
throw out of the house … a couple of things I didn’t find in the
drawer.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: I don’t know… I did a pretty good house
cleaning number on you.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Listen, about the divorce. Do you want to
file, or should I file?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: I got to be frank with you, this guy is
nuts.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: He told me all about it… all about how you
threw eggs at him.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: He told you it was about eggs? The guy tried
to break into my house. He tried to steal things from me.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: He was trying to find me. We had an
argument.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: I think you’d be making a big mistake if you
married him.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: It’s not for you to make decisions for me.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: I think maybe I should, because I think
you’re being misled… I think you’re confused. I think…</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I know what I’m doing.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Nora, listen to me. I know about guys…</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I appreciate your concern, but it’s not for
you…</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: But this guy is as bad a choice as you could
make. Bad choice.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: You’re a good one to give advice… you’re
sitting on the steps, locked out of your house because you can’t pay
your taxes, and you’re going to give me advice on life?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: I’m not giving you a divorce, and that’s it.
I’m looking out for your welfare. No divorce.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: It’s for your own benefit, and you’ll thank
me for it.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: My benefit! You don’t give a damn about me!
You don’t give a damn who I marry. The reason you don’t want me to marry
is because he’s the one taking your wife, and you’ve got your own
problems with him.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: You don’t care about me… it’s the same
bullshit you’re doing. That’s what it always is with you, Tilley. It’s
always you! The I.R.S. took your house… your furniture! You don’t say
anything about my things in the house. I’ve got things in the house I
worked damn hard for, and things that belonged to my family… the
headboard that was given to me by Aunt Josephine, it’s got to be at
least a hundred years old… and the hand-embroidered footstool…</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: What footstool?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: The hand-embroidered footstool over by the
TV.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: I don’t remember seeing that.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: It’s been there forever… it was my
granny’s.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: It’s been there forever? I’ve never seen
it.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: You’ve never seen it!? You’ve never seen it!?
You put your feet on it to watch TV… the hand-embroidered footstool.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: I don’t know what you’re talking about. I
never put my feet up to watch TV.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: That’s the way you are, Tilley, it doesn’t
mean anything to you. You don’t care if they take it all away. It’s all
you, Tilley! That’s the way it’s always been.</p>
<p><strong>130 continued: 130</strong>: She stands there for a moment,
then turns back to her car, gets in, slams the door and drives off.
Tilley stands on the front steps with a puzzled look on his face.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Hand-embroidered footstool?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Thanks for the lift back, BB. See ya
around.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Okay, Stanley.</p>
<p><strong>132 int. superior aluminum office - night 132</strong>:
Stanley is standing at the filing cabinet going through files. He takes
some files and puts them to one side. Then, satisfied that he’s got
everything he needs, he picks up the files and turns to leave. BB is
standing at the door watching him.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: You know something, Stanley, I can always smell
a guy who’s not made of tin.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: It’s against the law to steal files. I could
call and have you arrested and sent to jail, right now.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I’ll put everything back, nobody’s the
wiser.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: You work for the Commission, is that it?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Doesn’t the Commission have enough information?
They got to send out guys like you to spy?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Well, we just started out, and if we had
some really good hard facts of some infractions, it would give us a lot
of credibility in the community.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: You know what your big problem is, Stanley?
You’re lazy. If you want to find out stuff, then you dig… you get on the
phone… you canvas… ‘We’re from the Home Improvement Commission…’ Go find
your leads… that’s what we do all the time. You’re just lazy, Stanley.
If we’re doing something wrong, you should collect all your evidence.
Instead, you snoop around… steal files. What is this? Undercover time?
You think you’re breaking up some big drug ring? Is this the Mafia
you’ve infiltrated? All you’ve got here is a bunch of guys selling tin
for Christ sake! You want some files?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Here… here’s some jobs I did. Leave Moe out of
this… he quit the business.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Go on, get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Why are you doing this?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: If it’s not gonna be you, it’s gonna be somebody
else… and if it’s not tonight, it’s gonna be another time.</p>
<p><strong>133 int. bb’s house - bedroom - night 133</strong>: BB and
Nora are in bed together.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Maybe if I talked to him another day he’ll
change his mind. I mean, he’s like that… one day, he’s this way and
another day he’s that way.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: You don’t need to talk to him.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I mean, he’s probably, you know, upset about
the I.R.S. taking the house and all our stuff.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Ever see a Volkswagen?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: You know, those little Volkswagens.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: It’s a car… a little car.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: What does that have to do with anything?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: I dunno… they’re interesting.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: It’s interesting.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: What’s so interesting about a car?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: I dunno. It’s a little thing… you know, a little
thing. Guy tells me they don’t even have radiators… they’re
air-cooled.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: It’s interesting… different… something new. I
like it.</p>
<p><strong>134 int. gibraltar aluminum siding office in pool hall
134</strong>: Wing is standing up at the blackboard chalking out
schedules and sales. Tilley stands back and looks at the board, seeing
his name up with Mouse.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Tilley and Mouse. It looks weird, doesn’t
it? Looks very weird.</p>
<p><strong>wing</strong>: Let’s hope you have some better luck with
Mouse.</p>
<p><strong>135 int. pool hall 135</strong>: The pool hall is fairly
unlit, except for the slight shaft of light falling over several tables.
Gil is play- ing pool with another tin man. Mouse, Sam, and three or
four other tin men are playing pool.</p>
<p><strong>angle on stairs to pool hall</strong>: BB comes down the
stairs into the pool hall.</p>
<p><strong>angle on gil</strong>: He stops playing pool.</p>
<p><strong>gil</strong>: Mr. Marengay.</p>
<p><strong>gil</strong>: Hey, Tilley… Mr. Marengay’s out here.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Can I talk to you in private, or do I have to
talk to you over fourteen pool tables?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: We’ve got enough that’s going down between the
two of us, but the fact of the matter is that I love your wife, and I
want to marry her.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: I don’t care who she marries, but I don’t
want her marrying you!</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Why don’t we just talk about this in a nice,
rational manner.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Rational? You’re going to be rational?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: We’ve got our problems, but let’s try and
isolate this particular situation.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Isolate… isolate… I like this kind of talk.
What the hell nonsense is that?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: What are you gonna gain from this thing
here?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Now let me see here… I’ve got to isolate
that for a moment and think it over.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Nobody’s going to benefit from making me
mad.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: You ought to hear yourself. You know that?
You ought to listen to the way you talk. You come in here, you want to
take my wife … you want to isolate this situation… you want to be
rational. I’ve got no tolerance for you, mister. You know what I’m
saying?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: What you’re saying is you don’t want to discuss
this, am I right?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: You like pool?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: I enjoy the game.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Why don’t we play a little game of eight
ball? If I lose, I consent to the divorce… if you lose, you give Nora
up… walk away from her.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Rack ’em.</p>
<p><strong>tight shot of cue ball</strong>: hitting the balls on the
break. A seven ball drops into the pocket. CAMERA PANS TO BB who has a
smile on his face at the successful break he just made. He quickly moves
around the table, lines up a shot and sinks the ball. Tilley looks a
little concerned. BB moves around the table quickly, confidently. He
lines up another shot. He carefully strokes the pool cue between his
fingers, hits the ball, and sinks the shot. He moves around the table –
he has a particularly complicated shot.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Combination… side pocket.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: That’s four.</p>
<p><strong>135 continued: 135</strong>: He quickly surveys the table and
sees his next shot. He hits the ball, it goes toward the pocket, but
bounces back slightly, missing the pocket. Tilley quickly goes to work.
He sinks his first shot… his second. He makes a difficult shot.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Yes, sir! Yes, sir!</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: You make this one here, and you win.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Don’t I know it… don’t I know it!</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Bad break.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Tough break.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: You lose.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Yeah… that puts an end to one of our
differences. Now, concerning you…</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: I’m gonna beat the crap out of you. You want it
here or do you want it outside?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Outside.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Stay out of this… this is between the two of
us.</p>
<p><strong>angle on door to office</strong>: Wing is standing watching
the fight. He looks disgusted … shakes his head.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: I think our business is finished.</p>
<p><strong>136 ext. industrial estate area - day 136</strong>: BB drives
up to the front of the Superior Aluminum Siding building. He stops the
car and gets out. He is fairly disheveled and has a bruise on his cheek.
He walks up to the entrance of the building.</p>
<p><strong>137 int. superior aluminum siding office - day 137</strong>:
Three or four GIRLS are on the phones canvassing for sales.</p>
<p><strong>girl #1</strong>: … Improves the insulation…</p>
<p><strong>girl #2</strong>: … We’ll have a representative in your
area…</p>
<p><strong>looney</strong>: … Danny’s an example of that. Danny goes
into a bar, chicks lined up and down the bar. Walks up to one and says,
‘Honey, would you like to fuck?’ She’d slap him in the face. He’d move
down to the next girl, say the same thing… she’d slap him. Then he’d
just keep moving down, going from one girl to the other. Fifteen, maybe
sixteen girls would tell him to get lost… to get the hell out of
there…</p>
<p><strong>looney</strong>: … Call him names… but he doesn’t take it
personal, you see … he keeps going, and then the next girl smiles. He
says, ‘Why don’t you buy me a drink’… he scores. Every time. He goes
through a lot of girls, takes a lot of slaps in the face, but he never
takes it personally…</p>
<p><strong>looney</strong>: … And he always gets what he wants.</p>
<p><strong>looney</strong>: Hey, Beeb. What happened to you? That broad

<p><strong>138 ext. pimlico bar/restaurant - night 138</strong>: Tilley
drives into the parking lot of the Pimlico – he heads for a dark corner
of the lot where about eight cars are parked. As he’s about to park his
car, he sees Wing talking to Masters in the car next to his. Tilley’s a
bit confused, stays in his car watching them. After a couple of beats,
Wing gets out of the car and heads for the Pimlico. Masters drives off.
Tilley gets out of his car and catches up to Wing.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Hey, Wing, isn’t that the putz from the
Commission?</p>
<p><strong>wing</strong>: Masters? Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: What the hell’s he doing hanging around
here?</p>
<p><strong>wing</strong>: He wants information.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: I nailed his ass the other day, Wing. Can’t
lay a finger on me. I was amazing, you should have been there. I was
amazing… I was respectful, courteous, but I was slipping and sliding…
they couldn’t touch me.</p>
<p><strong>wing</strong>: I got a real problem, Tilley. Come inside,
I’ll buy you a drink.</p>
<p><strong>139 int. pimlico bar - night 139</strong>: Tilley and Wing
are sitting at a table. The pianist is playing, and people are sitting
around the piano joining in with the song.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: You’re gonna sell me out to the Commission?
Wing, am I hearing this right?</p>
<p><strong>wing</strong>: I’m up front with you about this… I’m up front
with ya, Tilley. I’ve got my balls in a vice… what am I gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Is this about the money I owe you? Are you
just pissed? You want to get even because of the horse race? I told ya
it was an accident.</p>
<p><strong>wing</strong>: Tilley, it’s got nothing to do with the
money.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: You’re selling me out? You’re gonna let them
bury me? Jesus Christ, Wing… Jesus Christ! I’m not gonna be able to work
in this business? Wing, this was my chosen field!</p>
<p><strong>wing</strong>: Masters was gonna take this company apart.
You’re the low man on the totem pole, Tilley. There’s a lot of guys
earning a good living… no sense for it all to go up in smoke. You
understand, don’t you, Tilley? It’s just business.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Jesus Christ!</p>
<p><strong>wing</strong>: Listen, Tilley, you owe me sixteen plus from
the race, and you’re in for over two grand on the books, so I tell you
what… I’ll wipe the slate clean.</p>
<p><strong>wing</strong>: Here’s a thou until you get yourself set up. I
can do no better than that.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: You’d sell me out for a lousy three thousand
dollars? Three thousand dollars and I got to go down the toilet? Jesus
Christ, Wing, how long the two of us been busting our asses together …
Jesus Christ! We got some history to this relationship for Christ sake.
Masters puts a little squeeze on you, you just sell out. Three thousand
dollars?!</p>
<p><strong>wing</strong>: The bottom line is, I’m running a business,
Tilley. Here’s another deuce. I carried you a long time, Tilley. I’ve
done a damn sight more than a lot of other guys would have done for you…
and I don’t see no gratitude from you.</p>
<p><strong>wing</strong>: You can finish up whenever you like. I’m
sorry, Tilley. That’s the way of the world.</p>
<p><strong>141 int. tilley’s cadillac - night 141</strong>: The RADIO is
playing. Tilley stops the car, turns off the lights, but leaves the
radio playing. He leans in- to the back of the car and takes a pillow
off the back seat. He props the cushion up against the passenger side,
and lies down, looking up to the roof of the car.</p>
<p><strong>143 int. bb’s apartment - kitchen - eggs - day 143</strong>:
being fried in a frying pan on a stove.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Bill! Better hurry up, everything’s ready.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: Eggs being slipped onto a plate with
some bacon and hash browns.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: BB comes into the kitchen of his
apartment. He is tying his tie. WIDEN SHOT to include Nora.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I can’t believe that you’re up so early. This
is a rare occasion.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Yeah. I just got some business downtown I gotta
take care of.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Toast will be ready in a second. Coffee’s on
the table.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Listen, Nora. I… um… I… er … lied to you the
other day.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: How so?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: I went to see Tilley about the divorce.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: He was not too agreeable, and one thing led to
another, and we decided to shoot some pool to settle the matter.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>143 continued: 143</strong>: The toast pops up – she ignores
it.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: We played pool. If I won he’d give you up, if I
lost I’d give you up.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: You played pool for me?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Nora, I had no choice.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: It’s the most despicable thing I’ve ever heard
in my life. I mean, it’s disgusting… guys shooting pool to determine my
future.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Nora, I had no choice! Hand me the toast.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Get the toast yourself.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: I’m just trying to be honest. It’s been on my
mind… on my conscience.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: This plate yours or mine?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Why don’t you take both… maybe you can choke
to death on one of them.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: How can you be so… how can you not understand
how wrong that is? I can’t understand that mentality! Shoot pool for me!
It’s insane.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Tilley is not the most rational man in this
world. I tried to talk to him… he wouldn’t listen. So, what are my
options? You know what I’m saying? What are my options?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I can’t believe you had to shoot pool! Don’t
you understand that … don’t you understand how crazy that is? You’re
sitting there… you’re eating your eggs as if it’s normal business in
life here! Like feudal lords or something you used to read about in
history books.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: All right, I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: I lost.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: You lost?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: I blew the eight ball.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: You lost?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: It means I’m supposed to give you up, and I’m
never supposed to see you again.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Will you stop eating the eggs for a minute!
How can you tell me things like this and casually eat your eggs?! What
does this mean, Bill?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Well, I’m supposed to give you up as part of
honoring that agreement, but I’m not that honorable a guy.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: I gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Why are you running off so fast here?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: I told you, I got some business downtown.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: I’ll see you later.</p>
<p><strong>144 ext. bb’s apartment - front door - day 144</strong>: Nora
walks behind him, stands and watches him go out the door and down the
front steps. He gets into his car and drives off. Nora stands at the
door watching the car drive away.</p>
<p><strong>145 ext. downtown street - day 145</strong>: Tilley pulls his
Cadillac into a parking space just a little up the street from the
tobacco warehouse which houses the Home Improvement Commission. He gets
out of his car, locks the door and starts down the street. BB’s car
drives past Tilley. CAMERA FOLLOWS BB’s car as he pulls into a parking
space close to the Commission building.</p>
<p><strong>146 int. tobacco warehouse - day 146</strong>: Corridor off
the main hearing room. The hearing is not yet in session. Tilley sits on
a bench against a wall. He glances up, his eyes drop and then he looks
ACROSS CAMERA. CAMERA PANS TO the opposite side of the corri- dor where
BB sits on another bench against a wall. BB glances off at Tilley and
then drops his eyes. CAMERA PANS BACK TO Tilley. A few beats go by. Both
men are uncomfortable with one another’s presence.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: You gotta testify, huh?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: You?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: You got a lawyer?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Nah. I already testified once. I beat ’em
before, I’ll beat ’em again. You got a high-priced mouthpiece to speak
for ya?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: I don’t need one. I don’t expect to win.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: How so?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: I gave them some pretty incriminating
evidence.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: You gave them evidence?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: The only way I could think to get out of this
business.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Hey, that’s good… that’s good, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: The hearing for the Home Improvement
Commission is now in session.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: So… how’s Nora?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: She’s doin’ all right.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Ernest Tilley?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Yeah… here. Take good care of her.</p>
<p><strong>147 int. tobacco warehouse - long shot of hearing room - day
147</strong>: of the Home Improvement Commission. Five or six
commissioners are behind a long table, led by John Masters, there is a
gallery of observers, and Tilley sits at the defense table across from
the commissioners.</p>
<p><strong>masters</strong>: Are you aware that that’s a violation of
sections 258 and 261?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: I’m not aware of the section numbers.
Sometimes you get a little overzealous in the heat of the sales pitch,
that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>masters</strong>: Was it the heat of the sales pitch on
February 23rd of this year that made you write across a contract ‘This
Job Is Free’?</p>
<p><strong>on tilley</strong>: who is falling apart.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: As I remember, no sale was made concerning
those customers.</p>
<p><strong>masters</strong>: It fell out because a loan couldn’t be
arranged, but the people did agree in principle. The point that we’d
like to stress, is that you misled these people. Told them the job was
free. Then you sent in your closer with some cover story about how you
had suffered a nervous breakdown, and a sale was ultimately made for
twenty-three hundred and seventy- seven dollars. That is misleading and
deceptive sales practice.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: It was temporary insanity. I don’t know… it
just came over me … it might have been something I ate. I don’t know… it
was crazy, I’m the first to admit it was a crazy thing to do. Believe
me…</p>
<p><strong>masters</strong>: We have other specific examples of
deceptive sales practices on your behalf concerning a job carried out on
December 11, 1962. You violated sections 241 and 247. And concerning a
job sold to Mr. and Mrs. DeFranco on October 9, 1962, violations of
sections 251 and 257 took place.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: What are all these numbers here? I’m not
familiar with all these section violations.</p>
<p><strong>on bb</strong>: who is watching the proceedings intently.</p>
<p><strong>masters</strong>: It is the feeling of this commission that
these infractions are severe violations of the Home Improvement Laws,
and therefore constitute misuse of the license to sell aluminum siding
as approved by this state.</p>
<p><strong>masters</strong>: It is the decision of this commission to
revoke your license to sell aluminum siding…</p>
<p><strong>camera on tilley</strong>: He’s not very happy.</p>
<p><strong>masters</strong>: … Which will prohibit you from practicing
in the state of Maryland.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Are you sure? Maybe the guys want to think
this over.</p>
<p><strong>masters</strong>: Thank you, Mr. Tilley. You may hand over
your license to the clerk of the commission on your way out.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: gets up from the table and goes to the back
of the room to exit the building. He stops at a desk just inside the
door where the clerk is sitting. Tilley pulls out his wallet, takes out
a small document, and throws it down on the desk. He exits the
building.</p>
<p><strong>148 int. tobacco warehouse - day 148</strong>: Same as
before, except now we see Stanley enter and sit amongst the
observers.</p>
<p><strong>masters</strong>: Will Mr. William Babowski please come
forward.</p>
<p><strong>masters</strong>: You have the right to have a lawyer present
if you so wish.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: I do not wish.</p>
<p><strong>149 ext. tobacco warehouse - day 149</strong>: Tilley walks
down the street toward his car. Suddenly he realizes that there’s an
empty space and his car is gone. Tilley’s a little confused, thinking
that perhaps he parked elsewhere. A YOUNG BLACK KID walks up to
Tilley.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Did you have a car parked here? A Cadillac?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Yeah. What about it?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: A man told me to say they took it.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Who took it?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Man said, the tax man. Gave me a dollar to tell
you so.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Tax man! Fucking I.R.S. How low can you get?
How low can you get?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: They’re lowlife. How can people come and
take a man’s car?… His Cadillac?</p>
<p><strong>masters</strong>: I think with the number of violations on
your record, Mr. Babowski, this commission has no recourse but to revoke
your state license.</p>
<p><strong>masters</strong>: Would you please drop off your license with
the clerk of the commission on your way out.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>151 ext. tobacco warehouse - day 151</strong>: BB walks down
the street, making for his car. He sees Tilley still standing in the
vacant parking space. Tilley sees BB. BB stops.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Sorry about your license.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Yeah. You in there?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Yeah. They got my license as well.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Sorry to hear it.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: What are you doing standing there?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: This is where my car used to be.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Stolen?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: I.R.S. Fucking bandits! Bandits! Thieving
sons of bitches!</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: You need a ride uptown?</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: I could use one.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>152 int. bb’s cadillac - day 152</strong>: BB’s driving and
Tilley’s in the passenger seat.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Some bullshit commission, huh? Tell me,
where’s it written it the Constitution that says you can’t hustle for
money? Where’s it written? It ain’t like I went into an alley and hit a
guy over the head with a brick and stole his money… not like I broke
into somebody’s house and stole his stuff. All I’m doing is selling…
where’s the crime in that?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: I don’t know what the world’s coming to.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: You’re telling me. I don’t know what the
world’s coming to.</p>
<p><strong>153 int. bb’s cadillac - little later 153</strong>: BB’s
still driving and Tilley’s in the passenger seat.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: You know what our big crime is? We’re nickel and
dime guys. We’re small time hustlers. They got us because we’re hustling
nickels and dimes.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Nickels and dimes. You got a good point
there, BB. You’re right on the money with that kind of thinking.</p>
<p><strong>angle on bb</strong>: as he watches the car.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Gotta find a new business to get into.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: New? Very hard to find something new to get
into.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Maybe… maybe not.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Better put on my thinking cap… not easy to
think of something new.</p>
<p><strong>154 ext. street - long telephoto shot of city - day
154</strong>: showing stacks of houses as the Cadillac drives away. A
MacDonald golden arch is being put in place by a crane on the horizon
line. It’s almost as if it’s a rainbow across the far side of town, and
the Cadillac will drive through it.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Believe me, we’ll find something. It’s just a
matter of time.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Yeah… matter of time.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: You know, I hear the new Cadillac’s gonna be out
in a couple of months.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: You’re kidding?</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: Yeah… they’re changing the body. I hear it’s a
beaut.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Maybe I should put in my order now.</p>
<p><strong>bb</strong>: What’re you talking about? You ain’t got a pot
to piss in.</p>
<p><strong>tilley</strong>: Give me the pot… I’ll fill it.</p>
