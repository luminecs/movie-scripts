<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Are you crazy? You’ll wake the whole
neighborhood!</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: Hi Mom.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Don’t “hi Mom” me. What are you still doing
up? It’s past one!</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: I thought I’d wait for you.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Well, I’m home now, so you can go right to
sleep. C’mon, angel.</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: It’s okay, I’m not tired. Really.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Kristen, don’t start with me. You know what
your shrink said…</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: He’s full of shit.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I am not going to let you get me into an
argument, goddamn it. Not tonight. Now get in bed.</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: Mom? I’m still having these awful
dreams.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Elaine? Where do you keep the bourbon?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I’ll be right down! Look honey, I’ve got a
guest.</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: And you don’t want to keep him waiting.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: That’s right. I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>children</strong>: One, two, Freddy’s coming for you, three,
four, better lock your door, five, six, grab your crucifix…</p>
<p><strong>little girl</strong>: Hello. What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: Kristen. What’s yours?</p>
<p><strong>little girl</strong>: I have to go now. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: Wait! Don’t go in there!</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: Little girl!</p>
<p><strong>little girl</strong>: This is where he takes us.</p>
<p><strong>little girl</strong>: Freddy’s home.</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: Mommy…?</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: In local nows, two more teenage deaths
have occurred – both suicides. County health officials are at a loss to
explain this alarming trend –</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Nothing like a little cheery news to start the
day.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Say listen, Doc. I got a new theory about all
these suicides.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Don’t hold back on us, Max. We need all the
help we can get.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Fucked up chromosomes, man. Think about it.
Their parents all dropped acid in the Sixties.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: It beats Dr. Simm’s theory. She thinks it’s
nothing but sex, drugs, and rock &amp; roll.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Shit, that’s what keeps people alive.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Good morning, Jennifer.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Morning, Doctor Goldman.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: How’s your hand?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Menthol, regular, ultra-light.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: They’re healing up nicely.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I’ve been good. When do I get cigarette
priveleges back?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Don’t hold your breath.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Hi Taryn. You don’t look so hot, kid. Been
getting any sleep?</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: How is he?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Cooling down.</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: If he continues having these outbursts, I’ll
have to have him isolated permanently.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Don’t worry, it won’t come to that.</p>
<p><strong>kincaid</strong>: I ain’t gonna dream no more, no more, I
ain’t gonna dream no more. All night long I sing this song, ’cause I
ain’t gonna dream no more…</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: I read the report on our new staff member.</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: What did you think?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Frankly, I don’t understand why some grad
school superstar is being treated like a seasoned pro.</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: She’s been doing ground-breaking research on
pattern nightmares.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Elizabeth, we don’t need any outside help. I
know these kids. I don’t want some hot-shot taking chances with them
just so she can get published.</p>
<p><strong>p.a. voice</strong>: Doctor Goldman to Examination, stat.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Don’t give me that shit! She’s just trying
to get attention, that’s all! I’m not playing her little game any-
more!</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Suicide attempt. They just brought her in
from County General!</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: What’s her name?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Kristen Parker. She was fine until we tried
to sedate her.</p>
<p><strong>orderly</strong>: Watch it! She tore her stiches out!</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Kristen, we want to help you!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Calm down, baby sister, that’s enough nonsense
for now.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Kristen, I’m Doctor Goldman. I’m not going to
hurt you. I’m just going to give you something to help you sleep.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Back off, Max!</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: Five, six, grab your crucifix… seven,
eight, better stay up late… nine, ten, never…never…</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Never sleep again.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Who taught you that rhyme?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Tell me about the kids.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: You’ll get to meet them all tomorrow.
They’re…survivors. In a way. All severely sleep disordered. Insomnia,
narcolepsy, bedwetting…</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: But nightmares are the common thread?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Right. They seem to share a group delusion, a
“boogeyman” for lack of a better word. They’re so traumatized, they’ll
do anything not to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Anything?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: We lost a kid about a month ago to Fairview. I
don’t know where he got the razor…but he cut off his own eyelids to stay
awake.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Oh God.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Ever work with vets? These kids act like
they’ve got D.S.S. – Delayed Stress Syndrome. If I didn’t know better,
I’d swear they’d seen heavy combat.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I wouldn’t be so sure they haven’t.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: What’s that supposed to mean?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I’ve had some experience with pattern
nightmares.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: So I’ve been told. Practically an obsession of
your.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Call it a passion. I’ve got to get going.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Make sure to check in with Max, he’ll give you
the 25 cent tour.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Thanks. See you in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Ms. Thompson.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Call me Nancy.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Only if you call me Neil. What was that
nursery rhyme all about?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Just something children sing…to keep the
boogeyman away.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: The whole wing’s devoted ot this program.
That’s your office.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: A little basic, but nice.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’ll have a file cabinet in there before
tomorrow. The patient’s rooms are down here.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: This is Phillip. We call him The Walker.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Why is that?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: ’Cause I sleepwalk. A perfectly normal
event that our illustrious staff loves to theorize about endlessly.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Phillip, this is Nancy.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Hi. Welcome to the Snake Pit.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Thanks. Nice work.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: They really oughtta be carved out of wood,
but they won’t let me have a knife. I might, you know… Fffft!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: That lump over there is Kincaid.</p>
<p><strong>kincaid</strong>: I do it so I don’t have to look at your
face all the time.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Riiiigghht.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: They’re good kids. But don’t let ’em fool you.
They’re dangerous…to themselves and each other.</p>
<p><strong>marcie</strong>: Why thank you, Joey.</p>
<p><strong>lorenzo</strong>: Hey, Marcie. These going to C Ward?</p>
<p><strong>marcie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>lorenzo</strong>: C’mon, I’ll walk you down.</p>
<p><strong>marcie</strong>: See you later.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Mrs. Parker, was Kristen acting different?
Did you notice anything strange before she made the attempt?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Kristen specializes in strangeness. I’ve
spent thousands on psychiatirists.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Did she always have nightmares?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: They’ve gotten worse since I took away her
credit cards.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I’m serious.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Look, Miss Thompson, I don’t know what you
want from me.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Just some answers. There are other kids
involved, its not just Kristen. All good kids, smark kids.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I’m sorry to hear that, but you’re the
experts on this, not me. If I had any insights, believe me, I’d share
them with you.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I’m sure you would.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Now if you’ll excuse me, I have to get to
the club.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I’ll need to take her things.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: The maid packed a suitcase. Teresa!
Teresa?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I’ll get it. Please, I don’t mind.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: First door up the stairs.</p>
<p><strong>hypnocyl</strong>: FDA classification: Experimental.
Effective for management of psychotic disorders. For sedation where
dreamless sleep is considered optimal; suppression of night terror.</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: NANCY!</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: NANCY!</p>
<p><strong>freddy/snake</strong>: YOU!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: You pulled me in somehow, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: I – I think so!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Then get us back out!</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: Wake up , wake up, wake up –</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: You’re late.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Didn’t get much sleep.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Well, we’ve got –</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Max, where’s Kristen?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: She’s been waiting outside your office since
breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I used to live in this house.</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: But…it’s just a house I’ve dreamed about. I
dream about it all the time. Thank you for what you did last night.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Have you ever done that before? Pulled
someone into your dream?</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: When I was a little girl. Three or four. If
I had a nightmare, I’d bring my Dad in. The dream would always get
better. He always used to tell me about it the next day – he used to
think they were his dreams. NANCY When did it stop?</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: When I was still a kid. My folks got
divorced. After a while, I thought I’d imagined the whole thing. I guess
I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: It’s an amazing gift.</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: That man in my dreams. He’s real isn’t
he?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: He’s real.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Okay, Group’s in session. Straight talk only
in this room.</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: Today I’d like to start by getting us
acquainted with our new staff member, Nancy Thompson. Let’s make her
feel welcome.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Let’s see, you’ve already met Phillip,
Kincaid, and Kristen. Why don’t the rest of you tell Nancy something
about yourselves?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I’m Will Stanton, and um…I’ve had a little
accident, as you can see.</p>
<p><strong>taryn</strong>: Accident my ass. I thought this was supposed
to be straight talk in here.</p>
<p><strong>kincaid</strong>: Hey, so he took a jump. At least he wasn’t
sticking needles in his arms with a bunch of lowlifes.</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: Save it, Kincaid. Jennifer?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I’m Jennifer Caulfield. When I get out of
here I’m going to L.A. to be an actress. i’m gonna be on T.V.</p>
<p><strong>kincaid</strong>: Yeah. Lifestyles of the Rich and
Psychotic.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Screw you. This is Joey. He used to be a
debater in school, but now he doesn’t talk much.</p>
<p><strong>taryn</strong>: I’m Taryn White. I only came here because it
was a better deal than juvie hall. Also, I guess ’cause I’m going
through some very stange shit.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Your dreams?</p>
<p><strong>taryn</strong>: Hey, everybody has bad dreams.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Can I interject something here? Just to
save us all some time?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Go ahead, Phillip.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: According to our kind hosts, our dreams are
a group psychosis. Sort of a mellow mass hysteria. The fact that we all
dreamt about this guy before we ever met doesn’t seem to impress
anybody.</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: And you won’t make any progress until you can
recognize your dreams for what they are.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: And what are they?</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: The by-product of guilt. Psychological scars
steaming from moral conflicts and overt sexuality.</p>
<p><strong>kincaid</strong>: Great. Now it’s my dick that’s killing
me.</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: Tell them, Nancy. Tell them what’s really
going on.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Yes, tell us, Nancy.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: All I can say is this isn’t something that’s
just going to disappear. you’re all going to have to face it. Fight it.
And if you’re willing to work together… wiling to stand up to your
deepest fears…I think we can beat it.</p>
<p><strong>kincaid</strong>: My deepest fear is listening to any more of
this rah-rah bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Okay, you’re attacked by the Bog Demon. Go
ahead.</p>
<p><strong>taryn</strong>: Uh, fourteen.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Doesn’t count. You gotta say the words.</p>
<p><strong>taryn</strong>: This is stupid.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: C’mon.</p>
<p><strong>taryn</strong>: In the name of Elric, Prince of Elves, demon
begone.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Good. You conquer the demon, but your horse is
sinking in the bog. What do you do?</p>
<p><strong>taryn</strong>: I go to bed and get a new horse in the
morning.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: How do I score that? Enchanted slumber or
Death?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Gentlemen. It’s lights out.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Aw, Max…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You know the rules.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Okay, okay.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You too, Joey. ’Night, boys.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You get the first shift tonight.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: This is nice.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Never been here before?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Must have opened while I was away at
school.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Most authentic Mexican food in Springwood,
which isn’t saying much. your parents still live around here?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: My mother’s dead. Died in her sleep.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: My father an I…well, the family just seemed
to fall apart.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Sounds like a rough time.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: It was. Neil, do you believe in other
realities?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: I’ve been to Pittsburgh. Does that count?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I’m serious.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Okay…I believe in different levels of
conciousness, that sort of thing…but if you’re into UFO’s or Atlantis,
you’ve lost me.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: What if I told you your patients are in real
physical danger from their dreams?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: That’s a new one. Is that what they’re
teaching now at Stanford?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: That’s what I know.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: The nightmares are nothing but a symptom of
their real problems.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: All right. Then let’s eliminate the symptom
for the time being.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: With Hypnocyl?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: You want me to prescribe an experimental
psychoactive drug to a bunch of suicidal teenagers?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Just until we get things under control.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Dream deprivation is nothing to fool around
with. you have no business taking it yourself.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I used to be like them, Neil. I know what
they’re going through.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: So do I.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Do you? You told me they’re survivors…and
they are. But how much longer they survive is up to us.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: I’m sorry, Nancy. The answer is no.</p>
<p><strong>kincaid</strong>: Hey Phillip. Wake up, man.</p>
<p><strong>kincaid</strong>: Have a nice stroll, asshole.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Are you crazy? What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Oh shit. Get help.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Joey, what’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: PHILLIP! WAKE UP!</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: I want to talk about what happened last night.
Let’s get all our feelings out in the open.</p>
<p><strong>kincaid</strong>: He wasn’t strong enough. So he got wasted,
that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: That’s all? Is that what you think?</p>
<p><strong>kincaid</strong>: He couldn’t hack it and he got nailed.
Period.</p>
<p><strong>taryn</strong>: Oh yeah, big tough badass. How long you gonna
last?</p>
<p><strong>kincaid</strong>: Longer than any of you.</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: Go ahead and fight. That’s what he
wants.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: You know who. What does he want?</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: To turn us against each other…so we’ll be
weak. Easy prey.</p>
<p><strong>kincaid</strong>: Horseshit.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: No, she’s right.</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: I think we’re all missing the point here.
Phillip’s death was a sleepwalking accident. Nothing more.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I could see him up there. His face. He was
wide awake…all the way down.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Then it was suicide. Phillip quit. He copped
out.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Joey says it wasn’t no suicide.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Joey, listen to me! Phillip killed himself.
And that’s a cowardly thing. An empty thing. he let himself down. he let
all of us down.</p>
<p><strong>taryn</strong>: It was murder! Can’t you understand that?
That bastard murdered him!</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: You never know when he’s going to come.
Sometimes for days, nothing…then –</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: I’ve heard quite enough of this. How long
before you’re ready to face your- selves? How much longer can you keep
blaming your dreams for your own weaknesses?</p>
<p><strong>kincaid</strong>: How much longer you gonna blow smoke up our
ass?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: That’s enough, Kincaid.</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: There will be no repeat occurences of last
night’s events. From now on, your doors will be locked during sleeping
hours. We’ll begin a policy of evening sedation. For everybody.</p>
<p><strong>kincaid</strong>: The fuck you will. Anybody tries to drug me
gets his ass kicked!</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: You just bought yourself a night in the Quiet
Room, mister. Now sit down!</p>
<p><strong>kincaid</strong>: Fuck you! You sit down!</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Easy, Kincaid…</p>
<p><strong>kincaid</strong>: NOBODY’S GONNA PUT ME TO SLEEP!</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: We’ll begin sedation tonight. Starting with
him.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: You can’t! They’ll be defenseless against
their dreams.</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: That’s precisely what they need. Some
uninterrupted REM sleep to release all this negative energy.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Neil, please –</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Elizabeth, I’m prescribing Hypnocyl. It’s a
dream suppressant.</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: I know what it is. I just can’t believe what
I’m hearing. What has she talked you into?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Nothing. They’re my patients. It’s my
decision. I want the dreams stopped until we get some answers.</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: I won’t allow it.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: I’ll go straight to Carver if I have to. He’ll
either back me up or accept my resignation.</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: If soemthing goes wrong, I’ll make sure
you’re held responsible. Fully responsible.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: I can’t believe I just did that.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Do you think we can get the Hypnocyl in by
tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: We’re gonna try.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: I hope you know what you’re getting us
into.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Puttin’ in soem late hours, I see. If you’re
trying for O.T., you’re in the wrong place.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I just wanted to be here for the kids. how
are they?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Restless. Very restless.</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: Nancy? Would you sit with me awhile?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You need me, I’ll be here all night.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Thanks, Max.</p>
<p><strong>lorenzo</strong>: Hi, sweet stuff. Good news.</p>
<p><strong>taryn</strong>: Can’t be good news coming from you.</p>
<p><strong>lorenzo</strong>: Pulled night duty. Trimble’s sick.</p>
<p><strong>taryn</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>lorenzo</strong>: So…got the keys to heaven, baby.</p>
<p><strong>taryn</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lorenzo</strong>: The dispensary. I’m talking clean
pharmaceutical high. A night at Club meth.</p>
<p><strong>taryn</strong>: I don’t do that shit.</p>
<p><strong>lorenzo</strong>: What are these, beauty marks?</p>
<p><strong>taryn</strong>: Those are ancient history.</p>
<p><strong>lorenzo</strong>: Oh yeah? Well, if you’re ever in the mood
for a history lesson, I’m your teacher, understand?</p>
<p><strong>taryn</strong>: Stay out of my face or I’ll go straight to
Max.</p>
<p><strong>lorenzo</strong>: Now who’s gonna take the word of a crazy
junkie chick like you?</p>
<p><strong>taryn</strong>: Fuck off.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Girl, what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Watching TV.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I can see that. You watch too damn much TV.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Research.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Oh, right. You’re gonna be a TV star.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Wait and see.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: If Simms catches you in here after lights out,
she’ll chew my ass ragged.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I gotta stay up, Max.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Jennifer –</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Just tonight, please? I can’t handle the
nightmare. Not tonight. Not after Phillip.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: If you get caught, I never saw you. Deal?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Deal. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: You like gymnastics?</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: I was on the team at school. I was never
very good, though.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: We’re not always as good at things as we’d
like.</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: Yeah, but I was really not good.</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: Yeah, but I was really not good.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: They’ll keep the dreams away. For
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>dick cavett</strong>: Well, that is the great American dream,
isn’t it? To come to L.A. and be a TV star?</p>
<p><strong>sally kellerman</strong>: Well, I suppose it –</p>
<p><strong>kellerman</strong>: – find a good teacher. An actor has to
study, to learn. I think that’s crucial.</p>
<p><strong>freddy/cavett</strong>: WHO GIVES A FUCK WHAT YOU THINK?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: This is it, Jennifer! Your big break in
TV!</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: Don’t be ashamed, young man. This is a place
for sorrow.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Science…I suppose.</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: A sad choice.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: There are times when it doesn’t offer much
comfort. I’ve seen you before. Sister…?</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: Mary Helena.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: You do volunteer work at the hospital?</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: I come from time to time. When I’m needed.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: I could’ve saved them.</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: Only one thing can save the children. The
unquiet spirit must be laid to rest. It is an abomination to God and
Man.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: I beg your pardon?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Neil?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: I was just talking to –</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: To who?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Doesn’t matter.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: C’mon. Let’s get out of this rain.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: I used to think I could do something about
it…make some kind of difference …but they keep slipping through my
fingers.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Stop blaming yourself.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: I’m running out of answers. A patient
sleepwalks out of a security ward up to a tower with no access. A girl,
alone in a room, dies by jumping six feet straight up into a television
set. Nothing makes sense anymore.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Then maybe you’re ready.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: The truth.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Try me.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Only if you’re willing to put aside
everything you’ve learned and trust me. Can you do that?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: I can do that.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Okay. Straigh talk only in here.</p>
<p><strong>taryn</strong>: Is this Group?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Well, unofficially.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Pretty soon there won’t be enough of us left
to call it “Group.”</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Listen up. Nancy’s got something to say.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I know who’s trying to kill you.</p>
<p><strong>kincaid</strong>: Don’t fucking humor us. We’re not in the
mood.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: He wears a dirty brown hat. He’s horribly
burned. He has razors on his right hand.</p>
<p><strong>taryn</strong>: Who is he?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Freddy Krueger. He was a child murderer
before he died. After he died, he became …something worse. Six years ago
Freddy killed my friends. He almost killed me. I thought I got rid of
him – but I guess he was too strong.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Why is he after us?</p>
<p><strong>taryn</strong>: Yeah? What did we ever do?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Not what you did. Your parents. My parents.
They burned him alive. We’re paying for their sins. You’re the last of
the Elm Street children.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Mom and Dad? That’s…crazy. They never
said…</p>
<p><strong>taryn</strong>: Oh sure. That’s just the sorta thing parents
tell their kids: “Goodnight honey. Don’t forget ot say your prayers. Oh,
by the way, your father and I torched some maniac last night.”</p>
<p><strong>kincaid</strong>: So what do we do about this creep?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Last time, it was me against him. I wasn’t
strong enough…alone.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: But together…</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Kristen’s the key. She’s got a very special
talent. A gift.</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: I haven’t been able to do that since I was
a little girl.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: You did it the other night.</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: That was different.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: You never lose a gift like that. You just
forget how to use it. How about it? Will you try?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: You sound like Peter Pan.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Remember – open mind.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Okay, we’re going to try a little group
hypnosis.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Take us there, Kristen.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Breathe deeply and relax…starting with your
toes, relax everything until there’s no tension left in your bodies.
None at all. Keep following the pendulum…</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: We can try again.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Everybody take five.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Look, I was willing to go along with this for
the kids’ peace of mind…and yours. But you’ve got to face reality…</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Neil, let’s try one more time. If it doesn’t
work, then I promise –</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: We’re here.</p>
<p><strong>taryn</strong>: Where…here?</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: Yes. We’re in the dream.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Don’t be silly…we’re in Group…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: In my dreams, I can walk. My legs are
strong.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: We made it. Neil, we made it!</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: This isn’t possible. And even if it is…what
the hell am I doing here? Did you drag me in here too?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Try soemthing, Kristen. What can you do in
your dreams?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: A perfct score! The crowd goes wild!</p>
<p><strong>kincaid</strong>: Fuckin’ A. Dig this.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Kincaid, please. That’s very unnerving.</p>
<p><strong>kincaid</strong>: Hey, check out Taryn.</p>
<p><strong>taryn</strong>: In my dreams, I’m beautiful –</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Take it slowly. Remember, this is a dream.
Anything is possible.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Anything?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Very funny.</p>
<p><strong>kincaid</strong>: Nice dreaming, Doc.</p>
<p><strong>marcie</strong>: Listen, Joey…I just wanted to get you alone
for a second. i mean… Look, I really like you.</p>
<p><strong>marcie</strong>: Do you like my body, Joey?</p>
<p><strong>freddy/marcie</strong>: What’s wrong, Joey? I thought you
liked my body!</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: What’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: He’s close…</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Freddy?</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: He’s heavy in the halls…</p>
<p><strong>taryn</strong>: Where’s Joey?</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: Freddy’s got him! We’ve got to help
him!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: The room’s changing!</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: This is crazy…crazy…</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: What’s going on in here?</p>
<p><strong>nuerosurgeon</strong>: He’s in a deep coma. There’s nothing
we can do for him.</p>
<p><strong>carver</strong>: This is insexcusable.</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: The session was unauthorized. It was
purposely conducted without my knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Unusual steps were called for.</p>
<p><strong>carver</strong>: Is that what I should tell this young man’s
parents? I understand you prescribed a highly experimental drug.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Dr. Carver, he’s not in a coma because of the
Hypnocyl.</p>
<p><strong>carver</strong>: Young lady, your opinion is of no interest
to me. Furthermore, according to Dr. Simms, you’ve been creating panic
among the patients.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: That’s not true.</p>
<p><strong>carver</strong>: Dr. Goldman, in the last four days we’ve had
two suicides. Now a boy is in a coma. I think it’s fair to say your
approach has failed…entirely. You’re both relieved of your duties. I
want you out of here. Today.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Dr. Carver –</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: I’m sorry, Neil. You brought this on
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: For God’s sake, Elizabeth…just try to help the
kids, will you? Listen to them.</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: What are we going to do?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: There’s nothing we can do. It’s out of our
hands.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Sister? Sister!</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Excuse me. Sister?</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: This is where it began.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: This wing’s been closed for years. What was
this place?</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: Purgatory…fashioned by the hands of men.
Twisted, lost souls, the worst of the criminally insane, were locked
away in here like animals.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: The whole facility was shut down in the
Forties, wasn’t it? Some kind of scandal…</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: A young girl on the staff was accidentally
locked in here over the holidays. The inmates managed to keep her hidden
for days. She was raped…hundreds of times. When they found her, she was
barely alive…and with child.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: My God.</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: That girl was Amanda Krueger. Her child –</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Freddy.</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: The bastard son of a hundred maniacs. Some say
he was murdered, though no body was ever found.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: You said something before…about laying him to
rest…?</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: You must find the remains…and bury them in
hallowed ground.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Hallowed ground?</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: If your only faith is science, Doctor… it may
be you that’s laid to rest.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Let him go, you bastard.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Neil…</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: You’re not going in. That’s exactly what he
wants. As long as you’re on Hypnocyl, it’s the only way he can get to
you.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Don’t you think I know that? I don’t have any
choice.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Bullshit. Getting yourself killed won’t do the
kids any good. Besides, we do have a choice.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Assuming your mysterious nun in right.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: I’ve heard crazier things this week.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: All right. Whoever she is, I’ll admit she
seems to know more about Krueger than I do.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: The question is, what happened to Freddy’s
body?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: They burned him to death in his boiler room,
but they were smart enough to hide the remains.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Who would know where they were hidden?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: There’s only one man…and its time for him to
talk.</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: NOOOOOOOO!</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: They weren’t helping you, Kristen. You’re a
sick girl. You can only get better if you trust me now.</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: Get her to the Quiet Room and sedate her!</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: YOU STUPID BITCH! YOU’RE KILLING US!
KILLING US!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Hello Father.</p>
<p><strong>thompson</strong>: Well, if it isn’t my little girl… come to
visit her Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: It’s been a long time.</p>
<p><strong>thompson</strong>: Yeah, but here you are. How’d I get so
lucky? I thought you were trying to forget I was alive.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: That’s not true. You’re the one who’s trying
to forget.</p>
<p><strong>thompson</strong>: Fred Krueger’s dead. You always had a
little trouble understanding that, Princess.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: You know what he did. He’s doing it
again.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: She’s telling the truth.</p>
<p><strong>thompson</strong>: I don’t recall as we ever met, friend. And
I don’t believe this is any of your goddamn business.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I think we can stop him this time. Stop him
for good. But we need to know where the bones were hidden.</p>
<p><strong>thompson</strong>: I lost too much over this already. I’m
through with it.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: People are still dying. After all this time.
Stop running away from it. Daddy, please…don’t make me beg. You owe
me.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Nancy…</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I’ll be okay. Just give me a minute.</p>
<p><strong>taryn</strong>: Doctor Goldman?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Taryn? Is that you? What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>taryn</strong>: You gotta come right away. It’s Kristen. She
had a total shit attack when Simms told us you and Nancy got fired.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Oh Christ. Simms put Kristen in the Quiet Room
for the night. They sedated her.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>taryn</strong>: She’s too doped up to stay awake for long.
She’s alone in there – alone! Freddy’s gonna get her!</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Okay, none of you panic. Just stay cool.
Help’s on the way.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: We’ve got to get over there now. We have to
make Sims understand!</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: You go.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Neil, it’s no use. You saw how he is.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Just go. Kristen needs you. Keep her awake
somehow. Do it.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: I’m Neil Goldman. Pleased to meet you. There,
we’ve met.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Listen up, asshole. I don’t know if you care
whether Nancy lives or dies, but I do. You and I are going on a little
scavenger hunt.</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: Please God…please…</p>
<p><strong>thompson</strong>: What the hell are we doing here?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: I won’t be long.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Oh. Hello.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: What do you think you’re doing?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Look, I’m sorry, but I need this…</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Max, I have ot see Kristen!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Save your breath, Ms. Thompson. Dr. Simms gave
me specific instructions. Nobody gets to see Kristen – especially you.
She made that real clear.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: But Max, she needs me. It could mean life or
death.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Look, I think you really mean well… but my kids
been dyin’ off. Even if I didn’t have orders from Simms, I wouldn’t let
you near her. No way.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Okay, Max…I understand. Can I say goodbye to
the others?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: It’ll be my last chance. Pleese?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You got five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>taryn</strong>: What’d you do, take the scenic route?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Sshhh. No time for that. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Our last Group.</p>
<p><strong>thompson</strong>: In there. Charlie Penny owns the place. We
knew no one would ever find it. I’m not even sure I can find it
again.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: How do we get in?</p>
<p><strong>thompson</strong>: They used to keep a spare key.</p>
<p><strong>thompson</strong>: Hey, Jesse James. Don’t you remember me,
boy?</p>
<p><strong>thompson</strong>: All right. It’s deep in the heart of this
place. Take it slow.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Okay, straight talk only in here.</p>
<p><strong>taryn</strong>: What about Kristen?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: We can’t get to her. I’ve tried.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You mean we’re gonna try to go in with her? To
link up?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: It’s now or never. I won’t kid you. This is
as dangerous as it gets. If you die in the dream, it’s for real. Nobody
has to go in that doesn’t want to.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I’m in.</p>
<p><strong>taryn</strong>: Me too.</p>
<p><strong>kincaid</strong>: Let’s go kick that motherfucker’s ass all
over dreamland.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Now remember – whatever happens, stay
together. That’s the only way we can beat him.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Clear your minds…of everything.</p>
<p><strong>thompson</strong>: That’s it. The Caddy.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Going somewhere?</p>
<p><strong>thompson</strong>: I showed you where the goddamn thing was.
I didn’t say I’d stick around.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: We’ve got work to do.</p>
<p><strong>thompson</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: You’re about to attend a funeral. One that’s
long overdue.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Picture yourselves in the Quiet Room… the
soft white walls…the total silence…just the sound of your hearts
beating. Picture yourself there…with Kristen. I’m going to count
backwards from five. And when I’m done, we’ll all be asleep…we’ll all be
in the Quiet Room.</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: Nancy…</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: Nancy?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: You didn’t think we’d let you go alone?</p>
<p><strong>kincaid</strong>: No fuckin’ way. We’re a team.</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: Joey needs us. I can feel him.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: How do we find him, Kristen?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Whatever happens, stay together!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: HOLD HANDS! FIND EACH OTHER!</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: NANCY!</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Honey, you’ll wake the whole
neighborhood!</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: Mom?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: What are you still doing up? It’s past
one.</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: I thought I’d wait for you.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Well, I’m home now, so you can go right to
sleep. C’mon, angel.</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: I’m just glad you’re home.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: I had such an awful dream.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Elaine? Where do you keep the bourbon?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I’ll be right down. Kris, I’ve got a
guest.</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: Can we talk? Just for a minute?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Can’t it wait till morning?</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: Please Mom? I just don’t want to be
alone.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: BITCH! I SAID WHERE’S THE FUCKING
BOURBON!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: You should listen to your mother,
Kristen.</p>
<p><strong>elaine’s head</strong>: Gaddamn it Kristen, you always ruin
everything! Every time I have a man over you spoil it! You know what
your shrink said! You’re only trying to get attention!</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: Nancy!</p>
<p><strong>taryn</strong>: Kristen? Is that you?</p>
<p><strong>taryn</strong>: Okay asshole. Let’s dance.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Taryn…why should we fight? You and I are old
friends.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Let’s get high.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: What a rush.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Hello? You guys, where are you?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: You look tired, Will. Have a seat.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: No thanks. I’m fine just the way I am.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: For now. But when you wake up… …you’re back
in the saddle again.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: It’s the chair for you, kid.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I’m the Dungeonmaster…the Dungeonmaster…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: In the name of Elric, Prince of Elves – demon
begone!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Sorry kid. I don’t believe in fairy
tales.</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: HELLO? ANYBODY?</p>
<p><strong>nancy’s voice</strong>: Kristen?</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>kincaid</strong>: Yo. I thought I heard voices.</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: Kincaid! I could kiss you!</p>
<p><strong>kincaid</strong>: What’s stopping you?</p>
<p><strong>kincaid</strong>: Cool. So where’s Joey?</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: I don’t know. It’s like a maze in here.</p>
<p><strong>kincaid</strong>: Then it’s time to stop guessin’ and start
messin’. FREDDY! WHERE YOU HIDING, YOU PUSSY?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Kincaid – we should find the others
first…</p>
<p><strong>kincaid</strong>: YOU’RE HOT STIT WITH A LITTLE MUTE KID –
LET’S SEE YOU TAKE A PIECE OF ME! KRUEGER!</p>
<p><strong>kincaid</strong>: – shhhiiiiit.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: This is it. Are you ready?</p>
<p><strong>kincaid</strong>: Let’s snuff the fucker.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Look Joey…all the little piggies have come
home.</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: Joey…</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Let him go.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Your wish is my command.</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: Nancy!</p>
