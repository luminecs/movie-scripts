<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: She isn’t coming yet, Toto. Did she hurt
you? She tried to, didn’t she? Come on - - we’ll go tell Uncle Henry and
Auntie Em. Come on, Toto.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Aunt Em! Aunt Em!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Aunt Em!</p>
<p><strong>aunt em</strong>: Fifty-seven, fifty-eight –</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Just listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto!
She –</p>
<p><strong>aunt em</strong>: Dorothy, please! We’re trying to count!
Fifty-eight–</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh, but Aunt Em, she hit him over the –</p>
<p><strong>uncle henry</strong>: Don’t bother us now, honey – this old
incubator’s gone bad, and we’re likely to lose a lot of our chicks.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh – oh, the poor little things. Oh, but
Aunt Em, Miss Gulch hit Toto right over the back with a rake just
because she says he gets in her garden and chases her nasty old cat
every day.</p>
<p><strong>aunt em</strong>: Seventy – Dorothy, please!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh, but he doesn’t do it every day – just
once or twice a week. And he can’t catch her old cat, anyway. And now
she says she’s gonna get the sheriff, and –</p>
<p><strong>aunt em</strong>: Dorothy! Dorothy! We’re busy!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh – all right.</p>
<p><strong>uncle henry</strong>: Poor little orphan, and her Miss Gulch
troubles. Gosh all hemlock - you know, she ought to have somebody to
play with.</p>
<p><strong>aunt em</strong>: I know, but we all got to work out our own
problems, Henry.</p>
<p><strong>uncle henry</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>aunt em</strong>: Oh, I hope we got them in time.</p>
<p><strong>uncle henry</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: How’s she coming?</p>
<p><strong>hunk</strong>: Take it easy.</p>
<p><strong>hunk</strong>: Ow! You got my finger! CS – Zeke and Hickory
holding wagon bed –</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: Well, why don’t you get your finger out of the
way!</p>
<p><strong>hickory</strong>: Come on - come on - over this way.</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>hickory</strong>: There you are.</p>
<p><strong>hunk</strong>: Right on my finger!</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: It’s a lucky thing it wasn’t your head.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Zeke, what am I going to do about Miss
Gulch? Just because Toto chases her old cat –</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: Listen, honey, I got them hogs to get in.</p>
<p><strong>hunk</strong>: Now lookit, Dorothy, you ain’t using your head
about Miss Gulch. Think you didn’t have any brains at all.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: I have so got brains.</p>
<p><strong>hunk</strong>: Well, why don’t you use them? When you come
home, don’t go by Miss Gulch’s place. Then Toto won’t get in her garden,
and you won’t get in no trouble. See?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh, Hunk, you just won’t listen, that’s
all.</p>
<p><strong>hunk</strong>: Well, your head ain’t made of straw, you
know.</p>
<p><strong>hickory</strong>: Oh! Oh, it feels like my joints are rusted.
Listen, Dorothy, don’t let Hunk kid you about Miss Gulch. She’s just a
poor sour-faced old maid that – she ain’t got no heart left. You know,
you should have a little more heart yourself, and have pity on her.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Well, gee, I try and have a heart.</p>
<p><strong>hickory</strong>: Now look, here’s something that really has
a heart. This is the best invention I ever invented.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: This?</p>
<p><strong>hickory</strong>: Sure. It’s to break up winds, so we don’t
have no more dust storms. Can you imagine what it’ll mean to this
section of the country? I’ll show you. It works perfectly now. Here’s
the principle. You see that fan – that sends up air currents into the
sky. These air currents – Oh, stop it!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>hickory</strong>: Who did it? Now wait a minute.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Hickory!</p>
<p><strong>hickory</strong>: Now what happened? I’ll bet Hunk did
that.</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: Say! Get in there before I make a dime bank
out of you! Listen, kid, are you going to let that old Gulch heifer try
and buffalo you?</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: She ain’t nothing to be afraid of. Have a
little courage, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: I’m not afraid of her.</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: Then the next time she squawks, walk right up
to her and spit in her eye. That’s what I’d do!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh! Oh, Zeke! Help! Help me, Zeke! Get me
out of here! Help!</p>
<p><strong>hickory</strong>: Are you all right, Dorothy?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Yes, I’m all right. Oh – I fell in and - -
and Zeke –</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Why, Zeke, – you’re just as scared as I
am!</p>
<p><strong>hunk</strong>: What’s the matter – gonna let a little old pig
make a coward out of you?</p>
<p><strong>hickory</strong>: Look at you, Zeke – you’re just as white
–</p>
<p><strong>aunt em</strong>: Here, here, what’s all this jabber- wapping
when there’s work to be done? I know three shiftless farm hands that’ll
be out of a job before they know it!</p>
<p><strong>hickory</strong>: Well, Dorothy was walking along the –</p>
<p><strong>aunt em</strong>: I saw you tinkering with that contraption,
Hickory. Now, you and Hunk get back to that wagon!</p>
<p><strong>hickory</strong>: All right, Mrs. Gale. But some day they’re
going to erect a statue to me in this town, and –</p>
<p><strong>aunt em</strong>: Well, don’t start posing for it now. Here,
here – can’t work on an empty stomach. Have some crullers.</p>
<p><strong>hunk</strong>: Gosh, Mrs. Gale.</p>
<p><strong>aunt em</strong>: Just fried.</p>
<p><strong>hickory</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>hunk</strong>: Swell.</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: You see, Dorothy toppled in with the big
Duroc…</p>
<p><strong>aunt em</strong>: It’s no place for Dorothy about a pig sty!
Now you go feed those hogs before they worry themselves into anemia!</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: Yes’am.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Auntie Em, really – you know what Miss
Gulch said she was gonna do to Toto? She said she was gonna –</p>
<p><strong>aunt em</strong>: Now, Dorothy, dear, stop imagining things.
You always get yourself into a fret over nothing.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: No –</p>
<p><strong>aunt em</strong>: Now, you just help us out today, and find
yourself a place where you won’t get into any trouble.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Some place where there isn’t any
trouble.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Do you suppose there is such a place, Toto?
There must be. It’s not a place you can get to by a boat or a train.
It’s far, far away – behind the moon – beyond the rain –</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Somewhere, over the rainbow, way up high,
There’s a land that I heard of once in a lullaby.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: …Someday I’ll wish upon a star And wake up
where the clouds are far behind me.</p>
<p><strong>miss gulch</strong>: Mr. Gale!</p>
<p><strong>uncle henry</strong>: Howdy, Miss Gulch.</p>
<p><strong>miss gulch</strong>: I want to see you and your wife right
away….</p>
<p><strong>miss gulch</strong>: … about Dorothy.</p>
<p><strong>uncle henry</strong>: Dorothy? Well, what has Dorothy
done?</p>
<p><strong>miss gulch</strong>: What’s she done? I’m all but lame from
the bite on my leg!</p>
<p><strong>uncle henry</strong>: You mean she bit you?</p>
<p><strong>miss gulch</strong>: No, her dog!</p>
<p><strong>uncle henry</strong>: Oh, she bit her dog, eh?</p>
<p><strong>miss gulch</strong>: That dog’s a menace to the community.
I’m taking him to the sheriff and make sure he’s destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Destroyed? Toto? Oh, you can’t! You
mustn’t! Auntie Em! Uncle Henry! You won’t let her, will you?</p>
<p><strong>uncle henry</strong>: Of course we won’t. Will we, Em?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Please, Aunt Em, Toto didn’t mean to. He
didn’t know he was doing anything wrong. I’m the one that ought to be
punished. I let him go in her garden. You can send me to bed without
supper –</p>
<p><strong>miss gulch</strong>: If you don’t hand over that dog, I’ll
bring a damage suit that’ll take your whole farm! There’s a law
protecting folks against dogs that bite!</p>
<p><strong>aunt em</strong>: How would it be if she keeps him tied up?
He’s really gentle – with gentle people, that is.</p>
<p><strong>miss gulch</strong>: Well, that’s for the Sheriff to decide.
Here’s his order allowing me to take him. Unless you want to go against
the law.</p>
<p><strong>uncle henry</strong>: Uhh – yeah –</p>
<p><strong>aunt em</strong>: Now, we can’t go against the law, Dorothy.
I’m afraid poor Toto will have to go.</p>
<p><strong>miss gulch</strong>: Now you’re seeing reason.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: No –</p>
<p><strong>miss gulch</strong>: Here’s what I’m taking him in – so he
can’t attack me again.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh, no, no! I won’t let you take him! You
go away, you….! Oooh, I’ll bite you myself!</p>
<p><strong>aunt em</strong>: Dorothy!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: You wicked old witch! Uncle Henry, Auntie
Em, don’t let ’em take Toto! Don’t let her take him – please!</p>
<p><strong>miss gulch</strong>: Here! I’ve got an order! Let me
have…</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Stop her!</p>
<p><strong>aunt em</strong>: Put him in the basket, Henry.</p>
<p><strong>miss gulch</strong>: The idea!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh, don’t, Uncle Henry. Oh, Toto!
Don’t…</p>
<p><strong>aunt em</strong>: Almira Gulch, just because you own half the
county doesn’t mean you have the power to run the rest of us! For
twenty- three years, I’ve been dying to tell you what I thought of you!
And now – well, being a Christian woman, I can’t say it!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Toto, darling! Oh, I got you back! You came
back! Oh, I’m so glad! Toto!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh, they’ll be coming back for you in a
minute. We’ve got to get away! We’ve got to run away – quick!</p>

Him</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Well, well, well – house guests, huh? And
who might you be? No, no – now don’t tell me.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Let’s see – you’re – you’re travelling in
disguise. No, that’s not right. I – you’re – you’re going on a visit.
No, I’m wrong. That’s…You’re – running away.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: How did you guess?</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Professor Marvel never guesses – he
knows! Now, why are you running away?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Why –</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: No, no – now don’t tell me. They – they
don’t understand you at home. They don’t appreciate you. You want to see
other lands – big cities – big mountains – big oceans –</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Why, it’s just like you could read what was
inside of me.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Yes –</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Please, Professor, why can’t we go along
with you?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: …polite! We haven’t been asked yet.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: He’s perfectly welcome. As one dog to
another, huh? Here now – let’s see where were we?</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Oh, yes - you - you wanted to go home,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh, no, I wanted to go along with you.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Oh –</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Nobody cares about me at home. They
wouldn’t even miss me.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Aw, come, come, come –</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: No, they won’t - honestly.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Oh –</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Auntie Em was even going to let them kill
Toto yesterday for biting Miss Gulch. Oh, please, Professor, why can’t
we go with you and see all the Crowned Heads of Europe?</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Do you know any? Oh, you mean the thing -
- Yes, well, I – I never do anything without consulting my crystal
first. Let’s….</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: …go inside here – we’ll – Just come
along. I’ll show you. There you are - right in there.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: That’s right. Here – sit right down here.
That’s it. Ha ha! This – this is the same genuine, magic, authentic
crystal used by the Priests of Isis and Osiris in the days of the
Pharaohs of Egypt – in which Cleopatra first saw the approach of Julius
Caesar and Marc Anthony, and – and so on – and so on. Now, you – you’d
better close your eyes, my child, for a moment – in order to be better
in tune with the infinite. We – we can’t do these things without….</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: …infinite. Yes.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: That’s – that’s all right. Now you can
open them. We’ll gaze into the crystal. Ahh – what’s this I see? A house
– with a picket fence….</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: …and a barn – with a weather vane and a –
of a – of a running horse.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: No - it’s - it’s - a crowing rooster.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: That’s our farm!</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Oh – yes.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Yes, there’s – there’s a woman – she’s….
INSERT – CU of the photograph - -</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: …she’s wearing a polka-dot dress….</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: …her face is careworn.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Yes…That’s Aunt Em.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Her – her name is Emily.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: That’s right. What’s she doing?</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Well, I – I can’t quite see. Why, she’s
crying.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh –</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Someone has hurt her – someone has just
about broken her heart.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Well, it’s – it’s someone she loves very
much. Someone she’s been very kind to. Someone she’s taken care of in
sickness.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: I had the measles once – and she stayed
right by me every minute.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: What’s she doing now?</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Well, she’s - she’s going into a little
bed…. CU - Dorothy - Camera shooting past Professor -</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: …room –</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Has it poppies on the wall…. MCU -
Professor - Camera shooting past Dorothy</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: …paper?</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: I said it had poppies on the wall paper!
Eh – she’s – What’s this? Why, she’s – she’s putting her hand on her
heart – she’s – she’s dropping down on the….</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: …bed.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh, no – no!</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: That’s all – the Crystal’s gone dark.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh, you….</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: …you don’t suppose she could really be
sick, do you? Oh – Oh, I’ve got to go home right away!</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: But – what’s this? I thought you were
going along with me.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh, no, no, I have to get to her
right….</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: …away! Come on, Toto! Oh, what’ll I do? If
we go home, they’ll send you to the Sheriff. And if we don’t, Aunt Em
may – well, she may die! I know what I’ll do - I’ll give you to Hunk.
He’ll watch out for you. But we’ve got to hurry. Goodbye, Professor
Marvel – and thanks a lot!</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Better get under cover, Sylvester –
there’s a storm blowing up – a whopper, to speak in the vernacular of
the peasantry. Poor little kid – I hope she gets home all right.</p>
<p><strong>uncle henry</strong>: Hunk, get them horses loose! Where’s
Hickory. Hickory! Hickory! Doggone it! Hick –</p>
<p><strong>uncle henry</strong>: Hey, what are you doing there?</p>
<p><strong>hickory</strong>: This is my chance! The cyclone is coming.
Let me show you what my machine can do! You see, it goes –</p>
<p><strong>uncle henry</strong>: Doggone you! Help Hunk get them horses
loose!</p>
<p><strong>hickory</strong>: All right - you’ll be sorry.</p>
<p><strong>uncle henry</strong>: Go on, hurry up! Hurry up, I tell
you!</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: She’s here – it’s a twister! ELS – The Gale
Farm – Cyclone approaching –</p>
<p><strong>aunt em</strong>: Dorothy! Dorothy!</p>
<p><strong>uncle henry</strong>: Come on – everybody in the storm
cellar!</p>
<p><strong>aunt em</strong>: Henry! Henry! I can’t find Dorothy! She’s
somewhere out in the storm! Dorothy!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Auntie Em! Auntie Em!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: We’re not on the ground, Toto!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: We must be up inside…. MCS – Toto looks out
from under bed – DOROTHY o.s.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Toto – I’ve a feeling we’re not in Kansas
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: We must be over the rainbow!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Now I – I know we’re not in Kansas.</p>
<p><strong>glinda</strong>: Are you a good witch, or a bad witch?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Who, me? Why, I’m not a witch at all. I’m
Dorothy Gale from Kansas.</p>
<p><strong>glinda</strong>: Oh! Well….</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Who, Toto?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Toto’s my dog.</p>
<p><strong>glinda</strong>: Well, I’m a little muddled. The Munchkins
called me because a new witch has just dropped a house on the Wicked
Witch of the East. And there’s the house, and here you are, and that’s
all…</p>
<p><strong>glinda</strong>: …is, are you a good witch, or a bad
witch?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh, but I’ve already told you, I’m not a
witch at all – witches are old and ugly. What was that?</p>
<p><strong>glinda</strong>: The Munchkins. They’re laughing because I am
a witch. I’m Glinda, the Witch of the North.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: You are! Oh, I beg your pardon! But I’ve
never heard of a beautiful…. MCU – Glinda looks to r.f.g. and speaks –
DOROTHY o.s.</p>
<p><strong>glinda</strong>: Only bad witches are ugly.</p>
<p><strong>glinda</strong>: The Munchkins are happy because you have
freed them from the Wicked Witch of the East.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh. But, if you please – what are
Munchkins?</p>
<p><strong>glinda</strong>: The little people who live in this land –

<p><strong>group</strong>: In the hall of fame!</p>
<p><strong>munchkins</strong>: Tra la la la la</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: I thought you said she was dead.</p>
<p><strong>glinda</strong>: That was her sister – the Wicked Witch of
the East. This is the Wicked Witch of the West. And she’s worse than the
other one was.</p>
<p><strong>witch</strong>: Who killed my sister? Who killed the Witch of
the East? Was it you? Answer me!</p>
<p><strong>glinda</strong>: Leave her alone!</p>
<p><strong>witch</strong>: You stay out of this! I’m here for vengeance!
So it was you, was it? You killed her,….</p>
<p><strong>witch</strong>: …didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: No – No! It was an accident! I didn’t mean
to kill anybody!….</p>
<p><strong>witch</strong>: Didn’t mean it, eh? Accident, eh? Well, my
little pretty, I can cause accidents, too – and this is how I do it!
GLINDA o.s.</p>
<p><strong>glinda</strong>: …ting the ruby slippers?</p>
<p><strong>witch</strong>: The slippers – yes…..the slippers!</p>
<p><strong>witch</strong>: They’re gone!</p>
<p><strong>witch</strong>: The ruby slippers! What have you done with
them? Give them back to me, or I’ll - –</p>
<p><strong>glinda</strong>: It’s too late! There they….</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>witch</strong>: I’m the only one that knows how to use them.
They’re of no use to you! Give them back to me!</p>
<p><strong>glinda</strong>: Keep tight inside of them – their magic must
be very powerful, or she wouldn’t want them so badly!</p>
<p><strong>witch</strong>: You stay out of this, Glinda, or I’ll fix you
as well!</p>
<p><strong>glinda</strong>: Oh, rubbish! You have no power here. Be
gone, before somebody drops a house on you, too.</p>
<p><strong>witch</strong>: Very well – I’ll bide my time – and as for
you, my fine lady, it’s true, I can’t attend to you here and now as I’d
like, but just try to stay out of my way…. MCU – Witch threatens Dorothy
o.s. in f.g. –</p>
<p><strong>witch</strong>: … – just try! I’ll get you, my….</p>
<p><strong>glinda</strong>: It’s all right. You can get up – she’s
gone.</p>
<p><strong>glinda</strong>: It’s all right. You can all get up.</p>
<p><strong>glinda</strong>: Pooh – what a smell of sulphur! I’m afraid
you’ve made rather a bad enemy of the Wicked Witch of the West. The
sooner you get out of Oz altogether, the safer you’ll sleep, my
dear.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh, I’d give anything to get out of Oz
altogether – but which is the way back to Kansas? I can’t go the way I
came.</p>
<p><strong>glinda</strong>: No – that’s true. The only person who might
know would be the great and wonderful Wizard of Oz himself!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: The Wizard of Oz? Is he good or is he
wicked?</p>
<p><strong>glinda</strong>: Oh, very good, but very mysterious. He lives
in the Emerald City, and that’s a long journey from here. Did you bring
your broomstick with you?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: No, I’m afraid I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>glinda</strong>: Well, then, you’ll have to walk. The
Munchkins will see you safely to the border of Munchkinland. And
remember, never let those ruby slippers off your feet for a moment, or
you will be at the mercy of the Wicked Witch of the West.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: But, how do I start for Emerald City?</p>
<p><strong>glinda</strong>: It’s always best to start at the beginning –
and all you do is follow the Yellow Brick Road.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: But – what happens if I — CS – Glinda
speaks to Dorothy o.s. in f.g. –</p>
<p><strong>glinda</strong>: Just follow the Yellow Brick Road.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: My – ! People come and go so quickly here!
Follow the Yellow Brick Road. Follow the Yellow Brick Road?</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Follow the Yellow Brick Road.</p>
<p><strong>1st munchkin</strong>: Follow the Yellow Brick Road.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Follow the Yellow Brick Road.</p>
<p><strong>barrister</strong>: Follow the Yellow Brick Road.</p>
<p><strong>fiddlers</strong>: Follow the Yellow Brick Road. Follow the
Yellow Brick Road. Follow, follow, follow, follow, Follow the Yellow
Brick Road. Follow the Yellow Brick Follow the…</p>
<p><strong>fiddlers</strong>: …Yellow Brick</p>
<p><strong>fiddlers</strong>: You’re off to see the Wizard The Wonderful
Wizard of Oz!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Follow the Yellow Brick Road? Follow the
Yellow….?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Now which way do we go?</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: That way is a very nice way. CS –
Scarecrow, his arm pointing to right –</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Who said that?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Don’t be silly, Toto. Scarecrows….</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: …don’t talk.</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: It’s pleasant down that way, too.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: That’s funny. Wasn’t he pointing the other
way?</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: …go both ways!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Why….</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: …you did say something, didn’t you? CS- The
Scarecrow shakes his head, then nods - -</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Are you doing that on purpose, or can’t you
make up your mind?</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: That’s the trouble. I can’t make up my
mind. I haven’t got a brain – only straw.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: How can you talk if you haven’t got a…. MCU
– Scarecrow speaks to Dorothy o.s.in f.g. – DOROTHY o.s.</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: I don’t know. But some people without
brains do an awful lot of talking, don’t they?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Yes, I guess you’re right.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Well, we haven’t really met properly, have
we?</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: Why, no.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: How do you do?</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: How do you do?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Very well, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: Oh, I’m not feeling at all well. You see,
it’s very tedious being stuck up here all day long with a pole up your
back. MCU – Dorothy –</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh, dear – that must be terribly
uncomfortable. Can’t you get down?</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: Down? No, you see, I’m – Well, – I’m
–</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh, well, here – let me help you.</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: Oh, that’s very kind of you – very
kind.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Well, oh, dear – I don’t quite see….</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: Of course, I’m not bright about doing
things, but if you’ll just….</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh….</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: …yes.</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: Ohhhh –</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Ohh!</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: Whhhooops! Ha-ha – there goes some of me
again!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh – does it hurt you?</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: Oh, no – I just keep picking it up and
putting it back in again.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Ohhh –</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: My, it’s good to be….</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: …free!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh! Oh! Ohhh!</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: Did I scare you?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: No, No – I – I just thought you hurt
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: But I didn’t scare you?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: No – of course not.</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: I didn’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: Boo! You see, I can’t even scare a crow!
They come from miles…. MCU – Dorothy listening – SCARECROW o.s.</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: Oh, I’m a failure, because I haven’t got
a brain.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Well, what would you do with a brain if you
had one?</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: Do? Why, if I had a brain, I could – I
could while away the hours, Conferrin’ with the flowers, Consultin’ with
the rain. And my head I’d be scratchin’ While my thoughts were busy
hatchin’ If I only had a brain. I’d unravel every riddle For any
individ’le</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: With the thoughts you’ll be thinkin’ You
could be another Lincoln If you only had a brain.</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: Oh, I could tell you why The ocean’s near
the shore I could think of things I never thunk before,</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: …Life would be a ding-a-derry If I only
had a brain!</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: Gosh, it would be awful pleasin’ To
reason out the reason For things I can’t explain. Then perhaps I’ll
deserve you, And be even worthy erv you If I only had a brain.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Wonderful! Why, if our Scarecrow back in
Kansas could do that, the crows’d be scared to pieces!</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: They would?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Um-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: Where’s Kansas?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: That’s where I live. And I want to get back
there so badly I’m going all the way to Emerald City to get the Wizard
of Oz to help me.</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: You’re going to see a Wizard?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Um-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: Do you think if I went with you this
Wizard would give me some brains?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: I couldn’t say. But even if he didn’t,
you’d be no worse off than you are now.</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: Yes – that’s true.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: But maybe you’d better not. I’ve got a
witch mad at me, and you might get into trouble.</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: Witch? Huh! I’m not afraid of a witch!
I’m not afraid of anything — except a lighted match.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: I don’t blame you for that.</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: But I’d face a whole box full of them for
the chance of getting some brains. Look - - I won’t be any trouble,
because I don’t eat a thing – and I won’t try to manage things, because
I can’t think. Won’t you take me with you?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Why, of course I will!</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: Hooray! We’re off to see a Wizard!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh – well – you’re not starting out very
well.</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: Oh, I’ll try! Really, I will.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: To Oz?</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: To Oz!</p>
<p><strong>both</strong>: We’re off to see the Wizard The Wonderful
Wizard of Oz We hear he is a whiz of a Wiz If ever a Wiz there was If
ever oh ever a Wiz there was, The Wizard of Oz</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh – apples – Oh look! Oh. Oh —</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Ouch!</p>
<p><strong>tree</strong>: What do you think you’re doing?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: We’ve been walking a long ways and I was
hungry and – Did you say…. MCU – The First Tree – gestures as it speaks
–</p>
<p><strong>first tree</strong>: She….</p>
<p><strong>first tree</strong>: …was hungry! Well, how would you like to
have someone come along and pick something off of you?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh, dear – I keep forgetting I’m not in
Kansas.</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: Come along, Dorothy – you don’t want any
of those apples. Hmm! MCU – First tree reacts, and speaks –</p>
<p><strong>first tree</strong>: What do you mean - she doesn’t want any
of those apples? Are you hinting my apples aren’t what they ought to be?
MCU - - Scarecrow and Dorothy –</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: Oh, no! It’s just that she doesn’t like
little green….</p>
<p><strong>tree</strong>: Oh….</p>
<p><strong>tree</strong>: …you…</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: Go – Go!</p>
<p><strong>tree</strong>: …Oh – Help – let me out. I’ll give you little
green….</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: I’ll show you how to get apples. TREE
o.s.</p>
<p><strong>tree</strong>: …do that to me! I’ll….</p>
<p><strong>trees</strong>: You can’t do that! You can’t do that!
Hey!</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: Hooray! I guess that did it! Help
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh –</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Why, it’s a man! A man made out of tin!</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Yes. Oh – look –</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: Oil can…..Oil can….</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Did you say something?</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: Oil can….</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: Oil can what?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oil can? Oh – oh, here it is!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Where do you want to be oiled first?</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: My mouth – my mouth!</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: He said his mouth.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Here – here –</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: The other side….</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Yes — there.</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: Mm…..mm…mm….</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: …m…m…my, my, my, my goodness – I can talk
again! Oh – oil my arms, please – oil my elbows.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh…</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: Oh –</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: …Oh, did that hurt?</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: No – it feels wonderful. I’ve held that axe
up for ages. Oh —</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh, goodness! How did you ever get like
this?</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: Oh – well, about a year ago – I was
chopping that tree – minding my own business – when suddenly it started
to rain….</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: …and right in the middle of a chop, I…I
rusted solid. And I’ve been that way ever since.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Well, you’re perfect now.</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: My…my neck. My…my neck. Perfect? Oh – bang
on my chest if you think I’m perfect. Go ahead – bang on it!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh –!</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: Beautiful! What an echo!</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: It’s empty. The tinsmith forgot to give me
a heart.</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: No heart.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh –</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: All hollow. Oh –</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: When a man’s an empty kettle, He should be
on his mettle. And yet I’m torn apart. Just because I’m presumin’ That I
could be kind-a human, If I only had a heart.</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: I’d be tender – I’d be gentle And awful
sentimental Regarding Love and Art I’d be friends with sparrows…</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: …And the boy who shoots the arrows If I
only had a heart. Picture me….a balcony….Above a voice sings low.</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: I hear a beat….how sweet! Just to register
emotion Jealousy – Devotion – And really feel the part, I could stay
young and chipper, And I’d lock it with a zipper, If I only had a
heart…!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh –</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, are you all
right?</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: I’m afraid I’m a little rusty yet.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh, dear – That was wonderful! You know –
we were just wondering why you couldn’t come to Emerald City with us to
ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart.</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: Emerald City? Why, that’s a long and
dangerous journey. And it might rain on the way.</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: But you’ve just been saying how much you
want a heart.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: And I’ll keep the oil-can handy.</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: Well, suppose the Wizard wouldn’t get me
one when we got there?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh, but he will! He must! We’ve come such a
long way already.</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: Ohh – what’s that? Oh –</p>
<p><strong>witch</strong>: You call that long?</p>
<p><strong>witch</strong>: Why, you’ve just begun! Forgotten about
me,….</p>
<p><strong>witch</strong>: Helping the little lady along, are you, my
fine gentlemen?</p>
<p><strong>witch</strong>: Or I’ll stuff a mattress with you!</p>
<p><strong>witch</strong>: Here, Scarecrow! Want to play ball?</p>
<p><strong>witch</strong>: And as for you, my little….</p>
<p><strong>witch</strong>: …happy journey back to Kansas!</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: I’m not afraid of her. I’ll see you get
safely to the Wizard now, whether I get a brain or not! Stuff a mattress
with me! Hah!</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: I’ll see you reach the Wizard, whether I
get a heart of not. Bee-hive – bah! Let her try and make a bee-hive out
of me! You know – Hmm? What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: Oh! They’re - they’re gone now.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh, goodness! Did any of them sting
you?</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: I - I guess they tried to, but they bent
their stingers.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh, dear. I don’t know what I’d do if a
whole swarm kept – Oh! Oh! Oh, there’s one on me!</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: Oh - I’ll get it!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh! Oh!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh –</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: Oh, see - I killed it. Oh, I killed that
poor little honey bee!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh-oh-</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: It’s only a man without a head who could do
a thing like that. Poor little bee. CU - Dorothy reacts - reaches o.s.

<p><strong>tin man</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: …just that the Witch is so wicked. I don’t
think you two ought to come with me because you’ll get into trouble.</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: Oh, you don’t think we’re going to stand
by and let her get away with fireballs and bees, do you?</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: No, sir!</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: No, sir!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh, you’re the best friends anybody ever
had! And it’s funny, but I feel as if I’ve known you all the time. But I
couldn’t have, could I?</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: I don’t see how. You weren’t around when
I was stuffed and sewn together, were you?</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: And I was standing over there rusting for
the longest time.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Still, I wish I could remember. But, I
guess it doesn’t matter anyway. We know each other now, don’t we?</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: We do.</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: To Oz?</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: To Oz!</p>

because, because, because, because Because of the wonderful things he
does We’re off to see the Wizard The Wonderful Wizard of Oz!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: I don’t like this forest! It’s – it’s dark
and creepy!</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: Of course, I don’t know, but I think
it’ll get darker before it gets lighter.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Do – do you suppose we’ll meet any wild
animals?</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: We might.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh –</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: Animals that – that eat straw?</p>

<p><strong>lion</strong>: Put ’em up! Put ’em….</p>
<p><strong>lion</strong>: …up! Which one of you first? I’ll fight you
both together if you want! I’ll fight you with one paw tied behind my
back. I’ll fight you standing on one foot.</p>
<p><strong>lion</strong>: I’ll fight you with my eyes closed. Oh –
pulling an axe on me, eh? MCU – Tin Man trembling –</p>
<p><strong>lion</strong>: Sneaking up on me, eh? Why!</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: Here – here. Go ’way and let us alone!</p>

<p><strong>lion</strong>: How long can you stay fresh in that can? Come
on – get up and fight, you shivering junk yard! Put your hands up, you
lop-sided bag of hay!</p>

him.</p>

<p><strong>lion</strong>: Why, I’ll – Foul! Foul!</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: Help! Help! Help! Help! Help!</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: Oh! Well, what happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: They tore my legs off, and they threw
them over there! Then they took my chest out, and they threw it over
there!</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: Well, that’s you all over.</p>
<p><strong>lion</strong>: They sure knocked the stuffings out of you,
didn’t they?</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: Don’t stand there talking! Put me
together! We’ve got to find Dorothy!</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: Now, let’ s see – this goes – Oh, I wish I
were better at puzzles.</p>
<p><strong>lion</strong>: Wait a minute. This is the left one. He walks
bad enough already.</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: Oh, poor Dorothy. We may never see her
again.</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: Who do you suppose they were? And where
did they take her? A fine thing - to go to pieces at a time like
this!</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: Now, now, don’t fret.</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: Oh, dear, dear.</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: We’ll get you together!</p>
<p><strong>witch</strong>: What a nice little dog! And you, my dear.
What an unexpected pleasure!</p>
<p><strong>witch</strong>: It’s so kind of you to visit me in my
loneliness.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: What are you going to do with my dog? Give
him back to me!</p>
<p><strong>witch</strong>: All in good time, my little pretty – all in
good time.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh, please give me back my dog!</p>
<p><strong>witch</strong>: Certainly – certainly – when you give me
those slippers.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: But the Good Witch of the North told me not
to.</p>
<p><strong>witch</strong>: Very well! Throw that basket in the river and
drown him!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: No! No – no! Here – you can have your old
slippers – but give me back Toto.</p>
<p><strong>witch</strong>: That’s a good little girl. I knew you’d see
reason.</p>
<p><strong>witch</strong>: Ahh! Ah!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: I’m sorry. I didn’t do it! Can I still have
my dog?</p>
<p><strong>witch</strong>: No! Fool, that I am! I should have remembered
– those slippers will never come off, as long as… CU – Dorothy reacts –
speaks – WITCH o.s.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: What are you gonna do? CU - Witch looks up
o.s. - speaks -</p>
<p><strong>witch</strong>: What do you think I’m going to do? But that’s
not what’s worrying me – it’s how to do it. These things must be done
delicately….</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Run, Toto, run!</p>
<p><strong>witch</strong>: Catch him, you fool!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: He got away! He got away!</p>
<p><strong>witch</strong>: Ohhh! Which is more than you will! Drat you
and your dog!</p>
<p><strong>witch</strong>: You’ve been more trouble to me than you’re
worth, one way or another – but it’ll soon be over now!</p>
<p><strong>witch</strong>: Do you see that? That’s how much longer
you’ve got to be alive! And it isn’t…. CU – Dorothy crying – WITCH
o.s.</p>
<p><strong>witch</strong>: I can’t wait forever to get those shoes! CU –
Dorothy crying – exits left –</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: There. Now, that’s the best we can do
without any pins.</p>
<p><strong>lion</strong>: Yeah –</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: Oh, don’t worry about me. I’m all right.
We must worry about Dorothy.</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: But how can we find her? We don’t even know
where she is. Look! There’s….</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: Why, don’t you see? He’s come to take
us….</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: …to Dorothy!</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: Oh –</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: Come on, fellows!</p>
<p><strong>lion</strong>: Oh – Oh – Oh – I….</p>
<p><strong>lion</strong>: …I – I – I hope my strength holds out.</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: I hope your tail holds out. Oh –</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Someday, I’ll wake and rub my eyes And in
that land beyond the skies You’ll find me —-</p>
<p><strong>lion</strong>: What’s that? What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: Oh, I hate to think of her in there. We’ve
got to get her out.</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: Don’t cry now. We haven’t got the oil-
can with us and you’ve been squeaking enough as it is.</p>
<p><strong>lion</strong>: Who’s them? Who’s them?</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: I’ve got a plan how to get in there.</p>
<p><strong>lion</strong>: Fine. He’s got a plan</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: And you’re going to lead us.</p>
<p><strong>lion</strong>: Yeah. Me?</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: Yes, you.</p>
<p><strong>lion</strong>: I – I – I – I – gotta get her outta there?</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>lion</strong>: All right, I’ll go in there for Dorothy –
Wicked Witch or no Wicked Witch – guards or no guards – I’ll tear ’em
apart. I may not come out alive, but I’m going in there. There’s only
one thing I want you fellows to do.</p>
<p><strong>lion</strong>: Talk me out of it.</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: No, you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: Oh, no!</p>
<p><strong>lion</strong>: No? Now, wait a minute.</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: You don’t neither –</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: Up!</p>
<p><strong>lion</strong>: Now…</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: I’m frightened, I’m frightened, Auntie Em –
I’m frightened!</p>
<p><strong>auntie em</strong>: Dorothy – Dorothy – where are you? It’s
me – it’s Auntie Em. We’re trying to find you. Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: I – I’m here in Oz, Auntie Em. I’m locked
up in the Witch’s castle….and I’m trying to get home to you, Auntie Em!
Oh, Auntie Em, don’t go away! I’m frightened! Come back! Come back!</p>
<p><strong>witch</strong>: Auntie Em – Auntie Em – come back! I’ll give
you Auntie Em, my pretty!</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: Sssh – Toto – be quiet –</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: Whew! That wasn’t my plan - but something
happened, didn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: You put up a great fight, Lion.</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: Yeah –</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: I don’t know what we’d have done without
you.</p>
<p><strong>lion</strong>: Hah. I - I must have bitten you a couple of
times.</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: Come on – I’ve got another idea.</p>
<p><strong>lion</strong>: Do – do you think it’ll be polite – dropping
in like this?</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: Come on – come on.</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: Where do we go now?</p>
<p><strong>lion</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: There!</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: Wait! We’d better make sure. Dorothy, are
you in there?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Yes, it’s me! She’s locked me in!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh, I knew you’d get here in time!</p>
<p><strong>lion</strong>: Listen, fellows. It’s her. We gotta get her
out! Open this door!</p>
<p><strong>lion</strong>: …the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open
the door! Open the door!</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: Don’t push!</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: Stop pushing!</p>
<p><strong>lion</strong>: Oh - I was only trying to help. Ohhh!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh, hurry – please hurry!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: …ty!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh – Oh – Oh! Toto – Toto!</p>
<p><strong>lion</strong>: Did they hurtcha?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Lion, darling – I knew you’d come!</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: Dorothy!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: I knew you would!</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: Hurry – we’ve got no time to lose!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>witch</strong>: …hear of it. Why, my little par-….</p>
<p><strong>lion</strong>: Trapped! Trapped like mice – er – rats! MLS -
The Winkies advancing -</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: Go ahead - do something! Roar! Roar!</p>
<p><strong>lion</strong>: What good’ll it do us?</p>
<p><strong>witch</strong>: That’s right. Don’t hurt them right away.
We’ll let….</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>witch</strong>: Seize….</p>
<p><strong>witch</strong>: They’ve gotten away! Stop them! Stop
them!</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: It’s no use trying the doors again! Which
room is it?</p>
<p><strong>lion</strong>: They’re coming back!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Ohhh!</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: Oh - upstairs, quickly!</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: Go on!</p>
<p><strong>witch</strong>: There they go! Ah – now we’ve got them! Half
you go that way – half you go that way!</p>
<p><strong>witch</strong>: Go! Go!</p>
<p><strong>lion</strong>: Where – where do we go now?</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: This way! Come on!</p>
<p><strong>witch</strong>: Well – ring around the rosy – a pocket full
of spears! Thought you’d be pretty foxy, didn’t you? Well, I’m going to
start in on you right here - one after the other!</p>
<p><strong>witch</strong>: How about a little fire, Scarecrow?</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: No – No – No – No!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Ohh! OHH! OHH!</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: Help! I’m burning! I’m burning! I’m
burning! Help! Help! Help!</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: Help!</p>
<p><strong>witch</strong>: Ohhh – you cursed brat! Look what you’ve
done! I’m melting! Melting! Oh - - what a world – what a world! Who
would have thought a good little girl like you could destroy my
beautiful wickedness!? Ohhh! Look out! Look out! I’m going. Ohhhh!
Ohhhhhh….</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: She’s….she’s….dead! You’ve killed her!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: I – I didn’t mean to kill her….really I
didn’t! It’s…it’s just that he was on fire!</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Hail to Dorothy! The Wicked Witch is
dead!</p>
<p><strong>winkies</strong>: Hail! Hail to Dorothy – The Wicked Witch is
dead!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: You mean, you’re…you’re all happy about
it?</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Very happy - now she won’t be able to hit us
with a broom….</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: The broom!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: May we have it?</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Please! And take it with you!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh – thank you so much! Now we can go back
to the Wizard and tell him the Wicked Witch is dead!</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: The Wicked Witch is dead!</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: The Wicked Witch is dead! The Wicked Witch is
dead!</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: Hail - hail - the Wicked Witch is dead!</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: Ding Dong! The Witch is dead. Which old
Witch?</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: Wake up, you sleepy head Rub your eyes</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: She’s gone where the Goblins go Below – below –
below! Yo ho, let’s open….</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: …up and sing</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: …low.</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: …witch?</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: Wake up, you sleepy head. Rub your eyes -</p>
<p><strong>oz’s voice</strong>: Can I believe my eyes? Why….</p>
<p><strong>oz’s voice</strong>: …have you come back?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Please, sir. We’ve done what you told us.
We’ve brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West. We
melted her.</p>
<p><strong>oz’s voice</strong>: Oh ….</p>
<p><strong>oz’s voice</strong>: …you liquidated her, eh? Very….</p>
<p><strong>oz’s voice</strong>: …resourceful!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Yes, sir. So we’d like you to keep your
promise to us, if you please, sir.</p>
<p><strong>oz’s voice</strong>: Not so fast! Not…. MLS – Throne –</p>
<p><strong>oz’s voice</strong>: …so fast! I’ll have to give the matter a
little thought. Go away and come back tomorrow!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Tomorrow? Oh, but I want to go home
now.</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: You’ve had plenty of time already!</p>
<p><strong>lion</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>oz’s voice</strong>: Do not arouse the wrath….</p>
<p><strong>oz’s voice</strong>: …of the Great and Powerful Oz! I said -
- come back tomorrow!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: If you were really great and powerful,
you’d keep your promises!</p>
<p><strong>oz’s voice</strong>: Do you presume to criticize the….</p>
<p><strong>oz’s voice</strong>: …Great Oz? You ungrateful creatures!</p>
<p><strong>oz’s voice</strong>: Think yourselves lucky that I’m….</p>
<p><strong>oz’s voice</strong>: …giving you audience tomorrow, instead
of….</p>
<p><strong>oz’s voice</strong>: …twenty years from now. Oh – oh oh! The
Great Oz has spoken! Oh – Oh — ….</p>
<p><strong>oz’s voice</strong>: … Oh …. Oh ….</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>oz’s voice</strong>: Oh - I - Pay no….</p>
<p><strong>oz’s voice</strong>: …attention to that man behind the
curtain. Go - before I lose my temper! The Great and Powerful —….</p>
<p><strong>oz’s voice</strong>: … – Oz – has spoken!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>oz’s voice</strong>: Well, I – I – I am the Great and
Powerful – Wizard of Oz.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: You are?</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: Uhhhh – yes…</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: I don’t believe you!</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: No, I’m afraid it’s true. There’s no other
Wizard except me.</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: You humbug!</p>
<p><strong>lion</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: Yes-s-s – that…that’s exactly so. I’m a
humbug!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh ….</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: …you’re a very bad man! MCU – The Wizard
reacts, speaks humbly –</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: Oh, no, my dear – I’m – I’m a very good man.
I’m just a very bad Wizard.</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: You’d better be good enough to send
Dorothy back to Kansas!</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: Uh - now, please don’t be angry with me.
I’ll - I’ll do anything you say, only… only if you don’t shout at me. It
makes me nervous!</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: It makes you nervous?</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: What about us?</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: Well, I –</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: What about the heart that you promised
Tin Man –?</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: Well, I –</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: – And the courage that you promised
Cowardly Lion?</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: Well, I –</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: Well, I– but you’ve got them. You’ve had
them all the…</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: …time!</p>
<p><strong>all together</strong>: Oh, no we haven’t!</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: You don’t get around us that easy!</p>
<p><strong>lion</strong>: Not nohow!</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: Well –</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: You promised us real things – a real…</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: …brain!</p>
<p><strong>lion</strong>: Real courage. That’s what we want.</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: You do? boys, you’re aiming low. You not
only surprise, but you grieve me.</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: Why, anybody can have a brain. That’s a very
mediocre commodity. Every pusillanimous creature that crawls on the
earth – or slinks through slimy seas has a brain!</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: From the rock-bound coast of Maine to the
Sun…. oh - oh, no – – ah - Well, be that as it may. Back where I come
from we have universities, seats of great learning – where men go to
become great thinkers. And when they come out, they think deep thoughts
– and with no more brains than you have…. But! They have one thing you
haven’t got! A diploma!</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: Therefore, by virtue of the authority vested
in me by the Universitatus Committeeatum e plurbis unum, I hereby confer
upon you the honorary degree of Th.D.</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: Th.D.?</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: Yeah – that…that’s Dr. of Thinkology!</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: The sum of the square roots of any two
sides of an isosceles triangle is equal to the square root of the
remaining side. Oh joy, rapture! I’ve got a brain!</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: How can I ever thank you enough?</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: Well, you can’t. As for you, my fine friend
– you’re a victim of disorganized thinking. You are under the
unfortunate delusion that simply because you run away from danger, you
have no courage. You’re confusing courage with wisdom. Back where I come
from, we have men who are called heroes. Once a year, they take their
fortitude out of mothballs and parade it down the main street of the
city. And they have no more courage than you have. But! They have one
thing that you haven’t got! A medal! Therefore – for meritorious….</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: …conduct, extraordinary valor, conspicuous
bravery against wicked witches, I award you the Triple Cross.</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: You are now a member of the Legion of
Courage!</p>
<p><strong>lion</strong>: Oh – Oh – shucks, folks, I’m speechless!</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: As for you, my galvanized friend, you want a
heart! You don’t know how lucky you are not to have one. Hearts will
never be practical until they can be made unbreakable. I could have been
a world figure, a power among men, a - a successful wizard, had I not
been obstructed by a heart.</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: But I still want one.</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: Yes – ….</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: …back where I come from there are men who do
nothing all day but good deeds. They are called phil…er – er – phil –
er, yes…good-deed-doers. And their hearts are no bigger than yours. But!
They have one thing you haven’t got! A testimonial!</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: Therefore, in consideration of your
kindness, I take pleasure at this time in presenting you with a small
token of our esteem and affection. And remember, my sentimental
friend….</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: …that a heart is not judged by how much you
love, but by how much you are loved by others.</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: Ahh — Oh, it ticks! Listen!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Yes…!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: …yes.</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: Look – it ticks!</p>
<p><strong>lion</strong>: Read…read what my medal says.</p>
<p><strong>lion</strong>: Courage!…</p>
<p><strong>lion</strong>: …Ain’t it the truth! Ain’t it the truth!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh – oh – they’re all wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: Hey – what about Dorothy?</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: Yes – how about Dorothy?</p>
<p><strong>lion</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: Ah –</p>
<p><strong>lion</strong>: Dorothy next!</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: Yes. Dorothy – ah – Dor – CU – Dorothy –</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh, I don’t think there’s anything in that
black bag for me.</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: Well, no - no – on the contrary, on the - —
….</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: …I – ah – on the contr – – Here – Well, you
force me into a cataclysmic decision. The only way to get Dorothy back
to Kansas is for me to take her there myself! CU – Dorothy reacts,
speaks –</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh, will you? Could you? Oh – but are you a
clever enough Wizard…. MCU – The Wizard – DOROTHY o.s.</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: Child – you cut me to the quick! I’m an old
Kansas man myself…born and….</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: …excellence to the Miracle Wonderland
Carnival Company – until one day, while performing spectacular feats of
stratospheric skill never before attempted by civilized man, an
unfortunate phenomena occurred. The balloon failed to return to the
fair.</p>
<p><strong>lion</strong>: It did?</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: Yes. There was I, floating through space - -
a man without a continent! CU – Dorothy –</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Weren’t you frightened?</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: Frightened? You are talking to a man who has
laughed in the face of death – sneered at doom and chuckled at
catastrophe. I was petrified. Then suddenly the wind changed, and the
balloon floated down into the heart of this noble city, where I was
instantly acclaimed Oz, the First Wizard de Luxe!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Ohhh!</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: Times being what they were, I accepted the
job, – retaining my balloon against the advent of a quick get-away. And
in that balloon, my dear Dorothy, you and I will return to the land of E
Pluribus Unum!</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: Good people of Oz, this is positively the
finest exhibition ever to be shown –</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: – yes – well – be that as it may – I, your
Wizard par ardua ad alta, am about to embark upon a hazardous and
technically unexplainable journey into the outer stratosphere.</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: To confer, converse, and otherwise hob- nob
with my brother wizards. And I hereby decree that until what time – if
any – that I return, the Scarecrow, by virtue of his highly superior
brains, shall rule in my stead…assisted by the Tin Man, by virtue of his
magnificent heart…and the Lion – by virtue of his courage! Obey them as
you would me! And - ah - well, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh, come back here! Toto!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Come back! Oh, don’t go without me! I’ll be
right back! Toto!</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: Stop that dog!</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: This is a highly irregular procedure! This
is absolutely unprecedented!</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: Oh! Help me! The balloon’s going up!</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: – Ruined my exit!</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: Help!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh! Come back! Don’t go without me! Please
come back!</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: I can’t come back! I don’t know how it
works!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh –</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: Goodbye, folks!</p>
<p><strong>oz people</strong>: Goodbye! Goodbye!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh, now I’ll never get home!</p>
<p><strong>lion</strong>: Stay with us, then, Dorothy. We all love you.
We don’t want you to go.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh, that’s very kind of you – but this
could never be like Kansas. Auntie Em must have stopped wondering what
happened to me by now. Oh, Scarecrow, what am I going to do?</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: Look – here’s someone who can help
you!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh, will you help me? Can you help me?</p>
<p><strong>glinda</strong>: You don’t need to be helped any longer.
You’ve always had the power to go back to Kansas.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: I have?</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: Then why didn’t you tell her before?</p>
<p><strong>glinda</strong>: Because she wouldn’t have believed me. She
had to learn it for herself.</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: What have you learned, Dorothy?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Well, I – I think that it – that it wasn’t
enough just to want to see Uncle Henry and Auntie Em – and it’s that –
if I ever go looking for my heart’s desire again, I won’t look any
further than my own backyard. Because if it isn’t there, I never really
lost it to begin with! Is that right?</p>
<p><strong>glinda</strong>: That’s all it is!</p>
<p><strong>scarecrow</strong>: But that’s so easy! I should have thought
of it for you.</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: I should have felt it in my heart.</p>
<p><strong>glinda</strong>: No. She had to find it out for herself. Now,
those magic slippers will take you home in two seconds!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh….</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: …Toto, too?</p>
<p><strong>glinda</strong>: Toto, too.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh, now?</p>
<p><strong>glinda</strong>: Whenever you wish.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh, dear – that’s too wonderful to be true!
Oh, it’s – it’s going to be so hard to say goodbye. I love you all, too.
Goodbye, Tin Man. Oh, don’t cry. You’ll rust so dreadfully. Here –
here’s your oil-can. Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>tin man</strong>: Now I know I’ve got a heart – ’cause it’s
breaking.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh – Goodbye, Lion. You know, I know it
isn’t right, but I’m going to miss the way you used to holler for help
before you found your courage.</p>
<p><strong>lion</strong>: Well – I would never’ve found it if it hadn’t
been for you.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: I think I’ll miss you most of all.</p>
<p><strong>glinda</strong>: Are you ready now?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Yes. Say goodbye, Toto.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Yes, I’m ready now.</p>
<p><strong>glinda</strong>: Then close your eyes, and tap your heels
together three times.</p>
<p><strong>glinda</strong>: And think to yourself – “There’s no place
like home; there’s no place like home; there’s no place like home.”</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: There’s no place like home. There’s no
place like home. There’s no place like home. There’s no place like

Well….</p>
<p><strong>uncle henry</strong>: She got quite a bump on the head – we
kinda thought there for a minute she was going to leave us.</p>

just the trouble. And I tried to get back for days and days.</p>
