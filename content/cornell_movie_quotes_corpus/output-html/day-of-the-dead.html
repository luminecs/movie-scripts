<p><strong>dead</strong>: by George A. Romero</p>
<p><strong>montage</strong>: as MORE GATORS explore the empty streets,
knocking over GARBAGE CANS, upsetting the MANNEQUINS in A DEPARTMENT
STORE WINDOW. A GATOR crawls out through the open doors of AN ABANDONED
BANK. LOOSE BILLS are dragged along under the animal’s tail. They
flutter away on the WIND.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Another dead place. I tol’ you. Let’s get out
to the islands.</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: The radio signals were coming from this
area.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Not from the city. In every city it’s the
same. Dead. Let’s get out to the barrier islands. If there are survivors
sending those signals that’s where we’ll find them.</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: Plenty of time for the islands. The rest of
our…life…on the islands…I think.</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: We gotta see if there are others here. We
came all this way. We’re gonna check it out.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Ptoooo! Nothing! Dry as a bone. No gas. Let’s
get outa here.</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: Check them all. And check the tanks under
the pumps.</p>
<p><strong>montage</strong>: as THE WALKING DEAD hear that human VOICE.
Throughout the city they turned towards THE SOUND, at once confused and
excited.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Dios mia.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: I tol’ him. I tol’ him this is a dead place.
Like all the others.</p>
<p><strong>bullets rip into the attackers chest: he falls out of the
trawler</strong>: onto the dock, but TWO MORE GUNMEN appear behind him,
mean-looking desperadoes with RIFLE SPITTING LEAD.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I have to stop the infection… Querrida…</p>
<p><strong>bites deep but doesn’t cut through. she lifts it and chops
again and</strong>: AGAIN….THUCK! THUCK! Then SHE DIGS AROUND, searching
for the joint the way she might on a turkey drumstick. Finding the spot,
SHE PUSHES DOWN WITH BOTH HANDS, leaning all her weight on the top edge
of the blade. TEARS are running down her cheeks when THE BIG KNIFE</p>
<p><strong>attacker #1</strong>: You could use our guns, maybe. We can’t
use yours. Unless you can get yer boat back here.</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: You got a boat.</p>
<p><strong>attacker #1</strong>: Shit, man. We can drift this tub into
the bay…tow her around with a dinghy…but she ain’t gonna get us nowhere.
Ev’ry boat you see here is long dead, soldier…else we’d be long gone.
Can you get your boat back here?</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: I don’t know where they went, man. I don’t
know. I swear.</p>
<p><strong>attacker #1</strong>: Then, like I said…we can’t use you. We
ain’t got the food nor the patience to put up with you.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Help me get him to the boat.</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: Leave him.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Help me or die.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Aaaaaaah…my God…my God…I am heartily sorry…for
having offended Thee….offended Thee…</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Shhhhh….Tony. Rest, rest.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: I detest all my sins…because… because of Thy
just punishment… because of Thy…just…punish…</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: He is dying. I will end his pain.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: …but most of all because…they offend Thee, my
God…Who art all good…and deserving…deserving of all my love…</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: He is dying. He knows it.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: You are dying, too.</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: No. The disease was cut away from me. I will
live. I will live.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: I firmly resolve…with the… with the help…the
help of…of Thy grace…</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Tony…TONY!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: It must be done. You know this. It must by
done to keep him from…</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: It won’t happen to him! It won’t happen to
him! You heard his prayer. His prayer will save him. He could never
become one of…one of those… devils.</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: Prayers have no power to save. The knife can
save. It can cut the disease away. The bullet. It can shatter the brain
where the evil takes seed. These are saviours…our new saviours…our only
saviours.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: We must wait. One day the curse will pass.
One day a dead man will… will…</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: One day a dead man will refuse to return,
and that man will be a saint. The first saint of our century. That’s a
prayer, too. A catechism. Something the priests tell us to believe.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: You can believe this, Miguel. I’ll kill you
if you shoot. We must wait. I’ll….I’ll do it….I’ll do it myself….when it
needs to be done.</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: No. You won’t be able to do it. He will
rise. He will rise and you… you will die.</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: It looks uninhabited. What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: I think we should burn the church. Kill the
priest and burn the church. It’s the only way. The only way.</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: I’m pullin’ in.</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: What’s he saying?</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: His madness….could be from shock.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: No. I didn’t stop the infection in time. I
know. Don’t worry. When he dies, I won’t be like Maria. I’ll shoot
him.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: No. No shooting. Not until we’re sure we’re
alone on this island.</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: No. No, thank you. No ice. Straight up,
please. No ice. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: Burn the church. Kill the priest and burn
the church. Burn….</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: I dunno. Landing pad for a helicopter? I
dunno.</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: It’s some kind of….elevator. There must be
something under the ground here….maybe….military.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Look.</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: What do we do? Let’em know we’re here….or
what?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Let’s just….wait a minute. Get a better
look.</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: It can’t be. Are we truly in hell?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: What is that? Could that be….?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: No. They must have gotten them to
accept….other things. They wouldn’t be feeding them with….they
wouldn’t…</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: You’ll get used to this, Tyler. It’s the
only way. They don’t bite the hand that feeds.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: We have visitors. Let’s go men.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Hah! If only the rest of you ladies would
obey orders the way they do.</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: Kill the priest.</p>
<p><strong>another round hits miguel in the stomach. another creases his
head.</strong>: He tries to stand up but he’s too weak. A BULLET IN THE
NECK stops his screaming. Then HE’S HIT IN THE HEART. A BALL OF BLOOD
PROJECTS OUT OF HIS MOUTH and he plops onto his back, dead.</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: Yes…yes, do it…please…you can’t let me die
this way…please. Destroy me. A bullet…in the head…I don’t want to
become…one of…one of them.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Take his weapon, Tyler.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Take his gun, ass hole. He still has the
strength to pull a trigger.</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: Please…senor…destroy me…one
bullet…please.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Maybe. We’ll have a little talk first.
Then….maybe…I can help you out. String him up.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: They can handle it, Tyler. You’ve been
buckin’ for a shit detail lately so here’s one you’re gonna love. We’ve
got two dead. Cut the heads off and get the bodies underground to the
refrigerators. Fast. It’s a hot day.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Tyler. Just our men. Not him.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: His head stays where it is. He and I never
really had the chance to get acquainted. When he comes back…I’ll get
another shot at it… Ha ha ha ha…</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: Please….shoot me.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: And if I don’t? If I don’t you’ll come back
after your death. You’ll come back and find yourself hanging
there…wanting to eat…needing to eat human flesh. You hate that thought,
don’t you? That’s the ultimate sin for most of you fools, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: After hanging up there a few days you will
be mad for food…crazed! You will lust for it! YOU WILL BE WORSE THAN ANY
OF THEM!</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: I’ll bargain with you. How many of you are
on the island?</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: Two of us…only two of us…me…and him.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: I don’t believe you, rebel. Where are your
headquarters? On the mainland?</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: The mainland…is dead…a dead place…nobody
there…</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Where are your headquarters, rebel? Tell me
or I’ll let you hang there forever…FOREVER!</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: There are no…headquarters. There are
no…rebels. Only the walking dead. Don’t you see. They have won.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Then why did you come here?</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: To look…look for a place…a place to live
in…an empty place…a… new…place…</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: How did you know we were on this island? Do
others know? Will others come?</p>
<p><strong>chico</strong>: Nooooo. Believe me. There are no others…no
rebels…nobody…it’s over…it’s ooooo….</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Where are you going, Tyler?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: My…“detail”, sir. We’re going to bury the
heads.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: No time for that. I’ll take care of
them.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Just….following procedure, sir. They’re
entitled to burial.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: I said, I’ll take care of them. Just leave
them there. Go help with the rest of the gear.</p>
<p><strong>close</strong>: as RHODES’ GLOVED HAND jams A HAND GRENADE
into THE CAPTIVE ZOMBIE’S gaping mouth. THE SOLDIER WITH THE POLE
releases the noose and the two men take off, running.</p>
<p><strong>through the binoculars</strong>: We see THE ZOMBIE staggering
in the bush, clawing desperately at the thing jammed in its mouth.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Goddammit, somebody’s gonna tell me who
fired that shot or I’ll have every last one of you chopped up for
feed!!!</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Step up here, Tyler.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Sir!</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: You fired that shot, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Let me see your weapon.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: It’s been fired.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: In the battle, sir.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: It may be that none of these chicken-shits
will talk while the whole troop is present…but I know some of these men
well. I’m sure that a few private conversations will tell me what I
already know. You may have earned yourself some time in the Stalag,
Tyler. Cut him down. That’s another head for you to chop off. Leave it
with the others. Take the rest of his body down to the freezers. Move
it, shit hill.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It’s alright. It’s alright. Don’t be afraid.
We’re friends.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: There are soldiers near here. Guards. I’ll
take my hand away if you won’t scream.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Right. We better get away from that Bee. He
might have friends.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Bees. That’s what we call the dead… the
walking dead…here on Gasparilla’s island.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Gasparilla?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: He was a pirate who sailed these waters long
ago. His name is bein’ borrowed these days by the long lost Henry
Dickerson.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Governor Dickerson? Of Florida?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That’s the man. He’s been holed up here ever
since the shit hit the fan. Him and his family owned these islands
‘round here. They was leasin’ this one to the Fed. The whole underneath
is dug out. There was missiles here and laboratories and bomb proof
housing, nuclear power, all o’ that. Now this is
Dickerson’s….Gasparilla’s… private fortress. Him and a bunch o’ his
cronies from all the best golf courses in Tallahassee…and his private
army, of course.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: We ran up against a platoon of soldiers.
There were actually walking dead…in uniform…with guns.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Captain Rhodes and his Red Coat Bees. They
could sting, sister. We know you came up against ‘em. We been watchin’
you since you landed. Couldn’t help. I’m sorry for that. We ain’t
supposed to be outside. If we was spotted it could….well, it could be
the end of everything.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Give that to me. Get behind me. Stay behind
me.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Thanks. I can fight my own battles.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I know you can. Like I said, we been watchin’
you.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: We found nine entrances to the Cave so far,
and we ain’t got the whole thing near charted yet. That’s what we was
doin’ out here today. Huntin’ for entrances.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: The man I was with…until today… believed that
praying was for blind men who couldn’t see the truth.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: How we gonna break the curse without a prayer
or two.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Curse?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What is it if it ain’t a curse?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: It’s a disease. It’s a…a bug…a parasite that
infects the brain.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That sounds like a curse to me.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: We thought we were escaping here. We thought
we’d found an uninhabited island. Christ! This place is a worse
nightmare than anything I’ve seen yet!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m sure that’s true, miss. And that’s why
we’re doin’ what we’re doin’. What’s happenin’ underground here is just
what Lucifer planned for this sinful race o’ man. But we’re gonna beat
Lucifer. We’re gonna put an end to what’s happenin’ here.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Oh, what did I run into? A bunch o’ Jesus
nuts? Religiosos? Prayer won’t stop a bullet from one of those storm
troopers and prayer won’t keep one of those monsters from eatin’ your
liver for lunch.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That’s why we didn’t use prayers on this here
white coat ’til after he was destroyed. We ready to fight when we have
to. And we gotta fight now.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Look. I BEEN fightin’, mister. I been
fightin’ for what feels like a hundred years and I’m finished. I don’t
need religion. I don’t need prayers. I need a couple guns and a couple
hands. We can sail on outa here. Find another island where there ain’t
so much….traffic.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You think you can find your boat? There’s a
thousand little inlets and backwaters all through here. You remember all
the ways you turned to get where you are now? You leave yourself a
trail?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: We didn’t see the exact spot but we know about
where you landed. But we ain’t ready to take you there. Not yet. You
see…we need guns, too.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I can find it myself. I didn’t come that
far.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Farther than you think. You’ll get lost. You
will. And there’s Bees all through the jungle. I ain’t lyin’ to ya.
Religiosos don’t lie.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: No. They just try to hold you for ransom.
Fuck you, Moses! I’m outa here!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: We don’t need her guns that bad. Billy
boy.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: We’ll split up. Billy, you go with Spider.
Just an hour or two tonight, that’s all. Rhodes might have extra guards
on after all the commotion. We’ll meet up at number six and go back home
together.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Are you gonna pause to say words over the
dead this time or can we be on our way?</p>
<p><strong>montage</strong>: OTHER VIDEO SCREENS on MONITORS in various
places throughout the huge underground facility. ZOMBIES watch the
screens gathered in groups of four, six and eight, like children in
ranked classes.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: There’s activity in the dormitory!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: This is Mary Henried. Did anyone enter the
dormitory?</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: THE MOUTH OF A LARGE PLASTIC BAG. A HAND
wearing A BLACK LEATHER GLOVE pulls A HUMAN HEAD out of a bag by its
hair. It’s the head of one of the dead soldiers from Rhode’s platoon.
The hand belongs to RHODES himself.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Take it, friend. Take it. It’s a present.
From me to you.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Just remember who gives you favours.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Well, Bub. I’ve heard about you. Miss
Henried’s pride and joy.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Surly sonofabitch. I want to make friends,
Bub. Friends. I have one more goodie in my sack here.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Come, come, Miss Science. You’ve seen
worse.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: God….damn you, Rhodes!</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: God has damned us all. Are my atrocities
worse than yours?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You have ruined weeks of work here! We’ve been
trying to wean these specimens onto alligator meat!</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: No wonder they’re so….hungry.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I didn’t realise! Those were de-caps! I
didn’t know that….de-caps… revived!</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Any dead whose brains are intact will
revive.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: But…we bury the heads. Oh. God! It must be
torture for them!</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: They are brutes without feeling. Though I
admit that I’ve requested cremation for myself. Burial is an archaic
tradition, even more ridiculous now than it ever was. To say nothing of
the…spacing problem…on a small island like this.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I thought the purpose of decapitation was
to…to…</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: The purpose of decapitation is to preserve
as much…food…as possible. The purpose for feeding is to keep the beasts
on our side. The fact that they can be taught to clean up our garbage or
to fire a gun is a convenient side benefit, not the primary goal. The
primary goal is to keep ourselves from becoming their supper. Keep them
fed and they behave. Keep them hungry and they revert back to being the
animals that they have always been. You saw them in there.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You gave them a fresh taste of blood!</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: They will never be satisfied with anything
else, Miss Henried. They want human flesh. I’m prepared to take whatever
steps are necessary to see to it they don’t get mine! Not while I’m
still using it!</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Did you know? About the de-caps?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’d never seen it before.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: But you knew.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: What else is there, doctor? What else do you
people know that the rest of us don’t?</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: You can’t run away from the planet, Miss
Science. You can’t even run away from the island, heh heh.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Leave me alone, you…COCKSUCKER!!!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You’re….you’re disgusting! You’re….FILTH!</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: And you’re the one who builds the bomb and
they says, ‘I hope it’ll never actually be used’.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Julie Grant is a behaviouralist. She’s not
medical. She hasn’t been as…exposed to…to things…as some of the rest of
us. She’ll be alright. I’ll talk to her. She’ll be alright.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Oh, I have no doubt.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: If you put her on the shit list because of her
reaction here tonight I’ll go to Dickerson.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Ah, yes, our noble Gasparilla does seem to
favour you lately. I understand he assigned you a roommate of your
choice. The rest of us have to pick names out of a hat.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Rhodes, you and I had a roll in the hay
together when I first got here. It was a wholly unsatisfying experience
which I do not want to, and which I never will repeat! So give up,
mister! I’m going home…to that roommate you mentioned.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Take your hands off me! Right now!</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Maybe you’ll change your mind when it starts
getting too lonely for you.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: I’m not entirely without influence myself,
Miss Science. I had your roommate assigned…by Gasparilla… to my platoon.
What’s his name? Tyler? Yes. Toby Tyler.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: I had an unfortunate little run-in with him
today. In fact…you might say that Mr. Tyler is in big trouble with
the…authorities.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You better not mess with me, Rhodes. I’d love
to serve your balls to those Red Coats for lunch! Think about it!</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: No, Miss Science. You’re the one who needs
to do some thinking.</p>
<p><strong>montage</strong>: as MARY walks through HUGE OPEN AREAS
CARVED OUT OF NATURAL ROCK. We are stunned at the enormity of the place.
JEEPS AND TRUCKS RUMBLE back and forth. Storage areas hold MOUNTAINS OF
CRATES, CARTONS, WATER AND GAS CANISTERS. FORK LIFTS shift loads from
here to there.</p>
<p><strong>the sound of life, music blasting, voices laughing, arguing,
crying.</strong>: PEOPLE move by. A MAN AND A WOMAN are fighting. She
slaps him, he punches her, she kicks him in the balls. THREE HOOKERS
pound on a door. The door is opened by A NAKED MAN WEARING A DILDO on
his nose. OTHER MEN, behind him, laugh wildly as the hookers enter their
smoke- filled room.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Toby…thank God…wait here. I gotta find out
what’s goin’ on.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Hey. Slow down. What is it?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Some of Rhodes’ men. At the door.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: That bastard. I didn’t think he’d make his
move so fast.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: It’s because of me.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Oh, bullshit, Mary. It’s because Rhodes is a
prick.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I want you to leave. Then maybe…</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: We’re both gonna leave. Leave the island. I’ve
been talkin’ to Tricks. We think we can smuggle out one of those
inflatable rafts. They’re crated up real small. They’ve got air
canisters. There’s food inside. Even a little motor.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I am not…a guerilla fighter, Toby. I’m not a
pioneer. I’m not…I’m not strong that way. I need…</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Need what? Civilised order like we have down
here? Christ!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I can work here. Maybe my work can help…help
everyone. I can do more good with access to this equipment than I can
off in some wasteland.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: For the good of mankind. That’s what every
monster-maker says.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: We’re gettin’ out. Me and Tricks. I want you
to come with us. I want that more than anything. I’ll send word. I’ll
let you know a time and a place to meet. We probably won’t be able to
wait around so if you’re not there on the dot…well…if you’re not there,
I’ll know you’re not comin’.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I don’t know what they’re gonna do to me. I
figure they’ll just send me out to Stalag Seventeen but if…if it’s worse
than that…Tricks will know. Stay in touch with Tricks.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: You Tyler?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: You’re under arrest. I’ll take your
weapon.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What’s he supposed to have done? What are the
charges?</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Dunno, ma’m. We’re on orders.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Look…I’m Mary Henried. I’m with the special
conditioning center. I’m not without influence…</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Mary.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’ll have somebody’s ass for this. I’ll have
your ass, soldier. I’m not gonna stand here and…</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: MARY!</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I’ll be alright. Just remember the things I
said. Take care of yourself.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: The fences make a safe pathway to Stalag
Seventeen. That’s where we live. That’s where you gonna live, too.
Hell’s half acre. It’s not a nice place. Them boys there is prisoners.
What’s their punishment? They sent out to the Stalag for a few weeks.
That’s punishment enough.</p>
<p><strong>pregnant woman</strong>: How ’bout it, baby. I’m big but I’m
beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: This is home, darlin’. Home for us that don’t
make the grade. Us that ain’t…good enough to live inside The Cave. We
grow a little food, do a little light manufacturin’…like these here
vests, we make these for the massers. We live in our own filth, with
bugs and snakes and disease and jungle fever…all the time waitin’ to
become breakfast for the Bees.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It’s a tunnel. It’s a couple hundred yards.
Just keep goin’ ’til you reach the end. I’ll be right behind you.</p>
<p><strong>lukey</strong>: Doc Logan! Doc Logan! Dere’s a lady dead out
dere! Gotta hurry! Gotta hurry! Dunno how long she been dat way! Maybe
she gettin’ ready to come back.</p>
<p><strong>electric drill with a long bit. whzzzzzzzzz! he drives the
spinning</strong>: BIT INTO THE DISEMBODIED HEAD, DEEP INTO ITS BRAIN.
When he pulls it out, MATTER FLIES as the motor winds down.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Bury the head. Call the guard for the rest.
Get it off the table for now. We’ll bring this new one in.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>diesel</strong>: The tunnel.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: God. It’s almost sun-up.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Who are you? Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It’s OK. It’s OK, Doc. She’s with us.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: This here’s the hospital. That’s Diesel over
there, the big guy. This here’s Lukey and that’s Doc Logan who’s about
to cut your tonsils out.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: This here’s all the weapons we got. That’s why
your fancy automatic looks so good to us. We gotta stick it over here
with the others for now. They catch us with any kind o’ weapon and its
death without even askin’ your name.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Ammunition. You got ammunition in your pack
there? I hope you do or the gun ain’t worth much.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: We better just hide the whole pack, darlin’.
That stuff is just shoutin’ out that it come from the mainland. The shit
we get is all C.D. rations. Aspirins and crackers from 1958.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Let’s go. You look like you could use some
shut eye. Me too. We can all get acquainted tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: How do we know she’s alright? How do we
know?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: How do we know she’s alright? How do we
know?</p>
<p><strong>diesel</strong>: Are you alright, Doc? You look… you look
real bad.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I have looked bad for four years. Everyone in
the world has looked bad for four years. Thank God looks don’t matter as
much as they once did.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: This just ain’t your day, is it, darlin’
Sarah.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Three more minutes. Then you can sleep. You
gotta stay with it for three more minutes.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: How do we know she’s alright? How do we
know?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: They supply us with disinfectant and dope.
Sex, drugs and rock-and-roll. What more could anyone ask for? Most
around here ain’t interested in changin’ their lives. The folks you
met…me and them and a couple others is the whole rebel army. Nobody else
gives a shit…and they’re afraid o’ Rhodes.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: They seem to be havin’ a good time. Some
punishment.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You disappear in here, darlin’. You get a
knife in yer belly or too much shit in yer veins. You get lost out here
and nobody’s gonna notice. Rhodes, he counts on that. It all makes for
food in the freezers.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: This is your hotel. I’m not gonna stay here
with you but I’ll always be close. You gonna hafta take care o’ yourself
like you said you was able to do.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Some may notice that you’re new. Just deny it.
You’ll get away with it. Nobody really looks at each other around here.
Go on in. Get some sleep.</p>
<p><strong>fisher</strong>: Alright! Way ta go, Kemosabe!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: They won’t learn to use forks if they don’t
like the breakfast you’re serving, Ted.</p>
<p><strong>fisher</strong>: The fork is like a game to them. If they get
into the game maybe they’ll learn to like the food.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: It won’t work.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: It’s alright! Leave him alone!</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: A TARGET, a flat, cut out silhouette of a
man, BLACK TRIANGLES painted on the instant-kill-zones, brain, heart.
BULLETS STRIKE the neck, the to torso, SOME RICOCHET off the wall
behind. None hit the kill-zones.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Have you seen Julie Grant this morning?</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: She should be in the behaviour
rooms.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: She’s not. Hasn’t shown up yet.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Good morning, Bub.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: I think he wants you to watch.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: OK, Bub. Do your stuff.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Very good, Bub. That’s….very good.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Where the hell have you been?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Julie. Are you alright? You were missed this
morning. I need you. I don’t want you getting your ass in hot water. I
won’t be able to help you if…</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I don’t need any help from you!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Julie…JULIE!</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: He was found with a government-issue
short- wave transmitter in his quarters. He’s charged with the theft of
that equipment from a government installation and with possession of an
illegal radio.</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: I can only suggest that the court rule
in favour of the ultimate penalty for this traitor.</p>
<p><strong>gasparilla</strong>: You always recommend the ultimate
penalty, Tommy Lee. You and Rhodes.</p>
<p><strong>gasparilla</strong>: All those…AGAINST…the ultimate penalty
raise yer hands.</p>
<p><strong>gasparilla</strong>: Ya mean ta say nobody’s gonna object to
the ultimate penalty in this here case? Well, what if I object? What if
I object to the ultimate penalty.</p>
<p><strong>gasparilla</strong>: There’s been a whole lotta swingin’
influence and swingin’ weight arountyere lately. Does anybody at all
give two shits fer what I think any more? Well, I’m a- gonna let this
guy off. How d’yall like that? And I want the word ta git out I let ’im
off. I let ’im off. Not this council. Maybe I can improve my image
rountyere.</p>
<p><strong>gasparilla</strong>: Yer sentenced ta hard labour. Stalag
Seventeen. A year.</p>
<p><strong>gasparilla</strong>: Well, Miss Henried, what a coincidence.
You’re just in time fer a case that seems ta concern you. Guess you
didn’t care about the other proceedin’s we been dealin’ with here this
mornin’.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’m sorry. I was…busy. In the lab.</p>
<p><strong>gasparilla</strong>: Well, you managed ta make it here jus’
in time fer this case, didn’t ya?</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Sir. In the matter of the State versus
Private Tyler, I don’t want to…</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Sir, Tyler is innocent of any crime against
the State. Captain Rhodes is…</p>
<p><strong>gasparilla</strong>: Miss Henried, I think you better…</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: …Captain Rhodes is trying to…</p>
<p><strong>gasparilla</strong>: MISS HENRIED, SHUT THE HELL UP!!!</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: I don’t want to take up a lot of time with
this. Mr Tyler shot a prisoner against orders. There are eyewitnesses.
I’ve reprimanded Tyler and I’ve had him sent outside. It’s as simple as
that.</p>
<p><strong>gasparilla</strong>: Ya had ’im sent ta the Stalag? That’s
all ya did to ’im?</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: The prisoner was dying, sir. Tyler acted out
of a sense of mercy. I don’t believe Tyler to be dangerous, General. He
just needs…discipline. Two or three months outside will teach
him…discipline.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Sir. It’s quite clear that…</p>
<p><strong>gasparilla</strong>: Now I think Captain’s punishment is
fair, considerin’. In fact I think you ain’t got shit ta complain
about.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’m sorry, General, if I…spoke out of turn.
It’s just that…Mr Tyler is not here to defend himself. He has no
representation. I don’t believe due process is being served by…</p>
<p><strong>gasparilla</strong>: Listen, Missy. I am the only due process
that has ta be served aroun’ tyere and one of the people doin’ the
servin’ from now on is gonna be you. Now you been prancin’ aroun’ the
Cave like yer ass was glass fer long enough! All that’s</p>
<p><strong>gasparilla</strong>: gonna change, young lady. Now if you
still got a statement you’d like ta make, you can jus’ hold onto it ’til
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Tonight?</p>
<p><strong>gasparilla</strong>: That’s right. ‘Bout eight, if that
suits. We’ll start out in my gymnasium an’ progress on from there…to
various other forms o’ physical therapy.</p>
<p><strong>gasparilla</strong>: Oh, Lordy, Lordy…I’m drunk as a skunk.
Look at this…will ya jus’ loooooook at these lovelies! Say, Henried, you
ever try it with another woman?</p>
<p><strong>gasparilla</strong>: I’ve tried it with boys. Too
strenuous.</p>
<p><strong>gasparilla</strong>: Folks…I just couldn’t resist. How d’yall
like those? How do those taste?</p>
<p><strong>gasparilla</strong>: Fresh from the freezers, folks. It’s
what…THEY…EAT!</p>
<p><strong>gasparilla</strong>: Just kiddin’ folks. Just kiddin’. Would
I do a thing like that? I ask ya now, would I? Hah ha ha ha ha…</p>
<p><strong>gasparilla</strong>: The great state of Florida. People came
here fer years ta die. Retire and expire. The rest o’ the country used
ta think we was nothin’ but a bunch o’ farts and fogies. Hah! Now this
here’s the new Capital o’ the World! Hah! They came here…died…went to
hell…and the Devil sent ’em back as an army. Hah! General Gasparilla’s
army…MY ARMY!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: We think there are other cities surviving. We
think maybe Detroit… there’s some signalling out of Philly.</p>
<p><strong>gasparilla</strong>: There’s no place like this place. Warm
climate. This facility. Christ, there ain’t nothin’ like this
no-damn-where! Even the Feds knew that. That’s why they stored so much
o’ their shit down here. It’s all mine now. All mine. Just let ‘em try
ta come after us down here, which they will some day…take a likin’ ta
what all we got an’ come after us. They’ll hafta get past my army! An
army that ain’t afraid ta die…ha ha ha…’cause it’s awreddy DAID! HA HA
HA</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: It’s not a very big army. And small as it is
you won’t be able to continue feeding it for very long. We’ve got to
find ways of getting them to respond without relying on…</p>
<p><strong>gasparilla</strong>: You’ll find the ways, Miss Mary. And
when ya do…we’ll sail on over to the mainland…or any other damn mainland
fer that matter…and start us a recruitin’ program. There’s millions o’
Bees out there jus’ waitin’ fer’ a General ta lead ’em on ta
vict’ry!</p>
<p><strong>gasparilla</strong>: Well, hi there, y’all.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: We found two white Bees in the jungle with
their heads chopped open. I want to know who’s going outside the
compound. I want to know how they’re going out. I want to know why
they’re going out. Until I get these answers…each morning…some of you
will die.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Let me go! I’m the one he wants. This is all
happening because of me. If I turn myself in…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: He’s just finding another reason for bumpin’
us off. Don’t ya see. He needs us ta die. He needs our bodies.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: It’s alright. I’m a friend. I need help and so
do you. What’s a safe place to talk?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Ain’t no place safe.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Look…I know you have no reason to trust me.
I’ve got friends in the Cave. I got some stuff comin’ out this mornin’.
I’m gonna try to get off the island.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I’m gonna have this stuff sent over to the
hospital…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: The hospital?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Yeah. My stuff’s all marked with red crosses
so nobody gets too nosey. Meet me at the hospital after the supplies
come in. Maybe we can find a place there to talk.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Hey, Tricks. Some detail they got you on.</p>
<p><strong>tricks</strong>: Not as bad as yours, pal.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: What’dya get?</p>
<p><strong>tricks</strong>: Rafts. Two 38s. A little ammo.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: We need fuel, and a couple automatics.</p>
<p><strong>tricks</strong>: Hey, you. Those two on the bottom. Don’t
open those yet. They might be from the wrong shipment. Just keep ’em
around ’til I can check.</p>
<p><strong>lukey</strong>: Yessir. I never open ’em. Nossir. I keep ’em
innaback for you.</p>
<p><strong>diesel</strong>: He’s a spy. A spy for Rhodes.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Give him a chance.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What’dya tell that soldier, soldier? You tell
him we was rebels?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: He’s my contact for Chrissake! There’s two
crates. Can you get me into the hospital?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: There ya go. Complete with air
canisters…little motors.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: We got a boat.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I say we got a boat. Can you get other
stuff?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I got some fuel comin’ out and, I hope, some
automatic rifles.</p>
<p><strong>diesel</strong>: He’s just tryin’ to win us over. This
doesn’t prove anything.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m gonna trust him, Diesel. He already knows
who we are and we ain’t got a bunch o’ time to mess around with Rhodes
shootin’ up the joint every mornin’.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Can’t walk around here with these. Let’s just
leave ’em here ’til we ready ta use ’em.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: HANDS carefully…very carefully…pouring
DROPS OF CLEAR LIQUID INTO A TEST TUBE. The liquid is sweating slowly
out of A MILDEWED AND ROTTING STICK OF DYNAMITE which has been softened
to near-melting by jungle heat.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Take it away from me. Quickly. Take it! Take
it!</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Sorry. I’m sorry. I’ll, er…I’ll be alright…in
a moment.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You’re sick, Doc. You been sick for a while
now. Too sick to be workin’ with us on this raid.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You’ve helped us enough, providin’ cover,
hidin’ us out. Let the rest of us handle the physical stuff. It’s too
much for you.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: It’s my fight as much as yours. The things
they made me do…the things they made…me…do. I want so see Rhodes
destroyed. I want to see all of them, all of them destroyed. It’s my
duty…in the eyes of God. In the eyes of God.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: It won’t work. That’s pure nitro you’re
dealin’ with there. That stuff can blow if you look at is funny. What’re
you gonna do, walk into the Cave carryin’ those tubes on feather
pillows? You don’t have a complete layout of the place. Even if you
manage to avoid a fight you won’t know where to go.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: We’re hopin’ you can show us where ta go,
Toby.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Oh, no. I’m tryin’ to get off this island
alive. I’ll help you all I can but I’m not goin’ in there on a suicide
mission. What can you hope to accomplish? Some radios maybe? A supply
room or two? You’ll all be killed and in a few weeks they’ll be back to
business as usual. That place was built to withstand nuclear attack!
What are you gonna do with a half-dozen guns and a few sticks of
nitro?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: We’re gonna blow up the powder magazine.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: We know what’s down there. We did the loading’
and unloadin’ when the stuff came ashore in the early days. A direct hit
oughta do more than a few weeks worth o’ damage.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: A direct hit’ll blow the top off this whole
island! How’re you gonna fuse the stuff? How’re you gonna leave yourself
time to get out?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: If we don’t get out it’s a small price to
pay.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: You’re fuckin’ out of your minds! There’s two
hundred people down there. You gonna murder two hundred people?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Sinners! Animals! Filth! Doing the work of
the Devil!</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: What about the people here in the camp? If
they don’t get blown to kingdom come their food’ll be destroyed, their
water, medical supplies. They won’t have any more power. This island
can’t support them all, they’ll be doomed. Count me out, friends. I’m
gonna get my ass outa here. Anybody wants to come along is welcome.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I wanna see Rhodes burn just a much as you
do…but all those people. We don’t have the right to be their judges…
just like they don’t have the right to be our judges.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: We know what we must do. It’s written for us
in the Bible. “They shall be driven from the land of the living down to
the world of the dead. That is the fate of those who care nothing for
God.”</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Toby’s right. They’re not gonna sit around
with their fingers up their asses while we bust up their toys.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Datura.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Datura Metel. The Devil’s Trumpet. Don’t
worry. I ain’t goin’ religioso again. It’s a flower that grows on these
islands. Where I come from the voodoo priests used it whenever they
needed a Mickey Finn. It’s toxic. Ground up you can put it in a drink or
inject it…or…in a sealed area it might be introduced through the
ventilation system.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Datura! Miguel knew it! Datura, he was
shouting! Datura Metel!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: We always planned to use it. We got some
ground up already…but we could never find enough.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: There’s hundreds of ’em. Right where we
landed our boat.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: This stuff really works? No shit?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Quicker than gas. And it smells a lot
prettier. It usually don’t kill but it puts ya under fer a good night’s
sleep.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: If you could knock out the central
communications room you could foul up their whole intercom system. Then,
if you move fast enough, stay ahead of ‘em…without bein’ able to signal
each other, they might have a hard time catchin’ you.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I say it’s poetic. Pure calypso, brother. The
Devil’s Trumpet blowin’ the notes o’ doom for the Devil’s troops. Ha ha
ha ha ha…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Looks like just two. We can take ’em when the
time comes.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: We’re only about a quarter-mile from Cave
entrance number five.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: That entrance is closest to the labs and the
Bee cages.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Come on. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Just stand guard for now. Spell us after a
while. Can’t breathe this grass too long or somebody hafta carry you
home.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Maintenance shafts run behind all the main
rooms. Nobody’s in those at night. You can use them to get around in.
Hit the power governors first. Kick a surge into their computer network
and you erase everything stored in the memory. Then…over in here…that’s
where the cages are…</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: LUKEY, beside himself, almost to the point
of tears.</p>
<p><strong>lukey</strong>: I coulden stop ’em, boss. No way I coulda
stop ’em, I sweah. They tie me up and stick dis… …they stick dis in my
mouf. You b’lieve dis?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Jesus! They’re gonna try to do it! They’re
goin’ in! They got somebody to help ’em from the inside!</p>
<p><strong>lukey</strong>: They din’ get da pistols. You know dem
pistols you buddy send in widda raffs.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I gotta get Mary out. Tricks. We gotta go now!
Tonight! Right away!</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: We’re not ready.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Well…if ya think about it…we as ready as we
ever gonna be. How was they carryin’ the nitro, Lukey?</p>
<p><strong>lukey</strong>: Oh, me. You ain’t gonna b’lieve dis, neider.
You ain’t, I sweah. They put it inta Spidah’s body.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: They what?</p>
<p><strong>lukey</strong>: De Doc. He cut up Spidah here and here and
here…all ovah. He stick dem tubes in dere, like undah da skin…an’ den he
sews ’em all up. I sweah. I sweah, sweah, sweah!</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I know it hurts. But it won’t be long. Then
all the pain will be over. Oh, I wish you could hear me. GOD, GIVE HER
THE EARS TO</p>
<p><strong>diesel</strong>: Quiet!</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Oh, yes. Quiet. Yes. We must be quiet.</p>
<p><strong>thwok!!! the zombie’s steel hook sinks deeply into logan’s
upper</strong>: CHEST. The man’s eyes reflect no immediate sensation.
His speech falters but only slightly.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: …the pain of Hell…the pain…the pain…</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Okay. Lemme have ’em.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: A GRILL NEAR THE CEILING. BITS OF TOXIC
POLLEN and AN OCCASIONAL PIECE OF FLOWER blow into the room.</p>
<p><strong>radio man</strong>: What’s that? Smell it?</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: Dunno. Must be comin’ from outside.
Kinda nice.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Don’t move!</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Open the outer door. Move it!</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Hey! What the hell…..?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: What…what is this? Who…?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: It’s alright, it’s alright, my dear. You’ve
simply helped us do the Lord’s work.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: What…what have you done to her?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: God forgive us. Forgive us the pain we
inflict as surgeons. We’ll be in Heaven, child. Soon. We’ll be with Him
in Heaven.</p>
<p><strong>spider</strong>: Na…na…ak…aaaaaaaaaa…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Outa the way, Doc! Outa the way!</p>
<p><strong>red alarm button. the panel buzzes and coloured lights blink.
the</strong>: DOOR to the jungle starts to swing closed. DIESEL dives at
it but can’t stop the steel slab. It slams with A LOUD THUNNNNNG!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>diesel</strong>: Keep the woman covered.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: A BLINKING RECTANGLE OF RED LIGHT. Written
on its face is: ALARM - GATE 7. A BELL RINGS LOUDLY in the room. THE
SHOT WIDENS and we see FIVE MEN, all slumped, unconscious, none able to
react to the alarm.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Don’t be alarmed. We’re impregnable. Stay
where you are. Nothing will happen to any of you. You’re safe here.
Men.</p>
<p><strong>gasparilla</strong>: Well, c’mon, ladies and gents. Who says
we gotta let our evenin’ get spoiled? Simon sez…GET DOWN!!!</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: That’s the general alarm. Jesus! They musta
got in!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What you wanna do?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Come on!</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: What’s goin’ on?</p>
<p><strong>guard #2</strong>: I know him. That’s Tyler.</p>
<p><strong>the first guard hits a button and the big steel entrance door
swings</strong>: OPEN. THE REBELS storm in like an ocean wave taking the
hapless GUARDS completely by surprise. They knock them unconscious and
take their WEAPONS. TOBY pushes A BUTTON which causes the outer door to
swing shut, then he leads the band down the corridor.</p>
<p><strong>diesel</strong>: You’d hold us back. We have to go on.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Hmmmmmm? Oh, yes. Go on.</p>
<p><strong>diesel</strong>: Maps. Yes. She was supposed to bring us
maps.</p>
<p><strong>diesel</strong>: Alright. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Come on, Mary. Answer. ANSWER!</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Tricks, it’s Tyler. We’re inside.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: No. There’s some loonies from outside. They’re
gonna try to blow the powder magazine.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Find Mary. If you can get help do it. We’re
gonna hit the power station and haul-ass outa here. We’ll be at exit
five…that’s exit five in exactly ten minutes.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: And Mary! You gotta find Mary!</p>
<p><strong>montage</strong>: A LOUD BUZZING IS HEARD as DOORS OPEN
everywhere, some sliding, some swinging back, some rolling into the
walls. TROOPERS caught trotting through halls are taken by surprise.
CITIZENS spill out of apartment doors that have opened
electronically.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Those buttons won’t work! The evacuation
command overrides them.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: What is it? What’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: It’s an evacuation signal. The radios are out.
People are panicking.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: What should we do?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: God. I, er…I dunno what to say. It could be a
real evacuation or it could just be a glitch in the system. Wait here
for now. I’ll…I’ll make sure you get the word what to do, okay?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Please…hurry…</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: JULIE GRANT’S FACE, screaming, in agony,
on the brink of insanity. THE ZOMBIES have reached her. They’re started
to pull at her arms, her legs. ONE BITES HER HAND, ANOTHER HER ARM,
ANOTHER HER</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: We’ll be in Heaven soon. We’ll all be in
Heaven soon. Pain. God forgive the pain inflicted by surgeons. We must
atone. We must atone for our sins.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: We must…atone. We must.</p>
<p><strong>montage</strong>: as everywhere in the jungle ZOMBIES turn
toward the call of THE SIREN. They start to walk…toward the SOUND,
toward the place where there is food.</p>
<p><strong>the pistol, firing. the first shot rips open the creature’s
skull.</strong>: The next FIVE SHOTS are wasted, FIRED WILDLY. The GUN
CLICKS emptily as THE ZOMBIES engulf him, TEARING, BITING, EATING HIM
ALIVE.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Tricks! What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>tricks</strong>: Toby’s in the Cave. We’re gonna make our
move. There’s rebels out to blow the powder magazine. Come on. Come with
us.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Where are you goin’ out?</p>
<p><strong>tricks</strong>: Exit five.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: See ya there.</p>
<p><strong>trooper</strong>: Captain…CAPTAIN!</p>
<p><strong>open fire. the soldiers respond. two more soldiers go down.
one of</strong>: TRICKS’ MEN IS KILLED. TRICKS himself IS WOUNDED BADLY
IN THE</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Tricks…Jesus…</p>
<p><strong>tricks</strong>: I’m alright. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: The…the children, sir.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: After them then! I want them stopped! That
woman is dangerous!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: It’s alright. I don’t think they’ll hurt us.
Try to stay calm.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: They’re coming! They’re coming!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Look. It’s good to shoot the circles. Good.
Good.</p>
<p><strong>montage</strong>: as ALL OVER THE ROOM THEY STRIKE. This is
it, gore fans. The gross finale. The intestine-tugger. THE ZOMBIES GET
THEIR SUPPER. THEY FEAST AMONG THE PILLOWS, like Romans at an orgy.
MUSIC still plays over the gymnasium speakers, rock-a-billy in a gleeful
tempo.</p>
<p><strong>diesel fires point blank at the zombie, blowing its head to
bits.</strong>: MORE CREATURES are pressing in close. DIESEL bats at
one, kicks another, punches a third. Then he rushes to SPIDER’S side and
scoops her into his arms again. Wincing in pain from THE BLEEDING WOUND
IN HIS SHOULDER he manages to move out of immediate danger.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: It’s…he was…one who came to the island with
me.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Come on. No time.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: He was killed…five days ago.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Maybe…maybe he wasn’t dead. Are you sure he
was dead when you left him?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Look at him. A hundred bullets. You tell me.
Was he dead?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Five days…and he hasn’t…risen. He hasn’t
risen.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Come on. There’s no time. There’s no time to
lose.</p>
<p><strong>a sudden burst of automatic fire lights up the black foliage.
the</strong>: SOLDIERS react, flinging their WEAPONS over the side into
the water.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Damn you, island. Damn you ta Hell and
worse!</p>
<p><strong>blam! blam! blam! each one of the twelve bullets hits
rhodes</strong>: SOMEWHERE, many of them in the “kill-zones”. He screams
when the first few rounds hit, but his screaming stops about halfway
through the barrage. That’s when he dies. His leg bones support his
corpse long enough for the last six bullets to reach him. Then, as THE
SOUND OF BUB’S GUN ECHOES AWAY down the corridors, RHODES BODY slides
down the wall and crumples to the floor in a heap, leaving MUCH OF HIS
BLOOD on the ORANGE CIRCLE that’s mounted behind him.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: No. Don’t. Wait. Wait to see if… wait until
it’s necessary.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Me too…please.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Satan ain’t sent this man back. Not yet,
anyway. So we all hopin’ that maybe he’s up there with you, Lord. This
might be the first decent soul we been able ta offer ya in quite a few
years. That’s a fact. We just gonna… pray, Lord. We gonna pray that what
seems ta be happenin’ here…is really happenin’…and I’m gonna take the
chance and speak these words that I ain’t been able ta speak for so
long…</p>
<p><strong>the others</strong>: Amen.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Just me. I’ll take the next shift.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: How long do we have to watch him?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Forever, darlin’. Forever. ’Til he turns ta
dust and blows away on the wind.</p>
