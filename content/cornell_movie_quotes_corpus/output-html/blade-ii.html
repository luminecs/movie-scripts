<p><strong>employee</strong>: Have you recently visited a tropical
country? Uh-huh? In the past twelve months have you gotten a tattoo, non
sterile acupuncture, or undergone any ear, skin or body piercing?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Jared Nomak?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Hi. We’re ready for you now.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: I see from your questionnaire that you don’t
have any immediate next of kin?</p>
<p><strong>nomak</strong>: Not that I’m in contact with.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Nobody to call in case of an emergency?</p>
<p><strong>nomak</strong>: No – Does that mean I can’t be a donor?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: It depends. We came up with some unusual
results on your blood test.</p>
<p><strong>nomak</strong>: How unusual?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Your blood has a very rare phenotype, one
that’s quite valuable to people like us.</p>
<p><strong>nomak</strong>: Us? What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: It’s a good news-bad news scenario, Jared.
Good news for us, bad for you.</p>
<p><strong>nomak</strong>: Vampires –</p>
<p><strong>nomak</strong>: I fucking hate vampires.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Tell me where he his now and I’ll consider
you a loose end.</p>
<p><strong>vampire</strong>: Nobody’s th–</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Old man, old man, what’ve they done to you
–</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Why didn’t you finish me off?!?! I told
you –</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Come on, Whistler.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Let’s go home.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Scud!</p>
<p><strong>scud</strong>: Lock up your daughters, people –</p>
<p><strong>scud</strong>: The Dark Knight returns.</p>
<p><strong>scud</strong>: Little toke of the smokage, B?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Knock it off. We’ve got work to do.</p>
<p><strong>scud</strong>: Fuck me!</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: You going to stand there crapping your pants
or are you going to help me?!</p>
<p><strong>scud</strong>: You got something in mind, Blade?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Ultra-rapid detox. They use it on heroin
addicts, make ’em go cold-turkey in one night.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Gonna try and OD Whistler on a retroviral
cure.</p>
<p><strong>scud</strong>: I don’t know about this, man –</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Get back!!!</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: If there’s anything of you left in there,
Whistler, listen up now. Come morning, those shutters are going up.
Either you’ll be cured, or you’ll fry.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: It’s going to be a long night.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Daylight. Son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: How do you feel?</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Like a fucking heifer took a dump in my
mouth.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: You came back for me.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Did you think I wouldn’t?</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Took you long enough.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Let’s just hope you’ve kicked the Thirst for
good. I’ll be watching you close. You start to back-slide –</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: You put a bullet in my brain. Wouldn’t
expect anything else.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: I’ll say one thing for doing time as a
suckhead. Seems to have knocked that cancer of mine back into
remission.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Where the hell’s my lathe?</p>
<p><strong>tv</strong>: Here he comes, here comes Speed Racer! He’s a
demon on wheels. He’s gaining on you so you better look alive. He’s busy
revving up the powerful Mach Five –</p>
<p><strong>scud</strong>: Whistler. Cool beans. Nice to meet you, man.
Heard a lot. I’m Josh Frohmeyer. You can call me Scud, though. That’s
what most people do.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Tell me something, Skid –</p>
<p><strong>scud</strong>: Scud.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Whatever – What’d you do to the
Charger?</p>
<p><strong>scud</strong>: The pimp-mobile? Just made a few after market
modifications. Nitrous-oxide injection system, forged aluminum pistons
and crankshaft, higher flowing fuel pump.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Gave it a more aggressive exhaust profile
ramping.</p>
<p><strong>scud</strong>: Fuck yeah. Whole package’ll crank this betty
up another three-hundred horsepower.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: And you’ll burn the damn thing out before
your next fucking oil change.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Where’d you dig up this shit-bird
anyway?</p>
<p><strong>scud</strong>: Look, what’s your problem?</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: My problem, shitbird, is that I tried to
blow my fucking head off and wound up sucking blood clots for the last
year and a half! Now you’re standing there choking your chicken like
we’re all walking around some fucking candy-ass vampire sitcom!</p>
<p><strong>scud</strong>: Hey, you think I don’t know what’s at stake
here? We practically compromised our whole operation to save your
puckered old ass! And for what?</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Our operation?! Our operation?! I built
this operation, you fucking turd stain.</p>
<p><strong>scud</strong>: Motion sensors. Looks like Zone Three.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Human?</p>
<p><strong>scud</strong>: Body temp’s fifty so I’ll guess suck head.</p>
<p><strong>scud</strong>: I don’t understand, I’m not getting anything
on the surveillance cams.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: They’re fried. Whoever’s out there is
using magnesium flares. Seems like they’ve got your security system
stopped out pretty well.</p>
<p><strong>scud</strong>: Whoa, whoa, easy cowboy - I’m not trusting you
with a weapon just yet.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Hit the God-lights.</p>
<p><strong>second intruder</strong>: Stop!!!!!</p>
<p><strong>second intruder</strong>: We didn’t come here to fight. We
came to deliver a message.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Take off your masks.</p>
<p><strong>asad</strong>: My name is Asad. This is Nyssa. We represent
the Shadow Cabinet. The ruling body of Vampire nation. They’re offering
you a truce. They want to meet with you.</p>
<p><strong>scud</strong>: Bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: For decades you’ve been the thing we’ve
feared the most. But there’s something else loose on the streets now
–</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: Something worse than you.</p>
<p><strong>scud</strong>: This whole deal’s giving me a serious case of
the butt-willies.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Look, kid, they obviously found your base
of operations. If it was a trap, why flip their dicks by announcing
themselves?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: I agree. We play along for now, we might wind
up learning something about how their world ticks.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Either that or feeding the worms.</p>
<p><strong>asad</strong>: They’re ready to see you now.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: They tell bedtime stories about you. Blade
the big, bad boogie-man. Frankly, I’m disappointed. That you were
willing to come along so easily, I mean. Without any assurances.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Semtex explosive. Enough to level a city
block. How’s that for assurance?</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: The House of Erebus you encountered before
were nothing but feudal lords. The true power of the Vampire Nation lies
here –</p>
<p><strong>asad</strong>: Few warmbloods have seen what’s beyond this
door.</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: Father –</p>
<p><strong>damaskinos</strong>: I hope you don’t mind the cold. When one
such as myself reaches an advanced age, certain precautions are needed
in order to preserve the flesh.</p>
<p><strong>asad</strong>: Blade, this is Overlord Eli Damaskinos.</p>
<p><strong>damaskinos</strong>: Welcome, Daywalker. I thank you for
coming. I’ve been anxious to meet you for quite some time.</p>
<p><strong>damaskinos</strong>: And the late Abraham Whistler. I trust
your time amongst our numbers was agreeable?</p>
<p><strong>damaskinos</strong>: It has been said, you may have enemies
whom you hate, but not enemies whom you despise. Be proud of your enemy:
then his success shall be yours, too. In that regard, I should thank
you.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: Eliminating Deacon Frost.</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: All that unseemly business with LaMagra.
You did us a favor. Carter Stevens.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: You’re human.</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: Barely. I’m a lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>asad</strong>: Mr. Stevens works with the National Institute
of Health. Given that they monitor the nation’s blood supply, a
strategic alliance seemed prudent.</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: We also finance a number of humanitarian
organizations – the National Institute of Infectious Diseases for one,
the Human Genome Project…</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: Survival.</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: As you may know, Vampirism is an arbovirus,
one that’s spread through the saliva of parasitic organisms – In this
case, vampires are the vector. The virus replicates within the human
bloodstream, evolving its host into an entirely new life-form.
Unfortunately, viruses evolve too –</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: We’ve dubbed this new virus the Reaper
Strain. And like any good pathogen, it appears to have found a carrier –
a “Patient Zero”.</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: His name is Jared Nomak.</p>
<p><strong>damaskinos</strong>: Thiavolos, as we used to say in Greece.
The Devil. Pure Thirst. Nothing more. He was born a vampire, but he is
an anomaly. Like you. Unlike the rest of us, however, he feeds on not
just humans, but vampires as well.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Seems like he’s doing me a favor, then.</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: You’re missing the point. Their vampire
victims don’t die. They turn. They become carriers. If the Reapers
continue unchecked, there could be thousands of them before the month is
over. Do the math.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: You want me to hunt them for you.</p>
<p><strong>damaskinos</strong>: Not alone.</p>
<p><strong>asad</strong>: We’ve been training a small tactical unit –
the Bloodpack. We want you to lead them.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Just how long has this little social club
of yours been together?</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: Two years.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Then they weren’t created to go after your
“patient zero”.</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: No. They’ve been training to hunt you.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Sounds like a plan.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: What do you really think?</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: These guys are shitting bricks cause
they’re no longer on the top of the food chain. They’re going to fuck us
the first chance they get.</p>
<p><strong>scud</strong>: So you’re going to do this?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Keep your friends close and your enemies
closer. Isn’t that how the saying goes?</p>
<p><strong>scud</strong>: I’m worried about him. Look, I know he’s your
friend, but just watch him, okay? Nobody goes cold Turkey from the
Thirst in a night.</p>
<p><strong>scud</strong>: Um, we’ve got company.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Well if it isn’t Snow White and the Seven
Suckheads.</p>
<p>****: Verlaine looks familiar because she is the twin sister of
Raquel, the bodacious vamp played by Traci Lords that</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: Check it out, troops. Count Chocula.</p>
<p><strong>asad</strong>: Blade, this is Reinhardt. That’s Snowman,
Lighthammer, Priest, Chupa and Verlaine.</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: Tell me something, Chief. Can you
blush?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Alright, you want to play this game?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: You’ve been training two years to take me
out. Here I am, the big, bad vampire hunter. So do it.</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: What the hell are you doing, Blade?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: We’re going to be working as a unit, you
people will be taking orders from me. So let’s get it over with. I’ll
give you a free shot, Reinhardt.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Why are you looking at her for? You need
permission? I’m giving it to you.</p>
<p><strong>chupa</strong>: Take him, cabron!</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: What’s wrong, Reinhardt? You need a fucking
manual?</p>
<p><strong>verlaine</strong>: Do it, Reinhardt. Do it!!!</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Listen up, Adolph, I just popped an explosive
charge in the back of your head. Silver nitrate. Rigged to blow if
anyone tampers with it. I’ll be keeping the detonator on me at all
times. You so much as look at me crosswise and I swear you’ll be macking
your girlfriend’s pie with a fucking neck stump! Got it?!</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Any questions?</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Glaser safety rounds in .38, .45, and 9mm
caliber. Foil capsules at the tip filled with silver nitrate grains.
They pack a major kinetic energy dump. And since you suckheads don’t
like sunlight, we’ve modified the entry lights with UV filters –</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: This puppy here? Hyper-velocity railgun.
Spits up silver-tipped iron core needles at six thousand butt humping
feet per second. Like this –</p>
<p><strong>chupa</strong>: Hey, hey! The fuck you doing?!</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Getting your attention, Paco.</p>
<p><strong>chupa</strong>: Well you’ve got it, warmblood. Now what the
fuck are you gonna do with it?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: If you girls are finished flirting, I’d like
to get started.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Didn’t I kill you already?</p>
<p><strong>verlaine</strong>: That was my sister.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: This the part where you beat your chest and
vow revenge?</p>
<p><strong>verlaine</strong>: Something like that.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Save it for the director’s cut.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Where to first?</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: The House of Pain.</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: From what we can gather, the Reapers hunt in
packs, targeting places where vampires congregate. So far, they’ve
attacked bloodbanks, safehouses, underground clubs like this –</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: I don’t see any traffic, no vampire glyphs
–</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: Look closer. Because of your efforts, we’ve
had to re-think our habits, tighten our security.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Let’s put this clusterfuck in gear.</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: You’re not going anywhere, greenjeans.
You won’t be able to pass for us.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Like I give a shit.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: He’s right. They’ll smell that you’re human.
Stay here, watch our backs.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: I don’t like it.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: I’m not giving you a choice, old man.</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: You don’t keep that dog of yours curbed,
Blade. We might have to do it for you.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Keep pushing, asshole.</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: This is our world you’re entering. You may
see things – feeding. Just remember why you’re here.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: I haven’t forgotten.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: So what are we looking for, exactly?</p>
<p><strong>asad</strong>: Anyone who looks suspicious.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: You gotta be kidding me.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: What is it with you people and pain?</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: We need it. Sensations are addictive and pain
cuts the deepest. Tattoos, piercings, tribal scarring – because we
regenerate, none of it’s permanent. So we have to take it to the next
level. To remind us we’re alive.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: You reading me, Scud?</p>
<p><strong>scud</strong>: Loud and clear, B.</p>
<p><strong>scud</strong>: Everything’s copacetic in the Mystery Van. How
you doing, Whistler?</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Walking on sunshine, toke-boy.</p>
<p><strong>corpulent vampire</strong>: Close the fucking door,
buddy.</p>
<p><strong>corpulent vampire</strong>: I said, close the f–</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>scud</strong>: Um, Whistler, you out there?</p>
<p><strong>scud</strong>: Whistler?</p>
<p><strong>scud</strong>: They’re here!!!!</p>
<p><strong>lighthammer</strong>: Ohmygodhe’sfuckingkillingmehe’s –</p>
<p><strong>scud</strong>: UV headlights, c’mon, come on!!!</p>
<p><strong>scud</strong>: FuckmefuckmefuckmeFUCKME!!!!</p>
<p><strong>scud</strong>: Use your entry lights! They can’t stand the
UV!!!</p>
<p><strong>asad</strong>: Use your entry lights!</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Whistler! He’s heading across the roof! Take
him!</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Whistler!!!</p>
<p><strong>nomak</strong>: Is the enemy of my enemy my friend or my
enemy? What do you think, Blade? What am I to you?</p>
<p><strong>nomak</strong>: Athelfiki singenia ex amato.</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: You’re hurt.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: I’ll heal.</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: What about Nomak?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: He escaped. You didn’t tell me they were
immune to silver and garlic.</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: I didn’t know.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: We lose anybody?</p>
<p><strong>nomak</strong>: Lighthammer and –</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Oh god, oh God it hurts! It hurts, it hurts,
fuck, it hurts. Ugh!</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: how long since he was bitten?</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: Minutes.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: It’s already changing him –</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: Jesus, can’t you get him to shut the fuck
up!?</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: His blood cells aren’t producing oxygen
anymore. His own body is suffocating him. These things are like crack
addicts. If they don’t feed every few hours, they’ll feed on
themselves.</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: Somebody put him out of his misery for
fuck’s sake!</p>
<p><strong>verlaine</strong>: You kill him! I’m not killing him!</p>
<p><strong>chupa</strong>: Mierda!!</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: If this is the best you turd-stains have
to offer, I’m not impressed.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: I thought you were supposed to be watching
our backs.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Ran into a little Reaper trouble
myself.</p>
<p><strong>chupa</strong>: Oh yeah? Like how little? In case you hadn’t
noticed, we lost two men while you were out farting around.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: You need to ratchet those ’nads of yours
down a few notches, paco.</p>
<p><strong>chupa</strong>: Listen, hillbilly, you are a cunt-hair away
from cowboy heaven.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Ain’t no thing but a chicken wing,
buttercup.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Where were you, Whistler?</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: I’ll show you.</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: What the hell?</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: I found him like this. I think he was
trying to crawl back into that culvert.</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: Everything okay?</p>
<p><strong>damaskinos</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: They’ve made contact with the Reapers.</p>
<p><strong>damaskinos</strong>: Any casualties?</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: Two so far.</p>
<p><strong>damaskinos</strong>: An inevitability, I suppose. Nyssa was
not among them, I trust.</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: No. This is a dangerous game, you’re
playing, Damaskinos.</p>
<p><strong>damaskinos</strong>: Any game worthy of being played is. One
must be patient. In this way, I have outlived my enemies. All of
them.</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: Blade’s too volatile. You’re not going to
be able to keep manipulating him –</p>
<p><strong>damaskinos</strong>: You worry too much, Stevens. I have
assurance from our friend inside that events are unfolding as
scripted.</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: As scripted? You’ve already lost two of
your own. How many more are you willing to sacrifice?</p>
<p><strong>damaskinos</strong>: As many as it takes. Do you see that jar
over there?</p>
<p><strong>damaskinos</strong>: It contains my human heart – Something I
relinquished a long time ago. Only a fool would appeal to it now.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Recognize him?</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: From the surveillance footage in the
bloodbank. He was one of the guard’s Nomak attacked.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Which means he turned about seventy-two hours
ago.</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: Right. So why is he dying? He doesn’t appear
to have any broken bones, no entry wounds of any kind – what’s killing
him?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Time.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: No hemoglobin left. Their metabolisms are too
fast. They burn out. That’s why they’re having to feed so often. Their
systems are self destructing.</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: If that’s true, what about Nomak? He’s been
alive longer than the others.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Nomak’s different. He’s the carrier. There’s
something driving him beyond the Thirst. Something we’re missing.</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: They appear to have a nictating membrane
here, like you’d see on a crocodile or camel. Shields the eyes from
sunlight.</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: A bifurcated mandible. More developed
masseter muscles and zygomatic bones around the mouth allowing for a
much larger, stronger bite –</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: Epidermal layers are thicker, tougher –</p>
<p><strong>scud</strong>: Ho-lee shit.</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: I’ve never seen anything like this. The
Reapers are as different from us as we are from you. It’s almost as if
the virus is re-wiring their bodies, creating new, parasitic organs
which consume the old ones.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Like cancer with a purpose.</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: Exactly. Look at the digestive system. It’s
been drastically simplified. Super charged. And this –</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: The heart is completely encased in bone.</p>
<p><strong>scud</strong>: Good luck getting a stake through that.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: We’ve got six hours till sunrise. Be ready by
then.</p>
<p><strong>asad</strong>: What happens at sunrise?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: We take up the hunt again.</p>
<p><strong>chupa</strong>: You gotta be fucking joking.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: You’ve seen what we’re up against. Daylight’s
the only advantage we’ve got. They’ll be more vulnerable then.</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: And so will we.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Look, I care about the humans who are dying,
not you, got it?</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: Spare me the race card, OJ. We’re not
going out into the sun. It’s too risky.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: You don’t have a choice. You’re just going to
have to protect yourselves as best you can.</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: You buying any of this chocolate Elvis
bullshit?</p>
<p><strong>chupa</strong>: This guy doesn’t know what the fuck he’s
doing. We already lost Priest and Lighthammer, who’s gonna be next? Fuck
him. Fuck his rules. First chance I get, I’m chowing down on that
fucking HeeHaw sidekick of his.</p>
<p><strong>verlaine</strong>: What do you think, Asad?</p>
<p><strong>asad</strong>: I don’t think. I follow orders.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: You ask me, you and Miss Muffet are
getting a mite too cozy for my taste.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: I wouldn’t worry about it.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: I am worrying. Seems to me, you’re
starting to get confused as to which side of the line you’re standing
on.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Pretty hollow words coming from a man who
spent the last year running with the enemy.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: What the hell is that supposed to
mean?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: It means I’m starting to wonder if the
vampires still have their hooks in you. You’ve been acting strange ever
since I gave you the cure. Reckless, quick to anger – You said it
yourself, Whistler. Those vampires knew our defense system backwards and
forwards. Where’d they get their intel?</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: I’m compromised?! Me?! I’m not the one
playing stink-finger with Vampirella out there!</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: You’re out of line, old man.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: We’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>dealer</strong>: Lookin’ to get hooked up?</p>
<p><strong>chupa</strong>: What you got?</p>
<p><strong>dealer</strong>: Horse, Hawaiian ice. Whatever you want.</p>
<p><strong>chupa</strong>: Whatever, huh? Well I’m all off the hook on
that bitch.</p>
<p><strong>dealer</strong>: So what’s it gonna be?</p>
<p><strong>chupa</strong>: Fear.</p>
<p><strong>chupa</strong>: I like a little adrenaline chaser.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: What do you think you’re doing?</p>
<p><strong>chupa</strong>: Trying to feed, puto baboso!</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: Do it and you die. You heard Asad. Until this
is over, these people are our allies.</p>
<p><strong>chupa</strong>: Oh I haven’t forgotten about Asad. I’m just
wondering if you have.</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: He’s right about one thing. We do have to
survive.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: You don’t have to hunt to do it.</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: Really? What are we supposed to do, then?
Starve ourselves because we fee on others in order to live? What about
that scumbag you just let off the hook? A nothing. A drug-dealer. How do
you justify saving people like that?</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: You know the Thirst better than any of us.
You’re barely managing to tread water yourself. Living in a constant
state of pain, having to shoot up that serum of yours. That’s not what I
call surviving, Blade.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: The hell are you fiddling with there?</p>
<p><strong>scud</strong>: Tweaked the phosphor rod, modified the
collimated beam, wanna concentrate the light, get something like a UV
laser going.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: You’re wasting your time, already been
tried.</p>
<p><strong>scud</strong>: Yeah, but you didn’t have the Scudster working
on it, did you?</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Nope. Back then we did not.</p>
<p><strong>scud</strong>: So how long have you known Blade, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Going on twenty years now.</p>
<p><strong>scud</strong>: Blade doesn’t talk about the old days
much.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Blade doesn’t talk about anything much.
What about you, though?</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Pretty.</p>
<p><strong>scud</strong>: I was backpacking. Hooked up with these two
chicks who were off to see the Burning Man festival. We were gonna take
“E”, have ourselves a little freeball out in the desert. You know the
riff, “Dear Penthouse, I never thought this would happen to me, but
–”</p>
<p><strong>scud</strong>: Anyway, halfway through our Three’s Company
marathon, Janet and Chrissy started taking chunks out of me. Woulda died
too if Blade hadn’t shown up and staked those mamacitas a new honeyhole.
Things kinda fell in place after that.</p>
<p><strong>scud</strong>: Took myself a few souvenirs, though.</p>
<p><strong>scud</strong>: Mmm-mmm. Poppa’s got a brand new bag.</p>
<p><strong>scud</strong>: The powerpacks have a limited charge, maybe
ten minutes of continuous use at most.</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: What are these?</p>
<p><strong>scud</strong>: UV flashbang grenades with plug-in phosphor
sticks – This is for the grand finale. Wired together a couple-dozen of
those puppies. But I’d be careful where you pop your load. Might end up
frying yourselves in the process.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: What about you? You’re not coming?</p>
<p><strong>scud</strong>: After last night? Dude, I’m a lover, not a
fighter.</p>
<p><strong>asad</strong>: What good is all this firepower if we don’t
know where they’re hiding?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: We won’t need to. They’ll come to us.</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: This is fucking foul!</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: They’re pheromones. I infused them from that
Reaper’s adrenal glands. All mammals use them to mark their territory.
Even vampires.</p>
<p><strong>chupa</strong>: Fuck that! I’m not spraying some gash hound’s
nut-juice on me!</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: Trust me, the Reapers will key to it. If we
use this, we’ll draw them out.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Time for Nyssa’s pheromones.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Eau de suckhead. Tasty.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: We’ll split into three units. First team that
makes contact wins the prize. Try to maintain radio silence from here on
out.</p>
<p><strong>chupa</strong>: Turn it off.</p>
<p><strong>chupa</strong>: We want to attract them, not scare them
off.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Yeah, but you fangs can see in the dark.
What am I supposed to do?</p>
<p><strong>chupa</strong>: Bifocals, grandpa. And try to keep up.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Must be hundreds of these skeletons here.</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: So I think you people may have underestimated
how many Reapers you’re dealing with.</p>
<p><strong>chupa</strong>: Hey,hillbilly.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: What the fuck you doing?</p>
<p><strong>chupa</strong>: Ain’t nobody here but you and me, chicken
wing. I’d say this is as good a time as any to settle up.</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: Blade. We’ve got six Reapers. They’re all
dead.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Fry ’em.</p>
<p><strong>asad</strong>: What? Where did they go?</p>
<p><strong>verlaine</strong>: Screw that, where did Snowman go?</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: Jesus, they were playing possum!</p>
<p><strong>nomak</strong>: Whistler.</p>
<p><strong>nomak</strong>: If you survive this, tell your master. My end
is my beginning.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Take mine!</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Reinhardt!</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Re-group! Re-group!</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: Where’s Chupa?</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Forget him, he’s chunk-style.</p>
<p><strong>asad</strong>: Same with Snowman and Verlaine.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Guess that perfume of yours did the trick
after all?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: A little too well, I’d say.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Perfect. We got the whole fucking
Partridge family here.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Unless anybody has any bright ideas, I’d
say we’re about half a battery away from a reaper gang-bang.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Give me the rest of the pheromones.</p>
<p><strong>asad</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Verlaine’s body is back there somewhere with
the UV bomb. If you train your guns in that direction, you’ll drive an
opening in their ranks. I’ll run for it. When the Reapers come after me,
you make a break for it the other way.</p>
<p><strong>asad</strong>: You won’t make it.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Then I’ll die trying, won’t I?</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: Blade.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Save it. I don’t want to hear your words.
Let’s do this NOW!!!</p>
<p><strong>er nurse</strong>: Sir, you can’t just –</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: She needs a hypertransfusion. NOW!</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: God in Heaven.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Alright, buddy, step away if –</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Do you want to die?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Not particularly.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Then get your fucking team in gear.</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: Each day is a little life.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: “Each day is a little life. Every waking and
rising a little birth, every fresh morning a little youth, every going
to rest and sleep a little death.”</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: Anyone else make it?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: It would’ve been easy for you to let me die
back there today, but you didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: I wouldn’t read too much into it.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: You don’t want to go there.</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Because one of us is going to kill the other
before this ends.</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: It doesn’t have to be like that. We don’t
have to be enemies.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Get real. I was useful to Damaskinos as long
as the hunt was still on. Now that it’s over, all bets are off.</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: If that’s true, then why’d you save me?</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: Why do you hate us so much?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: I am a hunter. A weapon. It’s what I do. It’s
in my blood.</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: Well it’s in mine, too. I’m a pureblood. I
wasn’t turned. I was born this way. Just like you. Am I evil because I
want to survive? What about a wolf? What about any predator?</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: The only difference between you and me is
that I made peace with who I was a long time ago. I’m not ashamed of
what I am. You haven’t been hunting us all these years. You’ve been
hunting yourself.</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: You’re hurting me.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Pain cuts the deepest, isn’t that what you
said?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Reminds you you’re alive?</p>
<p><strong>scud</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: He was here. Watching us.</p>
<p><strong>scud</strong>: Nomak?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: He wants us to know he’s hunting us now.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Nomak said something to me before he
disappeared the first time –</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Athelfiki singenia ex amato. At first I
thought he might’ve been using one of the vampire dialects. But it turns
out, it’s Greek. Do you know what it means?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: It means “bloodbrother.”</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Well maybe I do.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Your security’s for shit, kid.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Where the hell have you been?</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Just out connecting a few dots.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Bangin’ some vampire chick. Kind of a faux
pas in our line of work, wouldn’t you say? Hope you double bagged it, at
least.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: What’s your problem, Whistler?</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Why don’t you ask your girlfriend?</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: I did some checking on that Carter Stevens
character. That familiar of theirs who claimed he was with the NIH?
Turns out he used to work for them, but he doesn’t anymore.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Then who does he work for?</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Some biotech outfit called Caliban
Industries. They’ve been lying to us since day one. This Nomak fucker
didn’t evolve. He was designed.</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: I don’t know what he’s talking about.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: You expect us to believe that? Who you
going to trust, Blade? Me or her?</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: You?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Start talking, bitch.</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: I don’t know what you –</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Nomak! You created him!</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: Ohgodohgodohgod… Alright, alright. Yes, we
did…</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Keep talking, Stevens. Tell me why.</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: The Shadow Cabinet. For decades they’ve
been trying to find a way to rid themselves of their hereditary
weaknesses. Viral epidemiology, immunochemistry. Recombinant DNA was the
next logical step.</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: No, that’s not possible. They wouldn’t keep
something like this from me…</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: Your father didn’t want you to know.
Something went wrong. The Reaper strain was too aggressive. Then Nomak
escaped.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: And we’re supposed to clean up your mess.
Fucking perfect.</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: Look, the fact that Nomak was artificially
created didn’t make the threat any less urgent. He was still out there,
spreading the Reaper virus.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: The genetic material you spliced into Nomak –
Where did you get it?</p>
<p><strong>damaskinos</strong>: I should think that would be obvious at
this point.</p>
<p><strong>damaskinos</strong>: We took the genetic material from
you.</p>
<p><strong>damaskinos</strong>: Jared Nomak is your genetic brother. And
I suppose if you follow that line of reasoning to its logical
conclusion, then these are your offspring.</p>
<p><strong>damaskinos</strong>: A new breed, begotten from your own
flesh. Immune to silver, even sunlight. The wolves have lain with the
sheep long enough. No more compromises. No more deals. Only closure.</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: Put it back in park, Blade.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Thought you were dead.</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: Seems like there’s a lot of that going
around these days.</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: Six-thousand feet per second, isn’t that
what Whistler said? Let’s see you dodge this one –</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: Blade!</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Kiss your ass goodbye, Reinhardt.</p>
<p><strong>scud</strong>: You’re wasting your time, Blade. The
flechette’s a dud.</p>
<p><strong>scud</strong>: It was never supposed to explode. All it was
supposed to do was make you feel like you were in control.</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: Thought you had me on a short leash,
didn’t you, chief? Only it turns out, you’re the one that’s been on the
leash.</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: That’s better.</p>
<p><strong>scud</strong>: See, I’m one of Damaskinos’ familiars.</p>
<p><strong>scud</strong>: Yeah, your little cootchie knew.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: You little shit. When did they get to
you?</p>
<p><strong>scud</strong>: Back when Blade had me hunting down your
puckered old ass. What’s up with your hair, anyway? Fucking Willie
Nelson look-a-like?</p>
<p><strong>scud</strong>: Man, I so wanted to do that.</p>
<p><strong>scud</strong>: And you. You never cared about me. I gave you
everything. All you cared about was digging up the old fuck! You think
they scoped out my security system? I let them in. Dude, I practically
gave ’em the fucking keys. I’ve been feeding Damaskinos information the
whole time. Providing them with samples of your genetic material –
helping them with the Reaper program. They’re close, Blade. Right up
against it. Any day now, they’re all going to be Daywalkers. And when
that happens, well, let’s just say, I don’t want to be on the losing
team. You may be strong, you may be fast, but in the end, you’re just
too human, B.</p>
<p><strong>scud</strong>: So that’s down and dirty. Got anything to say
for yourself?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Two things. One, I was on to you the moment
they turned you. And two – I switched that dud of yours back with the
real one.</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: Son of a bitch!</p>
<p><strong>damaskinos</strong>: Reinhardt!</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: What about him, then? Me and Hobo Kelly
here have a little unfinished business.</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: Nice.</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: How many vampires do you think he’s
killed with this thing?</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Not nearly enough, Fritz.</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: Keep talking, warmblood.</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: When I’m through with you, you’ll be
begging for a dirt nap.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Been dead before. Didn’t much cotton to
it. Tell you what, chicken shit. You do your worst. We’ll settle up
after.</p>
<p><strong>damaskinos</strong>: My child –</p>
<p><strong>damaskinos</strong>: I would hate to think you were losing
your perspective. Who do you think God favors in the web? The spider or
the fly?</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: Nomak said something to Blade in Greek.
Athelfiki singenia ex amato. Where did he learn that?</p>
<p><strong>damaskinos</strong>: From his father, of course.</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: You experimented on your own, son?</p>
<p><strong>damaskinos</strong>: I have fathered thousands of children in
centuries since I first walked this earth. Make no mistake, Nyssa. Those
blood-ties mean nothing to me when measured against the ascendancy of
our race. Nothing. If you have any interest in remaining alive, you
would do well to remember that.</p>
<p><strong>damaskinos</strong>: With every century, humans become more
repulsive to me. Once, you were souls to be taken, corrupted. But you
have disgraced yourselves to being nothing more than blood and meat.</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: We’re going to harvest you, Blade. Bone
marrow, organs, everything. Your tissue’s too valuable to let go to
waste.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Nomak is still out there.</p>
<p><strong>damaskinos</strong>: True, but thanks to you, we know his
weakness. We can keep him contained. It’s just a matter of time before
we hunt him down.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Too bad you’re out of it.</p>
<p><strong>damaskinos</strong>: And why is that?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Revenge. That’s what Nomak wanted all along.
To pay back the people who created him.</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: You may be right. Fortunately for us, he
has no idea where this facility is located.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: He does now. He’s been watching me since the
tunnels. Following me. I led him right to you.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Just like a trail of bread crumbs.</p>
<p><strong>damaskinos</strong>: Stop him!</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>damaskinos</strong>: Get out of the way.</p>
<p><strong>whistler</strong>: Come on, Blade. Talk to me!</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Blood…</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: What are you doing?!!</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: Stop him!!!</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Tell me something, chief. Can you blush?</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: I overrode the security codes.</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: We’re locked in.</p>
<p><strong>damaskinos</strong>: Are you insane? He’ll kill us both!</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: Maybe it’s better that way.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: What’s it going to be, Damaskinos? Thiavolos.
The devil you know –</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: – or the devil you don’t?</p>
<p><strong>damaskinos</strong>: For God’s sake, Nyssa! Let us out of
here!</p>
<p><strong>nomak</strong>: Why are you frightened, father? The prodigal
son has returned.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Get out of here!</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Nyssa!!!</p>
<p><strong>nomak</strong>: Blood brother.</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: How does it look?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: Not good.</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: It won’t be long now. I can already feel it
burning inside me –</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: I don’t want to become what Nomak was – I
can’t. I want to die while I’m still vampire.</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: What do you want me to do?</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: I want to see the sun rise.</p>
<p><strong>nyssa</strong>: Each day is a little life. Remember?</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: I am a hunter. A weapon. It’s what I do. It’s
in my blood…</p>
<p><strong>rush</strong>: – yelling for your tender touch, you can never
get enough –</p>
<p><strong>rush</strong>: – cover me with your love –</p>
<p><strong>rush</strong>: Voulez-vous coucher avec moi, ce soir!
Voulez-vous coucher AVEC MOI!!!</p>
<p><strong>blade</strong>: What? You think I forgot about you?</p>
