<p><strong>moderator</strong>: Tonight we’ll discuss a subject most of
us seem to consider either bad taste or frivolous or funny. But if our
experts are right, we face what might be called a masculinity crisis.
Every fourth American man uptight, threatened by the increasing sexual
demands of American women…</p>
<p><strong>irate woman</strong>: They always put it that way, but well,
all it means, you know, is every fourth American woman’s never
satisfied. That’s it. I never am – have been, you know…</p>
<p><strong>cool woman</strong>: This, this image of the, the man eating
woman. It isn’t our increasing demands. I think it’s the shrinking
American male…</p>
<p><strong>sad woman</strong>: No, I never had, well, whatever it is you
call it. But the hours he works, I can’t blame him…</p>
<p><strong>sad woman’s voice</strong>: … but it’s a problem. A big
problem. With so many women I know…</p>
<p><strong>job</strong>: Just keep your pants on, ladies…</p>
<p><strong>lady commentator</strong>: Before World War One – American
men outnumbered women by over six percent. Today American women not only
outnumber men, but live five years longer – leaving them in control of
vast corporate wealth and seventy-five percent of America’s purchasing
power…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Y’all,line up and take your turn…</p>
<p><strong>moderator</strong>: My question is this – will American
know-how come up with a marketable male to replace all the men who are
worrying themselves into an early grave over women’s increasing sexual
demands?</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Where’s that Joe Buck?</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: Where’s that Joe Buck?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Yeah, where’s that Joe Buck?</p>
<p><strong>sally buck</strong>: You look real nice, Joe baby…</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Where’s that Joe Buck?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Yeah, where’s that Joe Buck?</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: You’re due here at four o’clock. Look at
those dishes, look!</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Know what you can do with those dishes? And if
you ain’t man enough to do it yourself, I’d be happy to oblige…</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Four to midnight, understand?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Say, look, uh, I gotta have a word with you, if
you got a second.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Later. Later maybe.</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: You ain’t coming to work?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Don’t guess. Just come for my day’s pay owing
and to tell you I’m heading East.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Cups!</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: What you gonna do back there, East?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Lotta rich women back there…</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Men, they mostly faggots.</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: Must be some mess back there.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Well, ain’t no use hanging around here.</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: Ain’t gonna collect your pay?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I got me two hundred twenty-four bucks of flat
folding money… He know what he can do with that chicken-shit day’s pay.
And if he ain’t man enough to do it for himself, I be happy to
oblige!</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Tough tiddy, ladies, you had your chance.</p>
<p><strong>announcer’s voice</strong>: Benson and Hedges One Hundreds
makes special awards from time to time for anything that’s longer than
anything…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Care to get out your yardstick, gentlemen?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: This is a powerful mothah, ain’t it?</p>
<p><strong>pale blonde</strong>: Do you have a stick of gum?</p>
<p><strong>pale blonde</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Plenty more where that came from.</p>
<p><strong>pale blonde</strong>: Thank you, no, it’s just till the
Dramamine works. I get carsick.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I only get carsick on boats. But seems to me
that’s more the fish smell than the bouncing…</p>
<p><strong>sally buck</strong>: No, a little lower, sugar, yeah, yeah,
that’s good. Grammaw’s beat.</p>
<p><strong>salesman’s voice</strong>: You gotta sell yourself, that’s
the whole trick…</p>
<p><strong>salesman</strong>: It ain’t the product and it ain’t the
price, no sir, and it ain’t what you sell, it’s personality, pure and
simple. I ain’t shined my own shoes or shaved my own face in forty
years, how’s that? Not bad for a kid that didn’t pass the eighth grade,
right?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Yeah, hell, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>salesman</strong>: And that’s my golden rule. Make ’em love
you. Put yourself over and you can sell them anything. If they like you,
they’ll buy horsemeat for prime beef…</p>
<p><strong>sally buck</strong>: You get him to the church, honey. He
ain’t gonna find out you ain’t a real blonde till after you’re married,
then’s too late.</p>
<p><strong>sally buck</strong>: You getting too big for your britches,
sugar.</p>
<p><strong>sally buck’s voice</strong>: Don’t forget to say your
prayers, honey…</p>
<p><strong>old lady</strong>: I want it on.</p>
<p><strong>evangelist’s voice</strong>: Oh, my friends, I say unto you,
invest with Jesus, put your dollars to work where they’ll pay off at
compound interest. The Good Book says money answereth all things…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Light?</p>
<p><strong>evangelist’s voice</strong>: … everyone who sends a dollar to
the Evangelical Congregation of the Air will get free gratis a genuine
leatherette hymn book so you can sing along with Sister Rosella and the
Evangelical Choir…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: You throw in Sister Rosella and you got a deal,
right, old timer?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Going far?</p>
<p><strong>old cowhand</strong>: Up the line. Not far.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I’m bound for New York City.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Ever happen to come across a cowman name of
Woodsy Niles? Friend of my grammaw Sally Buck…</p>
<p><strong>sally buck</strong>: Like it, honey? Does it fit?</p>
<p><strong>woodsy</strong>: You do me good, Sal, you do me real good.
You know what I gonna give you for that Stetson?</p>
<p><strong>sally buck</strong>: Woodsy Niles! The boy!</p>
<p><strong>woodsy</strong>: He don’t know what makes little apples by
now, it’s time he found out.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Smoke?</p>
<p><strong>woodsy</strong>: … git along little dogies!</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Nice talking to you, old timer.</p>
<p><strong>woodsy’s voice</strong>: She-dogs squat, boy. He-dogs stand
up and lift their leg…</p>
<p><strong>woodsy</strong>: … but he-men stand and shoot from the
hip.</p>
<p><strong>veteran</strong>: Ever stationed at Kennedy? Those Florida
chicks…</p>
<p><strong>marine</strong>: Instant V-goddam-D.</p>
<p><strong>veteran</strong>: This Pensacola teeny-bopper – jail bait –
but built? Ten bucks she wanted. Three of us made a deal for,
twenty-five, see, big goddam bargain?</p>
<p><strong>marine</strong>: Big peni-goddam-cillin bargain, right?</p>
<p><strong>veteran</strong>: You got it.</p>
<p><strong>marine</strong>: No. You got it.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Jesus goddam Christ, I ain’t laughed so hard
since I was out at Fort Benning, Georgia.</p>
<p><strong>marine</strong>: Did you make the Viet?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: What? Oh, hell no. Motor pool mostly…
Kee-rist…</p>
<p><strong>prostitute</strong>: Hey, hey, what you try to do to me? You
gonna cost me money, soldier!</p>
<p><strong>sally buck</strong>: Keep your meat hooks off my operators,
sugar, hear?</p>
<p><strong>anastasia</strong>: You’re the only one, Joe, the only, only
one ever!</p>
<p><strong>joe’s reflection</strong>: Gonna swing my lasso and rope that
whole goddam island, yeah!</p>
<p><strong>sally buck’s voice</strong>: There’s a TV dinner in the
fridge, lover boy…</p>
<p><strong>sally buck</strong>: You be okay, won’t you? Maybe I bring
you a treat if you’re a good boy…</p>
<p><strong>sally buck</strong>: I’m so beat, no point you waiting round,
toots, think I’ll stop in for a beer or two…</p>
<p><strong>sally buck</strong>: Expect me when you see me. Looks like I
got me a new beau, lover boy, how’s that for an old grammaw? I’ll leave
you movie money…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Up yours, lady.</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: Hell, he know I can’t read…</p>
<p><strong>joe’s voice</strong>: After all them dishes are washed,
what?</p>
<p><strong>joe’s reflection</strong>: Then they bring some more dishes
and I wash them and then I, uh, sleep some and then wash some more
dishes and then I…</p>
<p><strong>joe’s voice</strong>: Say it, lover boy!</p>
<p><strong>joe’s reflection</strong>: Die.</p>
<p><strong>joe’s voice</strong>: Well, you better just shake your tail,
lover boy, and root, hog or die.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Goddam if I came to this town to write
postcards.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Beg pardon, ma’am, I’m new here in town, just
in from Houston, Texas, and looking for the Statue of Liberty.</p>
<p><strong>rich lady</strong>: Were you looking? About the Statue of
Liberty?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Joking? No, ma’am. Oh no! I mean business!</p>
<p><strong>rich lady</strong>: I’m sorry. I thought you were – never
mind – I’ve never actually been there, but let me see, you take the
Seventh Avenue subway, I think, to the end of the line…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: You sure are a pretty lady.</p>
<p><strong>rich lady</strong>: You’re not looking for the Statue of
Liberty at all.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: No, ma’am, I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>rich lady</strong>: Why, that’s perfectly dreadful. Aren’t
you ashamed of yourself?</p>
<p><strong>cass’s voice</strong>: Hurry up, Baby. Do um goody-goods for
Mama.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Beg pardon, ma’am. I’m brand spanking new to
this town, come from Houston, Texas, and hoping to get a look at the
Statue of Liberty…</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: You’re hoping to get a look at what?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: The Statue of Liberty.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: It’s up in Central Park, taking a leak. If you
hurry, you’ll make the supper show. Now get lost.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Morey? Hi-ee, honey…</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: I’m just out of breath, honey, running to
catch the phone.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: I was walking Baby. Him got to do him
goody-goods, right?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Oh God, oh stop. I can’t stand that. I just
die… It’s Baby, Morey. Him trying to say hello. Say hello to Morey,
Baby.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Okay, old goosie? Now lookie, when do you want
me to meet you? Whatever you say. I’ll take a nap, watch TV, you know,
kill time. Okay, but just one, a big wet one.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Ye gods…</p>
<p><strong>joe’s voice</strong>: Holy shee-it, this is a goddam
penthouse you got here, Cass, a real goddam penthouse.</p>
<p><strong>cass’s voice</strong>: Don’t look, baby…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Say, Cass, I, uh, sure have enjoyed being here.
Believe it’s as fine a time as I’ve had in my life!</p>
<p><strong>cass’s voice</strong>: Me, too, lover.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: That’s good, it is, cause, well I guess I
didn’t tell you why I came to New York, did I?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Zip this thing, will you, Tex?</p>
<p><strong>job</strong>: Truth is, Cass, I’m, well, I’m in business.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Oh, poor you. Morey’s got terrible ulcers.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Don’t know what line Morey’s in, but myself
now, fact is – I’m a hustler.</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Hers’n zodda meg a livig.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Beg pardon, ma’am?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Said, a person’s gotta make a living.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: You sure you heard what I said?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Scuse me, hon, fraid I’m only half here. Maybe
you oughta run on along. But why don’t you take this phone number?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: Darn! I didn’t get to the bank – Tex – could
you let me have a little coin for the taxi-waxi?</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: You’re such a doll. I hate money, don’t you?
God, it’s been fun.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Funny thing, you mentioning money. I was just
about to ask your for some…</p>
<p><strong>cass</strong>: You bastard! You son of a bitch! You think
you’re dealing with some old slut? Look at me! You think just cause
you’re a longhorn bull you can get away with this crap? Well, you’re out
of your mind. I am a gorgeous chick, thirty-one, that’s right, you said
it!</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Hey. Hey, Cass. Did you think I meant that?
Christ, would I be asking you for money with a wad like that riding on
my hip?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Hey. You are a gorgeous-looking piece, Cass.
Guy gets horny, just looking at you. It’s a fact. How much you need for
that taxi? Ten? Twenty? There you go.</p>
<p><strong>ratso’s voice</strong>: Excuse me, I’m just admiring that
colossal shirt…</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: That is one hell of a shirt. I bet you paid a
pretty price for it, am I right?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Oh, it ain’t cheap. I mean, yeah, I’d say this
was an all right shirt. Don’t like to, uh, you know, have a lot of cheap
stuff on my back.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Got a cigarette, cowboy?</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: More goddam faggots in this town.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Shee-it… Kee-rist, you really know the ropes.
Wish to hell I bumped into you before. I’m Joe Buck from Texas and I’m
gonna buy you a drink, what do you say to that?</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: Enrico Rizzo from the Bronx. Don’t mind if I
do.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Same all around! For my friend, too!</p>
<p><strong>tv host</strong>: … and for the losers, who don’t get the
girl, we’ll give as consolation prices – a six month supply of underarm
deodorant…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: … you see what I’m getting at here? She got a
penthouse up there with color TV and more goddam diamonds than an
archbishop and she busts out bawling when I ask for money!</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: For money.</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: For money for what?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I’m a hustler, hell, didn’t you know that?</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: How would I know? You gotta tell a person
these things A hustler? Picking up trade on the street like that – baby,
believe me – you need management.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I think you just put your finger on it, I
do.</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: My friend O’Daniel. That’s who you need.
Operates the biggest stable in town. In the whole goddam metropolitan
area. A stud like you - paying! – not that I blame you – a dame starts
crying, I cut my heart for her…</p>
<p><strong>jackie’s voice</strong>: I’d call that a very minor
operation…</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: … in fact, you just sit comfy and I’ll cut
it out with my fingernail file. You won’t even need Blue Cross,
Ratso.</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: The name is Rizzo.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: That’s what I said, Ratso.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Hey now, you heard him.</p>
<p><strong>tv date girl</strong>: I pick Number Two! He’s cool!</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: That’s okay, Joe. I’m used to these types
that like to pick on cripples. Sewers’re full of ’em.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: May I ask one thing, cowboy? If you sit
there and he sits way over there, how’s he gonna get his hand into your
pocket? But I’m sure he has that all figured out… Good night,
sweets.</p>
<p><strong>tv host</strong>: May present your chosen mate!</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: Look, with these chicks that want to buy it,
most of ’em are older, dignified, right? Social register types. They
can’t be trotting down to Times Square to pick out the merchandise. They
need a middleman, right? That’s O’Daniel.</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: It is a crime, a stud like you passing out
double sawbucks to a chick like that. With proper management you should
be taking home fifty, a hundred bucks a day. More if you wanta
moonlight…</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: Him I placed with O’Daniel just two weeks
ago. And look. Not much of a stud either, what I hear…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Hey, listen, how about you take me to mee this
Mister O’Diddle bird right now?</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: Well, Joe, you’re a nice guy, and I’d be
doing you both a favor, but why? What’m I dragging my bum leg all over
town for? It’s no picnic and what for, for me myself, what?</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: Tomorrow when some piece like that’s
scratching your back in a Fifth Avenue townhouse, where’ll your pal
Rizzo be? Nedicks.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Hold it, just hold it. You think I’m that kinda
sombitch? Just name your cut, whatever you want, you got it right now.
Five? Ten, how’s that?</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: Joe, please. You know what I’d ask anyone
else? Oh hell, tell you what I’ll do, I’ll take the ten… … but when I
hand you over to Mr. O’Daniel, I’ll have to have another ten, Joe; just
to like cover expenses…</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: This boy is just your meat, Mr. O’Daniel,
believe it, I’m telling you – what? – Enrico Rizzo from the Bronx. The
point is he needs you. Right now. Tonight… I got his tongue hanging
out…</p>
<p><strong>ratso’s voice</strong>: Name’s Joe Buck. Cowboy. Just in from
Texas, don’t know the ropes, new to the city, but very promising
material, sir, and ready, if you get what I mean. Fabulous. Right away.
What’s that room number there again?</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: Hold it a second…</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: Nine-oh-one, got it?</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: Let’s see how you look. Fine. You look fine.
Now I’m gonna have to have that other ten…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Ten, ten – I got a twenty – take that…</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: Oh hell, forget it.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Now take it. Go on. Listen, where can I reach
you? Cause I’m gonna make this right with you soon’s I get me set
up…</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I mean, dammit, where you live?</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: Sherry-Netherlands Hotel. Now get your ass in
there. He’s waiting!</p>
<p><strong>o’daniel</strong>: You must be Joe Buck. Come in.</p>
<p><strong>o’daniel</strong>: Am I tickled to find you, boy! Come on in
and let’s get a look at you. Turn around. Good strong back. You’ll need
it. So you want help – take a seat, relax, tell me about yourself.
Cowboy, huh?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: No sir, I’m no cowboy really, but I’m a first
class stud.</p>
<p><strong>o’daniel</strong>: Take it,easy, boy… Seems to me you’re
different than a lotta boys that come to me. Most of ’em seem troubled,
confused, but I’d say you knew exactly what you want.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: You bet I do, sir.</p>
<p><strong>o’daniel</strong>: But I’ll bet you got one thing in common
with them other boys. I’ll bet you’re lonesome.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Well, not too, I mean, a little.</p>
<p><strong>o’daniel</strong>: I’m lonesome. I’m lonesome so I’m a drunk.
I’m lonesome so I’m a dope fiend. I’m lonesome so I’m a thief, a
fornicator, a whore-monger. Poop, I say, poop! I’ve heard it all and I’m
sick of it, sick to death.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Yessir, I can see that.</p>
<p><strong>o’daniel</strong>: Lonesomeness is something you take. You
bear? Dammit, you take it and go about your business, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Well, uh, I’m raring to go.</p>
<p><strong>o’daniel</strong>: Yes, I believe you are. Cowboy, huh?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Uh, yessir.</p>
<p><strong>o’daniel</strong>: Ready for hard work, son?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Ready for anything.</p>
<p><strong>o’daniel</strong>: I got a hunch, Joe Buck, it’s gonna be
easier for you than most.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Gonna be like money from home.</p>
<p><strong>o’daniel</strong>: Money from home, see, there’s your
strength, you put things in earthy terms any man can understand, son. I
warn you I’m gonna use you, I’m gonna run you ragged!</p>
<p><strong>o’daniel</strong>: You’re a wonderful boy. You’n me gonna
have fun, dammit, it don’t have to be joyless. Say, why don’t we get
right down on our knees now?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Get down – where?</p>
<p><strong>o’daniel</strong>: Right here, why not? I prayed in saloons,
I prayed in the street, I prayed an the toilet. He don’t care where,
what He wants is that prayer.</p>
<p><strong>job</strong>: Shee-it…</p>
<p><strong>o’daniel</strong>: That’s the ticket, just open your heart
and let it flow. It ain’t the words, it’s the love beyond ’em!</p>
<p><strong>o’daniel’s voice</strong>: Don’t fight it, boy!</p>
<p><strong>o’daniel</strong>: Pray and you shall be heard!</p>
<p><strong>o’daniel</strong>: Don’t be frightened, son!</p>
<p><strong>o’daniel</strong>: Don’t run from Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Say, you know that runty little bastard I was
with?</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: I don’t know nothing.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Shee-it.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Well, now, ma’am, next time you got that
feeling coming on, you dial Joe Buck. I’ll show you what to do…</p>
<p><strong>singing commercial</strong>: Need a little easy money? It’s
E-Z. Want a little easy cash? It’s E-Z.</p>

Clerk’s sneer, says Joe has to be kidding</p>
<p><strong>joe’s voice</strong>: Key to 1014…</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: Looks like you been locked out of your
room, buddy. Till you pick up your tab.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Uh, what about my things’n all?</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: We keep them nice and safe till you get
this straightened out.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Listen, tell you what, you can keep all the
rest of the goddam junk if you let me have just the suitcase. That
suitcase means a lot to me.</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: We keep everything. House rules.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Screw off.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Any objection, gentlemen?</p>
<p><strong>job</strong>: Y’ain’t gonna eat them?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Shee-it.</p>
<p><strong>sally buck’s voice</strong>: Wet your britches, lover
boy?</p>
<p><strong>middle-age lady</strong>: How do I get to Grand Central?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Shuttle. Follow the green light.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Alright, cowboy. Enough of this shee-it. You
know what you got to do? Then go do it.</p>
<p><strong>joe’s voice</strong>: Twenty-three bucks, I got to have
twenty-three bucks…</p>
<p><strong>fat boy’s voice</strong>: Okay. Sure. I got twenty-five…</p>
<p><strong>anastasia</strong>: You’re the only one, Joe, the only, only
one ever!</p>
<p><strong>anastasia’s voice</strong>: You’re the best, the very best,
yes, yes, kiss me, oh God please kiss me, Joe, now, now, now!</p>
<p><strong>boys’ voices</strong>: Hey, Joe, give someone else a chance!
What’s he doing for chrisake? He kissing Anastasia? You better swallow a
whole goddam drugstore, man!</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I’m awful damn sorry you’re sick, kid, but you
gonna have to gimme that money like you said.</p>
<p><strong>fat boy</strong>: I was lying. I don’t have it. What’re you
going to do to me?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: What you got in your pockets?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: How much’s that worth?</p>
<p><strong>fat boy</strong>: I can’t go home without my watch! My
mother’d die! She’d die! Take my books! Not my watch! She’d die!</p>
<p><strong>desperate voice</strong>: Bill, can I call you Bill, Mister
Bonner? I feel like I know you from listening. What I called about,
Bill, I’m gonna kill myself…</p>
<p><strong>bonner’s voice</strong>: Why call me, baby? If you want to do
it; just do it, don’t talk about it. Are we drunky? Feeling a little
sorry for ourselves maybe?</p>
<p><strong>desperate voice</strong>: Well, Bill, what I got thinking, I
didn’t want the neighbors to have to find me, this young couple with the
boy I want to have my cat, see, Bill?</p>
<p><strong>bonner</strong>: Okay, baby, now listen, just hold on while I
leave the line for a minute. And think about all the kids that are dying
overseas for you, okay, baby? Got that? I’ll be back in exactly sixty
seconds. After this message from…</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: Don’t hit me, I’m a cripple.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Oh, I ain’t gonna hit you, I’m gonna strangle
you to death…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: … only first I’m gonna turn you upside down and
shake you out right here and now.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: What’s in your socks?</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: Not a cent, I swear to God, I swear on my
mother’s eyes.</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: You keep the sixty-four cents. I want you to
have it.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: It’s sticky. What you do, slobber on ’em? I
wouldn’t touch ’em.</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: How do you like that O’Daniel, flipping out
like that? I wanted to get in touch with you when I heard, but I been
laid up with this cold…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: You want some free medical advice, shut your
goddam mouth about that night.</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: Okay, right, right, okay. Another subject.
Where you living? Still at the hotel?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Shee-it. I got better things to do than talk to
you.</p>
<p><strong>ratso’s voice</strong>: Hey, wait up, for crissake!</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Listen, keep away from me, hear? You come near
me again, I snatch you bald-headed!</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: I’m inviting you. I mean if you’re not
located, I got a place. I’m inviting you, goddamit.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: You inviting shee-it.</p>
<p><strong>ratso’s voice</strong>: The X on the window means the
landlord can’t collect rent – which is a convenience, hey? – on account
of it’s condemned.</p>
<p><strong>ratso’s voice</strong>: The electric’s off. Another
convenience. I don’t mess with Con Edison, hey? What the hell, I got
candles, right?</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: I got no heat, but by that time, you know,
cold weather, hey, I’ll be in Florida. Stretch out. Make yourself
comfortable. You hungry? I’ll put up some water for coffee.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Comfortable, kee-rist, I slept on subways
softer than this.</p>
<p><strong>anastasia</strong>: Love me, Joe?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Smart thing for me to do is haul ass outta
here.</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: Whatsa matter now?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: You don’t seem like no fag…</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: What’s that supposed to mean?</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: For crissake!</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Where’s my boots – ?</p>
<p><strong>job</strong>: How’d they get off me?</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: I took ’em off.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: So you could sleep! I mean Christ!</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: I drug in a cot, if you want to stay.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Well now, Ratso, I’m gonna tell you something
for your own good, only first gimme a cigarette.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: You want me to stay here tonight, is that the
idea?</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: I ain’t forcing you, like, I mean, who’s
forcing you?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Oh. Guess I got the wrong impression.</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: I want you to stay, okay? I goddam invited
you, didn’t I?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Well, I hope you know what you’re in for. I’m a
very dangerous person. Someone does me bad like you. If I caught up with
you that night, there’d be one dead Ratso long about now. Hear?</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: I’m impressed. You’re a killer.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: So if you want me to hang around for a few
days, I thought you should know.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Property of the YMCA. You make me wanna puke
sometimes, Ratso.</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: Joe – do me one favor – this is my place, am
I wrong? You know, in my own place my name ain’t Ratso. I mean it so
happens my name is Enrico Salvatore Rizzo.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Shee-it, man, I can’t say all that.</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: Rico then, at least call me Rico in my own
goddam place.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Rico! Rico! Rico! Is that enough? And keep your
meat hooks off my radio.</p>
<p><strong>greengrocer</strong>: You! Out! Out! I told you, I calla
cops!</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Hey, looka here, that ain’t nice, picking on a
cripple…</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: The two basic items necessary to sustain life
are sunshine and coconut milk. That’s a known fact. If I can find the
goddam hole the milk squirts out.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: This is an okay setup you got here, but I’d say
you ain’t just exactly, uh, flush, is that right or not?</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: I been sick. Hold this, will ya?</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: In Florida, they come smooth, ready to eat.
Down there, your only problem is, diet-wise, you gotta lift an arm to
wipe warm milk off your chin. Tough, hey?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I think finding you’s the smartest thing I ever
did, for both of us. You just the crooked kinda sneaky little sidewinder
I need to get me hustling in this town. Hey!</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: Miami Beach is the only place for a real
hustler. Florida has more rich chicks per square yard than any resort
spot in the world. They lie out in their pagodas and pergolas waiting to
grab the first jockstrap that passes.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: What’s all this sweet talk about Florida? Your
friend O’Daniel got a stable down there now?</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: Cowboy killers! Break my finger, Christ! I
got news for you, baby, no chick with any class buys that big dumb
cowboy crap…</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: … the cowboy bit’s out, except among fags of
a certain type, which take a certain, type hustler to exploit. Like I
could handle it – being a stealing operation basically – but take your
average fag, very few of them want a cripple.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Well, I am dumb, that’s for sure. I don’t talk
right. I can’t think too good. Just only one thing I ever been good
for’s loving. Women go crazy for me. Fact. Crazy Annie. Had to send her
away. So I don’t cash in on that, what am I? I’m shee-it. May’s well
flush me down that hole with the dishwater.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: That’s why you gonna stop crapping about
Florida and get your skinny butt moving to earn twenty bucks worth of
management you owe me…</p>
<p><strong>joe’s voice</strong>: Make that twenty-three bucks.</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: Look at yourself, Joe, no offense, but
frankly, you’re beginning to smell. For a stud in this town that’s a
handicap.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: You talk like a man with a tin twat.</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: You ain’t got a chance in hell. You need
threads and glitter, baby. A front, hey?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Well, uh, my manager’s gonna manage all that
crap, or else he gonna get a coconut up his flue.</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: A woman in your condition shouldn’t do that.
Let me help…</p>
<p><strong>joe’s voice</strong>: It ain’t right, stealing from a
pregnant lady.</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: What did it cost her? The laundromat
syndicate lost a couple coins. I’m crying.</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: Where’s mine? The black homburg? I brought it
in the same time.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Hey, you’re good! I bet you could pick up a
living at this if you tried.</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: And end up a hunchback like my old man? You
think I’m crippled? You shoulda caught him the end of a day.</p>
<p><strong>ratso’s voice</strong>: You think it’s funny?</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: Stupid bastard coughed his lungs out
breathing that resin all day. They buried him with gloves on. Even the
fag undertaker couldn’t get his nails clean.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Kee-rist, you pretty damn clever for a skimpy
little gimp.</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: You like it? Take a look.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Don’t rush me. How I do it, see, I get myself
primed, like I was turning on the charm for some pretty little blonde
lady, then kinda mosey away slow and easy and - swing around! – and
there you are, you handsome devil.</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: Not bad – for a cowboy – you’re okay, you’re
okay.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: What I’m gonna do, I’m gonna make a cowboy
outta you, kid. How about that? Build you up a little, teach you couple
little tricks’n turn y’out to stud, Rat-stuff.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Okay, you got yourself one handsome,
sweet-smelling cowboy, strut your stuff…</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: How do you like that? Cheap bastard… I think
we struck gold. This is one high-class chick. The Barbizon for
Women!</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: Mr. McNeill, I’m calling for Miss Beecham at
the Barbizon Hotel for Women. She won’t need you tonight…</p>
<p><strong>ratso’s voice</strong>: Would you believe a whole goddam
hotel with nothing but lonely chicks?</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: Score once in that setup, the way chicks
talk, Christ…</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: Get the money! Remember Cass Trehune? Cash!
These rich bitches write a check at night, call the bank and stop
payment in the morning. Get the cash!</p>
<p><strong>bellhop</strong>: Hey! No men upstairs!</p>
<p><strong>miss beecham</strong>: I’m afraid there’s been a terrible
mistake…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I want my money, goddamit, you owe me my money
whether you get laid or not, lady, shee-it!</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Shee-it. Cough yourself inside out, then light
a fag, a goddam fag. You make me puke. Where’d you steal it? In the
movies?</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: The coat? A guy I did a favor once gave it to
me. Christ.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Who’d you ever do a favor for? You just let
some poor bastard freeze to death, wouldn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: Where’d that come from?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Forty-second Street. Where’n hell you think it
come from?</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: You wanna know the truth? You dumb bastard, I
got it for you. Look at it. Goddam thing’s ten sizes too big for me.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Wear it yourself. I wouldn’t put it on my
back.</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: Goddamned if I’ll wear it!</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Go get your medicine. Before you die on my
goddam, hands…</p>
<p><strong>joe’s voice</strong>: Shee-it. I hate boneyards.</p>
<p><strong>ratso’s voice</strong>: So split. He ain’t your goddam,
father.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Kee-rist, you sure are one twisty little
bastard, Ratso.</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: The name’s Rico, at my own father’s grave, a
man deserves some respect.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Respect shee-it! You even steal flowers for his
grave.</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: Can he smell the difference, eh?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Well, uh, he dam well know he ain’t ‘be-loved
Aunt Winifred’.</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: He can’t read. Even dumber than you. Couldn’t
write his own name. X – that’s what it ought to say there on that goddam
headstone. One big lousy X like our flat. Condemned. By order of City
Hall.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: My Grammaw Sally Buck, she died without letting
me know.</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: Just keep your hat on and cry a little. They
tip you when it’s over.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Just ain’t right, cheating someone dead and
can’t cheat back.</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: You and my old man. Same kinda mind. Putting
me down till the day he died… … why can’t you be like your brothers?
Sons a father could be proud of. Yeah, sure. My brothers. Too goddam
busy making something of themselves to show up when the old man’s
dying!</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: What was that all about?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: You wanna read something, read this. I been
invited somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: They picked me. The only one in the whole
goddam place. You see how they looked me over, up and down before they
give me that?</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Well, this thought just struck me. It wasn’t
too long ago I was washing dishes way the hell somewhere in Texas.</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: Yeah, well, so?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Now I’m here. I’m in New York City. Getting
picked for things. Don’t you see what I’m driving at?</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: What you’re driving at, you want me to get
lost so you can go to your fancy-ass party.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Did I say that? Did I? It don’t say nothing
about you…</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: Don’t say nothing about you either.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: But they picked me, right? So what I’ll do,
I’ll just say, now look, you want me? Well, I don’t go nowhere without
my buddy here.</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: Well, what the hell, I got nothing better to
do.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Better dry your hair some. You sweating all
over the goddam place.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: You got a comb?</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: Don’t need a comb.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Few dozen cooties won’t kill me, don’t
guess.</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: Okay? I look okay?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Better get a hold of someone and tell them I’m
here.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Well, I made it. This here is Ratso Rizzo and
I…</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: Rico. Rico Rizzo.</p>
<p><strong>hansel</strong>: Do you need anything? I mean there’s beer
and so forth. Whatever your thing is…</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: If you want the word on that brother and
sister act, I’ll give you the word. That Hansel’s a fag and Gretel’s got
the hots for herself. So who cares, right? Load up on the salami…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Shee-it, this is one helluva party!</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: I can tell, can’t you?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Yeah, oh yeah.</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: What’ll we do? Leave now or what? Your
place or mine? Oh God, the second I looked at you I knew. Did you?</p>
<p><strong>ratso’s voice</strong>: She’s hooked…</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: … I’d say she was good for ten bucks, but
I’ll ask for twenty…</p>
<p><strong>shirley’s voice</strong>: Did you know? We were going to make
it?</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: You really want to do business?</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: Who’s he? Oh God! Don’t tell me you two are
a couple – ?</p>
<p><strong>hansel’s voice</strong>: Why are you laughing, Joe?</p>
<p><strong>hansel</strong>: Are you for real, Joe?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Well, I ain’t a f’real cowboy, but I’m one hell
of a stud!</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: A very expensive stud. And I happen to be his
manager.</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: It’s too much – to come face to face with a
walking talking sex fantasy – to buy a man’s – God!</p>
<p><strong>shirley’s voice</strong>: I can’t wait to tell my man Monday.
I should be taking notes. Look at my arm!</p>
<p><strong>ratso’s voice</strong>: I gotta sit down. I feel crummy.</p>
<p><strong>shirley’s voice</strong>: Eat it – a man in your line of work
has to keep his strength up…</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: It’s fantastic, now I know, everything you
do has sexual implications. If I you know, bought it – could I take
pictures of you naked? That’s part of it, isn’t it, kinky kinda
things?</p>
<p><strong>hansel’s voice</strong>: We want you, Joe. You’ve been
chosen.</p>
<p><strong>shirley’s voice</strong>: I had a thing for him. Before I
knew. Why should knowing make it more of a thing?</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: Naturally I’ll have to ask myself why a
cowboy? And why a cowboy whore? But not tonight.</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: Incidentally, how much is this going to
cost me anyway?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Tell her, Ratso.</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: Twenty bucks…</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: Sold. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: … and taxi fare for me.</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: Get lost.</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: I agree. And for that service I charge one
dollar taxi fare.</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: Your name’s Joe. Which is fabulous. Joe
could be anyone. Kiss me, Joe, move over, Joe, go away, Joe. It’s just
perfect.</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: He fell. Hey, fella, you fell. Is he all
right?</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: Is he all right!</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Well, if you’re awright, why you hanging on the
bannister. Can you walk or not?</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: Walk? Naturally I can walk.</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: He’s got taxi fare.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Sure you’re all right?</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: I said yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah!</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Whoopee ti yi yo…!</p>
<p><strong>shirley’s voice</strong>: That happens. Don’t worry about
it…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Well, that’s something never happened to me
before, you can bet your bottom dollar. Uh, where’s the matches,
ma’am?</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: Top drawer. Maybe if you didn’t call me
ma’am, things would work out better.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: First goddam, time it ever quit on me.
Fact.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: You think I’m lying!</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: No. Of course not. Just something struck me
funny…</p>
<p><strong>shirley’s voice</strong>: I just put myself in your shoes. I
had this image of a bugler without a horn, a policeman without a stick,
etcetera, etcetera and I… I think I’d better shut up, I’m making it
worse.</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: Maybe we should take a little nap, see what
happens?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I ain’t sleepy.</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: I know. Scribbage!</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Shee-it…</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: That’s pretty Freudian, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: What? It’s a perfectly good word, ain’t it. How
much time I got? Goddam sand thing drive you crazy. Kee-rist. Spelling
never was a very strong point with me. Even in school.</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: If you didn’t talk so much, maybe you could
think more.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Talking helps. Don’t talk, you get muddled in
your head. Hey! Now you just look at this here!</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: There’s an E in MONEY. If that’s your
word.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: M-O-N-Y – I’m right! That’s just exactly how
they spell it up there on that big building, bet you could see it from
here. M-O-N-Y.</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: Okay. Never argue with a man.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Y – what in hell starts with Y?</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: It can end in Y day, pay, lay – hey, pay
lay!</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Cut it out. That’s cheating, teasing me so I
can’t think. Just one bitsy Y word and I gonna beat you!</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: You gonna beat me, Joe?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Beat your butt, you don’t lemme think!</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: Gay ends in Y. Fey. You like that – gay fey
– is that your problem?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I show you what problem –</p>
<p><strong>joe’s voice</strong>: Whoopee ti yi yo…</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: Well, I really can’t talk now, if you know
what I mean, but believe me when I say, Myra, it’s an experience every
emancipated woman owes herself. I’m not. I’m not exaggerating. Well,
what’s Phil’s poker night? Joe – are you available next Thursday,
eight-thirty?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Well, lemme think now, Thursday, eight-thirty,
yeah, I guess I could be available. Hell, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: Why don’t you just come here? I’ll be
working every night this week. I’ll leave a key with the super…</p>
<p><strong>joe’s voice</strong>: Well, ma’am – Shirley – I sure hate to
trouble you, but…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: See what you think of that crap. I’ll pour your
soup. Got some of that junk you like to swill, too. Mentholatum.
Aspirin. All that shee it…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: They wrong?</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: No. But while you was buying the underwear, I
could have lifted the socks.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: You couldn’t lift fly specks from a sugar bowl.
Can you hold this?</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: But thanks. Hey, Joe, don’t get sore about
this or anything. You promise?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: Well, I don’t think I can walk. I mean, I
been falling down a lot and, uh…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: And what?</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: I’m scared.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: What of?</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: What’ll happen. I mean what they do to, you
know, do with you – if you can’t – ah, Christ!</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: I don’t know. Cops. Or the – how should I
know?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Okay. Here it is. You gonna go see the doctor.
I got nine bucks and twenty more Thursday and I gonna be riding high
before you know it. So you gonna get you the best goddam doctor in this
town and get yourself straightened out, that’s what.</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: No doctors. No, sir. Not me. Doctors are like
goddam auto mechanics. Fix one-thing, unplug another. Operate for piles
and while they’re there, they unscrew your liver. My old man, for God’s
sake, wasn’t any sicker’n I am when he went to the doctor.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Well, just exactly what the hell you think
you’re gonna do? Die on me?</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: I’m going to Florida, that’s my only
chance.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: You know what’s wrong with you? You got fevers.
You kinky as a bedbug. How you gonna get to Florida?</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: I’ll find the money. If you just get me on
the bus, that’s all I ask.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Just when everything’s going my way, you gotta
pull a stunt like this.</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: I don’t even want you to go. Whaddya think of
that? I got other plans for my life than dragging around some dumb
cowboy that thinks he’s God’s gift to women. One twenty-buck trick and
he’s already the biggest stud in New York City. It’s laughable.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: When I put you on that bus down to Florida
tonight, that’ll be the happiest day of my life!</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Hey, Shirley… Miss who? Oh, yeah, well, when
will Missus Gardner be home? … I’m a friend of hers, a goddam good
friend… Shee-it, I can’t wait till then…</p>
<p><strong>towny’s voice</strong>: Bravo…</p>
<p><strong>towny</strong>: How are you? Townsend P. Locke, from Chicago.
Call me Towny. I’m here to attend a paper manufacturers’ convention and,
frankly, to have a little fun, dammit…</p>
<p><strong>towny</strong>: This is my first night in town and I’ll
consider it a ghastly omen clouding my entire ten days, if you don’t
consent to have dinner with me. Anywhere you like…</p>
<p><strong>towny</strong>: … never mind how you’re dressed. They know
me. I’ll say you’re with the rodeo. There’s always a rodeo in New York,
dammit. Besides, you look very elegant…</p>
<p><strong>towny</strong>: But, dammit all, I just remembered, we’ll
have to eat in my room because I have this phone call coming at
nine-thirty…</p>
<p><strong>towny</strong>: What I like about you, you’re such a
wonderful conversationalist. So won’t that be nice to have dinner sent
up?</p>
<p><strong>towny</strong>: Fifty years ago this was the only hotel in
Manhattan. My mother always calls me at her bedtime, so I’ve got to be
there.</p>
<p><strong>towny</strong>: A drink? I’ve got some nice gin. If you’d
prefer something else, they’ll send it up…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Gin’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>towny</strong>: It’s so exciting. New York. The mad forward
thrust of everything. My sense of time here is completely altered.</p>
<p><strong>towny</strong>: Sometimes it seems to me time stopped twenty
years ago. There was this war, there was this handsome young man with
quite black hair and he was supposed to die. But he didn’t. Isn’t that
amusing?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>towny</strong>: Enough about me. I’m through talking for the
evening. Now I want to hear about conditions in the West. The romance of
the West holds a tremendous power over me. Mother was actually a pioneer
woman, can you believe it? When she calls, I’ll introduce you and she’ll
be so thrilled.</p>
<p><strong>towny’s voice</strong>: Mama, a coincidence. Guess who was
being discussed. Discussed. Not disgusted. Discussed! Do you have that
thing turned up? Why aren’t you wearing it! This is impossible!</p>
<p><strong>joe’s voice</strong>: Listen, Towny, did I mention I got a
sick kid?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Well, he is, he’s sicker’n shee-it. And I’ve
gotta get him South quick as I can…</p>
<p><strong>towny</strong>: I was so childish with her.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: What d’you want?</p>
<p><strong>towny</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: What you got me up here for?</p>
<p><strong>towny</strong>: Oh, difficult, it’s so difficult. You’re a
nice person, Joe – I should never have asked you up – a lovely person.
Oh, how I loathe life. I loathe it. Please go. Please.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: You want me to leave?</p>
<p><strong>towny</strong>: No, yes. No, I mean yes please go. Help me to
be good. Come back tomorrow. Promise.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I’m going to Florida.</p>
<p><strong>towny</strong>: This is terrible. I meet someone who – then –
wait, I want to give you a present. For your trip. You’ll let me
please…</p>
<p><strong>towny</strong>: Please take it. You don’t have to be
Catholic. Saint Christopher is the patron saint of all travelers. I want
you to have it. For helping me be good.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Listen, I gotta have money.</p>
<p><strong>towny</strong>: Oh. Yes. Of course. I should have thought.
You shouldn’t have to ask. That was thoughtless of me. Yes. Wait
here…</p>
<p><strong>towny</strong>: Here. Don’t even thank me.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I gotta have more’n ten. I gotta have
fifty-seven dollars.</p>
<p><strong>towny</strong>: I simply don’t have it, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Get outta my way.</p>
<p><strong>towny</strong>: You’re wasting your time. There’s nothing in
there.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Let go. Let go of the table.</p>
<p><strong>towny</strong>: I deserved that, I know I did.</p>
<p><strong>towny</strong>: I brought this on myself. I’m bleeding, my
nose is bleeding, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: You wanna gimme fifty-seven dollars or you
wanna busted skull?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Please let go of that table.</p>
<p><strong>towny</strong>: Thank you, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: Thirty-one hours.</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: The trip is. Nine-thirty in the morning we
get there. Not this morning but the next one at nine thirty.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: These guys’re good drivers.</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: They gotta be.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: You get your first palm tree in South
Carolina.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: How’n hell a dumb Bronx kid like you know
that?</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: I read it.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Shee-it. You believe all you read?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: If you have to shiver, why don’t you pull the
blanket up more?</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: I been thinking. I hope we’re not gonna have
a lotta trouble about my name down there. Because like what’s the whole
point of this trip anyway?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Keep the goddam blanket on.</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: I mean New York’s one thing, but can you see
this guy, imagine it, running around the goddam beach all suntan and
he’s going in swimming, like, and then somebody yells ‘Hey, Ratso’ – how
does that sound to you?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Sounds like they knew you.</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: Sounds like crap, admit it. And I’m not gonna
have it. I’m Rico all the time, okay, do you blame me? That’s agreed,
okay? We’re gonna tell all these new people my name’s Rico?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Hey – whatsa matter?</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: I’m wet.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: You’re what?</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: I wet my pants! My seat’s all wet.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Hell, don’t cry about it!</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: Here I am going to Florida and my leg hurts,
my butt hurts, my chest hurts, my face hurts, and like that ain’t
enough, I gotta pee all over myself.</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: I’m falling apart, that’s funny?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: You just – just – what happened, you just had a
little rest stop wasn’t on the schedule.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Hey, what size pants you wear?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Couple crullers’n coffee to go.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Where you from?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: New York.</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: Hey, what the hell you doing?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I’m zipping your fly, what the hell you think
I’m doing?</p>
<p><strong>ratso</strong>: Thanks, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Shee-it, you know, I got this thing all figured
out, Ratso. I mean Rico. When we get to Miami, what I’ll do, I’ll go to
work. I gotta do that, ’cause see, I ain’t no kind of a hustler. I ain’t
even any goddam good as a bum. I’m a nothing, that’s what I am. So
reckon I’d better go to work and get me a goddam job. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Yeah, guess that’s what I’m gonna do.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Yes, sir?</p>
<p><strong>joe,</strong>: My friend’s dead in the back seat.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Your friend’s what in the back seat?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Dead. Dead as a doornail.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Is this some kind of…</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Okay, folks, everything’s fine. Nothing to
worry about.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Is he kin to you?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Don’t you want to close his eyes?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Close them?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Just reach over and close them. That’s
all.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: I guess we’ll just drive on, right? Nothing
else to do.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: No, sir. Not till Miami. I’ll see to burying
then.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Just a little sickness, folks, nothing
serious. We’ll be in Miami… … in forty minutes.</p>
