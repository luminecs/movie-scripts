while the money’s still floating, huh? Okay… Go ahead. Set ’em up.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: All right, you want some easy money, huh?

Hustler.</p>

<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Any table?</p>
<p><strong>cashier</strong>: Any table.</p>

<p><strong>big john</strong>: You well-heeled, partner?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: We got enough.</p>
<p><strong>big john</strong>: Go home. Take your boy and go home. Fats

<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You got that wrong, mister. I am.</p>

<p><strong>eddie</strong>: How long have you been waiting?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Since four.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Just a cup of black coffee, please… Hey,

<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Have a nice trip?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Fair.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Can I sit down?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Why not? We already know each other’s
secrets.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Thanks for the, uh, for the breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Two ships that pass in the night should
always buy each other breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Can I buy you another drink?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Hey, another one for me and another one for
the lady.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Check!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You look different… More relaxed.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: It’s the lights. And the scotch.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: How come you didn’t catch your bus?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I wasn’t waiting for a bus.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Then why go to the bus station?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Same reason you went: at that hour of the
morning you haven’t much choice. Besides, I only live three blocks from
there. Where do you live?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Around.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I know where you live: in a locker, in a bus
station. What’s it like living in a locker?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Cramped. You always drink like this, so early
in the morning?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Do you always ask so many questions?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: No, not always.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Sometimes I wake up and I can’t sleep, not
without a drink. The bars don’t open until eight. Mack over there has
faith in me. When I’m broke, he trusts me. Don’t you trust me, Mack?</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Check!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: When I’m not broke, I usually have a bottle
in my room, in which case I sleep very well indeed.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You talk kind of funny, but I like it.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I used to be an actress.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Yeah? What do you do now?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I’m a college girl. Two days a week, Tuesdays
and Thursdays, I go to college.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You don’t look like a college girl.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I’m the emancipated type. Real
emancipated.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: No, I didn’t mean that – whatever that means.
I mean, you just don’t look young enough.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: So why go to college?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I’ve got nothing else to do on Tuesdays and
Thursdays.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What do you do on the other days?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I drink.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: No. No more. I’m getting sleepy. Thank you
very much, Mr…?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Eddie. The name is Eddie.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: The name should be Eddie. What should my name
be?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I don’t know. Whatever you like it to be.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I like it to be what it is. It’s Sarah.
That’s a biblical name. You want to know its meaning?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I could always get us a bottle.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Fifth of scotch?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: What do you want me to do, just step out in
the alley? Is that it?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: No. I’ll take you home.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: It’s all right. I’m not drunk… I’m lame.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Why me?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Please… please… please.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You’re too hungry.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Take it. It’s yours.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: You can have this one for a buck and a half
a night, or seven bucks by the week.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: By the night.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: In advance.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Bottle of beer.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Hey, uh, mister? Hey, okay if I grab a
cue?</p>
<p><strong>player</strong>: Hey, you’re Eddie Felson, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Who’s he?</p>
<p><strong>player</strong>: Now, look, fella, I saw you playing at Ames
the other night.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Hey, I’ll tell you what – I’ll play you
jack-up pool – just keep one hand in my pocket.</p>
<p><strong>player</strong>: Oh man, you’re way out of our league.</p>
<p><strong>first man</strong>: What are you stuck for?</p>
<p><strong>second man</strong>: Three. That’s enough for me.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Thanks… Can I, uh, buy you fellas a
drink?</p>
<p><strong>men</strong>: Okay… Okay.</p>
<p><strong>first man</strong>: You know, you shoot good. But you also
shoot lucky.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Yeah. I shoot lucky.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Why did you do that?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I wanted to see what kind of a day it is.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: A day like any other. People come, people
go.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Give me a drag.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Eleven o’clock… I’ll be back later.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Come here.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Oh, you need a shave. You mustn’t go looking
like that. There’s a razor and shaving cream in the bathroom.
Compliments of the house.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What did you say that for, Sarah?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: How did you know my name was Sarah?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You told me.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I lied. When I’m drunk I lie.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Okay. So what’s your name today?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Sarah. Eddie, look. I’ve got troubles, and I
think maybe you’ve got troubles. Maybe it’d be better if we just leave
each other alone.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I got my things over at the hotel. I’ll bring
them over later… Come here.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I’m not sure… I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Well, what do you want to know? And why?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Prego.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Where you been all day?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: At school. It’s Thursday.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Oh, I forgot.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You were asleep when I left. I didn’t want to
wake you. Did you go out?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Yeah, I went out for a couple of hours.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Present…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You know, I’ve been living here for almost
three years. Now in three days it seems as if I know everybody. When I
pass people on the street I want to stop and say, “Listen, I got a
fella.”</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Eddie, where do you go when you go out?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Museums… art galleries… concerts.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Well, I believe you when you say you go to
school.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You want to go with me?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What, are you kidding? See that book? I’ve
been trying to get through that book ever since I first got here. I
haven’t finished the first chapter. Did you read all them books?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Mm hmm.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You got it all in your head?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: When I’m sober. They get a little mixed up
when I’m drunk. Most of the time they’re mixed up.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Oh, stop talking about yourself like you’re a
lush or something. I don’t like it. Maybe you ought to go to a clinic,
get some treatments.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I’m getting treatments right here.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I’m hungry.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Take your choice. I’ve got enough so we won’t
have to go out of the house till Tuesday.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What did all this stuff cost you?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: When you’ve got money, you’ll pay.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: No, c’mon, I wanna know. I wanna keep
score.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: The bills are right here. You didn’t say what
you wanted.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Don’t you ever cook anything?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Eggs. How do you like them?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Raw.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Oh, cut my finger.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I’ve got something in my bag.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Oh, it’s not bad.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Eddie, what’s in that case?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Haven’t you opened it?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: No, why should I? It’s yours.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: It’s a machine gun. This guy told me when I
came to the big city I’d have to have a machine gun, so I bought one.
Where do you get the money? To pay for all this? I mean the liquor, and
the groceries, and the rent?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: From a rich old man who used to be my
lover.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Hello, Eddie.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Hello, Charlie… C’mon in… That’s my girl.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Hello, Eddie’s girl… I looked all over for
you.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Oh yeah? How’d you find me?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I asked around.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Do you want me to go?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: No, stick around. Can I get you something?
Drink? Coffee?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Oh, I don’t want to be no bother to
nobody.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Oh, don’t play it small, Charlie. It don’t
look good on you.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: How do you want me to play it? I’m
broke.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: So am I… Sit down. Would you get us a couple
of drinks?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You walked out on me like that. No goodbye,
no nothing. Like a thief in the dark. We were partners. We were more
than partners. He was like a… like –</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: A son.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Yeah, yeah, like a son. I’ve known this boy
since he was sixteen. The first time I saw him, back in Oakland, I said,
“This is a talented boy. This is a smart boy.”</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Talk to me, Charlie.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I want you to come back on the road with
me.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Aah! I’ve got no stomach for that any more.
I’ve had that kind of life.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What kind of life have you got here?
Scufflin’ around the small rooms, picking up eight, ten bucks a day?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I’ll connect. I’ll get you your money
back.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Are you figuring on going back to Ames to
play Minnesota Fats again? Is that what’s on your mind?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Never been out of it. I’m gonna beat that fat
man… with that curly hair, and those diamond rings, and that
carnation.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: This boy’s crazy. They wiped the floor with
him. They beat his brains out and he wants to go back. What for? To take
another beating?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I told you you’d get your money back.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: He thinks I care about the money. I care
about you. Do you care about me, Eddie? We’re together a long time,
night and day. So how do you say goodbye? You gimme the car and a
hundred bucks. You think I care about the dough, the car? I care about
you. This boy is the greatest pool hustler you ever saw. A real
high-class con man. He can charm anybody into anything. Did he ever tell
you how well we were doing on the road? We had everything: we ate good,
we slept late, we had money to burn. Whisky, dames… Excuse me… I’ll tell
you what – take her along.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’ll tell you what else: you don’t want to
start right away, we won’t start right away. We’ll get in the car and
drive down to Miami, get all this crud out of your system, have a few
laughs, lie in the sun for a couple of weeks.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: With what?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Don’t worry about it. I’ll raise the
money.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Oh yeah? Where?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What’s the difference where? I’ll raise it.
Is it all right if I have another drink?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Did you hold out on me, Charlie?… How
much?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: HOW MUCH?!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: My twenty-five per cent. Approximately
fifteen hundred bucks.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Oh, you crumb. With that fifteen hundred I
coulda beat him. That’s all I needed, Charlie.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Aw, Eddie.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: C’mon, c’mon, just give me the money.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What for? To play Fats again?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Yeah, to play Fats again.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You wanna come back on the road with me,
okay, the money’s yours. But if you wanna give it to Minnesota Fats…
nothing doing. What do you say?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You still don’t see it, do you, Charlie? You
are nothing but a small- time Charlie. You’d love to keep me hustling
for you, huh? Wouldn’t ya? I mean, a couple more years with me,
scuffling around them little towns and those back alleys. You might make
yourself enough to get a little poolroom back in Oakland. Six tables and
a handbook on the side. Is that when you say goodbye to me, Charlie?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Is that what you think?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Yeah, that’s what I think.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: All right. That’s what I want. Poolroom
with a little handbook on the side. Getting old.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Lay down and die by yourself. Don’t take me
with you.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Just like that?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Yeah. Just like that.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Thanks for the drink, Eddie’s girl.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Give me another drink.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Boy! Everybody, everybody wants a piece of
me!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Aren’t you gonna have one?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What did he have to come back here for
anyway?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: C’mere.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Come here!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You going out?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Yeah. For a little while.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Ohhhhh…</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Okay?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What are you writing?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Oh, it’s a story. A story I’m making up.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Give it to me.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What’s this supposed to mean?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Give it back to me.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What’s this supposed to mean: “We have a
contract of depravity. All we have to do is pull the blinds down.”</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Write yourself another story.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Well, what else have we got? We never talk
about anything. We stay here in this room, and we drink, and we make
love. We’re strangers. What happens when the liquor and the money run
out, Eddie?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You told Charlie to lay down and die. Will
you say that to me too? What happens, Eddie?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You’ll find yourself another rich old
lover.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: That’s right! And I’m sure you’ll help
me.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You waiting for me to cry? You bum… You
poolroom bum.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Give me a bottle of beer.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: How did you make out?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I made a couple of bucks.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Poker game?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Is it open?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: It’s open… What’ll you have?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Gimme a beer.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Okay?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Sit down.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What’s the limit?</p>
<p><strong>player</strong>: Half and a dollar.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Gimme ten bucks.</p>
<p><strong>player</strong>: Ten dollars.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Make it twenty.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Cut.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Deal.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Bourbon. J. T. S. Brown.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Two.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: I’m buyin’.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Thought you only drank milk.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Only when I work.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Yeah? Why?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: I like it. It’s good for you. Besides, you
start drinking whisky gambling and it gives you an excuse for losing.
That’s something you don’t need – an excuse for losing. How did you make
out in the poker game?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I lost twenty bucks.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Poker’s not your game.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What is?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Pool.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You being cute?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: I don’t think there’s a pool player alive
shoots better pool than I saw you shoot the other night at Ames. You got
talent.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: So I got talent. So what beat me?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Character.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Yeah. Sure, sure.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: You’re damned right I’m sure. Everybody’s got
talent. I got talent. You think you can play big-money straight pool, or
poker, for forty straight hours on nothing but talent? You think they
call Minnesota Fats the best in the country just ’cause he’s got talent?
Nah. Minnesota Fats’s got more character in one finger than you got in
your whole skinny body.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I got drunk.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: He drank as much whisky as you did.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Maybe he knows how to drink.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: You bet he knows how. You think that’s a
talent too, huh? Knowin’ how to drink whisky? You think Minnesota Fats
was born knowin’ how to drink?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Okay, okay… What do I do now, lie down on the
floor and, uh, bow from the ankles? What do I do, go home?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: That’s your problem.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: So I stay. Stay until I hustle up enough to
play Fats again. Maybe by that time I’ll develop myself some
character.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Maybe by that time you’ll die of old age. How
much do you think you’ll, uh, need?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: A thousand.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: No, three thousand at least. He’ll start you
off at five hundred a game – he’ll beat the pants off you. That’s the
way he plays when he comes up against a man who knows the way the game
is. He’ll beat you flat four or five games – maybe more, depending on
how, uh… steady your nerves are. But he might – he just might be a
little scared of you, and that could change things. But I wouldn’t count
on it.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: How do you know? Huh? When nobody knows that
much?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: See that big car parked out by the fireplug on
the way in? Well, that’s mine. I like that car. But I get a new one
every year because I make it my business to know what guys like you and
Minnesota Fats are gonna do. I made enough off of you the other night to
pay for it twice over.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: In that case, you owe me another drink.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Eddie, is it all right if I get personal?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Whaddya been so far?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Eddie, you’re a born loser.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What’s that supposed to mean?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: First time in ten years I ever saw Minnesota
Fats hooked, really hooked. But you let him off.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I told you. I got drunk.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Sure, you got drunk. That’s the best excuse in
the world for losing. No trouble losing when you got a good excuse. And
winning! That can be heavy on your back too. Like a monkey. You drop
that load too when you got an excuse. All you gotta do is learn to feel
sorry for yourself. It’s one of the best indoor sports: feeling sorry
for yourself – a sport enjoyed by all, especially the born losers.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Thanks for the drink.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Wait a minute. Maybe I can help you.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: To do what?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Get the three thousand. Play Minnesota Fats
again.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Ten reasons. Maybe fifteen. And also there’s
something in it for me.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Oh yeah, I figured that. How much?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Seventy-five per cent.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: For who?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: For me.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: That’s a – that’s a pretty big slice. Who do
you think you are, General Motors?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: How much you think you’re worth these days?
I’m puttin’ up the money, I’m puttin’ up the time. For that I get
seventy-five per cent return on my money – if you win.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You think I can lose?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: I never saw you do anything else.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You saw me beat Minnesota Fats for eighteen
thousand dollars.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Look, you wanna hustle pool, don’t you? This
game isn’t like football. Nobody pays you for yardage. When you hustle
you keep score real simple. The end of the game you count up your money.
That’s how you find out who’s best. That’s the only way.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Why back me then? Why not back yourself? Go
find yourself a big fat poker game and get rich. You know all the
angles.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: I’m already rich. But I like action. That’s
one thing I think you’re good for is action. Besides, like I say… you
got talent.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Yeah, you already told me that. You cut that
slice down to bite-size and maybe we can talk.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: No, we don’t talk. I don’t make bad bets.
Seventy-five, twenty-five. That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Kiss off.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Hey, wait. What are you gonna do about the
money?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: There are places. I’ll scuffle around.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Word’s out on you, Eddie. You walk in the
wrong kind of place and they’ll eat you alive.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Now, when did you adopt me?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: I don’t know when it was.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>player</strong>: You lucky punk. I quit ya.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: You want in, friend?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: How much you playin’ for?</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: A dollar on the five, two on the
nine.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Yeah, I’ll play you a couple. Just for
kicks.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Okay, friend.</p>
<p><strong>player</strong>: That’s it for me.</p>
<p><strong>another player</strong>: Well, I guess that does it for me
too.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: You quittin’ too?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You’re a pretty good player.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: How much are you ahead?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Couple of bucks.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: I guess it’s just you and me, huh?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Yeah, I guess it is, boy. Just you and
me.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: You wanna raise the bet? Two on the five,
five on the nine?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You know what, kid? I think maybe you’re a
hustler.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Try me.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Shoot.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: You sure you don’t want to quit,
friend?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Let’s cut out the small stuff, huh? Hundred
dollar freeze-out. Ten games, ten bucks a game, winner take all. And
then we’ll see who quits.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Okay, friend. You’re on.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Call it.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Heads.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: You win.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: You better not miss, friend.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I don’t rattle, kid. But just for that I’m
gonna beat you flat.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: That’s one.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: That’s five.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: That’s six.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: That’s ten. You punk, you two-bit punk.
C’mon, pay up. A hundred bucks.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You quittin’, friend?</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Yeah, I’m quittin’.</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: Why, you’re a pool shark, boy. A real pool
shark.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Well, so’s he.</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: But you’re better than he was. Much better.
There’s your money, boy.</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: There’s your money, boy.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: Wait a minute! Let’s give this boy his money.
We always pay what we lose, boy.</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: We got no use for pool sharks around here.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Me. It’s Eddie.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I got beat up. They… They broke my
thumbs.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Oh, God!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Oh, they broke my thumbs. Broke my
thumbs.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: It’s all right. I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You can read it, if you want to. You want to
go out for a while? To a movie?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You wanna drink?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: No. You?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What’s it so hot in here for?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Please!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Sarah, do you think I’m a loser?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: A loser?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Yeah. I met this guy – Gordon, Bert Gordon.
He said I was. Born loser.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Would he know?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: He knows. A lot.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Why did he tell you?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I don’t know. I’m not sure. He said there are
people who want to lose, who are always looking for an excuse to
lose.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: What does he do, this Bert Gordon?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: He’s a gambler.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Is he a winner?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Well, he owns things.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Is that what makes a winner?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Well, what else does?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Does it bother you? What he said?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Yeah. Yeah. It bothers me a lot. ‘Cause, you
see, twice, Sarah – once at Ames with Minnesota Fats and then again at
Arthur’s… …in that cheap, crummy poolroom… Now, why’d I do it, Sarah?
Why’d I do it? I coulda beat that guy, I coulda beat him cold. He never
woulda known. But I just had to show ’em, I just had to show those
creeps and those punks what the game is like when it’s great, when it’s
really great. You know, like anything can be great – anything can be
great… I don’t care, bricklaying can be great. If a guy knows. If he
knows what he’s doing and why, and if he can make it come off. I mean,
when I’m goin’ – when I’m really goin’ – I feel like… …like a jockey
must feel. He’s sittin’ on his horse, he’s got all that speed and that
power underneath him, he’s comin’ into the stretch, the pressure’s on
him – and he knows – just feels – when to let it go, and how much.
‘Cause he’s got everything workin’ for him – timing, touch. It’s a great
feeling, boy, it’s a real great feeling when you’re right, and you know
you’re right. It’s like all of a sudden I got oil in my arm. Pool cue’s
part of me. You know, it’s a – pool cue’s got nerves in it. It’s a piece
of wood – it’s got nerves in it. You feel the roll of those balls. You
don’t have to look. You just know. Ya make shots that nobody’s ever made
before. And you play that game the way nobody’s ever played it
before.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You’re not a loser, Eddie. You’re a winner.
Some men never get to feel that way about anything. I love you,
Eddie.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You know, someday, Sarah, you’re gonna settle
down. You’re gonna marry a college professor, and you’re gonna write a
great book. Maybe about me, huh? Fast Eddie Felson, hustler.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You need the words?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Yes, I need them very much. And if you ever
say them I’ll never let you take them back.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You glad?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Yes, I’m glad.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Hello, Eddie.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Hi. How’s business?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Ahh, slow… Why the open hand bridge? Something
wrong with your hand?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Yeah. Had a little accident. A place called
Arthur’s.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Oh. You seem to do all right that way.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I’d say my game is about twenty per cent off.
Maybe more.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: What happened? Somebody step on your
hands?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Yeah. Big creep. Broke my thumbs.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Man named Turk Baker?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You know everybody, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Everybody who can hurt me, everybody who can
help me. It pays.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Maybe you oughta give me lessons.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Sign up.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Where do I sign?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: The first match I got in mind for you is in
Louisville, Kentucky.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You name the place, boss. I’ll be there.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: What happened to you anyway?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Like I told ya. My thumbs.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: No, I don’t mean the thumbs. You already told
me about the thumbs.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I been thinking.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Thinking about what?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Maybe I’m not such a high-class piece of
property right now. And a twenty- five per cent slice of something big
is better than a hundred per cent slice of nothin’.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Hey, get us a couple of drinks here, will ya?
J. T. S. Brown.</p>
<p><strong>headwaiter</strong>: Good evening, sir.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Good evening. Give use a nice, quiet
table.</p>
<p><strong>headwaiter</strong>: Yes, sir. Right this way.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Would you like a drink before dinner,
sir?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Hey?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Sherry. Very old, very dry.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Two. Sherry?… Nice joint. You look very
pretty.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I feel pretty.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Well, what’s so funny?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Your tie. I never saw you wear one
before.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: First time for everything.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Oh. Yeah. That’s great.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: To you, Eddie.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Thank you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: What is it, Eddie?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Nothin’. Want another drink?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: What do you want to tell me?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Well, I, uh, I’ll be leaving town for a
little while.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: For how long?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Oh, I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: A week? A year?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: More like a week. Look, I’ll be back.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Sure. Let’s go home.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Taxi.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: No, I want to walk.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Come here. Come on, now.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You better get some dry things on.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Don’t you want to know where I’m going?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: No. Yes, I want to know what for. But I don’t
want to ask.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I’m going to Kentucky. To Louisville. With a
friend. Try to make some money. I need it, the money. I’ll be leaving
early in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Leave now.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Oh, grow up.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Why should I?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Sarah, I’m going to Kentucky to play pool,
with a guy by the name of Findley. Now, I need the action and I need the
money. I told you I’d be back.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: If you were going to come back you wouldn’t
have taken me out tonight. You wouldn’t have bought this dress. You’re
hustling me, Eddie. You’ve never stopped hustling me.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Now, I never hustled you. Even when I thought
I was. You know it.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: What do you want me to do? Just sit here and
wait? Faithful little Sarah. Pull the shades down and sit. When you feel
like coming back, you’ll come back. And you’ll love me. And then you’ll
go away again. Is that your idea of love?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I got no idea of love. And neither have you.
I mean, neither one of us would know what it was if we saw it coming
down the street.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I’d know it, Eddie. I’d know. For God’s
sakes, what are you trying to do to me? I love you.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Well, what’s your idea of love? Chains?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: No. I made you up, didn’t I, Eddie? You
weren’t real. I made you up, like everything else. There was no car
crash, Eddie. When I was five, I had polio. I was never an actress. The
rich old man is my father. He walked out on us when I was seven. He
sends me a check every month. That’s how he buys his way out of my life.
The men I’ve known… after they left, I’d say they weren’t real, I made
them up. But you, Eddie. I wanted you to be real.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I’m so scared, Eddie… I’m scared.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Sarah Packard… Bert Gordon.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Miss Packard. How do you do?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: That brown one’s mine. It goes in drawing room
A, huh? Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I got it, I got it.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: You sure you going to be comfortable enough
there, Miss… ah… ?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Packard. Sarah Packard.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: It always takes me a little while to get a
name fixed in my mind. Are you sure you don’t want anything?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: No, I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: You, uh, you ever been to Louisville during
Derby week, Miss, ah, Packard?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I’ve never been to Louisville.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Lots of action. Lots of money. Lots of class.
You’ll see some of the best-dressed and most beautiful women in the
world at the races. Knock your eye out.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: James Findley is a very rich man. Grandfather
left him twenty per cent of a tobacco company.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What? And he – he hustles pool?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: He’s a gentleman. Gentleman gambler. He gets
his kicks playing with hustlers. He’s got an old Southern mansion with a
pool table in the basement, drinks eight-year-old bourbon, smokes
cork-tipped cigarettes.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: How good is he?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: I don’t know. Never saw him play. They say
he’s one of the best.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I’m ready.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Soon as I finish my coffee.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You must have a lot of confidence in me.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: I don’t. But I got confidence in Findley.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What’s that supposed to mean?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Means I got confidence that he’s a loser. All
the way a loser. You happen to be about only one-half loser – the other
half, winner. I’m finished.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Here, I got it.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: No, no. When you play for me, I pick up all
the tabs.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Fats knew the game was in the clutch, knew he
had to do something to stop ya. He played it smart.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I played that game, Bert. In my head I played
it a thousand times.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Play it again. Learn something. Fats went in
the john, see? Washed his face, cleaned his fingernails, made his mind a
blank, combed his hair, came back all ready to go. You were through. You
saw him, you saw how he looked. Clean, all set to start all over again.
Hold tight and push hard. You know what you were doing? You were waitin’
to get beat. Flattened out on your butt, swimmin’ around in glory. And
whisky. Probably deciding how you could lose.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: What makes you know so much? How do you know
what Eddie was thinking?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: I know. Been there myself. We’ve all been
there, haven’t we, Miss Packard?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Got a match, Eddie?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Doesn’t your lighter work, Mr. Gordon?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Oh, I forgot all about it. How’s the
hands?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Good. I’d hate to think I was putting my money
on a cripple.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Hey, whaddya say something like that for?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: It’s all right, Eddie. I’m sure Mr. Gordon
meant no offense. It was a figure of speech.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: That’s right, Miss Packard.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: And a fact is a fact.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: She’s a smart girl, Eddie.</p>
<p><strong>bellhop</strong>: Right this way, Mr. Gordon.</p>
<p><strong>bellhop</strong>: Here you are, Mr. Gordon.</p>
<p><strong>concierge</strong>: Suite fifty-six.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Look, I-I wired ahead for two suites
adjoining.</p>
<p><strong>concierge</strong>: I don’t recall.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Well, I do. I want two suites.</p>
<p><strong>concierge</strong>: Well, I’m sorry, Mr. Gordon. We’re filled
up. This is Derby week.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Look, son, you’ve got it all wrong. You must
have gotten my wire. Look through your reservations, huh?</p>
<p><strong>concierge</strong>: I’ll see what I can do… You were right,
Mr. Gordon. I mislaid your wire. Uh, two adjoining suites?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You know, that’s real sweet music in there.
You can almost smell the action and the money. You know, I can feel it
right down in the bottom of my shoes.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Come on, let’s go…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Eddie!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Hey, Billy, how are ya?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Fast Eddie. I didn’t know you were here.
Everybody’s here. It’s like a hustler’s convention. The Whetstone Kid,
Johnny Jumbo. C’mon in. The guys’ll be glad to see you. C’mon.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What room are you in?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Fifty-seven.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I’ll be up later.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Oh, wait a minute, Miss Packard.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: We’re neighbors now. You can call me
Sarah.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: I want to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Do we need words?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Yeah, I think we do. We could try to cut each
other up. But that would be bad for everybody. Bad for me, bad for you.
And worst of all, be bad for Eddie.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You know what’s good for him?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: To win.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: For whom and for what?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: For what makes the world go round. For money,
and for glory.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You didn’t answer my first question. For
whom?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: All right. Today for me, tomorrow for
himself.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: No, there’s no tomorrow. Not with you. You
own all the tomorrows because you buy them today, and you buy cheap.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Well, nobody has to sell.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You bastard.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Listen, Miss Ladybird, you’re here on a rain
check and I know it. You’re hanging on by your nails. You let that glory
whistle blow loud and clear for Eddie and you’re a wreck on a railroad
track. You’re a horse that finished last. So don’t make trouble, Miss
Ladybird. Live and let live. While you can.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: I’ll make it up to you.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: You tell me.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Where’s Bert?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: He went off someplace.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Well, that old lovin’ horse paid twenty-two
forty. Let’s see… two hundred I won from the jockey last night. And
today at the track… I got five hundred and forty bucks. Here, you hold
it.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Just for luck.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Hey, Findley’s here.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Over there by the bar.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Aren’t you gonna go over and talk to him?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Nah. Sit tight. He’ll be over here.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Are you ready for another?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: No, no more for me.</p>
<p><strong>findley</strong>: Well, hello. Haven’t seen you in a long
time.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Well, hello. Haven’t been here for a long
time. Ah, Miss Packard, Eddie Felson… James…</p>
<p><strong>findley</strong>: Findley.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Glad to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>findley</strong>: And I you. I think I’ve heard about you,
Mr. Felson. You play pocket billiards, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Now and then. Why, do you?</p>
<p><strong>findley</strong>: A little, although I’m afraid I generally
lose.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: So does Eddie.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Well, I win sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>findley</strong>: I’ll bet you do, Mr. Felson. I’ll just bet
you do.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>findley</strong>: Bert, I believe Mr. Felson’s making a
proposition.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Could be.</p>
<p><strong>findley</strong>: Well, Mr. Felson, maybe you could come out
to my place some evening. We could play a few games of billiards.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>findley</strong>: You’re very direct, Mr. Felson.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: That’s right. When?</p>
<p><strong>findley</strong>: Would you like to come out tonight?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What time?</p>
<p><strong>findley</strong>: I’m having some people over for drinks
right after the races. Why don’t you all come over? Then about nine, ten
o’clock we can play.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: We’ll be there.</p>
<p><strong>findley</strong>: Good, good.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: If you don’t mind I think I’ll stay at the
hotel.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Well, what’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I’m a little tired.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: C’mon, there’ll be a lot of laughs. Findley’s
parties are famous. He invites everybody from top to bottom, from high
society to every tout, hustler, and tramp in town. That’s another way he
has of gettin’ his kicks. It excites him to be around what he calls the
criminal type. Some men are like that. Some women too.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What’s the matter? What happened?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: It’s all right. She had a little too much to
drink, that’s all. Forget it. Go upstairs and sleep it off.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Hey, c’mon. Cut it out! Do what he says. Come
on upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>findley</strong>: You gentlemen care for a drink?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: No, none for me. Come on, let’s play.</p>
<p><strong>findley</strong>: By all means.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I thought we came here to play pool.</p>
<p><strong>findley</strong>: I don’t play pool, Mr. Felson. I play
billiards. My house, my game. You don’t have to play if you don’t want
to.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Well, we won’t.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: C’mon, Bert. Let me play him.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>findley</strong>: Oh, we’ll start small… a hundred dollars a
game.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: You ever played billiards before?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: You hustlin’ me?</p>
<p><strong>findley</strong>: I’m sure Mr. Felson knows what he’s doing.
Certainly you can afford a hundred dollars to find out.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Deal the cards.</p>
<p><strong>findley</strong>: Beautiful shot, Felson. Beautiful. You’ve
played billiards before, Mr. Felson. Ah, you gentlemen sure you don’t
care for a drink?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Oh no, nothing for me.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: How do we stand?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: ’Bout even.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: When do I raise the bet?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Bert, if that’s his best game, I can beat
him.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Level with me, Eddie. You ever play billiards
before?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What’s the difference? You got a pool cue,
balls on the table. All you gotta do is get the feel of it.</p>
<p><strong>findley</strong>: Like to raise the stakes, Mr. Felson?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Okay?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>findley</strong>: Oh, about five hundred.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Do you really think you can beat him?</p>
<p><strong>findley</strong>: Of course he thinks he can beat me, Bert.
He wouldn’t be playing me if he didn’t. Right, Felson?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: I didn’t ask him can he beat you. I already
know he can beat you. I asked him will he? With Eddie, that’s two
different things.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I can beat him.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: All right. Five hundred.</p>
<p><strong>findley</strong>: Have you noticed, Bert? This fellow here
bears a striking resemblance to you. It seems as though you might have
modeled for the artist.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: It’s possible.</p>
<p><strong>findley</strong>: Mark that one up too, Bert.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I’ll beat him the next game.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: How’re the hands?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: They’re fine.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Well, rack up your cue. We’re leavin’.</p>
<p><strong>findley</strong>: That seems a shame. The night is young.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: The night is two thousand dollars old.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Hey, Bert. Wait a minute!</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: I said we’re leavin’.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I can beat him, Bert. Now he suckered me
’cause he knows how to hustle. I didn’t think he did. But I can outplay
him. I can beat him.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: I don’t believe you, Eddie. I think you’re
still a loser.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: All right, then. I’ll play him with my own
money.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Okay, c’mon. Let’s play.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: There it is. I’m broke.</p>
<p><strong>findley</strong>: Ah, that’s unfortunate, Mr. Felson.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: For who, Mr. Findley? …Bert, he only beat me
by one point. Now, you can’t get off me now.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: The bank is closed.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Please don’t get off me now.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: I know when to quit. You don’t. Win or lose,
you don’t know when to quit.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What do you want me to do, huh? What do you
want me to do? Just say it and you got it but PLEASE don’t get off me
now.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Don’t beg him, Eddie.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Go on back to the hotel.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Please, Eddie, don’t beg him.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Would you go on back to the hotel? Take a
cab, go on back to the hotel.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Doesn’t all of this come through to you,
Eddie? Doesn’t any of this mean anything to you? That man, this place,
the people. They wear masks, Eddie. And underneath the masks they’re
perverted, twisted, crippled.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Don’t wear a mask, Eddie. You don’t have to.
That’s Turk, Eddie, the man who broke your thumbs. Only he’s not going
to break your thumbs. He’ll break your heart, your guts. And for the
same reason – ’cause he hates you, ’cause of what you are. ’Cause of
what you have and he hasn’t.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Would you get off my back, Sarah? Once and
for all, will you get out, will you GET OFF MY BACK?!</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Go ahead and play him, Eddie. Play him for a
thousand dollars a game.</p>
<p><strong>findley</strong>: Will you take a check, Bert?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Cash.</p>
<p><strong>findley</strong>: How much do I owe you?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Twelve thousand.</p>
<p><strong>findley</strong>: Here. Been an interestin’ evening.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Yeah, sure has.</p>
<p><strong>findley</strong>: Charles, will you call a cab for these
gentlemen, please. I’d show you to the door, but I…</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Oh yeah, yeah. You’re tired. And beat.</p>
<p><strong>findley</strong>: Yeah. You must come again.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Yeah. Sure.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: There’s your share. Three thousand.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: The cab’s waiting.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Oh, yeah. Here. Thanks… C’mon, Eddie, let’s
go.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I wanna walk.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: It’s a long walk.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I got time, Bert.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: You want me to tell her for you?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Tell her what?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: You gotta be hard, Eddie.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: When are you leaving?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: In a little while. That’s what you want,
isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: It’s what Eddie wants. He, uh, told me to give
you some money.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Put it on the bed. That’s the way it’s done,
isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: That’s the way it’s done.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: And the way you’re looking at me, is that the
way you look at a man you’ve just beaten? As if you’d just taken his
money, and now all you want is… his pride?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: All I want’s the money.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Sure, sure, just the money, and the
aristocratic pleasure of seeing him fall apart. You’re a Roman, Bert.
You have to win them all.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You got a drink?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Give me my key, please. Room fifty-
seven.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Well, c’mon, give me my key.</p>
<p><strong>plainclothesman</strong>: Now, let’s go over this again. You
say you were in the other room…</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: No, she closed the door. I told you she closed
the door. I was in the other room. She closed the door, went in there,
maybe, I don’t know, ten minutes, five minutes…</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Hey. Let him come in, huh?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Eddie?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Eddie?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Eddie? She come in here, Eddie. She asked me
for a drink. I give her one. We had a few more.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Eddie, she came in here.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I came to play pool, Fats.</p>
<p><strong>fats</strong>: That’s good, Eddie. For how much?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You name it.</p>
<p><strong>fats</strong>: Thousand dollars a game.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Let’s make it three thousand dollars a game,
Fats. C’mon, three thousand dollars. That’s my bankroll, my life’s
savings. What’s the matter, Fats? All you gotta do is beat me the first
game and I’m on my way back to Oakland.</p>
<p><strong>fats</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Get on me, Bert. I can’t lose.</p>
<p><strong>fats</strong>: Willie.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Call it.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Heads.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: How shall I play that one, Bert? Play it
safe? That’s the way you always told me to play it, safe, play the
percentage. Well, here we go… fast and loose.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: One ball, corner pocket. Yeah, percentage
players die broke too, don’t they, Bert?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: How can I lose? Twelve ball. I mean, how can
I lose? Because you were right, Bert. I mean, it’s not enough that you
just have talent. You gotta have character too. Four ball. Yeah and I
sure got character now. I picked it up in a hotel room in
Louisville.</p>
<p><strong>fats</strong>: Shoot pool, Fast Eddie.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I’m shootin’ pool, Fats. When I miss you can
shoot.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Five ball. …Fourteen ball. …Four ball.</p>
<p><strong>a voice</strong>: That’s game.</p>
<p><strong>fats</strong>: Eight ball.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Thirteen ball.</p>
<p><strong>fats</strong>: I quit, Eddie. I can’t beat you. Willie, give
him the stakes. You got yourself a pool player.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Preacher, gimme my coat, will ya?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Where do you think you’re going?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Eddie?… YOU OWE ME MONEY!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: And just how do you figure that, Bert? What
do you figure I owe you?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Half.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: In Louisville it was seventy-five per
cent.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Well, here it’s half.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What if I don’t pay ya, Bert?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: You don’t pay me? You gonna get your thumbs
broken. And your fingers. And if I want them to, your right arm in three
or four places.</p>
<p><strong>fats</strong>: Better pay him, Eddie.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: So you figure you’re still my manager,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: I’m a businessman, kid.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Well, you got a lot of games lined up for
me?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Yeah, we’re gonna make a lotta money together,
from now on.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Fifty per cent?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: No, it don’t have to be fifty. It can be
thirty… twenty-five.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: We really stuck the knife in her, didn’t we,
Bert?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Aaaahhhh!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Boy, we really gave it to her good.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: If it didn’t happen in Louisville, it’d
happened someplace else. If it didn’t happen now, it’d happen six months
from now. That’s the kinda dame she was.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: And we twisted it, didn’t we, Bert? Course,
maybe that doesn’t stick in your throat cause you spit it out just like
you spit out everything else. But it sticks in mine. I loved her, Bert.
I traded her in on a pool game. But that wouldn’t mean anything to you.
Because who did you ever care about? Just win, win, you said, win,
that’s the important thing. You don’t know what winnin’ is, Bert. You’re
a loser. ’Cause you’re dead inside, and you can’t live unless you make
everything else dead around ya.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Too high, Bert. Price is too high. Because if
I take it, she never lived, she never died. And we both know that’s not
true, Bert, don’t we, huh? She lived, she died. Boy, you better… You
tell your boys they better kill me, Bert. They better go all the way
with me. Because if they just bust me up, I’ll put all those pieces back
together again, and so help me, so help me God, Bert… I’m gonna come
back here and I’m gonna kill you.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: All right… All right.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Only, uh, don’t ever walk into a big- time
pool hall again.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Fat man…</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: …you shoot a great game of pool.</p>
<p><strong>fats</strong>: So do you, Fast Eddie.</p>
