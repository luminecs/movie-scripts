<p><strong>everett</strong>: Say, uh, any a you boys smithies?</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Or, if not smithies per se, were you
otherwise trained in the metallurgic arts before straitened
circumstances forced you into a life of aimless wanderin’?</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Jesus - can’t I count on you people?</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: Sorry, Everett.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: All right - if we take off through that
bayou-</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Wait a minute! Who elected you leader a this
outfit?</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Well, Pete, I just figured it should be the
one with capacity for abstract thought. But if that ain’t the consensus
view, hell, let’s put her to a vote!</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Suits me! I’m votin’ for yours truly!</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Well I’m votin’ for yours truly too!</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: Okay - I’m with you fellas.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Mind if we join you, ol’ timer?</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Join me, my sons.</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: You work for the railroad, grandpa?</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: I work for no man.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Got a name, do ya?</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: I have no name.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Well, that right there may be why you’ve
had difficulty finding gainful employment. Ya see, in the mart of
competitive commerce, the-</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: You seek a great fortune, you three who are
now in chains…</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: And you will find a fortune - though it
will not be the fortune you seek…</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: …But first, first you must travel a long
and difficult road - a road fraught with peril, uh-huh, and pregnant
with adventure. You shall see things wonderful to tell. You shall see a
cow on the roof of a cottonhouse, uh-huh, and oh, so many
startlements…</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: …I cannot say how long this road shall be.
But fear not the obstacles in your path, for Fate has vouchsafed your
reward. And though the road may wind, and yea, your hearts grow weary,
still shall ye foller the way, even unto your salvation.</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: How’d he know about the treasure?</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Don’t know, Delmar-though the blind are
reputed to possess sensitivities compensatin’ for their lack of sight,
even to the point of developing para- normal psychic powers. Now
clearly, seein’ the future would fall neatly into that ka-taggery. It’s
not so surprising, then, if an organism deprived of earthly vision-</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: He said we wouldn’t get it! He said we
wouldn’t get the treasure we seek!</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Well what does he know - he’s an ignorant
old man! Jesus, Pete, I’m telling you I buried it myself, and if your
cousin still runs this-here horse farm and has a forge and some shoein’
impediments to restore our liberty of movement-</p>
<p><strong>child’s voice</strong>: Hold it rah chair!</p>
<p><strong>child</strong>: You men from the bank?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: You Wash’s boy?</p>
<p><strong>child</strong>: Yassir! And Daddy tolt me I’m to shoot
whosoever from the bank!</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: Well, we ain’t from no bank, young
feller.</p>
<p><strong>child</strong>: Yassir! I’m also suppose to shoot folks
servin’ papers!</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: Well we ain’t got no papers.</p>
<p><strong>child</strong>: Yassir! I nicked the census man!</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: There’s a good boy. Is your daddy about?</p>
<p><strong>wash</strong>: ’Lo, Pete. Hooor yer friends?</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Pleased to make your acquaintance, Mister
Hogwallop. M’name’s Ulysses Everett McGill.</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: ’N I’m Delmar O’Donnell.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: How ya been, Wash? Been what, twelve, thirteen
year’n?</p>
<p><strong>wash</strong>: You’ve grown chatty.</p>
<p><strong>wash</strong>: I expect you’ll want them chains knocked
off.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: And Uncle Ratliff?</p>
<p><strong>wash</strong>: The anthrax took most of his cows. The rest
don’t milk, and he lost a boy to mumps.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Where’s Cora, Cousin Wash?</p>
<p><strong>wash</strong>: Couldn’t say. Mrs. Hogwallop up and</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Mm. Must’ve been lookin’ for answers.</p>
<p><strong>wash</strong>: Possibly. Good riddance, far as I’m
concerned…</p>
<p><strong>wash</strong>: I do miss her cookin’ though.</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: This stew’s awful good.</p>
<p><strong>wash</strong>: Think so?</p>
<p><strong>wash</strong>: I slaughtered this horse last Tuesday; ‘m
afraid she’s startin’ to turn.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Well, that’s the last number for
tonight’s ‘Pass the Biscuits Pappy O’Daniel Flour Hour.’ This is Pappy
O’Daniel, hopin’ you folks been enjoyin’ that good old-timey music, and
remember, when you’re fixin’ to fry up some flapjacks or bake a mess a
biscuits, use cool clear water and good pure Pappy O’Daniel flour for
that ‘Pass the Biscuits, Pappy’ flavor. So tune in next week folks, and
till then whyncha turn to your better half and sing along with Pappy:
‘You are my sunshine, my only sunshine…’</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Well, guess I’ll be turning in…</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Say, Cousin Wash, I guess it’d be the acme
of foolishness to inquire if you had a hairnet.</p>
<p><strong>wash</strong>: Got a bunch in yon byurra. Mrs. Hogwallop’s,
matter of fact. Hepyaseff; I won’t be needin’ ’em.</p>
<p><strong>bullhorn voice</strong>: All right boys, itsy
authorities.</p>
<p><strong>bullhorn voice</strong>: We gotcha surrounded. Just come on
out grabbin’ air!</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Damn! We’re in a tight spot!</p>
<p><strong>man with bullhorn</strong>: And don’t try nothin’ fancy -
your sitchy-ation is purt nigh hopeless.</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: What inna Sam Hill…?</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Pete’s cousin turned us in for the
bounty!</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: The hell you say! Wash is kin!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Sorry Pete! I know we’re kin! But they got
this Depression on, and I gotta do fer me and mine!</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Damn! We’re in a tight spot!</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Damn his eyes! Pa always said never trust a
Hogwallop-COME’N GET US,</p>
<p><strong>bullhorn voice</strong>: So be it! You boys’re leavin’ us no
choice but to smoke you out.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Oh no! Lord have mercy!</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: What do we do now, Everett?</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Fire! I hate fire!</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: Yeah, let’s negotiate ’em, Everett.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Now hold on, Pete, we gotta speak with one
voice here - CAREFUL WITH</p>
<p><strong>bullhorn voice</strong>: You choose it, boys - the prison
farm or the pearly gates!</p>
<p><strong>man with bullhorn</strong>: Holy Saint Christopher - OUTA
THAT</p>
<p><strong>man with bullhorn</strong>: Take cover, boys, THAT AIN’T
POPCORN!</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: Who’s that?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Come on, boys! I’m gonna R-U-N-N-O-F-</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: You should be in bed, little fella.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: You ain’t the boss a me!</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: You candy-butted car-thievin’ so’s ’n so’s! I
curse yer names!</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Go back home’n mind yer pa!</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: What’s the damn problem?</p>
<p><strong>proprietor</strong>: I can get the part from Bristol; it’ll
take two weeks. Here’s your pomade.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Two weeks! That don’t do me no good!</p>
<p><strong>proprietor</strong>: Nearest Ford auto man’s Bristol.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Hold on there - I don’t want this pomade, I
want Dapper Dan.</p>
<p><strong>proprietor</strong>: I don’t carry Dapper Dan. I carry
Fop.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: No! I don’t want Fop! Goddamnit - I use
Dapper Dan!</p>
<p><strong>proprietor</strong>: Watch your language, young fellow, this
is a public market. Now, if you want Dapper Dan I can order it for you,
have it in a couple of weeks.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Well, ain’t this place a geographical
oddity-two weeks from everywhere! Forget it! Just the dozen
hairnets!</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: It didn’t look like a one-horse town…</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: …but try getting a decent hair jelly.</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: Gopher, Everett?</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: And no transmission belt for two weeks
neither.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Huh?! They dam that river on the 21st. Today’s
the 17th!</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Don’t I know it.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: We got but four days to get to that treasure!
After that, it’ll be at the bottom of a lake!</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: We ain’t gonna make it walkin’.</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: Gopher, Everett?</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Well, you’re right there, but the ol’
tactician’s already got a plan-</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: -for the transportation, that is; I don’t
know how I’m gonna keep my coiffure in order.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: How’s this a plan? How’re we gonna get a
car?</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Sell that. I figured it could only have
painful associations for Wash.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: To Washington Bartholomew Hogwallop. From his
loving Cora. Ay-More Fie- dellis.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: It was in his bureau.</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: You got light fingers, Everett. Gopher?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: You mis’able little sneak thief…</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: You stole from my kin!</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Who was fixing to betray us!</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: You didn’t know that at the time!</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: So I borrowed it till I did know!</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: That don’t make no sense!</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Pete, it’s a fool looks for logic in the
chambers of the human heart. What the hell’s that singing?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Oh Brothers, let’s go down, come on down,
don’t you wanna go down…</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: Oh Brothers, let’s go down, down to the
river to pray…</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: Appears to be… some kinda… con- gur-gation.
Care for some gopher?</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: No, thank you Delmar - a third of a gopher
would only rouse my appetite without beddin’ her back down.</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: You can have the whole thing - me’n Pete
already had one…</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: Oh, sisters, let’s go down, come on down,
don’t you want to go down…</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: We ran acrost a gopher village…</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Come with us, brothers! Join us and be
saved!</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: We went down to the river one day, Studying
about that good old way, And who shall wear that robe and crown, Oh
Lord, show us the way…</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: I guess hard times flush the chumps.
Everybody’s lookin’ for answers, and there’s always-</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Where the hell’s he goin’?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Well, I’ll be a sonofabitch. Delmar’s been
saved!</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Pete, don’t be ignorant-</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: Well that’s it boys, I been redeemed! The
preacher warshed away all my sins and transgressions. It’s the
straight-and-narrow from here on out and heaven everlasting’s my
reward!</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Delmar what the hell are you talking about?
- We got bigger fish to fry-</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: Preacher said my sins are warshed away,
including that Piggly Wiggly I knocked over in Yazoo!</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: I thought you said you were innocent a
those charges.</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: Well I was lyin’ - and I’m proud to say that
that sin’s been warshed away too! Neither God nor man’s got nothin’ on
me now! Come on in, boys, the water’s fine!</p>
<p><strong>a voice</strong>: All tight, boys! We got the scent!</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: The preacher said it absolved us.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: For him, not for the law! I’m surprised at
you, Pete. Hell, I gave you credit for more brains than Delmar.</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: But there were witnesses, saw us
redeemed!</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: That’s not the issue, Delmar. Even if it
did put you square with the Lord, the State of Mississippi is more
hardnosed.</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: You should a joined us, Everett. It couldn’t
a hurt none.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Hell, at least it woulda washed away the stink
of that pomade.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Join you two ignorant fools in a ridiculous
superstition? Thank you anyway. And I like the smell of my hair
treatment - the pleasing odor is half the point.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Baptism. You two are just dumber’n a bag of
hammers. Well, I guess you’re my cross to bear-</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: Pull over, Everett - let’s give that colored
boy a lift.</p>
<p><strong>hitchhiker</strong>: You folks goin’ through Tishamingo?</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: Sure, hop in.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: How ya doin’, boy? Name’s Everett, and
these two soggy sonsabitches are Pete and Delmar. Keep your fingers away
from Pete’s mouth-he ain’t had nothin’ to eat for the last thirteen
years but prison food, gopher, and a little greasy horse.</p>
<p><strong>hitchhiker</strong>: Thank you fuh the lif’, suh. M’names
Tommy. Tommy Johnson.</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: How ya doin’, Tommy. I haven’t seen a house
in miles. What’re you doin’ out in the middle of nowhere?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I had to be at that crossroads las’ midnight
to sell mah soul to the devil.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Well ain’t it a small world, spiritually
speakin’! Pete and Delmar just been baptized and saved! I guess I’m the
only one here who remains unaffiliated!</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: This ain’t no laughin’ matter, Everett.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: What’d the devil give you for your soul,
Tommy?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: He taught me to play this guitar real
good.</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: Oh, son! For that you traded your
everlastin’ soul?!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I wudden usin’ it.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: I always wondered-what’s the devil look
like?</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Well, of course there’s all manner of
lesser imps’n demons, Pete, but the Great Satan hisself is red and scaly
with a bifurcated tail and carries a hayfork.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Oh no! No suh! He’s white-white as you folks,
with mirrors for eyes an’ a big hollow voice an’ allus travels with a
mean old hound.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: And he told you to go to Tishamingo?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: No suh, that was mah idea. I heard they’s a
man there pays folks money to sing into a can. They say he pays extra
effen you play real good.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: How much does he pay?</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: All right boys, just follow my lead.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Who’s the honcho around here?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I am. Hur you?</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Well sir, my name is Jordan Rivers and
these here are the Soggy Bottom Boys outta Cottonelia Mississippi- Songs
of Salvation to Salve the Soul. We hear you pay good money to sing into
a can.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Well that all depends. You boys do Negro
songs?</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Sir, we are Negroes. All except our a-cump-
uh, company-accompluh- uh, the fella that plays the gui-tar.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Well, I don’t record Negro songs. I’m lookin’
for some ol’-timey material. Why, people just can’t get enough of it
since we started broadcastin’ the ‘Pappy O’Daniel Flour Hour’, so thanks
for stoppin’ by, but-</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Sir, the Soggy Bottom Boys been steeped in
ol’-timey material. Heck, you’re silly with it, aintcha boys?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: That’s right!</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: That’s right! We ain’t really Negroes!</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: All except fer our a-cump-uh-nust!</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Hot damn, boy, I almost believe you did
sell your soul to the devil!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Boys, that was some mighty fine pickin’ and
singin’. You just sign these papers and I’ll give you ten dollars
apiece.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Okay sir, but Mert and Aloysius’ll have to
scratch Xes - only four of us can write.</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: Hey mister! I don’t mean to be tellin’ tales
out a school, but there’s a man in there hands out ten dollars to anyone
sings into his can!</p>
<p><strong>pappy</strong>: I’m not here to make a record, ya dumb
cracker, they broadcast me out on the radio.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: That’s Governor Menelaus ‘Pass the Biscuits,
Pappy’ O’Daniel, and he’d sure ’preciate it if you ate his farina and
voted him a second term.</p>
<p><strong>eckard</strong>: Finest governor we’ve ever had in
M’sippi.</p>
<p><strong>spivey</strong>: In any state.</p>
<p><strong>eckard</strong>: Oh Lord yes, any parish’r precinct; I was
makin’ the larger point.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: Aintcha gonna press the flesh, Pappy, do a
little politickin’?</p>
<p><strong>pappy</strong>: I’ll press your flesh, you dimwitted
sonofabitch - you don’t tell your pappy how to cawt the elect ’rate!</p>
<p><strong>pappy</strong>: We ain’t one-at-a-timin’ here, we mass
communicatin’!</p>
<p><strong>eckard</strong>: Oh, yes, assa parful new force.</p>
<p><strong>spivey</strong>: Mm-mm.</p>
<p><strong>pappy</strong>: Shake a leg, Junior! Thank God your mama died
givin’ birth-if she’d a seen ya she’d a died of shame…</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: Why don’t we bed down out here tonight?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Yeah, it stinks in that ol’ barn.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Suits me…</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Pretty soon it’ll be nothin’ but feather
beds’n silk sheets.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: A million dollars.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Million point two.</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: Five… hunnert… thousand… each.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Four hundred, Delmar.</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: Izzat right?</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: What’re you gonna do with your share of the
treasure, Pete?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Go out west somewhere, open a fine restaurant.
I’m gonna be the maider dee. Greet all the swells, go to work ever’ day
in a bowtie and tuxedo, an’ all the staff’ll all say Yassir and Nawsir
and in a Jiffy Pete…</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: An’ all my meals for free…</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: What about you, Delmar? What’re you gonna
do with your share a that dough?</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: Visit those foreclosin’ sonofaguns down at
the Indianola Savings and Loan and slap that cash down on the barrelhead
and buy back the family farm. Hell, you ain’t no kind of man if you
ain’t got land.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: What about you, Everett? What’d you have in
mind when you stoled it in the first place?</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Me? Oh, I didn’t have no plan. Still don’t,
really.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Well that hardly sounds like you…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: All right, boys, itsy authorities!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Your sitchy-ation is purt nigh hopeless!</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Damn! They found our car!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: We ain’t got the time-and nary inclination-to
gentle you boys no further!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: It’s either the penal farm or the fires of
damnation-makes no nevermind to me!</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: Damn! We gotta skedaddle!</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: I left my pomade in that car! Maybe I can
creep up!</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: Don’t be a fool, Everett, we gotta R-
U-N-O-F-F-T, but pronto!</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Where’s Tommy?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Already lit out, scared out of his wits. Let’s
go!</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: The hell it ain’t square one! Ain’t no one
gonna pick up three filthy unshaved hitchhikers, and one of ’em a
know-it-all that can’t keep his trap shut!</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Pete, the personal rancor reflected in that
remark I don’t intend to dignify with comment, but I would like to
address your general attitude of hopeless negativism. Consider the
lilies a the goddamn field, or-hell!- take a look at Delmar here as your
paradigm a hope.</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: Yeah, look at me.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Now you may call it an unreasoning
optimism. You may call it obtuse. But the plain fact is we still have…
close to… close to…</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: …close to… three days… before they dam that
river…</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Is this the road to Itta Bena?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Uh… Itta Bena…</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Itta Bena, now, uh, that would be…</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Isn’t it, uh…</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: I’m thinkin’ it’s uh, you could take this
road to, uh…</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: …Nah, that ain’t right… I’m thinkin’ of…</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: …I believe, unless I’m very much mistaken -
see, we’ve been away for several years, uh…</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Hop on in while you give it a think.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Any a you boys know your way around a
Walther PPK?</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: Well now, that’s where we cain’t help ya. I
don’t believe it’s in Mississippi.</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: Friend, some of your folding money has come
unstowed.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Just stuff it down that sack there. You boys
aren’t badmen, I take it?</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: Well, funny you should ask-I was bad, till
yesterday, but me’n Pete here been saved. My name’s Delmar, and that
there’s Everett.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: George Nelson. It’s a pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>nelson</strong>: Grab the tiller, will ya buddy?</p>
<p><strong>nelson</strong>: Hand up that Thompson, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: Say, what line of work are you in,
George?</p>
<p><strong>nelson</strong>: …cows…</p>
<p><strong>nelson</strong>: I hate cows worse than coppers!</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: Aww, George, not the livestock.</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: He’s a live wire though, ain’t he?</p>
<p><strong>nelson</strong>: Thanky dear! All the money in the bag, and
you can tell your grandkids you were done by the best! I’M GEORGE</p>
<p><strong>nelson</strong>: It’s a kick and a quarter, ain’t it
boys?</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Pardon me, George, but have you got a plan
for gettin’ outa here?</p>
<p><strong>nelson</strong>: Sure boys, here’s m’plan!</p>
<p><strong>nelson</strong>: They ain’t never seen ordnance like this!
WELL, THANK YOU, FOLKS, AND</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: …it’s Babyface Nelson…</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: They didn’t mean anything by it, George.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: You gotta be a little tolerant, George; all
these poor folk know is the legend. Hell, they can’t be expected to
appreciate the complex individual underneath-</p>
<p><strong>nelson</strong>: Aww, I’m all right-</p>
<p><strong>nelson</strong>: This’ll put me right back on top!</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: Damn but that was some fun though, won it
George?!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: …yeah…</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: Almost makes me wish I hadn’t been saved!
Jackin’ up banks - I can see how a fella could derive a lot a pleasure
and satisfaction out of it!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: …it’s okay…</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: Whoa doggies!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: …Well, I’m takin’ off.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You boys can have the automobile.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: ’N might as well take my share a the
riches.</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: What the - where you goin’, George?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: …I dunno… who cares…</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: Now wuddya suppose is eatin’ George?</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Well ya know, Delmar, they say that with a
thrill-seekin’ personality, what goes up must come down. Top of the
world one minute, haunted by megrims the next. Yep, it’s like our friend
George is a alley cat and his own damn humors’re swingin’ him by the
tail. But don’t worry, Delmar; he’ll be back on top again. I don’t think
we’ve heard the last of George Nelson.</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: Damn! I liked George.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Don’t be saps for Pappy; vote for Stokes and
responsible gummint!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: He’s against the Innarests and for the little
man!</p>
<p><strong>midget</strong>: Greetings, brother! Vote for Stokes!</p>
<p><strong>midget</strong>: Clean gummint is yours for the askin’!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Hang on! Lemme slap up a wire.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Folks, here’s my cousin Ezzard’s niece Eudora
from out Greenwood doin’ a little number with her cousin Tom- Tom which
I predict you’re just gonna enjoy thoroughly.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Now what can I do you for, Mister French?</p>
<p><strong>french</strong>: How can I lay hold a the Soggy Bottom
Boys?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Soggy Bottom Boys - I don’t precisely
recollect, uh -</p>
<p><strong>french</strong>: They cut a record in here, few days ago,
old-timey harmony thing with a guitar Accump-accump-uh-</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Oh I remember ’em, colored fellas I believe,
swell bunch a boys, sung into yon can and skedaddled.</p>
<p><strong>french</strong>: Well that record has just gone through the
goddamn roof! They’re playin’ it as far away as Mobile! The whole damn
state’s goin’ ape!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: It was a powerful air.</p>
<p><strong>french</strong>: Hot damn, we gotta find those boys! Sign ’em
to a big fat contract! Hell’s bells, Mr. Lunn, if we don’t the goddamn
competition will!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Oh mercy, yes. You gotta beat that
competition.</p>
<p><strong>sad-faced woman</strong>: Do you have the Soggy Bottom Boys
performing ‘Man of Constant Sorrow’?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: No, ma’am, we had a new shipment in yesterday
but we just can’t keep it on the shelves.</p>
<p><strong>sad-faced woman</strong>: Oh, mercy. Then - just the purple
toilet water.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: …Shutup, Delmar.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: I guess o’ Pete’s got the itch.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Howdy do, ladies. Name of Pete!</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Maybe I could help you with the, uh-</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Ahem. I, uh…</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: I don’t believe I’ve, uh, heard that song
before…</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Aintcha gonna innerduce us, Pete?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Don’t know their names. I seen ’em first!</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Ladies, you’ll have to pardon my friend
here; Pete is dirt-ignorant and unschooled in the social arts. My name
on the other hand is Ulysses Everett McGill and you ladies are about the
three prettiest water lilies it’s ever been my privilege to admire.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Why, thank you dear, that’s very, uh…</p>
<p><strong>everette</strong>: Mm. Corn licker, I guess, uh, the
preferred local uh…</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: Pleased to meet you, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Damn!</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: Holy Saint Christopher!</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Whuhh…</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: Oh sweet Lord, Everett, looka this!</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: PETE! Where the heck are ya! We ain’t got
time for your shenanigans!</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: Sweet Jesus, Everett! They left his
heart!</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: What on earth is goin’ on here! What’s got
into you, Delmar!</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: Caintcha see it Everett! Them sigh- reens
did this to Pete! They loved him up an’ turned him into a horney-
toad!</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: Pete! Come back!</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: Don’t worry, Pete! It’s me, Delmar! Oh
Everett! What’re we gonna do?!</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: …I’m not sure that’s Pete.</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: Course it’s Pete! Look at ’im!</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: We gotta find some kinda wizard can change
’im back!</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: …I’m just not sure that’s Pete.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: You can’t display a toad in a fine
restaurant like this! Why, the good folks here’d go right off their
feed!</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: I just don’t think it’s right, keepin’ him
under wraps like we’s ashamed of him.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Well if that is Pete I am ashamed of him.
The way I see it he got what he deserved - fornicating with some whore a
Babylon. These things-</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: -don’t happen for no reason, Delmar.
Obviously it’s some kind of judgment on Pete’s character.</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: The two of us was fixing to fornicate!</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Heh-heh. You’ll have to excuse my
rusticated friend here, unaccustomed as he is to city manners.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Well mamzel I guess we’ll have a couple a
steaks and some gratinated potatoes and wash it down with your finest
bubbly wine-</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: …And I don’t suppose the chef’d have any
nits or grubs in the pantry, or - naw, never mind, just bring me a
couple leafs a raw cabbage.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>big man</strong>: Don’t believe I’ve seen you boys around
here before! Allow me t’innerduce myself: name of Daniel Teague, known
in these precincts as Big Dan Teague or, to those who’re pressed for
time, Big Dan toot court.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: How d’you do, Big Dan. I’m Ulysses Everett
McGill; this is my associate Delmar O’Donnell. I sense that, like me,
you are endowed with the gift of gab.</p>
<p><strong>big dan</strong>: I flatter myself that such is the case; in
my line of work it’s plumb necessary. The one thing you don’t want is
air in the conversation.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Once again we find ourselves in agreement.
What kind of work do you do, Big Dan?</p>
<p><strong>big dan</strong>: Sales, Mr. McGill, sales! And what do I
sell? The Truth! Ever’ blessed word of it, from Genesee on down to
Revelations! That’s right, the word of God, which let me add there is
damn good money in during these days of woe and want! Folks’re lookin’
for answers and Big Dan Teague sells the only book that’s got ’em! What
do you do - you and your tongue-tied friend?</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: Uh, we uh-</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: We’re adventurers, sir, currently pursuin’
a certain opportunity but open to others as well.</p>
<p><strong>big dan</strong>: I like your style, young man, so I’m gonna
propose you a proposition. You cover my check so I don’t have to run
back up to my room, have your waitress wrap your dinner picnic- style,
and we’ll retire to more private environs where I will explain to you
how vast amounts of money can be made in the service of God Amighty.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Well, why not. If nothing else I could use
some civilized conversation.</p>
<p><strong>big dan</strong>: Don’t forget your shoebox, friend.</p>
<p><strong>pappy</strong>: Languishing! Goddamn campaign is languishing!
We need a shot inna arm! Hear me, boys? Inna goddamn ARM! Election held
tomorra, that sonofabitch Stokes would win it in a walk!</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: Well he’s the reform candidate, Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>pappy</strong>: …Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: Well people like that reform. Maybe we
should get us some.</p>
<p><strong>pappy</strong>: I’ll reform you, you soft-headed sonofabitch!
How we gonna run reform when we’re the damn incumbent!</p>
<p><strong>pappy</strong>: Zat the best idea any you boys can come up
with? REEform?! Weepin’ Jesus on the cross! Eckard, you may as well
start draftin’ my concession speech right now.</p>
<p><strong>eckard</strong>: Okay, Pappy.</p>
<p><strong>pappy</strong>: I’m just makin’ a point, you stupid
sonofabitch!</p>
<p><strong>eckard</strong>: Okay, Pappy.</p>
<p><strong>eckard</strong>: Pappy just makin’ a point here, boys.</p>
<p><strong>big dan</strong>: Thankee boys for throwin’ in that fricasee.
I’m a man a large appetite and even with lunch under my belt I was
feeling a mite peckish.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Our pleasure, Big Dan.</p>
<p><strong>big dan</strong>: And thank you as well for that
conversational hiatus; I generally refrain from speech while engaged in
gustation. There are those who attempt both at the same time but I find
it course and vulgar. Now where were we?</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: Makin’ money in the Lord’s service.</p>
<p><strong>big dan</strong>: You don’t say much friend, but when you do
it’s to the point and I salute you for it.</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: Oh, it weren’t nothin’, I-</p>
<p><strong>big dan</strong>: Yes, Bible sales. The trade is not a
complicated one; there’re but two things to learn. One bein’ where to
find your wholesaler - word of God in bulk as it were. Two bein’ how to
reckanize your customer - who’re you dealin’ with? - an exercise in
psychology so to speak.</p>
<p><strong>big dan</strong>: And it is that which I propose to give you
a lesson in right now.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: I like to think that I’m a pretty astute
observer of the human scene.</p>
<p><strong>big dan</strong>: No doubt, brother - I figured as much back
there in the restaurant. That’s why I invited you out here for this
advanced tutorial.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: …What’s goin’ on, Big Dan?</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Big Dan, what’re you doin’?</p>
<p><strong>big dan</strong>: It’s all about money, boys! Atsy answer!
Dough re mi!</p>
<p><strong>big dan</strong>: Do unto others before they do unto you!</p>
<p><strong>big dan</strong>: I’ll just take your show cards…</p>
<p><strong>big dan</strong>: …and whatever you got in the hole.</p>
<p><strong>big dan</strong>: What the…</p>
<p><strong>big dan</strong>: It’s nothin’ but a damn toad!</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: No… you don’t understand…</p>
<p><strong>big dan</strong>: Don’t you boys know these things give ya
warts?</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: Oh Lord… Pete…</p>
<p><strong>big dan</strong>: End of lesson.</p>
<p><strong>big dan</strong>: So long, boys! Hee-hee! See ya in the funny
papers!</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: Pete… Pete… Pete…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Where are they?!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Talk, you unreconstructed whelp of a whore!
Where they headed?</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: Your screams ain’t gonna save your
flesh! Only your tongue is, boy!</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: Where they headed!</p>
<p><strong>cooley</strong>: Lump. I.O.</p>
<p><strong>cooley</strong>: Sweet summer rain. Like God’s own mercy.</p>
<p><strong>cooley</strong>: Your two friends have abandoned you, Pete.
They don’t seem to care ’bout your hide.</p>
<p><strong>cooley</strong>: …Okay.</p>
<p><strong>cooley</strong>: Stairway to heaven, Pete.</p>
<p><strong>cooley</strong>: We shall all meet, by and by.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Goddamnit!</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Godfer gimme!</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Believe me, Delmar, he would’ve wanted us
to press on. Pete, rest his soul, was one sour-assed sonofabitch and not
given to acts of pointless sentimentality.</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: It just don’t seem right, diggin’ up that
treasure without him.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Maybe it’s for the best that Pete was
squushed. Why, he was barely a sentient bein’. Now, soon as we clean
ourselves up, get a little smell’um in our hair, we’re just gonna feel a
hunnert per cent better about ourselves and about…</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: …and about… life in general…</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Jesus. We must be near Parchman Farm.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Sorry sonsabitches… Seems like a year ago
we bust off the farm…</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Pete have a brother?</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: Not that I’m aware.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Heat must be gettin’ to me.</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: And I say to you that the great state a
Mississippi cannot afford four more years a Pappy O’Daniel - four more
years a cronyism, nepotism, rascalism and service to the Innarests! The
choice, she’s a clear ’un: Pappy O’Daniel, slave a the Innarests; Homer
Stokes, servant a the little man! Ain’t that right, little fella?</p>
<p><strong>midget</strong>: He ain’t lyin’!</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: When the litle man says jump, Homer Stokes
says how high? And, ladies’n jettymens, the little man has admonished me
to grasp the broom a - ree-form and sweep this state clean!</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: It’s gonna be back to the flour mill, Pappy!
The Innarests can take care a theyselves! Come Tuesday, we gonna sweep
the rascals out! Clean gummint - yours for the askin’!</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: An’ now - the little Wharvey gals! Whatcha
got for us, darlin’s?</p>
<p><strong>little girl</strong>: ‘In the Highways’!</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: That’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Wharvey gals?! Did he just say the little
Wharvey gals?</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Goddamnit all!</p>
<p><strong>girls</strong>: In the highways, In the hedges…</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: You know them gals, Everett?</p>
<p><strong>youngest</strong>: Daddy!</p>
<p><strong>middle</strong>: He ain’t our daddy!</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Hell I ain’t! Whatsis ‘Wharvey’ gals? -
Your name’s McGill!</p>
<p><strong>youngest</strong>: No sir! Not since you got hit by a
train!</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: What’re you talkin’ about - I wasn’t hit by

<p><strong>middle</strong>: Mama said you was hit by a train!</p>
<p><strong>youngest</strong>: Blooey!</p>
<p><strong>oldest</strong>: Nothin’ left!</p>
<p><strong>middle</strong>: Just a grease spot on the L&amp;N!</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Damnit, I never been hit by any train!</p>
<p><strong>oldest</strong>: At’s right! So Mama’s got us back to
Wharvey!</p>
<p><strong>middle</strong>: That’s a maiden name.</p>
<p><strong>youngest</strong>: You got a maiden name, Daddy?</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: No, Daddy ain’t got a maiden name; ya see
-</p>
<p><strong>middle</strong>: That’s your misfortune!</p>
<p><strong>youngest</strong>: At’s right! And now Mama’s got a new
beau!</p>
<p><strong>oldest</strong>: He’s a suitor!</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Yeah, I know ’bout that.</p>
<p><strong>middle</strong>: Mama says he’s bona fide!</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Hm. He give her a ring?</p>
<p><strong>youngest</strong>: Yassir, big’un!</p>
<p><strong>middle</strong>: Gotta gem!</p>
<p><strong>oldest</strong>: Mama checked it!</p>
<p><strong>youngest</strong>: It’s bona fide!</p>
<p><strong>middle</strong>: He’s a suitor!</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Hm. What’s his name?</p>
<p><strong>middle</strong>: Vernon T. Waldrip.</p>
<p><strong>youngest</strong>: Uncle Vernon.</p>
<p><strong>oldest</strong>: Till tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>youngest</strong>: Then he’s gonna be Daddy!</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: I’m the only damn daddy you got! I’m the
damn paterfamilias!</p>
<p><strong>oldest</strong>: Yeah, but you ain’t bona fide!</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Hm. Where’s your mama?</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: And now let’s fetch back the Wharvey gals to
sing ‘I’ll Fly Away’.</p>
<p><strong>middle</strong>: She’s at the five and dime.</p>
<p><strong>youngest</strong>: Buyin’ nipples!</p>
<p><strong>girls</strong>: Daddy!</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Who the hell is that?!</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Starla Wharvey.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Starla McGill you mean! How come you never
told me about her?</p>
<p><strong>six-year-old</strong>: ’Cause you was hit by a train.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: And that’s another thing - why’re you
tellin’ our gals I was hit by a train!</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Lotta respectable people been hit by trains.
Judge Hobby over in Cookeville was hit by a train. What was I supposed
to tell ’em - that you was sent to the penal farm and I divorced you
from shame?</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Well - I take your point. But it leaves me
in a damned awkward position vis-a-vis my progeny.</p>
<p><strong>boater</strong>: ’Lo Penny… This gentleman bothering you?</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: You Waldrip?</p>
<p><strong>boater</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: …Have you been using my hair treatment?</p>
<p><strong>waldrip</strong>: Your hair treatment?!</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: S’cuse me…</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Well, I got news for you case you hadn’t
noticed - I wasn’t hit by a train. And I’ve traveled many a weary mile
to be back with my wife and six daughters.</p>
<p><strong>six-year-old</strong>: Seven, Daddy!</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: That ain’t your daddy, Alvinelle. Your daddy
was hit by a train.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Now Penny, stop that!</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: No - you stop it! Vernon here’s got a job.
Vernon’s got prospects. He’s bona fide! What’re you?</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: I’ll tell you what I am - I’m the
paterfamilias! You can’t marry him!</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: I can and I am and I will - tomorrow! I gotta
think about the little Wharvey gals! They look to me for answers! Vernon
can s’port ’em and buy ’em lessons on the clarinet! The only good thing
you ever did for the gals was get his by that train!</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: …Why you… lyin,… unconstant… succubus!</p>
<p><strong>waldrip</strong>: You can’t swear at my fiancee!</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Oh yeah? Well you can’t marry my wife!</p>
<p><strong>bystanders</strong>: Who is that man?</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: He’s not my husband. Just a drifter, I guess…
Just some no-account drifter…</p>
<p><strong>brawny manager</strong>: …And stay out of Woolworth’s!</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Deceitful! Two-faced! She-Woman! Never
trust a female, Delmar! Remember that one simple precept and your time
with me will not have been ill spent!</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: Okay, Everett.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Hit by a train! Truth means nothin’ to
Woman, Delmar. Triumph a the subjective! You ever been with a woman?</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: Well, uh, I - I gotta get the family farm
back before I can start thinkin’ about that.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Well that’s right! If then! Believe me,
Delmar, Woman is the most fiendish instrument of torture ever devised to
bedevil the days a man!</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: Everett, I never figured you for a
paterfamilias.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Oh-ho-ho yes, I’ve spread my seed. And you
see what it, uh… what it’s earned me… Now what in the…</p>
<p><strong>first guard</strong>: …Okay boys! Enjoy yer pickcha show!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Do not seek the treasure! It’s a
bushwhack!</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: …Pete?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: They’re fixin’ a ambush! Do not seek the
treasure!</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: …Pete?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Do not seek the treasure!</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: We thought you was a toad!</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: We thought… you was… a toad!</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Do not… seek… the treasure!</p>

<p><strong>eckard</strong>: Suckin’ away.</p>
<p><strong>spivey</strong>: Well, it’s a well-run campaign, midget’n
broom’n whatnot.</p>
<p><strong>eckard</strong>: Devil his due.</p>
<p><strong>spivey</strong>: Helluva awgazation.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: Say, I gotten idee.</p>
<p><strong>eckard</strong>: What sat, Junior?</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: We could hire us a little fella even
smaller’n Stokes’s.</p>
<p><strong>pappy</strong>: Y’ignorant slope-shouldered sack a guts! Why

our own midget! Don’t matter how stumpy! And that’s the goddamn problem
right there - people think this Stokes got fresh ideas, he’s oh coorant

<p><strong>eckard</strong>: Problem a p’seption.</p>
<p><strong>spivey</strong>: Ass right.</p>

<p><strong>spivey</strong>: Gonna paddle ah little bee-hind.</p>
<p><strong>eckard</strong>: Ain’t gonna paddle it; he’s gonna kick it

<p><strong>spivey</strong>: No, I believe he’s a-gonna paddle it.</p>
<p><strong>eckard</strong>: Well now, I don’t believe assa property

<p><strong>voice</strong>: Pete!</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Hold still.</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: …Cain’t stand much longer.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: It was a moment a weakness!</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Quitcha babblin’ Pete - time to
skedaddle.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: They lured me out for a bathe, then they
dunked me’n trussed me up like a hog and turned me in for the
bounty.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: I shoulda guessed it - typical womanly
behavior. Just lucky we left before they came for us.</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: We didn’t abandon you, Pete, we just thought
you was a toad.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: No, they never did turn me into a toad.</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: Well that was our mistake then. And then we
was beat up by a bible salesman and banished from Woolworth’s. I don’t
know if it’s the one branch or all of ’em.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Well I - I ain’t had it easy either, boys. Uh,
frankly, I - well I spilled my guts about the treasure.</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: Huh?!</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Awful sorry I betrayed you fellas; must be my
Hogwallop blood.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Aw, that’s all right, Pete.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: It’s awful white of ya to take it like that,
Everett. I feel wretched, spoilin’ yer play for a million dollars’n
point two. It’s been eatin’ at my guts.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Aw, that’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: You boys’re true friends!</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: You’re m’boon companions!</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Pete, uh, I don’t want ya to beat yourself
up about this thing…</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: I cain’t help it, but that’s a wonderful thing
to say!</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Well, but Pete…</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Uh, the fact of the matter is - well,
damnit, there ain’t no treasure!</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Fact of the matter - there never was!</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: But… but…</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: So - where’s all the money from your
armored-car job?</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: I never knocked over any armored- car. I
was sent up for practicing law without a license.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: But…</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Damnit, I just hadda bust out! My wife
wrote me she was gettin’ married! I gotta stop it!</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: …No treasure… I had two weeks left on my
sentence…</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: I couldn’t wait two weeks! She’s gettin’
married tomorra!</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: …With my added time for the escape, I don’t
get out now ’til 1987… I’ll be eighty-four years old.</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: Huh. I guess they’ll tack on fifty years for
me too.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Boys, we was chained together. I hadda tell
ya somethin’. Bustin’ out alone was not a option!</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: …Eighty-four years old.</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: I’ll only be eighty-two.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Pete… I do apologize.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Eighty-four years old! I’ll be gummin’
pab-you-lum!</p>
<p><strong>black man</strong>: I ain’t never harmed any you
gentlemen!</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: It’s Tommy! They got Tommy!</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: Oh my God!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I ain’t never harmed nobody!</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: The noose. Sweet Jesus! We gotta save ’im!</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: The color guard.</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: Brothers! We are foregathered here to
preserve our hallowed culture’n heritage! From intrusions, inclusions
and dilutions! Of culluh! Of creed! Of our ol’-time religion!</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: We aim to pull evil up by the root! Before

not forget those ladies, y’all, lookin’ to us for p’tection! From
darkies! From Jews! From Papists! And from all those smart-ass folk say
we come descended from the monkeys! That’s not my culture’n
heritage!</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: Izzat your culture’n heritage?</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: And so… we gonna hang us a neegra!</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Hey Tommy! It’s us!</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Hey Tommy!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: …Huh?</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: It’s us! We come to rescue ya!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: That’s mighty kind of ya boys, but I don’t
think nothin’s gonna save me now - the devil’s come to collect his
due!</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Tommy, you don’t wanna get hanged!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Naw I don’t guess I do, but that’s the way it
seems to be workin’ out.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Listen to me, Tommy, I got a plan -</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: The color guard is colored!</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Run, boys!</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: Who made them the color guard?</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: Damn! Can’t let that flag touch the
ground!</p>
<p><strong>pappy</strong>: I’m sayin’ we har this man away.</p>
<p><strong>eckard</strong>: Assa good idea, Pappy.</p>
<p><strong>spivey</strong>: Helluva idea.</p>
<p><strong>eckard</strong>: Cain’t beat ’em, join ’em.</p>
<p><strong>spivey</strong>: Have him join us, run our campaign ’stead a
that pencil-neck’s.</p>
<p><strong>eckard</strong>: Enticements a power, wealth, settera.</p>
<p><strong>spivey</strong>: No one says no to Pappy O’Daniel.</p>
<p><strong>eckard</strong>: Oh gracious no. Not with his
blandishments.</p>
<p><strong>spivey</strong>: Powas p’suasion.</p>
<p><strong>pappy</strong>: What’s his name again?</p>
<p><strong>eckard</strong>: Campaign manager? Waldrip.</p>
<p><strong>spivey</strong>: Vernon Waldrip.</p>
<p><strong>eckard</strong>: Vernon T. Waldrip.</p>
<p><strong>pappy</strong>: Hmm… His folks from out Tuscarora?</p>
<p><strong>spivey</strong>: Tuscarora? Might be. I b’lieve they is.</p>
<p><strong>eckard</strong>: Not a doubt in my mind.</p>
<p><strong>pappy</strong>: You don’t know where his goddamn folks from;
you speakin’ outcha asshole.</p>
<p><strong>eckard</strong>: Well now Pappy I wouldn’t put it that
strong…</p>
<p><strong>eckard</strong>: …but p’haps yaw right…</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Well, it’s a invitation-only affair; we’ll
have to sneak in through the service entrance-</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Wait a minute - who elected you leader a this
outfit? Since we been followin’ your lead we got nothin’ but trouble! I
gotten this close to bein’ strung up, n’consumed in a fire, ’n whipped
no end, ’n sunstroked, ’n soggied -</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: ’N turned into a frog -</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: He was never turned into a frog!</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: Almost loved up though.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: So you’re against me now, too!… Is that how
it is, boys?</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: The whole world and God Almighty… and now
you. Well, maybe I deserve this. Boys, I… I know I’ve made some tactical
mistakes. But if you’ll just stick with me; I need your help. And I’ve
got a plan. Believe me, boys, we can fix this thing! I can get my wife
back! We can get outta here!</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: …goddamn disgrace. Made a travesty of the
entire evenin’…</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: …what I wouldn’t give to get my hands on
those agitators. Whoever heard a such behavior. Even among culluds. Or
mulattos, maybe - I suspect some miscegenation in their heritage… how
else you goin’ explain it - usin’ the Confed’it flag as a missile…</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Scuse me… scuse me… we’re the next act…</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: Everett, my beard itches.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: This is crazy. No one’s ever gonna believe
we’re a real band.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: No, this is gonna work! I just gotta get
close enough to talk to her. Takin’ off with us is got a lot more future
in it than marrying a guy named Waldrip. I’m goddamn bona fide. I’ve got
the answers!</p>
<p><strong>waldrip</strong>: Well that’s a improper suggestion! I can’t
switch sides in the middle of a campaign! Especially to work for a man
who lacks moral fibre!</p>
<p><strong>pappy</strong>: Moral fibre?!</p>
<p><strong>pappy</strong>: You pasty-faced sonofabitch, I invented moral
fibre!</p>
<p><strong>pappy</strong>: Pappy O’Daniel was displayin’ rectitude and
high-mindedness when that pencil-neck you work for was still messin’ his
drawers!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Psst! Penny! Hey! Up here!</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Penny! It’s me!</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: No, Penny, listen! We’re leavin’ the state!
Pusuin’ opportunities in another venue! I got big plans! Not minstrelsy;
this-here’s just a dodge - I’m gonna be a dentist! I know a guy who’ll
print me up a license! I wanna be what you want me to be, honey! I want
you and the gals to come with me!</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: They’re my daughters, Penny! I’m the king a
this goddamn castle!</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: What’re you doin’ here, Pappy? I guess
someone let on there was free liquor, heh-heh.</p>
<p><strong>pappy</strong>: Yeah, you’ll be laughin’ out the other side
your face come November.</p>
<p><strong>eckard</strong>: Pappy O’Daniel be laughing’ then.</p>
<p><strong>spivey</strong>: Not out the other side his face, though.</p>
<p><strong>eckard</strong>: Oh no, no, just the reg’la side -</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Hot damn! Itsa Soggy Bottom Boys!</p>
<p><strong>pappy</strong>: Holy-moly. These boys’re a hit!</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: But Pappy, they’s inter-grated.</p>
<p><strong>pappy</strong>: Well I guess folks don’t mind they’s
integrated.</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: Wait a minute…</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: …you’s miscegenated! All you boys!
Miscegenated!</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: Get me a mike-a-phone!</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: These boys is not white! These boys is not
white! Hell, they ain’t even ol’-timey! I happen to know, ladies’n
gentlemen, this band a miscreants here, this very evening, they
interfered with a lynch mob inna performance of its duties!</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: It’s true! I b’long to a certain society, I
don’t believe I gotta mention its name, heh-heh…</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: …Ahem. And these boys here trampled all over
our venerated observances an’ rich’ls! Now this-here music is over! I
aim to -</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: I aim to hand these boys over to - listen to
me, folks!</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: Listen to me! These boys desecrated a fiery
cross!</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: And they convicts! Fugitives, folks, escaped
off the farm!</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: Folks, these boys gotta be remanded the
’thorities! Criminals! And I happen to have it from the highest
authority that that Neegra sold his soul to the devil!</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Is you is or
is you ain’t my constichency?</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: Is you is or is you ain’t -</p>
<p><strong>pappy</strong>: Goddamn! Oppitunity knocks!</p>
<p><strong>pappy</strong>: That’s fine, that’s fine!…</p>
<p><strong>pappy</strong>: …Ladies’n gentlemens here and listenin’ at
home, the great state of Mississippi thanks the Soggy Bottom Boys for
that won-a-ful performance!</p>
<p><strong>pappy</strong>: Now it looks like the only man in our great
state who ain’t a music luvva, is my esteemed opponent in the upcomin’,
Homer Stokes -</p>
<p><strong>pappy</strong>: Yeah, well, they ain’t no accountin’ f’taste.
It sounded t’me like he harbored some kind a hateful grudge against the
Soggy Bottom Boys on account a their rough’n rowdy past.</p>
<p><strong>pappy</strong>: Sounds like Homer Stokes is the kinda fella
gonna cast the first stone!</p>
<p><strong>pappy</strong>: Well I’m with you folks. I’m a f’give and
f’get Christian. And I say, well, if their rambunctiousness and
misdemeanorin’ is behind ’em - It is, ain’t it, boys?</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Sure is, Governor.</p>
<p><strong>pappy</strong>: Why then I say, by the par vested in me,
these boys is hereby pardoned!</p>
<p><strong>pappy</strong>: And furthermore, in the second Pappy O’Daniel
administration, why, these boys - is gonna be my brain trust!</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: What sat mean exactly, Everett?</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Well, you’n me’n Pete’n Tommy are gonna be
the power behind the throne so to speak.</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: Oh, okay.</p>
<p><strong>pappy</strong>: So now, without further ado, and by way of
endorsin’ my candidacy, the Soggy Bottom Boys is gonna lead us all in a
chorus of ‘You Are My Sunshine’ - ain’t ya, boys?</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: …Governor - that’s one of our
favorites!</p>
<p><strong>pappy</strong>: Son, you gonna go far.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: I guess Vernon T. Waldrip is gonna be goin’
on relief. Maybe I’ll be able to throw a little patronage his way, get
the man a job diggin’ ditches or rounding up stray dogs.</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: Is the marriage off then, Miz Wharvey?</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: McGill. No, the marriage’ll take place as
planned.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Just a little change of cast. Me and the
little lady are gonna pick up the pieces’n retie the knot,
mixaphorically speakin’. You boys’re invited, of course. Hell, you’re
best men! Already got the rings.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Where’s your ring, honey?</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: I ain’t worn it since our divorce came
through. It must still be in the rolltop in the old cabin. Never thought
I’d need it; Vernon bought one encrusted with jewels.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Hell, now’s the time to buy it off him
cheap.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: We ain’t gettin’ married with his ring! You
said you’d changed!</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Aw, honey, our ring is just a old pewter
thing -</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Ain’t gonna be no weddin’.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: It’s just a symbol, honey -</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: No weddin’.</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: We’ll go fetch it with ya, Everett.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Honey, it’s just - Shutup, Delmar - it’s
just -</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: I have spoken my piece and counted to
three.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Oh, goddamnit! She counted to three!
Sonofabitch! You know how far that cabin is?!</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: George!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: ‘Lo, boys! Well, these little men finally
caught up with the criminal a the century! Looks like the chair for
George Nelson. Yup! Gonna electrify me! I’m gonna go off like a Roman
candle! Twenty thousand volts chasin’ the rabbit through yours truly!
Gonna shoot sparks out the top of my head and lightning from my
fingertips!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yessir! Gonna suck all the power right outa
the state! Goddamn, boys, I’m on top of the world! I’M GEORGE</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: Looks like George is right back on top
again.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Well, at least you boys’ll get to see the
old manse - the home where I spent so many happy days in the bosom of my
family - a refugium, if you will - with a mighty oak tree out front and
a happy little tire swing…</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: Where’s the happy little tire swing?</p>
<p><strong>cooley</strong>: End of the road, boys. It’s had its twists
and turns -</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Waitaminute -</p>
<p><strong>cooley</strong>: - but now it deposits you here.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Waitaminute -</p>
<p><strong>cooley</strong>: You have eluded fate - and eluded me - for
the last time. Tie their hands, boys.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: You can’t do this -</p>
<p><strong>cooley</strong>: Didn’t know you’d be bringin’ a friend.
Well, he’ll have to wait his turn -</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Hang on there -</p>
<p><strong>cooley</strong>: - and share one of your graves.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: You can’t do this - we just been pardoned!
By the Governer himself!</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: It went out over the radio!</p>
<p><strong>cooley</strong>: Is that right?</p>
<p><strong>cooley</strong>: …Too bad we don’t have a radio.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: God have Mercy!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: It ain’t fittin’!</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: It ain’t the law!</p>
<p><strong>cooley</strong>: The law. Well the law is a human
institution.</p>
<p><strong>cooley</strong>: Perhaps you should take a moment for your
prayers.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Oh my God! Everett!</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: I’m sorry we got you into this, Tommy.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Good Lord, what do we do?</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Oh Lord, please look down and recognize us
poor sinners… please Lord…</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: …I just want to see my daughters again. Oh
Lord, I’ve been separated from my family for so long…</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: …I know I’ve been guilty of pride and sharp
dealing. I’m sorry that I turned my back on you, Lord. Please forgive
me, and help us, Lord, and I swear I’ll mend my ways… For the sake of my
family… For Tommy’s sake, and Delmar’s, and Pete’s…</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: …Let me see my daughters again. Please,
Lord, help us… Please help us…</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: A miracle! It was a miracle!</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Aw, don’t be ignorant, Delmar. I told you
they was gonna flood this valley.</p>
<p><strong>delmar</strong>: That ain’t it!</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: We prayed to God and he pitied us!</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: It just never fails; once again you two
hayseeds are showin’ how much you want for innalect. There’s a perfectly
scientific explanation for what just happened -</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: That ain’t the tune you were singin’ back
there at the gallows!</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Well any human being will cast about in a
moment of stress. No, the fact is, they’re flooding this valley so they
can hydro-electric up the whole durned state…</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Yessir, the South is gonna change.
Everything’s gonna be put on electricity and run on a payin’ basis. Out
with the old spiritual mumbo- jumbo, the superstitions and the backward
ways. We’re gonna see a brave new world where they run everyone a wire
and hook us all up to a grid. Yessir, a veritable age of reason - like
the one they had in France - and not a moment too soon…</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Not a moment too soon. Say, there’s
Tommy!</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: What you ridin’ there, Tommy?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Rolltop desk…</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: All’s well that ends well, as the poet
says.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: That’s right, honey.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: But I don’t mind telling you, I’m awful
pleased my adventuring days is at an end…</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: …Time for this old boy to enjoy some
repose.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: That’s good, honey.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: And you were right about that ring. Any
other weddin’ band would not do. But this-here was foreordained, honey;
fate was a-smilin’ on me, and ya have to have confidence -</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: That’s not my ring.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: - in the gods - Huh?</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: That’s not my ring.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Not your…</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: That’s one of Aunt Hurlene’s.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: You said it was in the rolltop desk!</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: I said I thought it was in the rolltop
desk.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: You said -</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Or, it might a been under the mattress.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: You -</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Or in my chiffonier. I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Well, I’m sorry honey -</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Well, we need that ring.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Well now honey, that ring is at the bottom
of a pretty durned big lake.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: A 9,000-hectacre lake, honey.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: I don’t care if it’s ninety thousand.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Yes, but honey -</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: That wasn’t my doing…</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Course not, honey, but…</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: I counted to three, honey.</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: Well sure, honey, but…</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: …finding one little ring in the middle of
all that water…</p>
<p><strong>everett</strong>: …that is one hell of a heroic task…</p>
