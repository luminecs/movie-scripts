<h1 id="the-shawshank-redemption">the-shawshank-redemption</h1>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Oh god…oh god…oh god…</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Oh god…that’s sooo good…you’re the best…the
best I ever had…</p>
<p><strong>d.a.</strong>: Mr. Dufresne, describe the confrontation you
had with your wife the night she was murdered.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: It was very bitter. She said she was glad I
knew, that she hated all the sneaking around. She said she wanted a
divorce in Reno.</p>
<p><strong>d.a.</strong>: What was your response?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I told her I would not grant one.</p>
<p><strong>d.a.</strong>: I’ll see you in Hell before I see you in Reno.
Those were the words you used, Mr. Dufresne, according to the testimony
of your neighbors.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: If they say so. I really don’t remember. I was
upset.</p>
<p><strong>d.a.</strong>: What happened after you and your wife
argued?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: She packed a bag and went to stay with
Mr. Quentin.</p>
<p><strong>d.a.</strong>: Glenn Quentin. The golf pro at the Falmouth
Hills Country Club. The man you had recently discovered was her lover.
Did you follow her?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I went to a few bars first. Later, I decided
to drive to Mr. Quentin’s home and confront them. They weren’t there…so
I parked my car in the turnout…and waited.</p>
<p><strong>d.a.</strong>: With what intention?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I’m not sure. I was confused. Drunk. I think
mostly I wanted to scare them.</p>
<p><strong>d.a.</strong>: You had a gun with you?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Yes. I did.</p>
<p><strong>d.a.</strong>: When they arrived, you went up to the house
and murdered them?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: No. I was sobering up. I realized she wasn’t
worth it. I decided to let her have her quickie divorce.</p>
<p><strong>d.a.</strong>: Quickie divorce indeed. A .38 caliber divorce,
wrapped in a handtowel to muffle the shots, isn’t that what you mean?
And then you shot her lover!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I did not. I got back in the car and drove
home to sleep it off. Along the way, I stopped and threw my gun into the
Royal River. I feel I’ve been very clear on this point.</p>
<p><strong>d.a.</strong>: Yes, you have. Where I get hazy, though, is
the part where the cleaning woman shows up the next morning and finds
your wife and her lover in bed, riddled with .38 caliber bullets. Does
that strike you as a fantastic coincidence, Mr. Dufresne, or is it just
me?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Yes. It does.</p>
<p><strong>d.a.</strong>: I’m sorry, Mr. Dufresne, I don’t think the
jury heard that.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Yes. It does.</p>
<p><strong>d.a.</strong>: Does what?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Strike me as a fantastic coincidence.</p>
<p><strong>d.a.</strong>: On that, sir, we are in accord…</p>
<p><strong>d.a.</strong>: You claim you threw your gun into the Royal
River before the murders took place. That’s rather convenient.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: It’s the truth.</p>
<p><strong>d.a.</strong>: You recall Lt. Mincher’s testimony? He and his
men dragged that river for three days and nary a gun was found. So no
comparison can be made between your gun and the bullets taken from the
bloodstained corpses of the victims. That’s also rather convenient,
isn’t it, Mr. Dufresne?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Since I am innocent of this crime, sir, I find
it decidedly inconvenient the gun was never found.</p>
<p><strong>d.a.</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen, you’ve heard all the
evidence, you know all the facts. We have the accused at the scene of
the crime. We have foot prints. Tire tracks. Bullets scattered on the
ground which bear his fingerprints. A broken bourbon bottle, likewise
with fingerprints. Most of all, we have a beautiful young woman and her
lover lying dead in each other’s arms. They had sinned. But was their
crime so great as to merit a death sentence?</p>
<p><strong>d.a.</strong>: I suspect Mr. Dufresne’s answer to that would
be yes. I further suspect he carried out that sentence on the night of
September 21st, this year of our Lord, 1946, by pumping four bullets
into his wife and another four into Glenn Quentin. And while you think
about that, think about this…</p>
<p><strong>d.a.</strong>: A revolver holds six bullets, not eight. I
submit to you this was not a hot-blooded crime of passion! That could at
least be understood, if not condoned. No, this was revenge of a much
more brutal and cold-blooded nature. Consider! Four bullets per victim!
Not six shots fired, but eight! That means he fired the gun empty…and
then stopped to reload so he could shoot each of them again! An extra
bullet per lover…right in the head. I’m done talking. You people are all
decent, God-fearing Christian folk. You know what to do.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty…</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: You strike me as a particularly icy and
remorseless man, Mr. Dufresne. It chills my blood just to look at you.
By the power vested in me by the State of Maine, I hereby order you to
serve two life sentences, back to back, one for each of your victims. So
be it.</p>
<p><strong>man #1</strong>: Sit.</p>
<p><strong>man #2</strong>: We see by your file you’ve served twenty
years of a life sentence.</p>
<p><strong>man #3</strong>: You feel you’ve been rehabilitated?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Yes, sir. Absolutely. I’ve learned my lesson. I
can honestly say I’m a changed man. I’m no longer a danger to society.
That’s the God’s honest truth. No doubt about it.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: There’s a con like me in every prison in
America, I guess. I’m the guy who can get it for you. Cigarettes, a bag
of reefer if you’re partial, a bottle of brandy to celebrate your kid’s
high school graduation. Damn near anything, within reason.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Yes sir, I’m a regular Sears &amp; Roebuck.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: So when Andy Dufresne came to me in 1949 and
asked me to smuggle Rita Hayworth into the prison for him, I told him no
problem. And it wasn’t.</p>
<p><strong>con</strong>: Fresh fish! Fresh fish today!</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Andy came to Shawshank Prison in early 1947 for
murdering his wife and the fella she was bangin’.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: On the outside, he’d been vice- president of a
large Portland bank. Good work for a man as young as he was, when you
consider how conservative banks were back then.</p>
<p><strong>tower guard</strong>: All clear!</p>
<p><strong>hadley</strong>: On your feet before I fuck you up so bad you
never walk again.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: There they are, boys. The Human Charm
Bracelet.</p>
<p><strong>heywood</strong>: Never seen such a sorry-lookin’ heap of
maggot shit in my life.</p>
<p><strong>jigger</strong>: Comin’ from you, Heywood, you being so
pretty and all…</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: Takin’ bets today, Red?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Bear Catholic? Pope shit in the woods? Smokes
or coin, bettor’s choice.</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: Smokes. Put me down for two.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: High roller. Who’s your horse?</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: That gangly sack of shit, third from the
front. He’ll be the first.</p>
<p><strong>heywood</strong>: Bullshit. I’ll take that action.</p>
<p><strong>ernie</strong>: Me too.</p>
<p><strong>heywood</strong>: You’re out some smokes, son. Take my
word.</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: You’re so smart, you call it.</p>
<p><strong>heywood</strong>: I say that chubby fat-ass…let’s see…fifth
from the front. Put me down for a quarter deck.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: That’s five cigarettes on Fat-Ass. Any
takers?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: I must admit I didn’t think much of Andy first
time I laid eyes on him. He might’a been important on the outside, but
in here he was just a little turd in prison grays. Looked like a stiff
breeze could blow him over. That was my first impression of the man.</p>
<p><strong>skeet</strong>: What say, Red?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Little fella on the end. Definitely. I stake
half a pack. Any takers?</p>
<p><strong>snooze</strong>: Rich bet.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: C’mon, boys, who’s gonna prove me wrong? Floyd,
Skeet, Joe, Heywood. Four brave souls, ten smokes apiece. That’s it,
gentlemen, this window’s closed.</p>
<p><strong>hadley</strong>: Eyes front.</p>
<p><strong>norton</strong>: This is Mr. Hadley, captain of the guard. I
am Mr. Norton, the warden. You are sinners and scum, that’s why they
sent you to me. Rule number one: no blaspheming. I’ll not have the
Lord’s name taken in vain in my prison. The other rules you’ll figure
out as you go along. Any questions?</p>
<p><strong>con</strong>: When do we eat?</p>
<p><strong>norton</strong>: Any other questions? I believe in two
things. Discipline and the Bible. Here, you’ll receive both. Put your
faith in the Lord. Your ass belongs to me. Welcome to Shawshank.</p>
<p><strong>hadley</strong>: Off with them clothes! And I didn’t say take
all day doing it, did I?</p>
<p><strong>hadley</strong>: First man into the shower!</p>
<p><strong>hadley</strong>: Delouse that piece of shit! Next man in!</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Bend over.</p>
<p><strong>chaplain</strong>: …maketh me to lie down in green pastures.
He leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul…</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: The first night’s the toughest, no doubt about
it. They march you in naked as the day you’re born, fresh from a Bible
reading, skin burning and half-blind from that delousing shit they throw
on you…</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: …and when they put you in that cell, when those
bars slam home, that’s when you know it’s for real. Old life blown away
in the blink of an eye…a long cold season in hell stretching out
ahead…nothing left but all the time in the world to think about it.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Most new fish come close to madness the first
night. Somebody always breaks down crying. Happens every time. The only
question is, who’s it gonna be?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: It’s as good a thing to bet on as any, I guess.
I had my money on Andy Dufresne…</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: That’s lights out! Good night, ladies.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: I remember my first night. Seems a long time
ago now.</p>
<p><strong>various voices</strong>: Fishee fishee fisheeee…You’re gonna
like it here, new fish. A whooole lot…Make you wish your daddies never
dicked your mommies…You takin’ this down, new fish? Gonna be a quiz
later. Sshhh. Keep it down. The screws’ll hear…Fishee fishee
fisheeee…</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: The boys always go fishin’ with
first-timers…and they don’t quit till they reel someone in.</p>
<p><strong>22 int – various cells – night 22</strong>: thru thru 25 2g
…while the new cons go quietly crazy in their cells. One man paces like
a caged animal…another sits gnawing his cuticles bloody…a third is
weeping silently…a fourth is dry-heaving into the toilet…</p>
<p><strong>heywood</strong>: Fat-Ass…oh, Faaaat-Ass. Talk to me, boy. I
know you’re in there. I can hear you breathin’. Now don’t you listen to
these nitwits, hear?</p>
<p><strong>heywood</strong>: This ain’t such a bad place. I’ll introduce
you around, make you feel right at home. I know some big ol’ bull queers
who’d love to make your acquaintance…especially that big white mushy
butt of yours…</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: Fresh fish…fresh fish…fresh fish…fresh
fish…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I had your mother! She wasn’t that great!</p>
<p><strong>hadley</strong>: What the Christ is this happy shit?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: He took the Lord’s name in vain! I’m tellin’
the warden!</p>
<p><strong>hadley</strong>: You’ll be tellin’ him with my baton up your
ass!</p>
<p><strong>hadley</strong>: What’s your malfunction you fat fuckin’
barrel of monkey-spunk?</p>
<p><strong>hadley</strong>: I ain’t gonna count to three! Not even to
one! Now shut the fuck up ’fore I sing you a lullabye!</p>
<p><strong>hadley</strong>: Get this tub of shit down to the infirmary.
If I hear so much as a mouse fart in here the rest of the night, by God
and Sonny Jesus, you’ll all visit the infirmary. Every last motherfucker
here.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: His first night in the joint, Andy Dufresne
cost me two packs of cigarettes. He never made a sound…</p>
<p><strong>brooks</strong>: You gonna eat that?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Hadn’t planned on it.</p>
<p><strong>brooks</strong>: You mind?</p>
<p><strong>brooks</strong>: Mmm. Nice and ripe.</p>
<p><strong>brooks</strong>: Jake says thanks. Fell out of his nest over
by the plate shop. I’m lookin’ after him till he’s old enough to
fly.</p>
<p><strong>jigger</strong>: Oh, Christ, here he comes.</p>
<p><strong>heywood</strong>: Mornin’, boys. It’s a fine mornin’. You
know why it’s fine?</p>
<p><strong>heywood</strong>: That’s right, send ’em all down. I wanna
see ’em lined up in a row, pretty as a chorus line.</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: Smell my ass…</p>
<p><strong>heywood</strong>: Gee, Red. Terrible shame, your horse comin’
in last and all. Hell, I sure do love that horse of mine. I believe I
owe that boy a big sloppy kiss when I see him.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Give him some’a your cigarettes instead, cheap
bastard.</p>
<p><strong>heywood</strong>: Say Tyrell, you pull infirmary duty this
week? How’s that winnin’ horse of mine, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: Dead. Hadley busted his head pretty good.
Doc already went home for the night. Poor bastard lay there till this
morning. By then…</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: What was his name?</p>
<p><strong>heywood</strong>: What? What’d you say?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I was wondering if anyone knew his name.</p>
<p><strong>heywood</strong>: What the fuck you care, new fish? Doesn’t
matter what his fuckin’ name was. He’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>bogs</strong>: Hard to get. I like that.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Hello. I’m Andy Dufresne.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: The wife-killin’ banker.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: How do you know that?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: I keep my ear to the ground. Why’d you do
it?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I didn’t, since you ask.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Hell, you’ll fit right in, then. Everyone’s
innocent in here, don’t you know that? Heywood! What are you in for,
boy?</p>
<p><strong>heywood</strong>: Didn’t do it! Lawyer fucked me!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: What else have you heard?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: People say you’re a cold fish. They say you
think your shit smells sweeter than ordinary. That true?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Ain’t made up my mind yet.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I understand you’re a man who knows how to get
things.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: I’m known to locate certain things from time to
time. They seem to fall into my hands. Maybe it’s ’cause I’m Irish.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I wonder if you could get me a
rock-hammer?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: What is it and why?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You make your customers’ motives a part of
your business?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: If you wanted a toothbrush, I wouldn’t ask
questions. I’d just quote a price. A toothbrush, see, is a non-lethal
sort of object.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Fair enough. A rock-hammer is about eight or
nine inches long. Looks like a miniature pickaxe, with a small sharp
pick on one end, and a blunt hammerhead on the other. It’s for
rocks.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Rocks.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Quartz?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Quartz, sure. And look. Mica. Shale. Silted
granite. There’s some graded limestone, from when they cut this place
out of the hill.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I’m a rockhound. At least I was, in my old
life. I’d like to be again, on a limited scale.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Yeah, that or maybe plant your toy in
somebody’s skull?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I have no enemies here.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: No? Just wait.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Word gets around. The Sisters have taken a real
shine to you, yes they have. Especially Bogs.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Tell me something. Would it help if I
explained to them I’m not homosexual?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Neither are they. You have to be human first.
They don’t qualify. Bull queers take by force, that’s all they want or
understand. I’d grow eyes in the back of my head if I were you.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Thanks for the advice.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: That comes free. But you understand my
concern.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: If there’s trouble, I doubt a rock- hammer
will do me any good.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Then I guess you wanna escape. Tunnel under the
wall maybe? I miss the joke. What’s so funny?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: What’s this item usually go for?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Seven dollars in any rock and gem shop.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: My standard mark-up’s twenty percent, but we’re
talkin’ about a special object. Risk goes up, price goes up. Call it ten
bucks even.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Ten it is.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: I’ll see what I can do. But it’s a waste of
money.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Oh?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Folks who run this place love surprise
inspections. They turn a blind eye to some things, but not a gadget like
that. They’ll find it, and you’ll lose it. Mention my name, we’ll never
do business again. Not for a pair of shoelaces or a stick of gum.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I understand. Thank you, Mr…?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Red. The name’s Red.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Red. I’m Andy. Pleasure doing business with
you.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: I could see why some of the boys took him for
snobby. He had a quiet way about him, a walk and a talk that just wasn’t
normal around here. He strolled. like a man in a park without a care or
worry. Like he had on an invisible coat that would shield him from this
place. Yes, I think it would be fair to say I liked Andy from the
start.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: He was a man who adapted fast.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Years later, I found out he’d brought in quite
a bit more than just ten dollars…</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: When they check you into this hotel, one of the
bellhops bends you over and looks up your works, just to make sure
you’re not carrying anything. But a truly determined man can get an
object quite a ways up there.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: That’s how Andy joined our happy little
Shawshank family with more than five hundred dollars on his person.
Determination.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Andy was right. I finally got the joke. It
would take a man about six hundred years to tunnel under the wall with
one of these.</p>
<p><strong>brooks</strong>: Middle shelf, wrapped in a towel.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You get this in your eyes, it blinds you.</p>
<p><strong>bogs</strong>: Honey, hush.</p>
<p><strong>bogs</strong>: That’s it, fight. Better that way.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: I wish I could tell you that Andy fought the
good fight, and the Sisters let him be. I wish I could tell you that,
but prison is no fairy-tale world.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: He never said who did it…but we all knew.</p>
<p><strong>47 andy plods through his days. working. eating. chipping and
47</strong>: shaping his rocks after lights-out…</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Things went on like that for a while. Prison
life consists of routine, and then more routine.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Every so often, Andy would show up with fresh
bruises.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: The Sisters kept at him. Sometimes he was able
to fight them off… sometimes not.</p>
<p><strong>50 andy backs into a corner in some dingy part of the
prison,</strong>: wildly swinging a rake at his tormentors.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: He always fought, that’s what I remember. He
fought because he knew if he didn’t fight, it would make it that much
easier not to fight the next time.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Half the time it landed him in the
infirmary…</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: …the other half, it landed him in solitary.
Warden Norton’s “grain &amp; drain” vacation. Bread, water, and all the
privacy you could want.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: And that’s how it went for Andy. That was his
routine. I do believe those first two years were the worst for him. And
I also believe if things had gone on that way, this place would have got
the best of him. But then, in the spring of 1949, the powers-that-be
decided that…</p>
<p><strong>norton</strong>: …the roof of the license-plate factory needs
resurfacing. I need a dozen volunteers for a week’s work. We’re gonna be
taking names in this steel bucket here…</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: It was outdoor detail, and May is one damn fine
month to be workin’ outdoors.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: More than a hundred men volunteered for the
job.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Wouldn’t you know it? Me and some fellas I know
were among the names called.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Only cost us a pack of smokes per man. I made
my usual twenty percent, of course.</p>
<p><strong>hadley</strong>: …so this shithead lawyer calls long distance
from Texas, and he says, Byron Hadley? I say, yeah. He says, sorry to
inform you, but your brother just died.</p>
<p><strong>youngblood</strong>: Damn, Byron. Sorry to hear that.</p>
<p><strong>hadley</strong>: I ain’t. He was an asshole. Run off years
ago, family ain’t heard of him since. Figured him for dead anyway. So
this lawyer prick says, your brother died a rich man. Oil wells and
shit, close to a million bucks. Jesus, it’s frigging incredible how
lucky some assholes can get.</p>
<p><strong>trout</strong>: A million bucks? Jeez-Louise! You get any of
that?</p>
<p><strong>hadley</strong>: Thirty five thousand. That’s what he left
me.</p>
<p><strong>trout</strong>: Dollars? Holy shit, that’s great! Like
winnin’ a lottery… …ain’t it?</p>
<p><strong>hadley</strong>: Dumbshit. What do you figger the
government’s gonna do to me? Take a big wet bite out of my ass, is
what.</p>
<p><strong>trout</strong>: Oh. Hadn’t thought of that.</p>
<p><strong>hadley</strong>: Maybe leave me enough to buy a new car with.
Then what happens? You pay tax on the car. Repairs and maintenance.
Goddamn kids pesterin’ you to take ’em for a ride…</p>
<p><strong>mert</strong>: And drive it, if they’re old enough.</p>
<p><strong>hadley</strong>: That’s right, wanting to drive it, wanting
to learn on it, f’Chrissake! Then at the end of the year, if you figured
the tax wrong, they make you pay out of your own pocket. Uncle Sam puts
his hand in your shirt and squeezes your tit till it’s purple. Always
get the short end. That’s a fact. Some brother. Shit.</p>
<p><strong>heywood</strong>: Poor Byron. What terrible fuckin’ luck.
Imagine inheriting thirty five thousand dollars.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Crying shame. Some folks got it awful bad.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Hey, you nuts? Keep your eyes on your pail!</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Andy! Come back! Shit!</p>
<p><strong>snooze</strong>: What’s he doing?</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: Gettin’ himself killed.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: God damn it…</p>
<p><strong>heywood</strong>: Just keep spreadin’ tar…</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Mr. Hadley. Do you trust your wife?</p>
<p><strong>hadley</strong>: That’s funny. You’re gonna look funnier
suckin’ my dick with no fuckin’ teeth.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: What I mean is, do you think she’d go behind
your back? Try to hamstring you?</p>
<p><strong>hadley</strong>: That’s it! Step aside, Mert. This fucker’s
havin’ hisself an accident.</p>
<p><strong>heywood</strong>: Oh God, he’s gonna do it, he’s gonna throw
him off the roof…</p>
<p><strong>snooze</strong>: Oh shit, oh fuck, oh Jesus…</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Because if you do trust her, there’s no reason
in the world you can’t keep every cent of that money.</p>
<p><strong>hadley</strong>: You better start making sense.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: If you want to keep that money, all of it,
just give it to your wife. See, the IRS allows you a one-time- only gift
to your spouse. It’s good up to sixty thousand dollars.</p>
<p><strong>hadley</strong>: Naw, that ain’t right! Tax free?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Tax free. IRS can’t touch one cent.</p>
<p><strong>hadley</strong>: You’re the smart banker what shot his wife.
Why should I believe a smart banker like you? So’s I can wind up in here
with you?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: It’s perfectly legal. Go ask the IRS, they’ll
say the same thing. Actually, I feel silly telling you all this. I’m
sure you would have investigated the matter yourself.</p>
<p><strong>hadley</strong>: Fuckin’-A. I don’t need no smart
wife-killin’ banker to show me where the bear shit in the buckwheat.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Of course not. But you will need somebody to
set up the tax-free gift, and that’ll cost you. A lawyer, for
example…</p>
<p><strong>hadley</strong>: Ambulance-chaaing, highway-robbing
cocksuckers!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: …or come to think of it, I suppose I could set
it up for you. That would save you some money. I’ll write down the forms
you need, you can pick them up, and I’ll prepare them for your
signature… nearly free of charge. I’d only ask three beers apiece for my
co-workers, if that seems fair.</p>
<p><strong>trout</strong>: Co-workers! Get him! That’s rich, ain’t it?
Co-workers…</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I think a nan working outdoors feels more like
a man if he can have a bottle of suds. That’s only my opinion.</p>
<p><strong>hadley</strong>: What are you jimmies starin’ at? Back to
work, goddamn it!</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: And that’s how it came to pass, that on the
second-to-last day of the job, the convict crew that tarred the plate
factory roof in the spring of ’49…</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: …wound up sitting in a row at ten o’clock in
the morning, drinking icy cold Black Label beer courtesy of the hardest
screw that ever walked a turn at Shawshank State Prison.</p>
<p><strong>hadley</strong>: Drink up, boys. While it’s cold.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: The colossal prick even managed to sound
magnanimous.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: We sat and drank with the sun on our shoulders,
and felt like free men. We could’a been tarring the</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: As for Andy, he spent that break hunkered in
the shade, a strange little smile on his face, watching us drink his
beer.</p>
<p><strong>heywood</strong>: Here’s a cold one, Andy.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: No thanks. I gave up drinking.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: You could argue he’d done it to curry favor
with the guards. Or maybe make a few friends among us cons. Me, I think
he did it just to feel normal again…if only for a short while.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: King me.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Chess. Now there’s a game of kings.
Civilized…strategic…</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: …and totally fuckin’ inexplicable. Hate that
game.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Maybe you’ll let me teach you someday. I’ve
been thinking of getting a board together.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: You come to the right place. I’m the man who
can get things.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: We might do business on a board. But the
pieces, I’d like to carve those myself. One side done in quartz… the
opposing side in limestone.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: That’d take you years.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Years I’ve got. What I don’t have are the
rocks. Pickings here in the exercise yard are pretty slim.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: How’s that rock-hammer workin’ out anyway?
Scratch your name on your wall yet?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Not yet. I suppose I should.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Andy? I guess we’re gettin’ to be friends,
ain’t we?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I suppose we are.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: I ask a question? Why’d you do it?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I’m innocent, remember? Just like everybody
else here.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: What are you in for, Red?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Murder. Same as you.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Innocent?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: The only guilty man in Shawshank.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Here’s the good part. Bugs come out of the
walls to get his ass.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I know. I’ve seen it three times this month
already.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Can we talk business?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Sure. What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Rita Hayworth. Can you get her?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: No problem. Take a few weeks.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Weeks?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Don’t have her stuffed down my pants this very
moment, sorry to say. Relax. What are you so nervous about? She’s just a
woman.</p>
<p><strong>bogs</strong>: Take a walk.</p>
<p><strong>projectionist</strong>: I have to change reels.</p>
<p><strong>bogs</strong>: I said fuck off.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I know. I’ve seen it three times this month
already.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Can we talk business?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Sure. What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Rita Hayworth. Can you get her?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: No problem. Take a few weeks.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Weeks?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Don’t have her stuffed down my pants this very
moment, sorry to say. Relax. What are you so nervous about? She’s just a
woman.</p>
<p><strong>bogs</strong>: Take a walk.</p>
<p><strong>projectionist</strong>: I have to change reels.</p>
<p><strong>bogs</strong>: I said fuck off.</p>
<p><strong>bogs</strong>: Ain’t you gonna scream?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: They’d never hear me over that. Let’s get this
over with.</p>
<p><strong>rooster</strong>: Me first.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>rooster</strong>: Fuck! Shit! He broke my nose!</p>
<p><strong>bogs</strong>: Now I’m gonna open my fly, and you’re gonna
swallow what I give you to swallow. And when you d mine, you gonna
swallow Rooster’s. You done broke his nose, so he ought to have
somethin’ to show for it.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Anything you put in my mouth, you’re going to
lose.</p>
<p><strong>bogs</strong>: You don’t understand. You do that, I’ll put
all eight inches of this steel ii your ear.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Okay. But you should know that sudden serious
brain injury causes the victim to bite down. Hard. In fact, I understand
the bite-reflex is so strong the victim’s jaws have to be pried open
with a crowbar.</p>
<p><strong>bogs</strong>: You little fuck.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Bogs didn’t put anything in Andy’s mouth, and
neither did his friends. What they did do is beat him within an inch of
his life…</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Andy spent a month in traction.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Bogs spent a week in the hole.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Time’s up, Bogs.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Return to your cellblocks for evening
count.</p>
<p><strong>mert</strong>: Damn, Byron. Look’a that.</p>
<p><strong>hadley</strong>: Poor fella must’a tripped.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Two things never happened again after that. The
Sisters never laid a finger on Andy again…</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: …and Bogs never walked again. They transferred
him to a minimum security hospital upstate. To my knowledge, he lived
out the rest of his days drinking his food through a straw.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: I’m thinkin’ Andy could use a nice welcome back
when he gets out of the infirmary.</p>
<p><strong>heywood</strong>: Sounds good to us. Figure we owe him for
the beer.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Man likes to play chess. Let’s get him some
rocks.</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: That ain’t quartz. Nor limestone.</p>
<p><strong>heywood</strong>: What are you, fuckin’ geologist?</p>
<p><strong>snooze</strong>: He’s right, it ain’t.</p>
<p><strong>heywood</strong>: What the hell is it then?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Horse apple.</p>
<p><strong>heywood</strong>: Bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: No, horse shit. Petrified.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Despite a few hitches, the boys came through in
fine style…</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: …and by the week Andy was due back, we had
enough rocks saved up to keep him busy till Rapture.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Also got a big shipment in that week.
Cigarettes, chewing gum, shoelaces, playing cards with naked ladies on
’em, you name it… …and, of course, the most important item.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Lights out!</p>
<p><strong>ernie</strong>: Heads up. They’re tossin’ cells.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: What kind’a contraband you hiding in there,
boy?</p>
<p><strong>norton</strong>: Solitary. A week. Make sure he takes his
Bible.</p>
<p><strong>con</strong>: Too goddamn dark to read down there.</p>
<p><strong>norton</strong>: Add another week for blasphemy.</p>
<p><strong>norton</strong>: Let’s try the second tier.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Good evening.</p>
<p><strong>norton</strong>: I’m pleased to see you reading this. Any
favorite passages?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Watch ye therefore, for ye know not when the
master of the house cometh.</p>
<p><strong>norton</strong>: Luke. Chapter 13, verse 35. I’ve always
liked that one. But I prefer: “I am the light of the world. He that
followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of
life.”</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: John. Chapter 8, verse 12.</p>
<p><strong>norton</strong>: I hear you’re good with numbers. How nice. A
man should have a skill.</p>
<p><strong>hadley</strong>: You wanna explain this?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: It’s called a rock blanket. It’s for shaping
and polishing rocks. Little hobby of mine.</p>
<p><strong>hadley</strong>: Looks pretty clean. Some contraband here,
nothing to get in a twist over.</p>
<p><strong>norton</strong>: I can’t say I approve of this… …but I
suppose exceptions can always be made.</p>
<p><strong>norton</strong>: I almost forgot.</p>
<p><strong>norton</strong>: I’d hate to deprive you of this. Salvation
lies within.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Tossin’ cells was just an excuse. Truth is,
Norton wanted to size Andy up.</p>
<p><strong>norton</strong>: My wife made that in church group.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: It’s very pretty, sir.</p>
<p><strong>norton</strong>: You like working in the laundry?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: No, sir. Not especially.</p>
<p><strong>norton</strong>: Perhaps we can find something more befitting
a man of your education.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Hey, Jake. Where’s Brooks?</p>
<p><strong>brooks</strong>: Andy! Thought I heard you out here!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I’ve been reassigned to you.</p>
<p><strong>brooks</strong>: I know, they told me. Ain’t that a kick in
the ass? Come on in, I’ll give you the dime tour.</p>
<p><strong>brooks</strong>: Here she is, the Shawshank Prison Library.
Along this side, we got the National Geographics. That side, the
Reader’s Digest Condensed books. Bottom shelf there, some Louis L’Amours
and Erle Stanley Gardners. Every night I pile the cart and make my
rounds. I write down the names on this clipboard here. Well, that’s it.
Easy, peasy, Japanesey. Any questions?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Brooks? How long have you been librarian?</p>
<p><strong>brooks</strong>: Since 1912. Yuh, over 37 years.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: In all that time, have you ever had an
assistant?</p>
<p><strong>brooks</strong>: Never needed one. Not much to it, is
there?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: So why now? Why me?</p>
<p><strong>brooks</strong>: I dunno. Be nice to have some comp’ny down
here for a change.</p>
<p><strong>hadley</strong>: Dufresne!</p>
<p><strong>91 andy steps back into the outer rooms and finds hadley with
91</strong>: another GUARD, a huge fellow named DEKINS.</p>
<p><strong>hadley</strong>: That’s him. That’s the one.</p>
<p><strong>dekins</strong>: I’m Dekins. I been, uh, thinkin’ ‘bout maybe
settin’ up some kinda trust fund for my kids’ educations.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I see. Well. Why don’t we have a seat and talk
it over?</p>
<p><strong>brooks</strong>: Pull down one’a them desks there.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: What did you have in mind? A weekly draw on
your pay?</p>
<p><strong>dekins</strong>: Yuh. I figured just stick it in the bank,
but Captain Hadley said check with you first.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: He was right. You don’t want your money in a
bank.</p>
<p><strong>dekins</strong>: I don’t?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: What’s that gonna earn you? Two and a half,
three percent a year? We can do a lot better than that. So tell me,
Mr. Dekins. Where do you want to send your kids? Harvard? Yale?</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: He didn’t say that!</p>
<p><strong>brooks</strong>: God is my witness. And Dekins, he just
blinks for a second, then laughs his ass off. Afterward, he actually
shook Andy’s hand.</p>
<p><strong>heywood</strong>: My ass!</p>
<p><strong>brooks</strong>: Shook his fuckin’ hand. Just about shit
myself. All Andy needed was a suit and tie, a jiggly little hula girl on
his desk, he would’a been Mister Dufresne, if you please.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Makin’ yourself some friends, Andy.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I wouldn’t say “friends.” I’m a convicted
murderer who provides sound financial planning. That’s a wonderful pet
to have.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Got you out of the laundry, didn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Maybe it can do more than that. How about
expanding the library? Get some new books in there.</p>
<p><strong>heywood</strong>: How you ’spect to do that,
“Mr. Dufresne-if-you-please?”</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Ask the warden for funds.</p>
<p><strong>brooks</strong>: Son, I’ve had six wardens through here
during my tenure, and I have learned one great immutable truth of the
universe: ain’t one of ’em been born whose asshole don’t pucker up tight
as a snare drum when you ask for funds.</p>
<p><strong>norton</strong>: Not a dime. My budget’s stretched thin as it
is.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I see. Perhaps I could write to the State
Senate and request funds directly from them.</p>
<p><strong>norton</strong>: Far as them Republican boys in Augusta are
concerned, there’s only three ways to spend the taxpayer’s hard-earned
when it come to prisons. More walls. More bars. More guards.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Still, I’d like to try, with your permission.
I’ll send a letter a week. They can’t ignore me forever.</p>
<p><strong>norton</strong>: They sure can, but you write your letters if
it makes you happy. I’ll even mail ’em for you, how’s that?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: So Andy started writing a letter a week, just
like he said.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: And just like Norton said, Andy got no answers.
But still he kept on.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: The following April, Andy did tax returns for
half the guards at Shawshank.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Year after that, he did them all… including the
warden’s.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Year after that, they rescheduled the start of
the intramural season to coincide with tax season…</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: The guards on the opposing teams all remembered
to bring their W-2’s.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Moresby Prison issued you that gun, but you
actually had to pay for it?</p>
<p><strong>the batter</strong>: Damn right, and the holster too.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: See, that’s all deductible. You get to write
that off.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Yes sir, Andy was a regular H&amp;R Block. In
fact, he got so busy at tax time, he was allowed a staff.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Say Red, could you hand me a stack of those
1040s?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Got me out of the wood shop a month out of the
year, and that was fine by me.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: And still he kept sending those letters…</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: Red? Andy? It’s Brooks.</p>
<p><strong>jigger</strong>: C’mon, Brooksie, why don’t you just calm the
fuck down, okay?</p>
<p><strong>brooks</strong>: Goddamn miserable puke-eatin’ sons of
whores!</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: What the hell’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>snooze</strong>: You tell me, man. One second he was fine,
then out came the knife. I better get the guards.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: No. We’ll handle this. Ain’t that right,
Brooks? Just settle down and we’ll talk about it, okay?</p>
<p><strong>brooks</strong>: Nothing left to talk about! It’s all talked
out! Nothing left now but to cut his fuckin’ throat!</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Why? What’s Heywood done to you?</p>
<p><strong>brooks</strong>: That’s what they want! It’s the price I
gotta pay!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Brooks, you’re not going to hurt Heywood, we
all know that. Even Heywood knows it, right Heywood?</p>
<p><strong>heywood</strong>: Sure. I know that. Sure.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Why? Ask anyone, they’ll tell you. Brooks
Hatlen is a reasonable man.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Yeah, that’s right. That’s what everybody
says.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You’re not fooling anybody, so just put the
damn knife down and stop scaring the shit out of people.</p>
<p><strong>brooks</strong>: But it’s the only way they’ll let me
stay.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Take it easy. You’ll be all right.</p>
<p><strong>heywood</strong>: Him? What about me? Crazy old fool! Goddamn
near slit my throat!</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: You’ve had worse from shaving. What’d you do to
set him off?</p>
<p><strong>heywood</strong>: Nothin’! Just came in to say
fare-thee-well. Ain’t you heard? His parole came through!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I just don’t understand what happened in
there, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>heywood</strong>: Old man’s crazy as a rat in a tin
shithouse, is what.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Heywood, enough. Ain’t nothing wrong with
Brooksie. He’s just institutionalized, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>heywood</strong>: Institutionalized, my ass.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Man’s been here fifty years. This place is all
he knows. In here, he’s an important man, an educated man. A librarian.
Out there, he’s nothing but a used-up old con with arthritis in both
hands. Couldn’t even get a library card if he applied. You see what I’m
saying?</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: Red, I do believe you’re talking out of your
ass.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Believe what you want. These walls are funny.
First you hate ’em, then you get used to ’em. After long enough, you get
so you depend on ’em. That’s “institutionalized.”</p>
<p><strong>jigger</strong>: Shit. I could never get that way.</p>
<p><strong>ernie</strong>: Say that when you been inside as long as
Brooks has.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Goddamn right. They send you here for life, and
that’s just what they take. Part that counts, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>brooks</strong>: I can’t take care of you no more. You go on
now. You’re free.</p>
<p><strong>brooks</strong>: Dear Fellas. I can’t believe how fast things
move on the outside.</p>
<p><strong>brooks</strong>: I saw an automobile once when I was young.
Now they’re everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>brooks</strong>: The world went and got itself in a big damn
hurry.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: No music in your room after eight p.m. No
guests after nine. No cooking except on the hotplate…</p>
<p><strong>brooks</strong>: People even talk faster. And louder.</p>
<p><strong>brooks</strong>: The parole board got me into this halfway
house called the Brewster, and a job bagging groceries at the
Foodway…</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Make sure he double-bags. Last time your man
didn’t double-bag and the bottom near came out.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: You double-bag like the lady says,
understand?</p>
<p><strong>brooks</strong>: Yes sir, double-bag, surely will.</p>
<p><strong>brooks</strong>: It’s hard work. I try to keep up, but my
hands hurt most of the time. I don’t think the store manager likes me
very much.</p>
<p><strong>brooks</strong>: Sometimes after work I go to the park and
feed the birds. I keep thinking Jake might show up and say hello, but he
never does. I hope wherever he is, he’s doing okay and making new
friends.</p>
<p><strong>brooks</strong>: I have trouble sleeping at night. The bed is
too big. I have bad dreams, like I’m falling. I wake up scared.
Sometimes it takes me a while to remember where I am.</p>
<p><strong>brooks</strong>: Maybe I should get me a gun and rob the
Foodway, so they’d send me home. I could shoot the manager while I was
at it, sort of like a bonus.</p>
<p><strong>brooks</strong>: But I guess I’m too old for that sort of
nonsense anymore.</p>
<p><strong>brooks</strong>: I don’t like it here. I’m tired of being
afraid all the time. I’ve decided not to stay.</p>
<p><strong>brooks</strong>: I doubt they’ll kick up any fuss. Not for an
old crook like me.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: P.S. Tell Heywood I’m sorry I put a knife to
his throat. No hard feelings.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: He should’a died in here, goddamn it.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Red!</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Is that Jake?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: It never would have occurred to us, if not for
Andy. It was his idea. We all agreed it was the right thing to do…</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Water break! Five minutes!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: That’s real pretty, Red. Nice work.</p>
<p><strong>heywood</strong>: Shovel man in. Watch the dirt.</p>
<p><strong>124 continued 124</strong>: Heywood jumps in and starts
spading out the hole.</p>
<p><strong>youngblood</strong>: What the fuck.</p>
<p><strong>hadley</strong>: What am I, talkin’ to myself?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Lord. Brooks was a sinner. Jake was just a
crow. Neither was much to look at. Both got institutionalized. See what
you can do for ’em. Amen.</p>
<p><strong>hadley</strong>: Dufresne! What the fuck did you do? Your
ass, warden’s office, now!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: What is all this?</p>
<p><strong>hadley</strong>: You tell me, fuck-stick! They’re addressed
to you, every damn one!</p>
<p><strong>wiley</strong>: Well, take it.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Dear Mr. Dufresne. In response to your
repeated inquiries, the State Senate has allocated the enclosed funds
for your library project… ” This is two hundred dollars.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: In addition, the Library District has
generously responded with a charitable donation of used books and
sundries. We trust this will fill your needs. We now consider the matter
closed. Please stop sending us letters. Yours truly, the State
Comptroller’s Office.</p>
<p><strong>hadley</strong>: I want all this cleared out before the
warden gets back, I shit you not.</p>
<p><strong>wiley</strong>: Good for you, Andy.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Only took six years. From now on, I send two
letters a week instead of one.</p>
<p><strong>wiley</strong>: I believe you’re crazy enough. You better get
this stuff downstairs like the Captain said. I’m gonna go pinch a loaf.
When I get back, this is all gone, right?</p>
<p><strong>wiley</strong>: Andy? You hear that?</p>
<p><strong>140 the motor pool…the kitchen…the loading dock…the exercise
140</strong>: thru yard…the numbing routine of prison life itself…all
grinds thru</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: I have no idea to this day what them two
Italian ladies were singin’ about. Truth is, I don’t want to know. Some
things are best left unsaid. I like to think they were singin’ about
something so beautiful it can’t be expressed in words, and makes your
heart ache because of it.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: I tell you, those voices soared. Higher and
farther than anybody in a gray place dares to dream. It was like some
beautiful bird flapped into our drab little cage and made these walls
dissolve away…and for the briefest of moments – every last man at
Shawshank felt free.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: It pissed the warden off something
terrible.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Andy got two weeks in the hole for that little
stunt.</p>
<p><strong>heywood</strong>: Couldn’t play somethin’ good, huh? Hank
Williams?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: They broke the door down before I could take
requests.</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: Was it worth two weeks in the hole?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Easiest time I ever did.</p>
<p><strong>heywood</strong>: Shit. No such thing as easy time in the
hole. A week seems like a year.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I had Mr. Mozart to keep me company. Hardly
felt the time at all.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Oh, they let you tote that record player down
there, huh? I could’a swore they confiscated that stuff.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: The music was here…and here. That’s the one
thing they can’t confiscate, not ever. That’s the beauty of it. Haven’t
you ever felt that way about music, Red?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Played a mean harmonica as a younger man. Lost
my taste for it. Didn’t make much sense on the inside.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Here’s where it makes most sense. We need it
so we don’t forget.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Forget?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: That there are things in this world not carved
out of gray stone. That there’s a small place inside of us they can
never lock away, and that place is called hope.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Hope is a dangerous thing. Drive a man insane.
It’s got no place here. Better get used to the idea.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Like Brooks did?</p>
<p><strong>man #2</strong>: You feel you’ve been rehabilitated?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Yes sir, without a doubt. I can say I’m a
changed man. No danger to society, that’s the God’s honest truth.
Absolutely rehabilitated.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Same old, same old. Thirty years. Jesus. When
you say it like that…</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You wonder where it went. I wonder where ten
years went.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Anniversary gift. Open it.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Had to go through one of your competitors.
Hope you don’t mind. Wanted it to be a surprise.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: It’s very pretty, Andy. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You gonna play something?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Not today.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Andy was as good as his word. He kept writing
to the State Senate. Two letters a week instead of one.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: In 1959, the folks up Augusta way finally clued
in to the fact they couldn’t buy him off with just a 200 dollar check.
Appropriations Committee voted an annual payment of 500 dollars, just to
shut him up.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Those checks came once a year like
clockwork.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: You’d be amazed how far Andy could stretch it.
He made deals with book clubs, charity groups…he bought remaindered
books by the pound…</p>
<p><strong>heywood</strong>: Treasure Island. Robert Louis…</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: …Stevenson. Next?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: I got here an auto repair manual, and a book on
soap carving.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Trade skills and hobbies, those go under
educational. Stack right behind you.</p>
<p><strong>heywood</strong>: The Count of Monte Crisco…</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: Cristo, you dumbshit.</p>
<p><strong>heywood</strong>: …by Alexandree Dumb-ass.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Dumas. You boys’ll like that one. It’s about a
prison break.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Maybe that should go under educational too.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: By the year Kennedy was shot, Andy had
transformed a broom closet smelling of turpentine into the best prison
library in New England.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: That was also the year Warden Norton instituted
his famous “Inside-Out” program. You may remember reading about it. It
made all the papers and got his picture in LIFE magazine.</p>
<p><strong>norton</strong>: …a genuine, progressive advance in
corrections and rehabilitation. Our inmates, properly supervised, will
be put to work outside these walls performing all manner of public
service. Cutting pulpwood, repairing bridges and causeways, digging
storm drains…</p>
<p><strong>norton</strong>: These men can learn the value of an honest
day’s labor while providing a valuable service to the community – and at
a bare minimum of expense to Mr. and Mrs. John Q. Taxpayer!</p>
<p><strong>heywood</strong>: Sounds like road-gangin’, you ask me.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Nobody asked you.</p>
<p><strong>woman reporter</strong>: You there! You men! We’re gonna take
your picture now!</p>
<p><strong>heywood</strong>: Give us a break, lady.</p>
<p><strong>woman reporter</strong>: Don’t you know who I am? I’m from
LIFE magazine! I was told I’d get some co-operation out here! You want
me to report you to your warden? Is that what you want?</p>
<p><strong>heywood</strong>: No, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>woman reporter</strong>: That’s more like it! Now I want you
all in a row with big bright smiles on your faces! Grab hold of your
tools and show ’em to me!</p>
<p><strong>heywood</strong>: You heard the lady.</p>
<p><strong>heywood</strong>: C’mon! We’re showin’ our tools and grinnin’
like fools! Take the damn picture!</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: None of the inmates were invited to express
their views…</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: ’Course, Norton failed to mention to the press
that “bare minimum of expense” is a fairly loose term. There are a
hundred different ways to skim off the top. Men, materials, you name it.
And, oh my Lord, how the money rolled in…</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: This keeps up, you’re gonna put me out of
business! With this pool of slave labor you got, you can underbid any
contractor in town.</p>
<p><strong>norton</strong>: Ned, we’re providing a valuable community
service.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: That’s fine for the papers, but I got a family
to feed. The State don’t pay my salary. Sam, we go back a long way. I
need this new highway contract. I don’t get it, I go under. That’s a
fact. Now you just have some’a this fine pie my missus baked specially
for you, and you think about that.</p>
<p><strong>norton</strong>: Ned, I wouldn’t worry too much over this
contract. Seems to me I’ve already got my boys committed elsewhere. You
be sure and thank Maisie for this fine pie.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: And behind every shady deal, behind every
dollar earned…</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: …there was Andy, keeping the books.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Two deposits, Casco Bank and New England
First. Night drop, like always.</p>
<p><strong>norton</strong>: Get my stuff down t’laundry. Two suits for
dry-clean and a bag of whatnot. Tell ’em if they over- starch my shirts
again, they’re gonna hear about it from me. How do I look?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Very nice.</p>
<p><strong>norton</strong>: Big charity to-do up Portland way.
Governor’s gonna be there. Want the rest of that? Woman can’t bake worth
shit.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Got his fingers in a lot of pies, from what I
hear.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: What you hear isn’t half of it. He’s got scams
you haven’t dreamed of. Kickbacks on his kickbacks. There’s a river of
dirty money flowing through this place.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Money like that can be a problem. Sooner or
later you gotta explain where it came from.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: That’s where I come in. I channel it, funnel
it, filter it…stocks, securities, tax free municipals… I send that money
out into the big world. And when it comes back…</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: It’s clean as a virgin’s whistle?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Cleaner. By the time Norton retires, I will
have made him a millionaire.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Jesus. They ever catch on, he’s gonna wind up
wearing a number himself.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I thought you had more faith in me than
that.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: I’m sure you’re good, but all that paper leaves
a trail. Anybody gets too curious – FBI, IRS, whatever – that trail’s
gonna lead to somebody.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Sure it will. But not to me, and certainly not
to the warden.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Who then?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Peter Stevens.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: The silent, silent partner. He’s the guilty
one, your Honor. The man with the bank accounts. That’s where the
filtering process starts. They trace it back, all they’re gonna find is
him.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Yeah, okay, but who the hell is he?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: A phantom. An apparition. Second cousin to
Harvey the Rabbit. I conjured him out of thin air. He doesn’t
exist…except on paper.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: You can’t just make a person up.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Sure you can, if you know how the system
works, and where the cracks are. It’s amazing what you can accomplish by
mail. Mr. Stevens has a birth certificate, social security card,
driver’s license. They ever track those accounts, they’ll wind up
chasing a figment of my imagination.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Jesus. Did I say you were good? You’re
Rembrandt.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: It’s funny. On the outside, I was an honest
man. Straight as an arrow. I had to come to prison to be a crook.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Does it ever bother you?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I don’t run the scams, Red, I just process the
profits. That’s a fine line, maybe. But I’ve also built that library,
and used it to help a dozen guys get their high school diplomas. Why do
you think the warden lets me do all that?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: To keep you happy and doing the laundry. Money
instead of sheets.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I work cheap. That’s the trade-off.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Well. Ain’t this for shit?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Tommy Williams came to Shawshank in 1965 on a
two year stretch for B&amp;E. Cops caught him sneakin’ TV sets out the
back door of a JC Penney.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Young punk, Mr. Rock n’ Roll, cocky as
hell…</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: C’mon there, old boys! Movin’ like molasses!
Makin’ me look bad!</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: We liked him immediately.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: …so I’m backin’ out the door, right? Had the
TV like this… Big ol’ thing. Couldn’t see shit. Suddenly, here’s this
voice: Freeze kid! Hands in the air! Well I just stand there holdin’ on
to that TV, so the voice says: “You hear what I said, boy?” And I say,
Yes sir, I sure did! But if I drop this fuckin’ thing, you got me on
destruction of property too!</p>
<p><strong>heywood</strong>: You did a stretch in Cashman too?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Yeah. That was an easy ride, let me tell you.
Work programs, weekend furloughs. Not like here.</p>
<p><strong>snooze</strong>: Sounds like you done time all over New
England.</p>
<p><strong>tomny</strong>: Been in and out since I was 13. Name the
place, chances are I been there.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Perhaps it’s time you considered a new
profession. What I mean is, you don’t seem to be a very good thief.
Maybe you should try something else.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: What the hell you know about it, Capone? What
are you in for?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Everyone’s innocent in here. Don’t you know
that?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: As it turns out, Tommy had himself a young wife
and new baby girl…</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: …said we can stay with them, but Joey’s
gettin’ out of the service next month, and they barely got enough room
as it is. Plus they got Poppa workin’ double shifts and the baby cries
half the night. I just don’t know where we’re gonna go…</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Maybe it was the thought of them on</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Whatever it was, something lit a fire under
that boy’s ass.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I’m thinkin’ maybe I should try for high
school equivalency. Hear you helped some fellas with that.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I don’t waste time on losers, Tommy.</p>
<p><strong>tomny</strong>: I ain’t no goddamn loser.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: That’s a good start. If we do this, we do it
all the way. One hundred percent. Nothing half-assed.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Thing is, see… …I don’t read all that
good.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Well. You’ve come to the right place then.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: …and the lamplight o’er him streaming throws
his shadow on the floor…and my soul from out that shadow that lies
floating on the floor, shall be lifted nevermore! ”</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: So this raven just sits there and won’t go
away?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Why don’t that fella get hisself a 12-gauge
and dust the fucker?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: The cat sh–The cat shh… The cat shat on the
welcome mat?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: So Andy took Tommy under his wing. Started
walking him through his ABCs…</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Tommy took to it pretty well, too. Boy found
brains he never knew he had.</p>
<p><strong>tomny</strong>: The cat sh–shh–shimmied up the tree and crept
st–stel–stealthily out on the limb…</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: After a while, you couldn’t pry those books out
of hands.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Ass in gear, son! You’re putting us behind!</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Before long, Andy started him on his course
requirements. He really liked the kid, that was part of it. Gave him a
thrill to help a youngster crawl off the shitheap. But that wasn’t the
only reason…</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Prison time is slow time. Sometimes it feels
like stop-time. So you do what you can to keep going…</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Some fellas collect stamps. Others build
matchstick houses. Andy built a library. Now he needed a new project.
Tommy was it. It was the same reason he spent years shaping and
polishing those rocks. The same reason he hung his fantasy girlies on
the wall…</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: In prison, a man’ll do most anything to keep
his mind occupied.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: By 1966…right about the time Tommy was getting
ready to take his exams…it was lovely Racquel.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Well. It’s for shit. Wasted a whole fuckin’
year of my time with this bullshit!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: May not be as bad as you think.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: It’s worse! I didn’t get a fuckin’ thing
right! Might as well be in Chinese!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: We’ll see how the score comes out.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I’ll tell you how the goddamn score comes
out…</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Two points! Right there! There’s your goddamn
score! Goddamn cats crawlin’ up trees, 5 times 5 is 25, fuck this place,
fuck it!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I feel bad. I let him down.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: That’s crap, son. He’s proud of you. Proud as a
hen. We been friends a long time. I know him as good as anybody.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Smart fella, ain’t he?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Smart as they come. Used to be a banker on the
outside.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: What’s he in for anyway?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Murder.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: The hell you say.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: You wouldn’t think, lookin’ at him. Caught his
wife in bed with some golf pro. Greased ’em both. C’mon, boy, back to
work…</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Oh my God…</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: ‘Bout four years ago, I was in Thomaston on a
2 to 3 stretch. Stole a car. Dumbfuck thing to do. Few months left to
go, I get a new cellmate in. Elmo Blatch. Big twitchy fucker. Crazy
eyes. Kind of roomie you pray you don’t get, know what I’m sayin’? 6 to
12 for armed burglary. Said he done hundreds of jobs. Hard to believe,
high-strung as he was. Cut a loud fart, he’d go three feet in the air.
Talked all the time, too, that’s the other thing. Never shut up. Places
he’d been, jobs he pulled, women he fucked. Even people he killed.
People that gave him shit, that’s how he put it. One night, like a joke,
I say: “Yeah? Who’d you kill?” So he says…</p>
<p><strong>blatch</strong>: …I got me this job one time bussin’ tables
at a country club. So I could case all the big rich pricks that come in.
I pick out this guy, go in one night and do his place. He wakes up and
gives me shit. So I killed him. Him and the tasty bitch he was with.
That’s the best part! She’s fuckin’ this prick, see, this golf pro, but
she’s married to some other guy! Some hotshot banker. He’s the one they
pinned it on! They got him down-Maine somewhere doin’ time for the
crime! Ain’t that choice?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Andy?</p>
<p><strong>norton</strong>: Well. I have to say, that’s the most amazing
story I ever heard. What amazes me most is you were taken in by it.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>norton</strong>: It’s obvious this fellow Williams is
impressed with you. He hears your tale of woe and quite naturally wants
to cheer you up. He’s young, not terribly bright. Not surprising he
didn’t know what a state he’d put you in.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I think he’s telling the truth.</p>
<p><strong>norton</strong>: Let’s say for a moment Blatch does exist.
You think he’d just fall to his knees and cry, “Yes, I did it! I
confess! By all means, please add a life term to my sentence!”</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: It wouldn’t matter. With Tommy’s testimony, I
can get a new trial.</p>
<p><strong>norton</strong>: That’s assuming Blatch is even still there.
Chances are excellent he’d be released by now. Excellent.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: They’d have his last known address. Names of
relatives… Well it’s a chance. isn’t it? How can you be so obtuse?</p>
<p><strong>norton</strong>: What? What did you call me?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Obtuse! Is it deliberate? The country club
will have his old time cards! W-2s with his name on them!</p>
<p><strong>norton</strong>: Dufresne, if you want to indulge this
fantasy, that’s your business. Don’t make it mine. This meeting’s
over.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Look, if it’s the squeeze, don’t worry. I’d
never say what goes on in here. I’d be just as indictable as you for
laundering the money!</p>
<p><strong>norton</strong>: Don’t you ever mention money to me again,
you sorry son of a bitch! Not in this office, not anywhere! Get in here!
Now!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I was just trying to rest your mind at ease,
that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>norton</strong>: Solitary! A month!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: What’s the matter with you? It’s my chance to
get out, don’t you see that? It’s my life! Don’t you understand it’s my
life?</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: A month in the hole. Longest damn stretch I
ever heard of.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: It’s my fault.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Like hell. You didn’t pull the trigger, and you
didn’t convict him.</p>
<p><strong>heywood</strong>: Red? You saying Andy’s innocent? I mean for
real innocent? Sweet Jesus. How long’s he been in here?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Since ’47. Going on nineteen years.</p>
<p><strong>mail caller</strong>: Thomas Williams!</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Board of Education.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: The son of a bitch mailed it.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Looks that way. You gonna open it or stick your
thumb up your butt?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Thumb up my butt sounds better.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: C’mon, just throw it away. Will you please?
Just throw it away?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Well, shit.</p>
<p><strong>elderly guard</strong>: Kid passed. C-plus average. Thought
you’d like to know.</p>
<p><strong>mert</strong>: Warden wants to talk.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Out here?</p>
<p><strong>mert</strong>: That’s what the man said.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Warden?</p>
<p><strong>norton</strong>: Tommy, we’ve got a situation here. I think
you can appreciate that.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Yes sir, I sure can.</p>
<p><strong>norton</strong>: I tell you, son, this really came along and
knocked my wind out. It’s got me up nights, that’s the truth.</p>
<p><strong>norton</strong>: The right decision. Sometimes it’s hard to
figure out what that is. You understand? Think hard, Tommy. If I’m gonna
move on this, there can’t be the least little shred of doubt. I have to
know if you what you told Dufresne was the truth.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Yes sir. Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>norton</strong>: Would you be willing to swear before a judge
and jury…having placed your hand on the Good Book and taken an oath
before Almighty God Himself?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Just gimme that chance.</p>
<p><strong>norton</strong>: That’s what I thought.</p>
<p><strong>norton</strong>: Terrible thing. Man that young, less than a
year to go, trying to escape. Broke Captain Hadley’s heart to shoot him,
truly it did.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I’m done. It stops right now. Get H&amp;R
Block to declare your income.</p>
<p><strong>norton</strong>: Nothing stops! NOTHING! Or you will do the
hardest time there is. No more protection from the guards. I’ll pull you
out of that one-bunk Hilton and put you in</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: My wife used to say I’m a hard man to know.
Like a closed book. Complained about it all the time. She was beautiful.
I loved her. But I guess I couldn’t show it enough. I killed her,
Red.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I didn’t pull the trigger. But I drove her
away. That’s why she died. Because of me, the way I am.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: That don’t make you a murderer. Bad husband,
maybe.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Feel bad about it if you want. But you didn’t
pull the trigger.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: No. I didn’t. Someone else did, and I wound up
here. Bad luck, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Bad luck? Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: It floats around. Has to land on somebody. Say
a storm comes through. Some folks sit in their living rooms and enjoy
the rain. The house next door gets torn out of the ground and smashed
flat. It was my turn, that’s all. I was in the path of the tornado. I
just had no idea the storm would go on as long as it has. Think you’ll
ever get out of here?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Sure. When I got a long white beard and about
three marbles left rolling around upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Tell you where I’d go. Zihuatanejo.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Zihuatanejo?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Mexico. Little place right on the Pacific. You
know what the Mexicans say about the Pacific? They say it has no memory.
That’s where I’d like to finish out my life, Red. A warm place with no
memory. Open a little hotel right on the beach. Buy some worthless old
boat and fix it up like new. Take my guests out charter fishing. You
know, a place like that, I’d need a man who can get things.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Jesus, Andy. I couldn’t hack it on the outside.
Been in here too long. I’m an institutional man now. Like old Brooks
Hatlen was.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You underestimate yourself.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Bullshit. In here I’m the guy who can get it
for you. Out there, all you need are Yellow Pages. I wouldn’t know where
to begin. Pacific Ocean? Hell. Like to scare me to death, somethin’ that
big.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Not me. I didn’t shoot my wife and I didn’t
shoot her lover, and whatever mistakes I made I’ve paid for and then
some. That hotel and that boat…I don’t think it’s too much to want. To
look at the stars just after sunset. Touch the sand. Wade in the water.
Feel free.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Goddamn it, Andy, stop! Don’t do that to
yourself! Talking shitty pipedreams! Mexico’s down there, and you’re in
here, and that’s the way it is!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You’re right. It’s down there, and I’m in
here. I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really. Get busy living
or get busy dying.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Andy?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Red, if you ever get out of here, do me a
favor. There’s this big hayfield up near Buxton. You know where Buxton
is?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Lots of hayfields there.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: One in particular. Got a long rock wall with a
big oak at the north end. Like something out of a Robert Frost poem.
It’s where I asked my</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: What? What’s buried there?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You’ll just have to pry up that rock and
see.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: I tell you, the man was talkin’ crazy. I’m
worried, I truly am.</p>
<p><strong>skeet</strong>: We ought to keep an eye on him.</p>
<p><strong>jigger</strong>: That’s fine, during the day. But at night
he’s got that cell all to himself.</p>
<p><strong>heywood</strong>: Oh Lord. Andy come down to the loading dock
today. Asked me for a length of rope. Six foot long.</p>
<p><strong>snooze</strong>: Shit! You gave it to him?</p>
<p><strong>heywood</strong>: Sure I did. I mean why wouldn’t I?</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: Christ! Remember Brooks Hatlen?</p>
<p><strong>heywood</strong>: How the hell was I s’pose to know?</p>
<p><strong>jigger</strong>: Andy’d never do that. Never.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Every man’s got a breaking point.</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: Where the hell is he?</p>
<p><strong>heywood</strong>: Probably still up in the warden’s.</p>
<p><strong>skeet</strong>: Christ. What do we do?</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: Nothing we can do. Not tonight.</p>
<p><strong>heywood</strong>: Let’s pull him aside tomorrow, all of us.
Have a word with him. Ain’t that right, Red?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Yeah. Sure. That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>norton</strong>: Lickety-split. I wanna get home.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Just about done, sir.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Three deposits tonight.</p>
<p><strong>norton</strong>: Get my stuff down t’laundry. And shine my
shoes. I want ‘em lookin’ like mirrors. Nice havin’ you back, Andy.
Place just wasn’t the same without you.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Open number twelve!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Lights out!</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: I have had some long nights in stir. Alone in
the dark with nothing but your thoughts, time can draw out like a
blade…</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: That was the longest night of my life…</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Man missing on tier two! Cell 12!</p>
<p><strong>haig</strong>: Dufresne? Get your ass out here, boy! You’re
holding up the show! Don’t make me come down there now! I’ll thump your
skull for you!</p>
<p><strong>haig</strong>: Dufresne, dammit, you’re putting me behind!
You better be sick or dead in there, I shit you not!</p>
<p><strong>norton</strong>: I want every man on that cellblock
questioned! Start with that friend of his!</p>
<p><strong>hadley</strong>: who?</p>
<p><strong>norton</strong>: Him.</p>
<p><strong>norton</strong>: What do you mean “he just wasn’t here?”
Don’t say that to me, Haig! Don’t say that to me again!</p>
<p><strong>haig</strong>: But sir! He wasn’t! He isn’t!</p>
<p><strong>norton</strong>: I can see that, Haig! You think I’m blind?
Is that what you’re saying? Am I blind, Haig?</p>
<p><strong>haig</strong>: No sir!</p>
<p><strong>norton</strong>: What about you? You blind? Tell me what this
is!</p>
<p><strong>hadley</strong>: Last night’s count.</p>
<p><strong>norton</strong>: You see Dufresne’s name? I sure do! Right
there, see? “Dufresne.” He was in his cell at lights out! Stands to
reason he’d still be here this morning! I want him found! Not tomorrow,
not after breakfast! Now!</p>
<p><strong>norton</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Well what?</p>
<p><strong>norton</strong>: I see you two all the time, you’re thick as
thieves, you are! He must’a said something!</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: No sir, he didn’t!</p>
<p><strong>norton</strong>: Lord! It’s a miracle! Man up and vanished
like a fart in the wind! Nothin’ left but some damn rocks on the
windowsill and that cupcake on the wall! Let’s ask her! Maybe she knows!
What say there, Fuzzy- Britches? Feel like talking? Guess not. Why
should you be different?</p>
<p><strong>norton</strong>: It’s a conspiracy! That’s what this is! It’s
one big damn conspiracy! And everyone’s in on it! Including her!</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: They got this skinny kid named Rory Tremont to
go in the hole. He wasn’t much in the brains department, but he
possessed the one most important qualification for the job… …he was
willing to go.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Probably thought he’d win a Bronze Star or
something.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: It was his third day on the job.</p>
<p><strong>rory</strong>: Warden? There’s a space here between the walls
’bout three feet across! Smells pretty damn bad!</p>
<p><strong>norton</strong>: I don’t care what it smells like!</p>
<p><strong>hadley</strong>: Go on, boy! We got a hold of you!</p>
<p><strong>rory</strong>: Hoo-whee! Smell’s gettin’ worse!</p>
<p><strong>norton</strong>: Never mind, I said! Just keep going!</p>
<p><strong>rory</strong>: Smells pretty damn bad, Warden! In fact, it
smells just like shit.</p>
<p><strong>rory</strong>: Oh God, that’s what it is, it’s shit. oh my
God it’s shit. pull me out ’fore I blow my groceries, oh shit it’s shit,
oh my Gawwwwwwd!</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: And then came the unmistakable sound of Rory
Tremont losing his last few meals. The whole cellblock heard it. I mean,
it echoed.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: I laughed myself right into solitary. Two week
stretch.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: It’s shit, it’s shit, oh my God it’s shit…</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Andy once talked about doing easy time in the
hole. Now I knew what he meant.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: In 1966, Andy Dufresne escaped from Shawshank
Prison.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: All they found of him was a muddy set of prison
clothes, a bar of soap, and an old rock-hammer damn near worn down to
the nub.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: I remember thinking it would take a man six
hundred years to tunnel through the wall with it. Andy did it in less
than twenty.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Andy loved geology. I imagine it appealed to
his meticulous nature. An ice age here, a million years of
mountain-building there, plates of bedrock grinding against each other
over a span of millennia…</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Geology is the study of pressure and time.
That’s all it takes, really. Pressure and time.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: That and a big damn poster.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Like I said. In prison, a man’ll do most
anything to keep his mind occupied.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: It turns out Andy’s favorite hobby was totin’
his wall out into the exercise yard a handful at a time…</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: While the rest of us slept, Andy spent years
workin’ the nightshift…</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Probably took him most of a year just to get
his head through.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: I guess after Tommy was killed, Andy decided
he’d been here just about long enough.</p>
<p><strong>norton</strong>: Lickety-split. I wanna get home.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Just about done, sir.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Andy did like he was told. Buffed those shoes
to a high mirror shine.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: The guard simply didn’t notice. Neither did I.
I mean, seriously, how often do you really look at a man’s shoes?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Andy crawled to freedom through five hundred
yards of shit-smelling foulness I can’t even imagine. Or maybe I just
don’t want to.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Five hundred yards. The length of five football
fields. Just shy of half a mile.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: The next morning, right about the time Racquel
was spilling her little secret…</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: …a man nobody ever laid eyes on before strolled
into the Casco Bank of Portland. Until that moment, he didn’t exist –
except on paper.</p>
<p><strong>female teller</strong>: May I help you?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: My name is Peter Stevens. I’ve come to close
out some accounts.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: He had all the proper I.D. Driver’s license,
birth certificate, social security card. The signature was a spot-on
match.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Thank you. I’m sure I will.</p>
<p><strong>teller</strong>: Here’s your cashier’s check, sir. Will there
be anything else?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Please. Would you add this to your outgoing
mail?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Mr. Stevens visited nearly a dozen banks in the
Portland area that morning. All told, he blew town with better than 370
thousand dollars of Warden Norton’s money. Severance pay for nineteen
years.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Hal! Dave! Get your butts in here!</p>
<p><strong>d.a.</strong>: Byron Hadley?</p>
<p><strong>d.a.</strong>: You have the right to remain silent. If you
give up that right, anything you say will be used against you in
court…</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: I wasn’t there to see it, but I hear Byron
Hadley was sobbing like a little girl when they took him away.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Norton had no intention of goin’ that
quietly.</p>
<p><strong>d.a.</strong>: Samuel Norton? We have a warrant for your
arrest! Open up!</p>
<p><strong>duty guard</strong>: I’m not sure which one it is…</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: I like to think the last thing that went
through his head…other than that bullet…was to wonder how the hell Andy
Dufresne ever got the best of him.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Not long after the warden deprived us of his
company, I got a postcard in the mail. It was blank. But the postmark
said, “McNary, Texas.”</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: McNary. Right on the border. That’s where Andy
crossed. When I picture him heading south in his own car with the top
down, it makes me laugh all over again…</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Andy Dufresne, who crawled through a river of
shit and came out clean on the other side. Andy Dufresne, headed for the
Pacific.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Those of us who knew him best talk about him
often. I swear, the stuff he pulled. It always makes us laugh.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Sometimes it makes me sad, though, Andy being
gone. I have to remind myself that some birds aren’t meant to be caged,
that’s all. Their feathers are just too bright…</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: …and when they fly away, the part of you that
knows it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice…but still, the place you
live is that much more drab and empty that they’re gone.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: I guess I just miss my friend.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: But there are times I curse him for the dreams
he left behind…</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: …dreams where I am lost in a warm place with no
memory.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: An ocean so big it strikes me dumb. Waves so
quiet they strike me deaf. Sunshine so bright it strikes me blind. It is
a place that is blue beyond reason. Bluer than can possibly exist. Bluer
than my mind can possibly grasp.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: I am terrified. There is no way home.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Andy. I know you’re in that place. Look at the
stars for me just after sunset. Touch the sand…wade in the water…and
feel free.</p>
<p><strong>man #1</strong>: Your file says you’ve served forty years of
a life sentence. You feel you’ve been rehabilitated?</p>
<p><strong>man #1</strong>: Shall I repeat the question?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: I heard you. Rehabilitated. Let’s see now. You
know, come to think of it, I have no idea what that means.</p>
<p><strong>man #2</strong>: Well, it means you’re ready to rejoin
society as a–</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: I know what you think it means. Me, I think
it’s a made-up word, a poli- tician’s word. A word so young fellas like
you can wear a suit and tie and have a job. What do you really want to
know? Am I sorry for what I did?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Not a day goes by I don’t feel regret, and not
because I’m in here or because you think I should. I look back on myself
the way I was…stupid kid who did that terrible crime…wish I could talk
sense to him. Tell him how things are. But I can’t. That kid’s long
gone, this old man is all that’s left, and I have to live with that.
Rehabilitated? That’s a bullshit word, so you just go on ahead and stamp
that form there, sonny, and stop wasting my damn time. Truth is, I don’t
give a shit.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Sir? Restroom break sir?</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: You don’t need to ask me every time you go
take a piss. Just go. Understand?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Thirty years I’ve been asking permission to
piss. I can’t squeeze a drop without say-so.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Women, too, that’s the other thing. I forgot
they were half the human race. There’s women everywhere, every shape and
size. I find myself semi-hard most of the time, cursing myself for a
dirty old man.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Not a brassiere to be seen, nipples poking out
at the world. Jeezus, pleeze-us. Back in my day, a woman out in public
like that would have been arrested and given a sanity hearing.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: They’re calling this the Summer of Love. Summer
of Loonies, you ask me.</p>
<p><strong>p.o.</strong>: You staying out of the bars, Red?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Yes sir. That I am.</p>
<p><strong>p.o.</strong>: How you doing otherwise? Adjusting okay?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Things got different out here.</p>
<p><strong>p.o.</strong>: Tell me about it. Young punks protesting the
war. You imagine? Even my own kid. Oughtta bust his fuckin’ skull.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Guess the world moved on.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: There is a harsh truth to face. No way I’m
gonna make it on the outside.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: All I do anymore is think of ways to break my
parole.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Terrible thing, to live in fear. Brooks Hatlen
knew it. Knew it all too well. All I want is to be back where things
make sense. Where I won’t have to be afraid all the time.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Only one thing stops me. A promise I made to
Andy.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Dear Red. If you’re reading this, you’ve
gotten out. And if you’ve come this far, maybe you’re willing to come a
little further. You remember the name of the town, don’t you? I could
use a good man to help me get my project on wheels. I’ll keep an eye out
for you and the chessboard ready. Remember, Red. Hope is a good thing,
maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies. I will be hoping
that this letter finds you, and finds you well. Your friend. Andy.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Get busy living or get busy dying. That is
goddamn right.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: For the second time in my life, I am guilty of
committing a crime.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Parole violation. I doubt they’ll toss up any
roadblocks for that. Not for an old crook like me.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: McNary, Texas?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: I find I am so excited I can barely sit still
or hold a thought in my head. I think it is the excitement only a free
man can feel, a free man at the start of a long journey whose conclusion
is uncertain…</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: I hope I can make it across the border. I hope
to see my friend and shake his hand. I hope the Pacific is as blue as it
has been in my dreams. I hope.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You look like a man who knows how to get
things.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: I’m known to locate certain things from time to
time.</p>
