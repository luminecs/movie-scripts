<p><strong>chief</strong>: This is it.</p>
<p><strong>lanky</strong>: Why did it have to be these caves…</p>
<p><strong>college boy</strong>: Is something wrong?</p>
<p><strong>lanky</strong>: Don’t mind me, buddy. It’s nothin’.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Let’s get that first barrel.</p>
<p><strong>college boy</strong>: What’s with the awkward silence?</p>
<p><strong>lanky</strong>: You don’t know?</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Last winter, a man kidnapped a little girl
and holed up in one of these caves. The cops had him pinned down and
began to move in. This guy started shooting… but he wasn’t aiming at the
officers… …he was firing at something inside.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: When the dust cleared, all they found was the
little girl’s shoes. With the feet still in ’em.</p>
<p><strong>college boy</strong>: Ahh!!!</p>
<p><strong>college boy</strong>: Assholes.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Hey, relax, I nearly shit myself when my boss
pulled that one on me.</p>
<p><strong>lanky</strong>: I went well beyond nearly.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>college boy</strong>: Once was plenty, fellas.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Shhhh…</p>
<p><strong>mean green</strong>: Stop it right there! You will not rape
Mother Nature one more day!</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!</p>
<p><strong>hippie group</strong>: Mother Nature is not a whore/Don’t
dump in her any-more/Mother Nature is not a whore/Don’t dump in her any-
more…</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Take it easy! We have a permit!</p>
<p><strong>mean green</strong>: And we have an injunction from the State
to prevent any dumping in these caverns! This is virgin land! The
aqueducts in these caves bring drinking water to our families, and its
piping provides drainage for our farms that enrich this barren land! And
it won’t be tainted by waste of any kind! Not now! Not ever!</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Fine, just back off!</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Let’s roll… Now-now-now!</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: How do you guys always know where we’re
going?</p>
<p><strong>mean green</strong>: I’ll tell ya next time! NOW MOVE IT!</p>
<p><strong>mean green</strong>: Score one for the green team!!!</p>
<p><strong>bearded cameraman</strong>: Hey, man, that was righteous, but
I need a shot with the sign up.</p>
<p><strong>mean green</strong>: We saved you today, ol’ gal.</p>
<p><strong>fuzzy</strong>: Oh, fuck!</p>
<p><strong>mean green</strong>: Sister, why do you always swing for the
fences?</p>
<p><strong>fuzzy</strong>: It’s okay, but I… I think I see something in
there… something shiny.</p>
<p><strong>fuzzy</strong>: Oh my, it looks like diamonds!</p>
<p><strong>mean green</strong>: Give me the keys!!!</p>
<p><strong>coach</strong>: They took my laptop with my PowerPoint
presentation, my Blackberry, my cell… And to top it off, my car crapped
out on the side of the road! I’m not making the conference and I have
fourteen leads waiting for me. You gotta help me out here. I’m not
kidding, I’ve have fourteen PRIMO leads waiting in the lobby of the
Mariott… MARIOTT…</p>
<p><strong>coach</strong>: Son of a – In with anger, out with love.</p>
<p><strong>para</strong>: Hey…</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: Shut up, fag.</p>
<p><strong>edgy cat</strong>: You’re late!</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: Don’t dilly-dally then. Rack ’em!</p>
<p><strong>note</strong>: Music plays over all the bar sequences.</p>
<p><strong>beer guy</strong>: I mean, we’d been together for so long and
then… bang! She drops me. Since then, it’s been like a damn country
song: she’s gone, the car’s repossessed, and a father figure made a pass
at me. I’m not saying I ever had it. But I have definitely lost it. Now
I haul this swill from armpit to armpit. I used to be a model for
Christ’s sake.</p>
<p><strong>coach</strong>: For what, may I ask?</p>
<p><strong>beer guy</strong>: JC Penny. Spring wear.</p>
<p><strong>coach</strong>: You know, Chach, catching you at this low
point is pure serendipity.</p>
<p><strong>beer guy</strong>: Why is that?</p>
<p><strong>coach</strong>: Because I take the rubble of man and build
superstars. In my briefcase here is a doorway to a self-help sensation.
Give me a minute, because I’d like to buy you a drink and change your
life forever. I have a brochure –</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Save it. We don’t deal in pamphlets
’round here. We stick to chemistry. And his drinks are on me.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Was that the last keg?</p>
<p><strong>beer guy</strong>: Yup, one keg of Beast for the basement,
then the truck’s dry.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: If you’re stayin’, move the truck, boss
gets pissed about you using primo parking.</p>
<p><strong>beer guy</strong>: Right, ’cause this joint’s hopping.</p>
<p><strong>on tv</strong>: A NEWSCASTER, dressed in a coat and tie,
talks.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: …the search for the missing protesters
will be further complicated by the unstable conditions of these deep
tunnels. Thus far, no sign of life has been detected, yet town officials
are still optimistic.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: On a brighter note, or should I say a
darker note, tomorrow’s solar eclipse will bring out adults and children
alike for a citywide fair of this metrological event. Stay tuned for our
man on the street to take a closer look…</p>
<p><strong>boss man</strong>: Listen, bud. I got a load ready to move
and your man’s not here.</p>
<p><strong>roadie</strong>: He’s coming. Relax. And if he doesn’t show
–</p>
<p><strong>boss man</strong>: We got a problem.</p>
<p><strong>trampy</strong>: He said there was no reason I had to stay a
teller and that if I did good work and didn’t mess up, I could become an
assistant manager within three years. Can you believe that?</p>
<p><strong>adulterer</strong>: That sounds great.</p>
<p><strong>trampy</strong>: That sounds like bullshit! I could be an
assistant manager at The Lake Arrowhead Casino for knowing the fuckin’
alphabet to G! I’ll be twenty in three months…</p>
<p><strong>adulterer</strong>: Just bring the whole bottle.</p>
<p><strong>belle</strong>: If I could made that kind of money, I’d be in
Hollywood next week.</p>
<p><strong>tuffy</strong>: ’Round here, there are ways.</p>
<p><strong>edgy cat</strong>: That cash is gonna look much better in my
pocket.</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: Ya know, that deer only looks scared when
you’re in the room.</p>
<p><strong>para</strong>: Excuse me, please.</p>
<p><strong>edgy cat</strong>: Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>edgy cat</strong>: That’s all she wrote…</p>
<p><strong>edgy cat</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: Ohhh, now that’s a rough one.</p>
<p><strong>edgy cat</strong>: That’s motherfuckin’ impossible!</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: Yoh anga will be yoh downfah. Go again?</p>
<p><strong>edgy cat</strong>: Goddamn it! NO!</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: Oh, come on. Crape Diem!</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: Wake up! Check your pants!</p>
<p><strong>grandpa</strong>: Get outta here.</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: What’s that? Wha’cha say? Huh? How much for
the whole night, Grandma?</p>
<p><strong>grandma</strong>: You should be so lucky.</p>
<p><strong>grandpa</strong>: This one will stun ya, but this one will
put ya to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: Whoa!</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: You boys wanna try your luck at the loot?</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: Come on, I’ll even throw with my left
hand.</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: Nothin’ but a bunch of butts and pussies in
here!</p>
<p><strong>belle</strong>: Shit! Shit! Shit!</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Don’t sweat it, just clean it up before
he’s done.</p>
<p><strong>tuffy</strong>: Keep these on, sweetheart.</p>
<p><strong>cody</strong>: Mommy, I want Nemo.</p>
<p><strong>tuffy</strong>: Mommy’s working on it.</p>
<p><strong>tuffy</strong>: Let’s get this over with.</p>
<p><strong>boss man</strong>: I love a woman with enthusiasm.</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: I got two hundred bucks says none of you can
beat me!</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Hey! Get quiet or get out.</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: C’mon guys –</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: Gimme some ACTION –</p>
<p><strong>hero</strong>: Unless you people want to die you’ll do what I
say and you’ll do it fast!</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: You hold it right there, mister.</p>
<p><strong>hero</strong>: A storm of hell’s coming down on this place
any minute!</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Drop the canon!</p>
<p><strong>hero</strong>: I’m not armed now, just hear me out.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: I’ll drop you and not even think about
it!</p>
<p><strong>hero</strong>: Let me explain!</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: You got one second to –</p>
<p><strong>hero</strong>: Take a good look and listen to me! There’s at
least a four of these things out there!</p>
<p><strong>hero</strong>: I saw one of them tear up five men like they
were corn on the cob! I don’t know what they are. I don’t know where
they came from. All I do know is that these fuckers are fast, nasty, and
hungry.</p>
<p><strong>hero</strong>: And they can fly. Not to mention they got
claws like Ginsu knifes and more teeth than a chainsaw.</p>
<p><strong>hero</strong>: They’re like goddamn blood hungry biker
tattoos come to life. They’re clocking us. Right now. And we have to
lock this bar down! That means doors, windows, drains, and basements. We
have to do it fast!</p>
<p><strong>hero</strong>: You! Get on that phone. Call the cops,
National Guard, townies, whoever kicks ass and get ’em out here.</p>
<p><strong>hero</strong>: Any questions?</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>hero</strong>: I’m the hero –</p>
<p><strong>edgy cat</strong>: I got you!</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: Got ’cha!</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: Goddamn you!</p>
<p><strong>roadie</strong>: You’ll hit her!</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: What the FUCK was that?</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: The jungle has a new king.</p>
<p><strong>boss man</strong>: Is it clear?!</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>boss man</strong>: Is there a gun pointing at you?</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Nah, I got the gun.</p>
<p><strong>boss man</strong>: Alright goddamn it! Who shot me!? Who did
it!?</p>
<p><strong>boss man</strong>: My goddamn foot is gone! Who fuckin’ shot
me? Who fuckin’ shot me!?</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Her fella.</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: My husband…</p>
<p><strong>boss man</strong>: Well, where’s the sonuvabitch!?</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: He’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>boss man</strong>: What? What the hell happened down
here?!</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: I didn’t do it! It was fuckin’ monsters,
asshole!</p>
<p><strong>boss man</strong>: Jesus Christ on the cross… someone make
sense.</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: Easy. We’re surrounded by something the
likes none of you have ever seen before. Some kind of animals. Real
fast, volatile, predators. One went through three of your patrons like
nothing.</p>
<p><strong>boss man</strong>: So, your dead hubby shot me twice, three
of my customers have been eaten, and there are angry creatures
outside?</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: He only shot you once.</p>
<p><strong>boss man</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: He shot you the other time.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: It was an accident. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>adulterer</strong>: Look at it!</p>
<p><strong>boss man</strong>: Fan-fuckin-tastic.</p>
<p><strong>tuffy</strong>: My god… what is that?</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: That’s one piece of four problems.</p>
<p><strong>boss man</strong>: Please elaborate.</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: That head over there, that’s the oldest of
the bunch, looked like the Grandpa. We caught the little one, Junior, in
the cooler there. As we’ve seen, what he lacks in size he more than
makes up for in speed.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: And the rest of ’em?</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: Unfortunately, the worst of ’em are still
outside.</p>
<p><strong>note</strong>: As Heroine describes each beast, we see a
slight glimpse of their virtues, hidden mainly by shadows and fog.</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: The next one is taller, but all out of
proportion. Like a “teen beast.”</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: He was spastic, clumsy, but deadly just the
same.</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: I just took the eye out of the mother. She
calculates, guiding the attacks.</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: If you are face to face with her, dive
left.</p>
<p><strong>roadie</strong>: And the last one is the –</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: Father. The biggest, the strongest…</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: No sign of any weaknesses. No sign at all.
He’s an eating machine.</p>
<p><strong>coach</strong>: Of all the friggin’ bars to be stuck in.</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: That’s not it. Four are here, but there’s
three others… which I can’t account for.</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: We need to lock this place down. Is
everyone in this room?</p>
<p><strong>tuffy</strong>: Oh my god! My son! My SON!</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: Wait!</p>
<p><strong>tuffy</strong>: Cody! Mommy’s coming! Mommy’s coming!</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: Stop her!</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>cody</strong>: Mommy –</p>
<p><strong>tuffy</strong>: Oh sweetheart! What was I thinking? Mommy is
never gonna let you go!</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: Let’s lock off this room.</p>
<p><strong>tuffy</strong>: Never, ever, never. Never, ever, never, baby.
I love you –</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: Damn it.</p>
<p><strong>beer guy</strong>: Oh god…</p>
<p><strong>coach</strong>: Are you –</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: Just let her be… please. Is that the only
phone?</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: The back phone is wrecked, too.</p>
<p><strong>belle</strong>: This is really happening. I can’t believe
this is really happening.</p>
<p><strong>grandpa</strong>: What’d you say?</p>
<p><strong>grandma</strong>: I didn’t say anything.</p>
<p><strong>para</strong>: Thank you, but I don’t need any help –</p>
<p><strong>belle</strong>: What’s this? A power magnet or something?</p>
<p><strong>para</strong>: No. It’s nothing.</p>
<p><strong>belle</strong>: I didn’t peg you for a con man.</p>
<p><strong>para</strong>: Hey, it pays more than the couch.</p>
<p><strong>belle</strong>: Lots of stuff around here does.</p>
<p><strong>trampy</strong>: Here!</p>
<p><strong>trampy</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>adulterer</strong>: Back off!</p>
<p><strong>beer guy</strong>: So, what now? Did those things leave?</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: Why don’t you go check it out?</p>
<p><strong>beer guy</strong>: Fuck no.</p>
<p><strong>adulterer</strong>: I have a signal! I have – Diane? Diane
listen to me… get the kids and get in the basement… do it right now…</p>
<p><strong>adulterer</strong>: I’ll explain later. Not now! I’m at a
bar… look… shut up! JUST SHUT</p>
<p><strong>up and get in the fucking basement,</strong>: DIANE! Diane!
Diane?… Hello? Damn it! I lost the signal!</p>
<p><strong>adulterer</strong>: Okay. Okay. Look now, I gotta get outta
here! I gotta go! My wife… See my wife is alone… She could be in
trouble. I GOTTA GO!</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: I wouldn’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>adulterer</strong>: Fuck you, bitch!</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: You can risk your life, but not mine! My
daughter’s no more than twenty miles from here waiting for me. I have
just as much reason to leave this place as you do. But I also know that
if they’re here, then they’re not there yet.</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: You understand me?</p>
<p><strong>adulterer</strong>: Get the fuck off…</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: You understand me!?</p>
<p><strong>adulterer</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: Now pull that tough boy shit again and I’ll
slice you from neck to nuts!</p>
<p><strong>adulterer</strong>: You can’t keep me here. This is bullshit.
Fuckin’ bullshit. This is fucking BULLSHIT!</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: We can’t risk letting them in.</p>
<p><strong>adulterer</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: Anything?</p>
<p><strong>para</strong>: Yeah, you got it.</p>
<p><strong>belle</strong>: See! This has to be isolated. That’s a local
broadcast.</p>
<p><strong>on tv</strong>: The Newscaster reads the teleprompter.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: And now, we head to our man on the scene
with a live look at tomorrow’s event in Red Mountain.</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: My daughter’s in Red Mountain.</p>
<p><strong>on tv</strong>: There is an awkward pause from the
Newscaster. The broadcast doesn’t cut to the reporter.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: Can you hear us? Apparently we’re having
some technical difficulties…</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: Oh no.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: Oh, there we go!</p>
<p><strong>on tv</strong>: A REPORTER, in an even worse suit, stands in
a field with several people looking through telescopes.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: That’s right, the crowds are lining up
early to witness tomorrow’s meteorological phenomenon.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: But always remember, don’t look straight
into the sun because a special filter is needed to avoid damaging your
cornea.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: And we’re all looking forward to it
tomorrow. Back to you.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: Thank you. And in other news…</p>
<p><strong>roadie</strong>: That studio’s local, we can call in.</p>
<p><strong>boss man</strong>: I have a short wave radio upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>trampy</strong>: I’m calling them… it’s ringing!</p>
<p><strong>roadie</strong>: They’d have a police scanner.</p>
<p><strong>trampy</strong>: Hello? Yes, we’re at the United –</p>
<p><strong>on tv</strong>: the Newscaster continues his routine.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: …it has been reported that the power
outage –</p>
<p><strong>trampy</strong>: Oh no! Oh fucking no!</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: Keep it together! I came from the east.
That studio is south of here. For all we know, north and west are
okay.</p>
<p><strong>roadie</strong>: An associate of mine was coming in from the
north, ain’t heard a word from him in hours.</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: So, that leaves the west.</p>
<p><strong>tuffy</strong>: And Red Mountain. Your daughter.</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>beer guy</strong>: This is goddamn depressing.</p>
<p><strong>boss man</strong>: I’ve got some tools and extra planks in
the kitchen, if we’re on the same page here.</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: Let’s work.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: We’ll it ain’t pretty…</p>
<p><strong>boss man</strong>: But its got teeth.</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: I think it’s hungry again.</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: We have to kill it. Can you help?</p>
<p><strong>boss man</strong>: Fire in the hole!</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: I think we got –</p>
<p><strong>tuffy</strong>: You’re welcome.</p>
<p><strong>trampy</strong>: Jesus, it took all that? All those bullets?
How can we possibly fight off the others?</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: Aim for their orifices. Eyes, ears and
mouth. From what I’ve seen, it’s their only weakness.</p>
<p><strong>roadie</strong>: Looks like they’re soft on the inside like
any other animal. Trick is to get in there and do the damage.</p>
<p><strong>belle</strong>: Maybe we don’t have to fight them.</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: Right, let’s just call ’em names.</p>
<p><strong>coach</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen, if I may have your
attention.</p>
<p><strong>coach</strong>: We have to think outside the box here. We
don’t need to fight them, we need to scare them. Scare them right back.
This is a species stand- off. We just need to show them we’re not
vulnerable. That we’re formidable.</p>
<p><strong>adulterer</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>coach</strong>: I need a stick.</p>
<p><strong>coach</strong>: Stand back.</p>
<p><strong>coach</strong>: Let’s get that board down.</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>coach</strong>: Showing superiority. The scent of their dead
may drive them away.</p>
<p><strong>beer guy</strong>: I don’t see them.</p>
<p><strong>coach</strong>: Come on. Come onnnnnn.</p>
<p><strong>belle</strong>: Is there a call, or something?</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: See that you monkey fucks! That’s what you get
when you mess with us! Woman or man, I don’t give a fuck! Shit don’t
make me gay because you’ll be sucking my dick!</p>
<p><strong>para</strong>: Sweet…</p>
<p><strong>beer guy</strong>: It’s working. I think it’s working.</p>
<p><strong>coach</strong>: You see? What I tell you?</p>
<p><strong>adulterer</strong>: Good christ! They’re cannibals!</p>
<p><strong>coach</strong>: Oh dear…</p>
<p><strong>trampy</strong>: Oh… my… god.</p>
<p><strong>para</strong>: What are they doing now?</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: Dude, they’re humpin’!</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: Get back!</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: Any more ideas, Animal Planet?</p>
<p><strong>coach</strong>: I-I-I was just being proactive…</p>
<p><strong>beer guy</strong>: Hey, you weren’t helpin’!</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: Go douche.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: What the hell now?</p>
<p><strong>adulterer</strong>: We’re stuck in here. That’s what.</p>
<p><strong>roadie</strong>: Hey, Miss?</p>
<p><strong>roadie</strong>: If you don’t mind me asking, how did you run
into these things?</p>
<p><strong>boss man</strong>: More importantly, how did you run away
from these things?</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: Well, it all started about forty hours
ago…</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: So, how is staying with Grandma working
out? Ya know, if you stare into her glasses, you can see what cards she
is holding. But I didn’t tell you that.</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: Mommy will pick you up tomorrow night, okay
baby?</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: Hello? Charlie?</p>
<p><strong>hero</strong>: Holy mother of…</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: We barricaded ourselves in the cellar. Then
it was just listening. We heard those things destroy an entire heard of
livestock. They just kept coming. Closer and closer, consuming anything
in the way. Slashing, feeding and licking the bones clean. Just when we
said our prayers, the first ray of sun hit the house…</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: That first beam of sunlight drove ’em away.
Somewhere. We called who we could and then decided to run for it. We
didn’t see a soul the whole drive out. When the tank went dry, we came
upon a gas station to refill.</p>
<p><strong>hero</strong>: What’s goin’ on? The pumps are off.</p>
<p><strong>tubbs</strong>: There’s nobody here –</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: They’ve been here!</p>
<p><strong>hero</strong>: Turn on the pump!</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: We had no time. All we knew was the sun was
dropping and we had to get enough fuel to make it through the night at
90 miles per hour…</p>
<p><strong>hero</strong>: Suck it down you metal bitch. Suck it
down.</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: It happened fast…</p>
<p><strong>hero</strong>: Move it!</p>
<p><strong>hero</strong>: Get in the car, baby.</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: That’s when I saw three others… just for a
second.</p>
<p><strong>hero</strong>: Roll!</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: Close the roof!</p>
<p><strong>hero</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>hero</strong>: We made it!</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: It must have smelled the blood or
something. We buried the body and got back on the main road when…</p>
<p><strong>hero</strong>: Break!</p>
<p><strong>hero</strong>: Go! Go! Go!</p>
<p><strong>hero</strong>: Look out!</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: And that’s how I ended up here.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: And the head?</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: I don’t want to talk about that.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: So, your husband ditched you?</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: No. It was wild out there. No time to
think. We just moved. He didn’t leave me. He just ran.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Well, justice is funny.</p>
<p><strong>roadie</strong>: The three from the gas pump are over at the
TV station? And you say there’s four here, huh?</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: It appears so.</p>
<p><strong>coach</strong>: There’s five here now, actually.</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: Yeah, thanks for that.</p>
<p><strong>para</strong>: Hey, you lived on a farm, right?</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>adulterer</strong>: Do you think they’re gone? I haven’t
heard anything for a while, maybe they’re gone.</p>
<p><strong>belle</strong>: Well, maybe they migrate?</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: As long as it’s dark, they’re around. They
hide, wait for you to drop your guard, and then attack.</p>
<p><strong>trampy</strong>: How can you be so sure? You said yourself
this started a day ago.</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: We learned fast.</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: We? We learned fast? You are all that is left
of we. No offense Pocohantas, but I think someone else should play
“Chief” tonight. Someone that knows the lay of the land. Like me.</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>adulterer</strong>: Maybe these things are like locusts or
something and only come out for a few days to feed. This could just be a
part of their life cycle.</p>
<p><strong>belle</strong>: Somebody’s gotta know something about these
things. This stuff just doesn’t happen out of the blue.</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: You!</p>
<p><strong>grandpa</strong>: Wha?</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: You gotta know somethin’, you’re old.</p>
<p><strong>grandpa</strong>: I don’t know a thing.</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: Old people know stuff like this. Legends, tall
tales, shit like that.</p>
<p><strong>grandpa</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: Spill it!</p>
<p><strong>grandpa</strong>: I don’t know anything!</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: How ’bout you? Or do I have to get rough?</p>
<p><strong>grandma</strong>: Heavens no!</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: Come on! Think back!</p>
<p><strong>grandpa</strong>: If I throw a stick, will you go away?</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: That’s just horse shit.</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: Relax, they don’t know anything.</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: Yeah… allegedly.</p>
<p><strong>para</strong>: Hey, where was your farm?</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: East. Why?</p>
<p><strong>para</strong>: Did you ever slaughter? Slaughter
livestock?</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: Previous owners did, I think.</p>
<p><strong>coach</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>para</strong>: Slaughterhouse run-off used to be drained into
piping that ran through the mountains.</p>
<p><strong>para</strong>: Earthquakes often cracked the piping and those
flow lines were condemned, but never drained.</p>
<p><strong>coach</strong>: Cheese n’ rice…</p>
<p><strong>trampy</strong>: I still don’t get it.</p>
<p><strong>para</strong>: What I am saying is… there’s a distinct
possibility that what we are up against is the result of steady stream
of blood and tissue that has been leaking into the caves. And a day ago…
something broke out.</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: The first order of business is gettin’ a big
fuckin’ tampon in that cave!</p>
<p><strong>para</strong>: Nope, that wouldn’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: I wouldn’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: They’re probably on to the next buffet by now.
There’s a retirement home up the road, they’d be easy pickings.</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: Careful.</p>
<p><strong>adulterer</strong>: I’m telling you, I don’t see a thing
–</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: Everyone stay in the middle of the room!
Off the walls! NOW!</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: Now, does everyone agree that they are
still out there?</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: ’Eh, Chief?</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: …Duh.</p>
<p><strong>trampy</strong>: He’s out cold.</p>
<p><strong>belle</strong>: I know some first aid if we have a kit. Do
we?</p>
<p><strong>boss man</strong>: In the kitchen, under the sink.</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: No one goes anywhere alone. Least of all,
unarmed.</p>
<p><strong>tuffy</strong>: There’s some sweats in my bag behind the
bar.</p>
<p><strong>coach</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>roadie</strong>: You’re a clever man. Why do you take shit
from him?</p>
<p><strong>para</strong>: Yeah, he’s an ass, but he’s my brother. Que
sera-sera.</p>
<p><strong>roadie</strong>: Your brother, huh?</p>
<p><strong>para</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>roadie</strong>: Same parents?</p>
<p><strong>para</strong>: Look man, I read books. He reads bumper
stickers.</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: Alright, we need to stay alert and for
everyone to take a role. You gotta have some guns or weapons around
here.</p>
<p><strong>boss man</strong>: I got my .38 here. That’s six shots and
two refills. Downstairs, I have locker with a sawed-off and some
gardening tools. Maybe a few boxes of shells.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: I got shells, too. Box and a half tops.
Machete behind the bar.</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: Okay, well that’s something.</p>
<p><strong>roadie</strong>: So we’ve got guns, kitchen knives, pipes,
fire and sticks.</p>
<p><strong>beer guy</strong>: I might be able to do something with the
bottles.</p>
<p><strong>grandpa</strong>: You’re gonna need a whole lot more than
that to get outta here alive.</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: Oh, now you have something to say?</p>
<p><strong>grandpa</strong>: You young’uns worry about weapons, I’m
thinkin’ ’bout strategy.</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: Oh? And what’s that?</p>
<p><strong>grandpa</strong>: Sit still, look less like a meal.</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: That’s for bears and sharks, chunky chew.</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: Alright, what else do we have? Can we
somehow contact the outside world?</p>
<p><strong>trampy</strong>: I can’t get anybody. I don’t even know if I
have a signal anymore.</p>
<p><strong>beer guy</strong>: I have a CB in my truck, we could get some
help out here.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Who the hell would you call?</p>
<p><strong>beer guy</strong>: Anyone.</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: Do you drive a short beer bus or something?
You go out there, you get eaten. You stay in here, you get eaten. Anyone
comes to help, they get eaten. Don’t you see a pattern here, Spuds
Makenzie?</p>
<p><strong>beer guy</strong>: Then I guess we should just give up.</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: Believe me, I’d love to save the day and get
some heroic snatch, but it’s not in the cards, partner.</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: You said you had a short wave radio.</p>
<p><strong>trampy</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>boss man</strong>: Go for it. It’s by the far wall. Channel 9
is the emergency frequency.</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: Good. I’m heading to the basement for
supplies. And you’re going upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: Let’s not get carried away…</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: Step up, Chief.</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: So that’s how it is? Fine! Shotgun,
please.</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: You’re coming with, portly. ’Cause if I’m
attacked, I want a fat man close by.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: I’ll wait by the door.</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: Now who else is comin’?</p>
<p><strong>grandpa</strong>: I’ll go with ya.</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: What are you gonna do? Throw your teeth at
’em? Sit down, Cocoon.</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: You! Zorba! You’re coming too! Now gimme the
keys.</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: No. You’re locked in.</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: Those two will be on the other side waiting
for you. If you become food, I don’t want the only set of keys in the
belly of one of those things.</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: Don’t get your hopes up.</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: Any volunteers to head into the basement
with me?</p>
<p><strong>tuffy</strong>: I will.</p>
<p><strong>beer guy</strong>: That’s not a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>boss man</strong>: With what happened upstairs –</p>
<p><strong>tuffy</strong>: Shut up! Shut your mouth. You have no idea
what is running through me right now. No idea. I’m ready.</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: Alright.</p>
<p><strong>roadie</strong>: Count me in.</p>
<p><strong>beer guy</strong>: Me too.</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: Alright you two, I don’t want to hear any of
this, “oh, I dropped the key, wrong key, ain’t no key here.” When I want
out, I want out, ok?</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: They’re right here.</p>
<p><strong>coach</strong>: We’ve got your back, bro.</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: Just keep ’em handy, ladies.</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: Wish me luck…</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: I’m okay! I’m okay!</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: Come on. Come on. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: Geeezzzus. Okay, now. Easy steps. Easy
breaths. Easy steps.</p>
<p><strong>belle</strong>: How are you holding up?</p>
<p><strong>boss man</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>belle</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p><strong>boss man</strong>: Morphine. My magic potion. I need a few
drops.</p>
<p><strong>boss man</strong>: You should try a little, it’ll calm your
nerves. Works like a charm.</p>
<p><strong>belle</strong>: No other time than now, right?</p>
<p><strong>boss man</strong>: Wait, before you do that, help me move.
There’s a small room off the kitchen where I can lay down.</p>
<p><strong>belle</strong>: But –</p>
<p><strong>boss man</strong>: It’s much safer in there. Trust me.</p>
<p><strong>roadie</strong>: Stay on your toes everybody.</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>roadie</strong>: You don’t need to know what that is.</p>
<p><strong>beer guy</strong>: There’s a sawed-off shotgun in here.</p>
<p><strong>coach</strong>: Come on, bro.</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: Lamaze. Lamaze. Lamaze.</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: Just a bat! I’m okay! Just a bat!</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: If he doesn’t shut up…</p>
<p><strong>coach</strong>: He is human kabob.</p>
<p><strong>belle</strong>: Doesn’t your foot hurt?</p>
<p><strong>boss man</strong>: I can’t feel a thing, Hon.</p>
<p><strong>belle</strong>: How ’bout now?</p>
<p><strong>boss man</strong>: You’re a bad girl, aren’t you.</p>
<p><strong>belle</strong>: Um-hmmm.</p>
<p><strong>boss man</strong>: The girl’s got rhythm.</p>
<p><strong>boss man</strong>: There it is.</p>
<p><strong>roadie</strong>: This is all junk.</p>
<p><strong>beer guy</strong>: This could come in handy.</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: Let’s get everything upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>tuffy</strong>: Don’t worry, I’m fine. Really.</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: I admire your strength.</p>
<p><strong>tuffy</strong>: Trust me, I plan on having a full breakdown
when this is over, but for now, we all have to be strong, right?</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: This is my daughter, Charlie. She’s all I’m
after.</p>
<p><strong>tuffy</strong>: Oh…</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: And I’m gonna need your strength, every bit
of it.</p>
<p><strong>tuffy</strong>: You have it.</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: Good. But still do me a favor.</p>
<p><strong>tuffy</strong>: Name it.</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: Don’t tell anyone I have a soft side.</p>
<p><strong>tuffy</strong>: Deal.</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: Hello? Anyone there? We need help out here at
the United Nations Tavern. Send guns, tanks, and all that shit.</p>
<p><strong>belle</strong>: You wanna see, baby?</p>
<p><strong>boss man</strong>: Hell yeah.</p>
<p><strong>belle</strong>: How much you got?</p>
<p><strong>boss man</strong>: How much I got, what?</p>
<p><strong>belle</strong>: How much you got to see the show?</p>
<p><strong>boss man</strong>: You don’t understand, sweety. Daddy
doesn’t pay. Daddy sees the show for free. But you do get points for
being horny on a night like this.</p>
<p><strong>belle</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>boss man</strong>: You can’t expect a man to buy a car
without a test drive first, can you?</p>
<p><strong>belle</strong>: Um, hmm –</p>
<p><strong>boss man</strong>: Now wiggle that sweet little ass over here
and sit on Daddy’s face, I wanna do some appraising.</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: Repeat. We need help. SOS. Calling all cars!
Calling all cars! We need help at the United Nations Tav –</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: Double shit!</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: Okay, I’m ready to come out now!</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: “OH!?” WHAT IS “OH?” What does “oh” mean?</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Wha?</p>
<p><strong>belle</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>boss man</strong>: Hoh-SHIT! Help!! Help me!!!</p>
<p><strong>coach</strong>: Great god, why do you damn me?!</p>
<p><strong>para</strong>: Oh please, no.</p>
<p><strong>boss man</strong>: They’re getting in! Somebody help!</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: The key broke off!</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: Move it!</p>
<p><strong>para</strong>: I thought that was it for a second there.</p>
<p><strong>trampy</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: I got Papa in the stones. He’s neutered.</p>
<p><strong>para</strong>: Whoa… good one…</p>
<p><strong>roadie</strong>: That back room is sealed shut.</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: I told you to stay in the main room.</p>
<p><strong>boss man</strong>: Yeah… I will. I will. Promise.</p>
<p><strong>coach</strong>: If they can’t reproduce anymore – we are one
step closer! A big step! Now is the time to band together. We need to
rise up against these monsters of the night! Those creatures are no
match for the human spirit! We can do it! We just need to believe in
each other! In all of us! We need to make a stand! Right here! Right
now!</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: Dude, are you gay?</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: We know what not to do. We must stay
focused and together. The beasts will find a breach. We gotta find a way
out before they find a way in.</p>
<p><strong>tuffy</strong>: Let’s run for the cars, cause mass
confusion.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: The lot’s too damn far, that’s surefire
suicide.</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>boss man</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: You know what.</p>
<p><strong>boss man</strong>: I don’t know shit.</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: You. What was that door downstairs?</p>
<p><strong>boss man</strong>: Wait, wait, wait.</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: Don’t bullshit me.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: It’s a tunnel.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: It runs about a hundred yards and spits
out on the backside of that hill down the way.</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: What’s it for?</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: What’s it for!?</p>
<p><strong>boss man</strong>: Grass, man. I grow pot down there.</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: Does the tunnel spit out near a car?</p>
<p><strong>boss man</strong>: It spits out behind the parking lot.</p>
<p><strong>boss man</strong>: My truck is near, but it ain’t nearly big
enough to haul the whole lot.</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: It’s a shot. Is it gassed up?</p>
<p><strong>boss man</strong>: Fully.</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: Four door?</p>
<p><strong>boss man</strong>: Two.</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: How many can it hold?</p>
<p><strong>boss man</strong>: Six.</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: Max?</p>
<p><strong>boss man</strong>: Seven.</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: It’s gonna fit thirteen.</p>
<p><strong>boss man</strong>: Thirteen clowns wouldn’t fit.</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: Keys.</p>
<p><strong>roadie</strong>: What’re you planning?</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: Three of us go. Two to defend, one to
drive. We back up to the bar and then tear ass out of here.</p>
<p><strong>boss man</strong>: Sounds sketchy.</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: Let me make this clear; if we stay, we
die.</p>
<p><strong>roadie</strong>: Give ’em to me, I’m going.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: You’re trusting that con? He’ll ditch us
and never look back.</p>
<p><strong>roadie</strong>: Fuck you too.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Get in line!</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: Hey! I’m not trusting him either, that’s
why I’m going with.</p>
<p><strong>coach</strong>: “Courage is being scared to death, but
saddling up anyway.” The Duke. I will go.</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: This is it. They have this place
surrounded, but if we go under them we might just make it.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: This is a bottleneck waiting to
happen.</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: This one’s great under pressure. I wish you
luck.</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: The rest of you prepare the weapons,
whatever you got left. ‘Cause when we crash through those walls, we’re
bringin’ death with us.</p>
<p><strong>coach</strong>: No, I don’t believe in guns.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: This ain’t time for a political
stance.</p>
<p><strong>coach</strong>: This doesn’t run out of ammo.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Got ya.</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: When you get to that truck… drive it like you
stole it.</p>
<p><strong>trampy</strong>: How does it feel?</p>
<p><strong>adulterer</strong>: Lousy.</p>
<p><strong>trampy</strong>: You still have one left.</p>
<p><strong>adulterer</strong>: Yes, the silver lining.</p>
<p><strong>trampy</strong>: It serves you right for cheating.</p>
<p><strong>adulterer</strong>: Spare me.</p>
<p><strong>trampy</strong>: I figure it’s karma. You wronged me and you
wronged your wife, so this is karma biting you on the ass, or in your
case… in the eye.</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: Oh yeah?</p>
<p><strong>trampy</strong>: It could be worse, you could be dead. Then
again, the climax is upon us.</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: Ya know, that’s not a bad look on you. Kinda
1985, but not bad. I’d hook it up.</p>
<p><strong>trampy</strong>: I wouldn’t fuck you for practice.</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: Tease.</p>
<p><strong>adulterer</strong>: Leave her alone.</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: Hey, cyclops. Let’s have a quiet contest…
starting now.</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: Ya know, in situations of duress, I have found
that women are attracted to my authority.</p>
<p><strong>roadie</strong>: You handle yourself pretty well. You a cop
or a criminal?</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: Neither. Just a farmer.</p>
<p><strong>roadie</strong>: Oh yeah? Then how do you do it?</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: I just think about my husband and daughter…
and the rest is easy.</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: Easy.</p>
<p><strong>roadie</strong>: This place is creepy in the daytime, too.
Ready?</p>
<p><strong>roadie</strong>: Scared?</p>
<p><strong>coach</strong>: No. You?</p>
<p><strong>roadie</strong>: Of course not. I fight monsters all the
time. On three.</p>
<p><strong>coach</strong>: One… two… three!!!</p>
<p><strong>coach</strong>: Well, look at that.</p>
<p><strong>coach</strong>: Hey, little fella.</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>coach</strong>: Looks like a brothel for plants.</p>
<p><strong>roadie</strong>: Shhhhhhhhhhhhh.</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: Ah-ah-ah! You’re doing that all wrong!</p>
<p><strong>beer guy</strong>: What do you know?</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: I know you’re doing it wrong.</p>
<p><strong>beer guy</strong>: Prove it.</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: Move aside, princess.</p>
<p><strong>coach</strong>: You and I are similar. We both have accents.
We both travel a lot. We both don’t really have homes…</p>
<p><strong>roadie</strong>: You should be quiet.</p>
<p><strong>coach</strong>: I am sorry, I ramble when I’m nervous.</p>
<p><strong>heroine</strong>: Quiet.</p>
<p><strong>coach</strong>: It’s just that this seems like the opportune
time for someone to be horribly… offed.</p>
<p><strong>roadie</strong>: What did I say?</p>
<p><strong>coach</strong>: Sorry. I’m done now.</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: You don’t want the rag touching booze, that
way you can hold it and ensure it explodes when you throw it.</p>
<p><strong>para</strong>: You sure? I thought the rag had to touch?</p>
<p><strong>bozo</strong>: I’m sure.</p>
