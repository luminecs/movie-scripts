<p><strong>doc walks down the bleak hallway</strong>: A BLACK PRISONER
PASSES Doc in the corridor, they slap hands… the Guard remains at his
shoulder. Near the end of the passage another Guard clangs open a barred
door and allows Doc and the First Guard to enter the room where he
stands sentry.</p>
<p><strong>chairman</strong>: I think we can begin… First parole request
Carter “Doc” McCoy… is legal counsel present?</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: Yes. Eugene Stewart representing
Mr. McCoy.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: watching… taking it all in.</p>
<p><strong>chairman</strong>: Carter McCoy, one to five years sentence
for armed robbery, first offense in the State of Texas, wanted by the
State of Ohio for assault with a deadly weapon and armed robbery…</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: The State of Ohio has waved jurisdiction,
Mr. Chairman. They no longer seek Mr. McCoy in connection with that
case.</p>
<p><strong>chairman</strong>: That is correct. Very well. Mr. McCoy has
served four years of his sentence. Prison record satisfactory. Applied
for parole on September 5th of this year…</p>
<p><strong>chairman</strong>: Remarks?</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: We would only again like to call the
committee’s attention to Mr. McCoy’s satisfactory behavior as a
prisoner.</p>
<p><strong>chairman</strong>: Notice is taken.</p>
<p><strong>chairman</strong>: The Board met in closed chambers last
week… have you reached a decision regarding Mr. McCoy’s request for
parole?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: His face is taut.</p>
<p><strong>second man</strong>: Request for parole is denied. The
prisoner may re-apply in one calendar year.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: lowers his eyes, then looks up at his lawyer.
The lawyer avoids Doc’s glance., he shuffles the papers in front of him,
begins stuffing them into his briefcase.</p>
<p><strong>chairman</strong>: Very well. The next request for parole is
from John Doty. Is legal counsel present?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>chairman</strong>: Mr. Doty is serving five to twelve years
for embezzlement of corporate funds.</p>
<p><strong>doc playing chess with an old con in a bleak work room
-</strong>: torn, magazines, beaten up radio, butt cans filled with
sand.</p>
<p><strong>doc working with several prisoners, all of them on
their</strong>: HANDS AND KNEES, cleaning a long line of open, filthy
toilets… a Guard stands nearby.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Hello, Doc.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: It’s been raining a lot the last few
days.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: We’ll try again.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: No way. I’ve got to get out now.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Do it now.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: I want to see Jack Beynon.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Go right in, Mrs. McCoy.</p>
<p><strong>cully</strong>: Class - regular?</p>
<p><strong>swain</strong>: No. Doc McCoy’s old lady.</p>
<p><strong>cully</strong>: Jesus. Carol Ainsley?</p>
<p><strong>swain</strong>: The very same.</p>
<p><strong>cully</strong>: The Doctor took out McGovern for her.</p>
<p><strong>swain</strong>: She only rides winning - Class easy
class.</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>beynon</strong>: How are you, Mrs. McCoy?</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Ready to talk about my husband,
Mr. Beynon.</p>
<p><strong>beynon</strong>: So the good Doctor comes up again. Please
sit down.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: He’s asked me to come and see you.</p>
<p><strong>beynon</strong>: Why? Can I help?</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Yes, I think you can.</p>
<p><strong>doc exits the prison and stands waiting near the auto
gate.</strong>: He looks down the two-lane blacktop road that runs along
the edge of the penitentiary… Doc turns, looks again at the prison… four
years is a long time.</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: Mr. Beynon will see you the day after
tomorrow 12:30 at the River Walk.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Hello, Doc.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I’m a lot better off than I was an hour
ago.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: You want to drive?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: My license expired, let’s get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Sure…</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: I’m sorry I was late… I got my hair done… the
girl was slow.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: It looks fine.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Feel good?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Where do you want to go?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I want to take a walk.</p>
<p><strong>they park the car and exit. doc moves a little ahead
of</strong>: Carol. He sits on the bank watching the kids play.</p>
<p><strong>carol sits down not too close. doc is silent for
long</strong>: moments. Carol starts to speak but doesn’t. He is
preoccupied, lost in his own thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>through an open window a portion of the exterior building
can</strong>: BE SEEN… The interior is cozy and Carol. Carol has lived
here almost two years. On the wall there is a poster will be on the wall
of every room that they stay in from now .</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: It doesn’t look like that.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: What do you mean? You’ve never been
there.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I’ve been there every day for the last four
years.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: What’s Beynon got set up?</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Small town, small bank, big money.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Where did you get those?</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: I’ve been doing my homework.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Just like old times?</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Better than old times.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I hope so. I am not looking forward to another
stretch.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: I made a mistake. I’ll never make another
one.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Where did you get them developed?</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Assumed name… Houston.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Half a million.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: That Beynon’s got a long arm.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: What do you want for dinner?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Whisky and a peach.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: How does it taste?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Just the way I remembered.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: You been okay?</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Pretty good… Made a quick trip to Oregon, saw
my brother and the kids. Figured it would be my last chance, unless they
wanted to travel.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: How’s Estelle?</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Fatter… some things never change.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Boring.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Nothing’s been boring since you found me.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: That’s not all of it.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: No. It’s been a long time.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: You go out much?</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: After four years and now the question comes
up.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Couldn’t handle it then. Now I can.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: I’m still here, Doc.</p>
<p><strong>they enter the bedroom and sit side by side on the
double</strong>: bed. They both sit rigidly. Doc’s eyes are on Carol,
she stares vacantly expectant.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Oh Christ…</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I guess I’m kind of…</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: It’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: It’s just been a while.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: We’ve got time. We’ve got a lot of time. I
can help you.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Wait… give me a minute.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I’ll be okay.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Listen, I’m just as nervous as you are.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Really.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Let me make you feel good, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: How was it?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Better than I remembered.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: I was going to fix you breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: You were asleep.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: I bought you a lot of new things.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Yeah, well, I think I’ll stick with what I’ve
got.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Suit yourself.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: How much does Beynon get?</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: $250,000 right off the top.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Is he straight?</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: You got the parole, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Thanks again. I ’m glad you waited.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: I couldn’t have… much longer.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Yeah… I know.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: But I got you out. Didn’t I, Doc. I did it. I
got you out.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Why are you laughing?</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: I laugh when I feel happy. Sometimes just
thinking of you made me laugh. I had a lot of that. And other times that
wasn’t enough. I had a lot of that too. I know you find it hard to
believe, I’m happy just loving you.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: That doesn’t hurt.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: But sometimes I cried a lot too.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I didn’t. I just waited.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Want to cry now?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: You gotta be kidding.</p>
<p><strong>beynon</strong>: Not at all, just a pleasant way to have
lunch.</p>
<p><strong>beynon</strong>: Glad to see you in civilian clothes.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: All it takes is a long arm.</p>
<p><strong>beynon</strong>: Hard to judge how these things happen. The
Parole Board almost never reverses their decisions.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I guess it was because I was a model
prisoner.</p>
<p><strong>beynon</strong>: This is the only time you and I meet in
public. Any business with me, handle it with him…</p>
<p><strong>beynon</strong>: You’re back with your own people now. Got
you some professionals.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I get my own help.</p>
<p><strong>beynon</strong>: You run the job, but I run the show. You got
two weeks to set it up.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: What about them?</p>
<p><strong>beynon</strong>: They’re mine. The one with the moustache is
my brother. They stay out of it. We stay clean.</p>
<p><strong>beynon</strong>: Rudy Butler, Frank Jackson…</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I heard about you. You work with Miller.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: You’re out of touch. Cops blew him up.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Chicago.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: You were with him?</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Yeah. I got out.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: What about you?</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: I was backup man on a payroll job. I hit
some liquor stores… I drive good.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: I drive.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Sure, You’re working on the passports… … and
visas?</p>
<p><strong>beynon</strong>: They will be ready. You guys do your
job.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I’ll take care of my end.</p>
<p><strong>beynon</strong>: Stay clean.</p>
<p><strong>three tripods have been set up near the heavily
curtained</strong>: window. On two of them huge sets of binoculars have
been racked into place, beside them on a tripod is a lectern with
notepad and pencil… Doc and Carol peer through the binoculars then write
several notations on the paper.</p>
<p><strong>back in the hotel room carol and doc continue to eat
while</strong>: making further notations.</p>
<p><strong>carol wearing inconspicuous wardrobe stands quietly in
line</strong>: before a teller’s window.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: I’d like an application for a checking
account.</p>
<p><strong>a table. carol makes out the application as she coolly
and</strong>: unobtrusively eyes the bank.</p>
<p><strong>doc, wearing his suit and glasses, standing at a
teller’s</strong>: window. He moves to the head of the line.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Could I get change for this fifty please?</p>
<p><strong>doc drops a letter into a corner mail box, then buys a
paper</strong>: from a coin dispenser. His eyes find a Beacon City
Policeman idly talking to a citizen… a police car is near the Officer,
the driver’s side door open… mounted on the dash is a shotgun. Doc tucks
the paper under his arm and moves off down the street.</p>
<p><strong>carol cutting pieces of material out of several watch
caps</strong>: with a pair of scissors.</p>
<p><strong>a large room without windows. near the center sits a
big</strong>: table piled with equipment, watch caps, several different
colored raincoats, a huge pair of wirecutters, road maps, chemical
containers and four sticks of dynamite, four visas and two passports and
several padded U.S. Army, super bullet proof vests which are not vests
at all, more a shield.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: … Bank President, three tellers and one
guard…</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Usually on the right side as you go in.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Nail him first, be careful he doesn’t panic and
want to shoot somebody. Local police have one car, a rover, shouldn’t be
in the vicinity at the time we hit unless it’s answering an emergency
call… if the cop car shows up remember it doesn’t have any automatic
weapons. Only a shotgun braced on the dashboard. Get into a tight spot,
you’ll be out of range at forty yards. Then they’re down to their side
guns.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: For exits off Main Street.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Should be light traffic that time of day… the
Bank Guard carries a .38. These will stop an M.2 at fifty yards.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Just in case someone gets a shot off.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: I worked ten years without one, I don’t need
one now.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Suit yourself.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Okay. How many bank exits?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Two.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: What about the vault?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Chambers - Reilly. Time lock opens 20 minutes
before they start doing business…</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Wire pull over?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: One-inch stuff on a three-number
combination.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: I’m good at that.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I ’m handling the fine stuff. You’re back up
all the way…</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Whatever you need.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Keep going over these. I don’t want anybody
getting lost.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: visas held together by a</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I’ll hang on to these. We don’t need them till
we get to Gollie�s. Okay. Any questions?</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Aren’t we going a little hard?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: What do you have in mind?</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: It’s just a walk-in bank. You don’t have to be
Dillinger for this one.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Dillinger got killed.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Tell Beynon I want no mistakes.</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Beynon has to be alone at the drop … one car at
the ranch and that’s it. I won’t have the money… she won’t know where it
is until I’m sure it’s clear.</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: He understands.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Make sure everybody does.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: You know how I feel?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: My mind’s not on guessing games.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Promise you won’t laugh.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: If it’s funny I’m going to laugh.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: I feel like the night before the first day of
school.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: That bad?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: You promised not to laugh.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: It will be such a relief not to have to think
about it any more.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Waiting’s hard. You never learn how.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: You know I’ve actually gotten tired waiting
sometimes… worn out waiting.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: At least you were outside.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: It doesn!t make much difference where you
are, if you’re waiting, Doc.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: I mean it.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I know you do. But it is different. It’s
different. We’ll be all right tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: We are always going to be all right tomorrow.
I’d like to be all right a few todays.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: We’re going to have a lot of those, We’re just
going to get the money and then go all the way.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: … and live happily ever after.</p>
<p><strong>doc’s hands - setting a bomb-timing mechanism attached to
two</strong>: STICKS of dynamite, two tubes of Naptha, a lot of prima
cord and one small, dark percussion cap.</p>
<p><strong>doc is behind carol, at the back of the</strong>: VAN. He
wears a jacket and watch cap. Doc is squatted down, quickly activating
another timing mechanism, checking the clock-face on the bomb against
his wristwatch… with a quick, dexterous movement, he places a bomb into
the two large grocery bags at his feet. After burying the explosives
within each sack, he covers the bombs with crumpled wastepaper.</p>
<p><strong>angles</strong>: The grocery bags are then gently shoved
forward, resting against the wheel well of the truck.</p>
<p><strong>a dapper gentleman in his early fifties walks along
the</strong>: SIDEWALK. He is the PRESIDENT of the First Bank of Beacon
City – nodding to a few passersby, he stops at the front door of the
bank, knocks twice. A BANK GUARD opens the door and the Bank President
moves inside.</p>
<p><strong>jackson - in the hay truck - pulls on a pair of black
gloves,</strong>: then checks his watch.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Two feet forward…</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: Now!</p>
<p><strong>dentist</strong>: Superior technology, my ass.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>walking up the alley - doc pulls on a pair of black
gloves.</strong>: He turns again, now moving down a totallydeserted side
alley.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: 19 seconds.</p>
<p><strong>doc moves towards jackson’s old vantage point near the
side</strong>: DOOR. He passes the bank president.</p>
<p><strong>jackson half runs passing rudy on his way to the
front</strong>: ENTRANCE still watching the Bank Guard.</p>
<p><strong>the bank guard still punch drunk pulls himself up to
his</strong>: HANDS and knees… the Guard looks at his pistol.</p>
<p><strong>doc stops at the kicked in side door. he covers the
entire</strong>: bank with his gun.</p>
<p><strong>the bank guard begins to crawl with agonizing
slowness</strong>: towards his pistol.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Just pick it up.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Don’t!</p>
<p><strong>the alley</strong>: DOC, GUN AND SUITCASE IN HAND, nears the
end of the alleyway.</p>
<p><strong>the ford is several blocks behind rudy. doc
downshifts</strong>: avoiding stalled cars. Carol grasps at both the
seat and the dashboard handholds to maintain her balance.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Where’s Jackson?</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: He didn’t make it, Doc… you didn’t either.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: How did you know?</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: What about the bank?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Jackson panicked and nailed the guard.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Oh, Christ.</p>
<p><strong>dialogue comes on the radio describing the robbery.
$750,000</strong>: stolen.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: We got between four and five.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Doc…</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I see it…</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: They’re looking for three men… remember?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: What’s the problem?</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: I ’m here.</p>
<p><strong>cully</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>hayhoe</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: They checked in.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Call the ranch, tell Beynotr we’ll leave his
cut here –</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: There are three men dead.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: So what. I’ve got to give him his money. That
was our end of the deal.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: He might be ready to chop us up.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Do it my way.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Tell me about Beynon’s ranch.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: I’ve never “been there… When we met it was in
his office.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Do you trust him?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I just figure the percentages. He wouldn’t try
a cross until he’s got the money.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Let’s send his cut back – Just keep
going.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: If we make a mistake., he’ll burn us. You make
a deal, you’re always better keeping your end up.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: I don’t want to go there.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Do it my way.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: You can wait here… I’ll wrap it up fast.</p>
<p><strong>beynon</strong>: Hello, McCoy.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Beynon.</p>
<p><strong>beynon</strong>: News said two persons killed.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Three… Rudy got ambitious.</p>
<p><strong>beynon</strong>: And you got him…</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>beynon</strong>: What about your wife?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: What about her? Let’s c ut up the money, I want
to get North.</p>
<p><strong>beynon</strong>: Your wife told me no one would be
killed.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: You hired Jackson and Rudy., not me.</p>
<p><strong>beynon</strong>: They may nail me into this now, McCoy.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: That’s your problem.</p>
<p><strong>beynon</strong>: You know, you and I may be two of a
kind.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: No way. I always do my own work.</p>
<p><strong>beynon</strong>: Here. I understand the way you feel. As a
matter of fact, you and I might share a great many feelings…</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I’m in a hurry.</p>
<p><strong>beynon</strong>: You still don’t get the picture do you? I’ve
always heard what a smart ass operator you are.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: No applause!</p>
<p><strong>beynon</strong>: Let’s examine the situation. One, an
extremely attractive woman. Then, there’s the woman’s husband, a
skillful bank robber serving a long sentence in prison. Three, a man
with political influence, a man who can easily get a parole for a
convict… why should he?</p>
<p><strong>beynon</strong>: A simple reason, McCoy. The obvious reason.
To rob a bank.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I knew that life didn’t add up to the obvious
when I was 8.</p>
<p><strong>beynon</strong>: What do you add up to here?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: One. The radio’s rappin’ about $750^000. We
only got a half a million.</p>
<p><strong>beynon</strong>: A little more was taken out before. My
brother’s a director of that Bank, Mr. McCoy… I had a few pressing
debts.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: So we did that crackerbox… to cover for
you.</p>
<p><strong>beynon</strong>: The obvious. But we are both not interested
in that right now.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: No. My old lady must have made a lot of
promises.</p>
<p><strong>beynon</strong>: Close… but it takes a hell of a lot more
than promises to pull the kind of strings I pulled.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I bet.</p>
<p><strong>beynon</strong>: You wouldn’t have come here when you were
eight3 Mr. McCoy.</p>
<p><strong>beynon</strong>: Don’t think too badly of her… After all, you
were in jail a long time and she is a healthy young woman.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Get it over with…</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Stupid.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Why didn’t you tell me?</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: There wasn’t any way to explain it.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: You sent me to him.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: When I got out, why didn’t you tell me where it
was?</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: What the hell do you want? Mary Tyler
Moore?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Who’s she?</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: She’s on TV.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: If you don’t start telling the truth…</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: What do we do?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: We keep going.</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: checks his watch momentarily as he prowls the
wagon between long rows of automobiles.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Two day coach tickets – on the Flyer.</p>
<p><strong>ticket-seller</strong>: Thirty-four fifty-six with tax leaves
in forty-five minutes, gate three.</p>
<p><strong>dapper man</strong>: Kind of tricky, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>dapper man</strong>: No trouble lady.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: What’s the damage?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Collar bone is broken. No infection yet… the
bandages should be changed twice a day.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: I got a nurse in mind.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: The glucose will begin working in half an
hour. You’ll feel better then…</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: The three of us are going to do some
traveling. We’re going to take your car to El Paso.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: That’s not possible. We can’t leave here…
we’ve got all this.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Is it possible, Mrs. Clinton?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Just… tell us what you want.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: What kind of car do you have, Harold?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: A Ford… We have a Ford.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: That’s good. That’s very good. Now Harold, you
go out and gas up the Ford, check the oil and tires, we don’t want any
problems on the road. One more thing… If anybody but you comes back…</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: She gets her clock fixed right away… You
understand that, Harold?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: You do what he says, Harold.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: After you come back I’ll listen while you make
some phone calls, tell a few friends you’ve got to leave for a week or
two… You have to call another Vet about the animals. You tell him to
come over and take good care of them starting tomorrow… no slip-ups on
that. They got to be looked after…</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: We really don’t have too many friends.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: They don’t think he married well.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: That makes things a little easier for us then,
doesn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Beer.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Guess you have to catch a train?</p>
<p><strong>the soldier</strong>: pink-cheeked and freckle-faced, he has
to shave maybe twice a week; twenty-one years old, not good-looking and
not a hustler. He just wats to meet a girl.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Me, too. Got twenty-four days of furlough
and I’m goin’ home.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Where’s home?</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Utah, the Bee-Hive state. I’m from Orem,
right near Salt Lake … Say, you wouldn’t happen to be a Mormon, would
you?</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: No, I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Me, neither. There’s about twelve people in
the state that aren’t Mormons and I’m one of them.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: That certainly makes you kind of special…</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Yeah… I guess it does.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: You wouldn’t be taking the train to Salt
Lake, would you?</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: No, I’m afraid not.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: I never have any luck.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: I really hope you have a nice trip.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Thanks. I hope yours is okay, too.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Where’s the suitcase?</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: A man helped me open it…</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: And switched keys.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: He must have.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: It isn’t another boyfriend, is it?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: How long ago.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Fifteen minutes.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Sure?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: He’d figure you for longer, enough time to try
another hit. He’s probably still in the station.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: There better be a guy with the</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: You bastard…</p>
<p><strong>loudspeaker voice</strong>: Attention please.</p>
<p><strong>loudspeaker voice</strong>: The Flyer now boarding at gate
three. The Flyer now boarding at gate three.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: I don’t think you have to worry much about
Harold. He won’t do anything.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: That right?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: You can trust him…</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: How long have you been married?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Two years.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Can he trust you?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: That’s what matters, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Come over here a minute…</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Look, I’m not going to be any trouble to you
either, fact is, this may sound funny, but maybe you and I could be
close friends…</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: You don’t always have to have your gun out.
I’ll get whatever you want. Really, I will…</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Get rid of that nail polish, I don’t like it,
and when I tell you to come over here you move fast. You and I are going
to get along because I’ve known a lot of people like you, so don’t tell
me about it because I got your ticket going in. Now get up and get that
paint of your fingers… okay?</p>
<p><strong>doc looking, moving nimbly into another vestibule and
car.</strong>: The passengers have become fewer and fewer as he nears
the front of the train.</p>
<p><strong>the thief runs through another vestibule and into a
smoker.</strong>: This car also deserted, he maintains his trotting
pace, swinging the heavy suitcase as he goes… reaching the end of the
smoker, he enters the next vestibule and attempts to move into the
following car, but the Thief is brought to a halt by the sudden dead end
of the passageway. The next car holds only baggage. He has reached
furthest forward passenger car. The Thief desperately tries to open the
vestibule door, hoping to escape by jumping off the train, but the doors
are tightly locked. He begins to retrace his steps.</p>
<p><strong>the thief passes back to the vestibule at the rear of
the</strong>: SMOKER, his eye suddenly catching the Men’s Lounge. He
tries the door – locked. The Thief snaps out a pen knife, picks the lock
with a deft movement. Passengers are visible behind him as he works,
filtering into the pullman car following the smoker. None of them notes
his activity. The restroom door swings open.</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: Be open five minutes out of the station.</p>
<p><strong>doc glancing between parked passenger</strong>: CARS, walking
cautiously ahead. As the Flyer continues to move slowly forward, Doc
disappears from view.</p>
<p><strong>doc companionably slides an arm behind the back op
the</strong>: THIEF’S NECK, pulling him close.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: When you pop a lock don’t mark it.</p>
<p><strong>the conductor arrives at the lounge chairs where doc and
the</strong>: thief are seated. He stops in the aisleway, expectantly
leaning in Doc’s direction.</p>
<p><strong>conductor</strong>: Tickets?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: End of the line. Two.</p>
<p><strong>conductor</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Talk a little, Harold, loosen up… good for
you.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Something ought to loosen him up … how comes
we’re going to El Paso, Rudy?</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: I Just want to find a suitcase.</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: They may still be going to Nogales.</p>
<p><strong>swain</strong>: What about Laughlin in El Paso?</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: Cover both, get someone down there…
either Rudy and McCoy’s got half a million.</p>
<p><strong>swain</strong>: They’ve got to switch cars.</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: Put out the word.</p>
<p><strong>hayhoe</strong>: What about Jack?</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: Tonight… take him out in the country,
throw him down a dry well, if you can find one.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Stick ’em up!</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I’m gonna shoot you…</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Come here a second…</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Look, I’m sure you’re a nice kid and that your
mother’s nearby…</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Your kind of mistakes are going to land me back
in Huntsville.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: I wouldn’t worry Doc. I can always get you
out… I’ll screw every prison official in Texas if I have to.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Texas is a big state.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: I can handle it.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I’ll bet you can.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: You’d do the same for me, wouldn’t you, Doc?
If I was caught, wouldn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: When we had trouble before it was
different.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: You don’t like the way things are, I don’t like
the way things</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: What do you want to do?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Maybe we should split up… I’ll cut the money
with you.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Do you mean that?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I mean it.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: No… I don’t want to leave.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: We’ll grab a room for tonight then you go out
tomorrow and buy yourself some new clothes, pick some up for me… Grab
some food now, paper bag it, we eat in the room.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: You’ve got all the answers. What about when
they find the body on the train?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: When they find it, they find it.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: You’ve got it all figured.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: No… there’s a couple of things I’m still
working on.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>carol is busy unbanding the money pads. a large stack
of</strong>: discarded wrappers have been placed in a metal trash can
near her leg. Behind her, Doc, now in his undershirt, reads a Texas
newspaper.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: There may be a hunting party.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Why, there’s nothing on the news?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I didn’t mean police.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Tell me about it.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Loredo is out. I’ve been thinking about Rudy.
If he was on his own, we’re okay. If Beynon bought him out…</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: If Beynon bought him out, and he talked then
maybe Beynon’s boys will be waiting for us in El Paso.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: You’re full of ifs.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I think you liked it with him.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Maybe. At least I got to him. Where do we go
from here?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: El Paso.</p>
<p><strong>a water pistol appears around the corner of an
empty</strong>: PASSENGER CHAIR. The seven year old brat squeezes off
several plumes of water. The Thief is hit by the gun’s spray, water runs
slowly down his ear and the back of his neck.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Bang!</p>
<p><strong>thief</strong>: Get me a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>plainclothes officer</strong>: Where did you get it?</p>
<p><strong>thief</strong>: It was a gift.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Thanks. You look great, just great…</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: That would be the first time.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: When are you going to learn?</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: I did I killed a man.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: And that could be all for you., baby.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Now you learn3 this time it could be the chair
for both of us.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: From now on you just shut up and do as you’re
told.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: If I hadn’t killed Beynon., you would
have.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: How about him?</p>
<p><strong>thief</strong>: Listen, I’m a friend of the Court.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: You are here because you’re under
arrest.</p>
<p><strong>radio</strong>: … The man has been positively identified as
Carter Doc” McCoy, only recently paroled from a penitentiary where he
was serving time for armed robbery. He is believed to be travelling with
his wife, Carol Ainsley McCoy…</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: How you doing over there, Harold? You sleep
okay last night? Good. I’m glad to hear it. Did you listen to the news?
That means we don’t have to drive so hard today, Harold… we’re gonna be
travelling a lot faster than they are… We got a lot more time than I
figured.</p>
<p><strong>cannon</strong>: You Laughlin?</p>
<p><strong>laughlin</strong>: Yes, sir, and that’s my wife and that’s
Junior.</p>
<p><strong>cannon</strong>: Congratulations. I need a room.</p>
<p><strong>laughlin</strong>: No trouble. You came to the right place,
one thing we got is a lot of rooms. What else can I do for you?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: C’mon workl I C’mon.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Give me the news!!</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: You can’t trust anything these days.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: I’ll tell you something, Doc. One day you’re
going to have to trust somebody…</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I trust… Want to see what I trust… In God we
trust… The word’s on every bill!!!</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: You keep it up and it won’t matter how far we
get away, because it’s going to be all over between you and me. Do you
understand that? There won’t be anything left.</p>
<p><strong>as it leisurely moves along the roadway bordered by miles
of</strong>: SAGEBRUSH. Harold drives, Fran is again in the front seat
beside her husband… a scrunched up sack of food beside her. She wipes
her mouth with a napkin, shoves it inside the paper bag, then turns to
watch the passing scenery. Rudy sits in the back, eating spareribs. He
suddenly throws a just finished bone at Fran, hitting her on the
shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Have a bone, baby.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Oh, Christ, you wrecked my blouse.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: I’ll tell you why I did it… it makes me feel
good.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: A portable.</p>
<p><strong>proprietor</strong>: Transistor?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>proprietor</strong>: 15 to 55 dollars – take your pick.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Fifty –</p>
<p><strong>proprietor</strong>: You have change.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: We got trouble. Let’s take a walk.</p>
<p><strong>salesman</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Sure can. I’d like an Invicta 12-gauge pump
with the twenty-inch barrel.</p>
<p><strong>salesman</strong>: All right. Shells?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Two boxes of double-ought buck.</p>
<p><strong>salesman</strong>: Gonna knock down a wall?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Might try that.</p>
<p><strong>salesman</strong>: Sign here.</p>
<p><strong>at the counter the salesman lays out the gun and the boxes
of</strong>: SHELLS. As Doc empties the loose shells into his coat
pocket:</p>
<p><strong>salesman</strong>: Be one hundred and eighty-five thirty-
two.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Much obliged.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Only one car.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Let’s do it.</p>
<p><strong>carol stands frozen as homer and jethro hop out of the
police</strong>: car, guns drawn.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Slide those guns!</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>doc and carol, running through the cornfield and back up
the</strong>: DIRT road toward the highway. Doc still carries his gun in
the brown wrapping paper. Carol labors with the suitcase as she
runs.</p>
<p><strong>doc wears a sunbeaten leather jacket, reading a
newspaper,</strong>: while leaning against a hot dog stand. One foot
rests on the suitcase. The Invicta has been re-wrapped in a laundry bag.
The paper is filled with news of the robbery and a mug shot of Doc.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: El Paso.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Twenty eight hundred.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Are you hungry?</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Not now.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I’ve got to stop.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: I’ll tell you when.</p>
<p><strong>a frontage road bordering the edge of a good-sized
town.</strong>: Carol now driving,, pulls off the highway and into an
“Oasis” drive-in restaurant.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: That’s okay, honey. Two cheeseburgers; two
coffees and a milkshake.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: How about fries?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Could you roll it up part way?</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Sure thing.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: She made us.</p>
<p><strong>two officers scan the parking lot. the passenger cop
cradles</strong>: a riot gun.</p>
<p><strong>passenger cop</strong>: Mercury.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Now.</p>
<p><strong>carol bringing the car around, she can see the squad
car</strong>: streaking backward. She pulls the wheel to the right and
brings her car across the front of the still stopping Police Car.</p>
<p><strong>carol - screaming as the front and back windshields
shatter</strong>: around her.</p>
<p><strong>the mercury roars down the dark street into the
city’s</strong>: COMMERCIAL SECTION, suddenly slow, makes another sharp
turn - this time through a red light.</p>
<p><strong>down a smaller street filled with shops - carol rounds
the</strong>: CORNER, whips up to the curb - Doc and Carol jump out of
the car. She carries the suitcase, he hangs onto his big gun.</p>
<p><strong>a series op angles as a crusher begins to move towards
them</strong>: INSIDE THE TRUCK. Doc and Carol start to panic, but they
have room enough.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Okay?</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: I think so… I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: It’s not deep.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: No scars?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: No scars.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Don’t scratch it, just rub, you’ll get an
infection.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Do what I tell you, it’s not a game.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: It’s all a game, don’t bother me.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: We better stick here till tonight.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: We’re going to make it.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Sure…</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I want to say something.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: I don’t want to hear it.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Listen to me. It’s hard enough.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Look, what you said yesterday… I guess that was
right. It isn’t worth anything if we don’t make it together.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: I don’t think we can any more… If we ever get
out of here, maybe I should take off…</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: We got this far.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: We’ve come a lot of miles. But we’re not
close to anything.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I guess you’re right.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: I always thought jails make people hard. Not
you. You’re just not tough enough to forget about Beynon. I chose you,
not him.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Either we pick it up or else we leave it right
here. We got to go one way or another.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: No more about Beynon.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Whatever happens it’s over.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Sounds good.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: You want to try with me?</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Things can’t get much worse can they?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I don’t see how.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: You and me.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Can we make it?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: We get to Mexico, we can have a life.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: That’s all I want… It’s the only thing I have
ever wanted.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I’m going to try and get it for you.</p>
<p><strong>rudy is lying in bed reading a newspaper pilled with doc
and</strong>: CAROL. The fact that they have been seen in the North. He
smiles.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Harold, you’ve had ten minutes, get out of
there.</p>
<p><strong>doc and carol huddled together on the floor of the empty
car.</strong>: They hold one another tightly fighting the cold and the
relentless roar of metal wheels.</p>
<p><strong>laughlin</strong>: It’s hard to figure. There’s something
about the composition of the track at Pimlico… You can’t go by the
clock, any speed horse, take a second off any other track in the
country.</p>
<p><strong>laughlin</strong>: … but a speed horse is the only thing that
consistently holds form. They got to let ’em run, dumb God damn trainers
try to rate ’em, just breaks their heart.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Okay, sweetpea, you get two choices. Live or
die.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Do what I tell you, you not only get to live,
but maybe you’ll pick up some money.</p>
<p><strong>laughlin</strong>: Just tell me.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: First things first. Main thing, you work for
me, otherwise I get you. If I don’t, six months from now one of my
friends will.</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: El Paso. Laughlin’s. Rudy’s arrived.</p>
<p><strong>laughlin</strong>: Sure, Doc. I can do it. Just like old
times… Yeah, it’s a nervous way to live.</p>
<p><strong>carol and doc sit on a wooden bench at a park near the
hotel.</strong>: THE BLACK SUITCASE is on the ground.</p>
<p><strong>doc enters and crosses to laughlin who is behind the
desk.</strong>: The switchboard is now vacant.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Jimmy. How’s it going?</p>
<p><strong>laughlin</strong>: Good to see you, Doc. It’s all there,
departure, arrival - everything except the $500.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: How’s Mama and the kids?</p>
<p><strong>laughlin</strong>: Growing – all of them - every day. 318,
you’ll be the only ones on the floor.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: My lady’11 come in in about five minutes. Have
some food sent up in half an hour.</p>
<p><strong>laughlin</strong>: Just sandwiches…</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: When she gets here, have that kid of yours help
her with the suitcase.</p>
<p><strong>laughlin</strong>: He took the day off.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Then you do it.</p>
<p><strong>laughlin</strong>: Can’t leave the desk.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Okay, Grunt, pick it up.</p>
<p><strong>carol emerges through the sliding door and turns down
the</strong>: CORRIDOR. She walks slowly, carrying the heavy suitcase.
Reaching the door to room 31oj Carol knocks rapidly three times, waits,
then raps out two sets of two knocks. The door swings open and Doc
stands within the archway. She enters. Doc shuts the door and slips his
arms around Carol, revealing his .45 automatic in one hand.</p>
<p><strong>on the bed in doc and carol’s room, the suitcase is
now</strong>: CLOSED; the .45 automatic sits beside it… Doc’s overcoat
also lies across the bedpsread, near it the wrapped shotgun. The poster
is again on the wall.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: We’ve got some food coming, should be here any
minute.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Great. I’m going to sleep twelve hours.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Ten. Laughlin’s going to take us across at four
A.M.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Oh, Jesus… how?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Jeep. There’s a dry river bed fifteen miles
east. He takes us to the Mexican side, drops us off at the airfield by
breakfast… we’ve got a 9 o’clock flight.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: I’ll be ready.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Get in the shower. You’ll feel okay.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Whatever you say.</p>
<p><strong>doc stands in the shower, the hard spray breaking over
the</strong>: BACK OF HIS SKULL. Tired, he closes his eyes, rests the
side of his head against the tile.</p>
<p><strong>as the hood drives, swain is beside him in the front,
cully,</strong>: THE ACCOUNTANT AND HAYHOE ride in the back seat.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Get upI Carol’s eyes snap open.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: We’re moving now!</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Laughlin. He’s always got his family around…
that wife and kid of his have to stand by his side to make sure he stays
off the juice and horses.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: So what?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: If they are not here, he must have sent them
away.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: You’re crazy.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Get your clothes on, move your butt.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Sorry. Look, I’m clean. I want to get some
rest.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: It’s your food, I brought up your
sandwiches…</p>
<p><strong>inside 318</strong>: Carol standing near the door., looks at
Doc. He mouths and half-whispers:</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Stall.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Just leave it outside the door… I’m not
dressed right now.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: I can’t do that, ma’am. You have to pay now so
I can pay back the boy that went out and got the food…</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: All right. You’ll have to hold on a minute,
my husband’s in the shower…</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Open it up, it’s me.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Come on, come on.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Who was it?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Just get your clothes on…</p>
<p><strong>the accountant stands at one corner op the reception
counter</strong>: IN THE LOBBY OF LAUGHLINS. Within an alcove behind and
to one side of the desk Cully, Swain and Hayhoe have stretched Laughlin
across the pine desk. The Accountant eyes both the empty lobby and the
entrance to the hotel3 acting as lookout.</p>
<p><strong>cully</strong>: Just tell us the room number.</p>
<p><strong>cully</strong>: Now you want to tell me?</p>
<p><strong>laughlin</strong>: McCoy’s in 318., the other guy’s in
420.</p>
<p><strong>cully</strong>: Sure about that?</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Doc !</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: Out here.</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: Just have her set it down.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: You want it? Come and take it.</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: Get him.</p>
<p><strong>rudy on the third floor again rises like lazarus from
the</strong>: DEAD. His head bloodied from Doc’s heavy pistol, he slowly
wobbles to his feet. Rudy looks down at Fran… she sobs violently, her
back leaning against the wall. Rudy picks up his .44 then stumbles into
the open door of Doc and Carol’s room. He unsteadily crosses to the
bathroom, closes the door.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Jump!</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Drive.</p>
<p><strong>slim</strong>: Suit yourself.</p>
<p><strong>slim</strong>: How was that?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Just fine.</p>
<p><strong>slim</strong>: Where we go in1?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Mexico. I’d like to find a quiet place to
cross.</p>
<p><strong>slim</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Where do we go from here?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I don’t know, airport I guess.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: They will have our description before we can
get a plane.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>slim</strong>: I guess you ain’t gonna shoot me, are you?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I kinda doubt it.</p>
<p><strong>slim</strong>: That’s good… I’ll cooperate, don’t worry about
that… yes sir, I’ve had some trouble with the law myself.</p>
<p><strong>slim</strong>: Three years ago I dynamited some fish at the
reservoir.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Oh my God.</p>
<p><strong>slim</strong>: That little job cost me a hundred dollars…
didn’t even get to keep the fish.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Let’s just get to the border.</p>
<p><strong>slim</strong>: Sure thing, mister, it’s coming right up.
’Bout an hour. Quiet crossing that is.</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: Buenas tardes… Your destination.</p>
<p><strong>slim</strong>: Chihuahua… gonna do some sightseeing.</p>
<p><strong>slim</strong>: Which way?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Juarez - Chihuahua City road.</p>
<p><strong>slim</strong>: Don’t you want to go to the airport?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Not now.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: How long before this car’s hot?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Pull over.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Listen… how much money did you make this
year?</p>
<p><strong>slim</strong>: What’s it to you?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Come on. How much?</p>
<p><strong>slim</strong>: ’Bout five thousand.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: How about if I buy your car for ten grand?</p>
<p><strong>slim</strong>: You serious?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Sure am.</p>
<p><strong>slim</strong>: And I keep my mouth shut?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: That’s what I want.</p>
<p><strong>slim</strong>: I don’t report the car and I don’t know either
of you?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: You got it.</p>
<p><strong>slim</strong>: How about twenty thousand?</p>
<p><strong>-doc</strong>: How about thirty?</p>
<p><strong>slim</strong>: Done, by God.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Pay the man.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: You’re going to have to walk back to the
border.</p>
<p><strong>slim</strong>: Don’t worry about me, I’ll grab a cab… I can
afford it, you know.</p>
<p><strong>slim</strong>: Hope you get to where you’re going.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Thanks. Hope you do too.</p>
<p><strong>slim</strong>: By the way, you’re getting a hell of a car
there, mister.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Well, I paid a hell of a price. Now for God’s
sake keep your mouth shut.</p>
<p><strong>slim</strong>: Wish you hadn’t said that. When Slim
Canfield’s lips are sealed, they’re sealed.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Go with God.</p>
<p><strong>slim</strong>: One thing though… how do I explain this to my
wife?</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Tell her you robbed a bank…</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Are we going to make it?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Hell, I don’t know… but we sure gave it a
run.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Whatever happens… we’re going all the
way.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Yeah, why not? We’re the good guys.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: I guess we are.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Why don’t you try the news?</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: No more news, from now on we’re just going to
listen to music.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: What now?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: We walk.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>black panther</strong>: Bang!</p>
