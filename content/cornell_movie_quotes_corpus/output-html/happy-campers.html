<p><strong>a screenplay</strong>: BY DANIEL WATERS</p>
<p><strong>here is an early draft of the screenplay.</strong>: IT
FEATURES A HIKE INSTEAD OF A HURRICANE AND A SINGLE GOD-LIKE NARRATOR
INSTEAD OF A SERIES OF SUBJECTIVE, IN-CHARACTER NARRATORS. THERE’S A LOT
MORE PETER STORMARE IN THIS.</p>
<p><strong>for the online text version of this early draft,</strong>:
ALL “DELETED SCENES” AND “DELETED DIALOGUE” WILL BE MARKED WITH
RIGHT-MARGIN BRACKETS: —-&gt; ]</p>
<p><strong>differences in dialogue (rewrites, etc), slight</strong>:
CHANGES TO ACTION, LOCATIONS, AND ANY RE-ORDERING OR “CHOPPING UP” OF
SCENES ARE NOT MARKED AT ALL.</p>
<p><strong>ext. the lake of the camp–day ]</strong>: ] A brief, majestic
trek across a placid lake to…discarded ] life jackets on a barren
pier…canoes capsized next to ] abandoned sand castles. ]</p>
<p><strong>int. empty cabin–day ]</strong>: ] An unsettling glide
through a cabin packed with overflowing ] trunks and torn apart
bunks…empty of children. ]</p>
<p><strong>int. cafeteria–day ]</strong>: ] A cafeteria looming like a
ghost ship, bereft of people, ] but decked out in the gooey remains of a
food fight. ]</p>
<p><strong>the smooth voice of a narrator</strong>: It was the first
summer of the 21st century. Wendy, Wichita, Talia, Donald, Adam, Jasper,
and Pixel were to spend it as camp counselors. The world would be
changed forever. Kind of. Not really.</p>
<p><strong>harsh loudspeaker voice (o.s.) ]</strong>: …no smoking, no
drinking, no ] climbing the mountain, no cursing, ] no playing
favorites, no sexuality ] of any possible dimension… ] ] Irreverently
ignoring the harsh voice, the instantly ] charismatic WICHITA and his
overwhelmingly acerbic college ] pal, TALIA, entertain themselves over
the workbooklet cover. ] ] TALIA ] Am I the only one disturbed by this ]
cover? The way counselor’s holding ] his weenie… ] ] WICHITA ] …the way
the camper is holding ] his little bun. Total Kiddie porn. ] ] An almost
painfully adorable fellow counselor, later to be ] revealed as WENDY,
turns to give them a Sh-h-h gesture ] causing them to further unmuffle
their giggling. ] ] HARSH LOUDSPEAKER VOICE ] …and to quote the moving
words ] of the workbooklet: “You’ll learn ] the true meaning of
responsibility ] while creating memories that last ] a lifetime.” ] ]
WICHITA AND TALIA ] Wow. ]</p>
<p><strong>wendy and campers</strong>: “Aye-aye-aye-aye, in China they
never grow chilly, So sing me another verse that’s worse than the first
and make sure it’s foolish and silly…”</p>
<p><strong>smooth narrator</strong>: Rightly or wrongly, for better or
worse, the counselors defined themselves quickly. No one more so than
Wendy. First week of camp, the perky girl who knows all the rules and
all the songs is pretty much Queen.</p>
<p><strong>ext. the woods–flash forward day ]</strong>: ] Wendy looks up
a wiggling rope, cheering an unseen climbing ] camper. The Camper body
SLAMS down out of frame. Wendy aims ] a “Don’t give up” cheer downward.
]</p>
<p><strong>smooth narrator</strong>: Wendy’s monarchy of relentlessly
daisy-fresh enthusiasm could not possibly last. Or could it?</p>
<p><strong>ext. center of camp–flash forward dusk ]</strong>: ] Wendy is
lowering a flag reading DAY 4 while booming out ] a hymn to camp spirit.
A semi-circle of other counselors ] stare dumbfounded. ] ] COOL
COUNSELOR WICHITA ] Uh, Wendy dear, the kids are back ] in the cabins… ]
] WENDY ] Oh please, you silly geese, like ] you need to be a child to
do the ] sing-a-long… ] ] Wendy re-blasts into song. Snorting out
smiling surrender, ] the other counselors slowly warble along with her.
]</p>
<p><strong>upper income latino kid ]</strong>: You’re one of those
charity kids, ] aren’t you? The newspaper sends a ] bunch of broke kids
to camp every ] year. You’re one of them. I can ] tell. ] ] LOWER INCOME
LATINO KID ] Why are you talking shit–I’m not ] one of them. ] ] The
bespectacled, profoundly geeky DONALD DARK, lowers a ] clipboard before
the Lower Income Boy. ] ] DONALD DARK ] Hey Hector, I just need you to
check ] this box so the people at the ] Oregonian Send A Kid To Camp
Fund ] know you got here safe and sound. ] ] The Upper Income Spanish
Kid detonates in an “Aah” of ] laughter. The Lower Income Spanish Kid
glumly checks the ] paper and makes a surly exit. Donald comprehends the
] situation with an agonized body heave. He wallops the ] clipboard
against his forehead then turns to a NASTY GIRL. ]</p>
<p><strong>nasty camper girl</strong>: This camp sucks shit! A good
counselor is supposed to know when we eat and where are the horses and
why–Fu– uck!</p>
<p><strong>smooth narrator</strong>: Donald Dark liked to think of
himself as a witty, intelligent young man trapped in a geek’s body.</p>
<p><strong>ext. the grass before the archery range–flash forward day
]</strong>: ] Donald claps his hands trying to rouse his volleyball
team. ] A ball thunders right into his face. His team bursts into ]
laughter. Donald weakly smiles. ]</p>
<p><strong>smooth narrator</strong>: Unfortunately, and Donald Dark had
known this for years, a witty, intelligent young man in a geek’s body is
still a geek.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: I had a sleepwalker at my last camp.
Important thing’s not to panic…so anyway, like I was saying, once the ]
campers found out my full name was ] Donald Dark, their brilliant minds
] led them to call me Donald Dark Duck, ] which turned into Daffy, for
Daffy ] Duck is indeed a dark duck. Then ] my name became Retarded
Marshmallow ] Head. Don’t ask… ] ] MALE COUNSELOR ] I won’t. Listen man,
I’m sure this ] summer will be a lot different… ] ] A group of smiling
male campers are revealed to be sinisterly ] huddled at a window behind
them. ] ] EAVESDROPPING MALE CAMPER ] “Retarded Marshmallow Head.” I
like ] it. I like it a lot. ]</p>
<p><strong>a female african-american counselor of extreme competence
]</strong>: sails past Donald to deftly gauze the nasty, nosebleeding ]
girl. Donald spins away right into Talia. She snickers as ] he scrambles
away. ]</p>
<p><strong>talia</strong>: You look a like you could use a friend. You
know, I’ll never forget my first day at camp. Boy, I was so nervous that
I…</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Hey–whaddya say, we need another muskrat to
join our Sunshine circle. Scurry up! Isn’t Fun great!</p>
<p><strong>talia ]</strong>: So much for that child psychology ] class
we took last semester. ] ] WICHITA ] I warned you, Talia–Childhood has ]
got nothing to do with children. ] ] TALIA ] How can you compete with
“Isn’t Fun ] great?” ]</p>
<p><strong>smooth narrator</strong>: Talia liked kids. In theory. Talia
liked nature. In pictures. Talia was city-cigarette-cynicism temporarily
located 72 miles outside of Portland for one reason: Him.</p>
<p><strong>ext. the lake–flash forward day ]</strong>: ] AN UNSTOPPABLY
MUTTERING CAMPER GIRL is glommed to the side ] of Talia, who is standing
in the lake, staring out to a ] shirtless Wichita playing frisbee in the
wind. ] ] UNSTOPPABLY MUTTERING GIRL ]
It-was-just-like-summer-camp-except- ]
it-was-on-a-farm-in-Canada-and-nobody- ]
wore-any-clothes-Guess-how-many-rated- ] R-movies-I’ve-seen?-Three-The-
] Shawshank— ] ] Not breaking visual contact with Wichita, Talia firmly
dunks ] the Muttering Girl’s talking head beneath the water. ] ] SMOOTH
NARRATOR ] Wichita, the gorgeous gentile with ] the only bullshit
detector cranked ] as high as hers was. She loved him ] from the moment
he moved into the ] dorm. For a chance to deepen their ] friendship,
Talia would have done ] anything. Unfortunately, summer ] camp has a way
of redefining the ] word “anything.” ] ] Talia plucks back up the
Muttering Girl who sputters some ] water then picks up where she left
off. ] ] UNSTOPPABLY MUTTERING GIRL ]
Redemption-Repo-Man-Schindler’s-List— ] all rated R.
My-favorite-food-is- ] Chinese-food, my-second-favorite- ] food is…
]</p>
<p><strong>talia</strong>: College was entertaining, Wichita, but after
40 days and 40 nights of this, I really think we’re going to get to know
each…</p>
<p><strong>wichita</strong>: Ooh look, time to confiscate my first water
balloon…</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: What’s wrong with you little vaginas? Weak!
Next!</p>
<p><strong>ext. somewhere else in the woods–day ]</strong>: ] Adam is
leading his young “troops” in a boot camp trot down ] a forest trail.
]</p>
<p><strong>smooth narrator</strong>: Adam needed little elaboration. As
a child, he tasted the whip. Now, after years of waiting, it was Adam’s
turn to crack it.</p>
<p><strong>adam ]</strong>: This cabin needs to be a tight unit ] of
pure strength. You don’t need ] courage when you have no fear… ] ] BOLD
TWELVE YEAR OLD LOUDMOUTH ] Man, you’re such a cliche. ] ] Adam brakes.
So do the rest of the campers. Adam calmly turns ] to the loudmouth and
smiles. ]</p>
<p><strong>smooth narrator</strong>: Like any good fascist, Adam truly
believed his brand of counseling was not sinister, but rather for the
camper’s own good.</p>
<p><strong>ext. yet another part of the forest–fast forward day
]</strong>: ] Boy and Girl Campers are laughing at a tree. The viewer
spins ] around the bark to see that the Loudmouth Kid has been nailed ]
high on the tree by his underwear in the most painfully ] graphic wedgie
of all time. ]</p>
<p><strong>adam ]</strong>: Excellent! Now that’s the focus I ] want to
see this summer! Next! ] ] Wichita drifts by the bus, oblivious to the
sight of another ] hapless kid being slammed to the dirt by swooshing
luggage. ] Wichita stops at the tangle of the still-clutching-the-bus
Crying Boy and a struggling-to-remove-him counselor, the sensitive but
subversive JASPER.</p>
<p><strong>wichita</strong>: Cinnamon or spearmint or both?</p>
<p><strong>wichita</strong>: Go stand by the flagpole.</p>
<p><strong>jasper</strong>: Sorry about all that…I’m your CIT–
Jasper.</p>
<p><strong>wichita</strong>: When all else fails, Jasper–Gum. Even now
in these troubled times, ] every child’s drug of choice. ]</p>
<p><strong>smooth narrator</strong>: Jasper was seemingly shy, but
actually sly. A lot more than met the eye.</p>
<p><strong>int. hallway outside of mess hall–future night ]</strong>: ]
Fighting back tears, a LIP-BITING, HEAD-DOWN MALE CAMPER ] HANGS UP a
pay phone. He turns to Jasper, who calms him with ] a soothing tone.
Head rising, the boy departs. Jasper then ] turns into a hug from a
WEEPING GIRL hanging up another pay ] phone. ]</p>
<p><strong>smooth narrator</strong>: Jasper was the sensitive counselor,
the one the campers seeked out to discuss the biggies. He had an uncanny
ability to notice pain and get it in the open. “In the open” was
Jasper’s favorite place to be.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: I mean, how far could she have..</p>
<p><strong>jasper</strong>: I’m gay. I could tell people were getting
this “sexually confused” vibe from me. I’m not. I’m straight- up
fairy…but don’t freak out, I’m not attracted to either of you…</p>
<p><strong>wichita ]</strong>: ] There’s no reason to be rude… ]</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: Well. Gay. Gay’s great. I mean, I’m not, you
know, but hey, if you, I mean–</p>
<p><strong>seriously troubled boy</strong>: She touched me! She touched
me!</p>
<p><strong>wichita</strong>: Meet Todd! From our cabin!</p>
<p><strong>smooth narrator</strong>: The gung-ho cute counselor…The
hard-ass control freak…the sensitive gay counselor…and then there were
those who could not be glibly categorized. To name one…Pixel.</p>
<p><strong>pixel</strong>: Come on, this isn’t the hokey-pokey, a-che
the body…that’s it…Let’s hear some noise out there! The ladies dance for
tips and tips only!</p>
<p><strong>stripping girl ]</strong>: How’s this empowering, again?
]</p>
<p><strong>pixel</strong>: No, no, not one arm at a time, grab the
bottom of the shirt with both hands, that’s it. Feel the heat…</p>
<p><strong>lookout girl</strong>: Wendy!</p>
<p><strong>campers</strong>: A movie…two words…first word…sounds
like…</p>
<p><strong>int. wendy and pixel’s cabin–future day ]</strong>: ] Wendy
again gives off an uncomprehending stare. This time ] toward Pixel
meticulously painting strangely erotic tattoos ] on a line of their
cabin’s girls. ]</p>
<p><strong>smooth narrator</strong>: Pixel gleefully answered all the
dirty questions a good counselor would uncomfortably ignore. It was
dangerous to try and figure Pixel out. She herself wisely never tried.
Others would.</p>
<p><strong>smooth narrator</strong>: As strange as Pixel may have
seemed, the camp’s real wild card was Wichita.</p>
<p><strong>ext. center of camp–future day ]</strong>: ] Two groups of
Campers rip on the same rope in a vicious bout ] of tug of war.
Veins-a-poppin, Adam wails at his team on ] one side while Wichita
calmly traverses next to his group. ]</p>
<p><strong>smooth narrator</strong>: Here was a someone who did not care
about workbookleted activities. Here was someone who had anarchy in his
eyes. Here was someone. Period. He played it low-key that first
week…</p>
<p><strong>wichita ]</strong>: Now. ] ] Wichita’s team
immediately-giddily lets go of the rope, ] sending Adam’s “winning” team
into an ugly crash. ]</p>
<p><strong>smooth narrator</strong>: No one could see into Wichita’s
soul, but at least it was clear that he had one. He had an effect on
everyone, even those thought to have no feelings…</p>
<p><strong>smooth narrator</strong>: A collection of individuals
separated from regular society eventually becomes something more than a
collection of individuals separated from regular society. It becomes one
mammoth living organism. Different traits of different people feeding
off and flowing into each other–the naive and the perverse, the brutal
and the sweet, the overconfident and the overwhelmed– all coming
together to form one singularly special whole.</p>
<p><strong>smooth narrator</strong>: An organism made up of 70 screaming
kids counseled by young adults at the most fucked-up point in their
lives is a monster well worth a glance. Welcome to Camp Bleeding
Squaw.</p>
<p><strong>oberon</strong>: Campers, welcome to Camp Bleeding Squaw! I’m
Big Chief Oberon. Fun. I like it. You think I don’t? I do. But Fun
without structure is chaos and chaos is not fun–Now everybody rip off
their band-aid!</p>
<p><strong>oberon</strong>: Yes! It has begun! I declare war! Color
War!–all the way to our Fortieth Day! Welcome to the thrill of
competition and the joy of making others cry. I want Reds here, Greens
there, Blue across from them and the Purple team against the
flagpole!</p>
<p><strong>oberon</strong>: This new turn of events brings up an
interesting question: Who’s got more Camp pride?</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: Something tells me he can’t hear us.</p>
<p><strong>oberon</strong>: I can’t he–ar you!</p>
<p><strong>wichita</strong>: Not bad, Donald Dark.</p>
<p><strong>oberon</strong>: One more time!</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Red! Red! Whoopsy.</p>
<p><strong>oberon</strong>: Haven’t you people ever seen an epileptic
camper before?– Counselors, get these Injuns into the cabins and then
onto the Activities! Fun! Now! Move it!</p>
<p><strong>oberon</strong>: But even more than the taste of S’mores, he
enjoyed the taste of camper flesh.</p>
<p><strong>the campers</strong>: Ooooh!</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Well, the first week of camp has swhooshed on
by and I thought this a perfect time to finally pow-wow. I think we
should discuss–</p>
<p><strong>talia</strong>: We need more ritalin. Can’t we just grind it
into the munchkins’ food?</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: I’m having “Billy” problems again. He turned
today’s food fight into a fork fight.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: You have no authority. To get camper respect,
you must…</p>
<p><strong>wendy ]</strong>: Now Adam, I had a chat with one of ] our
campers–Nathan King–he seems ] to think your methods of earning ]
respect are severe and what’s more… ] ] ADAM ] “Nathan King”–he’s the
redhead, ] right? I’ll make it up to him. ]</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Instead of getting all mad at Donald’s
Tasmanian Devil Billy, have you people ever thought of getting all
<u>glad</u> at him– making him feel a part of things. The workbooklet
says…</p>
<p><strong>wichita</strong>: Don’t mean to interrupt, Wendy dear, but
isn’t that the little buckaroo eating a sandwich of communion hosts…</p>
<p><strong>talia</strong>: Who wants to go tell the Anti-christ to take
a “time-out?”</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Talia, just because you happen to be Jewish,
doesn’t mean you can make fun of someone desecrating the Lord’s
body…</p>
<p><strong>talia</strong>: Yes, it does.</p>
<p><strong>wichita ]</strong>: Don’t look at me, I’m an atheist. ] ]
WENDY ] Really? I think we should discuss… ] ] ADAM ] Could we please
stop the petty ] religious sniping? We have much more ] important things
to deal with–like ] what are we going to do about that ] fag? It’s one
thing if Jasper was ] one of those Birdcage kind of homos. ] We could
laugh and make fun of him, ] but Jasper… ]</p>
<p><strong>pixel</strong>: The workbooklet says this is a summer camp,
not a concentration one, you homophobic Nazi cunt.</p>
<p><strong>adam ]</strong>: Listen hippie-chick, put yourself ] in the
place of a parent who finds ] out their only child got AIDS by ]
drinking the camp bug juice. ] ] EVERYONE ] ] What an asshole… ] ]
DONALD ] Besides we all got tested at the ] Camp physical…positive is
good, ] right? ] ] WENDY ] Now Adam, me fearing Jasper with ] the little
boys would be like me ] fearing you with the little girls. ] ] PIXEL ]
Bad example. ] ] ADAM ] Funny. ] ] WICHITA ] Oh my God, wait, Adam’s
right, look ] at that sick son-of-a-bitch… ]</p>
<p><strong>oberon</strong>: …and on Parent’s Day, the campers rushed
from their cabins to see the corpses of their slaughtered parents nailed
to the picnic tables…</p>
<p><strong>the campers</strong>: Oooh.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Okay, okay, just don’t everyone talk at
once…First of all, little Jason has a learning disability…</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: Yeah, his lack of intelligence. Sorry,
Wendy, but as learning disabilities go, stupidity is often
overlooked.</p>
<p><strong>talia ]</strong>: Which Jason are we talking about? ] Jason
W., Jason T., Jason T. Two? ] ] PIXEL ] I got a letter from Grace Pool’s
] parents telling me that they’re going ] to be too busy to write her
any letters. ] ] TALIA ] Jason, Jared, Justin, Jacob, Jesse, ] Jaime,
Jeremy, Jeffrey, Josh–Jesus ] Christ, this J shit has gotta stop. ] ]
WENDY ] ] I have a sample of Grace’s parents’ ] handwriting on file.
I’ll forge ] something up…Adam, I tracked down ] that special soap for
Troy. ]</p>
<p><strong>wichita</strong>: Wendy, I think as a counselor, you
suck.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: What did you…</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: That’s cold, man.</p>
<p><strong>wichita</strong>: Next to “boring,” “Sucks” is the most
painfully overused word in the current English language. I thought if I
could reverse the meaning of “sucks” so it means something positive, I
don’t know…It would be vaguely revolutionary. It’s kind of my social
experiment for the summer. “Suck” is historically a nice word–
sno-cones, your mother’s…</p>
<p><strong>wendy ]</strong>: ] So <u>that’s</u> one of the pearls from ]
your mysterious journal? And all this ] time I thought you were
restructuring ] the world’s economy. ]</p>
<p><strong>pixel</strong>: Ugh, is anybody paying attention to what Big
Chief Oberon is saying…</p>
<p><strong>oberon</strong>: And as the stench of complete and utter
death rose above the camp, the birdies began to choke and drop from
the…</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: He-ey, what happened to the fire while I was
gone? I think we need some kindling, campers, and pronto!</p>
<p><strong>a moving off camper ]</strong>: Thanks, Retarded Marshmallow
Head. ] ] DONALD ] You’re welcome…Hey, what did you ] just call me…Who
told…Hey! ]</p>
<p><strong>wichita</strong>: What in the hell did you do that for?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: I-unno…Don’t worry, I had everything on the
hand memorized.</p>
<p><strong>wichita</strong>: That’s not what I was worried about.</p>
<p><strong>talia</strong>: Are we allowed to start hating “Wendy”
yet…“Gee Wichita, I guess mosquitoes have always liked me.”</p>

<p><strong>beach panorama ]</strong>: ] As the Smooth Narrator chimes
in, the sunbathing girls ] breathlessly look from waving Wendy to waving
Wichita. The ] boys surrounding Wichita do the same. A co-ed group of ]
counselors and campers halt their horseplay in the water ] to watch the
waving. ]</p>
<p><strong>smooth narrator</strong>: Some liked the cookouts, some liked
the water sports, but the one activity everyone had an interest in was
watching the attractive and attracted opposites of Rulemaker Wendy and
Rulebreaker Wichita. They were becoming the heart of the organism,
pumping blood to its every pore.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: But camp has only really just begun…</p>
<p><strong>sandcastle girl #1</strong>: It’s in-veta, in-never–it’s just
natural. Wendy’s the hottest girl and Wichita’s the smokingest guy.</p>
<p><strong>sandcastle girl #2</strong>: It’s fun to watch them get
together, isn’t it? It’s just like a movie.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: Haven’t you seen movies where the beautiful
girl realizes–“Hey, maybe I don’t have to be with the most foxy hunk in
the world, you know, maybe that nice, caring guy, the one the others
sometimes call”nerd”– Maybe he’s the one who–”</p>

<p><strong>oberon</strong>: Wichita…I should have known this was going
to happen! Et tu, Wendy? And look at all of you, the giddy witnesses! I
command a complete camp lockdown until <u>dawn</u>! No one is to leave
their cabin and no one is to say one word about this incident or the

Would you rather climb a forty- ] foot pile of boogers or swim through ]
a pool of that stuff that’s in your ] eyes when you wake up? ]</p>
<p><strong>ryan, the all-american boy</strong>: Hey, how long do we have
to keep up this queasy massage shit?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Man, didn’t you listen to Wichita? If you ever
want to be with a girl, instead of just talking about it, Massage
ability is key.</p>
<p><strong>stanley, eric’s short pal</strong>: This sucks.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Thanks, I know. Wichita says that everyone
cool knows that “sucks” is a good word now.</p>

them, except one of them has full-blown Aids, and you don’t know who.
And you’re not allowed to use a condom.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: Call me conservative, but I’d rub my penis
on the faces of all the ladies before bestowing the final honors to the
divine Ms. Berry’s lovely visage.</p>

fast.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: I’m not really a–Does it count if…</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: You either have or you haven’t. It’s
pass/fail, Daffy.</p>
<p><strong>big drunken stoner lug</strong>: It’s okay, Donald Dark dude,
I’m waiting until I find the right girl, myself…</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: “The right girl?” I thought we were talking
about sex. Pardon my French, the right girl means one avec a pussy. Guys
are different. You know how a girl feels like a whore if the guy’s only
in it for the poon. What women fail to understand is that a man feels
equally ashamed if the relationship is based on just talking and sharing
feelings.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: Do you realize if the women of America would
have just heard what you said…</p>
<p><strong>wichita</strong>: They wouldn’t be a bit surprised..</p>

They’re all bitches.</p>

<p><strong>talia</strong>: You know what I hate; a woman says yes to
going out to dinner wich-you, right? Orders chips and salsa and
appetizers and shit. Then on the way home when you whip it out, she gets
all…</p>

<p><strong>african-american super-counselor</strong>: Sorry G. Now I
ain’t going down on no woman. Belly button low as I go.</p>

<p><strong>talia</strong>: Man asswipe, you made my enormous cock fall
off…</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: I don’t know about you dickweeds, but I gotta
go take a nice, long juicy dump.</p>
<p><strong>african-american super-counselor</strong>: Wendy, men aren’t

<p><strong>jasper</strong>: Oh God…that’s it? I’m “the gay guy.” Every
time I walk into a room, everyone is going to…</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Hey, nobody asked you to be a homosexual. You
can’t complain about being treated gay when you are gay. While we’re on
the subject, do you have your Camp physical results?</p>
<p><strong>jasper</strong>: The only toxic asshole in this cabin is
you…Wichita, Wichita, why are you hanging around with us clowns, when
you know you how badly Wendy wants to be your wonderwall…</p>
<p><strong>big drunken stoner log</strong>: The gay guy–I mean, Jasper’s
right. You and Wendy bring out the romantic in all of us.</p>
<p><strong>wichita</strong>: Gee guy, coming from you,
that’s..disturbing. Wendy and I…come on. I believe in nothing. She
believes in everything. I listen to Reznor, she listens to Barney. I
watch…</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: Man, you’re doth protesting way too much.
Admit you want her.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: In case you haven’t noticed, the entire camp

frog…</p>
<p><strong>wichita</strong>: Listen you Vikings, Wendy’s still very
young and inexperienced and I have to respect…</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: If no one had sex with a girl because she was
a virgin–you know where I’m going with this.</p>
<p><strong>jasper</strong>: You are to be executed at Dawn anyway. Might
as well commit the crime. Go to her, Wichita…</p>
<p><strong>wichita</strong>: You’re all making me blush…</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Me and Wichita? Don’t be ridiculous. That guy
thinks he’s so “alternative” with all his brooding and his…He’s hardly
uninteresting, but…</p>

and contagious. The kids don’t understand that this is our summer, too.
We shouldn’t have to put our lives on hold to be their butlers.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: I just don’t know about this whole actual

<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Oh you know, Bosnia, the importance of the
right to vote…</p>
<p><strong>wichita</strong>: Yeah, we talked about sex, too. Oberon must

<p><strong>wichita</strong>: Talia’s a rock. She’ll be fine…</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Ann Taylor would have paid a lot more, but I
wouldn’t trade this experience for the world. Sometimes the first time
you understand anything is when you have to explain it to someone
younger– You think I’m a big dork don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>wichita</strong>: I think your passion is terrific.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: I think your condescension is even
better.</p>
<p><strong>wichita</strong>: We have more in common than you think,
Wendy dear. I loved summer camp when I was young and I love it now. It’s
important. Between school, family, friends, pot, playstations, basic
cable, and the goddamn Internet, it’s possible to go your whole life
without listening to your soul. Out here, in nature, away from the shit,
surrounded by reminders of who I once was…I get recharged. Now who’s the
dork?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Gosh, this is really a great conversation–I
can’t believe I said that out loud.</p>

] Wichita exhales through his teeth and rises all the way up ] to look
out into the night. He turns to Wendy. ] ] WICHITA ] I don’t believe in
organized ] religion, organized school, and ] organized summer camp. I
don’t ] believe cigarette advertisements ] have ever caused a single
teenager ] to take up smoking. Premature death ] sells itself. I find
Catcher in the ] Rye a bit whiny, and much prefer ] Franny and Zooey… ]
] WENDY ] When you say you don’t believe in ] organized summer camp… ] ]
WICHITA ] Timetables. Workbooklets. Minus four ] for the blue team… ] ]
Not used to such combat, Wendy wobbles to her legs. ] ] WENDY ] I’ll
agree to a degree of ] overregimentation here at Bleeding ] Squaw, but
kids need to be guided ] through well-established rituals ] of teamwork
and verbal reinforcement. ] ] WICHITA ] That is one frightening
sentence. ] ] WENDY ] Please, that’s the way summer camp ] has worked
for years. ] ] WICHITA ] Please, that’s the way summer camp ] has
<u>not</u> worked for years. The old ] coming-of-age rituals are just ]
so…expired. You think you can just ] throw an arm around these kids’ ]
shoulders and say, “I know how you ] feel. Life is kind of tough. All ]
that I ask is that you be the best ] you can be.” How do you tell my ]
tubby, whiny loser Todd to be the ] best you can be, when the best he
can ] be is probably pretty shitty. Wendy, ] you’re an idealist and
that’s ] wonderful, but an idealist without ] reality is like a great
dancer ] without legs. ] ] WENDY ] Oh. ]</p>
<p><strong>ext. outside the cabins–night ]</strong>: ] Prowling before
the cabins, a glowering Oberon bangs ] batteries into a powerful
flashlight and thunders it on. ]</p>

watches Oberon rumble past the window. ] ] ADAM ] Wichita, you are so
dead… ] ] Losing his smile, Adam sits down and nudges a sleeping ]
Bedwetter Ted awake with his boot. ] ] ADAM ] Sorry about waking you,
Ted…but ] changing your sleep patterns is key ] to avoiding…your
problem. Or so ] I’ve read. It takes time, but I know ] you can do it.

<p><strong>wichita</strong>: So this is it, anybody you don’t agree
about everything with can’t be your friend…</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Iunno.</p>
<p><strong>wichita</strong>: “Iunno.” I’m really beginning to hate that
word of yours. I’m sorry for sounding hostile, but I’m not sorry
for…</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Don’t be. Don’t be sorry for your thoughts.
They make me…react. I don’t know…all I know is that I can’t go through
another summer where I <u>almost</u> did something.</p>
<p><strong>wichita ]</strong>: What does that mean? ] ] WENDY ] It means
you have another opening, ] Slick. ] ] WICHITA ] ] Um, ugh, everything
about you is ] refreshing and the kids love ] you…Shit, um, your eyes
are like ] sapphires on a moonlit desert and… ] ] WENDY ] ] Okay, okay…
]</p>
<p><strong>wichita ]</strong>: Wow, your God really doesn’t want ] us to
happen. ] ] WENDY ] Yeah, well, too bad for him… ] ] In a clumsy attempt
at passion that comes across as even ] more passionate because of its
clumsiness, a rising Wendy ] struggles off her shirt. Wichita
effortlessly peels off his ] and also stands. They crush into each
other’s arms and each ] other’s lips, waltzing off the side of the
staircase, ] disappearing into the darkness of the forest. ]</p>
<p><strong>oberon</strong>: I’m not against the occasional camp romance,
but…I can feel it…Nocturnal Activities. Little rapists and their little
whores…Who goes there?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Rise and Shine, campers and counselors.
Today, unhappiness is not an option. Mess Hall. Nine minutes.
Please.</p>
<p><strong>smooth narrator (v.o.) ]</strong>: Of course after I was hit
by ] lightning, things around the camp ] changed…but not as much one
would ] think. At least not right away…Oh. ] Yes. I’m the narrator. My

<p><strong>int./ext. arts and crafts room–day ]</strong>: ] Wendy is
aggressively marking up some official paperwork. ] She then rises from
the desk to vociferously supervise a ] line of campers making wallets.
She reaches the window where ] she pulls on the head-set, sticks out her
head, and blows ] the whistle– commencing an obstacle course going on
outside. ]</p>
<p><strong>oberon narration</strong>: After the trauma of having her
first significant sexual experience interrupted by her camp director’s
electrocution, Wendy threw herself into her work and my work.</p>
<p><strong>ext. small mountain–day ]</strong>: ] Wichita charges up the
rockage of a small mountain-hill-type ] thing. The image repeats itself
over and over–each time ] Wichita is more sweaty, gasping, sneering. ] ]
OBERON NARRATION ] Wichita threw himself into himself. ] The rules
forbid anyone from the ] climbing the camp’s mountain. It, ] of course,
became Wichita’s favorite ] activity. ]</p>
<p><strong>ext. oberon’s office–night ]</strong>: ] Now highly
uncatatonic, Oberon felines from the door of his ] office structure. ] ]
OBERON NARRATION ] Something deep inside me told me ] that, despite
their retreat into ] Denial, Wichita and Wendy were still ] very fond of
each other. The fact ] that I snuck out every night and ] read their
diaries greatly helped. ]</p>
<p><strong>ext. patch of the woods–night ]</strong>: ] Oberon sits in a
lotus position before a small campfire, ] reading from Wendy’s diary. ]
] VOICE OF WENDY ] Ever since the night of the Evil ] Weirdness, I find
it painful to even ] look at him. Only you, dear diary, ] know just how
much he has changed ] me and how much I feel… ] ] Oberon lowers Wendy’s
girly-girl diary with one hand and ] raises up Wichita’s scruffy journal
with the other. ] ] VOICE OF WICHITA ] I’m not sure I even like Wendy; I
] only know that I love her. Wendy’s ] the only truly surprising person
] I’ve ever met. Why won’t she talk ] to me? Why won’t I talk to her? ]
] Oberon looks to his watch, kicks dirt on the fire, then trots ] back
off into the night. ]</p>
<p><strong>oberon narration</strong>: The would-be lovers were in pain.
Their cabinmates were not much help…</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>pixel</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: You know you just do this for shock value.
It’s not shocking.</p>
<p><strong>pixel</strong>: When did pretending to be bored become a sign
of superiority? Are you mad at me for giving the cabin new haircuts or
are you just still miserably pining for Wichita’s lightning rod?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Geez, what time is it? I have to go feed Big
Chief Oberon…You’re right, I miss him. Wichita, that is. I really want
to be with him, but I can’t bring myself to–Are you a lesbian or are
you…</p>
<p><strong>pixel</strong>: I didn’t realize I had to declare a
major.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Why do you even like me?</p>
<p><strong>pixel</strong>: You remind me of me when I was…I guess I was
never like you. So cute. So questioning.</p>

<p><strong>wichita</strong>: Your Secret admirer?</p>
<p><strong>jasper</strong>: Not so secret anymore. Don’t look all at
once…behind the pine…Dorothy from Cabin Seven.</p>
<p><strong>jasper</strong>: I guess it was too much to ask that it would
somebody older…and maler. Like you.</p>
<p><strong>wichita</strong>: Hey, I thought I wasn’t your type.</p>
<p><strong>jasper</strong>: Wichita–you’re everybody’s type. But
seriously, don’t worry about it. I get my occasional crushes.</p>
<p><strong>wichita</strong>: Hey, it’s not a crush anymore if ] you
actually say it to the person ] you supposedly have the… ] ] JASPER ]
Thought I’d get points for a post- ] modern approach to coming on to

<p><strong>wichita</strong>: Goodnight, Jasper.</p>

depression, Wendy leads a single-file centipede ] of her robed campers
away from the showers. Wichita, head ] down as well, leads a line of his
campers<u>toward</u> the showers. ] ] OBERON NARRATION ] Being over
eighteen, the counselors ] assumed all love is shit. It was ] the
campers who were most ] disillusioned by the fall of Wichita ] and
Wendy. ] ] The two human trains are about to collide when Wendy and ]
Wichita look up. Without verbal acknowledgement, they glumly ] readjust
and continue their head-down trek. The boys and ] girls look from Wendy
to Wichita in despair. ]</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Hey campers, give me a morning YEE- HO!</p>
<p><strong>the campers</strong>: Yee-Ho.</p>
<p><strong>oberon narration</strong>: At even the best camps, the fear
and excitement of the opening weeks gives way to dull routine, but after
finding and losing the thrill of romance, the organism that was Camp
Bleeding Squaw seem to wither and die faster than usual.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Hey campers, how about a morning YEE-HO!</p>
<p><strong>campers</strong>: Yee….Ho.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Hey campers, I think it’s time for a morning
YEE-HO!</p>
<p><strong>campers</strong>: yeeho.</p>
<p><strong>int. arts and crafts room–day ]</strong>: ] Another line of
campers solemnly sit with their bored look- ] a-like parents in the Arts
and Crafts room. The campers ] dutifully hold up some piece of crap they
made. The parents ] weakly smile as it falls apart. ] ] OBERON NARRATION
] All this ennui culminated into the ] deadly-dull, Day 20, halfway-mark
] non-event known as Parents Day. ]</p>
<p><strong>ext. patch of the forest–night ]</strong>: ] Oberon goes
through a pile of tiny, brightly colored ] notebooks on his lap. ] ]

session. Good stuff! ] ] BOYS VOICE FROM DIARY ] I can’t believe those
are the people ] I was homesick for…I’m really going ] to savor my
remaining days here at ] camp and only do exciting stuff like ] the plan
to get Wichita and Wendy ] back together. Tonight’s secret ] camper
meeting about the Day 21 ] mission went really good, I mean, ] well. ] ]
GIRLS VOICE FROM DIARY ] It was just so neat to see them ] flirting and
pretending to be arguing ] with each other. It was like watching ]
<u>Titanic</u> without the boat. That’s ] why I’m so happy everything’s
going ] to come together on Day 21… ] ] Oberon smiles, then looks to his
watch. He kicks out the ] fire and heads off. ]</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: That was a bummer, Stanley–your parents not
coming to parents day– you all right?</p>
<p><strong>eric friend stanley</strong>: Yeah, I’m fine. My Mom had to
work. I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>wichita</strong>: That really sucked, Eric, what you did,
asking him that…</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Oh thanks, it was nothing…</p>
<p><strong>wichita</strong>: You know, I think I left something by the
lake. Could you check it out– You’ll know it when you see it…</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Sure, Wichita. Whatever you say…</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Isn’t Fun great? It’s the first day of last
half of camp, so let’s start with the biggest YEE-HO yet. YEE- HO!</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Boy oh boy and girl oh girl, looks like I’m
going to have to tug out my super-secret summer weapon! I think I have
two words that will turn some of those frowns upside down.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: Please God, don’t let one of those words be
“Scavenger.”</p>
<p><strong>talia ]</strong>: No way, she can’t be that fucking ]
desperate. ]</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: “Scavenger Hunt!” Is it getting awesome in
here or is it just me! Counselors, pass out the lists!</p>
<p><strong>talia ]</strong>: No, no, I can’t. ] ] DONALD ] You have to.
I called it. ] ] Laughing, Talia gives in to the high-five. ] ] ADAM ] ]
gruffly passes out the golden scavenger sheets to the ] underwhelmed
campers. He grumbles to the flyers. ] ] ADAM ] This fun and games shit
is getting ] old. ] ] ADAM CAMPER ] What did you say, Adam? ] ] ADAM ] I
said red team is going to kick ] ass on the scavenger hunt. ] ] Adam
passes out some more flyers, including one to Bedwetter ] Ted. Adam
pauses. ] ] ADAM ] Ted, dry for a week. I’m proud of ] you. ] ] The
counselor and camper trade thumb-up signs. Adam continues ] on, flipping
forth scavenger lists to Wichita and Jasper, ] who drowsily scowl at
them. ] ] JASPER ] Wichita, this is one girl who needs ] a good
virginity loss…Uh, what’s ] with Eric? ] ] Eric sits at the end of the
table with the same dazed ] expression he had while watching Pixel. ] ]
WICHITA ] Eric’s been a good boy, so I thought ] I’d initiate him into
the world of… ] ] Wichita cuts off. Squinting down, he pokes his finger
into ] his cereal bowl and pinches out a plastic baggie that has ] been
submerged in the milk. In the bag is a note which ] Wichita swiftly
skims. His eyes widen and he bolts up. ] ] AT WENDY’S TABLE ] ] The
African-American Super-counselor bends to Wendy, who ] speaks while she
eats. ] ] WENDY ] And don’t forget to make sure the ] campers all have
sacks to put their ] retrieved objects in. Oh, and before ] I
forget…What’s he doing? ] ] Wendy cuts off to watch Wichita rush past
and pound through ] the cafeteria doors. She brings a spoonful of
cereal, with ] a baggied note balanced atop, to her unsuspecting lips.
]</p>
<p><strong>wichita ]</strong>: I got this note…It was in my bowl… ] ]
WENDY ] Yeah. Me, too. ]</p>
<p><strong>ext. outside wendy and pixel’s cabin–day ]</strong>: ] A
co-ed mixture of campers are huddled at the edge of the ] woods, taking
turns staring through binoculars. ] ] ERIC ] My note said I’m a
pyromaniac who ] wants to burn down cabin 2… ] ] MISCHIEVOUS GIRL TWO ]
Oh that’s much better than ours. ] We went with this lame suicide ]
attempt-type thing… ] ] RYAN, THE GOLDEN BOY ] What are they saying? Let
the boys ] have a turn… ] ] CAMPER GIRL WITH BINOCULARS ] It’s looking
good, it’s looking ] good… ]</p>
<p><strong>back in the cabin ]</strong>: ] Wichita and Wendy
uncomfortably lean toward each other, ] comparing notes. ] ] WENDY ] I
mean, what a ridiculous way to ] try and get us together alone… ] ]
WICHITA ] ] Yeah, no way could it work… ] ] WENDY ] This is absurd…I’m
sorry if we’re ] not going to become the cute camp ] couple
that-everybody wants us to ] be…I don’t want to talk about this. ] I
think it’s important we stay ] focused on the camp. ] ] WICHITA ]
Absolutely. Day after Parent’s Day ] is important. The campers need to ]
feel they’re not going back to the ] usual grind. They need to be ]
challenged… ] ] WENDY ] I know. That’s why I scheduled the ] Scavenger
Hunt. ] ] WICHITA ] Your lack of irony is brutal. ] ] WENDY ] ] Fuck
you. ] ] WICHITA ] Wow…was that your first time saying ] that word… ] ]
WENDY ] Fuck you! ] ] WICHITA ] Improving. Let’s try it once more… ]</p>
<p><strong>ext. outside the cabin–day ]</strong>: ] Through binoculars,
Wendy can be seen violently mouthing ] the bad word. The Binocular
Camper Girl lowers them. ] ] CAMPER GIRL ] It’s looking bad, it’s
looking bad… ]</p>
<p><strong>wendy ]</strong>: 8, 9, 10…I apologize for my ] outburst.
We’ve both been under ] stress. I know you’re not religious, ] but ever
since Oberon…What are ] you doing? Don’t, please don’t… ]</p>
<p><strong>wichita</strong>: When were you in Niagara Falls?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: About ten years a–why…Don’t look at
these…Come on…Stop.</p>
<p><strong>wichita ]</strong>: Niagara Falls is where my Mom first ]
told us…Wait, how much younger ] than me are– ]</p>
<p><strong>wendy ]</strong>: Now that we’re past all the personal ]
nonsense, let’s speak counselor to ] counselor: I’m running the camp now
] and I expect your obedience and ] your… ] ] WICHITA ] Yeah. Whatever
you say. ] ] Wichita races out of the cabin, leaving Wendy very
perplexed. ]</p>
<p><strong>ext. outside the cabin–day ]</strong>: ] The spying campers
sadly watch Wichita bolt from the cabin. ]</p>
<p><strong>ext. the woods–day ]</strong>: ] Decked out for a hike, Wendy
leads Counselors and Campers ] into a single-file-Heigh-Ho trot across
the familiar tree ] balance-beamed over the small ravine, clutching
scavenger ] sheets and wearing little bags. ] ] OBERON NARRATION ] The
adventure was about to begin ] and I don’t mean the Scavenger ] Hunt…
]</p>
<p><strong>talia ]</strong>: ] leans against a tree, off to the side,
shaking her head to ] the image while crumpling a Scavenger list sheet.
] ] OBERON NARRATION ] Everyone was hungry for a change, ] but no one
more than Talia, even ] if Change meant being eaten by a ] family of
bears. She had become ] a camp counselor for reasons other ] than camp
or counseling with harsh ] results. On Day 21, she was pretty ] much
resigned to 19 more days of ] torture…until she opened her eyes. ] ]
Talia re-focuses back to the log–Subversively tomboyesque ] Hayley is
making her cross when her friend Vanessa calls ] out from a planted
position at the end of the makeshift ] bridge. The Bombshellettes can be
seen waiting in the fuzzy ] distance. ] ] VANESSA ] Hayley… ] ] HAYLEY ]
Where were you, Vanessa? You’re not ] wearing that on the… ] ] VANESSA ]
I’m blowing off the Hunt. Quelle ] snore. Tiffany and Brooke got ]
permissh from Wendy to lay out on ] the megaraft and read magazines as ]
long as we keep it tied to the pier. ] ] HAYLEY ] Wow. Sounds raging.
You’re saying ] you’d rather– ] ] ONE OF THE BOMBSHELLETTES ] Come on,
Vanessa. ] ] VANESSA ] Yeah, I’d rather. ] ] Vanessa turns to her new
pals, stranding Hayley on the ] collapsed tree. Affected by the poignant
image, Talia removes ] her sunglasses, no longer selfishly frazzled.
]</p>
<p><strong>further along in the woods ]</strong>: ] The Kids are spread
out over the woods, looking downward ] like a search party tracking down
a corpse. A RED-TEAM CAMPER ] rushes up to a staring-ahead Adam, holding
up a robin’s egg. ] ] RED TEAM CAMPER ] Robin’s egg, sir. Three points
for ] the red team. ] ] ADAM ] Yeah. Outstanding. Three points. ] ]
OBERON NARRATION ] Even Adam was losing intensity. It ] was hard to stay
pumped over the ] increasingly benign skirmishes of ] the almighty Color
War, especially ] with so many dazzling distractions… ]</p>
<p><strong>oberon narration (v.o.) ]</strong>: As much as Pixel was
nauseated by ] Adam, she was intrigued. The Wendy ] project was not
quite going the way ] she wanted…and a vibrator would ] keep the kids
awake at night and ] besides, there was only one ] electrical outlet in
the cabin to ] begin with so… ] ] Pixel spins around causing the
tailgating Adam to brake. ] ] PIXEL ] Could you please take your
periscope ] out of my ass… ]</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Uh, we got off to a bad start, me and you.
I’ll bet there’s a lot of things you don’t know about me.</p>
<p><strong>pixel</strong>: Believe me, I wish I knew less. Oh, if you
weren’t such a pig…</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I can be a good pig. Babe. Charlotte’s Web.
Good pig. Watch.</p>
<p><strong>adam ]</strong>: Hey Stanley, it must’ve been tough ] when
your parents didn’t… ] ] STANLEY ] I’m fine! Jesus! Will everyone please
] stop feeling sorry for me! ] ] Pixel brushes beside the shot-dawn
Adam. ] ] PIXEL ] Going to have to do better than ] that… ]</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Guess what, guys? I didn’t want to come out
and say anything the other day, but you know, I’ve had sex with my
mother, too…</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: He fell for it! What a perverted idiot!</p>
<p><strong>jasper ]</strong>: Your turn, Wichita… ] ] DONALD ] You’re
not going after him? ] ] WICHITA ] Todd’ll have a lot better time ]
daydreaming in the cabin about ] heroically saving the camp from a ]
fire than he will out here…So ] what’s with you and Talia cracking each
other up in the cafeteria. You two could be interesting together….</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: Oh, I don’t know…I can’t imagine….</p>
<p><strong>wichita</strong>: Start imagining. Watch me, you have to
Novocain your body like this…And your shirt–In or out, man?</p>
<p><strong>wichita</strong>: Make it seem you have this comfortable,
mysterious life and you don’t give a shit whether she’s a part of it.
Oh, and bring up India, Talia has this obsession… Whoa, Donald, play
hard to get, not hard to want…Let Talia know that your goofy act is just
something you do for the kids….</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: It is? I don’t know about this, Wichita. Am
I even right for Talia? ] What About Wendy? I mean, you and ] Wendy–how
are you and Wendy… ] ] WICHITA ] Complicated. Extremely. ] ] Wichita and
Donald drift closer toward the head-setted Wendy, ] who stands to the

Could you possibly ] do one thing and help keep the ] campers away
from…. ] ] WICHITA ] ] Hey everybody, we’re climbing the ] mountain!
]</p>
<p><strong>ext. the small mountain–day ]</strong>: ] Satisfied and
exhilarated, the entire camp is clawing and ] panting up the
undangerously inclined rockage of the camp’s ] mini-mountain. A frazzled
Wendy brings up the rear, clumping ] up discarded scavenger sheets and
bags. ]</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Don’t get angry, count to ten, count to..one,
two, three–Will you people please stop dropping your scavenger sheets
and retrieval sacks!</p>
<p><strong>hayley</strong>: Man, she’s losing it…</p>
<p><strong>talia</strong>: It’s about time. Isn’t Fun great?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Okay, okay, this sure was exciting, but it’s
time to go back…time to…What do we all say to a Marco Polo
tournament!</p>
<p><strong>climbing boy camper ]</strong>: That’s a baby game! ] ]
CLIMBING GIRL CAMPER ] Yeah! Besides, climbing the mountain ] sucks! ] ]
Wendy stomps to the head of the pack and a beaming Wichita. ] ] WENDY ]
Well, a positive “suck” usage. You ] must be so proud. Okay, I suppose ]
I deserve to be poked fun of a little ] bit, but…but climbing the

why we’re doing it. I really hope ] to see you at the top. ] ] Keep up

<p><strong>wendy</strong>: One, two, three–whore!</p>
<p><strong>white camper boy ]</strong>: Wendy, Billy just called me a

to… ] ] WHITE CAMPER BOY ] Whoa. ] ] PIXEL ] What was that, Wendy? ] ]
The white camper boy scampers off. ] ] WENDY Come back, I didn’t mean
to… ] Don’t look at me like that. Counseling tips from you of all

<p><strong>pixel</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: “And?” There’s no “And!”</p>
<p><strong>pixel ]</strong>: ] Oh, calm down…you dirty racist. ] ] WENDY
] I’m not… ] ] The Female African-American SuperCounselor rises up from

Wendy. Is it true you said… ] ] WENDY ] I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to say
the ] nigger-word–the N-word! Damnit! It’s ] the altitude, I’m not a
dirty racist! ] ] AFRICAN-AMERICAN SUPER-COUNSELOR ] ] Wendy, maybe you
should go back and ] lie down… ] ] WENDY ] I’m fine. I’m fine. I’m fine.

thought, ] Jeremy. I personally think Heaven… ] ] SECULAR CAMPER-GIRL ]
My parents have never even taken ] me to Church. They say religion is ]
a farce, which means it’s silly and ] wrong. ] ] WENDY ] Okay, so you’ve
never gone to Church, ] but Tammy, haven’t you noticed a ] pattern of
spiritual connections ] and coincidences that lead your life ] one way
as opposed to another? ] ] The Non-Religious Girl trembles with a “What
are you talking ] about” look of terror on her face. She begins to cry.
Wichita ] appears beside Wendy. ] ] WICHITA ] Oh, now look what you’ve
gone and ] done, you’ve insinuated the existence ] of a higher power and
caused the ] poor child to question everything ] she is… ] ] Sneering,
Wendy turns up the volume all the way on the ] headset and starts to
shout… ] ] WENDY ] That’s it! I demand… ] ] The headset dies with a
brain-piercing whine. ]</p>
<p><strong>ext. up ahead on the side of the hill–day ]</strong>: ] The
camp is splayed on the side of the hill, basking in a ] warranted rest
break. A constellation of seated-on-the-rock female counselors and
campers are getting vigorous back massages from the Wichita’s boys.
Stanley shiatsus a comically shellshocked Wendy.</p>
<p><strong>stanley ]</strong>: Wow, what a knot–Wendy, you are ] really

Unforgettable ] Summer Love” ] ] WENDY ] Oh yes…I need this. ] ] The
painfully familiar ballad blares on. Wendy relaxes in ] a reverie.
Everyone else groans. The nearby counselors and ] campers begin singing
along with the song in intentionally ] silly off-key fashion. Talia and
Hayley are especially ] obnoxious. Wendy seethes. ]</p>
<p><strong>below the masseurs ]</strong>: ] Jasper and his young pals,

<p><strong>donald</strong>: All in all, I’d rather be in India. I find
their culture to be so…</p>

you, Retarded Marshmallow Head? And you’ve been coached by the best. I
mean, of course, let’s pair off the two geeks! How convenient for
everyone. Talia can’t possibly have any standards! All of you can go to

<p><strong>hayley</strong>: Talia, don’t go!</p>
<p><strong>talia</strong>: Wha-at? What is it?</p>
<p><strong>hayley</strong>: Everything.</p>

<p><strong>oberon narration</strong>: Much like a little boy who throws
sand at the girl in the sandbox because he likes her, Wichita had helped
turn the mountain into a rumbling volcano that had almost given Wendy a
nervous breakdown. A good time was had, but it was now time to move on.
To start to take responsibility. To deal with the implications of the
photograph on Wendy’s wall…</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: You know I think I forgot to remember that
I’m allergic to bee stings.</p>
<p><strong>talia</strong>: Whew, that wasn’t a period. That was an
exclamation mark. You know, Hayley, behind every great woman is a great
first menstruation anecdote.</p>
<p><strong>hayley</strong>: I hope so…</p>
<p><strong>talia</strong>: This is…this is…a very special moment…</p>
<p><strong>ext. outside the infirmary–dusk ]</strong>: ] Wichita and

acknowledge one another. ] ] WICHITA ] How is she? ] ] TALIA ] She’s
okay. What about yours? ] ] WICHITA ] Like you care… ] ] TALIA ] Oh,
that’s right, Wichita, you like ] her more than you like me so I want ]
her to die. Oh, but hey, thanks for ] passing Donald my way. I need the

] TALIA ] ] Ass-hole. ]</p>
<p><strong>int. small general store–dusk ]</strong>: ] A wet Donald
mopes across the small store wiping the last ] of the frog’s blood off
his face. He brings up a basket of ] sundries to the counter where a
KINDLY OLD GROCER starts ] ringing him up. ] ] KINDLY OLD GROCER ]
Hello, Donald. How are things going ] up there? Those brats still giving
] you a hard time? ] ] DONALD ] You know it. ] ] KINDLY OLD GROCER ]
What about condoms? We got some of ] those “made for her pleasure” ones
] that you requested. ] ] Donald goes into “cool” mode as the kindly
Grocer piles boxes ] of condoms on the counter. ] ] DONALD ] Thank you,
Walter. Double my usual ] supply. You know, the babes are ] starting to
realize camp is half- ] over…I don’t have to explain the ] effect. ] ]
KINDLY OLD GROCER ] You most certainly do not. When I ] think about all
the times you’ve come ] in here…You must be the Errol Flynn ] of camp. ]
] DONALD ] That’s funny, that’s what all the ] kids call me. ] ] KINDLY
OLD GROCER ] Have a good one. ] ] DONALD ] Always do. ] ] Turning from
the counter, Donald’s cool aches back to defeat. ] ] OBERON NARRATION ]
Pathetic. I just thought you should ] know now that nobody ends up ]
responding to Donald’s inner beauty. ] He does not get the girl, or even
] a girl…But he does get the last ] laugh. Just not for a while. ]</p>

cabin, leading out his charges. ] ] WICHITA ] Okay, everybody from my
cabin, let’s ] go…Wendy is going to be fine…And ] if anyone shows any
kind of ] disrespect to Hayley, they’ll be ] the ones bleeding. ] ]
Soaked to the bone, Donald moroses through the door, straight ] into his
quarters, clutching a sack. Wichita takes notice. ]</p>
<p><strong>wichita</strong>: Howdy Pouty.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: I was pretty confident that I was going to
blow it with Talia, but I must say, I outdid myself.</p>
<p><strong>wichita</strong>: She’s still pissed at me and took it out on
you. We should have taken it slower. It’s hard to operate in the woods.
Much easier in, like a club. Tell the girl you’ve got to go do
something, leave her view, take way too long until she is worried that
you’re not coming back. Just as she starts feeling awful, you come up
from behind and touch her neck…</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: You are the prince of the darkness.</p>
<p><strong>wichita ]</strong>: Yeah. I should put all my shit in ] a
book and then throw away the ] book… ]</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: The funny thing about this Talia thing is I
wasn’t even really that…The person I really like– I probably shouldn’t
be admitting this…</p>
<p><strong>wichita</strong>: I’m in the picture on Wendy’s wall. Niagara
Falls. Family trip. Little Wendy foreground. Me background. What are the
odds on that one?</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: Uh, yeah, that’s…wow.</p>
<p><strong>wichita</strong>: I couldn’t tell her…it’s, it’s too
major…Jesus, I’m starting to believe in God and what’s worse I think I
like the guy. The lightning bolt was just a test, right? Wendy and
I–we’re meant to be. I’m right, right? I have to see her…</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: Say Hi for me.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: What is it, Cosmo?</p>
<p><strong>cosmo, the donaldish camper</strong>: I don’t know…this
girl…gave me this note…she wants to meet by the creek tonight…I don’t
know.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: Camp Eberhardt. Anne Wilson, lovely Anne
Wilson. She was the only camper to have a lifeguard’s license so she was
the only one allowed to take out a canoe without supervision. She asked
me to come with her for a post-bonfire spin around the lake and I said
no. I was young, I was nervous, I didn’t really like canoes– I said no.
If I would have gone on that canoe, I’d be a different person, I know
it. Successful, happy, assertive. I’d be a nearsighted Wichita. You
think you’re a kid so your decisions don’t matter now. They do. They all
do.</p>
<p><strong>cosmo, the donaldish camper</strong>: Okay, okay, I’ll go to
the dumb lake. But only if you do “Retard goes to ] the Movies.” ] ] The
other campers, joyfully rabid, encircle Donald. ] ] CLAMORING KID ]
Yeah, Retarded Marshmallow Head, ] Do the retard! ] ] DONALD ] It’s not
very nice to make fun of ] the mentally handicapped… ] ] COSMO ] Yeah,
but it makes us laugh… ] ] Donald immediately contorts himself into a
Carreyesque/Sling ] Blade slouch and lurches about the cabin to camper
guffaws. ] ] DONALD ] I lack to gowuh to duh movies becuz ] my Uncle
Playdohhead buys me duh ] Dunior mints if I do duh Dunior mint ] dance!

<p><strong>ext. outside of the infirmary–night ]</strong>: ] Wichita
clandestinely streams the side of a small building ] where the now
completely composed Epileptic Girl stands ] waiting. He hands over an
entire box of gum. ] ] EPILEPTIC GIRL ] Trident Cinnamon? ] ] WICHITA ]
Yes, ma’am. Great work today, Tracy. ] I’ll probably need you again on ]
Thursday. ] ] TRACY, THE EPILEPTIC GIRL ] You’re going to see her,
aren’t you? ] ] WICHITA ] Romantic, huh? ] ] Wichita hand-smacks Tracy
goodbye. He then whizzes around ] a building corner, almost whistling
with the excitement. ] He sees Todd blobbed before the infirmary door.
Wichita ] immediately cringes back around the building. ]</p>
<p><strong>up close with todd ]</strong>: ] Todd stares down at his
feet, waiting for camp to end. ] Wichita takes a kamikaze sitting
position beside him. ] ] WICHITA ] ] Hello, Todd. What are you doing ]
outside the infirmary? ] ] TODD ] What do you care? You don’t like me ]
as much as everyone else doesn’t ] like me. That Mexican boy Lionel ] is
fatter than me and he has friends. ] I should sue this camp for Lack of
] Fun. Oh, Diarrhea. ] ] WICHITA ] Whuh? ] ] TODD ] You asked me why I
was here, didn’t ] you? Geez! ] ] WICHITA ] Oh. You know, Todd, no one
cares ] whether you live or die. Don’t get ] me wrong, it’s the same for
] everybody. Now it’s a sad thing that ] nobody cares if you die–but
then ] if you’re dead, who cares that nobody ] cares. Now the nobody
cares if you ] live part is great. It means you ] can come up with any
idea and quietly ] burrow it into the world. You may ] fail a few times
and other people ] might say negative things, but other ] people are
basically lame and they ] never put up much of a fight. ] ] TODD ] Uh,
is that speech in the camp ] workbooklet..? ] ] WICHITA ] Todd, you
gotta stop taking ] everything so seriously. You have ] to have a sense
of humor about life. ] ] TODD ] But what if it’s not funny. ] ] Wichita
gulps at Todd’s persistent humanity. He starts to ] pat Todd on the
back, but wisely freezes. ] ] WICHITA ] Want some gum? ]</p>
<p><strong>wichita ]</strong>: You were magnificent today. Camp ] Hall
of Fame. ] ] WENDY ] Would have been cooler if I had died. ]</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: I have to get up. Still more to do. That boy
hates Asian people. That girl thinks she gave her Mom cancer by dropping
a plate on her hand. Her daddy touches her. His daddy never touches him.
It would have been cooler if I’d died.</p>
<p><strong>wichita ]</strong>: Wendy, I’ll come back later. ] ] WENDY ]
Why does every ten year old know ] what they want to be when they grow ]
up, but then as you actually grow ] up, you forget every–The girls are ]
big on “Veterinarian” this year– ] I think it could be the “ballerina” ]
of this century. ]</p>
<p><strong>wichita</strong>: You’re seriously wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Hey…You have to get out of here. I’m…having a
bad face day. Don’t look at me… ] Jasper told me what you did. Carrying
] me down the mountain as fast as you ] could… ] ] WICHITA ] Only
dropped you twice… ]</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Isn’t this the time where one of us says
something deeply offensive to the other one…We’re just so different.</p>
<p><strong>wichita ]</strong>: So what? ]</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Yeah, why should we let our actual
personalities get in the way of us falling in love?</p>
<p><strong>wichita</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>wichita</strong>: Todd was out there blocking the ] entrance.
You would have been proud ] of me…My suit of armor is starting to come
off. Not all of it, but enough to walk around…</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: And you’ll be happy to know I’m going to drop
my Snow White and the Seventy Dwarves act…Not all of it, but…</p>
<p><strong>wichita</strong>: I was thinking…if we could mesh my way of
thinking with your way ] of thinking, we could really do some ] great
counseling. It’s all about ] the evolution of the species, we ] can
improve… ]</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: I love you. Don’t say I love you, too. I hate
that–“love you, too.”</p>
<p><strong>wichita</strong>: I know what you mean. But it doesn’t put me
in too great a position…</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Don’t worry, you…</p>
<p><strong>wichita</strong>: God, you’re beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>wendy ]</strong>: Thank you, my love. ]</p>

Adam, grin ] as well. ]</p>
<p><strong>ext. the forest–day ]</strong>: ] Like Dali watches, campers
are strategically splayed about ] a forest clearing. A deer delicately
clumps around them. ] The campers simultaneously rise up out of their
stupor. ] ] OBERON NARRATION ] Soon the rest of the camp let go ] and
went with the utopian flow. ]</p>
<p><strong>ext. the lake–day ]</strong>: ] The lake is placid and
untouched. Suddenly, the entire camp, ] counselors and campers,
boisterously plow into the frame ] and into the water with their clothes
on to splash and shout ] in giddy release. ]</p>
<p><strong>oberon narration (v.o.) ]</strong>: Every camp, in its
closing weeks, ] must cut loose from the regimentation ] of its early
stages. Every camp ] has to find a way to reinvent itself ] in a more
casual, free-er ] form….Bleeding Squaw just went ] a bit further. I
can’t take all the ] credit–there was a much deeper cause ] of our
anarchy than my cut-the-camp- ] off-from-civilization mischief… ]</p>
<p><strong>a sudden flash ]</strong>: ] of skin on skin. Indecipherable
body parts. Lip biting close- ] ups. Operatic music on the soundtrack.
]</p>
<p><strong>oberon narration</strong>: Sex, of course. Don’t worry, only
four people were actually having it. But…</p>
<p><strong>oberon narration</strong>: the whole idea of it, the scent of
it, seemed to insinuate itself into everything like a lush fog…and a
grotesque oil spill.</p>
<p><strong>ext. the center of camp–dusk ]</strong>: ] On the center of
camp’s grass, resembling a 60’s love-in, ] every male camper gives a
massage to every female camper. ]</p>
<p><strong>wichita</strong>: Excuse me, Counselor Wendy, I need
assistance in finding that important…thingie in the storage room.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Oh my gosh, why didn’t you say something
earlier…</p>
<p><strong>oberon narration</strong>: As always, everything revolved
around Wendy and Wichita. They were the plant on the classroom
windowsill, fed and watered by enthusiastic teachers and children.</p>
<p><strong>oberon narration</strong>: It’s so much fun to watch it grow
and grow…but these classroom plants always have a way of getting too
big…beyond control…</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Do you really think we’re fooling anyone?</p>
<p><strong>wichita</strong>: Do you really think I care?</p>
<p><strong>wendy ]</strong>: You’re bad… ] ] WICHITA ] We’re bad… ]</p>
<p><strong>wichita</strong>: She got a little poison oak and started
screaming for assisted suicide.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Be nice. Her father died in that TWA flight
the government shot down…You know I’m going to be in the city next week.
My mom says it’s okay that I stay overnight at your dorm…It’ll be nice
to see you in ] a different shirt. ] ] WICHITA ] Oh, I didn’t tell you.
I wear this ] all year round. The chicks dig it… ]</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: It’s going to be strange. Having to plan
“dates” and…. Something wrong? What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>wichita ]</strong>: ] What’s not up. Guess my mind is on ]
the end of camp and all that. ] ] WENDY ] It’s okay…Serves us right
after ] these last weeks… ] ] WICHITA ] ] Yeah. Serves us right. ]</p>
<p><strong>ext. forest campfire–night ]</strong>: ] Oberon, beard larger
than ever, is familiarly sifting through ] Wichita and Wendy’s
respective Journals. The pages are barren ] of new writing. He
eventually clings up some of the campers’ ] journals as well. Blank as
well. ] ] OBERON NARRATION ] So much was happening, so quickly, ] no
time to process it for both ] witnesses and participants. The ]
journals, so often packed with ] scribbled spiritual groping, were ] now
completely blank. Constant ] activity, be it archery or fucking, ]
without introspection is dangerous. ] It causes a brain clot, even worse
] a clotting of the soul. Bleeding ] Squaw had gone Koyaanisquatsi…out-
] of-balance, but then, if you’ve ever been to a summer camp, you know
how matters most astonishing, tragic, and wondrous are not worked out
until the very last day.</p>
<p><strong>int. the mess hall–day ]</strong>: ] The MESS HALL is a mess.
Loud and dirty with a black eye ] or two, the campers race around from
table to table in ] rhythmic chaos. Boys and girls eat together–some of
them ] on the floor. The counselors are too ethereally de-energized ] to
do anything actively disciplinary. ]</p>
<p><strong>oberon narration</strong>: Oh, I almost forgot about Talia.
She did the most shocking thing of all: She became a camp counselor.</p>
<p><strong>talia ]</strong>: I finished your poem, Hayley. It ] rocked
and I’m not just saying that. ] ] HAYLEY ] But I’ll never be as good a
writer as you… ] ] TALIA ] ] Good point. Sit down, I want to ] show…
]</p>
<p><strong>at a table with wendy and donald ]</strong>: ] A healthier
Donald, his face seemingly acne-less, has risen ] to present Wendy with
a gorgeously ornate miniature of the ] camp with a micro-Wendy in the
middle. ] ] DONALD ] and there’s you in the middle.. ] ] WENDY ] Oh
Donald, it’s so…so exquisite. ] You must have put so much work into ]
it…You know, Donald, your face ] is really clearing up… ] ] DONALD ] Oh,
uh, thanks…I just want to say ] that knowing you has… ] ] Wendy looks
off to see Wichita set up a chair at the front ] of the cafeteria. ] ]
WENDY ] Donald, I have to go check on ] something, but thanks… ] ]
DONALD ] ] Another run to the storage room? ] ] WENDY ] ] No–Well–It’s
not–I–Anyway, thanks ] for the, the object… ] ] As Wendy sheepishly
departs, Donald removes his hand from ] a contemplative position on his
face, revealing a comically ] concentrated patch of acne. A Frisbee
swooshes into Donald’s ] Arts and Crafts masterpiece and clips off the
flagpole. ] ] DONALD’S GOONY CAMPERS ] Sorry, Marsh-head! ]</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Excuse me, Wichita, I can’t seem to reach the
top shelf in the storage room. Could you…</p>
<p><strong>wichita</strong>: Not now, Wendy.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: This isn’t about “doing it.” I just think we
need to talk some things out privately before…</p>
<p><strong>wichita</strong>: Does this camp suck or does this camp
suck?</p>
<p><strong>the campers</strong>: This camp sucks!</p>
<p><strong>wichita</strong>: They tried to tame us…They forced us to
make their bead necklaces and run their sack races, but we rebelled! We
made our own camp!</p>
<p><strong>ryan, the ex-healthy kid ]</strong>: Eric, man, you gotta
hook me up. ] Ho-ho’s, ding dongs, some Little ] Debbie action. My
parents won’t send ] me the shit. You hear what I’m ] saying, they’re
sending me <u>pears</u>, ] for chrissakes… ] ] ERIC ] Back off–I warned
you about too ] much, too fast. Now get out of my ] face… ]</p>
<p><strong>wichita ]</strong>: And don’t leave this attitude in ] your
sleeping bag. Take it with you ] back to so-called society–to your ]
parents, your teachers, to anybody ] who tries to give you shit! ] ]
Pixel crouches beside Wendy. ] ] PIXEL ] Uh, what’s with loverboy? ] ]
WENDY ] Pixel…he’s been strange these last ] couple of days. I feel him
pulling ] back…Maybe it’s my imagination– ] I know he loves me–It’s
just– ] ] PIXEL ] Quiet…a plan is forming. Come on. ] ] Pixel tugs Wendy
away. Wendy makes momentary eye-contact ] with Wichita, who turns and
roars to a finish. ] ] WICHITA ] There’s only one activity you need ] to
do before tonight’s big dance! ] Anything you want! ] ] OLDER ADAM CABIN
CAMPER ] But that’s what we’ve doing for the ] past week… ] ] WICHITA ]
Geez, give you little bastards your ] freedom and this is how you repay
] me? Okay, let’s all hit the beach; ] I’ll figure out something
relatively ] mind-blowing when we get there. ] “Move it!” ] ] The camp
bustles upward. ]</p>
<p><strong>wichita ]</strong>: How’d it go? You didn’t tell her you ]
were… ] ] JASPER ] Oh, that’s not very inventive. ] ] “You’re obviously
a very desirable ] young woman, but Dorothy, if I took ] advantage of
you at this point in ] your life…dot-dot-dot.” ]</p>
<p><strong>wichita</strong>: You’re good. Oh God, look at Jerry Rice
over there.</p>
<p><strong>jasper</strong>: You’re a little harsh on Todd. You’re a
little harsh on everybody. I know ] you like to think of yourself as ]
the Anti-Oberon, but man, you’re ] getting just as spooky. What was ]
that speech in there? Does Camp really ] have to be a revolutionary act?
Can’t ] the children, at their own pace, ] discover… ] ] WICHITA ] Yeah,
okay, I was a little out of ] hand, but come on, you got to give me
Todd. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve learned to love the little Piggy, but
Todd is the most invincible loser I’ve ever come across. His greatest
talent is lack thereof. No matter ] what the category, bet against him ]
and win. ]</p>
<p><strong>jasper</strong>: Stop, stop…I’m willing to put my mouth where
my mouth is…I throw one overhand pass and Todd catches it– dramatic
pause–You let me go down on you…</p>
<p><strong>wichita</strong>: Hello?! What’s in it for me?</p>
<p><strong>jasper</strong>: Thanks a lot. Seriously though, by winning
this bet, you will prove to the world that you indeed know everything.
Isn’t the rush of gambling on your cynical philosophy of life
enough?</p>
<p><strong>wichita ]</strong>: ] Yes. It is. But let’s throw in you ]
having to write the camper ] evaluations for the entire cabin. ] ]
JASPER ] Shit…Deal. ]</p>
<p><strong>wichita</strong>: Sorry Jasper, this handshake is as hot as
it’s going to get.</p>
<p><strong>jasper</strong>: Go back for a pass, Todd. I know you can
catch it, buddy.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Sure, Jasper.</p>
<p><strong>wichita</strong>: Todd. Don’t drop it.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Ooh–Almost!</p>
<p><strong>jasper</strong>: Yeah, “almost,” you fat fuck.</p>
<p><strong>jasper ]</strong>: Oh hi, Charlie. Excellent Eggs ] Benedict
this morning. ] ] COOK ] Thanks. I know I’m just the Camp ] Cook and I
know I’m not all ] smoldering like that Wichita. But, ] for what it’s
worth, I’m gay. ] ] JASPER ] Why did you wait until the last day ] of
camp to tell me? ] ] COOK ] I figured you wouldn’t be interested. ] ]
JASPER ] 40 days without–Let me see your ] teeth. ]</p>
<p><strong>pixel ]</strong>: Okay, let’s go through it again… ] ] WENDY
] This is so silly, Pixel. ]</p>
<p><strong>pixel</strong>: You want to know if Wichita’s love is true. I
can think of nothing less silly. I approach Wichita at the beach, tell
him he needs to go to the woods…</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: It’ll never work…</p>
<p><strong>pixel</strong>: You’ll be hiding behind a tree.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: The oak where Jocelyn sprained her ankle.</p>
<p><strong>pixel</strong>: Exactly. When we get into the clearing, I’ll
turn on my sexy moves. Wichita will go for it or he’ll shoot me down.
Either way, you come away with knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>wendy ]</strong>: ] Let’s do it up. ] ] To the sound of their
retreating footsteps, Wichita exhales ] a tickled chuckle. Strangely
though, his beaming face ] deteriorates into a rock-hard-serious
expression. ]</p>
<p><strong>ext. the beach–day ]</strong>: ] Sitting on the beach,
Wichita has maintained his eerie, ] stone faced expression as the camp
merrily gallivants around ] him. Pixel’s shadow envelopes him. ]</p>
<p><strong>pixel</strong>: Wichita–the Thomas Twins are missing.
Somebody said they saw them run into the forest. Can you help me?</p>
<p><strong>pixel</strong>: Hmmm…I wonder where those two rascals could
be…</p>
<p><strong>pixel</strong>: Now that were in the middle of nowhere,
aren’t you a little curious to know what it’d be like to…</p>
<p><strong>wendy ]</strong>: No! No…You…you…God damn you! ]</p>
<p><strong>ext. the beach–day ]</strong>: ] The counselors and campers
continue to cut an idyllic image ] on the beach, playing, splashing,
relaxing. ] ] The new, laid-back Adam lazily catches some rays, reading
] some gooey Women-are-from-Venus self-help book. Pixel ] scampers up in
a breathless delirium. ] ] ADAM ] Where have you been, babe? ] ] PIXEL ]
Watch this–the empire is ] crumbling… ] ] A weeping Wendy tears into the
Beach Party postcard, stopping ] at the water’s edge. Wichita storms up
behind her. Frisbees ] drop. Sandcastles collapse. The camp extinguishes
their ] beach blanket bingo to watch their model of romantic love ]
rupture. ] ] WICHITA ] Wendy–I’m sorry–Wend– ] ] WENDY ] How could
you–how could–I gave ] you ever-y-thing! I gave you parts ] of myself I
never even knew I had! ] ] WICHITA ] Wendy, I never meant to… ] ] Wendy
connects with a savage punch to Wichita’s stomach that ] leaves him and
the rest of the beach gasping. ]</p>
<p><strong>oberon ]</strong>: ] is revealed in the bushes at the back of
the beach, watching ] through binoculars. He swings his viewpoint from
the Wendy- ] Wichita fight to a small canoe… ]</p>
<p><strong>on the water ]</strong>: ] Unaware of the goings-on sandside,
Tracy, the epileptic girl, ] has her arms around Two Best Buddies,
belting out a silly ] song, while standing on a canoe. She starts to
vibrate into a seizure.</p>
<p><strong>the beach ]</strong>: ] Oberon lowers his binoculars and
howls. Wichita and Wendy ] truce their war to take notice of him. ] ]
WICHITA ] Big Chief Oberon has awakened. What ] is he… ] ] WENDY ] Oh
look, that girl you got on your ] payroll is doing her seizure act ]
again… ]</p>
<p><strong>on the water ]</strong>: ] Tracey falls. Her head bashes
against the side of the boat ] on the way down into the water. ]</p>
<p><strong>on the beach ]</strong>: ] Wichita instantly breaks from his
stupor and lightnings into ] the water. ] ] The rest of the counselors
charge onto the pier. Wichita ] aches Tracy the epileptic girl’s body up
out of the water. ]</p>
<p><strong>talia</strong>: Tracy, can you hear me? Okay good, that’s it,
that’s right, cough it out. We’re going to the infirmary, honey…</p>
<p><strong>wichita ]</strong>: ] is still in the water in his clothes,
utterly unnerved. He ] sinks below the surface. ]</p>
<p><strong>on the pier ]</strong>: ] The counselors watch Epileptic
Tracy being carried away into ] the forest. Wendy rumbles…then erupts. ]
] WENDY ] Can’t you see…We’ve been selfishly ] clawing for any thrill we
can get ] with a reckless, putrid disregard ] to safety and morality
and…and ] now we are being punished! Rightfully ] punished! ] ] PIXEL ]
Oh, please. Epileptic Girls should ] always wear life preservers. End ]
of story. Let’s dance. ]</p>
<p><strong>ext. the area before the boys cabins–night ]</strong>: ] The
area before the cabins has been done up with cheesy ] hanging lights. A
vicious rocker pounds from a crappy stereo ] system worked by Donald.
The Upper and Lower Income Latin ] Boys from the opening are doing an
intense lip-sync, sharing ] a mike before the wildly-badly dancing
crowd. ]</p>
<p><strong>outskirts of dance area ]</strong>: ] Talia and Hayley are
crashed on some cabin steps. They are ] silent and a little sad. ] ]
HAYLEY ] I wish you were my Mom. ] ] TALIA ] I think you mean to say:
attractive, ] glamorous, older sister… ] ] They softly, sweetly titter.
Fanning herself, a sweaty Pixel ] huffs up from the dance floor. ] ]
PIXEL Talia, get away from her, I told you, Hayley’s <u>my</u>

<p><strong>talia</strong>: Mine!</p>
<p><strong>hayley</strong>: You guys have been so colossal…</p>
<p><strong>pixel</strong>: Don’t forget, when you get home, O.B.’s.
They’re created by a female gynecologist.</p>
<p><strong>talia</strong>: Yeah, an insane female gynecologist! Hayley,
don’t listen to her.</p>
<p><strong>pixel</strong>: They’re the easiest to shoplift, okay? No
woman should have to pay for something forced-on-her-without- choice by
Nature…what’s the matter, Hayley? ] ] As they playfully bicker, Hayley
gazes, with a tinge of ] longing, to Vanessa and the Bombshellettes
parked at a picnic ] table, flirting up a storm with their
cute-boy-counterparts. ] ] TALIA ] What do you think–it’s the Last ]
Night of Camp Dance. ] ] PIXEL ] What are you saying? She doesn’t need ]
some <u>boy</u> to validate her summer ] experience! ] ] TALIA ] Oh of
course she does, you dumb ] bitch. Just because we’re feminist, ]
doesn’t mean we have to be totally ] abnormal. ] ] PIXEL ] Hayley back
me up… ] ] HAYLEY ] ] One dance would be kind of ] nice…Don’t hate me,
Pixel. ] ] PIXEL ] ] I don’t. Now go away, Talia and I ] need to huddle…
]</p>
<p><strong>dance area ]</strong>: ] Briefly lowering the musique, Donald
takes the microphone. ] ] DONALD ] You asked for it. You’re scared of ]
it. You got it–the last slow dance ] of the summer–in ten minutes. You ]
have been warned. Act accordingly. ] ] The campers stop and shudder as
if hit with an ] electromagnetic pulse. They gulp and move toward one
another ] as Donald cranks back up with a happy tune. ] ] Looking and
feeling unfestive, Wichita enters the arena. ] His eyes rove over the
Last Dance ambiance. The African- ] American SuperCounselor and her big
Stoner Lug beau stroll ] by, touchingly holding hands, with matching
paper mache ] roses. Adam sidles beside Wichita for contemplation. ] ]
ADAM ] Get a load of those two. Still in ] the kissy-hand holdy stage.
Pretty ] pathetic, huh? ] ] WICHITA ] ] Yeah…Have you seen Wendy? ]</p>
<p><strong>ext. the dance–night ]</strong>: ] The campers continue to
adorably-awkwardly couple up. Pixel ] and Talia look on like Wall Street
brokers. ] ] PIXEL ] You’re right, you’re right, that’s ] a good match.
Pam never speaks and ] Martin can’t shut up. Hurry, what ] about Hayley…
] ] TALIA ] I don’t know, I don’t know, Hayley ] seems to get along with
Simon… ] ] PIXEL ] The Christian kid who wants to lead ] advertiser
boycotts when he grows ] up…Oh please, somebody a little ] more jalapeno
than that. ] ] TALIA ] When you said find someone for ] Hayley, you did
mean “dancing,” ] right? ] ] PIXEL ] Yeah, yeah, but it wouldn’t hurt ]
for her to feel something small and ] firm rub up against her leg. ] ]
TALIA ] Jesus Pixel…How about bedwetter ] Ted? Good-looking. Clever. And
it’ll ] be my insurance that they don’t end ] up in the sack together. ]
] PIXEL ] Nice, nice, Hayley is always looking ] at Ted and she’s too
cool to tease ] about the urine thing. Let’s work ] it. We’ll each tell
one that the ] other thinks they’re cute… ] ] TALIA ] Let’s go–Oh, and I
know who’s ] perfect for Darlene… ] ] Taking to the crowd, Talia and
Pixel burst from each other, ] revealing behind them: Adam leading one
of his campers ] through a practice slow dance with Bob Dole grace as
other ] Adam-Campers study from the side. ] ] ADAM ] A slow dance is a
light moving hug. ] Don’t force anything. Be her shadow. ] ] Adam
glances to Jasper, who raises up a cup in a “toast” ] motion. Adam tries
to glower, but half-smiles. ]</p>
<p><strong>jasper ]</strong>: ] sips his cup and turns to Caleb. ] ]
CALEB ] She’s just going to say no. Or laugh. ] What was it like the
first time you ] asked a girl to slow-dance? ] ] JASPER ] I’ll have to

you’re a good ] guy. Dorothy’s going to like you. ] ] Jasper watches
Caleb head to Crush-Girl Dorothy. Jasper turns ] to his other side where
Andrew cheekily sits. ] ] JASPER ] Why aren’t you out there? ] ] ANDREW
] Is that an invitation? ] ] JASPER ] ] No. It’s not. ] ] ANDREW ] Girls
dance together. Why can’t ] guys… ] ] JASPER ] Well, actually they can.
But ] not…uh, I have to go check on the ] next song… ]</p>
<p><strong>by the dj area ]</strong>: ] Donald presses a button and an
Acid Jazzy version of ] “Kumbaya” comes over the speakers. Donald turns
to poignantly ] watch the young and younger couples clumsily come
together. ] ] The bespectacled Donaldish Cosmo is dancing with his ]
rendezvous partner. He gives Donald a salute, which the ] counselor
sadly returns. Suddenly, wordlessly, the darkly ] garbed Wendy appears
and pulls Donald out onto the dance ] floor dirt. ]</p>

RED-CAPPED TEASER ] Hey Bedwetter Ted, too bad your dry ] spell’s over.

curls to Adam’s dance partner, ] Pixel. Pixel’s eyes float down the
backside of Wendy. ] ] Wendy’s partner, Donald, floats on air, his face
beaming ] out of control. The viewer’s viewpoint twists around to the ]
stony of expression of Wendy. She is, in turn, glaring out ] to Wichita

important–eight white guys ] sitting around a conference table ] arguing
about tax hikes and budget ] cuts? We are two people who gave each other
their hearts. Two people who knew they were not alike, but… ] Fucking
mosquitoes! We challenged ] each other–we created ideas!–we ] were about
to change the world, but ] instead we threw it all away to have ] sex a
bunch of times. ] ] WICHITA ] Do you hear how pretentious you sound? ] ]
WENDY ] Ooh, “pretentious.” Yeah, I have ] pretensions, you dick! You
just want ] to tear everything down without ] putting anything else back
up. ]</p>
<p><strong>wichita</strong>: What do you want from me? You want the good
stuff. You want to know that my father, in the three years ] before he
died, only had custody ] of me for the summer and he sent ] me to camp.
You want to hear that ] I thought that was the only decent ] thing he
ever did. Here’s another ] good one: I was misdiagnosed as ]
schizophrenic at 14 and given a bunch ] of poison that almost killed me.
] Keep going? ] ] WENDY ] Oh Wichita… ] ] WICHITA ] Don’t “Oh Wichita”
me. I refused ] to be defined by such bullshit ] trivia. I take that
back, I’m defined ] by that shit and all sorts of other ] shit that you
can’t rip out of me. ] I don’t want to be cured! That’s what makes me a
good camp counselor, because I protect who I am and I pass that on. I
make the kids question things; I teach them how to get through life,
decode it, attack it…</p>
<p><strong>wendy ]</strong>: There’s got to be more to living ] than
surviving… ]</p>
<p><strong>int. main bathroom–night</strong>: ] The viewer tracks across
a line of sinks where adrenaline- ] geysering campers expertly fill
condoms and water balloons. ] At the end of the line, Donald confers
with expert ] Troublemaker Billy. ] ] TROUBLEMAKER BILLY ] Always aim
for the face. When it ] comes to water balloons, a body hit ] is
pointless. ] ] DONALD ] Thanks, Billy. Coach the others. ]</p>
<p><strong>the kids ]</strong>: ] inventively store their water weapons
into bags, fanny packs, ] sweatshirt pouches, and backpacks. ]</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: All the magazine polls say that the trait
most looked for in a lover is a “sense of humor”! Now <u>that’s</u>
funny! I’m the most hilarious fucking guy in the world and I have never
touched a human breast! But I digress, let’s do this attack for all of
us who have ever been told “Wait here, while the rest of us have all the
fun.” For all of us who have been told “You’re too young and uncool to
understand.” Let’s do this attack because it’s not like we have anything
better to do tonight. Are you with me?</p>
<p><strong>oberon narration (v.o.) ]</strong>: In all the excitement,
came to some, ] uh, last-night-epiphanies of my ] own… ]</p>
<p><strong>oberon</strong>: What was I thinking, taking all this time
off, playing God? Nobody tells you how to be an adult. But you just keep
getting older anyway. That girl almost died! We needed an authority
figure on that beach today! Is it too much to ask for a little order! Is
it too much to…</p>
<p><strong>oberon ]</strong>: You children should be in bed! That’s ]
it, I’m subtracting major points! ]</p>
<p><strong>ext. the non-sexual couple’s patch of the forest–night
]</strong>: ] The camper army makes a swift ninja sweep through the ]
romantically carved-up forest. ] ] The Stoner Lug and the
African-American SuperCounselor break ] from each other and drop their
smiles. Lined across like ] an execution squad, the campers fire away
with their water ] packed weapons. The counselors slam back against
their ] initialed tree. ]</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: You think you’re so…but you’re just…</p>
<p><strong>pixel</strong>: That’s it, Adam, pretend it’s one of those
arcade things, the tighter you squeeze, the more of a man you are…Ooh,
that’s it.</p>
<p><strong>adam ]</strong>: You meant something to me! I’m almost ] sure
of it. Damn you! ]</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Damnit, spermicidally lubricated!</p>
<p><strong>wendy ]</strong>: Have you ever thought of instead ] of
making children more equipped ] for reality, we should make reality ]
more equipped for children? ]</p>
<p><strong>wichita</strong>: No. Fuck no. If you met yourself as a
child, would you hug her and say everything’s going to be okay…</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Yes! God yes! I would tell her that I love
her! To not let anyone take away her dreams..!</p>
<p><strong>wichita ]</strong>: You should grab her and shake her ] and
tell her it’s a goddamn war out ] there. Idiots and assholes and ]
sadists that must be defeated. Tell ] them her the truth! ] ] WENDY ]
The truth is a lie! Yes, television ] is rotting our brains! Yes, people
] kill people easier than ever! Does ] that mean we give up! I think
every ] child is capable of being talented, ] happy, and great. I’m
probably wrong, ] but you know something, it’s good ] to be wrong. ] ]
WICHITA ] ] You might be right…Wendy, you’re ] fantastic. I can’t stop
adoring ] you… ] ] What I thought was lust, was only ] love…You think
I’m scared, scared ] of love…Love conquers all…Maybe ] I don’t want to
be conquered. “Share ] my life”–I barely got enough for ] myself…But we
were in the picture ] together…the picture…. ] ] WENDY ] What are you
talking about? What ] picture… ] ] WICHITA Just forget–You didn’t bring
me out here to help me change. You brought me out here to punish me.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Nobody really changes at summer camp. They
merely find out who they are and become it more than ever. You can’t be
helped, Wichita. I’m not sure you can be punished, either. But let’s
find out…</p>
<p><strong>wichita ]</strong>: How do you mean? ]</p>
<p><strong>wendy ]</strong>: Two billion years of evolution and ] you’re
what we’ve come up with– ] “Wichita”–the hot, cool, tell-it- ]
like-it-is counselor with a dark ] side. ]</p>
<p><strong>wichita</strong>: What are you doing, Wendy? What’s in that
cup?</p>
<p><strong>wendy ]</strong>: “Wichita”–The guy every boy wants ] to be
and every girl wants to hold. ] You’re the love of my life and the ] end
of the world. Cheers. ]</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Great shot! Todd, I think we finally found
something you totally suck at. High-five!</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Don’t touch me.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: Now!</p>
<p><strong>int. adam’s cabin–night ]</strong>: ] Adam slicks back his
wet hair, making it look as short as ] it originally was. He fo-fums
past his sleeping campers to ] focus upon the Teaser from the dance
floor, snoozing while ] still wearing his familiar red cap. Adam unzips
his pants. ] A streaming sound is heard. ]</p>
<p><strong>ext. the porch of donald’s cabin–night ]</strong>: ] A very
content Donald is revealed to be playing <u>the</u> banjo ] upon his
porch. Banging water from his ear, Wichita pauses ] before the porch. ]
] WICHITA ] Have a good time, tonight, Donald? ] ] DONALD ] Yes. Nice of
you to ask. ] ] WICHITA ] Pretty enthusiastic balloon tossing. ] You
have a thing for Wendy, don’t ] you? All this time, sharing my ]
feelings with the competition… ] ] Donald stops playing the banjo. ] ]
DONALD ] I’m not the competition. I’m ] just…me. A person shouldn’t be ]
allowed to have a crush on someone ] they don’t have a chance with. A ]
buzzer should go off, like when your ] seat belt is not on. ] ] WICHITA
] ] I’m gonna miss you, Donald Dark. ] ] DONALD ] Wichita…How could you
hurt her– ] how could you hurt yourself. I had ] one slow dance with
Wendy and for ] me, that made for a great summer. ] You did
<u>everything</u> with her–and ] you’re still not satisfied. I don’t ]
understand. I guess I never want to ] be that cool– I mean, Wendy is a ]
dream come true. ] ] WICHITA ] ] That’s right, Daffy. <u>A</u> dream. I
] have a lot of them…Lot of dreams… ] ] A little unconvinced of himself,
Wichita smokes off. Donald ] raises back up his banjo and starts playing
again. Faster. ]</p>
<p><strong>int. oberon’s office–night ]</strong>: ] To the sound of this
more malevolent music, a waterlogged ] Oberon bangs into the disarray of
his office. Trembling, ] Oberon heaves up the crashed bookshelf from the
ground and ] carefully places in it a lone, discarded camp workbooklet.
] ] Oberon catches his reflection in a mirror. He touches his ] beard.
Oberon then opens the mirror, revealing a shiny pair ] of scissors.
]</p>
<p><strong>oberon</strong>: Camp is over. Rise. Shine. Now. You can pick
up all your “missing” crap ] in the mess hall. Move it. ]</p>
<p><strong>int. the adam’s cabin–day ]</strong>: ] The Red Capped Teaser
awakens and adjusts his trademark head- ] piece. He smells something.
Feels something. Screaming as ] if it were a severed horse’s head, he
whips off his sheet, ] revealing a vivid urine stain. The campers laugh
away. ] ] Bedwetter Ted smiles toward Adam, but Adam moodily shuts ] his
duffel and pounds out the door. ]</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: I’m sorry. It just…It seems silly. Like
kissing a girl.</p>
<p><strong>pixel</strong>: Clever observation. Go back to Wichita. Oh
that’s right, you can’t.</p>
<p><strong>pixel</strong>: …sorry…</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: This is not the way it was supposed to– I was
going to start writing a children’s book using input from all– I don’t
even like smoking!</p>
<p><strong>pixel</strong>: One day they’ll find a cure for AIDS. They’ll
never find one for sex. It’s kind of funny, most movies and stories with
a bunch of camp counselors has some serial psycho in the woods with a
chainsaw who systematically butchers everybody one by one.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Yeah. And?</p>
<p><strong>pixel</strong>: It’s just funny…who needs a serial psycho in
the woods with a chainsaw when we have ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: There you are! Man, I don’t know how to
thank…</p>
<p><strong>wichita</strong>: Eric…You can’t be like me. You have to be
better. I’m not the guy you think I am…</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Of course you are. You don’t know what I was
like before I met you. You’re like the best counselor ever.</p>
<p><strong>oberon ]</strong>: Is <u>that</u> what you call packing your
] gear? Sub-standard! You’re not getting ] on that bus until… ]</p>
<p><strong>jasper and pixel ]</strong>: ] watch the re-brutalized Camp
director from a distance. ] ] JASPER ] I actually kind of missed him. ]
] PIXEL ] You’re kidding. ] ] JASPER ] Of course I’m kidding. See ya, ]
sweetie… ]</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: I’m gay. Like you didn’t know.</p>
<p><strong>jasper</strong>: Andrew. You’re not gay; you’re ten. You
shouldn’t even be having thoughts like…</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: You mean you didn’t have any gay thoughts
when you were my age…</p>
<p><strong>jasper</strong>: Well, uh…Promise me you won’t do anything
until you’re 18.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Did you wait until you were 18?</p>
<p><strong>jasper ]</strong>: I can’t remember. Andrew, this is ]
serious. If you do anything, I mean ] anything, ever in your life, use ]
a condom. ] ] ANDREW ] Have you always used a condom? ]</p>
<p><strong>jasper</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: I’ll bet you’re glad I waited until the last
day to have this conversation.</p>
<p><strong>jasper</strong>: You have no idea. Now run away.</p>
<p><strong>adam ]</strong>: ] is cut off by a giddy Bedwetter Ted. ] ]
BEDWETTER TED ] Adam, that was awesome, what you ] did back there,
pissing in that ] asshole’s bed. Did you see the look ] on… ] ] ADAM ]
Get the fuck away from me. ] ] Bedwetter Ted is stopped dead. Adam
pounds forward, up to ] Troublemaker Billy. ] ] ADAM ] Hey. Kid. Keep
giving ’em hell. Don’t ] let anyone ever take a piece of you. ] ] Adam
takes off his whistle and drapes it over Billy’s neck. ]</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Summer would have been a lot less without
you. You’re a true friend, Donald.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: Was there a night that I got really drunk
and declared that I never loved anyone as much as I loved you?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: That’s good. I wouldn’t have wanted to
embarrass myself.</p>
<p><strong>talia ]</strong>: I hate the cliche that two female ] friends
will tear each other apart ] over a guy. ] ] WENDY ] Good thing we were
never friends. ] ] TALIA ] ] Ooh–Wendy with the last minute sense ] of
humor. ] ] WENDY ] Hope you’re not jealous of me. Me ] and Wichita–I
guess you heard. ] ] TALIA ] For what it’s worth, Wendy, I find ] you
more interesting when you’re ] unhappy. ] ] WENDY ] Aren’t we all… ]</p>
<p><strong>weeping cute boy ]</strong>: But I loved you so much… ] ]
AMBER, THE LOVELORN GIRL ] You’ll live. ]</p>
<p><strong>at the back of the bus ]</strong>: ] Adam turns away from the
glass and strenuously pushes his ] hair back. The Endlessly Muttering
Girl seats herself down ] next to him to haywire his thoughts. ] ]
MUTTERING GIRL ] My-uncle-used-to-drive-the-Grand- ]
Canyon-Bus-but-he-was-fired- ] because-he-slapped-an-Australian. ]
My-favorite-food-is-Chinese-food, ] my-second-favorite… ] ] Adam glares
to the girl and then bolts up. ]</p>
<p><strong>ryan, ex-golden boy ]</strong>: Thanks Eric. I’ll get you
back, I ] swear. ] ] ERIC ] Man, get some help. ]</p>
<p><strong>talia ]</strong>: That was fun last night, Donald. ] ] DONALD
] Feel bad you turned me down on the ] mountain? ] ] TALIA ] ] No, but
that was fun last night, ] Donald. ] Another day. Another dollar.
Literally. I think I’ll cash this and buy myself a…pizza.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: Hey, we didn’t do this for the money, we did
it for…help me out…</p>
<p><strong>oberon narration (v.o.) ]</strong>: As long as it continues
to feel good, ] the young are not going to stop ] taking drugs, getting
drunk, having ] sex, and watching crap media. Even ] a parody of a
grown-up like me knows ] they’re will never be a return to ]
old-fashioned values–But that ] doesn’t mean we won’t get some new ]
fashioned ones. Coming of age in ] the 21st century is less about the ]
loss of innocence, then the finding ] of it. Wendy, Wichita, Talia,
Adam, ] Jasper, Pixel, and Donald Dark were ] reborn this summer. And it
hurt. ] And that’s good. ]</p>
<p><strong>oberon (v.o.) ]</strong>: “You’ll learn the true meaning of ]
responsibility, while creating ] memories that last a lifetime.” The ]
workbooklet is not bullshitting. ] It’s just pretty fucking sketchy ] on
the details. ]</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: Oh no, I’m sorry, I refuse to go out with
this doom-and-gloom. I’m getting a picture from you complex individuals.
Hold on, let’s get a kid in here…</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: Now stop pretending you didn’t have any good
times…Shooting stars. Frogs down pants. Surely, at some point, one of us
watched a baby deer being born. Come on…Smi-ile.</p>
<p><strong>oberon (v.o.) ]</strong>: I know, I know, our tale is
supposed ] to have a happy ending. Okay, this ] may not be happy, but
look on the ] bright side, it’s not an ending ] either. Life is a lot
like death, ] it happens to everyone whether they ] like it or not. It’s
going to be ] beautiful-ugly, exciting-boring, ] endless-abrupt– So go
ahead, smile. ] God bless my counselors and campers, ] in a small but
significant forest- ] in-the-middle-of-Oregon way, they ] tried to
destroy the cliches of ] growing up and come up with some ] better ones.
Let’s not get uptight ] over their ultimate failure…I mean, ] there’s
always next summer. ]</p>
<p><strong>oberon (o.s.) ]</strong>: …no smoking, no drinking, no ]
climbing the mountain… ] ] WISECRACKING FEMALE COUNSELOR ] Can you
believe this cover? Where ] do they get these giddy freaks? ] ] MALE
COUNSELOR WITH ARTIFICIAL LEG ] More importantly, what drugs do they ]
give them…And where can we get ] these drugs? ] ] OBERON ] “…the true
meaning of ] responsibility while creating ] memories that last…” ] ]
The counselors’ tension-breaking laughter melts back into ] tension as a
convoy of Buses rumble to a stop nearby. All ] the counselors charge up,
except for a LOVELY FEMALE REDHEAD ] COUNSELOR and a HANDSOME,
AFRICAN-AMERICAN MALE COUNSELOR. ] ] LOVELY FEMALE REDHEAD COUNSELOR ] I
have a feeling this summer is going ] to really suck… ] ] LIKABLE BLACK
MALE COUNSELOR ] Do you mean that in the good way ] or the bad way? ] ]
The novice counselors turn to make instantly smitten eye- ] contact. The
Lovely Female Counselor enchantingly shrugs ] her shoulders. ] ] LOVELY
FEMALE REDHEAD COUNSELOR ] ] Iunno. ] ] The counselors both suddenly
turn, along with the viewer, ] to the sight of the bus doors opening.
