<p><strong>the s a i n t</strong>: by Jonathan Hensleigh Director:
Phillip Noyce February 8, 1995 New York City</p>
<p><strong>fade in:</strong>: The majestic city and bay, as seen from
the elevation of the surrounding Shan Ho hills as we SUPER �</p>
<p><strong>int. hong kong - saint ignatius orphanage - day</strong>:
Twenty boys, aged 7 to 12, sit at spartan desks, bibles raised. FATHER
O’NEAL walks amongst them. A career Jesuit with razor eyes and thin
lips. An awful man.</p>
<p><strong>father 0’neal</strong>: Sumeria. And what happened to him
Francis?</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Jesus’ disciples came and performed
miracles. When Simon Magus saw the miracles he offered disciple Peter
gold for the powers of God.</p>
<p><strong>father 0’neal</strong>: What did disciple Peter say to that?
Michael Quinn?</p>
<p><strong>father 0’neal</strong>: Answer the question Michael.</p>
<p><strong>michael quinn</strong>: That’s not my name.</p>
<p><strong>int. saint ignatius orphanage - eating hall - night</strong>:
THE BOYS sit at benches. Michael Quinn stares stoically ahead. The back
of his shirt is striped with blood.</p>
<p><strong>father yin</strong>: Why one child is born into a good home
and another into poverty - that is but part of God’s design. All of you
are unwanted, put here because of the sins of your unwedded mothers. The
church has fed you and educated you. Given you a home. A name. An
identity.</p>
<p><strong>father yin</strong>: Who is that, boy?</p>
<p><strong>michael quinn</strong>: Father Michael Quinn.</p>
<p><strong>father yin</strong>: Yes. A great man. You ungrateful little
cur, you will sit here without food until you appreciate your namesake.
All of you will sit with him. Put lunch away, Mr. Fong.</p>
<p><strong>int. orphanage - night</strong>: Again, Father Yin stands
before Michael Quinn. The boys are seated for their evening meal.</p>
<p><strong>father yin</strong>: What is your name, boy?</p>
<p><strong>father yin</strong>: Put supper away, Mr. Fong.</p>
<p><strong>int . orphanage bunkroom - night</strong>: A long, narrow
room with bunkbeds. The boys aren’t sleeping. They’re grouped around
Michael Quinn’s bunk. One boy has his hand clamped to Michael’s, mouth,
the others are wailing on him… and outside –</p>
<p><strong>int. orphanage - corridor outside bunkroom - night</strong>:
Fathers O’Neal and Yin watch through the door.</p>
<p><strong>father yin</strong>: Spareth the rod, spoileth the child.</p>
<p><strong>int. orphanage - morning</strong>: Father Yin grits his
teeth, staring down at Michael Quinn, whose face is welted. Nothing has
changed.</p>
<p><strong>father yin</strong>: Put breakfast away, Mr. Fong.</p>
<p><strong>michael quinn</strong>: Stop. You’ll have your breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: They should’ve named you Simon, like Simon
Magus the sorcerer.</p>
<p><strong>michael quinn</strong>: No. Simon. . . . …Templar.</p>
<p><strong>father yin</strong>: Who.. . who did this…? The boys look at
Michael Quinn. Then Francis speaks:</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: I did father. And another boy, James:</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: I did father. .</p>
<p><strong>ext. st. petersburg, russia - night</strong>: A chilly
September night. A rally is underway in the Dvortsovaya Ploshchad, the
vast square at the foot of Nevsky Prospect Boulevard. The Winter Palace
and Hermitage loom in the b.g. 500,000 ST. PETERS BURGERS’ stand
shoulder-to-shoulder, listening to a SPEECH. INTERNATIONAL T.V. CREWS
are transmitting the event.</p>
<p><strong>romanov</strong>: In 1987 Gorbachev stood here and promised a
new age. The result? An end to communism. Democracy. A free economy. And
what else? Chaos. The economy run by criminals, the government run by
charlatans. And they are in league together! Thieves! Traitors! Men and
women of St. Petersburg, citizens of Russia, the salt of this country,
this must end! Join me then in the song of our forefathers. Romanov
begins to sing, ably, the first verse of “Mother Russia” .</p>
<p><strong>int. nikko hotel - grand foyer ballroom</strong>: – A
JAPANESE SECURITY MAN sits at his guard station, watching C.N.N. NEWS on
a small television. Wolf Blitzer is reporting live from the rally.</p>
<p><strong>wolf blitzer</strong>: An extraordinary allegation, Bernard,
that Russia’s present leadership, including President Victor Karpov, is
connected with the country’s underworld.</p>
<p><strong>hiro myaki</strong>: Ladies. Gentlemen. The Myaki Corporation
looks forward to many profitable days ahead. To our new manufacturing
facility in St. Petersburg. To the new Russia!</p>
<p><strong>ext. nikko hotel - exterior wall</strong>: …the Man In Black
kicks at the cut section of window, pushing it into the hotel and
plunging inside after it.</p>
<p><strong>int. nikko hotel - ceiling superstructure</strong>: The Man
In Black catches hold of a steel girder and dangles, and, miraculously
–</p>
<p><strong>in the lobby below</strong>: Everybody’s beaming, toasting,
congratulating, etc., totally oblivious to THE MAN IN BLACK, 12 stories
up, inching hand-over-hand across the roof superstructure.</p>
<p><strong>int. nikko hotel - ceiling superstructure over
mezzanine</strong>: The Man In Black has reached the mezzanine. TWO
JAPANESE SECURITY GUARDS, armed with automatic rifles, walk their shift
directly below him. They pass a wall mounted television, also carrying
the NEWS:</p>
<p><strong>wolf blitzer</strong>: One thing’s certain, Bernard: Michael
Romanov, age 32, French born and Oxford educated, descendent of the last
czar, is a political force to be reckoned with.</p>
<p><strong>int. nikko hotel - interior corridor</strong>: A long
corridor with a door at the end, on which is engraved: MYAKI
CORPORATION. At the entrance, secured in a niche, is a BRONZE BUST
OF</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Sorry about this.</p>
<p><strong>int. nikko hotel - mezzanine - elevator lobby</strong>: The
Japanese guards are smoking by the elevator, joking, laughing. One of
these guys is a riot… The elevator opens. The CHAMPAGNE SERVER comes
out, tray in hand.</p>
<p><strong>champagne server</strong>: Compliments of Mr. Myaki.</p>
<p><strong>japanese guards</strong>: Ahh!</p>
<p><strong>int. nikko hotel - interior corridor</strong>: The computer
BEEPS. It’s finished. Templar turns the door handle; pushes open the
door. He pulls himself up. Hangs from his hands again. He swings his
legs back and forth, getting momentum up. He releases from the glider
and lunges inside.</p>
<p><strong>int. nikko hotel - myaki corporation offices</strong>: A
grand boardroom with Japanese furniture and art. At the end of a
fifty-foot mahogany table is a PAINTING OF HIRO MYAKI. Templar walks
over to it.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Sorry again.</p>
<p><strong>int. nikko hotel - mezzanine lobby</strong>: Two CHAMPAGNE
GLASSES lie shattered on the floor, and next to that mess lie the
JAPANESE GUARDS, now unconscious. The champagne server’s gone…</p>
<p><strong>int. nikko hotel - mezzanine</strong>: …because he’s here,
moving quickly toward the Myaki Corporation’s office, and he’s not a
champagne server, but a thief and a killer, a blonde Russian named ILYA.
Ilya stops just outside the interior corridor. With the GUARD’S KEYRING,
he shuts off the anti-theft mats and moves around the corner into the
corridor.</p>
<p><strong>int. nikko hotel - interior corridor</strong>: Ilya stops
short. His eyes spark. He sees Templar’s cable and glider.</p>
<p><strong>int. nikko hotel - myaki corporation offices</strong>:
Templar, wearing goggles, leans into the drill as THE BIT CHEWS into the
tungsten lock. This is a violent exercise. SINEWS OF METAL spit out like
shrapnel.</p>
<p><strong>ilya</strong>: On your knees. Give me the box. Slowly.</p>
<p><strong>int. nikko hotel - mezzanine</strong>: Templar runs to the
balustrade and climbs atop it.</p>
<p><strong>int. nikko hotel - grand foyer ballroom</strong>: – A
JAPANESE WOMAN, looking up, pointing at the man dangling from the
balustrade above, SCREAMS. And now everybody looks up.</p>
<p><strong>hiro myaki</strong>: Sound the alarm! Call the police!</p>
<p><strong>int. nikko hotel - mezzanine</strong>: Ilya and Templar. Ilya
calmly compresses his foot against Templar’s left knuckles.</p>
<p><strong>ilya</strong>: The box please.</p>
<p><strong>int. nikko hotel - ceiling superstructure</strong>: Templar
ties the cable to the ceiling girder. He pulls out his black hood and
drapes it over the taught cable. He grabs both ends of the hood. And he
jumps.</p>
<p><strong>ext. nikko hotel/adjacent building</strong>: Templar flies
through space, across the cable, the hood acting as a makeshift glider.
He lands on the roof of the adjacent building. Templar looks around.
SIRENS ARE WAILING. He runs across rooftops, disappearing into the
St. Petersburg night.</p>
<p><strong>int . nikko hotel - grand foyer ballroom</strong>: Total
chaos. Women screaming, everybody running around. Ilya comes through the
panicked crowd. Ten ST. PETERSBURG POLICEMEN enter.</p>
<p><strong>ilya</strong>: I tried to stop him! He went out the
window!</p>
<p><strong>ext. nikko hotel - entrance</strong>: The befuddled police
race off, looking skyward at the top floors of the building. Ilya curses
silently. And peels away from the cops and commotion, off into the
night.</p>
<p><strong>int. a british-air 747 - morning</strong>: The First Class
section. The plane is in flight. A STEWARDESS, young, perky, comes down
the aisle pushing a magazine/newspaper cart.</p>
<p><strong>stewardess</strong>: Newspaper sir?</p>
<p><strong>stewardess</strong>: Wow, are those gorgeous or what…</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: You have an eye for beauty. Of course - you
see it every time you look in the mirror.</p>
<p><strong>stewardess</strong>: Why thank-you, Mr… Templar.</p>
<p><strong>int. british air 747 - five hours later</strong>: The plane
has landed. PASSENGERS are filing out past the Stewardess.</p>
<p><strong>stewardess</strong>: Goodbye, goodbye, enjoy your stay in
London, etc.</p>
<p><strong>stewardess</strong>: Good-bye, Mr. Templar.</p>
<p><strong>int. london - heathrow airport</strong>: Templar walks
briskly away from customs. A MAN IN TRENCHCOAT falls in behind Templar.
TWO MEN appear in front of Templar, blocking his path; the man behind
Templar comes to his side. They are Scotland Yard men BAKER, TEAL, and
INSPECTOR MACDUFF.</p>
<p><strong>inspector macduff</strong>: How’s the weather in
St. Petersburg?</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Cold.</p>
<p><strong>inspector macduff</strong>: Let’s warm things up for you.</p>
<p><strong>int. heathrow customs - interrogation room</strong>: A
spartan room, a table and two chairs. MacDuff ransacks TEMPLAR’S BAGS
while, across the room –</p>
<p><strong>baker</strong>: He’s clean.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Careful with that. It’s delicate equip…</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: . . . ment.</p>
<p><strong>macduff</strong>: Yes. Very.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: It’s for protection. I deal in
antique….</p>
<p><strong>macduff</strong>: I know what you deal in. And these? Your
pajamas?</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: For jogging. My doctor’s recommended five
miles a…</p>
<p><strong>macduff</strong>: Sit down and shut it.</p>
<p><strong>baker</strong>: He’s licensed to carry, Inspector.</p>
<p><strong>macduff</strong>: Let’s see the passport. What’s your
nationality this week, Templar?</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: I forget.</p>
<p><strong>macduff</strong>: Issued by the Principality of.. . Yemen?
You’re bloody joking.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Call the embassy</p>
<p><strong>macduff</strong>: Shut it.</p>
<p><strong>macduff</strong>: You pass through Russia for a day with that
gear and, what a surprise, a prototype computer chip worth quarter of a
billion quid is nicked from the Myaki Corporation the night you arrive.
We know you didn’t fence it in Russia. Where is it?</p>
<p><strong>teal</strong>: All negative. He didn’t swallow it.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: You’ve got three options: charge me, or
release me.</p>
<p><strong>macduff</strong>: What’s the third.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: You can kiss my ass.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: I’m a busy man. Make up your mind.</p>
<p><strong>int. london restaurant - evening</strong>: A quaint place off
Piccadilly. The STEWARDESS gulps a martini. She is tipsy. She shows
it.</p>
<p><strong>stewardess</strong>: .. . then me mum says, call uncle
Charlie, he’s in the airline business, there’s jobs there, good benefits
too, and.. ..where was I?</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: How you got your job.</p>
<p><strong>stewardess</strong>: Right! ’Scuze me.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Another round please.</p>
<p><strong>stewardess</strong>: Ye’re tryin’ ta get me drunk, aren’t
you? Are you cute or what? I gotta freshen up. Where’s the loo in
’ere?</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Back there. Leave your locket. I’ll polish
it for you.</p>
<p><strong>stewardess</strong>: Are you a dearheart or what…</p>
<p><strong>back to scene - following the stewardess</strong>: as she
returns to the table. She sits down. Looks around. Templar’s gone. The
locket’s gone. The waitress appears.</p>
<p><strong>stewardess</strong>: Maam, where’s the gent who was sitting
’ere?</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: He left, luv. Said you’d take care of the
bill.</p>
<p><strong>stewardess</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>int. london - musgrave hotel</strong>: A small, plush,
discrete residential hotel in the heart of Mayfair . TEMPLAR approaches
the front desk with his carry-on bags. CONCIERGE HARRY WINSTON and the
HOTEL MANAGER are behind the desk.</p>
<p><strong>concierge harry winston</strong>: Mr. Templar! Good to see
you sir. Your room key - south penthouse as usual. Your suits are up
from storage, pressed of course, and there’s a bottle of Oban on the
dresser.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Thanks Harry. Oh, and Harry… .. . ship this
by overnight courier to that address.</p>
<p><strong>concierge harry winston</strong>: Very good sir.</p>
<p><strong>concierge harry winston</strong>: Jimmy, Mr. Templar carries
his own bags.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy the bellman</strong>: What’s with the bags,
gov’nuh?</p>
<p><strong>hotel manager</strong>: They’re all he ever brings. The man’s
bills are paid by a bank in Switzerland and his mailing address is a
corporation in Lisbon. Bloody strange…</p>
<p><strong>concierge harry winston</strong>: Mr. Templar, strange? No
sir, he’s just shy.</p>
<p><strong>int . musgrave hotel - south penthouse</strong>: Ternplar
sits at a desk with a bottle of Oban scotch and glass, staring at the
screen of a modemed MINI-COMPUTER.</p>
<p><strong>balance</strong>: U.S. $47,895,12S.12</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Is this Simon Templar?</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: It depends.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: A meeting. Midnight, Blackfriars Bridge.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Involving what?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: A lot of money. If you want it.</p>
<p><strong>int. musgrave hotel lobby - later - night</strong>: Templar
enters the lobby wearing a fresh suit under a black leather trench coat.
He goes to the desk, where concierge Harry Winston looks up.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Harry, I’m going for a walk over
Blackfriars Bridge. Midnight.</p>
<p><strong>harry winston</strong>: Very good, sir.</p>
<p><strong>harry winston</strong>: Jimmy It’s about time I taught you
how to run the front desk.</p>
<p><strong>ext. london - blackfriar’ s bridge - midnight</strong>: Fog.
The bridge lights cast everything in a sickly yellow glow. Below, A
TUGBOAT plows the river, horn BELLOWING. The lights of Southwark twinkle
beyond.</p>
<p><strong>tretiak</strong>: Interesting. You are not a big man. But men
like you never are. It is my pleasure, Simon Templar. My name is…</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: I know who you are. Tell me what you want,
or I keep walking.</p>
<p><strong>tretiak</strong>: Suppose I don’t want anything. Suppose I
want to kill you.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Suppose there’s a high-powered rifle
trained at your head.</p>
<p><strong>tretiak</strong>: Rumour has not lied about you, Mr. Templar.
Last night something was stolen in St. Petersburg. My city.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: You talk about the place as if you own
it.</p>
<p><strong>tretiak</strong>: I do, Mr. Templar. May I ask who hired
you?</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: You can ask. I won’t answer.</p>
<p><strong>tretiak</strong>: What you stole I wanted very badly.
Ilya.</p>
<p><strong>tretiak</strong>: What is the saying - if you can’t beat
them, why not join them? An American phrase, no? Or are you British?
Australian?</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: I’m nothing. Except bored. Get to the
point.</p>
<p><strong>tretiak</strong>: Of course. An American scientist has worked
ten years to develop a certain technology. I am informed that the
technology will be made public at the annual nuclear science symposium
in Washington D.C. I would like the plans and specifications for this
technology. Before the symposium.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: What are we talking about?</p>
<p><strong>tretiak</strong>: A nuclear fusion generator. We have a man
on the inside.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Why can’t he steal it?</p>
<p><strong>tretiak</strong>: He’s tried. The scientist trusts no one and
keeps no hard records of the technology in the lab.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Nuclear fusion. They say it’s mankind’s
only hope after all the oil’s gone. This guy’s actually done it?</p>
<p><strong>tretiak</strong>: She.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Come again?</p>
<p><strong>tretiak</strong>: She, Mr. Templar. The scientist is a woman.
Her dossier. All the information you will need.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: My fee is fifteen million U.S. dollars,
half up front, half when I deliver. You’ll hear from me.</p>
<p><strong>tretiak</strong>: Templar, one question.</p>
<p><strong>tretiak</strong>: I ask you to steal a person’s entire life’s
work. You have no reaction. Are you that cold?</p>
<p><strong>tretiak</strong>: No, rumor hasn’t lied about you,
Templar.</p>
<p><strong>ext. westchester county - establishing shots</strong>:
Various establishing shots of this suburban community just north of
Manhattan. Pretty, charming, affluent.</p>
<p><strong>int. westchester county - supermarket</strong>: A large
suburban supermarket. The aisles are full of Westchester women:
affluent, country clubby, housewifey types. A HAND reaches for a BOTTLE
OF LEMONADE , bringing it down to the eye level of –</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: Filtered water, high fructose corn syrup.
Lemon juice concentrate. Citric acid. Gum acacia…? Totally natural, yeah
right.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Try this. Sorry, I overheard. The real
thing. No chemicals, no preservatives.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>int. supermarket - produce section - minutes later</strong>:
Jillian is examining apples. There is a THUMPING NOISE. It persists.
Finally she looks over at –</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Hello again. These aren’t ripe. How are the
apples?</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: Excellent. They’re in season.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: I wonder why He didn’t want us to eat
these.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: God. In the Garden of Eden.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: Oh right. Sorry, little slow today. Bad
headache. Uhm, actually, I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Why wasn’t it: “No bananas.” Or: “Avoid, at
all cost, kumquats.” Wonder what God had against apples. She gives him a
funny look and turns away.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: Sorry. Can’t help you.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: How about William Tell? You really think he
shot one of these off his brother’s head with an arrow?</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: Do I know you?</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Unlikely. I just moved to New York.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: Well uhhm, sir, to answer your apple
questions, one, I don’t know what God’s problem was. Two, William Tell,
like Paul Bunyon, never existed. And in case you’re wondering, Isaac
Newton discovered gravity through planetary observation not because one
of those fell on his head, and I seriously doubt that eating one a day
will keep the doctor away. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: By the way - welcome to the Big Apple.</p>
<p><strong>int. jillian’s station wagon - driving</strong>: Jillian,
driving, drinking her lemonade, listens to a cassette tape. An
authoritative, scholarly, Indian voice:</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: No, really? Moron.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: C’mon, Dr. Singh. Tell me something I don’t
know.</p>
<p><strong>jillian’s pov - through windshield</strong>: A ROLLS ROYCE
sits on the road shoulder. As we pass the Rolls, we see SIMON TEMPLAR
standing next to it wearing a hopeless expression.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene - jillian</strong>: looks at the Rolls in the
rear-view mirror. She frowns.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: Just keep driving.</p>
<p><strong>ext. westchester - suburban road shoulder - day</strong>:
Jillian’s station wagon backs up to the Rolls Royce on the road
shoulder. Jillian gets out.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Hello! She walks up to him. Together they
look down at THE REAR TIRE. It’s flat, a pancake.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: Where’s the spare?</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: I.. .well.. .I’m not really certain.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: You do know how to change a tire.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Sorry. I’m not very… mechanical.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: Give me your keys.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: All right, where do you live?</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Close.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: It’s your lucky day. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>int. jillian’s car - driving</strong>: The car winds through
Westchester roads.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: Try room temperature, idiot. The Tokamak’s
got it all backwards.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Uhhm. Excuse me. Who is that?</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: Him? A powerful, well-respected man who
doesn’t know a goddarnn thing what he’s talking about. If I got one
tenth of his funding…</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: It’s the next left. First driveway on the
right.</p>
<p><strong>ext. westchester county - templar ’s home</strong>: Jillian’s
station wagon pulls into the circle of the largest mansion in
Westchester County. Just stupendous.</p>
<p><strong>int. jillian’s station wagon</strong>: Jillian stares,
open-mouthed, at the mansion.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: You live here? Are you for real?</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Like the label says. No chemicals, no
preservatives.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: You work for this or inherit it?</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: My father made shoes. I inherited the
company. Now I make shoes.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: That’s a helluva lot of shoes.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Uhm listen, I’m not very good at this and I
realize we just met, but I’m even-tempered, politically moderate, belong
to no religious cults, have no children I know of, am free of
communicable diseases, I happen to find you attractive…</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: Wait a minute, hold on. Are you asking me
out on a date?</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: How do you know I’m not married?</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: I believe the fourth finger on your left
hand is…</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: Okay so I’m not married. I could have a
boyfriend.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: I’d be surprised if you didn’t have
several.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: Be surprised. Lemme give you a hand.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: What about you? There’s no wife stashed on
some island someplace?</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: No wife stashed on some island.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: No mistress? C’mon. No bimbo on the
side?</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Not a one.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: Well, that’s a start. Here’s the deal with
me: I am not particularly even-tempered, I’m staunchly liberal, belong
to no religious cults but I do believe in God as a basic force of good,
have no children because one has to have sex to do that and, well, let’s
not pursue that, am free of communicable diseases, see above, and you’re
an attractive man, if a little weird, and well.. .hell, why not. You’ve
got a date, shoemaker. What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Michael. Michael Quinn.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: I’m Jillian St. Thomas.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: I’ll give you my number.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Just say it. I have a good memory.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: Eight seven seven, five two nine eight.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Good. Great. I’ll call you.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: I’ve heard that before.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: I will call you. You saved me today. Thanks
again.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: Hey. What’s my number?</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Eight seven seven, five two nine eight.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: And he has a brain. What do you know.</p>
<p><strong>int. westchester mansion - day</strong>: The place is empty.
Totally. No furniture. Nothing. Just Templar’s two CARRY-ON BAGS on the
floor in front of Templar.</p>
<p><strong>int. westchester mansion - living room - night</strong>: It’s
late now. About 10 p.m. Templar sits on a packing crate in the vacant
living room with a glass of scotch, studying Jillian’s life.</p>
<p><strong>int. manhattan - le cirque</strong>: – Jillian and Templar at
a corner table in Le Cirque. The meal is over. They’re drinking coffee,
laughing, at ease. The “date” is going well.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: I am not eccentric.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: No? You live in the biggest house in
America but do your own shopping, you talk to strange women about the
history of apples, and you give a first-time date.. . shoes? Isn’t the
tradition flowers?</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: You said you liked them.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: I do. I’m joking. They’re beautiful.
Thank-you.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: He just asked her to marry him. Anything
else?</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Just the check please. You didn’t answer my
question. Maybe it made you uncomfortable. Maybe I should just shut
up…</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: No, it’s all right. Okay: “Why Jillian
never got married, chapter One:” I don’t know where you’re from. . .</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Canada.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: I don’t know what it’s like there, but
here, if a teenage girl doesn’t want to be a cheerleader, or drink ’till
she pukes every weekend, or talk endlessly on the phone every night
about absolutely nothing, then she doesn’t win many popularity contests,
know what I mean? That pretty much took care of highschool.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: College?</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: Try earning double p.h.d.’s from Harvard
before you turn twenty-three and having a social life.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Can I ask a personal question? What’s your
I.Q.?</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: That’s personal? My I.Q.? Let’s just say
it’s high.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Very high.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: Yes, very high. As high as yours.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: You don’t honestly mean that.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: Oh, you’re a smart one, shoemaker. It’s in
the eyes. I can always tell.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: I just don’t often get the opportunity. It
feels nice.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: For me, too. You’re very pretty.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: Stop it. Flattery will get you… someplace.
I don’t know where yet.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: No no no, absolutely not. Put that
away.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: It’s not for us. It’s for the couple over
there. Waiter, put their bill on my card please.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Maam? Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>int. westchester county - jillian’s house - night</strong>:
Neat, modest, non-descript. Jillian and Templar enter. Jillian walks
across the living room into a bar alcove off the living room.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: I’ll make the booze. Turn on the news. I
want to catch up on that Russia thing.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Scotch please. No ice.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: What brand?</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: That country’s going to explode.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: It very well might. Oban.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: What? .</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: My brand of scotch. Oban. Have any?</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: No, but there’s a liquor store five minutes
away.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Wait. Don’t be ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: I want to be ridiculous. Michael, I haven’t
had anybody over in…a long time. And I happen to like you. I want to do
this right. Okay? I’ll be back in ten minutes. Build a fire.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: You’re making this too easy, dear.</p>
<p><strong>int. jillian’ shouse - back hallway</strong>: TEMPLAR moves
down the hall opening doors, looking for Jillian’s lab. He moves
quickly, ruthlessly.</p>
<p><strong>int. jillian’s house - basment</strong>: Templar finds a
lightswitch and flips it on. His eyes widen. Here we find –</p>
<p><strong>please wait</strong>: Then this appears: RETRIEVAL CODE:

<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Goodnight Jillian.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: �Night, Walter.</p>
<p><strong>int. jillian’s laboratory - night</strong>: Templar paces; he
looks at the homing device. The PULSING LIGHT is moving back toward
Jillian’s house. Templar looks at the computer; his system continues
entering words: “Hendrix.” ACCESS DENIED. “Purple Haze.” ACCESS DENIED.
“Red Sox.” ACCESS DENIED. “Celtics.” ACCESS DENIED. On and on…each is
met with</p>
<p><strong>int. jillian’s station wagon - driving - night</strong>:
Jillian, driving, turns on the radio. She hums along.</p>
<p><strong>int. jillian’s laboratory</strong>: Templar stares at the
HOMING DEVICE; the pulse is getting closer; it’s do or die now…
Templar’s system suddenly stops. It has run through every word. Each has
met with failure. TEMPLAR frowns. He yanks the system disk from the disk
drive. He begins pacing…</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Okay, think. Think.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: Try room temperature, idiot. The Tokamak’s
got it all backwards.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Open sesame.</p>

doorknob and enters –</p>
<p><strong>int. jillian’s house</strong>: She comes in. TEMPLAR,
relaxed, lounges on the couch, flipping through some magazines. He
smiles:</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: That was quick.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: Now Mr. Michael Quinn, let’s have that
scotch. Hey, what happened to the fire?</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: I thought we’d create our own.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: Down boy.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: Whoah whoah whoah, time to put on the
brakes. Those lips oughtta be licensed buddy…</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Sorry. I wasn’t trying to…</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: I know you weren’t but if we keep going I’m
gonna be the one who gets us both in trouble. Whew! Haven’t felt like
that for awhile. Am I going to see you again?</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: Michael?</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: How about breakfast?</p>

The Kremlin? No, Russia’s capital is…</p>
<p><strong>through those gates!</strong>: A den of thieves!</p>
<p><strong>michael romanov</strong>: And here - the Prince of
Thieves!</p>
<p><strong>michael romanov</strong>: Every citizen in St. Petersburg

him! How can this be? Maybe we should ask our elected whores in
Moscow!</p>
<p><strong>int. tretiak’ s headquarters - evening</strong>: Tretiak and

Zubov to a large bank of computers.</p>
<p><strong>zubov</strong>: This is the data your thief sent us.</p>
<p><strong>the generation of energy from cold nuclear fusion</strong>:
Submitted by:</p>
<p><strong>tretiak</strong>: Cold fusion?</p>
<p><strong>zubov</strong>: Yes. Fusion at room temperature. Regarded as
an impossibility by the scientific community. A myth. Then I read
this.</p>
<p><strong>zubov</strong>: She first proves why hot fusion - the tokamak
- is impractical. You must heat the hydrogen gases so high, more energy
is wasted than created. Here she goes into the benefits of cold fusion.
The hydrogen isotopes needed. The physical plant. She even estimates its
cost. Extraordinary. The next pages are the critical part, what no one
in fifty years has discovered. The combination of chemicals in which
atoms will fuse at room temperature.</p>
<p><strong>tretiak</strong>: Well? Let’s see.</p>
<p><strong>zubov</strong>: Tretiak - I think from reading this that the
woman’s done it. She may have found a source of unlimited energy.</p>
<p><strong>tretiak</strong>: What do you mean may have. Show me.</p>
<p><strong>zubov</strong>: I said there was a problem. Zubov hits the
“scroll” key. The next page appears; we see the heading at the top of
the page: THE CHEMICAL ENVIRONMENT FOR COLD FUSION</p>

with breakfast for two: eggs, bagels, etc. Sunlight streams in. Birds
chirping.</p>
<p><strong>int. jillian’s house - living room</strong>: She enters with
the basket. Looks at the disheveled couch and the bottle of Oban. She
hums the Cole Porter song, stabs her feet in THE SHOES TEMPLAR GAVE HER
and goes to the front door.</p>
<p><strong>ext. jillian’s house - front</strong>: Jillian comes out,
running into –</p>

pretty and well-dressed, comes out and locks the door.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: May I help you? Do you have an
appointment?</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: A what?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: To see the house.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: The man who lives here… who owns the
house…</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: What man. The estate is rented for weddings
and corporate events. Are you. ..interested…?</p>

<p><strong>int. jillian’s house - laboratory - morning</strong>: Jillian
races down the stairs and across the lab to her computer. She moves in a

<p><strong>int. jillian’s house - day</strong>: Templar enters. No one
is here. He moves through the living room into the back corridor,
glancing into the kitchen, where we see that –</p>
<p><strong>int. jillian’s house - kitchen - day</strong>: – SOMEONE is
behind the refrigerator, holding a SILENCED GUN in a blackgloved

staircase. The door is open. Templar heads down the stairs.</p>
<p><strong>int. jillian’s house - laboratory - day</strong>: Templar
comes down; he walks to the computer. He looks at the document on the

graphs, tables, plans, specs., etc. Then the critical page appears:</p>
<p><strong>the chemical environment for cold fusion</strong>: And under
that. . . .. A NINTENDO GAME. Little spaceships are flying around
chasing other little spaceships! TEMPLAR stares at it, stunned: what he
sent the Russians is essentially worthless. Templar shuts off the
monitor. The screen blackens. The black screen reflects light. It
reflects A PERSON coming down the stairs. A person with a gun…</p>

nine.</p>

boots, etc.</p>

plane.</p>

<p><strong>int. police sedan, driving - continuous - day</strong>:
Jillian sits in the back seat, catching her breath. The Young Cop looks
at her in the rear-view mirror.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: Do you speak English?</p>
<p><strong>young russian cop</strong>: Yes. Some.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: Thank God. I’m an American scientist. Last
night, in New York, a man stole something from me, then this morning I

. . .</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: What was that?</p>

<p><strong>young cop</strong>: Yes sir Sergeant Ravik.</p>
<p><strong>ext. at the foot of troitsky bridge - continuous</strong>:
TEMPLAR looks around. He sees A MOTORCYCLE STAND filled with
MOTORCYCLES. Runs to it. Chooses a big, powerful, Honda street machine.

running in seconds. He throws it in gear and ROARS off.</p>

Templar blasts through traffic on the Honda. He’s on a street parallel
to Jillian’s.</p>
<p><strong>ext. st. petersburg intersection - day</strong>: The police
cruiser moves through the intersection. Suddenly TEMPLAR’S MOTORCYCLE,
Templar-less, veers into the path of the cruiser. The cruiser hits it

The intersection is chaos: PEDESTRIANS running up, surrounding the
police cruiser, vehicles stopping, etc. Templar, virtually dragging
Jillian, plows through the crowd, passing a Russian Army Corporal who’s
just gotten out of his ARMY SUPPLY TRUCK.</p>
<p><strong>russian army corporal</strong>: Let me help!</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Help them!</p>
<p><strong>int. russian army supply truck - day</strong>: The driver’s
side door opens. In comes Jillian, then Templar. Templar shoves Jillian
across the front seat and gets in, behind the wheel. He floors it. They
accelerate into traffic. Templar looks at Jillian. She’s trembling,
staring catatonically straight ahead.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: Who are you. Tell me who you are and what
the hell is going on.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: I was hired to steal your research, but you
know that by now. You left the critical data off the disk. Where is it?
memorized, right? That’s a bad cut. Here.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Look, you’re in big trouble. The guy who
hired me will do anything to get your research. Once he has it, you’re a
corpse. Give me the missing data and I’ll get you out of here. You can
trust me.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: Trust you? Trust you…?</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Damn it, don’t be stupid…!</p>
<p><strong>ext. st. petersburg - streets</strong>: Templar gets out,

yards ahead. Moving through the crowded sidewalk toward the FONTANKA
.</p>
<p><strong>ext. lomonosova avenue - fontanka canal bridge -
sunset</strong>: Templar runs over the Fontanka Canal Bridge. Nothing.
He comes back the other way. Nothing. He stops in the middle of the
bridge, exhausted, out of breath. Below him, passing under the bridge,
all types of WATER CONVEYANCES are navigating the canal.</p>
<p><strong>ext. fontanka canal - embankment promenade - sunset</strong>:
Templar sprints down the sidewalk promenade next to the canal. The water
taxi is 50 yards past the bridge. JILLIAN sees him coming. TEMPLAR
closes the gap. 30 yards. 20 yards. Now 10. Now he’s running alongside
the taxi, staring at Jillian. And she stares back at him, stony,
expressionless. The canal is wider now, and the water taxi accelerates,
pulling away from the slower skiffs. Templar slows to a jog. He stops,
lungs heaving. The sun is setting to the west. The water taxi speeds off
into the setting sun, leaving Templar with this image of Jillian: eyes
unblinking, staring at him with pure, unadulterated hatred.</p>
<p><strong>ext. st. petersburg - nevsky prospect - night</strong>: Night

not-the only scientist working in this field. Is she?</p>
<p><strong>zubov</strong>: No. There are others.</p>
<p><strong>tretiak</strong>: Get on a plane. Leave tonight.</p>
<p><strong>zero</strong>: Gracha is here.</p>
<p><strong>gracha</strong>: This had better be important. It’s my wife’s
birthday.</p>
<p><strong>tretiak</strong>: My apologies to your wife.</p>
<p><strong>gracha</strong>: An apology from Tretiak? An historic
moment.</p>
<p><strong>tretiak</strong>: Come now, Ivan, why must we feud.</p>
<p><strong>gracha</strong>: We feud because we hate each other.</p>
<p><strong>tretiak</strong>: It is true there have been harsh words
between us. We are rivals. But rivalry is bad for business. Upon what
conditions would you accept a partnership? Be reasonable.</p>
<p><strong>gracha</strong>: Fifty percent of the drug trade in
St. Petersburg and Moscow. A third of prostitution and gambling.</p>
<p><strong>tretiak</strong>: Agreed. I need the men in your areas, Ivan,
for two days. Particularly Moscow and points South.</p>
<p><strong>gracha</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>tretiak</strong>: To find this woman… and kill this man.</p>
<p><strong>gracha</strong>: This is a private matter, I take it. Then
you’ll have them.</p>

concussive explosion.</p>
<p><strong>int. tretiak’ s offi ce</strong>: Gracha drops his wine
glass; it shatters on the floor. Gracha and his men unholster their
weapons. Tretiak’s men go for theirs. A tense stand-off.</p>

<p><strong>tretiak</strong>: Put your guns down.</p>
<p><strong>int. tretiak’s headquarters - night</strong>: The guards,
save one, barge out the front door. The remaining guard answers the
intercom, leaving FRANKIE unattended by the surveillance monitors. Her
hand moves to THE CO-AXIAL CABLE behind the video monitors, yanking it.
She plugs a TRANSMITTOR into the monitor, then replugs the co-axial
cable into the transmitter. The guard turns to Frankie.</p>
<p><strong>frankie</strong>: What was that?</p>

b.g. through a window, we see Tretiak’s headquarters looming down the

Tretiak’s surveillance cameras. We see exteriors, Zubov’s lab,
corridors, etc. Frankie is looking at A MONITOR OF TRETIAK’S OFFICE;
Tretiak is pacing, talking on the phone.</p>
<p><strong>frankie</strong>: They haven’t found her and they don’t know
where she is.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: She’s on a train to Moscow.</p>
<p><strong>frankie</strong>: That’s bad news. They’re ’stopping every

<p><strong>templar</strong>: Call you later, Frankie.</p>
<p><strong>ext. road south of st. petersburg - night</strong>: The

through the windshield.</p>
<p><strong>int. train to moscow - night</strong>: JILLIAN sits alone,

<p><strong>int. train to moscow - jillian’s car</strong>: JILLIAN sits
up in her seat; she looks through the connecting door into the next car,

Jillian lunge from the train onto the parallel tracks. A train whistle

right on top of them…</p>
<p><strong>int. train to moscow - day</strong>: TRETIAK’S MEN enter the

again. Templar and Jillian sit, regarding each other.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: You can’t get rid of me.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: Like a bad flu.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Pretty smart, selling the clothes and
watch. You were going for the U.S. embassy, weren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: Present tense please � I am going. Before
we discuss the present, let’s discuss the past.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: Who the hell are you. I want full name,
address, profession, and don’t - don’t - say Michael Quinn of 112 Mason
Street, shoemaker.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: My name is Simon Templar. I don’t have an
address because I live in hotels. I’m a professional thief.</p>

Indian gentleman peers out. He’s about 50, in a madras shirt and nehru
jacket. This is DR. VIJAY SINGH, whose taped lecture we heard in
Jillian’s station wagon.</p>
<p><strong>zubov</strong>: Dr. Singh? Dr. Vijay Singh?</p>

<p><strong>jillian</strong>: I think it is. C’mon. Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Fifteen million dollars, but it didn’t work
out. Did it.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: Does it bother you? What you do?</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: You have no conscience? No sense of
morality?</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Define morality.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: It’s a commonly used and generally
understood word.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Not by me. .</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Wait.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: You are not going in there with me.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: Okay, how about: Do unto others as they

unto you.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: How about: love thy neighbor.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: The man who said that was crucified by

<p><strong>jillian</strong>: What.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: The knife you just took.</p>

out.</p>
<p><strong>int. moscow - gorky station, main concourse -

concourse. A stupendous, vaulted interior. As impressive as Grand
Central in New York or Victoria in London. She moves through the crowd.
Eyes scanning everything and nothing. She bumps into A COMMUTER, who
scowls. Jillian takes cover by one of the immense marble pillars. She
pulls her collar up. Waits it out.</p>
<p><strong>blonde man</strong>: Ms. St. Thomas? Jillian?</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>whitehead</strong>: John Whitehead, Special Agent, Central

Embassy receives fifty calls a day. My husband’s been murdered, my
daughter’s been sold into white slavery, you get the idea. So before we

a Polish submarine. Who do you think intercepted the call?</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Thanks, Frankie.</p>
<p><strong>frankie</strong>: Simon, wait. . . .</p>

cadmium’s valence is 2, its atomic number is 48 and its atomic weight is

<p><strong>agent whitehead</strong>: Ms. St. Thomas? You had a
question?</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: Nothing, I was just thinking that when my
research was stolen I felt like the Buffalo Bills after they lost four
World Series.</p>

Whitehead and his men get out. They warily approach the sedan, drawing

around us. We don’t have much time.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: What are you going to do? Tell me. I
deserve at least that. I’ll die. If you take their offer, they’ll kill
me.</p>

Interesting situation I’d say.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: Oh god. It’s over, it’s all over… You’re
not human. You’re an animal.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: I’m a businessman. I perform services for
profit. And spare me the lecture. You didn’t spend ten years in that
mildewed basement for the good of humanity, you did it to get rich.
Richer than anyone on earth. Richer than God. I’ll make you an offer -
pay me my fifteen million out of your royalties - should come to about

<p><strong>jillian</strong>: I don’t hold the patent rights to cold
fusion.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: You fool. Don’t you understand? It wasn’t
about money, it wasn’t about becoming rich…</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: If you don’t own the patent rights, who
does?</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: A foundation in my name. The royalties were
going to go to scientific research, curing cancer, .. .christ how can
you understand this…</p>
<p><strong>ext. moscow - sidewalk</strong>: Several pedestrians walk by.
Templar walks Jillian quickly to a MANHOLE COVER. He kneels and hoists
the cover off. He points into the hole. Jillian, her wrists bound, steps
down uneasily, her feet finding the top rung of a STEEL LADDER. She
descends into the manhole. Templar follows.</p>
<p><strong>int. moscow - subterranean sewer system - day</strong>:
Jillian and Templar come down the ladder, dropping to the steel-gridded
walkway over the Moscow sewer. Templar pulls Jillian twenty feet down
the walkway. At this point in the wall there is a HATCH with a
compression HATCHWHEEL, the turning of which opens the hatch, like on a
submarine. Within the hatch we hear RUSHING WATER.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: That’s a municipal water main. In one hour
you’re going in there.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Listen. They shut it down twice a day for
five minutes to clean the filters. Once at noon, once at midnight. Noon
is in one hour.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: How do you know all this?</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Part of my job. Now ask the logical
question…</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: .. . where does it go?</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Very good. Under the United States Embassy.
There’s an exit hatch into the embassy courtyard. That’s where we’re
going.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: We…?</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: You heard me.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: Then what happens?</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Let’s get to the embassy, then we’ll talk
about it.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: Templar - about that night at my house�</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Don’t talk about it, okay?</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>ext. moscow - red square - continuous - day</strong>: The
Michael Romanov supporters are marching past the Kremlin with PLACARDS

<p><strong>ext. moscow - the united states embassy - day</strong>:
ROMANOV SUPPORTERS flood past the embassy gates, chased by Moscow
Policemen. Fights rage allover the street. A full-fledged riot is
breaking out. OVERTURNED CARS are burning. LOOTERS run through the
streets with stolen goods. We hear the sporadic CRACKLE of small arms
fire.</p>
<p><strong>in the u. s. embassy courtyard</strong>: A U. S. MARINE and
ARMY GREEN BERET detachment, grimfaced and heavily armed, stand silent
vigil inside the embassy’s wrought-iron gates. COLONEL WILLIAM CROSBY,
embassy c.o., exits the embassy and approaches the front gates. A FULL
BEER BOTTLE smashes at his feet, showering him.</p>
<p><strong>colonel crosby</strong>: Jesus H. Christ.</p>
<p><strong>across the street from the u. s. embassy</strong>: Ilya and
his men stand next to their vehicles, silently watching the embassy.</p>
<p><strong>int. moscow sewer system - day</strong>: The WHOOSHING water
in the municipal water main begins to subside. Templar looks at this
watch.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Right on time.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Four blocks. Right under Tretiak’s men and
up into the embassy compound. You can do this. She grabs Templar’s hand.
He pulls her up and inside –</p>
<p><strong>int. moscow - municipal water main - day</strong>: – a four
foot diamater pipe. Templar pulls out a PENLIGHT, switches it on and
sticks it between his teeth. On hands and kneess Templar and Jillian
move off through the water main.</p>
<p><strong>int. municipal water main - exit hatch under street</strong>:
Templar and Jillian crawl up. Templar shines his penlight at the
ceiling; AN EXIT HATCH WITH HATCHWHEEL is above them.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: It doesn’t seem like we’ve gone far
enough.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: We haven’t, up there’s the street in front
of the embassy. Come on. We’ve got two minutes.</p>
<p><strong>int. municipal water main under embassy</strong>: Templar and
Jillian crawl toward A SECOND EXIT HATCH.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: There it is.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: Oh my god…</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: We. …we’ve got to go back.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Not enough time. The hatch under the
street.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: What about Tretiak’s men �</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Better than drowning.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: The water’s back on!</p>
<p><strong>int. municipal water main - exit hatch under street</strong>:
Templar and Jillian reach the exit hatch under the street. Templar grips
the hatchwheel as –</p>
<p><strong>int. moscow - manhole below the street</strong>: - - and
SMASHES against A ONE FOOT DIAMETER PIPE running along the wall of the
service manhole, CRACKING a fissure in it. PRESSURIZED GAS blows out of
the pipe. TEMPLAR pulls himself up. He reaches down and pulls Jillian
up. Templar kicks the exit hatchdoor closed and spins the hatchwheel
shut. JILLIAN looks at the GAS spewing from the cracked pipe. She sniffs
the air. Templar looks at the pipe. A warning is printed in five
languages: GAS - DANGEROUS.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: City gas line.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: We can’t stay here, we’ll asphyxiate.</p>
<p><strong>ext. moscow - street in front of the u. s. embassy</strong>:
Templar slithers out. Pulls up Jillian. They’re under the van now. The
van’s rear door opens; TEN MEN jump down to the pavement. We see their
BLACK BOOTS; they are MOSCOW POLICE, arriving to arrest the looters.
Templar and Jillian crawl toward the van’s rear. Templar looks toward
THE U.S. EMBASSY. It’s 100 yards away, but looks like 100 miles.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Both of us will never make it. But one of
us can. Give me ten seconds, then break for the embassy and don’t stop
running until you’re at the gates. It’s a hundred yards, so move it.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: What are you going to…</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: That’s my business.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: Wait… .. .Simon. Don’t do this. They’ll
kill you.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: The world can do without Simon Templar. It
can’t do without you. See you around sometime.</p>
<p><strong>ilya</strong>: Kill him!</p>

breath.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Go. Faster.. . .</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: Open the gate!</p>
<p><strong>colonel crosby</strong>: Do it.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: I’m an American citizen.</p>
<p><strong>colonel crosby</strong>: You have our full protection ma’am.
Back away from the gate.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: Do something!</p>
<p><strong>colonel crosby</strong>: That’s Russian soil out there,
ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>ext. moscow international airport - day</strong>: Remy stands

stops. Zubov gets out, then Dr. Singh, dressed in a conservative Indian
suit, carrying a briefcase. Tretiak emerges from the mansion, greeting
Doctor Singh.</p>
<p><strong>int. tretiak’s headquarters - zubov’s lab - night</strong>:
Dr. Singh enters behind Tretiak and Zubov. They move to Zubov’s lab
table. Dr. Singh dons reading glasses. Zubov places Jillian’s research
before him. Singh flips a page, then another. He is awed. It’s like
Salieri looking at Mozart’s sheet music. He’s searched all his life for
something and… another person has found it.</p>
<p><strong>dr. singh</strong>: Yes. Yes. Yes, yes. . . . . I will give
you a list of the things I will need. I request solitude. Remove those
men. Leave me now. Please.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: No. No. No.</p>

<p><strong>jillian</strong>: I’m certain. It’s not him.</p>
<p><strong>ext. manhattan - central park - day</strong>: Jillian walks
down the tree-lined mall. Templar is standing there. She walks up to
him. A moment.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: They showed me photographs of criminals.
And a photograph of you.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: And…?</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: I said that the man in the photograph
doesn’t have the eyes of a criminal. The Washington symposium is
tomorrow afternoon. I’m going. I’m presenting my research to the
scientific community.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: What about your data…</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: It’s in my head. I’ll wing it.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: You need to conduct further research
anyway. I’ll help you.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: What are we researching. ..?</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: The benefits of warm fusion.</p>
<p><strong>int. jillian’s bedroom - night</strong>: There follows a love
scene. Afterward, in each other’s arms:</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: It is in the eyes. You’re not bad.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Being bad is the only thing I’ve ever been
good at.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: You can be good at being good. If you’re
afraid of the dark, remember the night rainbow. If tomorrow morning the
sky falls, have clouds for breakfast. If the birds forget their songs,
listen to the wind. And if between right and wrong, do what is
right.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Who said that?</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: My grandmother.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: How did I meet you. This saint. Saint
Thomas.</p>
<p><strong>int. tretiak’s headquarters - zubov’s lab - night</strong>:
Late at night. Dr. Singh is working feverishly. The desk is stacked with

isotope diagrams. He is adding chemicals to a bath of hydrogen in a
COMPRESSION CHAMBER.</p>
<p><strong>dr. singh</strong>: Zinc oxide. Iridium mercurate. Sodium
bicarbon nitrate. A cobalt magnesium isotope. Liquify the cobalt at 665
degrees fahrenheit, add the magnesium. …</p>

PHOTOGRAPHERS are taking Jillian’s picture as she moves through a crowd
outside the Smithsonian. She is formally dressed. TWO F.B.I. AGENTS walk
with her. It is raining. The place is a sea of umbrellas. Several
REPORTERS trail after her.</p>
<p><strong>reporter 1</strong>: Doctor St. Thomas! Ben Rothstein, Omni
Magazine. Is it true? Have you done it?</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: That question will be answered in ten
minutes, Mr. Rothstein.</p>
<p><strong>reporter 2</strong>: Marilyn Jones, Doctor St. Thomas.
Dr. Vijay Singh has said that your theories are insupportable…</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: Sorry, but I’m not interested in Doctor
Singh’s opinions on this or anything else.</p>
<p><strong>reporters</strong>: Ms. St. Thomas, Ms. St. Thomas…</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: Please, no more questions. …</p>

<p><strong>int. smithsonian institute - main hall - day</strong>: The
room is packed with scientists and reporters. Jillian mounts a podium in
front of the room.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: Good afternoon. In 1989, two physicists

<p><strong>ext. st. petersburg - dvortsovaya ploshchad - day</strong>:
The square is filled with thousands of MICHAEL ROMANOV SUPPORTERS.
They’re camped out now. A C.N.N. NEWS TEAM transmits from the
square.</p>
<p><strong>wolf blitzer</strong>: The scene is reminiscent of the
Tiananmen Square crisis, Bernard. The death toll stands at forty-eight
civilians and at least twenty-one armed forces personnel. Rumors
escalated today that…</p>
<p><strong>ext. st. petersburg - admiralty - establishing</strong>: A
LIMOUSINE pulls through a ’crowd of ROMANOV SUPPORTERS outside the
heavily guarded gates of the Admiralty, Russia’s Naval headquarters,
akin to Annapolis.</p>
<p><strong>wolf blitzer</strong>: .. . General Nicolai Radischev… …has
promised Michael Romanov his support, pending the outcome of today’s
meeting between Romanov and President Karpov.</p>
<p><strong>ext. admiralty - day</strong>: The limousine rolls through a
guarded checkpoint, stopping before –</p>
<p><strong>the admiralty’s nuclear situation facility</strong>: in a
more dangerous time, this is the place from which Russian military
leaders would conduct nuclear war. It’s an acre-sized field of concrete,
recessed 30 feet into the earth. It looks like a very large, very deep
swimming pool emptied of water. In the middle is a concave-shaped
entrance hatch . The two halves of the concave hatch open down the
middle, each side retracting into the facility. On the concrete floor
next to the hatch is a SMALL DETECTION UNIT. We’ll find about the unit
shortly…</p>
<p><strong>int. admiralty - nuclear operations - day</strong>: - - a
large room dominated by an ELECTRONIC MAP OF THE WORLD. Rows of computer
stations run the length of the room. It looks like a N.A.S.A. control
room. The Secret Servicemen lead Romanov across the room to –</p>
<p><strong>int. admiralty - nuclear operations office - day</strong>: An
office, relatively comfortable, with a computer, a television and
v.c.r., and a small satellite link. VICTOR KARPOV, the popularly elected
President of Russia, rises. Karpov is 55, intelligent, with a calm,
professional demeanor.</p>
<p><strong>romanov</strong>: A nuclear bunker, Mr. President? You must
worry for your safety.</p>
<p><strong>karpov</strong>: I have reason to.</p>
<p><strong>romanov</strong>: Yes. You do.</p>
<p><strong>karpov</strong>: You understand my policy on taping
meetings.</p>
<p><strong>karpov</strong>: I’ll get to the point. Your remarks are
irresponsible; they’ve caused civil unrest. Unless you appeal to your
supporters to stop rioting, I will institute martial law. Tell me what
you want.</p>
<p><strong>romanov</strong>: A public debate, then new elections. We’ll
let the people decide.</p>
<p><strong>karpov</strong>: Agreed.</p>
<p><strong>int. manhattan - lower east side bar - day</strong>: –
TEMPLAR, drunk at noon in a wretched little dive on Avenue A. His face
is drawn and pale. Haunted. Hasn’t slept or shaved for days. His
fingernails are dirty.</p>
<p><strong>int. tretiak’s office - day</strong>: Tretiak sits behind his
desk. The room is dark.</p>
<p><strong>tretiak</strong>: The woman’s death was unfortunate. You
lost. I lost. To think what we could have done with her formula. But
life goes on, no?</p>
<p><strong>tretiak</strong>: When Romanov gains the presidency Russia
will be ours. The possibilities are, you would agree, endless. You have
talent. Unique talent. I need that talent to break into an impregnable
facility. Be part of this, Templar.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Fifteen million, plus the fifteen you owe
me.</p>
<p><strong>tretiak</strong>: I owe you nothing. You were hired to steal
something and you failed.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Thirty million, and I use my own men.</p>
<p><strong>tretiak</strong>: Twenty million, and one of my men goes with
you.</p>
<p><strong>tretiak</strong>: Templar. A question. You had feelings for
the woman, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: I don’t have feelings, Tretiak.</p>
<p><strong>int. st. petersburg - hotel suite - office - day</strong>: A
hotel in the heart of the city. We hear sounds of demonstrations and
rioting in the street below. Templar sits at a table with Harry Winston,
Remy Samarkand, and Frankie. ARCHITECTURAL PLANS and PHOTOGRAPHS of the
Admiralty’s Nuclear Situation Facility are spread amongst room service
trays. ILYA, and the massive ZERO sit on the couch, listening. Ilya eyes
Templar. Templar periodically meets Ilya’s eyes. These exchanged glances
are rife with hostility. They’ve been at this a while and everyone’s
frustrated.</p>
<p><strong>frankie</strong>: No, no, no, Karpov’s office is in the
nuclear operations room. The entry hatch can’t be activated from above -
only below.</p>
<p><strong>remy</strong>: It’s lead-lined and reinforced with eight feet
of concrete. Explosives and drills are out.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Electronic by-pass?</p>
<p><strong>frankie</strong>: Negative. Understand something, Simon,
please: this is not a bank. This is the former Soviet Union’s missile
command. Forced entry is impossible.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>frankie</strong>: Uhhm.. .that is the facility’s… … radiation
detector. In the event of nuclear fall-out it automatically closes the
hatch.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: You’re saying the system can think.</p>
<p><strong>frankie</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Then it can be lied to.</p>
<p><strong>int. tretiak’s headquarters - zubov’s lab - day</strong>:
Romanov and Tretiak stand on one side of the lab. ACROSS THE LAB, ZUBOV
and DR. SINGH are huddled over a hydrogen tank, just like the one we saw
in Jillian’s lab. The tank is surrounded by hundreds of testtubes and
beakers containing chemicals.</p>
<p><strong>tretiak</strong>: The world will continue to spend half its
gross national product on oil.</p>
<p><strong>romanov</strong>: And Russia will spend none. Within five
years we will be the wealthiest nation on earth.</p>
<p><strong>tretiak</strong>: And it’s leaders, Romanov, the most
powerful people.</p>
<p><strong>ext. st. petersburg - admiralty - night</strong>: The
situation in the city has worsened. The ROMANOV SUPPORTERS outside the
admiralty now number several thousand. They carry pro-Romanov banners
and shout: DOWN WITH KARPOV! In the b.g., we see more rioting. Gunfire
crackling. An overturned truck.</p>
<p><strong>ext. admiralty - naval hospital</strong>: The ambulance pulls
up next to the emergency ward. The back door opens. Remy, dressed as a
PARAMEDIC, gets out. Remy and Harry haul out two heavily bandaged
RUSSIAN SOLDIERS on stretchers. The stretchers expand into rolling
gurneys. Harry and Remy roll the wounded soldiers inside.</p>
<p><strong>int. admiralty - naval hospital</strong>: Harry and Remy roll
the gurneys through the emergency ward. NAVAL DOCTORS and NURSES are
scrambling around, attending to WOUNDED SOLDIERS. The scene is frenetic.
The gurneys roll past the operating rooms, through double doors, into a
room. No one notices.</p>
<p><strong>int. admiralty - hospital storage room</strong>: A room
stocked with hospital supplies. The wounded “soldiers” spring off the
gurneys. They are TEMPLAR and ILYA. Ilya wears the uniform of a NAVAL
M.P. Templar wears a bulky, lead-lined anti-radiation suit. Templar
shoulders his backpack. Harry Winston stands on a counter, pushing up
the CEILING TILE. Templar and Ilya climb atop the counter. Harry forms a
stirrup with his hands and hoists Templar, then Ilya, through the hole
in the ceiling.</p>
<p><strong>int. admiralty - ventilation ducts - night</strong>: Templar
and Ilya crawl through the ventilation duct to a WIRE MESH</p>
<p><strong>opening.</strong>: Templar rips off the wire mesh screen.
Thirty feet below, in the recessed entrance to the nuclear situation
facility, TWO NAVAL GUARDS are walking their shift. They walk around the
corner. . .</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: We’ve got sixty seconds. Move.</p>
<p><strong>ext. admiralty - side of building</strong>: Templar crawls
out of the ventilation duct, his feet finding a windowsill. Just three
inches to stand on. Ilya crawls out, his feet finding the same
windowsill. The two men are side-by-side. They begin inching across the
sill to a STEEL-RUNGED ladder leading to the concrete floor below.
Ilya’s FOOT suddenly slips. His arms flail. He tries to keep his
balance, but fails. Templar catches Ilya’s wrist. A terrifying tableau:
Ilya, hanging over the concrete floor below, held up only by Templar. If
Templar let’s go, Ilya’s dead. They stare at each other…</p>
<p><strong>ext. admiralty - perimeter walls</strong>: The naval guards
walk their shift.</p>
<p><strong>ext. admiralty - nuclear situation facility - night</strong>:
Templar and Ilya hurry across the concrete floor to the entrance hatch.
Templar kneels next to the RADIATION DETECTOR, unshouldering his
backpack. Templar’s anti-radiation suit has a goggled hood, which he
dons. He then carefully lifts from his backpack a PLEXIGLASS RECTANGULAR
BOX the size and shape of a shoe box, and a high-powered cordless
BOLTDRIVER. The plexiglass box has two’ compartments, one empty, the
other filled with</p>
<p><strong>smoky gas.</strong>: Templar positions the plexiglass box
over the radiation detector. He unpockets FOUR CONCRETE BOLTS CREWS and
bolts the box tightly to the concrete floor with the cordless
boltdriver.</p>
<p><strong>ext. admiralty - perimeter walls</strong>: The naval guards
reach the end of the perimeter wall, then turn back toward the nuclear
situation facility…</p>
<p><strong>ext. admiralty - nuclear situation facility - night</strong>:
Templar turns a knob on the plexiglass box; THE DOOR separating the two
compartments within the box OPENS. Inside, THE SMOKY GAS releases. It
wafts into the radiation detector’s sensors.. ..Templar watches
anxiously, talking to it…</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Radon isn’t plutonium but you don’t know
that…</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Boom, you just got nuked. Now it’s two
months later and the radiation’s gone…</p>
<p><strong>ext. admiralty - perimeter walls</strong>: The naval guards
are nearing the rear of the Admiralty. Around the corner is the nuclear
situation facility…</p>
<p><strong>int. admiralty - nuclear situation room - day</strong>:

open/close switch. Templar throws the “close” switch. Above, the hatch
doors start to close..</p>
<p><strong>ext. admiralty - perimeter walls</strong>: The naval guards
come around the corner just as…</p>
<p><strong>int. admiralty - nuclear situation room - day</strong>:
Templar and Ilya move through the nuclear situation room to President
Karpov’s office.</p>
<p><strong>int. admiralty - nuclear operations office - day</strong>:
Ilya and Templar enter. Ilya opens the credenza behind Karpov’s desk,
revealing ROWS OF VIDEOTAPE CASSETTES. Ilya rifles through the tapes.
Templar kneels behind the T.V. and V.C.R. He switches the T.V.’s
satellite link from “RECEIVE” to “TRANSMIT,” and adjusts the satellite
frequency. Ilya hands Templar a VIDEO CASSETTE TAPE. Templar throws it
in the V.C.R. and hits a button. The V.C.R. transmits the tape over the
satellite link to the - -</p>
<p><strong>ext. admiralty roof</strong>: – Satellite DISH on the
Admiralty’s roof, which sends the transmission into outer space, where
it bounces off a satellite and returns to –</p>
<p><strong>int. st. petersburg - hotel suite - night</strong>: – a
V.C.R. in the hotel suite, where Frankie hovers over an array of
sophisticated editing equipment. Tretiak, Romanov, and several of
Tretiak’s men stand to the side. Templar’s transmission plays on a T.V.
It’s a tape of the Karpov/Romanov meeting:</p>
<p><strong>karpov</strong>: Tell me what you want.</p>
<p><strong>romanov</strong>: A public debate, then new elections. We’ll
let the people decide.</p>
<p><strong>karpov</strong>: Agreed.</p>
<p><strong>tretiak</strong>: Upon what conditions would you accept a

<p><strong>gracha</strong>: Fifty percent of the drug trade in
St. Petersburg and Moscow. A third of prostitution and gambling.</p>
<p><strong>int. admiralty - nuclear situations facility -

watch.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Come on, Frankie…</p>
<p><strong>int. st. petersburg - hotel suite - night</strong>: Frankie,
finished, hits “play.” We see an altered version of the Karpov/Romanov
meeting. Romanov has been morphed out and Ivan Gracha bas been morphed
in. ON THE SCREEN, it now looks like this:</p>
<p><strong>president karpov</strong>: Tell me what you want.</p>
<p><strong>gracha</strong>: Fifty percent of the drug trade in
St. Petersburg and Moscow. A third of prostitution and gambling.</p>
<p><strong>president karpov</strong>: Agreed.</p>

<p><strong>int. admiralty - nuclear operations office</strong>: Templar
looks at his watch. He’s waiting for Frankie to send back the morphed
tape…</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Come on, Frankie.</p>
<p><strong>int. admiralty - operations room - night</strong>: The
Special Forces Men come down the stairs and across the room toward
Karpov’s office…</p>
<p><strong>int. admiralty - nuclear bunker - karpov’s office</strong>:
Templar yanks the MORPHED TAPE from the v.c.r and goes back to Karpov’s
credenza. He kneels by the drawer. Something fast and unexpected
happens, like slight-of hand. Templar pulls A SECOND TAPE from inside
his suit and puts it back in the drawer, sliding the morphed tape under
the credenza. He stands, turns, and freezes…</p>
<p><strong>ilya</strong>: I found him over there. With this.</p>
<p><strong>special forces major</strong>: Give it to me. Arrest
President Karpov.</p>
<p><strong>int. admiralty - night</strong>: President Karpov and his
wife are sleeping. The door blasts open, throwing a beam of light on
Karpov, who sits up, staring with a confused expression at –</p>
<p><strong>romanov</strong>: Friends, countrymen, I give you Major
Antonin Scarpinin.</p>
<p><strong>major scarpinin</strong>: Twenty minutes ago a team of
Russian Special Forces, acting on confidential information, raided
President Karpov’s office…</p>
<p><strong>tretiak</strong>: Thank you for coming, Ivan, it is a great
night for Russia.</p>
<p><strong>ivan gracha</strong>: I don’t give a damn who’s president.
I’ll make my money either way.</p>
<p><strong>tretiak</strong>: Maybe you should take greater interest in
politics, Ivan Gracha. Tretiak and Gracha turn to Major Scarpinin,
listening…</p>
<p><strong>major scarpinin</strong>: This man, a known international
thief, aided by this woman, a German operative, were arrested stealing a
surveillance videotape from President Karpov’s office. Scarpinin shows
THE SEIZED TAPE to the crowd, then hands it to Romanov, who climbs atop
the tank. TEMPLAR AND FRANKIE are pulled down from the turret and led
away to TWO ARMY TRUCKS in the background.</p>
<p><strong>romanov</strong>: One month ago I said I would prove that
those who call themselves our leaders… .. .are in league with those who
we know to be thieves, traitors, rapists of our once-great country. Do
you want to see this proof?</p>
<p><strong>tretiak</strong>: Hail Michael Romanov, Czar of the
Fatherland. How will that sound to the average Russian?</p>
<p><strong>romanov</strong>: The average Russian is a fool.</p>
<p><strong>romanov</strong>: He exists to be dominated. To partnership
in government.</p>
<p><strong>tretiak</strong>: No Romanov � to partnership in crime.</p>
<p><strong>romanov</strong>: That.. . that it is a fraud… I can
explain.</p>
<p><strong>radischev</strong>: Arrest him.</p>
<p><strong>across the square - at the army trucks</strong>: Panic and
pandemonium. Soldiers running here and there amidst panicked civilians.
A SPECIAL FORCES SERGEANT stands guard outside one of the trucks. A

Winston and Remy, of course.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: Get Frankie.</p>

<p><strong>tretiak</strong>: Get the plane running, we’ll be there in
five minutes. Clean out the safe. Burn the records in my office.</p>
<p><strong>int. tretiak’ s headquarters - zubov’ s lab</strong>: A T.V.
shows a newscast from the Ploschad. Dr. Singh and Zubov, having seen
everything that just transpired, are frantically destroying their data
and records. Zubov is burning the cold fusion hardcopies in a waste
basket. Dr. Singh is deleting the computer files. Tretiak and Ilya come
down the stairs. Zubov pops a 3 1/4 disk from the computer.</p>
<p><strong>zubov</strong>: We reduced the fusion formula to one disk and
destroyed everything else.</p>
<p><strong>tretiak</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>dr. singh</strong>: What.. . what are you…?</p>
<p><strong>ilya</strong>: We can share this, Templar.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: We don’t own it.</p>
<p><strong>ilya</strong>: Who does?</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: The Jillian St. Thomas Foundation.</p>
<p><strong>ilya</strong>: Don’t be a fool.</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: I’m a fool? You thought you could get away
with murder. Used curare didn’t you? Induces blood-clotting.</p>
<p><strong>ilya</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>templar</strong>: What do I want? I want.. . revenge. Now
give me the disk.</p>
<p><strong>int. tretiak’ s headquarters - night</strong>: Ilya emerges
from the basement stairwell and races for the front door. Templar comes
up; sprints after Ilya.</p>
<p><strong>int. tretiak’s mansion - zubov’s lab - night</strong>: The
lab is rocked by the explosions. RACKS OF CHEMICALS in beakers fall to
the floor, SMASHING. The chemicals begin to ooze together. A chemical
reaction is occurring. The mixing chemicals begin emitting smoke.</p>
<p><strong>int. tretiak’s mansion - corridor/tretiak’s office</strong>:
Tretiak’s men are at the windows with automatic weapons, firing on the
army below. Two men drag a crate into the office. They open it,
revealing an �</p>
<p><strong>on the staircase - templar and ilya</strong>: continue up the
staircase. Ilya reaches the mezzanine. He climbs atop the balustrade and
jumps to the lip of the crater in the dome. He pulls himself up. Templar
repeats Ilya’s actions: climbs atop the balustrade and jumps to the lip
of the crater. As he pulls himself up… ILYA appears. He compresses his
foot against Templar’s knuckles. Templar grimaces. There’s no way out
this time. There’s a burst of ORANGE LIGHT as A TANK SHELL explodes on
the roof, knocking Ilya off his feet, allowing –</p>
<p><strong>ext. tretiak’ s headquarters / nevsky prospect -
night</strong>: The tanks continue firing. Russian Marines fire round
after round into the mansion. Tretiak’s men inside return the fire.

firefight. Realizing Templar is within…</p>

launcher is operational. One of Tretiak’s men loads, the other fires,
and –</p>
<p><strong>ext. tretiak’s mansion - night</strong>: – an ANTI-TANK SHELL
launches from the window and hits the tank in the courtyard, blowing its
turret off. Tretiak’s men fire assault rifles from the windows. No one’s
surrendering. It’s a fight to the death…</p>
<p><strong>ext. tretiak’s mansion - roof - night</strong>: Templar and
Ilya, on the mansion’s roof. The view is mind-boggling: the nighttime
St. Petersburg skyline looming in the background and, below, three
Russian tanks firing shell after shell into the mansion. Across the
exploding, crumbling rooftop, Ilya and Templar go. A TANK SHELL explodes
in front of Ilya. Ilya falls, concussed by the shell. Templar dives upon
him, wrenching the COMPUTER DISK from Ilya’s pocket. Ilya slams his
forearm into Templar’s head. The disk flies from Templar’s hand,
scuttles across the roof shingles, falling through a crater…</p>
<p><strong>int. tretiak’s mansion - zubov’s lab - night</strong>:
Another whole shelf of chemicals falls, smashing. The chemicals continue
to mix…</p>
<p><strong>ext. tretiak’s headquarters - roof</strong>: Templar dangles
from the drainpipe. KA-CHUNG. It gives. It gives again. The drainpipe is
about to break. Templar looks down into the flames and demolition
below…</p>

chemicals are steaming now, in a froth, becoming more and more and more
volatile…</p>

from the drainpipe, looks wildly around for an escape. If he could just
get to that adjacent building…</p>
<p><strong>int. tretiak’ s mans ion - staircase - night</strong>: Ilya’s
eyes bulge in terror as the staircase collapses under him. Ilya falls,
engulfed in flame, still clutching the cold fusion disk.</p>
<p><strong>ext. tretiak’s mansion - night</strong>: The drainpipe fully
detaches from the collapsing mansion wall. It falls away from the
mansion, with Templar still holding on…</p>
