<p><strong>the addams family</strong>: by</p>
<p><strong>shooting script</strong>: April 11, 1991</p>
<p><strong>a1 ext. addams mansion front steps - christmas eve
a1</strong>: A GROUP OF CAROLERS, their eager faces upturned, SINGS an
endless and cloying roundelay of “Little Drummer Boy.” They sing with
self-righteous good cheer. As they pompously begin their umpteenth
verse, THE CAMERA SLOWLY PANS UP THE ADDAMS MANSION – past the black
wreath on the front door, past broken windows, weather-beaten shingles,
a creaking shutter.</p>
<p><strong>the camera continues to pan to the roof</strong>: where the
Addams Family members, GOMEZ, MORTICIA, GRANNY, PUGSLEY, WEDNESDAY, and
LURCH, their faithful butler, gleefully POUR a CAULDRON OF BUBBLING,
STEAMING PITCH over the edge.</p>
<p><strong>c.u. an over-sized “cuckoo” clock –</strong>: The clock is a
perfect REPLICA OF THE ADDAMS FAMILY HOUSE, down to the creaking
shutter. It chimes the hour. In ONE WINDOW, a LITTLE MECHANICAL GOMEZ
bends a MECHANICAL MORTICIA back until she’s almost off her feet and
plants a kiss between her clockwork decolletage. One, two, three
mechanical kisses, counting toward seven o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>low tracking shot</strong>: follows Thing along the
hallway.</p>
<p><strong>1 continued: 1</strong>: He runs past a couple of doors, past
a pair of LEGS in pajamas, feet in bedroom slippers. He skids to a halt
and BACK TRACKS to the legs. He pulls on the cuff of the pajama bottoms.
They belong to GOMEZ, who stands in the doorway to</p>
<p><strong>a2 int. fester’s room a2</strong>: Gomez wears a fez and a
smoking jacket over his pajamas. Even at this early hour, he puffs on
his trademark cigar. Gomez is all enthusiasm or all despair. At the
moment, he radiates unfathomable woe.</p>
<p><strong>gomez</strong>: Think of it, Thing. He’s been gone for
twenty-five years. For twenty- five years we’ve attempted to contact
Fester in the great beyond…</p>
<p><strong>gomez</strong>: … And for twenty-five years, nothing. Not a
whisper, not a clue. I’m beginning to think my my brother truly is
lost.</p>
<p><strong>b2 int. hallway - same time b2</strong>: Galloping ahead of
Gomez, Thing leaps onto an old-fashioned door latch and the door swings
open INTO</p>
<p><strong>2 int. gomez and morticia’s bedroom - same time 2</strong>:
Gomez approaches the bed. Asleep on scarlet satin sheets is…</p>
<p><strong>gomez</strong>: Look at her – I would die for her. I would
kill for her. Either way – what bliss.</p>
<p><strong>gomez</strong>: Unhappy, darling?</p>
<p><strong>morticia</strong>: Oh, yes, yes. Completely.</p>
<p><strong>3 int. pugsley’s room - same time 3</strong>: Pugsley
crouches on the floor, playing with his kid-sized chemistry set. The
walls of his room are covered with road signs he’s collected – “Bridge
Out!”, “Detour! Excavation Ahead!”, “Dangerous Undertow!”, “Keep Clear!
High Voltage!” SAWED-OFF STOP SIGNS, still on their poles, are stacked
in the corner.</p>
<p><strong>fish tank, filled with piranha.</strong>: This tubby
energetic monster of a nine-year-old boy has every chance of growing up
to be the public monster his parents would be proud of. He MIXES
chemicals in a beaker. The brew steams. Grin- ning wickedly, Pugsley
SWALLOWS it down. He contorts, undergoing the beginnings of a
transforma- tion, then SHRINKS to the size of a mouse. Laughing, he
crawls out of his human-size pajamas.</p>
<p><strong>a5 int. attic - same time a5</strong>: Solemn and mournful,
ten-year-old Wednesday has black hair and white skin like her mother.
She sits on a stool among the stored Addams’ family objects, ONE END OF
A</p>
<p><strong>string tied to her tooth, the other tied to a trap
door.</strong>: The trap door is flung open, GRANNY pokes her head
through. She’s a giggly hag who looks like she was in the bathtub when
the hairdryer fell in. Wednesday’s pulled tooth swings at the end of the
string.</p>
<p><strong>wednesday</strong>: Thank you, Grandmama.</p>
<p><strong>granny</strong>: You kids are going to have to kill your own
breakfast this morning.</p>
<p><strong>a6 int. gomez and morticia’s bedroom - same time a6</strong>:
Gomez takes Morticia in his arms. As she languidly drapes herself across
his chest, she is caught in a sudden shaft of sunlight. She squints. On
the bedside table beside her, Morticia’s OVERSIZED CARNIVOROUS</p>
<p><strong>morticia</strong>: Gomez… the sun… il me perce comme un
poignard.</p>
<p><strong>gomez</strong>: Tish… that’s French!</p>
<p><strong>morticia</strong>: Oui.</p>
<p><strong>gomez</strong>: Cara mia!</p>
<p><strong>a6 continued: a6</strong>: He kisses his way up to her neck,
then, suddenly bursting with enthusiasm and a sense of purpose, LEAPS
from the bed, drawing his bedside saber from its sheath and BRANDISHING
it at the offending beam.</p>
<p><strong>gomez</strong>: En garde monsieur sole!</p>
<p><strong>morticia</strong>: Gomez?</p>
<p><strong>gomez</strong>: Querida?</p>
<p><strong>morticia</strong>: Last night, you were… unhinged. You were
like some desperate, howling demon. You frightened me. Do it again.</p>
<p><strong>6 ext. rooftop - same time 6</strong>: Granny delivers a
swift kick to her fog machine.</p>
<p><strong>granny</strong>: Lousy bucket of bolts…!</p>
<p><strong>7 int./ext. morticia and gomez’s bedroom - same time
7</strong>: At the window, Gomez pokes his head out. In the background,
Morticia brushes her hair with a silver filigree brush.</p>
<p><strong>gomez</strong>: Granny - where’s your fog?</p>
<p><strong>from above</strong>: the fog machine hurtles downwards,
missing decapitating Gomez by millimeters. It crashes below, smashing
through the front porch roof.</p>
<p><strong>9 int. entrance hall - later 9</strong>: Standing beside the
front door is LURCH, the gigantic family butler, a reanimated
stitched-together behemoth. He holds two brown paper lunch bags in his
enormous hands. The bags’ contents wriggle, eager to escape.</p>
<p><strong>wednesday</strong>: Thank you, Lurch.</p>
<p><strong>9 continued: 9</strong>: Pugsley takes his bag, opens it, and
peers inside. Lurch GROWLS, and Pugsley closes the bag.</p>
<p><strong>same time</strong>: Gomez is HITTING GOLF BALLS – Thing
serving as his tee – while Morticia sips tea.</p>
<p><strong>11 one of the golf balls 11</strong>: flies with incredible
speed</p>
<p><strong>12 int. neighbor’s home - same time 12</strong>: JUDGE
WOMACK, the Addams’ CRUSTY PATRICIAN NEIGHBOR, is having his breakfast
when Gomez’s golf ball lands in his cornflakes, shattering the bowl,
covering him with milk. Judge Womack hurries to his broken window,
shaking his fist:</p>
<p><strong>judge womack</strong>: Damn you, Addams!</p>
<p><strong>from their vantage point –</strong>: it appears to Gomez and
Morticia that Judge Womack is waving to them. Gomez waves back.</p>
<p><strong>gomez</strong>: Sorry about the window, Judge! Keep the ball!
I have a whole bucketful.</p>
<p><strong>13 continued: 13</strong>: Gomez joins Morticia watching</p>
<p><strong>morticia</strong>: The little ones, off to school. Bless
them.</p>
<p><strong>gomez</strong>: They grow up so fast, don’t they?</p>
<p><strong>morticia</strong>: Too fast.</p>
<p><strong>b14 int. the conservatory - later that morning b14</strong>:
Morticia, wearing gardening gloves, is snipping the blossoms off her
roses. Gomez sits at a table, playing CHESS with Thing.</p>
<p><strong>gomez</strong>: It’s a milestone, Tish. This very evening –
our twenty-fifth seance. All those years, gnawed by guilt, undone by
woe, burning with uncertainty…</p>
<p><strong>morticia</strong>: Oh Gomez, don’t torture yourself. That’s
my job.</p>
<p><strong>gomez</strong>: Tish…</p>
<p><strong>morticia</strong>: Imagine, Darling, if Fester did come back.
Half-alive, barely human, a rotting shell…</p>
<p><strong>gomez</strong>: Don’t tease.</p>
<p><strong>14 ext. just outside the addams’ grounds - same time
14</strong>: TULLY ALFORD, the family attorney, and his wife, MARGARET,
approach “GATE,” a wrought-iron monstrosity that opens of its own
accord. Though Tully comes here often and Margaret has been here before,
they never cease to be startled by “Gate.” Tully has a puffy, once
handsome face, and an embittered grey aura that is the mark of a
middle-age misspent. High-strung and superficial, Margaret is more
disap- pointed in Tully than he is in himself. Margaret passes through
Gate first. Then, as Tully passes through, Gate slams on him, clipping
him and catching the end of his coat. Tully fights Gate for his
coat.</p>
<p><strong>tully</strong>: Let me go!</p>
<p><strong>tully</strong>: Gimme that! Stop it! I’m warning you! It’s
not a good day!</p>
<p><strong>a15 int. conservatory - same time a15</strong>: Gomez moves a
chess piece. Thing gestures out the window. Gomez and Morticia both look
out. As they do, Thing moves two chess pieces, cheating.</p>
<p><strong>morticia</strong>: Tully is here, darling.</p>
<p><strong>gomez</strong>: Please, Gordon, by all means - go.</p>
<p><strong>fester</strong>: Mother, I’m… I’m so terribly sorry… It was
just a party. It’s over. It means nothing. Those Siamese twins, that
hunchback, Cousin It - they’re not you.</p>
<p><strong>abigail</strong>: Say it, Gordon. Make me believe it.</p>
<p><strong>fester</strong>: I love you. And I want money.</p>
<p><strong>abigail</strong>: We’ve got to find Tully.</p>
<p><strong>114 int. ballroom - same time 114</strong>: Morticia is
looking for her children. She discovers Pugsley ASLEEP, curled up on the
SILVER PLATTER WHERE THE TWO-HEADED PIG LAY. She finds this enchanting.
Gomez enters. Morticia shushes him; she points to the platter.</p>
<p><strong>morticia</strong>: Look - our little boy.</p>
<p><strong>gomez</strong>: All tuckered out.</p>
<p><strong>morticia</strong>: So sweet. He looks just… like a little
entree.</p>
<p><strong>pugsley</strong>: Where… where’s the party?</p>
<p><strong>morticia</strong>: It’s over, darling - have you seen your
sister?</p>
<p><strong>pugsley</strong>: Not since before the Mamushka.</p>
<p><strong>morticia</strong>: Gomez?</p>
<p><strong>gomez</strong>: Don’t fret - we’ll find her.</p>
<p><strong>115 ext. addams yard - later 115</strong>: Gomez rallies the
family for the search. Morticia wears a black cloak. Granny has grabbed
her divining rod. Lurch distributes torches, then stands aside, awaiting
instructions. Pugsley helps Gomez unroll an ancient map of the area.</p>
<p><strong>gomez</strong>: Fan out. Pugsley - head for the dung heap.
Mama and Morticia - the shallow graves. I’ll take the abyss, and Lurch -
check the bottomless pit.</p>
<p><strong>morticia</strong>: Her favorite…</p>
<p><strong>gomez</strong>: Fester!!</p>
<p><strong>fester</strong>: Up here.</p>
<p><strong>gomez</strong>: Fester! You take the ravine! And the
unmarked, abandoned well!</p>
<p><strong>fester</strong>: Somebody should stay behind - in case she
comes back.</p>
<p><strong>gomez</strong>: Good man! Good thinking!</p>
<p><strong>granny</strong>: Then who’ll take the swamp?</p>
<p><strong>gomez</strong>: That’s the spirit, Thing - lend a hand! Let’s
go!</p>
<p><strong>116 int. wednesday’s room - a short while later 116</strong>:
Fester is still at the window. Abigail joins him.</p>
<p><strong>their pov</strong>: Spread far and wide over the grounds, the
various members of the family search for Wednesday, tiny lights aloft,
calling.</p>
<p><strong>abigail</strong>: Where the hell is Tully?</p>
<p><strong>118 int. den - a little later 118</strong>: Fester and
Virginia find…</p>
<p><strong>abigail</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>tully</strong>: Relaxing. Taking a little sun.</p>
<p><strong>abigail</strong>: Have you gone mad?</p>
<p><strong>tully</strong>: Au contraire.</p>
<p><strong>119 ext. swamp - middle of the night 119</strong>: Thing hops
lily pads, stopping occasionally to quest the air for his mistress.</p>
<p><strong>the night</strong>: Torch aloft, Pugsley searches through the
primeval forest.</p>
<p><strong>121 ext. neighborhood - middle of the night 121</strong>:
Lurch picks up a car – looking for Wednesday.</p>
<p><strong>122 ext. underground grotto - middle of the night
122</strong>: Morticia and Granny stand in the middle of the dripping
dankness. Stalagmites. Stalactites. Granny’s torch casts scary shadows
on the cave walls.</p>
<p><strong>granny</strong>: Wednesday! Wednesday!</p>
<p><strong>morticia</strong>: Oh, Mama, I was sure we’d find her
here.</p>
<p><strong>a124 int. mausoleum - same time a124</strong>: Inside it is
catacomb-like, filled with the bleached bones of the Addams dead.
Gomez’s torch casts shadows – one of which belongs to Wednesday, curled
asleep on a stone sarcophagus. Relieved to find her, Gomez approaches
quietly. He doesn’t want to wake her up. He lifts her tenderly in his
arms.</p>
<p><strong>124 ext. gate - darkness before dawn 124</strong>: Gate can’t
open. He rattles miserably on his hinges – locked tight with heavy
chains and yellow police tape - large “NO TRESPASSING!! COURT ORDER!!
ADDAMS FAMILY - KEEP OUT!!” signs are posted on Gate’s rusty bars.</p>
<p><strong>pull back to reveal –</strong>: the family, appalled at the
sight of Gate. Lurch carries the sleeping Wednesday and Pugsley.</p>
<p><strong>gomez</strong>: What’s all this?</p>
<p><strong>tully</strong>: This is a restraining order, Gomez.</p>
<p><strong>gomez</strong>: A restraining order?</p>
<p><strong>tully</strong>: It requires you to keep a distance of one
thousand yards from this house. You’ve got about nine hundred and
ninety-nine yards to go - catch my drift?</p>
<p><strong>gomez</strong>: I am restrained - from my own house!?</p>
<p><strong>tully</strong>: Not your house, moustache! Not any more! It
belongs to the eldest living descendant, the older of the brothers –
Fester Addams!</p>
<p><strong>gomez</strong>: But - this is lunacy!</p>
<p><strong>morticia</strong>: Fester adores Gomez!</p>
<p><strong>tully</strong>: He’s afraid of him. Seeing the twins brought
it all back. You’re bitter rivals, Gomez - always were, always will
be!</p>
<p><strong>gomez</strong>: It’s not so! Those girls meant nothing - he
knows that! I demand to see Fester!</p>
<p><strong>tully</strong>: Sorry - no can do. He’s very hurt - it’s not
a good time. Leave it alone. Or better yet - just leave.</p>
<p><strong>124 continued: 124</strong>: Wednesday comes forward, rubbing
the sleep from her eyes.</p>
<p><strong>wednesday</strong>: But he isn’t even Uncle Fester.</p>
<p><strong>gomez</strong>: Do not fear - justic shall prevail. The
courts will decide! They say a man who represents himself has a fool for
a client. Well, with God as my witness - I am that fool!</p>
<p><strong>c.u. gavel –</strong>: hammers on the Judge’s bench. PULL
BACK to reveal –</p>
<p><strong>judge womack</strong>: is the presiding judge. He hammers the
bench again, then reads his decision.</p>
<p><strong>judge womack</strong>: Given applicable standards of proof,
the attempts to impugn this man’s character or question his identity
have been woefully inadequate. It is with no small amount of personal
satisfaction that I declare Fester Addams legal executor of the Addams
estate and rightful owner of all properties and possessions contained
herein. Gomez Addams… I believe this is yours.</p>
<p><strong>127 ext. addams mansion - day 127</strong>: The family
members TROOP to the car with their few possessions.</p>
<p><strong>gomez</strong>: already sits in the passenger seat of the
Duesenberg, his coat draped over his shoulders as if he were an invalid,
his head thrown back. Morticia carries out Cleo, her carnivorous plant.
Granny carries her favorite cauldron, Wednesday one of her Marie
Antoinette dolls, Pugsley his chemistry set. Lurch uproots his favorite
tree and joins the procession. Thing follows, dragging a toy wagon
packed with his rings, his glove.</p>
<p><strong>129 ext. addams overgrown driveway - later 129</strong>: The
Duesenberg eases out of the driveway and onto the street, WEIGHED DOWN
by Lurch’s tree, sticking out of the trunk.</p>
<p><strong>fester</strong>: standing at a second story window, watches
the car drive off.</p>
<p><strong>130 ext. wampum court - later. 130</strong>: A two-story NEON
ARROW points the way to this bungalow court – Bright and awful ersatz
western. LOG CABINS OF SIMULATED WOOD surround the TEEPEE-SHAPED OFFICE.
The Addams’ Duesenberg is parked in front of the furthest cabin. The
asphalt has been ripped up in big chunks and Lurch’s tree is parked next
to the Addams’ new home.</p>
<p><strong>c.u. dressing table mirror</strong>: Morticia leans into
frame. With an icepick and a hammer, she deftly makes a large spidery
CRACK in the round mirror. Sighing deeply, she stands back to admire her
handiwork. Granny joins her.</p>
<p><strong>granny</strong>: I like it.</p>
<p><strong>morticia</strong>: Just as long as we’re together, n’est pas,
mon cher?</p>
<p><strong>gomez</strong>: sits slumped in a chair made from wagon wheel
and nauga- hyde. It’s as if all of his insane, vibrant energy has been
leeched from him. He’s a broken man. He looks back at her as if he’s
never heard French.</p>
<p><strong>gomez</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>pugsley</strong>: comes from the bathroom, nibbling a wrapped
bar of motel soap.</p>
<p><strong>pugsley</strong>: This place isn’t so bad. They even put
candy in the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>morticia</strong>: That’s the soap, dear.</p>
<p><strong>pugsley</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>wednesday</strong>: Do you want a cigar, Father?</p>
<p><strong>gomez</strong>: They’re very bad for you.</p>
<p><strong>wednesday</strong>: Father?</p>
<p><strong>gomez</strong>: But maybe I’ll have one of those…</p>
<p><strong>132a int. addams mansion - midway to the vault 132a</strong>:
C.U. on three hands, as they reach up to pull three of the countless
chains.</p>
<p><strong>the coal chute on the side of the house –</strong>: drops
open, dumping out Fester, Abigail, and Tully - all of them wet and
bedraggled and gasping for air.</p>
<p><strong>abigail</strong>: You’re doing this on purpose.</p>
<p><strong>a133 continued: a133</strong>: They all struggle to their
feet and march grimly back toward the door.</p>
<p><strong>133 int. wampum court bungalow - morning 133</strong>: Gomez
is STRETCHED OUT on the naked box springs of his bed – the mattress
pushed aside. A damp cloth covers his eyes. Thing MASSAGES his aching
head. A bowl of MOTEL SOAPS is beside him. In contrast, Morticia
squarely faces the crisis. She addresses the family from the head of the
breakfast table, the want ads open on the table before her.</p>
<p><strong>morticia</strong>: We are Addamses, and we will not submit.
Who recalls the fable of the tortoise and the hare? The swift, yet lazy
little cottontail, and his slow but determined companion? What does that
story teach us, as Addamses?</p>
<p><strong>granny</strong>: Kill the hare. Skin it. Boil it.</p>
<p><strong>wednesday</strong>: Put the tortoise on the highway.</p>
<p><strong>pugsley</strong>: During rush hour.</p>
<p><strong>morticia</strong>: Yes! We will survive! Poison us, strangle
us, break our bones - we will come back for more. And why?</p>
<p><strong>granny</strong>: Because we like it!</p>
<p><strong>pugsley</strong>: Because we’re Addamses!</p>
<p><strong>gomez</strong>: We’re Addamses…</p>
<p><strong>136 ext. sidewalk in front of the wampum court - day
136</strong>: Wednesday and Pugsley have set up a LEMONADE STAND, their
contribution to the Addams’ financial well-being. An array of POISONS
are lined up on their rickety table. They’ve slashed their prices to a
nickel per cup. The pitcher on the table before them steams. Cars speed
by. Carrying a SAMPLE VACUUM CLEANER and a bucket, Lurch comes out of
the motel courtyard. Pugsley offers him a cup of punch.</p>
<p><strong>pugsley</strong>: Here, Lurch. On the house.</p>
<p><strong>138 int. employment agency 138</strong>: Morticia is being
interviewed by a PERSONNEL OFFICER, a relentlessly perky gal with a
clipboard.</p>
<p><strong>personnel officer</strong>: We have so many homemakers

he currently employed?</p>
<p><strong>morticia</strong>: He’s… he’s going through a bad patch at
the moment. But it’s not his fault.</p>
<p><strong>personnel officer</strong>: Of course not. What is he - A
loafer? A hopeless layabout? A shiftless dreamer?</p>
<p><strong>morticia</strong>: Not anymore.</p>
<p><strong>139 int. addams living room - day 139</strong>: Abigail and
Fester are seated at opposite ends of the couch. Fester stares off into
space. Abigail is going through a stack of colorful travel
brochures.</p>
<p><strong>abigail</strong>: The Mediterranean, the Riviera - once we
find the money, we’ll go everywhere. We’ll try again, right after lunch.
Gordon - where should we go first?</p>
<p><strong>fester</strong>: I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>abigail</strong>: Acapulco? Cancun? Ariba! Ariba!</p>
<p><strong>fester</strong>: You choose.</p>
<p><strong>a140 ext. wampum court - later that day a140</strong>:
Wednesday and Pugsley are at their lemonade stand. They are negotiating
with a PRISSY LITTLE GIRL IN A GIRL SCOUT UNIFORM. The girl scout
carries several boxes of Girl Scout cookies.</p>
<p><strong>girl scout</strong>: Is this made from real lemons?</p>
<p><strong>wednesday</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>girl scout</strong>: I only like all-natural foods and
beverages. Organically grown, with no preservatives. Are you sure
they’re real lemons?</p>
<p><strong>pugsley</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>girl scout</strong>: Well… I tell you what. I’ll buy a cup,
if you buy a box of my delicious girl scout cookies. Do we have a
deal?</p>
<p><strong>wednesday</strong>: Are they made from real girl scouts?</p>

Geraniums in the flower boxes. Surrounded by a white picket fence.</p>
<p><strong>at the door,</strong>: he rings the doorbell, afraid he might
break something. A BLONDE HOUSEWIFE in tennis whites, obviously in a
hurry, opens the door – only to be greeted by a BUCKETFUL OF SLOP thrown
past her, onto her peach Oriental rug. She SCREAMS in horror, turns to
challenge the perpetrator of this atrocity and, seeing Lurch, SCREAMS
again. In a panic, she tries to slam the door on Lurch, but, like the
salesman’s manual undoubtedly advised, he STICKS his foot in the way.
The door partially RIPS off its hinges. Lurch steps inside and shuts the
door as best he can. A moment passes. The door swings open and Lurch
exits, jauntily waving a check.</p>
<p><strong>144 int. daycare center - day 144</strong>: Morticia is
telling a story to a group of TODDLERS, who have gathered in a circle
around her, sitting on carpet squares. The room is sunny and cheerful,
with crayon drawings taped to the walls.</p>
<p><strong>morticia</strong>: … and so the witch lured Hansel and Gretel
into the candy house, by promising them more sweets. And she told them
to look in the oven, and she was about to push them in, when, low and
behold, Hansel pushed the poor, defenseless witch into the oven instead.
Where she was burned alive, writhing in agony. Now, boys and girls, what
do you think that feels like?</p>

the naked box springs. He stares vacantly at a game show on TV.
“Jeopardy” is on.</p>

known as the Butcher of Bavaria.”</p>

now, club raised, hurries past the open window of the bungalow. She
stops at the sight of Gomez inside, standing on the bed, staring at the
television. C.U. on the TV set - Gomez is now watching Geraldo Rivera,
hosting his tabloid style show.</p>
<p><strong>geraldo</strong>: Voodoo zombies - the stuff of legend, or a
living nightmare? Do zombies really exist? How are they made? Where can
we find them? Call in with your comments.</p>

Abigail and Gordon are seated at opposite ends of the table, having
lunch. It is very quiet.</p>
<p><strong>abigail</strong>: After lunch, we’ll try again.</p>
<p><strong>fester</strong>: Yes, Mother.</p>
<p><strong>abigail</strong>: We’ll find the money. And meanwhile, we
have this little nest. Quiet and cozy. Without that dreadful family.</p>
<p><strong>fester</strong>: Yes, Mother.</p>
<p><strong>abigail</strong>: Just the two of us, away from the world.
Our dream come true.</p>
<p><strong>fester</strong>: Yes, Mother.</p>
<p><strong>a155 int. bungalow - an hour later a155</strong>: C.U. on the
TV screen. Geraldo is talking to a woman in the studio audience.</p>
<p><strong>geraldo</strong>: So your son was brainwashed by voodoo slave
masters and forced to recruit others. Let’s take a call.</p>
<p><strong>gomez</strong>: Geraldo…</p>
<p><strong>geraldo</strong>: Mr. Addams, please stop calling. We don’t
know where they meet.</p>
<p><strong>a155 continued: a155</strong>: PULL BACK to the motel room.
Gomez lets the phone drop. Morticia, seated on the edge of the box
spring, tries to comfort him. Pugsley, Wednesday and Lurch are seated
nearby, very worried about Gomez, as at a death watch. Gomez is now
surrounded by junk food, and a mountain of junk food wrappers, bags and
styrofoam containers. Ritually, as handmaidens, Morticia brings Gomez
the remote control for the TV, and Wednesday brings him a copy of TV
Guide. Pugsley brings Gomez a bag of “Doritos”, and Lurch brings him a
canister of “Pringles”.</p>
<p><strong>gomez</strong>: Re-run.</p>
<p><strong>pugsley</strong>: I don’t understand. All he does is watch TV
and eat.</p>
<p><strong>morticia</strong>: I know - Gomez, let’s go for a drive. The
whole family.</p>
<p><strong>gomez</strong>: A drive? And miss “Matlock”?</p>

<p><strong>a155a int. wampum court - later a155a</strong>: Morticia is
putting Wednesday to bed.</p>
<p><strong>wednesday</strong>: If that man isn’t Uncle Fester, then who
is he, mother?</p>
<p><strong>morticia</strong>: I don’t know, darling. I wish I did.</p>
<p><strong>wednesday</strong>: Why is that lady doing all this?</p>
<p><strong>morticia</strong>: It’s hard to say. Sometimes people have
had terrible childhoods. And sometimes they just haven’t found their
special place in life. And sometimes they’re dogs from hell and must be
destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>b155 int. wampum - middle of the night b155</strong>: The
family sleeps - all but Morticia. She sits up in bed beside Gomez. She
looks around at her family. Wednesday sleeps in the same bed as Granny.
Lurch is flat out on the floor. Pugsley uses him for a mattress, and
Thing uses Pugsley. Pugsley snores the inhale part of a snore, Lurch
groans the exhale part, and Thing punctuates by wiggling. Morticia
stares down at Gomez - for a long beat. She strokes his hair lovingly.
Full of resolve, she gets out of bed.</p>
<p><strong>ac155 int. fester’s bedroom - night ac155</strong>: Fester is
lying in bed, the covers around his chin. Abigail sits on the bed beside
him, tucking him in.</p>
<p><strong>abigail</strong>: I know why you’ve been so glum. It’s
because it’s taking us a little longer than we’d hoped to find the gold.
Isn’t that right?</p>
<p><strong>abigail</strong>: Of course it is. Well, don’t you worry -
we’re right on the verge. Tomorrow, for certain, my darling. You know,
some people might think it’s strange, for a mother and son to be so
close. I think it’s beautiful. Don’t you, Gordon?</p>
<p><strong>abigail</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>fester</strong>: Yes, mother. It’s beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>abigail</strong>: dabbing her eye with</p>
<p><strong>d155 ext. gate - a little later d155</strong>: Morticia, just
outside Gate, struggles to get it open, Thing clutching the bars, also
attempting to block her way.</p>
<p><strong>morticia</strong>: Stop it, you two.</p>
<p><strong>e155 ext. addams mansion - a little later e155</strong>:
Tully opens the front door. He smiles maliciously at the sight of
Morticia on the stoop.</p>
<p><strong>morticia</strong>: I would like to speak with Fester.</p>
<p><strong>tully</strong>: We’ve been expecting you…</p>
<p><strong>155 ext. intersection at the foot of the addams hill - night
155</strong>: Thing does his damnedest to flag down any of the few
oncoming cars. He waves to no avail, DANCES AROUND in frustration, then
tries HITCHHIKING, sticking out his thumb. A passing car splashes him
with mud. Screwing up his courage, in a kamikaze leap, he GRABS ahold of
the bumper of the next car that comes along and hangs on for dear life
as the car SPEEDS down the street.</p>
<p><strong>156 int. study - a little later 156</strong>: Morticia is now
stretched out on the torture RACK. Fester and Tully are securing her
hands and feet, under Abigail’s supervision. Fester seems torn,
agitated, upset.</p>
<p><strong>morticia</strong>: You are a desperate woman, consumed by
greed and infinite bitterness. We could have been such friends.</p>
<p><strong>abigail</strong>: I don’t think so. The vault, Mrs. Addams -
any thoughts?</p>
<p><strong>morticia</strong>: Despite everything, I don’t hate you. I
pity you. Persecution, fiendish torture, inhuman depravity - sometimes
it’s just not enough.</p>
<p><strong>abigail</strong>: Gordon - let’s get started.</p>
<p><strong>fester</strong>: But, Mother…</p>
<p><strong>abigail</strong>: Stop stalling!</p>
<p><strong>fester</strong>: I’m not stalling! Stop badgering me!</p>
<p><strong>abigail</strong>: Tully, take over! Tighten it!</p>
<p><strong>tully</strong>: I’d love to, you know that, but - I’ve got
this stomach thing. When I torture people. It’s just me.</p>
<p><strong>abigail</strong>: Do it!</p>
<p><strong>tully</strong>: Where’s your bathroom?</p>
<p><strong>now!</strong>: Tully shuts his eyes and tightens the rack.
Morticia’s bones make a horrible POPPING, STRETCHING SOUND. She MOANS,
rather sensually.</p>
<p><strong>abigail</strong>: Again!</p>
<p><strong>abigail</strong>: Tighter!</p>
<p><strong>morticia</strong>: You’ve done this before.</p>
<p><strong>157 ext. wampum court - night 157</strong>: A hand possessed,
Thing RACES up the driveway, raising dust as he goes.</p>
<p><strong>158 ext. bungalow - night 158</strong>: Thing leaps
dramatically onto the porch, then stops dead to knock on the cabin door.
After a beat:</p>
<p><strong>gomez</strong>: Who is it? We’re paid through Thursday.</p>
<p><strong>159 int. bungalow - minutes later 159</strong>: Thing
skitters on the kitchen counter, frantically signing. In the background,
the rest of the family sleeps.</p>
<p><strong>gomez</strong>: Slow down, Thing! It’s terrible when you
stutter!</p>
<p><strong>gomez</strong>: Morticia in danger… stop! Send help at once …
stop!</p>
<p><strong>161 int. gomez’s study - a few minutes later 161</strong>:
Morticia is now lashed to an ENORMOUS TORTURE WHEEL. Tully and Abigail
are tending the stick BRANDING IRONS stuck in the roaring fire.</p>
<p><strong>fester</strong>: You can’t! Not with red-hot pokers!</p>
<p><strong>tully</strong>: Is this gonna smell?</p>
<p><strong>morticia</strong>: Tully Alford - charlatan. Deadbeat.
Parasite. How Gomez adored you.</p>
<p><strong>tully</strong>: Well, not enough.</p>
<p><strong>fester</strong>: Morticia, please…</p>
<p><strong>morticia</strong>: Dear Fester - or whomever you are. Which
is the real you - the loathsome, under-handed monster you’ve become? Or
the loathsome, underhanded monster we came to love?</p>
<p><strong>fester</strong>: Don’t ask me…</p>
<p><strong>morticia</strong>: Fester - I saw you tonight, at my window.
I know it was you.</p>
<p><strong>abigail</strong>: Gordon?</p>
<p><strong>fester</strong>: I was… restless! I couldn’t sleep.</p>
<p><strong>abigail</strong>: Gordon, I have a thought. Just a notion,
top of my head. Tell me what you think. Since you and Mrs. Addams are so
very close…</p>
<p><strong>abigail</strong>: … be my guest.</p>

<p><strong>a165 int. duesenberg - night a165</strong>: Gomez cuts the

uncharacteristically without a creak. Gomez stops the car and skulks
out. Thing skulks after him. Gomez sees the reflections of the roaring
fire through the study window.</p>
<p><strong>gomez</strong>: Cara mia!</p>
<p><strong>morticia</strong>: Mon cher!</p>
<p><strong>abigail</strong>: Addams!</p>
<p><strong>morticia</strong>: Darling, take care!</p>

<p><strong>tully</strong>: This is for keeps, Gomez! Not just
doubloons!</p>
<p><strong>gomez</strong>: One for you, Tully, and…</p>
<p><strong>gomez</strong>: … one for me!</p>
<p><strong>tully</strong>: Gomez… it’s Tully. I’m your lawyer. I’m on
retainer.</p>
<p><strong>abigail</strong>: Let him up!</p>
<p><strong>abigail -</strong>: who now has a pistol aimed at Morticia.
One shot and Morticia will die horribly. Gomez throws aside his sword.
Tully scrambles to his feet.</p>
<p><strong>abigail</strong>: That’s right! Now get moving - Addams, take
him to the vault. And if you’re not back in one hour… I displace
her.</p>
<p><strong>gomez</strong>: Tish - seeing you like this. My blood
boils.</p>
<p><strong>morticia</strong>: As does mine.</p>
<p><strong>gomez</strong>: This wheel of pain…</p>
<p><strong>morticia</strong>: Our wheel.</p>
<p><strong>gomez</strong>: To live without you - only that would be
torture.</p>
<p><strong>morticia</strong>: A day alone - only that would be
death.</p>
<p><strong>abigail</strong>: Knock it off! The vault, Addams - right
now!</p>
<p><strong>fester</strong>: But, Mother can’t we…</p>
<p><strong>abigail</strong>: Can it, Gordon! Stop dragging your feet!
You disgust me - you’re nothing but a useless, snivelling baby! A stone
around my neck! What was I thinking - I should’ve left you where I found
you!</p>
<p><strong>fester</strong>: No tricks, Gomez! That’s the wrong book!</p>
<p><strong>close up</strong>: Gomez’s hand is on the right book,
“Greed,” but Fester stops him from pulling it.</p>
<p><strong>fester</strong>: Allow me…</p>
<p><strong>gomez</strong>: Good show, old man…</p>
<p><strong>tully</strong>: Put that book down, Gordon! You don’t know
what it can do! It’s not just literture!</p>
<p><strong>fester</strong>: Oh, really?</p>
<p><strong>tully</strong>: I’m your friend, Gordon - think of the
doubloons!</p>

<p><strong>gomez</strong>: Leather straps, red-hot pokers…</p>

<p><strong>abigail</strong>: Keep the book closed, Gordon - listen to
mother!</p>
<p><strong>fester</strong>: I’ll never listen to you - not ever
again!</p>
<p><strong>abigail</strong>: I had to be strict with you - because I
cared! Put it down!</p>

<p><strong>174 ext. addams mansion, next october - night 174</strong>: A
group of little CHILDREN approach the front door. There is a
hand-lettered sign on the door reading “HALLOWEEN OPEN HOUSE.” The
children are dressed in traditional Halloween costumes - there’s a
witch, a ghost, a skeleton, etc., and they all carry trick-or-treat
bags. They giggle and chatter. One of the children is pushed forward,
and he KNOCKS on the front door. As the door opens, the children
CHANT:</p>
<p><strong>children</strong>: Trick or…</p>
<p><strong>175 int. front hall - same time 175</strong>: Lurch is
closing the front door, looking puzzled. The family is busily decorating
the house for their annual Halloween festivities. All the decorations
are elegant yet ancient, dusty and faded. The crystal gloves in the
chandeliers have been replaced by miniature jack o- lanterns. Skeletons,
each wearing a top hat, hang from the sconces by the nooses around their
necks. There are clusters of black and orange balloons, covered with
cobwebs. Uncle Fester and Thing are draping the banisters and stairway
railings with a garland made from crepe paper, dead branches and spanish
moss. Skulls, each holding a candle, are scattered about, on the stairs
and the furniture. A stuffed, life-size scarecrow leans against the
stairway, with a pitchfork through its throat. A banner on the wall
reads “HAPPY HALLOWEEN”, and the letters drip with blood. Gomez hangs
upside down from the balcony. Morticia hands him a decoration. Granny
appears from the kitchen, carrying a tray of food.</p>
<p><strong>granny</strong>: Well, it’s their loss. I even made finger
sandwiches.</p>
<p><strong>fester</strong>: Oh, calm down.</p>
<p><strong>pugsley</strong>: Here we come!</p>

<p><strong>morticia</strong>: Oh yes - in the den.</p>
<p><strong>175 continued: 175</strong>: Everyone starts to move toward
the den. There is a KNOCK on the door. Everyone turns. Lurch opens the
door. Standing outside are Margaret and Cousin It. Margaret is dressed
as a fairy princess, complete with wand. Cousin It wears a cowboy hat, a
bandanna and a holster. Margaret is radiant, obviously very much in
love.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Trick or treat!</p>
<p><strong>cousin it</strong>: Ooot oot glibber.</p>

<p><strong>gomez</strong>: It is a wonderful hat.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: And what are you, darling? Where’s your
costume?</p>

maniac. They look just like everyone else.</p>

Fester and Pugsley are posed at one end of the room. Lurch has set up an
easel and canvas; he is painting Fester and Pugsley’s portrait. Gomez
and Wednesday are sitting on the floor amid newspapers, carving a
pumpkin. Morticia is knitting. Margaret and Cousin It sit together,
holding hands. Granny brings people cups of steaming punch, from a punch
bowl.</p>
<p><strong>fester</strong>: Halloween - it’s such a special time. Ghosts
and goblins. Witches on broomsticks.</p>
<p><strong>wednesday</strong>: Children begging in the streets.</p>
<p><strong>fester</strong>: I’m so glad I can share this night with my
family - my real family. Now that I’ve got my memory back.</p>
<p><strong>morticia</strong>: That unfortunate woman. Filled with evil.
But not enough.</p>
<p><strong>pugsley</strong>: She wasn’t your mother. She just said
that.</p>
<p><strong>cousin it</strong>: Ooot oot gleep.</p>
<p><strong>gomez</strong>: You remember, old sport - she really did find
him tangled in a tuna net, twenty-five years ago. With amnesia.</p>

<p><strong>gomez</strong>: Pugsley…</p>

There’s no place like home. And blood is thicker than water.</p>

<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I’ve never played this before - how does

<p><strong>granny</strong>: Did you bring a shovel?</p>
<p><strong>pugsley</strong>: Uncle Fester, will you be on my team?</p>
<p><strong>wednesday</strong>: No, mine!</p>
<p><strong>fester</strong>: I tell you what - we’ll give you a head
