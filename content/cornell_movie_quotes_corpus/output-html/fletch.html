<h1 id="fletch">fletch</h1>
<p><strong>ext.california beach </strong>: DAY 1Seagulls squawk, and the
waves pound, but were not talking about Malibu Colony, here. This is a
fairly rundown beach area, catering to lower-echelon surfers, vagrants,
and strung out druggies of all ages, several of whom stand or sit on
their haunches by a dilapidated old hamburger stand. Over the stand is a
faded sign: "FAT SAMS HAMBURGERS". A simple but haunting electronic
melody plays in the b.g.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: So what do you figure?</p>
<p><strong>fat sam</strong>: No idea.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: No idea at all?</p>
<p><strong>fat sam</strong>: Okay. Some idea.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Like when?</p>
<p><strong>fat sam</strong>: Like tonight.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: For sure?</p>
<p><strong>fat sam</strong>: No, not for sure. When it comes, it comes.
You gonna want some $hit?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I think Id rather have drugs.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Maybe tonight?  </p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Whaddyamean ‘maybe’?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I don’t know how he doesn’t know. He doesn’t
know.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Excuse me. I have something I’d like to discuss
with you.</p>
<p><strong>stanwyk</strong>: We can’t talk about it here.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Are you on a scavenger hunt of some
kind?</p>
<p><strong>stanwyk</strong>: I’ll give you a thousand dollars cash just
to come to my house and listen to the proposition.     If you reject the
proposition, you keep the thousand, and your mouth shut.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I always liked this part of town.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: What a coincidence.</p>
<p><strong>stanwyk</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I came this close… …to buying this place</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Then I found out Hopalong Cassidy had shot
himself in the game room. That just blew it for me.</p>
<p><strong>stanwyk</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Hopalong Cassidy. Killed himself here. Bow
and arrow. Strange.</p>
<p><strong>stanwyk</strong>: What are you, doped up or something?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I don’t work for you yet, assface. Don’t
talk to me like that.</p>
<p><strong>stanwyk</strong>: Come inside.</p>
<p><strong>stanwyk</strong>: Buenas dias.</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: Buenas dias.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I commend you on your Spanish.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Ahh, the library. Masculine but
sensitive.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Really, I love what you’ve done with the
place. Must have cost you…hundreds.</p>
<p><strong>stanwyk</strong>: Here’s my proposition, Mr. Fletcher.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I’m all ears.</p>
<p><strong>stanwyk</strong>: I want you to murder me.</p>
<p><strong>stanwyk</strong>: Here. On Thursday. I’d like you to shoot me
dead.</p>
<p><strong>stanwyk</strong>: The reason I ask you to do me this service
is that I am facing a long, painful, and most certain death. You see, I
have bone cancer. I don’t know if you know anything about bone
cancer.</p>
<p><strong>stanwyk</strong>: It doesn’t get any worse than that. Just
eats you up, bit by bit.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: You don’t look sick, Mr. Stanwyk.</p>
<p><strong>stanwyk</strong>: I don’t feel sick. Not yet. They tell me
it’ll start getting bad in about a month. After that… well, I’d rather
not be around for it.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Why don’t you try suicide?</p>
<p><strong>stanwyk</strong>: My company has taken out a very large
insurance policy on me. And I have a wife. Suicide would nullify my
insurance. Murder does not.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: So why pick me?</p>
<p><strong>stanwyk</strong>: You’re a drifter, a – pardon the expression
– beach bum. No one would notice if you disappeared. I’ve watched you
for a couple weeks.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Maybe I’m just on vacation.</p>
<p><strong>stanwyk</strong>: Not with the scum you hang out with. I’ve
watched. I’ve thought. Its a perfect scheme. I even have a perfect
escape plan for you.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Did it ever occur to you that I might not
want to kill you?</p>
<p><strong>stanwyk</strong>: I’ve got fifty thousand dollars says you
will.</p>
<p><strong>stanwyk</strong>: Fifty thousand and a guarantee you won’t
get caught.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I’m still here.</p>
<p><strong>stanwyk</strong>: I want it done Thursday evening, around
eight PM. My wife will be off to the club for a committee meeting. It’s
the staff’s night off. These will be open.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Wouldn’t they normally be locked?</p>
<p><strong>stanwyk</strong>: Sometimes yes, sometimes no. The staff
usually forgets.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I have the same problem with my help.</p>
<p><strong>stanwyk</strong>: I will be here in the room, waiting for
you. The safe will be open and there will be fifty thousand dollars in
it. You will be wearing rubber gloves. Do you own rubber gloves?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I rent them. Monthly lease, with an option
to buy.</p>
<p><strong>stanwyk</strong>: In this drawer….</p>
<p><strong>stanwyk</strong>: Very good. My .357. Use it and no one can
trace it to you. The room will be in some disarray.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: So it looks like a burglary attempt. You
catch me. I get the gun, and shoot you.</p>
<p><strong>stanwyk</strong>: Precisely. Are you a good shot?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: What’s the difference? The noise’ll kill you
first.</p>
<p><strong>stanwyk</strong>: Get me on the first shot, if you can.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I don’t think you’ll have to worry about
that.</p>
<p><strong>stanwyk</strong>: Do you have a passport?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Sure, all drifters do.</p>
<p><strong>stanwyk</strong>: Fine. After you kill me, take the Jaguar.
The keys will be in the glove compartment.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Take it where?</p>
<p><strong>stanwyk</strong>: LAX. Go to the Pan Am desk. There will be a
ticket waiting for you.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Where am I going?</p>
<p><strong>stanwyk</strong>: Rio. Flight 306. Departs at eleven PM.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: They serve dinner on the flight?</p>
<p><strong>stanwyk</strong>: It’ll be a first class-ticket. I’m sure
you’ll enjoy the ride. I would recommend staying down there at least a
year, Mr. Fletcher.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: You’ve certainly thought this out, haven’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>stanwyk</strong>: I am not someone who leaves a great deal to
chance, Mr. Fletcher.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: You sure those doors will be open?</p>
<p><strong>stanwyk</strong>: Yes. All you provide are the gloves, the
passport, and the aim. I’ll take care of everything else.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: The gun, the money, the tickets, and the
dying.</p>
<p><strong>stanwyk</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: You sure got the hard part.</p>
<p><strong>stanwyk</strong>: What do you say, Mr. Fletcher? You’ll be
doing me and my family a great service.</p>
<p><strong>stanwyk</strong>: Will you kill me?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Whoa, check out the beach boy!</p>
<p><strong>second reporter</strong>: Looking very good, Fletch.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Thank you so much Hey, Larry!</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Yo!</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Can I steal you for a minute?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Only if you promise not to return me.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Deal.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: ‘Magic’ today, huh?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Kareem’s in the wash. I need a favor.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Shoot.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Don’t say shoot, okay.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Fletch. Fletch!</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Did you hear something?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Not me.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Me neither. See what we’ve got on a guy
named Alan Stanwyk, okay? I need it right away.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Fletch, I take it by your presence here that
the story is done. Tell me I’m right.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: W-Y-K no ‘c.’ I’ll be down in a minute.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: No problem, boss.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Fletch.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Frank, you look a little peaked. Wanna
vomit?</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: No, I want an answer, Is the story done?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Uh, almost.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: ‘Uh, almost’ is not an answer. ‘Yes Frank,
it’s all done’: that’s an answer.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: And a damn fine one, I might add.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Two….</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Irwin….</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Oh, I hate it when he calls me that.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Irwin, professional journalism time, now. Go
back to the goddamn beach and finish the goddamn story!</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I will, Frank, I will. Something came up,
okay?</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: No it’s not okay. You have to have this in
by tomorrow. Did you see the ad we ran Sunday?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I never read the paper.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: …never reads the paper…</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: What’s the spread on the game tonight?</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: I don’t know. Look!</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Looks great.</p>
<p><strong>next week</strong>: A "JANE DOE" SPECIAL REPORT:</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: ‘Shame of Our City’ is so good.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Now, Irwin, try to follow me. You can’t run
the ad and then not run the story.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Why not? Oh $hit…really?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Just kidding, Frank. You’ll have the story
and you’ll be damn proud of it.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: You broke it? You know the source?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Practically.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: What’s ‘practically’? Is it Fat Sam? You
said you had pictures of him….</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I have pictures of him. Dealing….</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: So let’s go! We run the pictures.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: He’s not the story! There’s a source behind
him.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Well, there we’re in a gray area.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: How gray?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I’d say charcoal.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: I’m going to bite out your eyeballs, you
know that?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Frank, you animal, I love it. I’ll have the
story by Thursday night, I swear to God. I hope.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Everything’s recent.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: ‘Mr. Stanwyk, of Provo, Utah, is a former
commercial pilot.’</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Married Boyd Aviation. He’s no dummy, that’s
serious coin.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: ‘Stanwyk’s parents, Marvin and Velma
Stanwyk, also of Provo, were unable to attend the wedding.’</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Not our kind of people, you understand.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Spot right here.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: You doing a story on this guy?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: ’…Stanwyk, blahblahblah, with internist
Doctor Joseph Dolen.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I wonder if that’s his doctor.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Only one way to find out.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dolen</strong>: So where do you know Alan from?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: We play tennis at the club.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dolen</strong>: Really. The California Racquet Club?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dolen</strong>: That’s my club too. I haven’t seen you
there.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Well, I haven’t played in a while because of
these kidney pains.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dolen</strong>: Right, and how long have you had these
pains, Mr. Barber?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: That’s Babar.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dolen</strong>: Two bs?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: One. B-a-b-a-r.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dolen</strong>: That’s two.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: But not right next to each other. I thought
that’s what you meant.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dolen</strong>: Arnold Babar. Isn’t there a children’s
book about an elephant named Babar?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I don’t know. I don’t have any.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dolen</strong>: No children?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: No books. No elephants either. No really
good elephant books.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dolen</strong>: Still, it’d an odd name. I don’t remember
seeing it on the club registry.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Oh, I don’t belong formally. I’ve gone with
my aunt.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dolen</strong>: Your aunt?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Mrs. Smith.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dolen</strong>: Joan or Margaret Smith.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dolen</strong>: Well, which one?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Margaret.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dolen</strong>: Funny old bird.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Is she ever. I’ve got some stories….</p>
<p><strong>dr. dolen</strong>: I’ll bet. Shame about Ed.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: It was. Really a shame. To go so
suddenly.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dolen</strong>: Oh, he was dying for years.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Sure, but the end was so sudden.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dolen</strong>: He was in intensive care for eight
weeks.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Yes, but the very end, when he actually
died, that was extremely sudden. You know, Alan and I were recently
speaking of dying. Told me Boyd Aviation took out a lot of insurance on
him. You must have to be in some kind of perfect health to get that kind
of policy.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dolen</strong>: Bend over and drop your pants,
Mr. Babar.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Oh really, there’s no need to – we don’t
want to do that….</p>
<p><strong>dr. dolen</strong>: Just relax….</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Honest, I feel fine. You better be
married.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Did I say ‘kidneys’? I meant my ear. Maybe I
should see an ear dahhh – Ever serve time?</p>
<p><strong>dr. dolen</strong>: Breathe easy….</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Anyway, I’m surprised Alan got the policy so
easily. I know there’s a history of cancer in the family.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dolen</strong>: There is?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Whoa, look out there. You really need the
whole fist?</p>
<p><strong>dr. dolen</strong>: Just relax.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Gee, Alan’s been looking kind of sick
lately. Is he all right?</p>
<p><strong>dr. dolen</strong>: I can’t discuss another patient. You know
that. Well, I can’t find anything wrong with you.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I’m sure it’s not for a lack of looking.
Maybe I should get a real complete physical. You give Alan an annual,
don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>dr. dolen</strong>: Yeah, we check you into Mt. Hebron for a
few days, run lots of tests, charge a bundle. You can pull your pants up
now.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I hope they still fit. Do I get to keep the
glove?</p>
<p><strong>dr. dolen</strong>: Tell the nurse when you’ve got a few free
days. She’ll make all the arrangements.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Thanks, Doc. Maybe I’ll come back with a
date. Or an elephant.</p>
<p><strong>records nurse</strong>: Identification please.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: It’s me doctor Rosenpenis. I just have to
take another peek at Alan Stanwyk’s file. What have they done with this
place?</p>
<p><strong>records nurse</strong>: Nothing. They’re still there.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Right. Fine.</p>
<p><strong>pathologist</strong>: Hey you!</p>
<p><strong>pathologist</strong>: Give me a hand for a second would you
doctor?</p>
<p><strong>pathologist</strong>: Come on, come on.</p>
<p><strong>pathologist</strong>: Have you ever see a spleen this
large?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Not recently.</p>
<p><strong>pathologist</strong>: Grab this, will you?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Uh, I’m not really prepared. My hands aren’t
sterilized.</p>
<p><strong>pathologist</strong>: You’re not going to make this guy any
sicker.</p>
<p><strong>pathologist</strong>: You never really get used to the smell,
do you?</p>
<p><strong>records nurse</strong>: Are you all right, Doctor?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Where am I?</p>
<p><strong>records nurse</strong>: You’re in the Records Room.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>records nurse</strong>: Can I get you something?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Have you got a make-shift plywood pillory?
Heh Heh, just kidding.</p>
<p><strong>records nurse</strong>: Doctor Holmes went to get you some
smelling salts. He was quite surprised that you fainted.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Well, I didn’t want to say anything, but I
thought the dead man was my brother.</p>
<p><strong>records nurse</strong>: Oh my God!</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: It’s all right. It wasn’t him but that
spleen was a splitting image.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Oh, God, I think I’m about to
hyperventilate. Have you got a paper bag, or something.</p>
<p><strong>records nurse</strong>: Yes, right away.</p>
<p><strong>records nurse</strong>: Here you are, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>records nurse</strong>: Is there anything particular you’re
looking for?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: My associates did a biopsy on this man
recently. He’s supposed to have a melanoma, or a carcinoma, some kind of
noma. Hmmm. I can’t seem to find any record of it.</p>
<p><strong>records nurse</strong>: Well, if he had one, it would
certainly be in here. Wait. Here it is. Yep. Surgical removal of two
moles. Tissue was benign.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: That’s it?</p>
<p><strong>records nurse</strong>: That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: This was last month. So Alan Stanwyk does
not have cancer.</p>
<p><strong>records nurse</strong>: I guess not.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: He’ll be so relieved.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Christ.</p>
<p><strong>gillett</strong>: Refusal to pay alimony is a jailable
offense, Fletch.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: What about breaking and entering? Are you
wearing anything under that?</p>
<p><strong>gillett</strong>: I did not break nor enter. I simply chose
an advisable location to await my client’s delinquent husband.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I hate to conduct business on the lanai. Why
don’t we step inside.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: One on one?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: And the foul.</p>
<p><strong>gillett</strong>: You owe Wendy nine hundred and eighteen
dollars.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: She doesn’t need the money, for crissakes.
She’s living with Monty. I know it.</p>
<p><strong>gillett</strong>: I don’t know what you’re referring to.
Wendy maintains her own residence.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: It stinks. I thought woman were independent
now.</p>
<p><strong>gillett</strong>: Until she remarries, Fletch.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Hey, shut up, okay? I just hate this.</p>
<p><strong>gillett</strong>: I empathize with your plight, Fletch.
However, you threw her out.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: She was sleeping with everybody. The cable
TV guy. You can’t get lower than that….</p>
<p><strong>gillett</strong>: You should have proved that in a court of
law.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: My lawyer was a bum.</p>
<p><strong>gillett</strong>: I agree.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I think he was sleeping with Wendy, too.</p>
<p><strong>gillett</strong>: You may be right.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Are you serious?</p>
<p><strong>gillett</strong>: That’s history, Fletch. You owe us nine
hundred and eighteen dollars.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Wait a minute! Our problems might be
solved.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I think I just won a million dollars!</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Damn…lost again. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>gillett</strong>: This is no joke. If some kind of payment
isn’t made, we’re going to have to contact the paper and garnish your
wages.</p>
<p><strong>gillett</strong>: Cash. I’m impressed.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Found it in a cab. That’s a grand. Apply the
difference to next month.</p>
<p><strong>gillett</strong>: Till then.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Thank God.</p>
<p><strong>hearn</strong>: How about Fletch?</p>
<p><strong>jabbar</strong>: Well, Fletch has been great. He’s
super-strong, really clogs the middle for us, boxes out, gets the
bounds….</p>
<p><strong>hearn</strong>: Now here’s a key play in Tuesday night’s
game….</p>
<p><strong>jabbar</strong>: Here I am dishing off to Fletch….</p>
<p><strong>hearn</strong>: Gosh, he makes it look so easy!</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Gail Stanwyk!</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I haven’t seen you since the wedding, Jeez,
you look great.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: I do? Oh, isn’t that sweet, thank you.
I have to confess something to you. I must have been pretty plowed at
your wedding. I really don’t have the faintest idea who you are.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Huh? No, not my wedding. Yours.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: Oh, mine! Thank God. Actually, that
doesn’t make it any better, does it? Are you a friend of Alan’s?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: We used to fly together. I’m…John.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: John! You used to fly together!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: John who?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: John Ultrarelamensky.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: Oh, I’m sorry. It’s a beautiful name,
really.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: It’s Scotch-Rumanian.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: That’s a strange combination.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: So were my parents.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: Mind if I keep practicing? I need to
work on my ground stroke a little.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Excuse me sir. Are you a guest of the
club?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Yes, I’m with the Underhills.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: They just left, sir.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: They’ll be back. He had to go in for a
urinalysis.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Would you care for a drink while you’re
waiting? I can put it on the Underhill bill.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Great. I’ll have a Bloody Mary and a steak
sandwich.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Very good sir.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: Damn, I thought I had that one.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: You should play with much larger tennis
balls. So how’s Alan?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: What are you asking me for? He’s so
busy lately I hardly see him. And he’s been so preoccupied.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Preoccupied with what?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: Oh, personal stuff. Look! I hit
one!</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Good. Lobs are a very important part of the
game.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Why do you keep doing this?</p>
<p><strong>mrs stanwyk</strong>: I love the outfits.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Try stepping into the ball with your left
foot.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: There, much better.</p>
<p><strong>mrs stanwyk</strong>: Stay! I must be having an off day. I’m
really a fabulous player.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I have this effect on lots of women.</p>
<p><strong>mrs stanwyk</strong>: I bet you do.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Say, the reason I asked about Alan is that I
bumped into him this morning and you know what I can’t figure out?</p>
<p><strong>mrs stanwyk</strong>: Alan’s in Utah.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I can’t figure out why I went to Utah for
the morning.</p>
<p><strong>mrs stanwyk</strong>: Okay. I’m delighted to have someone to
talk to, and you’re very cute, so I’m very flattered, but I’m also very
married so you may as well forget – You are trying to hit on me, aren’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I’m such a heel. How’d you guess?</p>
<p><strong>mrs stanwyk</strong>: If I had a nickel for every one of
Alan’s flyboy buddies who tried to pick me up, I’d be a rich woman.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: You are a rich woman.</p>
<p><strong>mrs stanwyk</strong>: See what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: What’s he doing in Utah?</p>
<p><strong>mrs stanwyk</strong>: None of your business, now go away.
You’re throwing my game off.</p>
<p>****: …then who walks in but George Bush. He took one look around the
room…</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: …and said ‘Sorry Mr. President, I thought it
was Saturday.’</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I thought I was going to die.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Sugar, Mr. Poon?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: First of all, let me just reiterate that
this is not a formal investigation. I’m not going through formal
channels here, because if Alan Stanwyk is not involved in any
improprieties, then nobody has to know I was even —</p>
<p><strong>boyd</strong>: Alan Stanwyk is not involved in improprieties.
Where the hell does the S.E.C. come off —</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Look. You know that and I know that, but
somebody’s bucking for a promotion. I think it’s that bozo, Hanrahan, I
can’t be sure. Anyway, unless I go back there with something, you and
your son-in-law are next week’s scapegoats.</p>
<p><strong>boyd</strong>: Unbelievable.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I feel like dirt. They even want to know
what he’s doing in Utah?</p>
<p><strong>boyd</strong>: Utah? Jesus Christ! First of all, Alan Stanwyk
does not own one share of stock.The three million dollars for the ranch
in Provo comes from my daughter who converted some of her personal
holdings, not company holdings. Now if anybody in DC wants to make
something of that, bring ’em on. Until then, get the hell out of my
face.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: God I admire you.</p>
<p><strong>boyd</strong>: By the way: what kind of name is Poon?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Comanche Indian.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Oh, Margie, sorry, Frieda lost the number of
Alan’s realtor in Provo. Can you give it to me real quick?</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: Jim Swarthout?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: And, I’m sorry, who are you again?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Frieda’s boss.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: Who’s Frieda?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: My secretary.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Larry, it’s me….</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: See if you’ve got anything in Stanwyk’s
background from when he lived in Utah. Also check on a realtor in Provo
named Swarthout. And tell Frank I’m crazy about him and I’d like to
discuss his maybe moving in with me.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Later.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Fletch! Take off!</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: They’re after Gummy again. It’s weird.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Fletch, slow down.</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: Let’s go, Gummy.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Hey, what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Fletch, this is dumb.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: You don’t have to run with me, Crease.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Why are you beating up on that kid?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: He’s defenseless, and you kick the crap out
of him. What do you want from —</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Fletch!</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: What goddamn right do you have to take
him?</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Fletch!!!</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: Hey you’re really nuts.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: They didn’t do anything.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: What? What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I busted their window, they didn’t do
anything.</p>
<p><strong>creasy</strong>: You’re lucky.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Not luck. They don’t want me.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Gummy and two cops….</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Cool your tool, Frank, I need a little more
time. I think I’m really on to something here.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Your onto something. That’s good. What?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I really don’t want to spoil your surprise,
Frank. Why don’t you read it tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Speak, don’t point!</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I need Fletch for a second.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: She needs me, Frank.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Nothing on Gail Stanwyk, nothing on Jim
Swarthout. But I did —</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: That’s okay, Lar. I gotta put this on the
back burner for a while.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Just give me a hint, all right?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: All right. Maybe there are some crooked cops
involved in all this.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Did you say cops?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: That’s one thing I did find. It’s from Last
month, so it was in the unsorted pile.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: More cops. I think I gotta go to Utah,
Frank.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Utah?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Yeah. It’s wedged in between Wyoming and
Nevada. I’m sure you’ve seen pictures.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: What about finding the source?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I have some ideas.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Who? Donnie and Marie?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Very possibly. Come on, say yes. I’ll buy
you a shirt.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Go to transportation, get a ticket.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: My hero.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Nothing to it.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Hi, Jim Swarthout, please. Oh, hello, my
name is Igor Stravinski and I’m looking for some ranch property.</p>
<p><strong>swarthout</strong>: Good, Mr. Starinski, what’d you have in
mind? Uh huh. Oh are you a friend of Alan’s?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: No, I just heard some people at the club
talking about the property you sold him, and the way it was described,
three million sounded like a pretty good price. What?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Are you sure? Of course. I guess I was
misinformed. Listen, I’d love to come out and see you anyway. When are
you available?</p>
<p><strong>swarthout</strong>: Well, I’m about to close up shop and go
out for the evening. How about first thing in the AM? Great. See you
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: What’s your name fella? Fluff? Pom-pom?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Sht.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Sit-tuh!</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Roll over. Play dead. Good boy.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: You any relation to Doctor Dolan?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I hate this.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Make sure nobody comes in, okay?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: So much for your three million dollar
ranch.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Suck on this Cujo!</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Gimme a smile! There you go…oh, that’s a
nice one… Everything’s fine, now…go take a little nap….</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Look! Defenseless babies!</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: That dog is such an Ahole.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: ‘Bil-lie, Bil-lie…’</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: Oh, what’s this?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: If I took that out, you guys couldn’t fit in
here.</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: Funny boy. Look at this….</p>
<p><strong>cop#2</strong>: Looks like heroin, Gene.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: You just planted that.</p>
<p><strong>cop#2</strong>: What’d you say?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Read me my rights.</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: Okay. You have the right to remain silent.
You have the right to be kicked in the face by me. You have the rights
to have your balls stomped. You have the —</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Hold it! I’ll waive my rights.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Who we booking here, gentlemen?</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: No booking. Chief wants a talk with the
boy.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Oh Yeah? You’ll like the Chief. Nice
man.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I hear he’s mellowed a lot since he came out
of the closet.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: I find he gets real mellow after he hits
somebody a lot.</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: Here he is Chief.</p>
<p><strong>cummings</strong>: Easy fellas. Be with you in just a
second.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: You decorate this yourself or did Mrs. Chief
of Police help you?</p>
<p><strong>cummings</strong>: You should have seen what she wanted to do
with the place. Mauve. So what’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Fletch.</p>
<p><strong>cummings</strong>: Full name.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Fletch F. Fletch</p>
<p><strong>cummings</strong>: I see. And what do you do for a living,
Mr. Fletch?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I’m President of the International Fletch
Corporation.</p>
<p><strong>cummings</strong>: Why are you doing this Mr. Fletch?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Frankly sir, you look a little like my
father. Probaly explains the curious feeling of love I have for you.</p>
<p><strong>cummings</strong>: For a gentleman who was just found holding
a bag full of heroin….</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: It was planted on me, sir.</p>
<p><strong>cummings</strong>: We’re looking at five years, maybe ten. Is
that what you want…Jane Doe?</p>
<p><strong>cummings</strong>: Your editor called me yesterday to respond
to allegations you’re about to print about police involvement in
narcotics dealing.</p>
<p><strong>cummings</strong>: I’m about to break that beach wide open,
and I don’t need some pennyante Woodward and Bernstein getting in the
way of my men.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: ‘Your men’ might just be involved in all
this.</p>
<p><strong>cummings</strong>: You idiot. Off the record, deep
background: I’ve got that beach crawling with undercover cops.</p>
<p><strong>cummings</strong>: If you keep nosing around, you make the
bad guys just a little bit more cautious. That makes my job harder. And
if you print your story this week, you might get some of my men killed.
I can’t let that happen, Mr. Fletch.</p>
<p><strong>cummings</strong>: You go back to that goddamn beach, I swear
to God I’ll make you regret it.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Hey, you and Tommy Lasorda. That’s
great.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I don’t like Tommy Lasorda.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: You can’t keep me here.</p>
<p><strong>cummings</strong>: Maybe I’m not going to keep you here.
Maybe I’m gonna blow your brains out.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I’m no lawyer, but I do believe that’s a
violation of my rights.</p>
<p><strong>cummings</strong>: After I shoot you, I stick the knife in my
arm, then place it in your dead hand. Self-defense. We don’t do this
very much anymore…but we have. Got rid of a lot of minorities that
way.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: My God, you’re serious.</p>
<p><strong>cummings</strong>: Ask anybody.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Can I ask anybody now?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Can I call my Mom? I’d like to tell here how
much I’ve always loved her.</p>
<p><strong>cummings</strong>: What’ll it be Fletch?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I hate the beach. Wouldn’t go there if you
paid me. Besides, I’m way overdue on my story about off-track betting in
the Himalayas. You don’t think it’s the mafia, do you?</p>
<p><strong>cummings</strong>: Its been very nice meeting you. I enjoy
your column.</p>
<p><strong>cummings</strong>: Speaking of which, you’re not going to
print anything before my investigation is through, are you?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Not a prayer.</p>
<p><strong>cummings</strong>: That a boy.</p>
<p><strong>cummings</strong>: Thanks for coming down to see us.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Not at all, Chief. But next time…no tongue,
okay?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: How could you call him?</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: It’s called journalism, Fletch. It’s called
getting both sides of the story. Something you apparently don’t know
anything about.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: It’s also called getting me this close to
being murdered.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: He threw me in a cell, took a gun and a
knife and threatened to kill me right there if I didn’t promise to give
up the story.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: You know, I’ve had it up to here with your
bullsht. I need a story from you by tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: You’ll have it.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: But not unsubstantiated charges about
dope-dealing cops, and not horse sht paranoid fantasies about homicidal
police chiefs.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Thanks for the vote of confidence,
Frank.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: I want something I can print!</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Print this Frank.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Hi, where’s Mrs. Stanwyk?</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: In her cabana, sir.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Oh, that’s right. She told me to meet her
there. That’s cabana six?</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Cabana one.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: One.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Would you be caring for something to eat or
drink, sir?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I would, actually.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Charged to the Underhills, sir?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Right. Tell you what – have you caviar?</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Yes, sir. Beluga. But it is eighty dollars
the portion.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I’d better only get two. How about the
lobster thermidor?</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: I recommend it.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Fine. And a couple of bottles of Dom
Perignon. To cabana one.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Very good, sir.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: This is just the nicest place.</p>
<p><strong>154 omitted</strong>: and 155</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: It’s John. John… Znhcneelsky.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: John Ultramalensky?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I was hoping you’d say that.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: Uh…I’m just out of the shower.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Can I borrow your towel for a minute?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: I’m sorry, I’m just surprised to see
you. I didn’t think…What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I ordered lunch.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: You ordered it here?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Well, I knew this is where my mouth would
be.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: Down boy.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: I really should change.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: No, I think you should stay the same
wonderful person you are today.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: I mean put clothes on.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Here, take mine.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: Stop that!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: Have you gotten cuter since I last saw
you?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>sfx</strong>: Knock at door.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Lunch….</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: God….</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Come on in.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: You want I set up?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: No thanks, I’ll do it. Give yourself twenty
dollars. Underhill.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Muchas gracias.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Sierra del fuego.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: All this goes on Underhill’s bill?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I saved his life during the war.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: You were in the war?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: No. He was. I got him out.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: I can’t believe I’m doing this. Well,
lets eat.</p>
<p><strong>mr. underhill</strong>: Four hundred bucks for lunch???</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Your guest, sir.</p>
<p><strong>mr. underhill</strong>: We have no guest here today. Two
bottles of Dom Perignon, hundred bucks a pop. Jesus H. Christ! Where is
he?</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: I believe he’s with Mrs. Stanwyk.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. underhill</strong>: Gail Stanwyk. Tom, if he’s with Gail
Stanwyk —</p>
<p><strong>mr. underhill</strong>: I don’t care who he’s with! This is
criminal.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. underhill</strong>: Tom….</p>
<p><strong>mr. underhill</strong>: She’s where, cabana one?</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: ‘I’ve been so many places in my life and
times. I’ve sung a lot of songs, I’ve made some bad rhymes….’</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: It’s amazing.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: ‘I’ve acted out my life on stages, with ten
thousand people watching….’</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: Your bone structure, shoulders,
neck….</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: ‘But we’re alone now, and I’m singing this
song for you.’</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: Just like Alan. It’s freaky.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Can I ask you a question?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: Depends on the question.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Are you still in love with Alan?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: No. I mean, ‘no you can’t ask me
that.’ I mean, ask me something else.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Why’d you let me in?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: Because I’m bored. Oh, that sounds
terrible, doesn’t it. I’m sorry. If it makes you feel any better, I also
let you in because I’m hungry.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Thanks, I feel much better. Listen, if
you’re so bored, why didn’t you go to Utah with Alan?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: Utah is not exactly a cure for
boredom.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Good point.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: Oh, listen to me. I’ve never even been
there and look what I say about it. Anyway, I know there’d be nothing
for me to do. I don’t even know anybody there.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: What about his parents?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: He never sees them and I never met
them.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: How come?</p>
<p><strong>sfx</strong>: Insistent knock at door.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p>****: Mrs. Stanwyk, I hate to disturb you. Tom Underhill here…I’m a
new member.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Thanks for the great time.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Long story.</p>
<p>****: Apparently, someone of your acquaintance has charged the most
extraordinary lunch to my bill.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: John!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: You don’t know the Underhills?</p>
<p>****: I’d appreciate an opportunity to discuss this with you.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: I just stepped out of the shower! Can
you give me a minute?</p>
<p>****: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Take one end.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I’ll be leaving now, Mrs. Stanwyk.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: I think you should call me Gail,
now.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Gail. I hope this won’t embarrass you in any
way. I think Underhill’s a yutz, you won’t have any trouble with
him.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: Why did you do it?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: A four hundred dollar lunch tab!</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: I’ll cover it. You have any other
surprises?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Yeah. My name’s not John Ultramalensky and I
wasn’t at your wedding.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: Who.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Irwin Fletcher. I write a newspaper column
under the name Jane Doe.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: So, your husband hired me to kill him.
That’s the truth.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: That’s what I want to know.</p>
<p><strong>mr. underhill</strong>: Mrs. Stanwyk!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: In a minute!</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: He told me he was dying of cancer. Not True.
That ranch you thought you were paying for in Utah? Not true.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: How do you know about that?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: He’s a bad guy, Mrs. Stanwyk. Gail. I think
he’s involved in something very big and very bad.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: What does all this mean?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Have you ever heard the name Jim
Swarthout?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: Swarthout. Yes. He’s the man who sold
us the ranch in —</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Wrong. He sold you $3,000 worth of scrub
brush.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: But I’ve seen the deed.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: You saw a forgery.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: That’s the real deed.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Now, if this were at all legible, you’d
believe me.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Here’s this dog that tried to eat me. Here’s
my motel. Here’s the car I rented….</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: Stop it. Are you saying my husband is
defrauding me?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I don’t know. All I know is that he told me
a lot of things and so far not one of them has been true.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I’m really sorry I have to tell you all
this.</p>
<p>****: Mrs. Stanwyk?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: Just wait, all right?!? I’m going to
call my father. He’ll know what —</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: No. You can’t. Look, I know you don’t know
me from Adam, but you’ve got to trust me.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: Trust you? I may seem a little goofy
at times, but I’m not a complete Bozo, you know.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Just give me twenty-four hours. Please.
Someone almost killed me today. People are not being nice lately, and I
don’t want you getting hurt. I think you’re terrific. Are you a Laker
fan?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: No…I’ve got to go to
Mr. Underhill….</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I’ll take you to a game.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I’m talking about how much I’d like to take
you to a Laker game.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: Wait a second. What am I supposed to
do for twenty-four hours?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Act natural.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: I was afraid you’d say that.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: If you need me, call the paper. Hand me that
extra bottle okay?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: Sorry. Here. Thanks. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Should’ve known. Goddamn it.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Great. First I’ll get a speeding ticket,
then they’ll shoot me. Terrific.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: All right, fella, smog check. Move over.</p>
<p><strong>teenager</strong>: Holy sht!</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Sorry, youngster, but we have to see what
kind of fluorocarbons this thing puts out at ninety-five.</p>
<p><strong>teenager</strong>: Holy sht!</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Don’t worry about the speed limit. That’s
what the police escort’s for.</p>
<p><strong>teenager</strong>: Holy sht!</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: Sht! He’ll kill us if we lose him.</p>
<p><strong>teenager</strong>: Okay, okay, just stop, will you. I admit
it. I stole it. I was just taking it for a little joy ride, that’s
all….</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Holy sht.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Okay, kid. Just stand here with your hands
on the car and wait for the cops. I gotta pee. Here, take my hat.</p>
<p><strong>speaker</strong>: …and he can truly be called the Father of
Internal Bushings.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Hello. I’m with the hotel catering. Are you
enjoying your meal? Carrots overcooked?</p>
<p><strong>speaker</strong>: And now a man who needs no further
introduction….</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Thank you, Tony, thank you. As a lifelong
friend of…. …Fred Dorfman, I’m thrilled to be here.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Many of you are probably not aware of
Freddie’s lifelong commitment to honoring a profession that frequently
goes unsung – the police. Many times Fred used to forsake a night with
his wife and children to go out an sell tickets for the Policemen’s
Benevolent Association.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Our men in blue are with us today, and I
think we should all extend a shake of the hand, a slap on the back and a
‘howdy’ to them.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: When was the last time you hugged a cop? Do
it for my good friend Tommy Lasorda. Doesn’t it feel good? Don’t you
wish you’d done it long ago?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Let them know how we feel, with a song. For
every cop on every beat in every city of this great nation. ‘For he’s a
jolly good fellow….’ Everybody! ‘For he’s a jolly good fellow….’</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Yes sir, you are confirmed on Flight 306 to
Rio tomorrow evening at 11 PM. First Class.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: You’re kidding.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Would you like me to change anything?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: So he’s going. Uh…are there any other
tickets charged to the same account?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: We’d have no way of knowing that, sir.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Hmm. It’s just that there are some other
people from my office going on this trip and…is there anyone in the seat
next to me?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Yes, there is. Cavanaugh.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Never heard of him. Thanks anyway.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: You mean her.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Sally Ann Cavanaugh. Oh wait, she couldn’t
work in your office, she’s not from around here.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Oh, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: She’s from Utah.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: ‘Bom-ba-bom-bom…bommmm.’</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Who the hell are you?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Get up.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: The door was unlocked.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Lock’s busted.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: No wonder.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I work for the landlord. He told me to watch
out for the place.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I commend him on his choice.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I commend him on his choice</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I was supposed to meet Mrs. Cavanaugh.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Don Corleone. I’m a cousin of
Mrs. Cavanaugh’s.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Moved out.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: She moved out?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I spoke to her last week. She didn’t say
anything.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: She moved out.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: So you’re saying she moved out.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: This morning.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: This morning? Christ. We had so much to talk
about. Moe Green is out of the Tropicana, and my sons, Michael and
Fredo, are taking over.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: What did you want under the bed?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Mattress police. There are no tags on the
mattress. I’m going to have to take you downtown. Please give me your
weapon.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I’m calling the cops. This is for the cops.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I’m her cousin.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Tell the cops.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Go ahead. Call them. Better tie your
shoelaces first.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I’m getting real tired of all this
hostility.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Evening. They oughta recall these things.
One bump,the whole window goes.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Are you Mr. Marvin Stanwyk?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I’m Harry S. Truman from Casewell Insurance
Underwriters.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Harry S. Truman?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: My parents were great fans of the former
President.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Isn’t that nice. Good man. Showed the Japs a
thing or two.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Sure did. Dropped the big one on them.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Dropped two big ones. Real fighter. You’re
in the insurance line, Harry?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Well, I’m fully covered.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I don’t doubt it, Mr. Stanwyk. Actually, my
company is the sub-insurer of the subsidiary carriers of a policy held
by Alan Stanwyk, who I believe is your son.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Yes. Where you from, Harry?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: California. San Berdoo. Utah’s part of my
route. Can I ask you a few questions?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Come on in.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: First, a couple of routine things: are you
and you wife currently alive?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Regulations, Mr. Stanwyk. And you and your
wife, named….</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Velma.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Velma. You and Velma are the parents of Alan
Stanwyk, Beverly Hills, California, executive vice president of Boyd
Aviation?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Check.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Okay. Now, the last time you saw your son
was when?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Oh, about ten days ago.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Ten days ago?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: That’s right. Alan comes by every three
weeks or so.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Isn’t that nice. Since when?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Since he moved to L.A.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Forgive me now for seeming personal, but we
understand that there is a lady friend he sees here in Provo.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: What the hell does this have to do with
insurance?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Trust me, sir. It’s a comprehensive
policy.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Well, you can forget about that lady friend
business, Alan’s the most loyal husband a girl could have. He dotes on
that bride of his.</p>
<p><strong>velma</strong>: Cute young thing, too.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I’m sorry?</p>
<p><strong>velma</strong>: His bride. Cute as a button.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: You’ve met her?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Well, of course we have. He brings her with
him.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Has Alan ever mentioned the name Sally Ann
Cavanaugh?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Has he?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Boy, what the hell’s the matter with
you?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Then he has.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Course he has. That’s his wife.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Of course, his wife’s name is Sally Ann
Cavanaugh?</p>
<p><strong>velma</strong>: Cute thing.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Do you happen to have a picture of Alan and
his wife?</p>
<p><strong>velma</strong>: Oh, we’ve got lots of pictures. Let me show
you some.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: And they’re still married…Alan and Sally
Ann.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Of course they are.</p>
<p><strong>velma</strong>: She’s cute as a button.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: How long have they been married?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: Lets see, it was before he moved to L.A…four
years April.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Mrs. Stanwyk, may I borrow this picture. I
promise to send it back to you. It’s routine, really. The actuarial
people need to —</p>
<p><strong>velma</strong>: Oh, that’s all right, I’ve got lots more.
Want to see the reception?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: No, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>velma</strong>: How about Marvin’s sixty-fifth birthday
party?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Frank told you that?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I overheard it. He thinks you’re completely
out of control, he said he was gonna can you as soon as he got the
story. If I were you, I’d just chuck it, Fletch. Screw him. Let him eat
three full pages on Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: You kidding? I got an unbelievable story
here, Lar. Un-believable. Jesus. It’s the cops, I know it. The Chief!
And they’re all over Frank.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I just thought…sure. Sally Ann Cavanaugh.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Check every hotel in L.A. Start with the
ones near the airport. Yeah. He’s about to leave the country with her.
Thanks, Lar.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: ‘welluh bless my soul whatsuh wrong with me?
I’ma itchin’ like a man Inuh fuzzy tree….’</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Yeah…No kidding. The Marriott at LAX.
Sonofabitch…Checked in this morning. Great. Thanks a million. And call
Gail Stanwyk at the Racquet Club. Tell her I have to meet her tonight.
Eight o’clock at the club. Urgent and confidential. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Question:</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Question….</p>
<p><strong>tape recorder</strong>: Day three on the beach. Fat Sam still
hasn’t moved, and —</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: What’s wrong with my life?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Question: Why does a man marry a
millionaire’s daughter in Beverly Hills if he is already married to a
girl who lives in a crappy one bedroom apartment in Utah? Answer: Three
million dollars. Big Question: What’s with Stanwyk and Cummings? I don’t
know. Bigger Question: Why does Stanwyk want me to kill him?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Biggest Question: Why do I eat this sht?
Miss, I believe this has already been eaten.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: I want you to know that dramatic phone
calls about secret meetings scare the sht out of me.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: What’s wrong, Gail?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: I decided I was going to tell my
husband about you today.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: But first I called the Hall of Records
in Provo. They checked on the deed. You’re telling the truth. A minute
later Alan came in the room and asked me why I was shaking.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: So I told him…I told him I was just
cold or something.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: I’ve never lied to him before. It’s
the first time he’s ever lied to me. He was just as convincing as when
he says ‘I love you.’</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I think you better sit down.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: Oh God, I hate things that start like
that….</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Gail, please.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I got this from Alan’s parents. By the way,
they see him all the time.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: What is this….</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I checked. There was no divorce.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: Are you telling me my husband is a
bigamist???</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I’m telling you he’s not your husband at
all.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: And they’re leaving the country tomorrow
night.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: Bastard.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I don’t have all the pieces yet, but I’m
close. I’ll know tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: I’m calling the police. Right now.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: You cant do that.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: Don’t tell me I can’t —</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: They’re trying to kill me!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: Your twenty-four hours are up,
Fletch.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: You’re going to have to trust me, Gail. You
have to. Now listen to me: he’s expecting you to go to your meeting
tomorrow night. Do it. Stay out of the house.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: I’m terrified.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Come here.</p>
<p><strong>surfer cop</strong>: A Sufi junkie.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Gum?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I’m the Sufi.</p>
<p><strong>gummy</strong>: Fletch?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Don’t call me Fletch. Don’t look at me. Lie
back down. We’ll talk.</p>
<p><strong>gummy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Cops are here. I can smell them. They’re
after me. Lie down, Gum.</p>
<p><strong>gummy</strong>: Why are they after you?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Because I’m a newspaper reporter and I’m
nailing Chief Cummings as the source for drugs on the beach. You’re in
big trouble, Gummy.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Sit back down.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Fat Sam is turning state’s evidence.</p>
<p><strong>gummy</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: He wrote me a nice deposition. He says he
just received the drugs. You did the selling.</p>
<p><strong>gummy</strong>: I didn’t sell nothing! I didn’t sell nothing!
I just carried the drugs from the Chief to Sam.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Sure you did.</p>
<p><strong>gummy</strong>: Fletch, I never sold nothing.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Twenty years.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Can’t do a thing with this robe. One more
question, Gum…don’t look at me.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Where does the Chief get the drugs?</p>
<p><strong>gummy</strong>: I dunno. Somewhere in South America, I
forget.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Rio de Janeiro, maybe?</p>
<p><strong>gummy</strong>: Maybe, Fletch. Is that Brazil?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: That’s Brazil.</p>
<p><strong>gummy</strong>: Yeah. Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Wait here for me, Gummy.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: It’s the only way you’ll be safe. Believe
me.</p>
<p><strong>fat sam</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: You don’t know me.</p>
<p><strong>fat sam</strong>: My pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I’m serious, Sam.</p>
<p><strong>fat sam</strong>: What, the heat here?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Affirmative.</p>
<p><strong>fat sam</strong>: The two surfer boys?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Affirmative.</p>
<p><strong>fat sam</strong>: Thought so. What for?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: For me. I’m a reporter, Sam. I’m breaking
the drug story and I got the chief red-handed. Gummy game me a
deposition.</p>
<p><strong>fat sam</strong>: You gonna nail the chief?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I’m gonna nail the chief. And you can help
or —</p>
<p><strong>fat sam</strong>: Oh, I’ll help, Fletch. I’m a slave to that
sonofabitch. He busted me, third offense, gave me a choice: Work for him
or do fifteen long. All I get out of this is free snort.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: You don’t have a piece of the action?</p>
<p><strong>fat sam</strong>: Noooo. Free snort. That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Wait five minutes, and go to my office.
You’ll get federal protection after that.</p>
<p><strong>fat sam</strong>: Gonna need it. That boy is dangerous.
Fletch?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>fat sam</strong>: You find the source?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Gum thought Brazil.</p>
<p><strong>fat sam</strong>: Rio. Know how he gets it in the country?
Some big shot airline executive flies it in on company jets. Very
impressive operation, Fletch. Very impressive.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Fletch….</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I’m quitting, Frank. As of midnight
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: What? Who the hell are they?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: This is Fat Sam, and this is Gummy.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: What….</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Their statements, naming Chief Cummings as
the numero uno drug pusher from here to Oxnard. I want them to have
federal protection under the paper’s sponsorship.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Jesus H. Christ. Fletch, this is the
greatest.</p>
<p><strong>fat sam</strong>: He’s some reporter, this guy.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I’m out, Frank. You lost faith in me.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Fletch, I got nervous. Please….</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I’m going to write the story. Just hold the
last couple of paragraphs till ten o’clock tonight.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Make yourselves comfortable, guys, but don’t
leave the office.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Fletch!</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Fletch, you want an apology?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: You were going to can me, right?</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Not really.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Not really?</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: I was upset.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I’m sick of this place. I’m going to try out
for the Lakers. They need a power forward.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Fletch.</p>
<p><strong>mr. stanwyk</strong>: Good evening.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I like your outfit. You got the fifty grand
and the plane ticket?</p>
<p><strong>mr. stanwyk</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>mr. stanwyk</strong>: Why don’t you check it out for
yourself, Mr. Nugent?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Because I trust you, Alan. By the way, the
name’s Fletcher. I.M. Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the
name Jane Doe.</p>
<p><strong>mr. stanwyk</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Read this, please.</p>
<p><strong>mr. stanwyk</strong>: Wait a second —</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Cut the crap and read it.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Unless my people hear differently, this
letter goes out at midnight.</p>
<p><strong>mr. stanyk</strong>: ‘Dear Sir: Alan Stanwyk murdered me
tonight. The charred remains found by the police in the Jaguar are mine,
not his. Mr. Stanwyk, using my name and passport, boarded Pan Am Flight
306 for Rio, where he intends to establish residence with —’</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Pretty hefty. Keep reading.</p>
<p><strong>mr. stanwyk</strong>: ‘…with his legal wife, the former Sally
Ann Cavanaugh.’</p>
<p><strong>gail’s voice</strong>: Keep reading, Alan.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: Don’t worry, I can take it.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: You shouldn’t be here.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: I want to hear this.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: He doesn’t read my stuff well. ‘Sally Ann
and Alan were married four years ago and never divorced, making Stanwyk
a bigamist even in Utah. Stanwyk is also traveling with three million
dollars in cash, the result of Gail Stanwyk’s conversion of Boyd
Aviation stock. Mrs. Stanwyk believed the money was to be used to
purchase property in Utah, but it wasn’t; a fact that can be confirmed
by realtor James Swarthout of Provo.’ That was stupid, Alan.</p>
<p><strong>mr. stanwyk</strong>: I’d have been long gone.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Ahem. ‘Sally Ann can confirm all this when
the police pick her up at the Airport Marriott.’</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: ‘By the way, Alan is a very big drug
smuggler, but you can read all about that in tomorrow’s paper. Sincerely
yours, I.M. Fletcher. P.S. Have a nice day.’</p>
<p><strong>mr. stanwyk</strong>: Bravo, Mr. Fletcher.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: The thing that really tipped it off for me
was something your wife said to me while we were in bed together.</p>
<p><strong>mr. stanwyk</strong>: And what was that?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: How similar in build you and I are. then I
figured it. You bump me off, throw me in the car, and burn me up.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: My God, Alan, you really are and
ahole, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>mr. stanwyk</strong>: Sorry, darling.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: You sonofabitch.</p>
<p><strong>mr. stanwyk</strong>: Yes, I suppose I am. But I’m not a
stupid sonofabitch.</p>
<p><strong>mr. stanwyk</strong>: I was already prepared to commit one
murder. What makes you think I won’t commit two?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Whoops.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: ‘Whoops?’ What do you mean ‘whoops?’
Don’t say ‘whoops.’</p>
<p><strong>mr. stanwyk</strong>: I mean, by the time your story gets
published, I’ll be on the beach. I understand extradition from Rio is
very complicated. I’ll bet for two murders it’s even more so.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: That is a lighter, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>cummings</strong>: Greetings, everyone.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Thank God, the police.</p>
<p><strong>mr. stanwyk</strong>: What the hell are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>cummings</strong>: Put the gun down, Alan. I’ll take care of
them.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: I thought you had this all figured
out. Good going ‘Irwin.’</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Don’t ever call me ‘Irwin,’ okay?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. stanwyk</strong>: I’ve got it all under control, Jerry.
You can go now.</p>
<p><strong>cummings</strong>: Under control? You idiot. You didn’t know
who he was?</p>
<p><strong>cummings</strong>: Fat Sam left the beach today. So did
Gummy. It began to occur to me that some things are beginning to happen
that maybe I should be aware of.</p>
<p><strong>mr. stanwyk</strong>: I said I’ll take care of it. Now, a man
of your position shouldn’t be a part of what’s about to go down. So go
home and I’ll call you tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>cummings</strong>: What, ‘long distance?’ I couldn’t help but
hear you say something about Rio, Alan. You’re not leaving with the
eight hundred thousand dollars I staked you for the next load, are
you?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Whoa. Well, you two obviously have a lot to
talk over, so we’ll go catch the last ten minutes of Dynasty.</p>
<p><strong>mr. stanwyk</strong>: Jerry, you’re simply going to have to
trust me. I’ve got a foolproof way to get rid of this guy and now you’re
jeopardizing everything.</p>
<p><strong>cummings</strong>: Your ‘foolproof’ way is going to land my a
on the front page while you’re basking in Rio.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: …with your money.</p>
<p><strong>cummings</strong>: This one’s going to be even more fun.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Go ahead. Make my evening.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I’m calling the police. Then I’m leaving.
You wait here for them.</p>
<p><strong>gail</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Away. I think it might take you a while to
get your life back together. You don’t need me around. Don’t go back in
there.</p>
<p><strong>gail</strong>: I really creamed the sonofabitch, didn’t
I?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: You sure did.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Your call is come through.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Far out. Larry? It’s Fletch. Well, it’s not
‘Fat Sam’s’, but…any port in a storm. Oh, tell Frank I need a couple of
months. The fifty grand’s lasting longer than I thought.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: I gotta go, Lar.</p>
<p><strong>gail</strong>: John Ultramalensky, right?</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>gail</strong>: God, I haven’t seen you since the wedding.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Gee, I must have been sht-faced at your
wedding, I don’t —</p>
<p><strong>gail</strong>: Not mine, stupid. Yours.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>gail</strong>: I couldn’t sit home and play the mournful
widow anymore, and the police didn’t need me, so I tried watching a
Lakers game on TV, but the announcer talked to fast and I couldn’t
understand a lot of what was happening, so I figured if I came down here
maybe you could explain the rules to me, and besides, I missed you.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: No problem.</p>
<p><strong>fletch</strong>: Basketball, of course, was invented in
France, and is played with a large ball, two tongue depressors and a
fish….</p>
