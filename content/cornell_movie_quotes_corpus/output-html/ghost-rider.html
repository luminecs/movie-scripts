<p><strong>woman</strong>: My Father used to say that the only way Evil
came into your life was if you invited it. I’m not sure about that, at
least not anymore. What I cLQ know is this: we are born alone, and we
die alone, and what happens in between is all that matters. The choices
we make, the people whose paths we cross – these are the things that
determine our fate. The coyote ducks through a hole in a chain-link
fence, weaves through the rusted ruins of a –</p>
<p><strong>derelict amusement park</strong>: Broken-down rides,
weed-clogged machinery, sideshow trailers bleached bone-white.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Most stories start with a beginning. His
began with an ending. I never knew where he really came from. I guess
it’s not important anymore. All I know is that he’d been running his
entire life. Running for so long that he no longer knew whether he was
running away from</p>
<p><strong>something –</strong>: The coyote reaches a steep ridge, looks
out over a patchy Southwestern town.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: – or towards it.</p>
<p><strong>little mike</strong>: where do you chink you’re going,
Blaze?</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Sick, cutting out early.</p>
<p><strong>little mike</strong>: The hell you are! Blaze jumps on his
bike - a muscular, battered BSA.</p>
<p><strong>little mike</strong>: Get back to work or your ass is
fired!</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Aaa n? You say that every time. Blaze
kicks-starts the bike. It ROARS thunderously.</p>
<p><strong>little mike</strong>: Well I mean it this time!</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: See you tomorrow, Little Mike! The bike
HOWLS, hauls up on its back wheel. Screams out the shop leaving Little
Mike holding his ears. The other workers WHOOP and HOLLER, especially
when Blaze snags a pair of BOLT- CUTTERS from a passing tool rack on the
fly.</p>
<p>****: Skin of your teeth, man!</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Yeah, we’re on a tight schedule!</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: So what are you waiting for? Blaze burns
away, leaving the pickup for dust.</p>
<p><strong>inside the car</strong>: – and lands perfectly, screeching to
a halt. Blaze WHOOPS his exhilaration. And if you don’t believe this,
watch extreme motocross as we CUT TO:</p>
<p><strong>the opposite door</strong>: being wrenched aside, revealing
Coop’s pickup holding steady alongside the train. Jed and Murphy ride
the cargo bed like surfers. Blaze starts tossing boxes out of the car
and into the truck. Jed and Murphy stack <code>em and rack</code>em. We
get glimpses of the loot: CD Players, VCRs, personal packages, luggage
–</p>
<p><strong>jed</strong>: Christ, Mickey was right on the money!</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Car twenty-two!</p>
<p>****: Candy from a baby! The boxes keep coming, like baggage at the
airport. Some boxes miss the mark, fall short, get mangled. A box bursts
against Murphy’s chest, engulfs him in an explosion of paper and
polystyrene beads. The others howl with LAUGHTER, riding high on this
Great Train Robbery as -</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: – Blaze hears something, looks over his
shoulder. He SEES a POLICE CRUISER, far in the distance, burning towards
them.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Thank you gentlemen, that’s it for today! Jed
bangs on the cab roof. Coop waves. Jed and Murphy salute. The pickup
peels away. Blaze retrieves his bike. Stands it back up, kicks it alive,
guns the throttle and – – cold jumps straight out of the car. Seconds
later he’s powering away, ripping up a storm, chasing the pickup towards
the horizon. Far, far behind, the police are still coming.</p>
<p>****: Hon, would you pass me the vegetables. Chuck obliges, takes a
drink of his beer, nods to Blaze.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: So how’re things going at the shop, John?</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Good, good.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Yeah? Cause Mike says you’ve been slacking
off, horsing around.</p>
<p>****: It’s okay, Rox.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Blaze sets his fork down, wipes his
mouth with his napkin. Conjures up his best earnest look.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Truth is, Mr. Simpson, I’ve been thinking
about clearing out of there. Maybe opening up a shop of my own – Roxanne
raises an eyebrow at this. News to her.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: See, I’ve been saving up. You know, for the
baby and all. And I– DOORBELL. Roxanne rises to get it.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: You were saying?</p>
<p>****: Right, so anyway –</p>
<p><strong>john –</strong>: Blaze looks over. Two Sheriff’s Deputies,
LUCAS COLE and RICK GEORGE, are standing in the doorway. Roxanne looks
pissed – like this isn’t the first time this has happened. Blaze stands,
approaches. Clearly, he knows them both.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Lucas. Rick.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Johnny. We’d like you to come down the
station. Their demeanor is hard. Won’t take “no” for an answer.</p>
<p>****: Can I finish eating? Nope. Blaze squirms, feels Roxanne’s eyes
on him. He turns to her, tries to explain.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Don’t worry, hon. It’s just routine –</p>
<p>****: It is by now. Just let me know if you’re staying overnight. She
goes back to her dinner.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Hey. She’s sound asleep. He crouches, touches
her face.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Hey. Roxanne barely stirs, deeply groggy.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Everything’s cool.</p>
<p>****: You’re going to jail.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: No. No. Everything’s okay. Jed and Murph just
got a little boisterous at The Prairie Dog last night. Cops wanted to
read us the riot act, that’s all – She yawns, curls up, starts to drift
away again.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: I was worried about you. And I don’t like
your friends. But Blaze won’t let her go back to sleep. He jostles
her.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Listen, I want to show you something –</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: I’m sure you do. But I’m half-asleep and
you’re an ass-hole.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: I’m serious, Rox. This is important. He drags
her up off the couch. Makes her stand up. She MOANS, scowls, but he gets
her on her feet.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: John, I have to go to work tomorrow</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Put your coat on. You’ll be glad you did.
Promise. It’ll be an adventure. A mystery tour.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: This better be good. She stomps to the
bathroom. Blaze chuckles inwardly. Steals a fortune cookie from the
left-overs, snaps it open – The fortune is blank. Both sides. He tosses
it away.</p>
<p><strong>coyote eyes</strong>: glittering black, watching.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Alright, I’m here. Now what?</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Keep going. It’s just up there.</p>
<p><strong>a broken-down carousel</strong>: Must have been magnificent
in its day.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: I’m not riding one of those stupid
horses.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: You don’t have to ride, just climb up. She
steps up onto the wooden platform, smiles back at him.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: You’re going to have to grow up one day,
Johnny Blaze.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Not if I can help it. He follows her up onto
the ride. She weaves through the wooden animals. Starting to enjoy this
secret adventure.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Keep going, keep going – She comes around the
other side, catches her breath. The whole valley is spread out before
her – a glorious scatter of diamonds on velvet.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Uh-oh.</p>
<p>****: What?</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Ever hear of a carnival wedding? Roxanne
shakes her head. Blaze is fiddling with a crisp, new dollar bill,
folding it, making something.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: If a man and a woman walk around a carousel
going backwards, they’re considered hitched.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: You made that up.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Swear to God. He finishes folding the bill.
The “one” is now neatly set on top of an ORIGAMI WEDDING BAND like a
paper jewel.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: You want this?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: She nods, offering her hand. He slips
the ring onto her finger and she examines it, lit up inside.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: It’s beautiful. He smiles at her joy,
wrestles with what he’s about to say.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: How’d I ever find you?</p>
<p>****: Fate?</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: I don’t believe in fate.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Maybe it believes in you. They hug each
other fiercely. A long, soulful embrace. Blaze looks to the city lights
beneath them once more.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Here’s the thing, John. We’re having a
baby. You can’t keep acting like everything’s a game. I need you with
me. I need to know I’ll be able to wake up in the morning and see your
face next to mine. Not have to worry that you spent the night in
jail.</p>
<p>****: That’s not a life. At least not one I’m interested in
living.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: I know. I’m gonna get my shit together. For
Leal, this time,</p>
<p>****: I promise you, Rox. I’ll always be there for you. She takes his
hand and places it on her belly.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Don’t promise me, promise her.</p>
<p><strong>the coyote</strong>: blinks. THUNDER from the next scene
prelaps as we</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: We gotta go. Get your stuff together.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: What happened? What’s wrong? Roxanne
follows Blaze into the bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: What did you do?</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: I fucked up. The police are coming. Grab your
things. We have to go. She sags, clearly been through this before. He
tosses a suitcase onto the bed, looks back at her.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Just do it, Rox!</p>
<p><strong>following blaze</strong>: as he storms into the bathroom.
Reaches behind the high cistern, retrieves a hidden HANDGUN. He jumps
down. Tears the side panel off the old bath tub. There’s a stack of FLAT
BLACK BOXES hidden within. Blaze drags them out, drops one - It pops
open, spilling UNCUT DIAMONDS all over the floor. Blaze CURSES,
struggles to gather up the loot.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Jesus, Johnny –</p>
<p><strong>on roxanne</strong>: standing in the doorway. She sawit
all.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Fuck.</p>
<p><strong>blaze’s rear-view mirror pov:</strong>: The cop car is
turning, heading back in their direction.</p>
<p><strong>john –</strong>: Blaze floors the gas. The speedometer
leaps.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Slow down, John – Another sketchy turn.
Blaze spins the wheel, brakes, hard. Too hard. The car hydroplanes,
finds purchase –</p>
<p><strong>slow down!</strong>: LIGHTNING flashes, and suddenly, there’s
a</p>
<p><strong>coyote</strong>: or, the road, right in their path.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Blaze jerks the wheel. Roxanne SCREAMS.
The car skids, slews off the road, CRASHES through a guard rail – It
plunges down a washout, flips end over end, shedding glass and wreckage,
finally SLAMMING to a dead stop at the bottom of a rocky arroyo.</p>
<p><strong>inside the el camino</strong>: Blaze stirs, blood streaming
down his face. The windshield is blown open. Rain pours in.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Roxanne –? He struggles to free himself from
his seat, SEES a torn seat ty.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Roxanne?!</p>
<p><strong>on roxanne</strong>: lying ten yards away, unconscious, maybe
dead. Blaze scrambles to her, rolls her over. He hauls her into his
arms, SOBBING, the two of them covered in mud and glass and God knows
what.</p>
<p><strong>troopers</strong>: are coming down the incline, guns drawn,
FLASHLIGHTS beaming. They descend on Blaze, crying to pull him free of
Roxanne.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Let me see her! God-Dammit! I have a right to
see her –</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Get your fucking hands off me! Lucas Cole,
the deputy who questioned Blaze earlier, approaches. Blaze SEES him and
calms down a little.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Please. Just let me see her. Cole nods to his
men, who ease up on Blaze. He guides Blaze over to an observation window
–</p>
<p><strong>their pov</strong>: Roxanne lays in a surgery bay, DOCTORS
and NURSES milling around her.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Mr. Blaze –? Blaze turns, SEES a nervous
DOCTOR standing behind him.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Is she going to make it?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Mr. Blaze, I –</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: _a ch= going r4 make i r?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: We don’t know. She’s critical. Her injuries
are grave. There’s a real chance she won’t –</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: What about the baby? The doctor hesitates,
glances at Cole.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: I’m so sorry. We did everything we could.
Blaze’s will shatters as the full realization of what he’s done slams
into him. Tears sting his cheeks. Cole gives him space. Whatever
punishment awaits Blaze can’t be any worse than the hell he’s living
through now.</p>
<p><strong>boots</strong>: walk purposefully on linoleum. Passing bay
after bay. Beyond the Troopers, SOMEONE is approaching, half seen
through layers of glass. Blaze HEARS the footsteps, lifts his weary
head. The shadow keeps coming, half-glimpsed between partitions as it
draws near.</p>
<p><strong>the icu lights</strong>: flicker and weaken as if some unseen
force were sapping their intensity. Blaze glances at the machines. Still
ticking –</p>
<p><strong>ambrose starke</strong>: steps into view. Duster-coat. A
wide-brimmed cowboy hat. A smiling stone face. Blue eyes flecked with
silver grey. He steps between the Troopers. They keep talking, don’t
even seem to notice him.</p>
<p><strong>starke</strong>: You look like you could use some help. Blaze
glances at the troopers. They’re still completely unaware of Starke’s
presence. It’s as if Starke and Blaze have somehow stepped a
split-second sideways in time. The lights around them continue to dim.
The second hand on the wall clock stops. An eerie, dreamlike moment –
the wind, the rain, the tree branches tapping against the window
pane.</p>
<p>****: She’s dying. Starke nods, places a COIN in Blaze’s palm.</p>
<p><strong>starke</strong>: If I could help her, would you be willing co
make a deal?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Blaze looks at the coin – gleaming,
golden, embossed with a soaring eagle on one side, a coyote on the
obverse.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: What kind of deal?</p>
<p><strong>starke</strong>: She lives. You work for me. Something about
Starke’s eyes. Commanding and haunting at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: What kind of work? Starke just keeps smiling.
Lays a comforting hand on Blaze’s shoulder as we drift towards Roxanne’s
beeping EEG.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: When I was young, I was told that our souls
wander while we sleep. Sometimes they get lost. Sometimes they never
make it back –</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: – but if they dQ return, they bring messages.
And I guess thhat’s how the dead speak to us – in memories that may be
dreams, and dreams that feel like memories. Blaze turns off the
light.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Just passing through? Nomi nods, uneasy. She
glances over her shoulder, searches out her half-breed daughter –</p>
<p><strong>rain ,</strong>: who is sorting intently through a rack of
cheap toys. The kid is quiet, soulful, old beyond her years.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Where you headed?</p>
<p>****: What?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Where are you headed? Late night, storm like
this –</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: What do you care?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Just asking. He keeps packing. But he knows
she’s trouble.</p>
<p><strong>rain</strong>: I like this. Nomi turns, SEES Rain clutching a
toy – a glow-in-the-dark Halloween skeleton.</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: It’s too much, baby. Put it back. I don’t have
enough money for that. Rain stares right at Nomi – and brazenly slips
the doll into her coat pocket. Nomi glances at the Clerk. He didn’t
notice.</p>
<p><strong>carrigan</strong>: Yeah, I found her. Came back to be with
her dying grandpappy.</p>
<p><strong>on the other side of the lot</strong>: BILLY-RAY CARRIGAN
paces under an tire bay awning, talking on a cell-phone. He’s handsome,
charming, but there’s evil lurking within that slick exterior. A pencil-
thin scar runs just under one eye.</p>
<p><strong>carrigan</strong>: Don’t worry. She’s got the kid with her.
Carrigan watches Nomi and Rain climb into the pickup. The pickup chokes
to life, carves out of the lot. Carrigan nods</p>
<p><strong>to –</strong>: – LANDSDALE , a stone-faced criminal, who
motions to five other thugs lounging nearby – FUSCO, ALBRIGHT,
CHUDACOFF, LLOYD and ODELL.</p>
<p><strong>carrigan</strong>: I remember the deal. Just make sure you
bring the money. He hangs up, follows his men to a couple of trucks
waiting nearby – a dusty Tundra for Albright, Chudacoff, Odell and
Lloyd; an old Bronco for Landsdale, Fusco and Carrigan. Carrigan pulls a
Glock from his waistband, chambers a round.</p>
<p><strong>carrigan</strong>: Who wants to be a millionaire? Landsdale
smiles back, an awful smile.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Some people are born bad. That’s just the way
they come into the world. Something goes wrong. Something breaks inside
of them – The trucks pull away, tires ploughing muddy tracks, passing
two STRAY DOGS fighting over a bloody road-kill carcass.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: – and they spend the rest of their lives
trying to make up for it. CLICK’ Blaze Curns on the TV, watches a
weather snippet.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: PAN OVER Blaze’s belongings on the
bureau – a duffle bag, old photographs of his previous life with
Roxanne, a collection of blank postcards. Tucked amidst the photos is a
sonogram featuring a ghostly image of an unborn child.</p>
<p><strong>weatherman</strong>: – scattered thunderstorms firing along a
stalled frontal boundary. Damaging winds, hail, and isolated tornadoes
will be possible across the Dakotas and Upper</p>
<p><strong>midwest –</strong>: Blaze unfolds a tattered map and studies
it. The map is crisscrossed with red lines tracing storms from city to
city, along with all sorts of arcane, personal notations. Blaze traces
his finger down to his present location: DEADFALL.</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: Seatbelt. Rain dutifully fastens herself
in.</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: Hey, bug. You hungry? Rain shakes her
head-</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: Want to listen to music? Look, we won’t have
to keep moving around forever, okay? I’ll figure something out. I
promise. Rain looks at her mother. She’s heard it all before- WHAM!
Somebody rams the truck from behind. Rain SCREAMS.</p>
<p><strong>the coyote/eagle coin</strong>: He stares at it ruefully,
then places it on the map and sets it spinning. We get the sense that
this is a ritual he has performed many times before. As we MOVE IN on
the coin –</p>
<p><strong>ext_ road - dusk</strong>: WHAM! The Bronco collides with
Nomi’s door again. Glass shatters- Rain WAILS, terrified. Wind and rain
rush in – BLOWOUT! Front offside tire. Nomi loses it, careens right,
carves off the shoulder into a muddy culvert, SMASHING over rocks,
sagebrush, fence posts and barbed wire – After a few dozen tortured
yards, the pickup shudders to a stop. The Bronco and the Tundra haul up
nearby, engines CHUGGING like hungry beasts.</p>
<p><strong>in the pickup</strong>: Nomi angrily drags her seatbelt off,
snatches a revolver from the glove box. She looks to Rain:</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: Stay here. And lock the doors. Nomi climbs out
into the rain, SLAMS the door. Rain works the locks, but the driver’s
side is all bent up and twisted –</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: Back the fuck off! LANDSDALE comes from left
of nowhere, twists the gun from her hands in one unexpected move. She
spins, SEES Carrigan approaching – and recognizes him instantly.</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: Billy-Ray –?</p>
<p><strong>carrigan</strong>: Well, if it isn’t Little Miss Running
Bear. He grabs her by her hair, shoves the Glock beneath her chin.</p>
<p><strong>carrigan</strong>: Gentlemen, you are looking at one of the
finest pieces of ass I have ever had the good fortune of defiling.</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: Fuck you, Billy –</p>
<p><strong>carrigan</strong>: Now I might just take you up on that,
Nome. Old Billy-Ray’s been getting a little tired shaking hands with the
governor, know what I’m saying?</p>
<p><strong>in the pickup cab</strong>: Landsdale and his men are trying
to get the doors open. Rain scoots to the driver’s side, tries to start
the engine. But the driver’s door is wrenched open and the men are on
her -</p>
<p><strong>landsdale</strong>: Careful with her! Rain is dragged kicking
and screaming from the cab.</p>
<p><strong>on nomi,</strong>: struggling to free herself, desperate to
help her child.</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: Leave her alone! Rain fights like a hellion,
rakes her fingernails across Odell’s face.</p>
<p><strong>odell</strong>: Fuck! SLAP! Landsdale back-hands the little
girl. As she reels, he binds her hands with duct tape, then picks her up
and throws into the Bronco.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Nomi struggles backwards through
rivulets of mud. Carrigan looms over her. All she can do is stare up at
him, glassy and unfocused as rain spatters her face.</p>
<p><strong>carri gan</strong>: Tell you what, Hon. You want your
goddamned divorce so much? He aims the Glock at her face, about to pull
the trigger as –</p>
<p><strong>carrigan</strong>: You can fucking have it! – a GUT-WRENCHING
HOWL cuts through the night, echoing off the canyon walls. Carrigan and
his cronies take a beat, staring through sheets of rain. Silence. Just
the relentless downpour.</p>
<p><strong>odell</strong>: The hell was that? The men glance at each
other, nervous. A THUNDER-QUAKE rumbles, so low and gritty it’ll rattle
your fillings. The men look around, frightened. Rocks fall from the
surrounding butte. Odell looks down. The SOUND is deafening, vibra tine:
the very earth. And that’s when it happens:</p>
<p><strong>a flaming red-hot monster-cycle</strong>: leaps from atop a
wedged outcrop, ridden by SOMETHING that SCREAMS and BURNS. Silent SLOW
MOTION. Heat haze, glowing manifolds. The bike catches twenty feet of
air, trailing fire like a comet’s tail as it passes right over their
disbelieving heads. What. The. Fuck. Touchdown. A BLAST-WAVE of heat and
flame billow outward. The men shield themselves, stumbling backwards.
The bike hauls a deep carving turn, peeling mud, slides to a dead stop,
hissing in the driving rain. Time stands still. Carrigan and his men
gape. The monster cycle throbs.</p>
<p><strong>on the rider</strong>: Alive. Evil. Aflame. A man but not a
man – an impossible spectre, engulfed in fire, its skullish head deeply
bowed. Clinking coils of red-hot chain slip link by link through its
skeletal, flickering fingers. Then it lifts his terrible</p>
<p><strong>the face of john blaze</strong>: Skeletal, aflame, but
somehow still Johnny, his tortured visage recognizable even as the
furnace blazes blue-white. His jaw bone pivots open to unleash an
INHUMAN HOWL, at once predatory and tormented, a shriek of eternal
damnation. Time speeds up again. The men run. The Ghost Rider
accelerates from zero to sixty in a heartbeat. Lloyd runs fast as he
can. Talk about pointless. The Ghost Rider seizes his head, drags him
seventy yards, burning him black, discarding him – The other men let
rip. Guns blaze. BULLETS punch through the Ghost Rider, coming out his
back as red hot slag. The demon hauls a deep curve, powers up onto his
rear wheel –</p>
<p><strong>albright</strong>: What the fuck?! WHAT THE FUCK?! Albright
FIRES his shotgun. THUNDERING past like an Amtrak train, the Ghost Rider
PUNCHES a flaming fist right through Albright’-, face. That’s it for the
others. They scramble for the trucks. WHOOSH! The Ghost Rider lashes out
with his chains, lassos Chudacoff. He SCREAMS as the metal sears his
body, falls heavily, burning – The Ghost Rider skids to a halt, summons
something internal and lets it loose – a blast of PURE HELLFIRE that
courses down the chains and engulfs Chudacoff, immolating him. The men
make the trucks, pile in. Landsdale slams the Tundra into drive. The big
truck hauls away. Carrigan fights to get the Bronco into gear. Rain
peeks out from the back, eyes bugging –</p>
<p><strong>rain’s pov</strong>: as the Ghost Rider dismounts, stalks
through the rain towards them. He raising his skeletal hand, clenches
it, and suddenly we are –</p>
<p><strong>inside the bronco’s engine</strong>: A series of MACRO SHOTS
as we move amongst the pistons, cylinders, and intake manifolds. The
mixture of vaporized fuel and air within the engine begins to ignite,
but then the miniature explosions seem to contract and implode in upon
themselves and we are –</p>
<p><strong>back outside</strong>: with Carrigan. His truck won’t start.
Somehow, the ?host Rider has actin uished the flames within his engine.
The Ghost Rider keeps coming, his skeletal claws/fingers white-hot now,
throbbing with heat. He slices through the Bronco’s door like a human
oxy-acetylene torch, chopping the vehicle apart. Carrigan panics, drags
Rain out the passenger door. But Fusco is still trapped inside. Can’t
get his seatbelt off. The Ghost Rider tears open the roof, bisects the
vehicle and HURLS the front away, leaving Fusco cowering in the melted
back seat. The Ghost Rider looms over Fusco, extending a skeletal claw
–</p>
<p><strong>fusco</strong>: Oh God, please, I ain’t nothing to do with
nothin’. I ain’t nothin’. Please,</p>
<p><strong>on carrigan</strong>: tugging Rain away from the horror,
trying to ignore Fusco’s terrible SCREAMS. He looks back, wishes he
hadn’t – The Ghost Rider has Fusco snatched up nose-to-nose, forcing the
man to look right into –</p>
<p><strong>the ghost rider’s eyes</strong>: Hungry black sockets that
suck the fire from the air.</p>
<p><strong>fusco</strong>: shudders, eyes bulging. All he can do is
stare into those awful pits, fall into them, as grisly IMAGES from his
evil past spark and shred into his melting mind. Every act of violence,
every crime he ever committed – beatings, murders, acts of torture and
revenge – are now revisited upon Fusco tenfold. This is the PENANCE
STARE, and Fusco is feeling it’s full, hellish force. The Ghost Rider
and Fusco SCREAM in sync. Carrigan and Rain can’t look away. They stand
transfixed – Then it’s over. The Ghost Rider drops Fusco into the mud.
He lies there, shuddering, glassy-eyed, burned black but still alive,
his brain irrevocably overloaded. And The Ghost Rider is somehow
different too. Immobile. Internal. Then he looks up, past Carrigan.
R;rht at. Rain. Rain stares back. But it’s –</p>
<p><strong>blaze’s face</strong>: she SEES. An abject abyss of pain and
shame and torment. And Rain’s terror is forgotten for just that moment,
replaced with something best described as empathy.</p>
<p><strong>light and noise</strong>: to the Ghost Rider’s left. He turns
– the Tundra screams out of nowhere, slamming into him at sixty
plus.</p>
<p><strong>inside the cab</strong>: LANDSDALE ducks the shattering
windshield, leaps from the truck as it fills with fire – The Tundra
keeps moving, pile-drives the howling spectre square into a massive
boulder. The truck compresses like an accordion, EXPLODES, engulfs the
rock with fire – Landsdale picks himself up, ready for anything.
Carrigan tugs Rain over. The wreckage burns out of control.</p>
<p><strong>carrigan</strong>: Did you kill it –?</p>
<p><strong>lands dale</strong>: Fuck if I know!!! Just then, Nomi’s
pickup backs into view. Odell is driving. Ca___gan snatches Rain up like
baggage, starts forward.</p>
<p><strong>on nomi</strong>: dazed, in a muddy gully. She scrambles up
to the lip, SEES the burning Tundra nearby, SEES her pickup hauling away
into the night. She WAILS, tries to drags herself to her feet – CREAK.
The burning wreckage moves. Moves again. Nomi ducks down, watches,
uncomprehending. The crumpled truck is hurled aside. Two tons. Tipped
over like a packing crate. Nomi slips down into the gully, gasping with
fear. HEAVY FOOTSTEPS and CRACKLING FIRE draw near – Nomi dares to look
up. The Ghost Rider stares down at her. Like Death itself. Imagine
yourself face to face with a Great White, an unfathomable, impenetrable
force of nature – Then imagine that force turning away, sparing you. The
world exhales. After a moment Nomi dares to look again:</p>
<p><strong>nomi’s pov</strong>: All she sees is a MAN, in tattered
clothes, rolling a busted up motorcycle away into the darkness.</p>
<p><strong>on blaze,</strong>: stumbling through the crowded ward, head
down, in obvious pain. OR. QUINLAN , struggles to keep up, filling out
paperwork on the fly.</p>
<p><strong>quinlan</strong>: Sir, you have to tell me your name.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: I just need to sit down for a moment. And I
need some forceps, gauze, tape –</p>
<p><strong>quinlan</strong>: I’ll decide what you need, alright? Name?
Blaze hauls a curtain aside, finds an empty surgery bay, prepped and
ready to go.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: SHOUTING MEDICS tear past, pushing a
SCREAMING BURN VICTIM on a gurney. Blaze ducks into the curtained bay.
Quinlan follows.</p>
<p><strong>quinlan</strong>: Sir, I can’t help you if you don’t
cooperate. Are you on something? Drugs? Blaze pulls at his jacket,
easing it over his battered body.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: No, no. Do I look like troub-unghhh – He
grimaces as the jacket comes off. Bullet wounds, shotgun damage, torn
flesh, and a lot of BLOOD.</p>
<p>****: Oh – my. What happened to you? Blaze sits back on the bed, sets
about cleaning his wounds with tools laid out on a tray nearby.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Motorcycle accident. Couple abrasions, maybe
some rib fractures – Just step back, I’ll handle it –</p>
<p><strong>quinlan</strong>: Those are bullet holes. Blaze cleans the
wounds she’s referring to, grits his teeth as he swabs gauze deep into
his flesh.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Nah. They’re just – gouges. Surface damage.
They’ll heal up fine. Ungh - do you have any – painkillers?</p>
<p>****: This was no motorcycle accident. Somebody has cauterized your
wounds Blaze inserts the forceps into a particularly nasty wound.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Percocet? Vicodin, maybe?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Blaze pulls a vicious shard of metal out
of his side, stifles a SCREAM, fights to keep it together.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Just. Give. Me. Something. For. The. Pain. He
staunches the blood, fixing her with such a stone stare that she
involuntarily backs away.</p>
<p><strong>quinlan</strong>: I’m sorry – but I need to report this. Stay
right there. Quinlan backs out through the curtain. Blaze sighs, tapes a
thick gauze patch over the wound, eyes hunting. He SEES a drug cabinet,
breaks into it. Fills his pockets.</p>
<p><strong>on blaze,</strong>: backing into a quiet corner. He
suppresses a sob, fumbling a hypodermic as he fills it with stolen
morphine. He jabs the spike into his leg, sags as the drug takes effect.
After a moment, Blaze calms, gets his bearings, notices that he’s
leaning against a bulletin board on which is pinned –</p>
<p><strong>a wanted poster,</strong>: helpfully illustrated with a
mug-shot of Blaze’s own face. Blaze tears the poster down, stuffs it in
his pocket, then realizes that SOMEONE is watching him. He turns, SEES
–</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: sitting on a nearby bed. Beaten, bruised,
desolate. A PAIR OF STATE TROOPERS are questioning her. She stares past
them, straight at Blaze. She recognizes him.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Ice water floods Blaze’s veins. He
hurries away.</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: You were there last night.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: when they took my daughter.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: I don’t know what you’re talking about</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: Yes you do. Blaze tries to pass off his unease
with an ill-conjured smile. He pushes past her, moving to his battered
motorcycle. Nomi follows.</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: The Ghost Rider. It walked right past me. It
let me live. I know what you are. Blaze stares at Nomi, shaken.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Lady, you don’t know shit. Now bark the fuck
o t of my Ii Blaze mounts his bike, kicks it alive, leaves Nomi in the
dust.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Prairie grasslands roll away on either
side of the two lane blacktop. But Blaze’s landscape is deep within and
dark, dominated by the thunderheads of last night’s horror. He notches
the throttle up a little, cruises at ninety. Rolls his head back, lets
the wind stream over his face. Then he hears ANOTHER MOTORCYCLE. Blaze
looks back –</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: pulls alongside Blaze, riding a monster bike
of her own. Blaze burns away. But Nomi’s no slouch. She matches his
speed and is back beside him moments later. She SHOUTS:</p>
<p><strong>pull over! i need to talk to you!</strong>: Blaze guns the
bike again, jinks around an oncoming station wagon that blares it’s
HORN_ But Nomi’s still on him –</p>
<p><strong>lady, i’ve helped you enough!</strong>: Nomi smiles. Blaze
just slipped up and they both know it.</p>
<p><strong>i thought that was the ghost rider!!!</strong>: Angry with
himself, Blaze throttles his bike to the max, howling over the next rise
on his back wheel, probably hitting one-fifteen as he vanishes from
view. Nomi skids to a stop on the shoulder and waits, her engine
RUMBLING. Wind blows. Lizards click. After a long beat, Blaze reappears.
Stops far away on the crest of the rise. Stares at her.</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: I knew what you were the moment I saw you. I
can help you – jf you’re willing to help mp-. I know things.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: This thing that’s riding you, the Ghost Rider.
I guess it has a lot of names. But the one I grew up hearing was nagi
ocanl sice. It means the Spirit of Vengeance.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: You actually believe what you’re telling
me?</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: You kidding? I’m pure-bred Dakota. I can hear
the mountains talking to each other. And I saw you light up those pricks
like Chinese New Year last night. They reach the trailer. Nomi fixes
glaze with a stare.</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: what do you see when you sleep at night? The
dead? The faces of the people you’ve taken?</p>
<p>****: J,t takes them. Not me. Nomi nods, not sure she believes him.
Enters the trailer.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Does your grandfather understand English?</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: He understands. He just refuses to speak it.
Laforte continues to ramble intermittently. Blaze shifts, impatient,
finally sits forward.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Listen, I don’t want to be an ass-hole, but
can we just fast-forward the whole Yoda routine? The home team scores!
Laforte WHOOPS wildly, loses his mask, COUGHS uncontrollably. Blaze
stands. He’s out of there.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Feel better, old man.</p>
<p><strong>laforte</strong>: Give me the coin. Blaze stops, cocks an
eyebrow at Nomi. She shrugs. Blaze hands over the coin. Laforte studies
it, starts speaking in Dakota again. Nomi translates:</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: The man you’re looking for goes by lots of
names. Coyote, Black Dog. In Dakota, he’s Waka Sica. The Trickster. Look
at him straight on, you might see a human. Look at him out of the corner
of your eye at one of the in-between times – dusk or dawn, you might see
something else.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: What does he want?</p>
<p><strong>laforte</strong>: Wacokico. Vengeance.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: Because it’s his nature. Laforte elaborates.
Nomi continues to translate.</p>
<p><strong>nom i</strong>: Long ago, Coyote could change his shape, chop
his body into little pieces, causing all sorts of mischief.</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: But Eagle, he had a clear eye. And he saw
Coyote for what he really was. So he swooped down, scattered those
pieces to the winds. The first men, they found the pieces, and not
knowing what they were, they ate them. And that’s, how all men came to
have a little piece of Coyote in their hearts. Now Coyote, he’ll promise
anything to get those pieces back. There it is. Blaze exhales. He
studies Laforte, those ancient, wise eyes.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: I’ve been looking for this man for five years
now, storm-chasing – Tracked him halfway across the country. How do I
make him lift the curse?</p>
<p><strong>laforte</strong>: Ta ocanzeke kin akta a’ikoyake. T’e sniya
kel rrrani. Takuni a’ikoyake sni ya’un kte hantana, wocanzeke kin
ekignaka yo!</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: My grandfather says you’ve been looking in the
wrong place. You need to look inward. The Ghost Rider is Starke’s
weapon. An extension of his rage. But it can’t ride people unless it has
something to latch onto in the first place. You understand? Blaze nods.
He thinks he does. Laforte hands the coin back, returns his attention to
the game. But as Blaze starts to rise, Laforte says one final thing:</p>
<p><strong>laforte</strong>: Wee-cha-sha nee-shee-cha hay? Nomi pauses,
deciding how to phrase what the old man said.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: What? What’d he say?</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: He wants to know if you’re a bad man. If the
Ghost Rider turned its penance stare on you, would you burn?</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Why don’t you just go to the police?</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: I did. But I’m red. They said they’ll “look
into it”. Truth is, I’ve had a few run-ins with them myself.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Your daughter – why does Starke want her?
Nomi takes a beat, looks away. Haunted, ashamed.</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: Because he’s her father. And he wants her
back. Billy-Ray and the others, they’re being paid to take her to him.
Blaze nods. Things are falling into place now.</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: Look, I believe things happen for a reason.
Call it fate, karma, whatever you want – but there’s no way our paths
crossing was just blind luck. I need your help, Blaze.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Just so you understand what you’re asking,
this thing inside me – I can’t control it. It just comes out. And when
it does, it’s like I’m a prisoner in my own body. There’s no reasoning
with it. It doesn’t have a conscience. It doesn’t even have a
personality. It’s just a –</p>
<p>****: – hunger.</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: You’re looking for Starke. I’m looking for my
kid. We find one, we’ll find the other.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: And then –?</p>
<p>****: And then I don’t care about the rest.</p>
<p><strong>a powerful dust storm</strong>: Raging full force. Blinding
dust and debris batter closing store fronts. Roof sheeting tears away,
street lamps rattle, hapless LOCALS struggle to get indoors. A lone
coyote lopes through the havoc, trotting purposefully against the wind,
dodging cars, ducking flying boards and planks. The animal passes under
a sign: “HOWARDSVILLE CAR</p>
<p><strong>close on a man’s mouth</strong>: Lupine. Carnivorous.
Speaking into a payphone handset.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Is she comfortable? Are you feeding her
properly?</p>
<p>****: She’s alright, I guess. Quiet.</p>
<p><strong>back to the coyote</strong>: running between rows of rental
cars.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Does she know where you’re taking her?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I think she’s figured it out.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: And how does she feel about that?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: How the hell should I know?</p>
<p><strong>carrigan</strong>: I’m not a psychologist. She’s a fucking
freak, alright? Always has been. Sooner I get her out of my sight, the
better.</p>
<p><strong>the coyote</strong>: approaches the phone booth situated
beside the rental office. Inside the booth, the man is half-seen.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: She’s the most important thing in your life,
Carrigan. Make sure she arrives safely.</p>
<p>****: And be careful. She’ll kill if she gets the chance. The man
hangs up, turns to look at the coyote staring up at him. Once again, we
meet –</p>
<p><strong>ambrose starke</strong>: Same sky-blue eyes flecked with
metal. Starke and Coyote stare at each other, indifferent to the storm
raging around them- He starts towards the rental office.</p>
<p><strong>weatherman</strong>: – experiencing extraordinary conditions.
Tornadoes blanketing much of East Texas, with reports of extensive
damage and gusts of up to seventy miles per hour – As Pecrowsky turns
off the TV, we hear the door CHIME. Starke enters, bringing a strong
gust of wind with him.</p>
<p><strong>petrowsky</strong>: Sorry, guy, I’m just closing up. Starke
looks to a clock on the wall – it’s 4:55.</p>
<p><strong>starke</strong>: According to the hours posted outside,
you’re still open.</p>
<p>****: Look, Mister, in case you hadn’t noticed, there’s a storm
coming – tornadoes, whatever. I’m trying to get out of here. Starke
fixes Petrowsky with a stern gaze.</p>
<p><strong>starke</strong>: I would like to rent a car – – “Jim” .
Something in Starke’s tone gives Petrowsky pause. He glances to the
window and the growing storm beyond. We SEE the coyote out there,
watching from across the way.</p>
<p>****: Okay, alright, have a seat. Starke sits. Petrowsky moves behind
his desk.</p>
<p><strong>petrowsky</strong>: Now, Mr. –?</p>
<p><strong>starke</strong>: Starke. First name, Ambrose.</p>
<p><strong>petrowsky</strong>: Starke, okay. What kind of car were you
looking for? Starke picks up a laminated placard featuring various
cars.</p>
<p><strong>starke</strong>: What about the Cadillac Deville? I noticed
you had one in your lot outside.</p>
<p><strong>petrowsky</strong>: Sorry, already spoken for. How `bout a
full-size car? I can give you a Chevy Malibu, Ford Taurus – Starke
deliberates. Outside, the storm seems to grow stronger. Petrowsky shifts
in his seat, trying to mask his impatience. Were he observant enough, he
might also notice that the wall clock has stopped.</p>
<p><strong>petrowsky</strong>: You want the Taurus? Give you a good
deal, mid-size price. $37.99 a day, can’t beat that.</p>
<p><strong>starke</strong>: I had my heart set on the Cadillac, Jim.</p>
<p>****: Caddy’s taken. Now look, I’m trying to be accommodating here,
but I really am in a hurry. So what’s it going to be? Another beat as
Starke stares Petrowsky down. Gradually, the lights in the office begin
to dim.</p>
<p><strong>starke</strong>: The Taurus, then.</p>
<p><strong>petrowsky</strong>: Great. Can I see a driver’s license?
Starke reaches into his jacket, handing over a license. Petrowsky types
in the required information, trying to ignore the vague feeling of
uneasiness settling over him.</p>
<p><strong>petrowsky</strong>: How many days do you need it for?</p>
<p><strong>starke</strong>: Two, three –</p>
<p><strong>petrowsky</strong>: Any other drivers?</p>
<p><strong>starke</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>petrowsky</strong>: And you’ll be paying by –?</p>
<p><strong>starke</strong>: Cash.</p>
<p><strong>petrowsky</strong>: I’ll need a three hundred dollar deposit.
Starke nods, removing a money clip from his jacket, deftly sliding out
three crisp, brand-new hundred dollar bills.</p>
<p><strong>petrowsky</strong>: What about refueling? We’ve got three
options. You can purchase a full tank in advance, you can fill it up
yourself before you return it, or you can have us do it, but then we
have to charge you four dollars a gallon. Most people go for the tank in
advance. Less hassle.</p>
<p><strong>starke</strong>: I’ll do it myself.</p>
<p><strong>petrowsky</strong>: Okey-dokey. Petrowsky enters the final
data, hits “PRINT”. As the rental agreement begins feeding out, we hear
a HORN FiONK. Starke turns. A mini-van has pulled up outside. A MOUSY
WOMAN sits behind the wheel. A BOY sits in the back seat. The coyote is
still there, but it pays no attention to them.</p>
<p><strong>starke</strong>: Mrs. Petrowsky?</p>
<p><strong>petrowsky</strong>: Yeah. Petrowsky slides the agreement to
Starke, takes out a pen:</p>
<p><strong>petrowsky</strong>: Here you go. Just your standard rental
agreement. You get up to 150 miles a day for free, twenty cents a mile
after that. If you want additional personal accident insurance it’s five
dollars a day, another nine-ninety-nine if you want the loss/damage
waiver. Your basic rental rate, plus applicable state and local tax. You
just need to initial here, here, and here – – and give me your John
Hancock on the line right here. Petrowsky offers Starke a pen. He
doesn’t take it. Instead, he pulls out a pair of bifocals. With
agonizing slowness, Starke begins to peruse the rental agreement.</p>
<p><strong>petrowsky</strong>: Is there a o oblem –?</p>
<p><strong>starke</strong>: The price you quoted was $37,99, the mid-
size rate. But you’ve listed the daily rate here as $62.99.</p>
<p><strong>petrowsky</strong>: I did? Starke turns the agreement around
for Petrowsky to see.</p>
<p><strong>petrowsky</strong>: Geez, I’m sorry, you’re absolutely right.
That’s the Caddy rate. Guess I entered it in by mistake – Starke looks
up at Petrowsky over the rim of his bifocals, the timbre of his voice
taking on a decidedly frigid turn.</p>
<p><strong>starke</strong>: Were you trying to cheat me, Jim?</p>
<p><strong>petrowsky</strong>: No, no, not at all –</p>
<p><strong>starke</strong>: Then I’d like a new contract specifying the
appropriate rate. Petrowsky squirms, uncomfortable. For in that pregnant
moment, without either participant uttering at word, the entire nature
of the transaction seems to have changed.</p>
<p><strong>petrowsky</strong>: Look, can’t we just go with the contract
we’ve got here? I’ll make a note of it and knock a day’s rental off the
total when you return it. What do you say?</p>
<p><strong>starke</strong>: I say the Devil’s in the details.</p>
<p><strong>petrowsky</strong>: Jesus – Jesus –</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: There’ve been times in my life when the world
seemed so hateful and vindictive that I just wanted to die – Helen
Petrowsky bolts from the mini-van. The boy watches as his mother rushes
to her husband’s side.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Jim?! Jim, what happened?! Petrowsky clutches
at his wife’s arm, trying to speak. A shard of glass has penetrated his
larynx.</p>
<p><strong>petrowsky</strong>: – H-helen – get – a–away – Petrowsky’s
eyes widen in horror. Helen follows his gaze</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Certain twists of that fate felt like nothing
more than God’s spite.</p>
<p><strong>starke</strong>: strides towards them, his face a veil of
unmerciful contempt. The dust storm has taken on Biblical proportions,
whipping and roiling around him, becoming an extension of his fury. He
snatches Helen up by the throat, snapping her neck with inhuman
strength, flings her lifeless body to the ground – then he brings his
boot heel down on Petrowsky’shead. crushing it like an _aashell.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: It was obvious to me that I’d done something
wrong. Broken some secret rule known only to Him. And as such, would be
punished for my sins – Starke turns now, regarding the mini-van. The boy
is nowhere in sight. He approaches, looks inside. The boy has fled.</p>
<p><strong>boy’s pov</strong>: Looking right, then left. No sign of
Starke. The Boy shudders, truing to stifle his sniveling. Then –</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: But I had it all wrong. And I see that now,
with such clarity I sometimes feel my heart will break –</p>
<p><strong>the coyote</strong>: appears, creeping along a parallel
aisle. It pauses, lowering its snout, peering at the boy from afar. The
Boy freezes. FOOTSTEPS approaching. He squirms around for a better view
–</p>
<p><strong>boy’s pov</strong>: We SEE Starke’s boot heels a few dozen
yards away, gradually closing in on the car beneath which the Boy hides.
The Boy shuts his eyes. The FOOTSTEPS draw closer, then stop. The Boy
opens his eyes. Starke’s hoots are just an arm’s length away.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: There’s a world out there that’s neither
right nor wrong. Neither kind nor cruel. Fair or unfair. It simply is..
Existing in all it’s bliss and pain.</p>
<p><strong>a hand</strong>: slips under the body of the car.Butit’s not
a human hand. It’s the hand of a beast – blackandtwisted, taloned. With
a sudden movement, the hand flipsthecar up, sending the enter vehicle
spiraling into theair.The Boy lies there, exposed like a bug beneath an
upturned rock. He looks up –</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: And what seems like cruel fate is really only
Nature, red in tooth and claw.</p>
<p><strong>the boy’s pov</strong>: We see a BRIEF FLASH of Starke. No
longer a human silhouette, but a SNARLING, lupine beast. The Trickster.
The Black Dog. Rushing towards us with open jaws as we –</p>
<p><strong>odell</strong>: Want some food, kid? Rain doesn’t respond.
Odell rustles the bag.</p>
<p><strong>odell</strong>: C’mon. Eat a chip or something.</p>
<p><strong>carrigan</strong>: She’s not gonna eat, Odell. Just shut up
and get some sleep.</p>
<p><strong>odell</strong>: I can’t sleep. Every time I close my eyes, I
see the face of that thing, Lloyd</p>
<p><strong>burning –</strong>: – Christ.</p>
<p><strong>carrigan</strong>: Just put it out of your head.</p>
<p><strong>odell</strong>: If I could put it out of my head, I wouldn’t
be awake now, would I? Landsdale stirs. Carrigan gestures at the barren
landscape.</p>
<p><strong>carrigan</strong>: Look out there, what do you see?</p>
<p><strong>landsdale</strong>: Dick.</p>
<p><strong>carrigan</strong>: That’s right. Miles and miles of nothing.
And there’s a lot of weird shit running around in that nothing. How many
people you know seen a UFO, huh? Ten? Twenty? Hell, it’s on every
goddamn paper at the supermarket. You believe that shit, the whole
country’s being overrun by those bug-eyed motherfuckers.</p>
<p><strong>landsdale</strong>: Probe you in the ass, they get the
chance.</p>
<p><strong>odell</strong>: What’s your point, Mr. Serling?</p>
<p><strong>carrigan</strong>: My point is; everybody’s seen somethina.
Ghosts, aliens, Bigfoot, whatever –</p>
<p><strong>odell</strong>: This wasn’t no freaking Bigfoot! You see what
it did to Albright? Punched his head clean off!</p>
<p><strong>carrigan</strong>: Look, I don’t know what that thing was.
All I know is, Starke’s paying us a butt- load of money to deliver the
kid to him. We were told we’d see things and we were told to look the
other way. You want to cut out? I’ll pull over right here.</p>
<p><strong>landsdale</strong>: Keep your shirt on, B. We didn’t come
this far just to limp home with nothing. Right, Odell? Odell settles
back into his seat, uneasy.</p>
<p><strong>odell</strong>: I guess. But I’d still like to know what that
thing was.</p>
<p><strong>rain</strong>: He’s the Ghost Rider. Everybody looks at her.
It’s the first thing she’s said.</p>
<p>****: “The Ghost Rider”? Get that off the back of an Oakridge Boys
album or something? You think that shit scares me?</p>
<p><strong>rain</strong>: It should. He’s going to kill you all.</p>
<p>****: See? SiE? !</p>
<p><strong>odell</strong>: That’s what I’m talking about! Fucking Chatty
Cathy sitting back here with me! Carrigan glances in the rear-view
mirror, makes eye-contact with Rain, does his level-best not to be
spooked.</p>
<p><strong>blaze and nomi,</strong>: riding their cycles. Up ahead is a
postal truck. Blaze HONKS, waves to the DRIVER. He’s got a postcard in
his hand. He hands it to the driver through the open door, then
decreases his speed, falling back alongside Nomi. As they scream over a
hill, we SEE the White Buffalo Indian Casino and Lodge in the
distance.</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: I don’t like this. I spent the last six years
trying to forget this place.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: You got any idea where Billy-Ray might be
headed?</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Then we should start with where he’s
been.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Your husband used to work here?</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: Billy-Ray dealt blackjack, poker. Worked the
casino circuit. We met in Vegas. Things kind of went downhill after
that.</p>
<p><strong>rodenburg</strong>: Got a lot of nerve showing your face here
again.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: They turn. Chief of Security, VINCE
RODENBURG , storms towards them, flanked by TWO SECURITY GOONS.</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: Believe me, Vince, this is the last place I
want to be. But we need to find Billy- Ray. He took Rain.</p>
<p><strong>rodenburg</strong>: Sorry’ The Deal Man hasn’t been back in
weeks. You have a nice day now.</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: But you must’ve talked to him. Do you know
where he’s headed? Just tell me that.</p>
<p><strong>rodenburg</strong>: What am I? His babysitter? I don’t know
where he is, Nome, and if I did, I sure as hell wouldn’t be telling you.
Show these two ass-holes to the door.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Look, this is important. We’re talking about
a kidnapping.</p>
<p><strong>rodenburg</strong>: We are? And who is ?</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: I’m just a friend.</p>
<p><strong>rodenburg</strong>: Ri h t. Nomi tell you what a blue ribbon
slut she was? Do anything to support that needle habit of hers. Truth,
’bout the only person that hasn’t had her around here is me. Blaze steps
forward now, angry, threatening.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: That’s enough.</p>
<p><strong>ro denburg</strong>: What, you gonna get all Steven Segal on
me, tough guy? Pull a fucking Glimmer Man?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Blaze moves, twists Rodenburg’s arm like
rope, wrenches his thumb backwards, SLAMS Rodenburg face-first into one
of those Plexiglas booths where people dive for dollars. The goons pull
their pieces. Blaze just ups the pain.</p>
<p><strong>rodenburg</strong>: -w-w–wait!! ! –oh, fuck, just wait a
second – The goons hesitate. CUSTOMERS stare. Blaze seethes.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: I need you to understand something, Vince. I
am, by nature, an inherently violent man and there’s not much in the way
of bad that I haven’t already inflicted on this miserable world – So
unless the idea of learning to drive a wheelchair with your mouth sounds
appealing, I suggest you apologize to my friend and tell us WHERE THE
FUCK BILLY-</p>
<p><strong>rodenburg</strong>: I don’t know! I don’t know – Blaze gives
Rodenburg’s thumb a savage twist.</p>
<p><strong>rodenburg</strong>: Arrrghh! H-he was – ngh – up at their old
house, last night!</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>rodenburg</strong>: And I’m sorry – I’m fucking sorry! Blaze
releases him. As the goons close in, Blaze deftly relieving Goon #1 of
his handgun and turns it back on him.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Think about it. The goons relent. Blaze and
Nomi exit, leaving Rodenburg slumped on the floor, cradling his mangled
hand.</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: Never thought I’d be back here. They pass
cautiously through the front yard. Nomi’s pickup is parked nearby. The
front door bangs back and forth. Nomi pulls a revolver from her
waist-band.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: I think they’re gone. Off Nomi’s look, Blaze
points at tire tracks in the dirt.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Dual tracks. Looks like your old man switched
to a Hummer.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Guess the boys camped out for a while.</p>
<p><strong>the living room</strong>: Dead leaves twirling. One whole
side of the room is burned open, blackened and charred, the remaining
timbers sealed with plastic sheeting. Nomi opens a drawer, rifles
through singed papers – finds an old PHOTO of her and Carrigan.</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: Listen, those things Vince said –</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: You don’t have to explain yourself to me.</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: Some of them are true.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Doesn’t make you a bad person.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Nomi nods, but she’s clearly agitated.
Blaze crouches, traces his fingers over a stain on the wall. He can FEEL
something. He shuts his eyes, opens them –</p>
<p><strong>blaze’s pov</strong>: The room, many years earlier. Carrigan
backhands Nomi across the face. The silent moment is caught in motion so
slow it’s virtually a tableau.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: He used to hit you. A statement, not a
question. She nods.</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: You can see the past?</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Just echoes, sometimes.</p>
<p>****: Tell me about Starke. Nomi hesitates, not wanting to relive
this.</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: I was dying. I’d shot myself full of Billy’s
best gear. Figured I’d teach him a lesson and go out in style. Blaze
nods, but he doesn’t see Nomi now. He SEES –</p>
<p><strong>blaze’s pov</strong>: – Nomi as she waS. An inch away from
eternity. She is lying on the bed, staring upwards, shallow breaths-
Above her, a MOTH flutters by a light, casting distorted shadows.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: But it felt like a mistake.</p>
<p>****: I don’t want to die.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The lights begin to dim. We hear
FOOTSTEPS approaching, muted and distorted, A SHADOW falls across Nomi
–</p>
<p><strong>starke</strong>: stands above her. There are OTHER SHADOWS
drifting in behind him. Things better left half-glimpsed. Coyotes.
Beasts.</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: He smiled and said – As Starke starts to
speak, we hear:</p>
<p><strong>blaze’s voice</strong>: “You look like –</p>
<p><strong>back to the present</strong>: Blaze finishing the phrase,
knowing the punch-line too well.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: – you could use some help.” Nomi nods, hugs
herself.</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: And I took it. What else was I going to do? I
don’t know what happened after that. I’m not sure I ever want to – All I
know is, nine months later, Rain was born.</p>
<p><strong>flashback images</strong>: Silent, disjointed. The moth.
Nomi’s face, terror-stricken. Starke, eyes alight with malice and
mischief.</p>
<p><strong>back to the present</strong>: Nomi turns away, trying to
banish the memory.</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: Billy-Ray hated her from the moment she was
born. He knew she wasn’t his, knew she was different – If I didn’t leave
he would’ve killed us both.</p>
<p><strong>flashback images</strong>: Nomi striking back at Billy-Ray
with a broken bottle. Setting the house ablaze.</p>
<p><strong>back to the present</strong>: Nomi pulls out a cigarette,
nervously lights it.</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: Been running ever since. In my heart, I guess
I knew Starke would be coming for her one day.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Why send Billy-Ray after you?</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: Sick irony, I guess. Billy certainly knew all
my haunts – This was a mistake, Blaze. We’re not going to find anything
here. Blaze glances down – a HEAT HAZE has engulfed his hand. He
clenches his fist, looks up –</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Guess again. – as HEADLIGHTS shine through
one of the windows. Somebody’s driving up to the house.</p>
<p>****: Shit, they’ve got us trapped here.</p>
<p>****: No. they’re the one who are rang d. Blaze reaches for the door
handle, opens it –</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: What’re you –?</p>
<p><strong>rodenburg</strong>: Talked-to Billy-Ray, chief. Don’t know
who you a r - e, but you picked the wrong – Blaze struggles to contain
the Ghost Rider, but his whole body is drenched in sweat now – like he’s
going to spontaneously combust at any moment.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Please. Just tell us where they went and
leave. There’s no reason why you have to die. Rodenburg LAUGHS, looks at
his friends in disbelief.</p>
<p><strong>rodenburg</strong>: I’m gonna die? Me? Buddy, you got your
head screwed on bass-ackwards! Rodenburg FIRES into Blaze’s chest –
once, twice. Blaze stumbles back against the porch. As he falls,
Rodenburg mounts the steps, charging in after Nomi.</p>
<p><strong>rodenburg</strong>: Had to come back here, didn’t you, Nomi?
Just couldn’t leave well enough alone. Nomi struggles to sit up.
Rodenburg LAUGHS viciously, forces her back, drags at her jeans.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: sits up. He looks to Doyle, TEARS OF FIRE
streaming from his eyes. As he stands, his chest wounds ignites, the
flames instantly cauterizing the flesh. He’s suddenly engulfed in a heat
haze. Wood smolders all around him. Doyle backs away, terrified. He
FIRES his gun again and again, but the bullets just punch through Blaze,
creating more flaming holes-</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: I’m sorry. soul, the fire expanding,
engulfing Doyle.</p>
<p><strong>rodenburg’s pov:</strong>: Flaming leaves burn and twirl at
the far end. Firelight flickers. The SCREAMS still come, sporadic and
terrible. Rodenburg’s mind is racing. He motions to Pennebaker, who
drags Nomi off the bed and strong-arms her to the door.</p>
<p><strong>rodenburg</strong>: Doyle? Smoke and CRACKLING NOISES are
building rapidly. The SHRIEKS persist, and those burning leaves are
everywhere. Then – — movement in the living room! Rodenburg draws a bead
but it’s Weingrod, pushing through the plastic sheeting, fearful, eyes
darting. He speaks in a strained whisper.</p>
<p><strong>weingrod</strong>: What’s going on, man? Where’s Oswalt?
GUNFIRE! Outside! CRASH! Something hits the house. Then more SCREAMS,
more GUNFIRE, and a RUMBLE so deep it’s deadly. Pennebaker panics,
pushing past Rodenburg.</p>
<p><strong>pennebaker</strong>: I want out of here, I’m getting out!</p>
<p><strong>rodenburg</strong>: Keep your fucking voices down!</p>
<p><strong>weingrod</strong>: He’s burning the house, man! He’s</p>
<p><strong>burning the–</strong>: RED-HOT CHAINS whip viciously around
Weingrod’s head and torso. Then he’s wrenched backwards, hauled straight
through the plastic sheeting –</p>
<p><strong>the ghost rider</strong>: bursts through the melting plastic,
hauls his red-hot monster bike up on its back wheel – Rodenburg and
Pennebaker run for their lives, falling into the fire-lit passage. The
Ghost Rider screeches across the living room, setting the place aflame
as he passes through. Nomi leaps aside as a sheet of fire burns where
she was, SEES the fiery monster crash straight through the wall –
Rodenburg and Pennebaker run through the flames, stumbling over Doyle’s
charred body –</p>
<p><strong>ghost blaze</strong>: Half man, half monster, his pitiless
skull-face hazing and flickering between human and inhuman states.</p>
<p><strong>ghost blaze</strong>: Where are they taking the girl?
Rodenburg whimpers. Ghost Blaze grabs Rodenburg’s hair, wrenches his
head back.</p>
<p><strong>ghost blaze</strong>: Where. Are_ They. Taking. Her?</p>
<p>****: North! They’re headed North, into Oregon, oh, god, fuck –</p>
<p><strong>ghost blaze</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>rodenburg</strong>: I don’t know exactly, Jesus, I don’t
know!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Blue-white fire floods down Blaze’s arm
and engulfs Rodenburg. The poor man screams, struggles to break free –
aze simply crrows Otte ana ac and the Ghost Rider’s evil countenance
submerges every trace of Blaze’s humanity. Then it’s over. The flames
evaporate. Rodenburg’s corpse crumbles to dust. Wind HOWLS. The Ghost
Rider is gone.</p>
<p><strong>on blaze</strong>: He SEES the corpses, the burning vehicles,
tries to deny the horror. But it’s always the same – another swath of
destruction left in his wake, another righteous atrocity.</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: He told you everything he knew. She’s ten
yards away, shaking. Not going to come any closer.</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: Told you everything –</p>
<p>****: – you didn’t have to do that.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: You asked for my help. I warned you what you
were getting into. More a statement than an excuse. There are POLICE
SIRENS on the wind. Blaze starts walking towards the pickup.</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: I don’t – I don’t know what else to do for you
–</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: S’okay – just need to rest now –</p>
<p>****: – wounds’11 be healed by morning. Nomi stands, still shaken.
She retrieves a cigarette from her purse, lights it.</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: I thought you were dead.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: I don’t even know if it’s that’s an option
anymore. Every time I get close, I feel myself being dragged back –
–it’s like being born all over again. Like every law in the universe is
being broken. Blaze sits forward, gritting his teeth against the
pain.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: See, the Ghost Rider – it’s drawn to darkness
like a bloodhound. If it thinks you’ve sinned, it’ll find you.</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: What if you’re innocent?</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Nobody’s innocent. Think about it. Everyone’s
done somethincr. You. Me – Blaze lifts up the coyote coin, flipping it
over his fingers.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Every night I spin this fucking coin – and it
always lands the same side up. I keep thinking – ona time, one time I’m
going to spin it and I’ll see the other face. Sleep through the night
without getting blood on my hands. But it never happens.</p>
<p>****: There’s always some sad motherfucker out there that needs
retribution, vengeance –</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Blaze flings the coin away in disgust.
It spins, wobbles, lands coyote side up. He laughs tiredly, then looks
away, lost, suddenly overcome with emotion.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: I’m just so fucking tired – Nomi moves to his
side, struggles to help him up.</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: Here, why don’t you lie down for a little
while? Blaze nods, too tired to argue. Nomi half carries him to the bed,
lowers him down. Blaze settles back, exhausted. Nomi watches him,
holding vigil. His eyes grow heavy. He shuts them a moment, opens them
again –</p>
<p><strong>the past</strong>: – and it’s Roxanne who is laying beside
him now. She rolls over to face him, smiles sleepily. Blaze reaches for
her, touches her face – and the moment shatters into violence.</p>
<p><strong>a collision of images</strong>: – the El Camino sliding,
spinning over. Metal rending. – rain pattering on broken, bloody
wreckage. Roxanne’s torn seat belt hanging loosely. – climbing out
through the blown-out windshield. Crawling in mud, Blaze’s face
reflected in broken glass. – cradling Roxanne’s body in his arms,
rocking her and –</p>
<p><strong>the present</strong>: WHAM! Blaze bolts up in bed,
disoriented, shaken. Clearly, some time has passed. Nomi sits across the
room now, holding Blaze’s tattered photographs in her hands, looking a
little guilty. She’s got the paper wedding band which Blaze made for
Roxanne too.’</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: I’m sorry, I just –</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: As Blaze stands, we SEE that his wounds
have healed.-He shrugs on a shirt, approaches. Nomi nods to the paper
wedding band.</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: You must’ve loved her a lot. Blaze doesn’t
answer. Just takes the photos and wedding band from her, shoves them
back in his pack. He pulls out one of the postcards, scribbles an
address on it.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: A little after three.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: What time, exactly?</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: 3:27. Why? Blaze ignores her, jots down the
time. Licks a stamp and puts it on the postcard. Leaves it on the
dresser.</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: What is it with you and those postcards,
anyway?</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: They’re just a kind of record. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>memory flashes</strong>: Roxanne in the hospital, serene and
beautiful. Starke handing Blaze the coin.</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: You made a deal. Blaze nods.</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: So what happened? Did she live?</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Roxanne? Yeah, she’s alive. She just doesn’t
know it. Coma. Probably never wake up.</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: So he tricked you.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: That’s what he does, doesn’t he? She nods.
That’s what he does.</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: What about the baby? Blaze just shakes his
head.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: It’s funny. That kid was supposed to be my
second chance. Rox and I used to talk about it – how things’d be
different after she was born. Nomi didn’t expect his honest
vulnerability.</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: Maybe that’s why we have them</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: What, kids?</p>
<p>****: So we can make amends for all the royal fuck-ups we’ve
perpetrated on the world. God knows I’ve had my share. I just don’t want
her to have to pay for the things I’ve done. You know? Blaze nods. He
knows all too well. He and Nomi drive on in silence for a beat, their
thoughts turning inwards.</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: Can I ask you something? Honestly? What’re you
going to do when you find Starke?</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Make him pay, somehow –</p>
<p>****: I don’t know. How do you beat the Devil? Walk up and bitch-slap
him? Pretend you’re Schwarzenegger and fire a bazooka up his hind ass?
I’m basically making this up as I go along. Nomi smiles.</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: I’m sure you’ll figure something out.</p>
<p><strong>carrigan</strong>: Yeah? Based on his facial expressions, the
news isn’t good. He sighs, disconnects the call. Landsdale cocks an
eyebrow.</p>
<p><strong>carrigan</strong>: Rodenburg’s dead. Oswalt, Weingrod, all
those other inbred losers too. Looks like my ex-bitch has hooked up with
the fire guy – In the rear-view mirror, Odell’s eyes grow wide.</p>
<p><strong>odell</strong>: No fucking way – Carrigan ponders, nods to
Landsdale.</p>
<p><strong>carrigan</strong>: We’re going to need reinforcements, some
kind of escort to the meet.</p>
<p><strong>landsdale</strong>: I know a guy. Got some boys given over to
wickedness and such.</p>
<p><strong>carrigan</strong>: Make the call.</p>
<p><strong>rain</strong>: He’ll find me, you know. Her voice makes Odell
jump. He thought she was asleep</p>
<p><strong>carrigan</strong>: Hey, kiddo, you’re worrying my boy here.
So shut your goddamn mouth –</p>
<p><strong>rain</strong>: You can’t tell me what to do. You’re not my
father. Wow. The truck collectively holds its breath. Carrigan settles
back, but he’s pissed.</p>
<p><strong>carrigan</strong>: You better believe that, sweetheart. I’m
just the dumb-ass that financed your whole fucking life. You and your
mother both. And what did I get for that selfless act of stupidity? She
burned down the house and gave me something to remember her by. He’s
referring to the scar under his eye. Rain turns away. Huddles against
the door.</p>
<p><strong>landsdale</strong>: Believe me, I could care less what Starke
wants with you. Make you into a fucking hood ornament if he wants to.
It’s not like you came springing out of my loins. Only thing I care
about now is getting what’s mine, and that’s –</p>
<p><strong>landsdale</strong>: – payment and retribution, got it? She’s
not listening. Her bound hands are secretly pushed down into the tight
gap between the seat and the door.</p>
<p><strong>on rain’s fingers</strong>: extending towards A PEN, one inch
out of reach, caught between the seat mechanism and the door sill.</p>
<p><strong>rain’s eyes</strong>: are fluttering. Extreme
concentration.</p>
<p><strong>the pen</strong>: levitates, tilts into her outstretched
hands. The RADIO squeals painfully, pure strident STATIC. Odell punches
a new station, but the STATIC continues, grows – Rain ATTACKS, stabbing
the pen into Odell’s thigh. He SCREAMS, slams the brakes, loses control
of the truck –</p>
<p><strong>on rain,</strong>: weaving between the stalks. She reaches an
old farm implement, uses one of the rusting blades to saw through her
taped bindings. Then she’s up again, running –</p>
<p><strong>on carrigan and landsdale</strong>: searching high and low.
Carrigan SEES movement to his right, surges forward – – but Rain jigs
left and Carrigan misses her, tripping over the farm implement instead.
He cuts himself, curses – Rain continues, straight ahead now. Carrigan
motions to Landsdale. The two split up, drifting in different
directions. They’re gaining on her –</p>
<p><strong>back to rain,</strong>: losing ground. She spies a rock,
scoops it up – and SMASHES across C rr_gan’s Face!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Carrigan falls, dropping the gun. He
searches for it, desperate. Then he SEES it. But as he reaches for it –
– Rain extends her hand, concentrating, eyes fluttering – WHOOSH! The
gun spins away from Carrigan, into Rain’s hands. She doesn’t hesitate
for a second -BLAM!- First shot wings Carrigan, knocks Rain on her ass.
Carrigan DIVES for cover.. She FIRES wildly –CLICK-CLICK-CLICK– but then
the gun is spent and – – Landsdale emerges through the corn, bagging
Rain with his coat. As a shaken Carrigan gets to his feet, Landsdale
slips his belt out of his pants and binds Rain tightly.</p>
<p><strong>odell</strong>: Man, she shot you? Jesus. Lucky she didn’t
perforate my ballsack with that fucking pen.</p>
<p>****: What’s the damage?</p>
<p><strong>odell</strong>: Mounts are cracked, trans-axle’s shot to</p>
<p><strong>hell –</strong>: – this baby ain’t goin’ nowhere.</p>
<p><strong>carrigan</strong>: Fuck. Ma. Carrigan fumes, glances at Rain
– then he just snaps, starts angrily kicking at the door. After a few
futile moments, he stops, paces, looks to Landsdale.</p>
<p><strong>carrigan</strong>: We’re going to need a place where we can
hole up `til tomorrow. Wait for those boys of yours.</p>
<p><strong>landsdale</strong>: How `bout up there? Landsdale points past
Carrigan at a squat group of buildings and machinery – a shut-down ROCK
QUARRY in the distance.</p>
<p><strong>int_ quarry office - dusk</strong>: The Guard slouches in a
corner, bound and gagged. Landsdale and Odell lounge nearby, keeping a
watchful eye on Rain. Carrigan paces by a window, nervously cutting his
deck of cards one-handed. He’s watching the shadows lengthen outside,
the setting sun. He looks to Rain, who matches his gaze – creepy eyes
penetrating his brain.</p>
<p><strong>carrigan</strong>: Where the fuck are those men of yours?</p>
<p><strong>landsdale</strong>: Don’t worry. They’re on their way.
Carrigan nods, cuts his cards. He j worried.</p>
<p><strong>flash of the past</strong>: Chaotic and violent. Rain
attacking Odell. The Hummer crashing. The desperate race through the
cornfield.</p>
<p><strong>back to the present</strong>: as Blaze steps away from the
Hummer, into the field.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: She’s alive.</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: How do you know —? But Blaze isn’t listening.
His gaze is now fixated on the distant lights of the rock quarry.</p>
<p><strong>their pov:</strong>: We can see the main compound of the
quarry from here. Landsdale is in view, having a smoke by the
guardhouse.</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: You think she’s in there? Blaze nods.</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: Then let’s go – Nomi starts forward, but Blaze
pulls her back.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: No. We’ll wait.</p>
<p>****: Dawn’s less than an hour away.</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: You wait. I’m heading in.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Look, they’re not going anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: You don’t know that. This is probably the best
chance we’ll get. They’re sitting ducks. We can do this if you –</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: If I what? Burn them alive? Eat their
spirits?</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: You still get it, do you? The Ghost Rider
whales on whoever’s got it coming, but it’s Johnny Blaze that gets to
remember their faces. And I Lb remember them. Every last one. Just then,
we hear the RUMBLE of approaching MOTORCYCLES. Lots of them. Blaze
turns, SEES a line of BIKERS chugging up the service road on ratted-out
Harleys.</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: They know we’re coming, don’t they? Blaze
nods. Once again, Fate is royally fucking him.</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: I’m going in. You with me or not?</p>
<p><strong>arlo</strong>: Brotherman.</p>
<p><strong>landsdale</strong>: Arlo.</p>
<p>****: I believe you know the Pulsifer Brothers, Chester and Gunt?</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: I’ll find her. You stay here. Nomi moves to
protest, but Blaze silences her.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: If things go South and the Ghost Rider takes
over, I can’t guarantee he won’t –</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: I know. I’m on my own. , Just bring her back
to me. That’s all I care about.</p>
<p>****: Start disabling the bikes. Last thing we need is a gang of
pissed-off speed freaks on our tail. Rip out all the coil wires — Blaze
points to the motorcycle nearest him. Nomi rolls her eyes and pulls out
a switchblade, deftly slicing through a fuel line. Gasoline leaks onto
the ground.</p>
<p>****: – or you could do that. As Blaze creeps away:</p>
<p><strong>blaze –</strong>: Whatever happens –</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: You’re welcome. Blaze leaves. Nomi starts in
on the other bikes.</p>
<p><strong>arlo</strong>: So you need some contract work?</p>
<p><strong>carrigan</strong>: An escort. We’re making a delivery first
thing tomorrow morning.</p>
<p><strong>arlo</strong>: And will there be mayhem involved?</p>
<p><strong>carrigan</strong>: Yeah, I’d say a certain amount of hijinx
are likely to ensue.</p>
<p><strong>arlo</strong>: Well, I’ll tell you, I got nineteen brothers
out there willing to go the distance and enough firepower to give a
small Balkan nation a fucking titty- twister. But we don’t come cheap.
So how many men we going up against?</p>
<p><strong>carrigan</strong>: One.</p>
<p><strong>arlo</strong>: One man?</p>
<p><strong>carrigan</strong>: One man.</p>
<p><strong>arlo</strong>: You trying to diddle my nutpurse, Mister?</p>
<p><strong>carrigan</strong>: Absolutely not. Lemme clarify things –</p>
<p><strong>carrigan</strong>: See, this guy’s not really a “guy”. He’s
more like a demon or something.</p>
<p><strong>arlo</strong>: A demon?</p>
<p><strong>carrigan</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>arlo</strong>: What, exactly, do you mean by demon? Blaze
winces, lifting a hand before his face – BLUE FLAMES dance over his
fingertips. He leans against the wall for support. When he removes his
hand, he leaves a singed palm- print on the drywall.</p>
<p><strong>carrigan</strong>: Like his head’s on fire and shit. Arlo
LAUGHS, the Pulsifers follow suit. Then Arlo turns to Landsdale, icy
now.</p>
<p><strong>arlo</strong>: Brotherman, what in fuck’s name is this smooth
faggot talking about?</p>
<p><strong>blaze’s pov;</strong>: The room, the men – but no Rain.</p>
<p><strong>lands dale</strong>: He’s telling the truth, Arlo. The guy
ain’t human. Saw him torch Albright and Chudacoff with my own eyes.</p>
<p><strong>back in corridor</strong>: Blaze presses against the wall,
desperately trying to rein the Ghost Rider in – but FOOTSTEPS are
coming. A Gargoyle is round; c the corner!</p>
<p><strong>gunt</strong>: Well, I say bring him on. You see this ink?
That’s a hundred hours under the needle. A motherfucking canvas of pain.
He and Chester here, we’re not afraid of fuck-diddly!</p>
<p><strong>on blaze</strong>: hidden in a dark alcove, struggling to
contain himself. If the Gargoyle turns he will surely see him. The
Gargoyle studies the flame, then notices an OPEN WINDOW nearby. He shuts
it, lights his cigarette, turns back – b= Blaze has moved on.</p>
<p><strong>arlo</strong>: If this guy’s as lethal as you say he is, I
want fifty for me, another fifty for the club. Only you can’t let the
boys know we’re takin’ a 50K rake off the top, see?</p>
<p><strong>carrigan</strong>: How `bout sixty and I’ll throw in a kilo
of coke?</p>
<p>****: Coke? That’s like selling snow to Eskimos. You think I’m some
kind of crack-smoking foolio or something?</p>
<p>****: Seventy, then. Arlo reaches into his shoulder-holster, whipping
out a mean looking nickel-plated Colt 44 Anaconda.</p>
<p><strong>arlo</strong>: Ninety, and not a nickel less, you fucking
pillow-biter.</p>
<p><strong>ten or more</strong>: brutish gargoyles drinking beer and
cleaning their weapons. Blaze drops back. His snarling face contorts,
starts to assume that awful skullish quality. The Ghost Rider wants out.
mow. But Blaze fights, shoves it back down and deep. SOMETHING moves to
Blaze’s right – a TINY WHITE FIGURE, lolling and flopping at the far end
of the passage.</p>
<p><strong>carrigan</strong>: E a sy, gentlemen. No need to get all
truculent on me.</p>
<p><strong>arlo</strong>: Truculent? You get that out of a Scrabble
dictionary or something? What the fuck does “truculent” mean? I’ll tell
you what it means. It means</p>
<p><strong>that moment, elsewhere - rain’s face</strong>: Extreme mental
concentration. Temples pounding. Her eyes are fluttering, rolled to
white.</p>
<p><strong>back to blaze</strong>: as he starts towards the toy
skeleton. He’s in agony now, each breath a cough of fire, each footstep
igniting the floorboards. He SEES a storage room up ahead –</p>
<p><strong>carrigan</strong>: Okay, alright – how about seventy-five and
we’ll smoke the old peace pipe?</p>
<p><strong>arlo</strong>: How `bout eighty or you’re gonna be smoking my
dick?</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>arlo</strong>: What is that?</p>
<p>****: Sounds like a smoke alarm.</p>
<p><strong>glint</strong>: Smells like somethin’s burning.</p>
<p><strong>carrigan</strong>: What-is this, fucking charades?! It’s
h,jM, you- ass-holes !</p>
<p><strong>the ghost rider</strong>: emerges seconds later, Rain cradled
in the crook of his arm, safe in a cool bubble of air. She looks to
Carrigan. The meaning in her gaze is implicit: “I told you so”.</p>
<p><strong>gargoyles</strong>: appear from every direction. Guns BLAZE.
Bullets turn-to slag, vaporizing as they enter the Ghost Rider’s aura of
hellfire. Rain drops from the Ghost Rider’s arm, runs. The Ghost Rider
advances. The Gargoyle nearest him empties a machine pistol into the
Ghost Rider. The Ghost Rider reaches for the weapon. At his touch, the
pistol becomes RED HOT – The Gargoyle CRIES OUT. The Ghost Rider takes
the pistol, and FIRES BACK. The Gargoyles stumble, clawing at their
smoking wounds. In seconds, the entire weapon turns WHITE HOT, melting
apart in the demon’s hand, SIZZLING away into nothing – The Ghost Rider
keeps coming. Men are SMASHED aside, incinerated. Bravado turns to
terror, to chaotic scramble –</p>
<p><strong>rain! “</strong>: Rain makes for the pickup, scrambles inside
even as –</p>
<p><strong>the ghost rider</strong>: strides from the burning ruins of
the compound. With a wave of his hand, the wall of flame parts like the
Red Sea. He locks his gaze with Nomi, points a skeletal finger at her.
His meaning is clear: “You are on the list.” Nomi floors the gas. The
pickup slews and grinds, finds purchase, leaps away from the monster as
–</p>
<p><strong>the pulsifer brothers</strong>: emerge from the building,
burned but howling for blood, fueled by a lethal combination of
stupidity and crystal mech. Carrigan, Landsdale, and Arlo fall in
behind. The Ghost Rider moves, whipping his red hot chains. Left, he
lassos a passing gargoyle, BURNS him. Right, another Gargoyle, dragged
from his bike and reduced to ash. Then two more lashes to either side of
the brothers. Two more victims reeled in – charred corpses falling at
the Ghost Rider’s feet. The whole thing took three seconds.</p>
<p><strong>chester</strong>: Forget it, bro, live to fight another day.
The Ghost Rider slams his skeletal hand on the tank of a nearby bike.
The bike glows RED HOT and CHANGES SHAPE, getting bigger, nastier,
demonically slouched –</p>
<p><strong>gunt</strong>: No fucking way! That’s my hog! As the Ghost
Rider mounts the newly transformed hellcycle, Gunt charges forward,
infuriated. He OPENS FIRE with his mini-•un, .er. rounds a second.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Moving with uncanny speed, the Ghost
Rider grips Gunt by the throat and hauls him off his feet, unleashing
the full fury of his Penance Stare.</p>
<p><strong>a blast-wave of light</strong>: erupts from the Ghost Rider’s
eye sockets, engulfing Gunt. Gunt SHRIEKS, his cries becoming
infant-like ULULATIONS. Arlo, Carrigan, Chester, and the others
instinctively shield their faces, falling back from the infernal glow
–</p>
<p><strong>chester</strong>: Gunt!</p>
<p><strong>on gunt,</strong>: images from his own subjective hell
assault him. Tears stream down his cheeks as his body ignites. His
corneas are burning, melting. The Ghost Rider starts to accelerate now,
from zero to sixty in an eye-blink, hauling Gunt’s writhing body along
with him - straight into the burning building.</p>
<p><strong>a fire extinguisher,</strong>: blasting the Ghost Rider’s
head. The Ghost Rider SQUEALS and for a split-second, the demon’s flames
are actually snuffed out. The cloud clears. The Ghost Rider glimpses</p>
<p><strong>odell</strong>: rushing into another room, SLAMMING a steel
door behind.</p>
<p><strong>rain</strong>: What about the Ghost Rider? We have to go back
for him!</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: Are you crazy?! Sit down! Then Nomi glances in
the rearview mirror. Oh. My. God.</p>
<p><strong>the ghost rider</strong>: is coming after them. HOWLING,
plowing through the inferno on his hellcycle. Nomi floors the gas. But
the pickup is already maxed out. The Ghost Rider easily gains on the
truck, leaving a wake of burning asphalt. He lashes out with his chains,
snags the back bumper. The chain-links slice deep into the steel
bodywork. The Ghost Rider hauls up onto his back wheel – Nomi slams on
the brakes. The truck fishtails. The Ghost Rider rear-ends the pickup.
Bike and demon cartwheel crazily into the cargo bed, SLAMMING
explosively against the back window of the cab. Hot glass showers Nomi
and Rain – The Ghost Rider is pinned, SQUEALING, entangled with his
bike. Nomi floors it again. The truck leaps ahead – – but the Ghost
Rider hangs on as his bike slides backwards. He reaches into the cab,
clutching at Nomi. The pickup thunders up a rise –</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The Ghost Rider’s skeletal fingers clamp
Nomi’s shoulder. She HOWLS in pain, her clothing beginning to smoke.
Rain tries to help, imploring –</p>
<p><strong>rain</strong>: No, no, no –</p>
<p><strong>the ghost rider</strong>: recoils, blinded by the dawn. He
releases Nomi, collapses backwards. His fire extinguishes, his
skull-face fades – – and Blaze lies in the pickup bed, shaking. Nomi
glances back through the shattered cab window, her face a mask of fear
and sympathy. Blaze looks to Gunt’s bike, which has also reverted to its
original state, then SEES –</p>
<p><strong>blaze’s pov:</strong>: The bad guys coming on battered bikes
– Arlo, Chester, plus FOUR OTHER GARGOYLES. And bringing up the rear, a
seven ton Mack dumper driven by Carrigan. Landsdale rides shotgun. Blaze
looks to Nomi, SHOUTS over the wind:</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Give me your gun! Nomi passes it back. The
Gargoyles OPEN FIRE. Bullets zing and whine. Blaze shoves Gunt’s cycle
off the pickup bed The heavy wreck CRASHES and bounces, wasting the
first Gargoyle. The others swerve around the sliding debris</p>
<p><strong>an oncoming tanker truck</strong>: brakes, jack-knifes. Four
gargoyles make it past, the fifth is flattened. The Mack comes last,
SMASHING a passing minivan into a spin –</p>
<p><strong>angle on a gas station</strong>: A STATE TROOPER, hidden from
view, hits his SIREN, gives</p>
<p><strong>back to arlo and the other gargoyles</strong>: Gaining,
riddling the pickup with BULLETS. Blaze is pinned in the bed, can’t get
off a shot –</p>
<p><strong>on chester pulsifer,</strong>: hanging back and riding
one-handed. He hefts a 66mm LAWs rocket on his shoulder, LAUNCHES it –
Near miss. But the impact lifts the pickup’s rear axle into the air.
Nomi SCREAMS. Blaze hangs on for dear life.</p>
<p><strong>on carrigan,</strong>: hauling the Mack alongside Chester
–</p>
<p><strong>carrigan</strong>: The hell you doing? I need the kid
alive!!!</p>
<p><strong>chester</strong>: Fuck the kid and FUCK YOU!!! Chester aims
the launcher again. Carrigan swerves, CRUSHES Chester under the Mack’s
mighty wheels.</p>
<p><strong>the trooper car</strong>: pulls alongside the Mack, SIREN
wailing. Carrigan veers hard, forcing it into the opposing lane. Up
ahead: ROADWORKS. The highway narrows to a single lane –</p>
<p><strong>back to arlo and the gargoyles</strong>: Gaining on the
pickup, trading shots with Blaze at ninety miles and hour. Blaze wings
one Gargoyle, then plugs another who loses control, cartwheels
catastrophically, EXPLODES – Arlo zigzags the debris, guns his hog,
screams closer. Blaze fires but – CLICK, CLICK, CLICK – he’s out!</p>
<p><strong>roadworks</strong>: The pickup mows down barricades like
dominoes, clips a hot tar cooker, spins spumes of molten tar in all
directions. HIGHWAY WORKERS run for their lives. Nomi SMASHES through
barricades, leaps a pile of rough gravel. Blaze is nearly hurled out the
bed, but hangs on, shoulder screaming –</p>
<p><strong>a foreground worker</strong>: operating a jackhammer fails to
notice the careening pickup racing by, which-is, in turn, followed by
Arlo and –</p>
<p><strong>the mack truck and the state trooper,</strong>: ana necx at
OOFJ2 Ann r i t s over, end.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: Arlo rides against Nomi’s door, lets
rip with his Uzi. Glass SHATTERS. Rain and Nomi duck – Arlo tries again,
sticks his Uzi right into the cab. But Nomi forces the gun upwards.
Bullets puncture the roof, shell casings ricochet- In desperation, Nomi
reaches for the door latch, kicks her foot against the door. The door
swings outward, taking Arlo along with it.</p>
<p><strong>up ahead</strong>: is a concrete divider. Nomi abruptly veers
right, clipping Arlo against the divider, killing him instantly.</p>
<p><strong>on blaze</strong>: hauling himself back into the pickup bed
even as –</p>
<p><strong>the mack</strong>: bears down on them. Landsdale jumps from
the cab, landing alongside Blaze. The two men struggle in the cargo bed,
hand to hand, exchanging a volley of vicious blows. Nomi is desperate,
doesn’t know what to do. Landsdalp is getting the upper hand. He grips
Blaze by the throat, forcing him over the side of the pickup bed,
shoving Blaze’s head towards the churning wheels of the Mack –</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: Do something!!!</p>
<p><strong>on rain,</strong>: concentrating, focusing all her energy on
Landsdale. She CRIES OUT, makes a forceful hand gesture – – and
Landsdale’s glasses SHATTER. He SCREAMS, blood pouring from his eyes.
Blaze rolls, throws Landsdale over his shoulder – into the wheels of the
Mack.</p>
<p><strong>up ahead, a massive roadblock</strong>: Barricades,
bulldozers, dozens of state police cars. The pickup and the Mack pass
over a line of TIRE SPIKES. The tires BLOW. The trucks drop. Metal rims
SPARK and GRIND –</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: Hold on to something! She brakes. The pickup
fishtails. Carrigan also brakes, struggling to keep the Mack under
control. Then the Mack catches a rim, flips, rolls –</p>
<p><strong>slow motion</strong>: The rolling Mack plows into the
roadblock, seven tons of iron crushing cruisers and barricades alike.
The pickup careens off the road, plunges into a cornfield, hits a rut,
grinds to a halt –</p>
<p><strong>a series of dissolves</strong>: The aftermath. Trooper cars
sliding to a halt. Carrigan being dragged from the Mack at gun point,
handcuffed. Armed TROOPERS plunging into the cornfield, YELLING. Nomi
falling out of the cab, finding Rain, unhurt, alive. She drags Rain into
the sea of corn. Rain looks back, SEES –</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: being surrounded by Troopers, wrestled to the
ground.</p>
<p><strong>on blaze</strong>: chained, cuffed, struggling with TWO
DEPUTIES trying to drag him to a cell. Further up, Carrigan is being
similarly escorted. Blaze looks to the faces of his fellow prisoners,
dread seizing his body.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: I have to talk to the warden. You have to put
me someplace else –</p>
<p><strong>deputy #1</strong>: Should’ve thought of that before you
pulled that “Dukes of Hazzard” stunt.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Please, just listen to me. Put me in
solitary, anywhere but here.</p>
<p><strong>deputy #2</strong>: This isn’t a fucking hotel, chief.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: You don’t understand, people will die –
WHACK! A baton blow to the knee. Blaze CRIES OUT, staggers –</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: Easy on the threats, big guy –</p>
<p><strong>number ten!</strong>: The cell door opens. Blaze struggles
even more violently now.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Do not put me in here! Do not leave me with
these men! They’ll die if you do this!! ! The deputies force Blaze
inside, using batons, boots. A stun gun SPARKS. Blaze falls. The cell
door SLAMS. The inmates opposite are LAUGHING, waving, bashing their
bars with every metal implement they’ve got as we –</p>
<p><strong>rain</strong>: Are we safe now? Nomi regards her sadly. She’s
never been one to tell lies.</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: Honey, I don’t know if we’ll ever be safe.
Rain nods, knew the answer instinctively. Something about her look – far
too fatalistic for a child her age.</p>
<p><strong>rain</strong>: He talks to me sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>rain</strong>: My father – – when I’m dreaming.</p>
<p>****: What does he say? Rain starts to cry now, suddenly overwhelmed.
Despite her eerily calm demeanor, she’s still a child. And a frightened
one at that.</p>
<p><strong>rain</strong>: I don’t want to be like him, mom.</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: You won’t.</p>
<p>****: You don’t know that.</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: Yes, I do, baby – Nomi hugs her, desperate, as
if the world were ending. Outside, across the land, the sun shines
gloriously bright.</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: – yes I do.</p>
<p><strong>a moth</strong>: fluttering by an outdoor light, casting
distorted shadows on the stucco wall. Nomi stares, uneasy, something
tugging at- her memory as we SEE –</p>
<p><strong>a brief flash of the past</strong>: Nomi back on the bed,
ODing. The SHADOW of Starke falling over her. The moth fluttering
above.</p>
<p><strong>back to the present</strong>: as Nomi turns to the parking
lot, SEES a coyote slouching out of the gathering darkness. And she
knows. 5-ba fucking knows.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: My father used to say that the only way evil
came into your life –</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: was if you invited it.</p>
<p><strong>rain</strong>: Mom –?!</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: Sweety, you have to get out of here now.</p>
<p><strong>following nomi</strong>: as she drags Rain into the bathroom.
She tears the shower curtain back. There’s a window just above the
shower stall barely big enough for someone like Rain to squeeze
through.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: I’m not sure about that. At least not
anymore. What I CQ know is this:</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: We hear FOOTSTEPS in the walkway
outside. SOMEONE is coming-___” Nomi tugs open the window, lifts Rain
towards it –</p>
<p><strong>nomi</strong>: Honey, go, GO! ?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: We are born alone and we die alone.</p>
<p><strong>on carrigan,</strong>: terrified, backing into the far corner
of his cell.</p>
<p><strong>the other prisoners</strong>: pause, watching the beginning
of Blaze’s transformation, their CRIES taking on an entirely new kind of
urgency.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: It’s what happens in-between that
matters.</p>
<p><strong>int_ motel room - bathroom - night</strong>: Rain squirms
through the window, drops to the ground outside.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: – the choices we make, the people whose paths
we cross – She stands, casts a fearful look to at Nomi, then runs off
into the stormy night.</p>
<p><strong>on nomi</strong>: backing out of the bathroom as the front
door EXPLODES OPEN. She turns around –</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: – these are the things that determine our
fate.</p>
<p><strong>starke</strong>: stands in the doorway, coyotes slouching in
around his heels. The beasts attack, growing and changing, their
gnashing mouths of razored teeth opening wide to consume Nomi as –</p>
<p><strong>the town</strong>: spread out below, FIREBALLS engulfing a
distant building –</p>
<p><strong>the corridor beyond</strong>: The prisoners are frantic,
leaping about like frightened lab animals. THOOM! THOOM! The Ghost
Rider’s heavy FOOTFALLS ring out as it strides down the corridor,
turning his awful gaze on the first cell. The Ghost Rider extends a
hand, sending a STREAM OF HELLFIRE coursing over the prisoner within.
The Ghost Rider moves on, to the second and third cells, swiveling his
gaze back and forth, BURNING the occupants within. Like shooting fish in
a barrel. THOOM! THOOM! The Ghost Rider continues its rampage.
Murderers, rapists, malefactors. Some curse, others plead, others simply
drop to their knees and pray. For they know, instinctively, that the
universe is not an arbitrary place, that their Day of Judgement has
come. The entire jail is ablaze now, a roiling extension of the Ghost
Rider’s fury, drowning out the VOICES OF THE DAMNED.</p>
<p><strong>on the final cell</strong>: where Carrigan cowers within. The
deck of cards in his hands drops, scatters. Some of them catch fire,
shrivel up –</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The Ghost Rider waves his hand. The bars
separating them melt, flowing to the floor like liquid. He stares down
at Carrigan, his hollow eve sockets sparking to life.</p>
<p><strong>as the penance stare</strong>: erupts from the Ghost Rider’s
eyes, Carrigan reaches for something beneath the bed – cell wall. He
holds it up. The effect is catastrophic, like the Medusa having her own
deadly gaze turned back upon her. The Ghost Rider stumbles backwards,
SHRIEKING, assaulted by an onslaught of subjective images. Visions
horrifying enough to drive even a demon mad.</p>
<p><strong>boots</strong>: are coming. We’ve seen them before. These
boots belong to –</p>
<p><strong>starke</strong>: navigating his way through the bedlam. He
passes between rushing emergency personnel, steps over a writhing VICTIM
– – but no one seems to notice his presence. And as he progresses to the
far end of the cell block, the cacophony fades, leaving only his
FOOTSTEPS as he turns into –</p>
<p><strong>carrigan’s cell</strong>: Carrigan is terribly burned, but
still clinging to life. Frantic paramedics are running an IV, struggling
to stabilize him. His fear-filled eyes grow dim, then abruptly snap into
focus as he SEES –</p>
<p><strong>starke</strong>: You look like you could use some help.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: – Starke standing over him, his gaze
stoic and pitiless.</p>
<p><strong>starke</strong>: You lost her, Carrigan. What happened?</p>
<p><strong>carri gan</strong>: – you didn’t tell us – what he was
Carrigan starts to slip away. The SOUNDS of the outside world begin to
intrude once more. Starke kneels, touching a hand to Carrigan’s chest.
The world ebbs away again. The paramedics continue their work,
oblivious. Carrigan MOANS.</p>
<p><strong>carrigan</strong>: – please, I don’t want to die – Starke’s
arctic eyes gleam bright with mischief.</p>
<p><strong>starke</strong>: If I could save you, would you be willing to
make a deal?</p>
<p><strong>silent memories</strong>: assault him – good times with
Roxanne, happy times, making the onrush that much more unbearable. We
INTERCUT –</p>
<p><strong>roxanne,</strong>: radiant at the beach. Flickering sunshine
makes her squint.</p>
<p><strong>back to blaze,</strong>: here and now, cocking the gun,
turning it back on himself.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: folding clothes, seen through a sunny
doorway.</p>
<p><strong>back to blaze,</strong>: fingering the trigger of the gun,
edging closer to the unknown, the terrors that the afterlife holds for
him.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Her laughing face, loving Blaze from across
a dinner table.</p>
<p><strong>back to blaze</strong>: suppressing a sob. The pain is too
much. It’s overwhelming –</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: and Blaze at the obstetrician’s. On the
sonogram monitor, w e SEE unborn child shifting positions within
Roxanne’s womb, PUSH IN on the eerily beautiful image and –</p>
<p><strong>back to blaze</strong>: Fuck it. He presses the barrel
against his forehead. Squeezes his eyes tightly shut, compresses the
trigger – – but he can’t do it. He lowers the gun, weeping with
frustration and – freezes, head cocked like he heard a voice. He scans
the cemetery: graves, trees, nothing. Then he spins around —</p>
<p><strong>rain</strong>: stands behind him, waif-like. Big, melancholy
eyes. They stare at each other for a long time, not knowing what to
say.</p>
<p><strong>rain</strong>: My mother is dead. The statement hangs.
Another death. Another failure of Blaze’s part.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: How–?</p>
<p><strong>rain</strong>: My father found us, just like she knew he
would. Rain looks down at Blaze’s hand – the gun resting there. Blaze
meets her gaze and tucks the gun away, embarrassed. The wind picks up.
Rain looks to the graves.</p>
<p><strong>rain</strong>: What do you think happens when you die? Do you
think there’s a heaven?</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p>****: But what do you think? Blaze studies Rain. This kid is hurting.
What she needs now, is reassurance. And try as he might, Blaze just can’
t seem to harden his heart against her.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Yeah, I think there’s something. Maybe not
angels playing harps and stuff, but</p>
<p>****: – something. Rain wipes her nose with her sleeve, wanting to
believe it.</p>
<p><strong>rain</strong>: He’ll keep coming, you know. Unless you stop
him.</p>
<p>****: I don’t know that I can anymore.</p>
<p><strong>rain</strong>: But you’ll try, right? Blaze regards her
curiously. Even in grief, she’s a consummate negotiator.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: I don’t have anything left to give, kid.
Blaze stands, starts walking. Rain follows.</p>
<p><strong>rain</strong>: My mother said you were a good man.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>rain</strong>: She said I could trust you.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: You can’t.</p>
<p>****: But don’t you think there’s a reason why all of this is
happening? Like fate?</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: I don’t believe in fate.</p>
<p><strong>rain</strong>: Maybe it believes in you. Blaze stops. Cold.
Deja-vu all over again. He looks back at Rain. Sighs.</p>
<p>****: Alla! Mision de Sante Lupia! High up the mountain: an old adobe
building perched on stilts, precariously overhung. On top of its bell
tower, a crucifix stands clear and proud.</p>
<p><strong>rain</strong>: We’re going to a church?</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: It’s not a church. It’s a mission. They take
people in. Blaze pays the driver. The truck roars away. Rain looks back
to the mission, doubtful.</p>
<p><strong>rain</strong>: Are you going to dump me there?</p>
<p><strong>tolbein</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Our car broke down a few miles back and my
daughter and I were wondering if we could crash here for the night.
Tolbein sizes them up – doesn’t like what he sees.</p>
<p><strong>tolbein</strong>: Don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: What about a ride, then? Is there a town
somewhere you could take us to? Other men have gathered behind Tolbein –
VISCOTT, WILSON. One of them, NUNEZ, nods to the South.</p>
<p><strong>nunez</strong>: Why don’t you head back to Dawson? They got
motels there.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: That’s not really an option.</p>
<p><strong>tolbein</strong>: Then I’d say you’re out of luck.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Look, you must have a cot, something. The
kid’s hungry –</p>
<p><strong>rhymer</strong>: I’m sure we can figure something out. JOE
RHYMER, 50s, approaches, silences Tolbein with a look. He’s down to
earth, capable, wearing a black shirt, cleric’s collar, oily jeans, and
muddy work boots.</p>
<p><strong>rhymer</strong>: Joe Rhymer. I’m the Padre.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: This is Rain.</p>
<p><strong>rhymer</strong>: Rain? That’s a pretty name.</p>
<p>****: You hungry, Rain? Would you like something to eat? Rain nods.
Rhymer ushers them inside. As he moves to follow, Tolbein stops him.</p>
<p><strong>tolbein</strong>: Bottom line, Father. There’s something
wrong with those two. Especially the kid.</p>
<p><strong>rhymer</strong>: Duly noted, Richard.</p>
<p>****: And overruled.</p>
<p><strong>angle on a raggedy figure</strong>: jutting into frame in the
foreground. Blaze pauses at the threshold of the chapel, looks back,
uneasy – but it’s just a SCARECROW being buffeted about by the wind.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Those men outside –</p>
<p><strong>rhymer</strong>: Most of them are on a work-release program.
We’re a halfway house for ex- offenders. We try to get people on their
feet, reintegrate them into society. Blaze glances at Rain,
apprehensive.</p>
<p><strong>rhymer</strong>: Don’t worry, you’re perfectly safe here. But
of course, that’s not what Blaze is thinking.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Blaze watches from a distance, cleaned
up, clothes laundered– Rhymer approaches, gestures to the garden.</p>
<p><strong>rhymer</strong>: It’s turned out beautiful, hasn’t it? We try
to be as self sufficient as we can, back to the earth and all that. He
notices that Blaze is staring at the lowering sun.</p>
<p><strong>rhymer</strong>: You any good with diesel engines?</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: I know my way around a flywheel housing.</p>
<p><strong>rhymer</strong>: Well I’ve got a generator out back that’s
been on life support the last few weeks. Mind helping me try to
resuscitate it? Blaze looks at him curiously.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>rhymer</strong>: So how long have you been running?</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>rhymer</strong>: You know what I mean. You spend as much time
around lost souls as I have, you learn how to read a man’s face.</p>
<p>****: You want to hand me that crescent wrench? Blaze hands Rhymer
the wrench, who then makes an adjustment.</p>
<p><strong>rhymer</strong>: Take the girl, for instance. She’s not your
daughter, is she?</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>rhymer</strong>: So what happened to her mother?</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: She’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>rhymer</strong>: Did you kill her?</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: No. Rhymer studies Blaze, decides he believes
him.</p>
<p>****: She doesn’t have anyone else. I’m just trying to protect
her.</p>
<p><strong>rhymer</strong>: And who’s protecting you?</p>
<p><strong>moments later,</strong>: Blaze and Rhymer are cleaning
up.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Listen, I appreciate what you’re trying to
do, but I’ve never really been a come to Jesus kind of guy.</p>
<p><strong>rhymer</strong>: I wasn’t talking about Jesus, I was talking
about a little healthy introspection. Working here, staying in one place
for a while, seeing what surfaces. I’ve found that people tend to arrive
on our doorstep for a reason. Blaze considers this formidable man, a
yearning moment then he shakes his head.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: I can’t stay. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>rhymer</strong>: What about the girl, then? Whatever you’re
involved in, I can’t imagine it’s good for her well-being. We can find a
home for her.</p>
<p>****: I’d have to leave tonight – Rhymer nods, understanding, he
motions towards a beautiful motorcycle parked back in the shadows – a
`71 Norton Commando 850. Black, with gold pin-striping.</p>
<p><strong>rhymer</strong>: You can take the Norton.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: I don’t have any money.</p>
<p><strong>rhymer</strong>: So send us some when you do. Blaze is moved
by this man’s simple humanity – but he’s also wrestling with the idea of
abandoning Rain.</p>
<p><strong>flames.</strong>: Blaze looks up once more. His eyes are
shadowed sockets. This is the real PENANCE STARE, and Blaze is feeling
its awful, mournful ache.</p>
<p><strong>nomi’s voice</strong>: He wants to know if you’re a bad man.
He wants to know – if the Ghost Rider turned its penance stare on you,
would you burn? Blaze clenches his fist around the coin, spins on his
heels.</p>
<p><strong>angle on a dorm room window</strong>: Rain stands at the
glass, watching Blaze leave.</p>
<p><strong>rhymer</strong>: That which was from the beginning, which we
have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon,
and our hands have handled, of the Word of life.”</p>
<p><strong>sees something</strong>: through a window which startles her
– only to realize that it’s just the scarecrow out in the field,
flapping wildly.</p>
<p><strong>the men</strong>: “For the life was manifested, and we have
seen it, and bear witness, and shew unto you that eternal life, which
was with the Father, and was manifested unto us.”</p>
<p><strong>rhymer</strong>: “That which we have seen and heard declare
we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our
fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ. And these
things write we unto you, that your joy may be full. This then is the
message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is
light –”</p>
<p><strong>rhymer</strong>: – and in him is no darkness at all.”</p>
<p><strong>up ahead,</strong>: the land falls sharply away, spilling
down into a wide expanse of moonlit ocean pregnant with the promise of
release.</p>
<p><strong>nunez</strong>: Padre. You’d better take a look at this.
Rhymer joins him. SEES what he SEES: COYOTES gathering. Six or more.
They creep malevolently towards the mission.</p>
<p><strong>nunez</strong>: You ever see anything like that before?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Rhymer shakes his head, looks to –</p>
<p><strong>rain</strong>: She’s acutely conscious of the men staring at
her now, still clutching the coin like a rabbit’s foot.</p>
<p><strong>tolbein</strong>: It’s her – she’s the one doing this.</p>
<p><strong>rhymer</strong>: That’s enough, Richard.</p>
<p><strong>tolbein</strong>: I’m telling you, Father, there’s something
wrong with – CRASH! One of the windows SLAMS open, startling everyone.
Rhymer moves to it, latches it shut again.</p>
<p><strong>tolbein</strong>: What is this?! SCARE! A snarling coyote
comes out of left field, just misses his throat – Tolbein leaps
backward, SLAMS the door. The men start SHOUTING. Rain backs away. She
knows what’s happening. WHAM! An animal rams the door. Then another. And
another –</p>
<p><strong>rhymer</strong>: Get away from the windows!</p>
<p>****: Wilson, take Rain to the chapel.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Wilson hesitates, eyeing Rain with
distrust-</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: I ain’t going nowhere with her. All the men
are giving Rain a wide berth now. WHAM! Another snarling coyote hits the
glass.</p>
<p><strong>rhymer</strong>: One of you, please, just take the kid to the
chapel.</p>
<p><strong>tolbein</strong>: Father, that’s the last place she should
be. CRUNCH! Something strikes the room a massive blow. Something MUCH
BIGGER than a coyote. Viscott starts praying.</p>
<p><strong>nunez</strong>: Quiet, Viscott! THUMP! CRUMP! More heavy
blows. Like the Fist of God. Making the floorboards beneath their feet
vibrate. SOMETHING shambles past the window. What in God’s name was
that?</p>
<p><strong>tolbein</strong>: I knEw we should’ve sent them away! THOOM!
Another impact. THOOM!THOOM! Plaster cracks. Dust falls. Viscott wails,
praying even more stridently. Nunez is losing it_</p>
<p><strong>tolbein</strong>: She’s the one they want, I’m telling you! –
and the lights abruptly go ou The storm bellows and blusters. The men
huddle together, fear thick and sour.</p>
<p><strong>carrigan</strong>: Raainn – Raaaaiinnn – A gastly VOICE,
monstrously corrupt, but still recognizable as Billy-Ray Carrigan.</p>
<p><strong>carrigan</strong>: – where are you, Rainnnnnnn? Rain shrinks
away from the insidious mewling.</p>
<p><strong>tolbein</strong>: I told you – Even Rhymer is shaken now. He
moves to investigate, presses up against a cracked window –</p>
<p><strong>rhymer’s pov</strong>: Carrigan stands outside, lurching
between patterns of moonlight and shadow. But the movement is all wrong.
And in our momentary glimpses of him, we get the sense that he’s been
horribly changed – as if his body had been torn apart, then haphazardly
reassembled into something else. CRUNCH! The wall fractures. Rhymer
staggers back. WHUMP! CRUNCH! A row of impacts moves along the wall –
Tolbein and Nunez scramble to reach the dining room door. They close it,
turning the locks. WHANG! Carrigan slams against the other side of the
heavy, steel door. WHANG!WHANG! Again and again and again. The men are
terrified, SHOUTING at each other. The door is buckling inward, the
hinges bending and GROANING – Then the pummelling stops. Just the sound
of BREATHING, halting and phlegmatic. No one moves, not a whisper.
CORROSION starts to spread across the metal door.</p>
<p><strong>nunez</strong>: What the fuck –?! Rhymer edges close to the
decaying door, peering through a gap in the frame – Carrigan peers back,
moonlight illuminating his face. There are buttons where his eyes should
12P. He BELLOWS:</p>
<p><strong>priest! give me the girl!</strong>: The POUNDING begins anew,
harder now. The weakened door is surely about to give way. Rain is
terrified.</p>
<p><strong>tolbein</strong>: Do what he says! Put her out!</p>
<p><strong>rhymer</strong>: Get back with the others!</p>
<p><strong>tolbein</strong>: We don’t do what it says, that thing
outside there’s gonna kill us all. Rhymer steps in front of Rain, levels
his shotgun at Tolbein’s chest.</p>
<p><strong>rhymer</strong>: God as my witness, Richard, lay a hand on
that girl and I will pull this trigger. Tolbein hesitates – then grabs
at the shotgun. He twists it from Rhymer’s hands, SMASHES the butt
across Rhymer’s jaw. Rhymer sinks to the floor. Tolbein grabs Rain,
drags her SCREAMING to the door. He waves the shotgun at the others
–</p>
<p><strong>tolbein</strong>: Open the fucking door! DO IT! Nunez fumbles
with the lock. Rhymer recovers, throws himself at Nunez, tries stop him
from opening it. The pounding ceases. All eyes sweep to the door –</p>
<p><strong>two buttons</strong>: roll through the gap between the bottom
of the door and the floor, coming to rest at Rhymer’s feet – immediately
oottina the floorboards beneath them.</p>
<p><strong>carrigan</strong>: I can see you, Priest. I can see every
last one of you.</p>
<p><strong>the door bursts open,</strong>: knocking Tolbein, Rain,
Rhymer and Nunez on their asses. All eyes bug as Carrigan shoulders his
way inside. Only he’s n..t Carrigan anymore. Now he’s –</p>
<p><strong>the scarecrow</strong>: A golem of dessicated flesh knitted
together with straw and sodden burlap, pieces of insects, twine, and
razor wire. Button-socket eyes. Jagged bone teeth. Beetle-black chitin
for fingers and nails. His very existence is an affront to nature.
Everything the Scarecrow touches instantly corrodes and decays.
Floorboards rot, metal rusts. Every movement, every spastic shudder and
twitch is a source of incalculable pain.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The Scarecrow thrusts his hand out and a
STORM OF DEMONIC CROWS explodes from his chest, whirling about like a
cyclone of knives. Now the coyotes enter too. Dozens of them, SNARLING,
DIVING at the men, sinking their jaws into flesh. The men are trapped.
Some try to flee. Others fight back, swinging chairs and planks –</p>
<p><strong>the scarecrow</strong>: stalks into their midst, snaring
victims left and right, HURLING bodies or pulling them apart – He
snatches Viscott up by his throat. Bugs swarm over the SCREAMING
parolee’s face as it rots and decays. In seconds, Viscott’s entire body
decomposes, putrefies, falls apart –</p>
<p><strong>rhymer and rain</strong>: back up towards the kitchen.
SCREECH! A crow-thing comes flapping. Rhymer FIRES. The creature SHRIEKS
and flops – Nunez claws another from his face, SEES it’s not a crow at
all, but some kind of wriggling eyeless monstrosity with a deformed
razor beak, matted feathers, bony talons – Wilson, trapped under a
bench, BEATS desperately at a gnashing coyote. Lands a real blow. The
beast falls back then stands up like a man?</p>
<p><strong>various angles</strong>: as the OTHER COYOTES do likewise.
The coyotes are changing shape, enlarging, canine skeletons CRACKING and
re-arranging themselves into –</p>
<p><strong>jaw-beasts</strong>: The same half-glimpsed horrors we
glimpsed accompanying Starke. All muscle and gnashing fangs and bloody,
ripping claws.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Not a cricket, not a lizard. Just the
moonlit expanse of ocean below. Then we hear THUNDER, like distant
artillery. Blaze looks back over his shoulder –</p>
<p><strong>blaze’s pov</strong>: Distant thunderheads. LIGHTNING
flickering. CLOSE ON Blaze, trying to drive Rain from his mind. We can
SEE on his face that it’s a losing battle – for poor, cursed Johnny
Blaze has finally understood his purpose on this earth.</p>
<p><strong>the scarecrow</strong>: pitches through the opening, lurching
forward. Jaw-beasts fall in behind him. Razor birds whirl around his
head. The survivors scramble for the far exit. Rain opens every gas
burner on the grill as she passes by – but the far exit is locked. And
Rhymer doesn’t have the key! BOOM! Rhymer shotguns the lock! The lock
fractures, but the exit still won’t open. Tolbein starts kicking. Rhymer
aims</p>
<p><strong>rain</strong>: Shoot the gas!</p>
<p><strong>rhymer</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>the scarecrow</strong>: advances. Bugs swarm from beneath his
tattered feet. Every metal implement and surface rusts as he passes.</p>
<p><strong>shoot the gas!</strong>: Rhymer hears the ranges HISSING and
FIRES. CHOOM! The gas fireballs, catches Scarecrow full-on sideways. He
squeals, reels. Burning jaw-beasts writhe and howl. Rain falls to the
floor, dropping the coyote coin. It spins furiously as we –</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: so fast that molten asphalt spumes from
behind like lava. – so fast that the goddamn camera can barely catch it
and – B-BOOM!!! The hellcycle breaks MACH 1, SONIC BOOMS rocking the
landscape as we –</p>
<p><strong>various angles - dining room, kitchen, staircase</strong>:
The jaw-beasts_ The razor birds. All pause. All listen. They know
something’s coming. Something fast. Something bad. We hear it now too –
the WHINE of an APPROACHING ENGINE.</p>
<p><strong>on the coyote coin</strong>: wobbling to a stop, coyote side
up. Realizing what’s about to happen, the Scarecrow lets loose a GHASTLY
WAIL and –</p>
<p><strong>the ghost rider</strong>: erupts through the wall in DEEP
SLOW MOTION, sending forth a majestic tsunami of fire and debris. The
monster bike skids, carves floorboards like matchwood –</p>
<p><strong>jaw-beasts and razor birds</strong>: hurl themselves out of
its scorching path – The Ghost Rider vaults from the saddle, sends the
bike spinning at the scurrying monsters. It ninepins a few, takes out
the rest as it impacts the wall like a nuke –</p>
<p><strong>the crow-things</strong>: are vanquished, squealing and
flopping like living cinders.</p>
<p><strong>but the jaw-beasts recover,</strong>: still aflame but very
much alive. If anything, they seem emboldened by the fire. They circle
the Ghost Rider, more and more of them joining the pack.</p>
<p><strong>the ghost rider</strong>: readies his chains. The jaw-beasts
attack. Three dozen horrors pouncing and GNASHING. The Ghost Rider takes
them.- Chains, flames, sheer power and force – Spines snap. Lupine
skulls burn. The Ghost Rider tears the monsters limb from limb. The room
becomes the Seventh Circle of Hell, and at the heart of the Inferno, the
Ghost Rider exults in the slaughter – The whole mission is ablaze now,
fire and churning smoke consuming everything in its path. Rhymer, Rain,
and Tolbein run for their lives.</p>
<p><strong>their pov:</strong>: a hundred foot drop straight down to the
highway.</p>
<p><strong>tolbein</strong>: There’s no way down from here! CRACK! The
door behind them splinters. The Scarecrow’s found them once again.</p>
<p><strong>a staircase</strong>: And still, they attack. And now the
Ghost Rider is weakening. He stumbles on the steps, falls to his knees.
The fiends pile atop his back –</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Summoning all his power, the Ghost Rider
emits a SHOCKWAVE OF FLAME, a HEAT-BOMB that blasts the creatures clean
off him.</p>
<p><strong>rain</strong>: huddled beneath a flimsy bed-frame.</p>
<p><strong>raaaainnn! raainn!</strong>: The Scarecrow hurls aside a bed
and finds Tolbein. He reaches for the man, sinking his spindly finger’s
into Tolbein’s chest. Tolbein SCREAMS, instantly shrivelling, corroding
into dust – The Scarecrow hurls aside yet another bed and finds –</p>
<p><strong>rhymer</strong>: aiming his shotgun, point-blank range! BLAM!
The BLAST Takes a chunk out of the Scarecrow’s face.</p>
<p><strong>back to the scarecrow,</strong>: recovering, his makeshift
flesh knitting itself back together. Flames kiss his body, causing
sodden particles on his frame to SIZZLE and POP – but because his
decayed flesh is so wet, he never ignites.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Enkindled BUZZING bug-ember things swirl
around the Scarecrow’s head in a halo, impossibly alive- He stumbles
after Rhymer and Rain into</p>
<p><strong>the bathroom</strong>: A claustrophobic box of stalls and
urinals. Rhymer and Rain are nowhere to be seen. Enraged, the Scarecrow
tears into the stalls, ripping them aside one by one –</p>
<p><strong>red-hot chains</strong>: whip viciously around the
Scarecrow’s sodden head and torso. He’s wrenched backwards, hauled out
of the bathroom and SLAMMED across the dormitory into the opposite wall
–</p>
<p><strong>the ghost rider</strong>: At the other end of the chains.
More accurately,</p>
<p><strong>ghost blaze,</strong>: battered and weakened, staggering. His
flames are barely flickering, his bony flesh has become chalky and
brittle. He’s holding a jaw-beast skeleton, drops it to the floor – The
Scarecrow attacks. Hand-to-hand combat. Massive blows and blocks. The
burning room SHUDDERS with each impact –</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Ghost Blaze uses his chains, but he’s
weak, and Scarecrow turns them back on him, SMASHES him against the
walls. More structural fractures, more dust –</p>
<p><strong>on rain and rhymer</strong>: Desperate for escape, the flames
closing in on them. There’s nowhere to go. Except a small HATCH, high up
in the ceiling –</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: Ghost Blaze HOWLS, in agony as the
Scarecrow’s superior evil dominates. He feebly extends a hand towards
the flames nearby, trying to compel the fire to him. The flames twist,
briefly bend in his direction. The Ghost Rider HOWLS with frustration.
He needs the flames. He will die without them. He tries again, reaching,
reaching –</p>
<p><strong>the flames</strong>: surrounding the two foes are starting to
bend in earnest now, streaming towards Ghost Blaze’s bony, begging
fingertips The Scarecrow is oblivious. Just keeps pouring more misery
into Ghost Blaze’s body as –</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: – clouds of embers are pulled into
coursing streams-.– – roiling fireballs are dragged wildly from walls,
floors and ceilings – – flame and fury funneling thunderously into
SCORCHING FIRE- SPOUTS that cyclone up and up and up into –</p>
<p><strong>a flame tsunami</strong>: steamrollers through every room and
passage, destroying everything in its path, consuming itself.</p>
<p><strong>on rain</strong>: emerging from the smouldering bathroom,
ghostly white. She picks her way cautiously across the teetering floor.
Kneels alongside Ghost Blaze –</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Blaze’s eyes are black pits, gaunt and
skullish_ Rain casts — - about, finds a BURNING EMBER, cups it in her
hands, holds the flame close to his mouth – Ghost Blaze senses the fire,
breathes it in like a drowning man. Draws the flame deep into his lungs,
keeps drawing until the ember is gone, internalized. Their eyes
meet.</p>
<p><strong>rain</strong>: Are you going to die?</p>
<p>****: Not today. He pushes up on his elbows, tiredly rises to his
feet and –</p>
<p><strong>the mission</strong>: Topples. Ghost Blaze and Rain run – but
they’re not going to make it. The whole room is dropging away at their
heels! Ghost Blaze snatches up Rain, DIVES through a widening split in
the wall even as –</p>
<p><strong>on ghost blaze and rain,</strong>: clutching precariously to
a muddy hillside. Ghost Blaze looks up, SEES –</p>
<p><strong>dawn approaching,</strong>: first light bleeding in over the
distant mountains.</p>
<p><strong>carrigan,</strong>: back to human, hopelessly trapped deep in
the wreckage. He’s barely alive, just a face in the rubble. Carrigan
blinks.</p>
<p><strong>carrigan</strong>: who – the fuck – are you, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>ghost blaze</strong>: Vengeance. And Ghost Blaze raises his
hand, HELLFIRE trickling down the length of his arm, swirling around his
hand like a building static charge even as –</p>
<p><strong>carrigan</strong>: Do it, fucker – dQ it.</p>
<p><strong>rain</strong>: appears on a ridge just before them, eyes
locking onto him. It’s now or never. Ghost Blaze hesitates, hesitates –
then abruptly reins the flame back in. Metabolizes the fury. Pushes it
down deep through sheer, agony-inducing willpower. Ghost Blaze SCREAMS,
struggles – – and forces the Demon away, Now he’s just Blaze, weak with
exertion, but triumphant for the first time in years. He turns away and
we –</p>
<p><strong>ext_ mission grounds - dawn</strong>: – Blaze and Rain
walking, working their way across the scorched grounds. Rain kicks at a
carbonized jaw-beast skull. It rolls, SMASHES against a tree, crumbles
to dust. Blaze looks up just then, HEARS the sound of —</p>
<p><strong>starke’s cadillac</strong>: It slows to a stop at the end of
the drive, ENGINE RUMBLING. Dusty and bug-begrimed from its
cross-country journey. Blaze braces himself. A silent inhalation of
breath. Rain stares, paralyzed by fear – The driver’s door opens. A
hulking silhouette steps out. The Beast, backlit by the fiery dawn which
is just breaking over the horizon. Sunlight FLARES outward, briefly
blinding us. And when it subsides –</p>
<p><strong>starke</strong>: is standing there. Human. Windblown. He
raises a hand, shielding his gaze from the light. Steps cowards them
–</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Blaze moves in front of Rain, blocking
Starke’s path. They stand there in silence. And Starke smiles, eyes
alight with mischief.</p>
<p><strong>starke</strong>: Looks like we’ve come to the end of the
road, haven’t we?</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Guess so. After a long beat:</p>
<p><strong>starke</strong>: Give me the girl and I’ll lift the curse.
Blaze looks down at Rain. This was all he ever wanted. The only thing
that has kept him going all these years. He reaches into his jacket,
retrieving a crumpled pack of cigarettes. Plucks one out –</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: She’s all yours, Starke – – and lights it
without a match, somehow conjuring the flame from within himself. He
takes a long drag. In the pits of his eyes, something glows there – a
kind of lambent darkness.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: – but you’ll have to go through me if you
want her. Starke stares into Blaze’s eyes. Doesn’t like what he
SEES.</p>
<p><strong>starke</strong>: Don’t be a fool, Blaze. I’m offering you
your life back.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: That’s not a life. And least now one I’m
interested in living.</p>
<p><strong>starke</strong>: You think you can control it. You can’t.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Guess I’m willing to take my chances. Starke
nods, accepting defeat. For now. He looks down at Rain, a bitter smile
creeping across his face –</p>
<p><strong>starke</strong>: You have your mother’s eyes. – and walks
away. Blaze and Rain watch him retreat. Presently, a coyote slips from
shadows, joining him on the road. It–lopes along beside him. We watch
them disappear over a rise. Then they’re gone. Beat. Rain studies Blaze,
reaches for his hand.</p>
<p><strong>rain</strong>: He’ll be back.</p>
<p><strong>blaze</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>back amongst the smoking ruins</strong>: We pass broken
concrete, smouldering timber, a rock snake constricting a mouse, an
industry of beetles dissecting a bird’s carcass. Finally, we come to a
small, deep cavity – and there, tucked away in the darkness, we find
–</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: And that’s how it ended. With another
beginning. A kind of balance struck between the flame and the fury.</p>
<p><strong>blaze’s coin</strong>: balanced perfectly on it’s edge. How
it fell like that, at the heart of the wreckage, is a mystery that will
probably never be solved.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: And me? I still sleep. Wandering. Waiting.
Listening to the whispers of the dead.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: The world turns around without me. There
are sharks. And there are doves. And nighttime holds far darker terrors
than death. But I am never afraid because I know that he is out there,
somewhere. And that someday, somehow – Blaze ignites, SCREAMS, hurls
back his head –</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: – he will return to me. – and the Ghost
Rider rockets headlong into black.</p>
