<h1 id="village">village</h1>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Who will plague me with questions now?… Who
will pinch me to wake me up? Who will laugh at me when I fall? Who’s
breath will I listen to so that I may sleep? Who’s hand will I hold, so
that I may walk?</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: We came here to start anew –</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: We came here to start anew. We are grateful
for the time we have been given.</p>
<p><strong>and then we hear it, the sound carries through the air
and</strong>: BLEEDS INTO THE VILLAGE. IT COMES FROM THE WOODS.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Drill bell.</p>
<p><strong>orange light from the torch lit next to him, flickers on
his</strong>: FACE.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: What manner of spectacle has caught your
attention so splendidly? I ought to carry it in my pocket to help me
teach.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Who came upon this?</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Philip, did you move this?</p>
<p><strong>it is hard for us to see through all the tiny legs and
feet</strong>: OF THE CHILDREN. THERE IS SOMETHING DARK AND MOIST LYING
IN THE DIRT.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Okay, lets have it. What delicious
conclusions have you come to?</p>
<p><strong>thin boy</strong>: An animal God created was slain.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Donald, please try to speak plainly. It
disturbs your mother when you speak so darkly. Everything need not be
said with such drama.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Marybeth.</p>
<p><strong>marybeth</strong>: I inspected it carefully. Its head was
twisted back and much of its fur removed.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: It was murdered.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: So who is the culprit? Who has done this
heinous act?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Those We Don’t Speak Of, killed it.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: And there it is. Why would such a notion
enter your heads?</p>
<p><strong>twelve-year old boy</strong>: Those We Don’t Speak Of have
claws.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Children… Those We Don’t Speak Of have not
breached our border for many years. We do not go into their woods and
they do not come into our valley. We do not threaten them. Why would
they do this?</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: It is a warning of doom to come.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Donald.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Is it possible, in your haste, you have
missed the simplest explanation? That this small animal was slain by a
slightly larger animal like a fox, and that this said fox carried it
into our village to avoid other scavengers from coming and eating his
prize. And when our village awoke and started its morning business, the
fox was scared off and left its prize for us to find. I can’t say if
that’s what really happened, but it’s certainly more reasonable to think
that, than something… unprecedented.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I did see two foxes on the hill yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Does anyone have further questions
pertaining to our immediate doom?</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Then if it is agreeable, let us begin our
studies.</p>
<p><strong>fidgety woman</strong>: We ought not to overlook the Flight
of the Birds. We didn’t have it last year and I for one missed it
desperately. I know Tabitha missed the children dressed in feathers and
such.</p>
<p><strong>tabitha</strong>: I am fond of it.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I do not have a say in this matter. August
Nicholson is Chair of today’s meeting.</p>
<p><strong>august</strong>: The Flight of the Birds will be returned to
this year’s Fall Festival.</p>
<p><strong>fidgety woman</strong>: Let us speak of food then.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: There is a young man who has requested a word
with the elders.</p>
<p><strong>august</strong>: Do have him come forward.</p>
<p><strong>green eyes</strong>: My mother is unaware of the reason for
my visit today. She did not give her consent or consult me in any
form.</p>
<p><strong>green eyes</strong>: I have spent all but my first years in
this village. It is all that I know. It is a blessed place, this
village. Our days are filled with love and compassion and joy.</p>
<p><strong>green eyes</strong>: But there is also some suffering and
fear. The passing of little Daniel Nicholson from illness –</p>
<p><strong>green eyes</strong>: – and other events have weighted on my
thoughts. We have been taught of the greed and corruption that exists in
the towns. And the countless wasted lives centered on the exchange of
money there. But we have also been taught about their fascination with
science and machines and medicine. Could they have rescued Daniel from
his terrible illness? I ask permission to cross into the forbidden woods
and travel to the nearest town. I will gather new medicines and
information of what has happened in the world, and I will return.</p>
<p><strong>green eyes</strong>: With regards to Those we don’t speak of,
I am but a single person, I am not a threat to them, I am certain they
will let me pass. Creatures can sense emotion and fear. They will see I
am pure of intention and not afraid. The end.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Lucius Hunt, that is the most I’ve heard you
speak in many years combined.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: What goes on in that head of yours?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Say something Lucius.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: Finton Coin is in the Tower. I promised to
sit with him.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Why do you not tell me what you feel? I do
not know if you think about love. I do not know what your dreams are.
When you stood today, you spoke in such a gentlemanly manner. I scarcely
recognized you.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: How can a mother fail to recognize her son?
Tell me. Tell me that…</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: I do think about love.</p>
<p><strong>finton</strong>: Did anyone see your approach?</p>
<p><strong>finton</strong>: I saw Christop Crane sniffing around. He
suspects something. He has announced, more than once, in my presence
that only one man should hold post in the tower each night. Why would he
say such a thing if he didn’t suspect? What a wretch he is? Is it so bad
to be a trifle timid? Are you sure you were not detected?</p>
<p><strong>finton</strong>: And I shared a portion of my chicken with
him not two days ago. A fine, tender piece.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: Do you ever think of towns Finton?</p>
<p><strong>finton</strong>: The towns? What for? They’re wicked places
where wicked people live, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>finton</strong>: I do hope no one saw you.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: We understand the depth of your worries, but
you needn’t be alarmed.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: What we seem to have amongst us, is a
scavenger of some type. Most likely a coyote or wolf. It’s manner of
killing and removing the fur, but leaving the flesh torn may be a sign
that the animal may suffer from madness.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: For the next fortnight we should be vigilant
for sightings of this coyote. Keep careful watch over the little ones as
they play on the hills. As for the other notion… we do not believe our
boundary has been breached. Those We Don’t Speak Of are much larger
creatures than coyotes. We would know if they had been here.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: It’s frightful, this business with the coyote,
is it not Papa?</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Do not feel worried Kitty?</p>
<p><strong>kitty</strong>: You are not troubled?</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: I am certain it will all end soon.</p>
<p><strong>kitty</strong>: Can we speak on other matters then?</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: It would be a relief.</p>
<p><strong>kitty</strong>: I am in love.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: I have great reverence for the word ‘love’
Kitty. It should not be thrown about lightly. It is the greatest force
on this earth.</p>
<p><strong>kitty</strong>: These feelings are so strong, it can be
nothing else Papa.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>kitty</strong>: You do not believe me.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: I have no judgment yet.</p>
<p><strong>kitty</strong>: It must have been bubbling inside me for a
long time, for it came bursting forth not three days ago. I have thought
of nothing since.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: ‘Bursting forth’ is it?</p>
<p><strong>kitty</strong>: I realized since I’m the eldest of your
children and since you were stricken with five girls and no boys, I
decided to act as if I were the son and ask your permission.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: I must correct you on the word ‘stricken’. I
would not trade any one of my five daughters for a hundred of the finest
boys. So now, what is it you are asking permission for?</p>
<p><strong>kitty</strong>: I would like permission to marry, Papa.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: There is a proper manner in which these
things are to happen. Such as the boy would normally be standing next to
you at a moment such as this. Where is the boy in all of this Kitty?</p>
<p><strong>kitty</strong>: I haven’t spoken to him as of yet.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: The young man is unaware of your
intentions?</p>
<p><strong>kitty</strong>: He has a quiet way. I was going to talk with
him, but I wanted your blessings papa. I won’t talk with him without
your blessings.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Kitty –</p>
<p><strong>kitty</strong>: It’s Lucius Hunt.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: – Lucius?</p>
<p><strong>kitty</strong>: You think badly of him?</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: No, no… I’ve just been thinking on him
recently.</p>
<p><strong>kitty</strong>: He’s not like the other boys. He doesn’t joke
and bounce about.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: He certainly doesn’t.</p>
<p><strong>kitty</strong>: Do I have your blessings then?</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Do me one favor first Kitty. Do not tell
anyone else of your ‘burstings’ until you have spoken with the young
man.</p>
<p><strong>kitty</strong>: Papa, something does trouble you?</p>
<p><strong>kitty</strong>: Good afternoon Lucius.</p>
<p><strong>kitty</strong>: I wanted to tell you something.</p>
<p><strong>kitty</strong>: My goodness, my heart is pounding so fast, I
think I may faint on this spot… You’d probably catch me course, before I
fell.</p>
<p><strong>kitty</strong>: Seeing as you’re of age… and seeing as I’m of
age… and seeing as we get along so well like this… A thought entered my
head that may have entered your head as well.</p>
<p><strong>kitty</strong>: I love you Lucius. I love you like the day is
long. I love you more than the sun and moon together. And if you feel
the same way, we should not hide it any longer. It’s a gift, love is. We
should be thankful. We should bellow it with all the breath in our
lungs, “Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!’</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Why are you sorrowful, why do you weep? Why do
you ask me to rock you to sleep? Could you but see thro’ this world’s
vale of tears…</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Light would your sorrows be, harmless your
fears, all that seems darkness to you would be light, all would be
sunshine where now is but night…</p>
<p><strong>august</strong>: You are very kind.</p>
<p><strong>august</strong>: You must pardon my manners. I haven’t slept
in many nights.</p>
<p><strong>august</strong>: – like a dog can smell you.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: Did you say something Mr. Nicholson?</p>
<p><strong>august</strong>: – you may run from sorrow. As we have.
Sorrow will find you.</p>
<p><strong>august</strong>: It can smell you.</p>
<p><strong>august</strong>: There were pastries with cream in them.</p>
<p><strong>august</strong>: – my wife and I, we used to throw dinner
parties.</p>
<p><strong>august</strong>: – in town. We served pastries with cream in
them.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: He has tears in his eyes, Christop.</p>
<p><strong>christop</strong>: He’s doing capitol. Just a few more
moments…</p>
<p><strong>christop</strong>: Do not jostle about so. You’ll ruin my
shirt.</p>
<p><strong>we are in the darkness of the woods, we are behind the
boy,</strong>: WE SEE THE SILHOUETTE OF HIS SLIGHT FIGURE STANDING ON
THE TREE STUMP.</p>
<p><strong>boy on stump</strong>: They made a sound when I made a sound.
They mimic before they attack.</p>
<p><strong>christop</strong>: That’s a wives tale. It isn’t true. Do not
falter… A few moments more.</p>
<p><strong>there are noises in the woods. the sound of leaves
being</strong>: CRUNCHED.</p>
<p><strong>kitty</strong>: Noah ought to be punished. He wacked little
Joseph with a stick again.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Noah Percy, stop your fussing right this
moment.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: You’re in trouble you know?</p>
<p><strong>noah</strong>: No hitting.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: I’m to place you in the quiet room.</p>
<p><strong>noah</strong>: – I’ll cry quarts.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: What if we strike a deal?</p>
<p><strong>noah</strong>: Capitol! Capitol idea!</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: It would be prudent to keep our deal a secret.
Can you do that?</p>
<p><strong>noah</strong>: Like a church mouse.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: You needn’t go to the quiet room if you take an
oath to never strike any person again.</p>
<p><strong>noah</strong>: No hitting.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: No hitting.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: The deal is struck.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: We ought not return right away. What shall we
do with our stolen time? Shall we have a foot race? Up the hill to the
resting rock.</p>
<p><strong>noah</strong>: No cheating.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: What a deeply scandalous thing to say. I insist
you take that back… Is that the school bell?</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: My sister cried a lot.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Do you wonder how I recognized you.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Some people, just a handful mind you, give off
the tiniest color. It’s faint, like a haze. It’s the only thing I ever
see in the darkness. Papa has it too.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Do you wonder what your color is? Well that, I
won’t tell you. It’s not ladylike to speak of such things. You shouldn’t
even have asked.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: I know why you denied my sister.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: When I was younger you used to hold my arm when
I walked. Then suddenly you stopped. One day, I even tripped in your
presence and nearly fell. I was faking of course, but still you did not
hold me. Sometimes we don’t do things we want to do, so that others
won’t know we want to do them.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: A flower, what a splendid present.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: Be cautious. You are holding the bad
color.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Noah it is not allowed. This color attracts
Those We Don’t Speak Of. You must bury it.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: You ought not to pick that color flower
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: He did not pick that now.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: What’s wrong? You’re breathing has changed.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: I’ve never set eyes on such a flower.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: Noah… where did you find this?</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>noah</strong>: No cheating.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: My mother is unaware of the reason for my
visit today. She did not give her consent –</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Lucius.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: You do not need to address us so formally.
You may just speak.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: We mustn’t –</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: We mustn’t –</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Lucius, you may read from the paper if you
wish.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: – or consult me in any form. Today at
Resting Rock. Noah Percy handed Ivy Walker a flower of the bad
color.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: When asked where he found this flower, for
it was not like others I have seen, he took us there. He led us to the
peak of the hill, by the tree stump. There he pointed to a bush covered
in flowers of the bad color.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: He was pointing into Covington Woods.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: By my eye, the bush of the bad color was, at
the very least, seventy-five paces past the forbidden line.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: It is my belief that Noah Percy has entered
the woods, and has done so on many occasions. It is also my belief, that
because of his innocence, those creatures who reside in the woods did
not harm him. This strengthens my belief that they will let me pass if
they sense I am not a threat. I ask for further consideration in my
request to travel into the woods so that I may gather medicines and
informations from the nearby town.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Noah Percy!</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: We shall speak of the town, just this once,
and we shall never speak of it again.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: When we lived there, the three of us, you
were but an infant. I would be telling an untruth if I said there was no
joy. We were contented souls: the three of us… But contentment is an
unwelcomed alien in the towns. There is something in the very nature of
the cities and towns that rejects it. Society survives on greed, and
desire. Its heart is fed by wants. It has no place for something so
untradable and old fashioned as contentment. Your father left for the
market on a Tuesday at quarter past nine in the morning… He was found
robbed and naked in the river two days later.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: Why do you tell me this blackness?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: So you will know the nature of what you
desire.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: I do not desire it!</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: My intentions are true to my word. I think
of nothing but the people of this village.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: I know that. Forgive me. I am but scared for
my only son’s life.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: I am not the one with secrets.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: What is your meaning? Speak! Do not retreat
to your silence yet.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: There are secrets in every corner of this
village. Do you not feel it? Do you not see it?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: That is for our own well being. So the things
that scare us do not have power over us.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: Then let us open it.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: No –</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Perhaps we should speak with Edward Walker
together. He may –</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: He hides too.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: He hides his feelings for you.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: Sometimes we don’t do things – yet others
know we want to do things – so we don’t do them.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: What nonsense are you saying?</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: You needn’t worry. Nothing will happen to
me.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: You remind me of a colt sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: What makes you think he has feelings for
me?</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: He never touches you.</p>
<p><strong>there is sudden movement. leaves and branches snap as
we</strong>: SEE, FIFTY FEET AWAY, THE DARK FORM OF A HUMPED CREATURE,
STANDING UPRIGHT. IT SUDDENLY MOVES. WE SEE IT STRIDE AWAY INTO THE
DENSENESS OF THE WOODS.</p>
<p><strong>girl’s voice from bush</strong>: There is no escape.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Oh, Hello.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: I was just playing a game with Noah. The rascal
must have gone to hide in my house again. Houses are against the rules.
He knows that.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Are you okay? Your quiet is a different quiet
than your usual quiet.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: I assume you’re nodding.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Well I better get back home and confront the
scoundrel. You could walk with me if you like.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: We were tending to the children tonight, Kitty
and I… I should be with her. Be well.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: I heard my parents speaking of you. I know of
your request to go to the towns. I think it is noble, but I do not think
it is right.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: There may be things we do not know that may
help us.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: You speak as if we are plagued. There is
nothing to cure.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: Are you not angry you have no sight? Perhaps
your eyes could have been saved as a child by knowledge held in the
town’s medicines.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: I know it upset Papa very much when it happened
to me. He would not speak for three days I was told. But it does not
bother me Lucius.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: What of Noah then? What if there was
medicines for Noah that could help him be still? Help him learn?</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: May we stop speaking of this? It is putting
knots in my stomach.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Kitty is to be married.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: She has found love again. With Christop
Crane.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: You think it an odd choice right? You know he
won’t sit back in his chair for fear of setting wrinkles his shirt. But
he does have a gentlemanly way about him and he does care for my sister
deeply. I think Kitty is blessed. I am blessed as well… My older sister
is now spoken for. I am now free to receive interest from anyone… who
might have interest.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Goodnight Lucius Hunt.</p>
<p><strong>finton</strong>: Lucius?</p>
<p><strong>finton</strong>: Lucius?</p>
<p><strong>something passes underneath. it is dark in form and
moves</strong>: DEVILISHLY QUICK INTO THE SHADOWS.</p>
<p><strong>and then the warning bell sounds in the distance. it is
very</strong>: DIFFERENT THAN THE PRACTICE BELL IN THE YARD. ITS SOUND
IS DEEPER MORE POWERFUL AND RESONANT. ITS SHORT REPEATED RINGING ECHOES
THROUGH THE AIR.</p>
<p><strong>kitty</strong>: Close all the doors.</p>
<p><strong>he watches as a creature moves slowly towards the front
door</strong>: OF THE CABIN.</p>
<p><strong>kitty</strong>: You must close the door!</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Lucius is out walking.</p>
<p><strong>kitty</strong>: He’s inside safe somewhere. Close the
door!</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: He’ll come back to make sure we’re safe.</p>
<p><strong>strange sounds can be heard through the walls in the back
of</strong>: THE CABIN.</p>
<p><strong>kitty</strong>: Ivy please!</p>
<p><strong>a humped creature emerges from the darkness. it starts
rushing</strong>: TOWARDS THE PORCH.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>kitty</strong>: Don’t let them in!</p>
<p><strong>the large darkened figure of the creature climbs onto
the</strong>: PORCH.</p>
<p><strong>sounds of scratching and clawing can be heard on the
walls</strong>: OF THE CABIN. THE DISTANT SOUND OF THE WARNING BELL IS
MUFFLED IN THIS UNDERGROUND SPACE.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: We may question ourselves at times such as
these. Did we make the right decision to settle here? We must remember
why we came here. It was for goodness and a rare type of innocence. That
is worth a struggle I think. Let it be known for all to comfort in, that
no person was injured lat night. We have always had, from the day we
settled here, a gentle understanding with those who visited us. I have
always pictured them, in some ways, as our protectors. They have allowed
us to live here nestled amongst them in this untouched place. By the
markings we find this morning on our homes, I feel they were warning us.
They acted as if threatened. We will do our best to discover what it is
that has set them to action.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: I myself wonder if this simple way of life
can go on… If it was meant too…</p>
<p><strong>august</strong>: If any want to talk of their worries or
concerns, we would welcome them.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Who has written this note?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: It is the wish of the writer for this to be
read aloud.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Please read so that all may hear. My mother
is unaware that I wrote this note. She did not give her consent or
consult me in any form. I have brought this burden upon us. On the day
before last, I crossed the forbidden line into Covington Woods and was
witnessed there by Those We Don’t Speak Of.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: I am deeply sorry. I have shamed myself and
my family. I pray that my actions will cause no further pains. With
deepest sorrow, Lucius Hunt.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Do not fret.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: You are fearless in a way, I shall never
know.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. percy</strong>: Ta. Tee-tee. Ta.</p>
<p><strong>class</strong>: Ta. Tee-tee. Ta</p>
<p><strong>mrs. percy</strong>: Splendid. Shall we take it from the
first phrase of the song?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. percy</strong>: It has been difficult to concentrate, I
admit. The visit from Those We Don’t Speak Of three weeks past, are
still with us… I know some of you are frightened still. This is why our
job is so vital. We must lift everyone’s spirits. Kitty Walker’s wedding
will be a glorious time. We will sing and dance and be merry again. Now
let us be strong little souls and begin the song again from the very
beginning.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: I know you have been ignoring me.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: It is the day of my sister’s wedding and I am
beginning to believe you would let the day pass without saying a word to
me.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Perhaps you sensed I was angry when you
revealed you crossed into the woods. In fact I was. If you want to act
foolish, that is your choice. But I do not find any reason to risk such
dangers in the woods for anything. It was wrong. I say this as your
friend, because friends may say anything to each other.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: I’m glad we’ve had a chance to talk. Kitty
needs help getting ready. Enjoy your biscuit.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: We came here to start anew – We are grateful
for the time we have been given.</p>
<p><strong>august</strong>: These are the experiences we came here to
have. This is good. This is pure.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. clack</strong>: I had an elder sister.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Mrs. Clack, you have been keeping secrets.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. clack</strong>: Kitty reminds me of her so.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: What manner of person was she?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. clack</strong>: Saucy. We fought endlessly.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: May I ask her name?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. clack</strong>: Your father created a miracle here in
this place. Sheltered us from darkness.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Why did she not come to Covington Woods?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. clack</strong>: My sister did not live past her twenty-
third birthday. A group of men took her life in an alley by our
home.</p>
<p><strong>august</strong>: Please rise.</p>
<p><strong>christop</strong>: She’s not going to squeeze my shirt like
that is she?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Many blessings on this most joyous of
days.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: It was a rare and lovely ceremony, was it
not?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Glorious. I saw your hand move to your eyes
on more than one occasion.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Must have been dust of some matter.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: Who’s come to visit me?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: They are in the village.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: It cannot be.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: It saw us. It ran off into the darkness.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: You are certain?</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: You two boys stay close to Ivy here. She’ll
tell you some funny stories and have you laughing soon.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: We will go together. All of us.</p>
<p><strong>the courtyard before them is littered with dead
animals.</strong>: CHICKENS, AND SQUIRRELS AND RACCOONS. THEY HAVE ALL
BEEN SLAUGHTERED AND SKINNED, THERE ARE A HANDFUL OF SKINNED ANIMALS
DANGLING FROM ROPES TIED TO THE POSTS OF THE HOUSES.</p>
<p><strong>gerald</strong>: They would like you at the shed, sir.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: All the livestock has been taken, and
skinned. The fur and feathers are missing. There are marks on the door,
where it was opened.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: The marks are high. Coyotes cannot reach that
height.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Are you scared Alice?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: I am, sir.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: So am I.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: The elders are going to have an inquiry
tomorrow. Each member of the village is to be questioned in the meeting
hall.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: To see how the border was breached?</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: It is cold outside. You ought to go in.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Why are you on this porch?</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: It is not safe.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: There are other porches.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Do you find me too much of a tomboy?</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: I do long to do boy things. Like that game the
boys play at the stump. They put their backs to the woods and see how
long they can wait before getting scared. It’s so exciting. I understand
you hold the record. It will never be broken they say.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: It’s just children’s games.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: How is it you are brave when all the rest of us
shake in our boots?</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: I do not worry about what will happen. Only
what needs to be done.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: How did you know I was here.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: I saw you out the window. No, I won’t tell you
your color. Stop asking.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: When we are married, will you dance with
me?</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: I find dancing very agreeable.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Why can you not a say what is in your head?</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: Why can you not stop saying what is in
yours?</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: Why must you lead, when I want to lead? If I
want to dance, I will ask you to dance. If I want to speak, I will open
my mouth and speak. Everyone is forever plaguing me to speak further.
Why? What good is it to tell you, you are in my every thought from the
time I wake? What good can come from my saying I sometimes cannot think
clearly or do my work properly? What gain can rise from my telling you
the only time I feel fear as others do is when I think of you in harm?
That is why I am on this porch Ivy Walker. I fear for your safety before
all others. And yes I will dance with you on our wedding night.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Kitty, I wanted to speak with you first. I
would not want you to feel pain in any fashion. You are my cherished
one. If you were to feel badly about Lucius, I would not have it. One
love to sacrifice another love is not right.</p>
<p><strong>kitty</strong>: Do not fret, younger sister.</p>
<p><strong>kitty</strong>: There is nothing you can do that would
sacrifice my love for you. You are my cherished one as well. God bless
you and your life together.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: …I had been to the storage shed twice to
fetch food prior to the wedding ceremony.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: And the livestock was untouched at that
time?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Yes, Mrs. Hunt. All was as it should be.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Could this be a new creature?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: If there are Those We Don’t Speak Of in the
woods, could there not be yet another creature, similar, but different
to our own creatures.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: I suppose it is possible. Thank you
Beatrice.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: I beg your pardon…</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: Is it true, about Lucius and Ivy?</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: There are whispers all over the
village.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: We were informed early this morning of their
intentions.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: It is amazing to witness which two people
love chooses to unite. It follows no rules.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: No, it doesn’t.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: God bless them both.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Thank you dear. Please ask the next person to
enter.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: What’s happened?</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: Is this about Ivy and myself?</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: I know you are very fond of her.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: I know she is fond of you. There are
different types of love Noah –</p>
<p><strong>noah and lucius stand eye to eye. beat. noah pulls out
the</strong>: BLADE FROM LUCIUS’ STOMACH.</p>
<p><strong>noah, still crying, changes the grip on his knife and
bends</strong>: DOWN OVER LUCIUS.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Noah, you’ll be late for the meeting hall.
Would you like your father to walk you there?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Noah?</p>
<p><strong>we are moving through the percy cabin. the main sitting
room</strong>: IS EMPTY. WE SEE THE FRONT DOOR IS OPEN. WE MOVE TOWARDS
IT.</p>
<p><strong>there is a noise, a creaking that grows in strength. we
move</strong>: TO THE FRONT DOOR AND THEN THROUGH IT.</p>
<p><strong>we are on the porch. the creaking sound is very loud.
we</strong>: TURN AND SEE NOAH SEATED IN A ROCKING CHAIR. HE ROCKS BACK
AND FORTH CREAKING ON THE NOISY WOOD OF THE PORCH.</p>
<p><strong>noah</strong>: The bad color.</p>
<p><strong>flustered man</strong>: I beg your pardon –</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>flustered man</strong>: There has been an accident.</p>
<p><strong>kitty</strong>: Helen what is it?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Noah Percy was found with quarts of blood upon
his clothes and hands… The blood was not his own and he will not speak
as to whose it is.</p>
<p><strong>kitty</strong>: Dear God in heaven.</p>
<p><strong>kitty</strong>: Ivy, where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Eighteen – nineteen – twenty –</p>
<p><strong>there is a commotion all around her. she hears knocks
and</strong>: DOORS OPENING AND CLOSING. ELDERS YELL OUT.</p>
<p><strong>august</strong>: Are there any injured in here?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Has anyone been hurt in this home?</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: – Twenty-two – twenty-three.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Lucius?</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Lucius Hunt you answer me this moment!</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Do not let Alice Walker come here.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: I cannot see his color.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. clack</strong>: It is best to be direct at moments such
as these. He has suffered a great deal. He is very weak. He may pass at
any time.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. clack</strong>: Please give him all your prayers and
good thoughts. He will hear them.</p>
<p><strong>from inside there is a sudden burst of screams. it dies
down</strong>: TO A WHIMPER.</p>
<p><strong>tabitha</strong>: I am very worried for Alice. She will not
speak.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Her son is to die. There is nothing to
say.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: There is nothing to say. Victor am I correct
in that statement?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: There were six wounds inflicted. Five of the
wounds are not life threatening. The sixth was made to the chest. When I
listen to his breastplate, I cannot hear airflow as I should. The sound
is deadened. He is having greater and greater difficulty breathing.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: What can be done to mend him?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: We can only pray.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: If there were no limitations, what could be
done?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: What are you asking me?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Is there anything at all that can be done to
mend the boy?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Please Victor, would you be so kind as to
answer my question…</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: There is one other option.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Has he passed?</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: No. You know the moment I heard my child’s
vision had finally failed her, and that she would forever be blind, I
was sitting in that very chair. I was so ashamed.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: For not protecting you. Could we take a walk
Ivy?</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: What do you know about your grandfather?</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: He was the wealthiest man in the towns.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: That he was. He had a gift for that. If he
was given one dollar, in less than a fortnight he would have turned it
into five. You do not know of money. It is not a part of our life here.
Money can be a wicked thing. It can turn men’s hearts black… Good men’s
hearts. My father could not see this. For all his gifts, he was a poor
judge of a man’s character. Your grandfather was a good man Ivy. He had
a laugh that could be heard three houses away. He used to hold my hand
as I hold yours. He taught me strength and showed me love and told me to
lead when others would only follow. Your grandfather James Walker, died
in his sleep. A man put a gun to his head and shot him while he dreamed.
I tell you this, so you will understand some of the reasons for my
actions and the actions of others. You are a strong one Ivy. You lead
when others would follow. You see light when there is only darkness. I
trust you among all others.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Thank you father.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Ivy do you know where you are?</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: At the old shed that is not to be used.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Ivy…</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Yes, father.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Do your best not to scream.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>we are in the darkness of a shed. light pours in as
edward</strong>: OPENS THE DOOR. He steps in.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: There is an odd smell.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: It is ahead of you.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: I cannot explain in words. It is just a few
steps.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: – Those We Don’t Speak Of.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Do not be frightened. It is only farce.</p>
<p><strong>we see in the darkness now. hanging from wooden rafters
are</strong>: NINE OR TEN SUITS OF FUR AND CLAWS. EACH ONE HAS A HUMP –
EACH HAS DARK AND LIFELESS EYES.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: There did exist rumors of creatures in these
woods. It is in one of the history books I used to teach in the
towns.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: The ceremony of meat.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: We remove it ourselves. An elder is always
assigned.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: The drills? They are farce too?</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: We did not want anyone to go to the towns
Ivy.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: What about the animals? The skinned ones? Are
the elders responsible for that too?</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: It was not us. We do not know what did
that.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: On this paper has been written a tool of
medicine. It is common in the towns.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Lucius Hunt will pass if he does not receive
this soon. He may pass regardless. You are to go with two others and
follow the path near the stream. A half day’s journey will bring you to
a hidden road. There, the two others will wait as you continue. You
alone will follow the hidden road to the end of Covington Woods. You are
to tell no one in the towns where we are and return with haste. You gave
your heart to this boy. His mother is in need. Are you ready to take on
this burden, which, by right, is yours and yours alone?</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>the sound of the door to the cabin opening and closing
can</strong>: BE HEARD.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Alice, I have sent for help.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I have sent Ivy to the towns.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: – You cannot</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: It is all that I can give you. …It is all
that I can give you.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: I accept.</p>
<p><strong>above her. yellow flags snap in the distance on the
either</strong>: SIDE OF HER.</p>
<p><strong>finton</strong>: Christop.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Christop make haste.</p>
<p><strong>christop</strong>: I beg your pardon.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: You needn’t be scared. You were told.</p>
<p><strong>christop</strong>: I will be unable to join you.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: They had costumes Christop.</p>
<p><strong>finton</strong>: Please Christop, do not leave us.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: There is nothing to fear.</p>
<p><strong>christop</strong>: – Then why do you wear the cloak of the
safe color?</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: We will light torches. It will be safe.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Do not worry what will happen. Only what needs
to be done.</p>
<p><strong>christop</strong>: It is forbidden.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Come if you are coming.</p>
<p><strong>august</strong>: I had a difficult time getting away. What is
it?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I have sent Ivy to the towns to retrieve
medical supplies.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. clack</strong>: What have you done?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Lucius has a chance –</p>
<p><strong>mrs. clack</strong>: We have agreed, never to go back -�
never.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: What was the purpose of our leaving? Let us
not forget, it was out of hope of something good and right.</p>
<p><strong>mr. percy</strong>: You should not have made decisions
without us. You have gone too far.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I am guilty Robert. I made a decision of the
heart. I cannot look into Alice’s eyes and see the same look I see in
August’s. It is too painful.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I cannot bare it.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. clack</strong>: You have jeopardized everything we have
made.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Yes I have. I hope I am always able to risk
everything for the right and just cause. If we did not make this
decision -� we could never again call ourselves innocent. And that in
the end is what we have protected here -� innocence. That, I am not
ready to give up.</p>
<p><strong>august</strong>: There is still hope.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Yes there is my dear friend.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. clack</strong>: How could you have sent her? She is
blind.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I sent her because I trust her. And it is in
her blindness that our town’s hope lives.</p>
<p><strong>the overwhelming sound of a down pour echoes throughout
the</strong>: FOREST.</p>
<p><strong>finton</strong>: They are useless.</p>
<p><strong>finton</strong>: Ivy.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: You may go.</p>
<p><strong>finton</strong>: Darkness will be here soon.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: It is always here for me.</p>
<p><strong>finton</strong>: It is not too late to return. There must be
another way to help Lucius.</p>
<p><strong>finton</strong>: Do not pretend you do not feel it. There is
something in these woods. It turns my stomach to rot. The elders
themselves admit there were stories of creatures in these woods long
before they arrived.</p>
<p><strong>finton</strong>: You will be safe. They will not harm you
because you cannot see. They will take pity on you as they took pity on
Noah when he ventured into the woods. They will kill me Ivy. I cannot
stay.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: It is my burden, Finton. You may go.</p>
<p><strong>the sound of thousands upon thousands of cicadas fill
the</strong>: AIR WITH THEIR HIGH PITCHED VIBRATO. THE SOUND SEEMS TO
GET LOUDER AND LOUDER. UNNATURALLY LOUD.</p>
<p><strong>where she steps. her hands go out as she falls. she
grabs</strong>: THE EARTH AS IT SLAMS INTO HER ARMS.</p>
<p><strong>she is hanging on an edge. she tries to pull herself up.
the</strong>: GROUND IS ALL MUD -� SHE BEGINS TO SLIDE. SHE FLAILS AS
SHE DISAPPEARS INTO THE HOLE IN THE FOREST.</p>
<p><strong>we see ivy now, full figure. her cloak and hood is coated
in</strong>: MUD. HARDLY ANY OF THE SAFE COLOR YELLOW CAN BE SEEN.</p>
<p><strong>and then we hear it – the identical sound of a rock
landing</strong>: IN A BED OF LEAVES SOMEWHERE BEHIND HER.</p>
<p><strong>she passes inches from a large tree that would have
crushed</strong>: HER. She keeps running.</p>
<p><strong>hillside covered in red flowers. the bad color blankets

<p><strong>it is also breathing, but it is more animal in nature
-�</strong>: STRONG SNORTING SOUNDS -� HORSE LIKE.</p>

<p><strong>this creature is larger and hairier then the costumes

<p><strong>the creature remains where it is, with its back to us,
rocking</strong>: BACK AND FORTH.</p>
<p><strong>enormous mound of fur. the mound shakes as it breathes
out</strong>: LOUDLY. THE CREATURE LIES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE
TREE.</p>
<p><strong>the creature is now standing next to the tree. we barely
see</strong>: ITS DULL LIFELESS EYES UNDER ITS FUR.</p>
<p><strong>the first blow is fast and sudden. all we see is fur
and</strong>: CLAWS. IVY IS KNOCKED TO THE GROUND VIOLENTLY.</p>
<p><strong>the creature continues past her moving into the woods.
we</strong>: SEE IT START TO TURN BACK ABOUT FIFTY FEET AWAY -� LIKE A
BULL IN A BULL FIGHT.</p>
<p><strong>her own breathing, and the breaking of branches and the
crush</strong>: OF LEAVES FILL HER EARS AS SHE RUNS.</p>
<p><strong>we hear loud movement – galloping in the dry leaves.

<p><strong>the creature’s claws just graze her muddied robe as it
drops</strong>: INTO THE HOLE IN THE WOODS.</p>

<p><strong>we see the creature’s fur is ragged and made up of dozen

<p><strong>the chicken feathers that have filled it’s hump have
spilled</strong>: OUT OVER THE VIOLENTLY SHAPED ROCKS THAT THE CREATURE
IS LAYING ON.</p>
<p><strong>we see the silhouetted figure of ivy standing on the edge

against the bright sky.</p>
<p><strong>the wail is like a scream and it is not human. the
first</strong>: WAIL IS JOINED BY ANOTHER AND THEN ANOTHER.</p>
<p><strong>the screams and wails come from all directions. the sound
is</strong>: OVERWHELMING.</p>
<p><strong>we see what she cannot… the trees in these woods have
holes</strong>: THROUGH THE CENTERS OF THEM. WE WATCH AS WIND TRAVELS
THROUGH THESE HOLES AND CAUSES A SOUND… A SCREAM.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: It is for love that I am here! I beg you to let
me pass!</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: It is for love –</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: His will to live is very strong.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Love of your daughter makes him strong.</p>
<p><strong>we leave edward and tabitha walker in their cabin staring
at</strong>: THE PAIR OF FADED BLUE JEANS EDWARD HOLDS IN HIS HANDS.</p>
<p><strong>we are looking through a truck’s windshield. we see

<p><strong>truck driver</strong>: Are you hurt?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: What was that noise?</p>
<p><strong>truck driver</strong>: What are you doing out here?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Are you from the towns?</p>
<p><strong>truck driver</strong>: Where did you come from?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: The woods. You ought not tell anyone.</p>
<p><strong>truck driver</strong>: You need help or something?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: A doctor of medicine. I need to find these
things. We must hurry.</p>
<p><strong>truck driver</strong>: I have two or three syringes in my
first aid kit. You can have them if you want.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: You have the things written on the paper?</p>
<p><strong>truck driver</strong>: I think so. Is someone sick?</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Twenty-five dollars please.</p>
<p><strong>truck driver</strong>: Twenty-five?</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Pennsylvania Gas Tax.</p>
<p><strong>truck driver</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>truck driver</strong>: Pardon me, but what is that over
there?</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Private property.</p>
<p><strong>truck driver</strong>: Who lives there?</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: No one. It’s for animals. Seventy- two
thousand acres of woods. No one’s loud to step foot in there. They got
it fixed so planes ain’t even allowed over it.</p>
<p><strong>truck driver</strong>: But who lives there now?</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: No one. Ain’t you listening? Walker
family owns it. But they ain’t none of them left. The youngest son, a
history professor disappeared some twenty-five years ago. They got some
estate watching over it now.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Why are you all curious?</p>
<p><strong>truck driver</strong>: Just curious.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Pennsylvania Gas Tax? -� Good one
Paula.</p>
<p><strong>truck driver</strong>: Crazy-fucking-white people.</p>
