<p><strong>911 operator</strong>: 911 operator, what is your
emergency?</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Hello? Can you hear me? Can you speak?</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: …eyes…</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: What? Can you speak up?</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: …her…eyes…</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Sir, what is the nature of your
emergency?</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Sir? Are you injured? Do you need medical
attention?</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: …her eyes…she can’t…</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: She can’t…close her eyes.</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: Dispatch, we have multiple 10-55s, need full
response, 11-41.</p>
<p><strong>camera brings us to closeup</strong>: A PROFILE IN DEEP
SHADOW in the foreground, face tilted obliquely in the wreckage.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Her eyes. That’s how they were. Open like
that. You see?</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: When I found my wife and child dead, my
little girl’s eyes were open. The last thing she saw of this earth were
the faces of the men who took her life. Can you understand that?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yes. Yes, I can.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Can you? Really? You?</p>
<p><strong>cantrell</strong>: Mr. Clyde. I don’t see this helping.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: No? You married? Children?</p>
<p><strong>cantrell</strong>: Divorced. I have a son and daughter. Both
in college.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: My daughter was ten. I married late in
life.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: You, Mr. Price? Married? Kids?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’ve seen the crime scene photos, Mr. Clyde.
Many times. They’re horrifying. But they don’t alter the facts of the
case.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Facts? Those men are guilty. Both of them.
You know they are.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: This isn’t about what we know. It’s about what
we can prove in court.</p>
<p><strong>cantrell</strong>: Things have gone against us. Tainted crime
scene, evidence thrown out…</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Maybe you just haven’t tried hard enough.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Look. We’ve had only one real break in this
case. The fact that one asshole has decided to testify against the other
asshole.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: In return for immunity. So he gets away with
it.</p>
<p><strong>cantrell</strong>: The other man doesn’t. He’ll go down for
the crime. That has to count for something.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Yes. It counts for half. Don’t reward one of
the men who murdered my family. Please.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Mr. Clyde. I can’t claim to know what it’s
like to be in your position. Losing your wife and child. But please try
to grasp how limited our options are. This is how the justice system
works.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Ah. I see my mistake. I came for justice.
Instead I got a system.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Sorry. My fault.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You’re due upstairs in three minutes! You’re
gonna be late!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Thank you, voice of doom.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: We doing the right thing?</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: You even doubt it? C’mon, you didn’t just
tumble off the fucking truck. Do the math…</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: It’s your office.</p>
<p><strong>cantrell</strong>: It’s your decision.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: What are you asking her for? She’s just an
intern.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I am just an intern.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You were top of your class at Yale, don’t give
me that shit.</p>
<p><strong>cantrell</strong>: Young lady. Someday you might have our
jobs. You know the issues of the case before the court. Speak.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Okay. Um. You can take both men to trial,
spend a year and millions of taxpayer dollars, and probably lose. Or you
can cut a deal and at least put one of the men who did the crime on
death row. It’s a no-brainer. You make the deal.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Duh.</p>
<p><strong>cantrell</strong>: When the day comes that you argue a real
case in court, you might refrain from summing up with “duh.”</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I’ll avoid that.</p>
<p><strong>judge burch</strong>: The agreement has been vetted by both
sides? Satisfactory to all?</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Yes, your Honor. Defense approves.</p>
<p><strong>cantrell</strong>: State also approves, your Honor.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Clarence Darby. This document guarantees that
you will provide testimony against Rupert Ames in the matter of which
you were both accused. In return, you will be</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: shielded from further prosecution for those
capital crimes. But you will plead guilty to the lesser charge of
breaking and entering.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: You’ll do a maximum of five years. With
good behavior, you could be out in three.</p>
<p><strong>judge burch</strong>: That also depends on your testimony and
the level of your cooperation.</p>
<p><strong>darby</strong>: Your Honor need not worry on my account. I
assure the court that I am aware of the opportunity I’ve been given. And
I am deeply grateful to all concerned.</p>
<p><strong>darby</strong>: If I may. It has come to my attention that
Rupert Ames has been spreading lies about me to the tabloid press. About
certain alleged activities of which I have no knowledge. Sexual and
otherwise. Libel and slander…yes?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You can always sue him.</p>
<p><strong>darby</strong>: Well, no matter. My tongue will wag in court,
under oath. His tongue will wag in hell.</p>
<p><strong>darby</strong>: He’ll get the chair?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: We don’t do chair. We do needle.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Whoa, Jonas, take my elbow.</p>
<p><strong>cantrell</strong>: I’m not blind. Yet. I’ll do it.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You’re shitty on stairs. At least let me take
the leash so the dog doesn’t pull you down.</p>
<p><strong>cantrell</strong>: No. She needs to imprint on me. Not you,
not somebody else.</p>
<p><strong>cantrell</strong>: That’s the whole point of this phase. She
needs to get the idea that she and I are partners. Then the real
training can begin. Unless you wanna lead me around the rest of my
life.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’ll pass.</p>
<p><strong>darby</strong>: …it was a burglary gone wrong. We thought the
house was empty. Rupert found the woman and child at home and went
crazy. I was stoned and in fear of my own life, so I fled…</p>
<p><strong>cantrell</strong>: Bill! You let all your clients give
testimony on the courthouse steps?</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Hellooo, kettle to pot. Since when do you
shy away from publicity?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Since everything in this case has gone
sideways so far. Tell your boy to save it for the courtroom.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: He’s your boy too now. You tell him.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Asshole.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Dickwad.</p>
<p><strong>cantrell</strong>: Fuckface.</p>
<p><strong>darby</strong>: …and may I say for the record how very sorry
I am that I failed to prevent Rupert Ames from committing those terrible
crimes…</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You good here?</p>
<p><strong>cantrell</strong>: Long as nobody bumps into me.</p>
<p><strong>darby</strong>: …been given a chance to put the drugs and
foul living behind me. To atone for my past failings and weakness of
character. It is a gift given me by God’s grace…</p>
<p><strong>darby</strong>: …and the grace and wisdom of this court. I
cannot thank you enough, sir. I cannot.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Marshal, escort your man, please! Mr. Darby is
done here!</p>
<p><strong>reflected in the mirror</strong>: KELL, Nick’s wife, is just
out of the bath, wearing a robe and toweling her hair.</p>
<p><strong>kell</strong>: Shit day?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Shit day. Better now. How’s she doing?</p>
<p><strong>kell</strong>: Fine. She drove me a little crazy today.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: She was busy?</p>
<p><strong>kell</strong>: In overdrive. Here. Feel.</p>
<p><strong>kell</strong>: Of course she stops kicking the moment you get
home.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I had to say some things to a man today I
didn’t want to say. And I did something I didn’t want to do.</p>
<p><strong>kell</strong>: You didn’t lie to him. Or bullshit him. Or
shine him on.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: None of those things.</p>
<p><strong>kell</strong>: So you had your reasons. You did what you had
to. It’s not your fault the world sucks.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You in there. Listen up. Your mother just said
the world sucks. You may wanna rethink this whole thing. My advice? If
you’re asking? Just stay in there. I promise you, nothing will ever make
as much sense as it does right now…</p>
<p><strong>kell</strong>: What is wrong with you?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: …plus there’s shit you don’t need to know
about. Rap. Internet porn. Madonna’s entire back catalog.</p>
<p><strong>kell</strong>: Did someone drop you on your head? Seriously.
I have swollen ankles and all I do is pee. That baby’s coming out.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Okay. I’m sure you heard that. Then again
there are the Beatles. 70’s funk. Louie. Ella. Be a shame to miss those.
All right, kid. Bring it on. But when you’re old enough for the world to
disappoint you, I hope you won’t blame your old man for bringing you
into this mess. Give me that at least.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Dad?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Huh? Wha–?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: You know what it is?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>kell</strong>: Glad it’s once a year.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Why can’t you be here?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: It’s a work thing. Grownup stuff. You know
that happens sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: But it’s…</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I believe we’ve established that. I let go,
you’ll stop reminding me? We’ll celebrate this weekend. Tonight is all
about your friends. Knock yourselves out, don’t give mom any grief. I’ll
try to be home in time to tuck you in, okay?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Okay. But what are you doing tonight that is
more important than…</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: …my birthdaaaaay.</p>
<p><strong>kell</strong>: Something he’d get out of if he could. Here.
Take lunch. Grab backpack. We go.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Nice evasion. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: How long she have to wear this stupid
thing?</p>
<p><strong>cantrell</strong>: Till the stitches heal. Week or two.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Poor honey. Sucks, doesn’t it? But you’re very
pretty. Yes, you are. Even with a radar dish on your head.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: There they are. Like clockwork.</p>
<p><strong>warden iger</strong>: Rupert Ames. Do you have anything to
say?</p>
<p><strong>rupert</strong>: I’m here. Clarence Darby ain’t. And that
ain’t right. ’Cause that man is evil, ain’t no other way to say it. All
them things he done, and him turn witness against me for it.</p>
<p><strong>rupert</strong>: I did wrong too. I guess I’ll pay up. But it
was always him sayin’ jump and how high, and I just went along. Now he’s
killin’ me and he got you people to do it. And that’s a shame. A goddamn
shame. And… …and I guess that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>rupert</strong>: Ah…ah…AH!</p>
<p><strong>rupert</strong>: Ah–ah–Jesus, don’t that HURT!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Oh, Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>cantrell</strong>: What’s going on? Nick?</p>
<p><strong>cantrell</strong>: Nick, goddamn it, what?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I don’t know!</p>
<p><strong>iger</strong>: We’re still trying to sort through this
thing.</p>
<p><strong>cantrell</strong>: Gentlemen, we face a terrible shitstorm of
scrutiny in the days to come. We need answers. Start with what we
know.</p>
<p><strong>iger</strong>: Lethal injection is a series of drugs given in
a specific order. Somebody had to have replaced one or more of those
ingredients with something else. Industrial solvent? Acid?</p>
<p><strong>dunnigan</strong>: Let’s not guess, let forensics do its
job.</p>
<p><strong>cantrell</strong>: How could the chemicals be switched? We’re
in a goddamn prison!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’ll ask because somebody has to. Is there any
chance, no matter how remote, that this was an accident? A mix-up? Weird
shit happens?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Show them. The bad part.</p>
<p><strong>dunnigan</strong>: Some kind of bypass on the phone
lines.</p>
<p><strong>dunnigan</strong>: Twenty minutes before the execution, the
prison stopped receiving incoming calls and emails. Cell service went
dark too. Signal was probably jammed.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: The bad part. I was just on with the
Governor’s office. He commuted Rupert Ames’ sentence. They were trying
to call us to stop the execution. They couldn’t get through.</p>
<p><strong>dunnigan</strong>: The Governor’s incoming number triggered
this device and shut out any further calls.</p>
<p><strong>cantrell</strong>: Oh, fuck me. Fuck me.</p>
<p><strong>dunnigan</strong>: One more thing.</p>
<p><strong>dunnigan</strong>: This mean anything to you?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Clarence Darby. That’s what he said when he
agreed to testify against the man we executed tonight.</p>
<p><strong>dunnigan</strong>: “His tongue will wag in hell.” Those very
words? It was ten years ago.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I remember it too. Some things stick in your
head.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Check the court transcripts, they’re public
record.</p>
<p><strong>garza</strong>: I know this prick. I’m pretty sure he’s one
of our C.I.s.</p>
<p><strong>dunnigan</strong>: You think, or you know?</p>
<p><strong>garza</strong>: That’s not the name he uses now. But I’m
pretty sure he’s one of Bernstein’s informants.</p>
<p><strong>dunnigan</strong>: Okay, raise Bernstein, I want everything
he’s got, including an address. We roll with tactical.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: How about I ride-along? Give you a fast,
accurate ID on this guy?</p>
<p><strong>cantrell</strong>: Is that necessary?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You said yourself we should move fast. This
thing’ll be all over the morning news cycle. We’d all look a lot better
if we have the right man in custody by then.</p>
<p><strong>aerial shot</strong>: ANGLING DOWN to find a CONVOY OF POLICE
VEHICLES speeding across a bridge.</p>
<p><strong>garza</strong>: That’s him. “Wayne Dunlap.”</p>
<p><strong>dunnigan</strong>: Is that Clarence Darby?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I think so. Hard to tell.</p>
<p><strong>dunnigan</strong>: Jesus, look at this. No wonder Bernstein
loves him.</p>
<p><strong>garza</strong>: We scored a lot of good intel off this
fuckhead through the years. Almost a shame to bag the guy.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: A shame?</p>
<p><strong>garza</strong>: He’s helped us put a lot of bad people behind
bars. Look. Arrests, convictions…</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I can read a C.I. profile. What I see is an
asshole dirty up to his ears in the drug trade. So you cops look the
other way? He gets a free pass as long as he keeps feeding you
convictions?</p>
<p><strong>dunnigan</strong>: Isn’t that what you did ten years ago?
Give this guy a free pass in return for a conviction? Maybe we played
this asshole to our advantage on the street, but you’re the one who put
him there. So, no offense, but you might wanna go fuck yourself a
little.</p>
<p><strong>darby</strong>: Wait…wait…</p>
<p><strong>darby</strong>: Almost. Almost.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: This shit makes you soft, baby.</p>
<p><strong>darby</strong>: Thank you…for stating the
obvious…you…bitch…</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: …rumors the execution did not go well
due to technical flaws, but that has yet to be confirmed…</p>
<p><strong>darby</strong>: “Did not go well.” Way to go, Rupert. You
even fucked up dying.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: You know that guy?</p>
<p><strong>darby</strong>: Knew. Past tense.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Wayne?</p>
<p><strong>darby</strong>: Depends. Who’s this?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Somebody who doesn’t want to see you in jail.
Look out your window. Argue later. Do it now.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: There’s a world of shit coming your way. I’d
get out the back. Now.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Are those fucking cops?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: You ain’t leaving me here!</p>
<p><strong>cop voice</strong>: You! Freeze right there!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Ditch the gun. Wipe the prints.</p>
<p><strong>darby</strong>: Kiss my ass.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I heard six shots. Revolver? Bring extra
ammo?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You shot at cops. That’s attempted murder if
they find the gun on you. You’re in deep enough without that.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You’ll need my help getting out.</p>
<p><strong>darby</strong>: What’ll it cost me?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: We’ll discuss terms later. Go south, across
10th. Past the El tracks. Alley behind the clinic.</p>
<p><strong>darby</strong>: What’s there?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: A cop. Take his ride, he won’t give you any
trouble.</p>
<p><strong>darby</strong>: How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: ’Cause I tasered his ass. You gonna keep
asking questions?</p>
<p><strong>dunnigan</strong>: No way he’s getting out of this
neighborhood.</p>
<p><strong>darby</strong>: Drive.</p>
<p><strong>darby</strong>: Drive, fucker! I’ll put your brains on the
dash!</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Don’t shoot! Don’t hurt me, okay?</p>
<p><strong>darby</strong>: Depends on you. Go.</p>
<p><strong>cop voice</strong>: …air unit three…see no sign of
suspect…think we lost him…</p>
<p><strong>dunnigan</strong>: Keep sweeping the area, unit three. Go
house-to-house. Check everything. Garages, dumpsters, storm drains…</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You gotta be kidding me.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: How could we lose him?</p>
<p><strong>darby</strong>: In the ditch.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: …please…don’t kill me…</p>
<p><strong>darby</strong>: Knees. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: I’ll never see my wife and little girl again.
I’ll never see them.</p>
<p><strong>darby</strong>: It’s fucked up.</p>
<p><strong>darby</strong>: This my guardian angel? Hello?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: I see you got out okay.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: You know why I’ll never see my wife and
daughter again?</p>
<p><strong>benson clyde</strong>: You took them from me.</p>
<p><strong>thru thru</strong>: 38 38</p>
<p><strong>angle</strong>: A head encased in a hood. The hood is pulled
off, revealing Darby – eyes wide, lying on a rough table. Benson Clyde
leans over him, checks his pupils.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Can’t speak?</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Tetrototoxin. Fascinating stuff. It paralyzes
you, but leaves all other neurological functions intact.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: That means you can’t move. Or talk. But you
can see. Hear. Feel. That last one’s important. Feel. You can feel
everything. Got some other items here. Drugs to revive you in case you
pass out. Stuff like that.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Wearing off a little. No worries.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Oh. These. Don’t want you bleeding out. This
will take a while.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Teeth. Balls. Fingers. Maybe toes. Eyelids.
In case you insist on shutting your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Earlier on the phone? I said I’d get you out?
You asked me what it would cost? Well.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: We’ll start with an arm and a leg. Go from
there.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: I’ve been waiting to say that line for years.
But it wasn’t very funny, was it? No. Played much better in my head.
Maybe it’s my delivery.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Gosh. My heart’s beating. You?</p>
<p><strong>female voice</strong>: …unit twenty one, come in…unit twenty
one, please respond…report your location…</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: …and while we were singing karaoke, Ashley was
all dancing around and jumping up and down and suddenly she gets this
look on her face…</p>
<p><strong>kell</strong>: I saw it coming.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: …and suddenly she just went barf. Total puke
moment. And we were all like, ewwww gross! It was so funny…</p>
<p><strong>kell</strong>: Funny for her. I cleaned it up.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I had my “ewwww gross” moment last night
too.</p>
<p><strong>kell</strong>: Hey. I had a house full of shrieking ten
year-old girls.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Hey. I saw a guy’s veins dissolve.</p>
<p><strong>kell</strong>: Honey. It’s not a competition. Okay, you
win.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: …so Tara says that’s what you get for eating
too much cake and that almost made Ashley puke again…</p>
<p><strong>kell</strong>: Delivery.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: I’ll get it!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Oh, shit. We’ve gone national.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Thank you!</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: …the suspect who tasered you last
night…was it the same person who let you out of the trunk this
morning?</p>
<p><strong>hilts</strong>: I never saw a face…either time…he wore a
thing, a face shield…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Sergeant! Sergeant!</p>
<p><strong>young cop</strong>: Come quick! You gotta see this!</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Daddy?</p>
<p><strong>kell</strong>: Oh my God!</p>
<p><strong>kell</strong>: What the hell is this? Jesus Christ, Nick!
Turn it off! Turn it off! It’s okay, baby, I’m here…</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Oh my Lord.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: My daughter is traumatized! She’s only ten!
It’s a goddamn snuff film! In my home!</p>
<p><strong>garza</strong>: Price got a video of it happening delivered
to his house…</p>
<p><strong>dunnigan</strong>: Yeah, we know. Nick, we know. The body’s
been found. The pieces, anyway. Call just came in. In some old shed on a
farm outside the city. About a hundred and fifty acre piece of
property.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Belonging to who?</p>
<p><strong>dunnigan</strong>: Benson Clyde. You have the right to remain
silent…</p>
<p><strong>dunnigan</strong>: …understand your rights as I have
explained them?</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>garza</strong>: Check this shit out.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: He says he’ll only talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Counselor.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Mr. Clyde.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Why so formal? We go way back. Call me
Benson. Or Ben.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Well. I’m here. So?</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: So. Maybe you can explain what this is all
about.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I think that’s obvious.</p>
<p><strong>dunnigan</strong>: You murdered two people. Rupert Ames and
Clarence Darby.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Detective…?</p>
<p><strong>dunnigan</strong>: Dunnigan.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Dunnigan. I thought I’d made it clear I would
only speak to the gentleman across the table from me.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You murdered two people. Rupert Ames and
Clarence Darby.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Darby? I knew about Ames, of course. I’ve
been following the news about his horribly botched execution. But Darby
too? Quite a coincidence.</p>
<p><strong>dunnigan</strong>: Cut the shit. We know you did it. Save
everybody a lot of time and trouble and just confess.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Are you going to continue to insist on being
part of this conversation?</p>
<p><strong>dunnigan</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Fine. Far be it from me to be rude.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Clarence Darby was found on your property. Old
abandoned shed?</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: I didn’t know I had one. It’s 150 acres,
uncultivated. The other day I found a creek I never knew I had. Hunters
trespass all the time. You going to try to pin the dead deer on me
too?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I don’t believe this guy.</p>
<p><strong>cantrell</strong>: That man is frosty.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: It occurs to me that an even moderately
clever person could try to frame me for the murder simply by killing him
on my property. One of Darby’s drug rivals? That’s an unsavory world. A
jury would have to weigh that possibility. What else you got?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: How about video of you dismembering Darby
while he was still alive?</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: That’s odd. See, if I were to do such a
thing, I’d probably wear something so I couldn’t be identified. Some
kind of mask maybe. But you say it’s actually me on the video? Did the
camera capture my good side?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You sick fuck, you sent it to my house! My
daughter saw that video! It fucking traumatized her! She couldn’t stop
sobbing!</p>
<p><strong>dunnigan</strong>: Whoa-whoa, Nick, ease off!</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: No trouble here, Detective, we’re fine. Thank
you, though.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Your daughter is, what, ten now? That’s a
wonderful age. My daughter was always so busy at that age, so
interested, so into everything. Jumping around. I called her “Bean,” she
jumped around so much.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: I am sorry, Nick, that your daughter
experienced that. You’re right. That video should not have arrived that
way. The person who sent it should have thought twice.</p>
<p><strong>dunnigan</strong>: Okay, enough.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Unless there’s hard evidence tying me to
these crimes – forensic or otherwise – why am I here? Why are we having
this conversation?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: We know you did it.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: It’s not about what you know. It’s about what
you can prove in court. Your words. Like when you called it a justice
system. You know the thing about a system, Nick? Any system can be
played.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You think you can play us? You gonna take me
on?</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Clarence Darby did. And I’m much smarter than
he was. Or you.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’m gonna bury you, fucker!</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: That’s it, that’s what I want! That fire in
the belly! That’s what I wanted ten years ago! Do it, Nick! Bury me!</p>
<p><strong>dunnigan</strong>: Sit down! Sit the fuck down!</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Or. Set me free.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Did I stutter? Make your case. Or. Shake my
hand on the courthouse steps and send me on my way. I’ll even make it
easy on you. I will confess, how’s that?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You’re gonna confess.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Let’s start tomorrow after a good night’s
sleep. We’ll all be fresh and rested.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Ten years he’s been planning this? Patient
people make me nervous. This? This freaks me out.</p>
<p><strong>dunnigan</strong>: Is he serious about confessing? What’s his
deal, is he crazy?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Confession or not, we’re gonna nail him on two
counts of first-degree.</p>
<p><strong>cantrell</strong>: Agreed, but softly. Nothing hard- ass, no
grand-standing. Kid gloves.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Kid gloves? He’s a psycho with a power
saw.</p>
<p><strong>cantrell</strong>: Depending on who’s writing the headline,
he’s a grieving husband and father who got revenge on the men who
murdered his wife and child. Public sympathy is to be respected and
feared. This could blow up in our faces if we’re not careful. We can’t
look like we’re pissed off or have an ax to grind. Are we pissed off? Do
we have an ax to grind?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>cantrell</strong>: Then stop acting like it.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Okay. He got under my skin a little. That’s
done.</p>
<p><strong>steadicam two silhouettes</strong>: We’re following Nick and
Sarah through one of the pedestrian tunnels to the street:</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: …background check’s gotta be thorough, I want
to know everything there is to know about this son of a bitch. Get all
the ADAs on it, tell ’em I better not see them sitting around on their
asses or texting their pals…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: How about outside help? That P.I. who helped
us on the Jacovitz case?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yeah, he was good. And Hanson’s always
reliable. But try to limit their hours, okay?</p>
<p><strong>kell</strong>: Well, hello there beauty!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Hey Kell! Hey Emma, how’s my dynamo?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Hi, Sarah!</p>
<p><strong>kell</strong>: We haven’t seen you in so long it’s
ridiculous. When are you gonna come by for a visit?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Who needs a life, right? Talk to your
husband, maybe he’ll give us a day off one of these years.</p>
<p><strong>kell</strong>: Soon, huh? Seriously, we miss you.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Fuck.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I saw her bed empty. Scared the shit out of
me. Don’t know why.</p>
<p><strong>kell</strong>: She had a bad dream. She wanted to sleep with
us tonight.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Daddy…?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: I had a nightmare. That man.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I know. Shhh. We’re all good. You’re safe.
Nobody’s gonna hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>kell</strong>: Especially not that man. Daddy’s gonna put him
in jail forever. That’s what daddy does. He makes sure the bad people
stay locked away.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: I admit I expected something more modern.
That jail downtown?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Filled to capacity. It has been for years.
They had to re-open this for the overflow. Part of it anyway.</p>
<p><strong>garza</strong>: Welcome to the county jail annex. All new
inmates come here. It was in the papers.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Right. Prison crowding. It’s a problem.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: For the record: You’ve waived legal counsel.
You’ve offered to confess to the murders of Clarence Darby and Rupert
Ames. Yes?</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: We’ll get to that. First, what I’d really
like to talk about is the cot in my cell. It’s lumpy. Hardly any
padding? Steel springs? Very uncomfortable?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I know what lumpy means. Sorry to hear it. But
we’re not here to talk about prison conditions, we’re here to talk about
things you’ve done.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Start with things I haven’t done. Like get
any sleep last night. I said let’s begin today fresh and rested. You
recall my words?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What do you want from me?</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: A bed in my cell.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: A bed. In your cell.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Yes, please. One of those Sleep- Matic
adjustables. Those are best.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You want the variable temperature control
too?</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: That would be nice.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Anybody?</p>
<p><strong>dunnigan</strong>: It’s a steel cot! It’s bolted to the
wall!</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: I’m sure they have a wrench.</p>
<p><strong>iger</strong>: We also have rules prohibiting personal items
such as beds.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Let me get this straight. You’re going to let
a bed prevent this confession from taking place.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You looking to deal? All right, how’s this?
How about I don’t kick your fucking teeth down your throat?</p>
<p><strong>cantrell</strong>: Nick.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Sorry, Jonas. Okay, kid gloves. My daughter
slept in our bed last night. She hasn’t done that since she was six. You
gave her nightmares. So excuse me if I don’t feel like cutting any
little deals today.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: My daughter can’t have nightmares, because
she died with Clarence Darby’s breath in her face. You gave him a
reduced sentence and his freedom. All I want is a good night’s
sleep.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: This is bullshit. He’s jerking our chain
big-time…</p>
<p><strong>cantrell</strong>: I can justify the expense.</p>
<p><strong>iger</strong>: It’s not just a bed. Every inmate here will be
on the phone to their lawyer filing lawsuits for equal treatment. Can
you justify that?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: We give him a bed, he confesses, we take the
bed away. At most it’s one night.</p>
<p><strong>cantrell</strong>: We’re talking a high-profile double
homicide. Order the bed.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Switching the drugs was easy…</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: I hacked the Fedex database, diverted the
package to me, made the switch, sent the package on. It’s automated
tracking numbers moving millions of packages daily. Nobody’s questioning
who receives what, or why.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: And the prison phones?</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Get a phone company uniform, hack the prison
database, schedule an official visit. They’ll wave you through the gate,
like they did me. It’s simple if you know how things work. It’s a
system. You learn how it works. You play it. Any system.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I saw him die. That stuff burned his veins. He
suffered terribly.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Score.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Let’s move on to Clarence Darby.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Hey, you like music?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Very much. Why?</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: I could tell. I love music. All of it. It’s
like air in my lungs. So the thing about Clarence Darby is, I want my
record collection and player brought to me. The vinyl discs as well as
CDs.</p>
<p><strong>iger</strong>: Vinyl records and CDs can be broken into
shards. They make excellent weapons. My answer to that one, Mr. Clyde,
is not no, but hell no.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: It’s a legitimate concern.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: How about my ipod and speaker dock?</p>
<p><strong>iger</strong>: The player stays out here. You hand the remote
to the on-duty guard every night at lights out. Those terms aren’t
negotiable.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: I appreciate your compromise.</p>
<p><strong>iger</strong>: You looking to get your ass kicked? By every
inmate on this cellblock. You keep this up, they’ll take it out on you.
Harshly.</p>
<p><strong>iger</strong>: Just trying to keep you alive in here. That’s
all.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: I took his fingers with a bolt cutter. His
toes with a pair of tin snips. His balls with a hacksaw…</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: …his penis with a box cutter. His skin with a
filet knife. His teeth with pliers. His eyes…for those I used my
fingers. Check the video I made. All that will match up. I kept him
alive for an hour, give or take. Time it.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: What now?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: My office types it up, you sign.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: How about a signing bonus? The small
concessions you’ve made so far have kept my cooperation flowing…why not
give me a reward for signing?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You don’t want to sign, don’t sign. We’ve got
you on videotape, we’ll go to trial. In ten years, when your appeals are
exhausted, I’ll attend your execution. I’ll make sure nobody tampers
with the drugs.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Don’t be such a hard-ass, Nick. I don’t want
much. Just a good meal. The food here? Sucks. No offense.</p>
<p><strong>dunnigan</strong>: What do you have in mind?</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: There’s a place in town on Halston. La
Traviata. Ever been?</p>
<p><strong>dunnigan</strong>: It’s a little above my pay grade.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: You know it, don’t you, Nick?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’ve eaten there. So?</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: They cater. Tonight, at 7 p.m., I would like
my meal delivered to my cell from La Traviata. With nice silverware,
crisp linens…</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Not gonna happen.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Because I have no interest in making it
happen. And you have nothing left to bargain with.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: C’mon, Nick. We’ve just started bargaining.
You haven’t even heard what I’m offering yet.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Miss Lowell? Is your laptop still on? Would
you please do a search?</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: William…Baxter…Reynolds.</p>
<p><strong>dunnigan</strong>: Who’s William Reynolds?</p>
<p><strong>cantrell</strong>: Clarence Darby’s defense attorney. He
brokered the testimony deal with us ten years ago. He’s been missing now
since…</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: March of ’06.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Detectives Dunnigan and Garza will like this
offer, Nick. It’ll clear one of their department’s missing- persons
files. And it’ll solve them their third homicide this week.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: How do you think I located Clarence Darby
after he got out of jail and legally changed his name? Reynolds told me
– though it took some convincing.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: You want the location of the body? Tonight, 7
p.m., I get my meal delivered to my cell from La Traviata.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: GPS position is as follows…</p>
<p><strong>voice on radio</strong>: …delta niner foxtrot…GPS coordinates
follow…</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What do we have so far?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: He’s got no next-of-kin. No family since his
wife and daughter were killed…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: He’s a tinkerer. Little inventions and
gizmos…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: …he holds two dozen patents that have made
him a lot of money the last ten years. He’s invested a lot of it in real
estate. Weird stuff.</p>
<p><strong>cantrell</strong>: Weird how?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Properties with no real value. Around
airports, chemical plants. Stuff nobody wants…</p>
<p><strong>convict</strong>: Motherfucker…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: He votes. He gives money to charity, mostly
victim’s funds…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: …but he also gives a big chunk to macular
research.</p>
<p><strong>cantrell</strong>: He donates to eye research?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: RPI. That’s the charity you work with, isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>cantrell</strong>: Huh. Strange.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: …consomm�…sea bass…squab… New York strip,
rare…a variety of pates…</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Rack of lamb?</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: …oh, yes, rack of lamb…</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: You’re bruising the crepes.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Life’s a bitch, then you die.</p>
<p><strong>iger</strong>: …no plates, they break into nice jagged
pieces…nothing sharp, nothing that can be made sharp…no forks, no
knives, no spoons….lose that carafe…we will have no potential weapons of
any kind this evening, thank you…you can eat with your fingers…</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: The guards will think me gauche.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Thanks. Keep digging.</p>
<p><strong>iger</strong>: Idiot.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: I suppose if I don’t share, you’ll beat the
shit out of me. Make me squeal like a piggy. That sort of thing.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Fuckin’ A.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: I wonder what the little people are eating
tonight?</p>
<p><strong>forensic tech</strong>: Okay, let’s see if we can get him out
in one piece…</p>
<p><strong>tight reveal</strong>: His napkin wrapped tightly around his
hand provides padding for his palm. The two earlier bones are already
held between his fingers – he places the third, makes a fist – and the
bones now protrude from his clenched knuckles like a trio of spikes.</p>
<p><strong>forensic tech</strong>: …gently on three…one…two…</p>
<p><strong>davies</strong>: –we’ll have to wait for the autopsy results,
but–</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Agent Davies?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Why do you have him in the dome?</p>
<p><strong>iger</strong>: He killed his cellmate. We had to separate him
out.</p>
<p><strong>cantrell</strong>: What’s wrong with solitary?</p>
<p><strong>iger</strong>: We don’t have the authority. Not without a
court order. This place was re-opened under protest as it is. Some areas
are off-limits to our use – tied up in a legal challenge by the ACLU as
cruel and unusual. Especially solitary. It was nicknamed the
dungeon…</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Get Judge Burch on the phone.</p>
<p><strong>iger</strong>: Nice trick with the rack of lamb. Didn’t see
that one coming.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Why’d you kill your cellmate?</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: I claim self-defense.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Here’s what I think. You suckered us in. You
ordered that meal for the purpose of killing him.</p>
<p><strong>cantrell</strong>: Which makes it premeditated. Again.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: And, again, you’ll have to prove that in
court. As I’ve said before… …make your case. Or set me free.</p>
<p><strong>davies</strong>: Your booby-trap killed two of mine and put
four in the hospital. That brings the total of people you’ve killed to
six – and be advised the Bureau does not suffer losing agents in the
field. We’re done dancing. I have the right to claim jurisdiction here,
do I not, Detective Dunnigan?</p>
<p><strong>dunnigan</strong>: That is correct, Agent Davies.</p>
<p><strong>davies</strong>: So. I’m gonna rendition your ass. Rumor has
it we have places that make Guantanamo look like Disneyland. Don’t
bother packing, you’re gonna disappear.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: You see, Nick? That man is pissed! That’s
what I’m talking about! No deals, no compromise! You see?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I see you totally disconnected from reality,
that’s what I see!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Judge Burch with an answer for you.</p>
<p><strong>judge burch</strong>: I’m the ACLU’s biggest fundraiser in
this state. You wanna put that piece of shit in solitary? Good. As far
as I’m concerned, you can bury him in the bowels of hell.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Thank you, Judge Burch. Consider your court
order signed. Freedom? Not likely. In fact, you just bought a one room
suite in the dungeon. Very exclusive.</p>
<p><strong>iger</strong>: You’ll have it all to yourself – the first man
down there in over twenty years. Quite an achievement.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You’re doing everything wrong. Making all the
wrong moves.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: It would seem that way.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Sam. I know you got hit hard. I know you’re
furious. But I’d like my shot at prosecuting this case. This started
with us. Let me finish it. Give me that chance.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: I’m seeing fire in your belly, Nick. I like
it. Keep going. This is our deal, after all…</p>
<p><strong>cantrell</strong>: Let’s not mistake this! This is not about
the two of you!</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Wake up, blind man! It’s been exactly that
since I watched him shake Clarence Darby’s hand on the steps of the Hall
of Justice ten years ago! The Hall of Justice!</p>
<p><strong>davies</strong>: You wanna take this fuck down? Be my guest.
Whatever you need.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: That’s the spirit, yes! It’s on you now,
Nick. It’s your game to lose. Just don’t screw up. You do, they’ll
scapegoat you. That’s how the justice system works. Good call, Sam.
Making me disappear was a bad idea. You couldn’t have handled the
blowback.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Blowback?</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Cause and effect. Your actions provoke
reactions. The choices you make come back to haunt you. There are things
I’ve set in motion. Dominoes that will fall. Didn’t see the rack of lamb
coming? Start a list. All I can do at this point…if I feel like it…is
stop them from happening. Ready to talk deal?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You’re insane.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: See how insane you think this is. You’re
going to release me from this place with all charges dropped within
twenty four hours…</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Or what?</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Or I start killing everybody.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Clock’s running, Nick.</p>
<p><strong>cantrell</strong>: What can he do? We’ve got him boxed in.
He’s isolated, for God’s sake.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Let’s keep him that way. Strict rules apply.
Law says he gets one hour outside his cell a day, that’s what he gets.
Just one, under heavy guard. The other twenty-three hours, he’s in that
cell, he’s a ghost, he doesn’t exist. No contact whatsoever.</p>
<p><strong>dunnigan</strong>: You think it was a bluff?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: We underestimated him before. I’d like to know
what this prick is capable of. Update on the background check?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Properties, investments, a few small
businesses he owns – a lot of it’s hidden behind false names and shell
companies, but we’re still digging…</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: That’s it? Nothing else unusual?</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: The last twenty years, he’s been Joe Blow
Citizen. But prior to that, we’ve hit a blank spot. He used to do
consulting for the government, but we can’t pin down what.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What kind of government work leaves a blank
spot, Sam?</p>
<p><strong>davies</strong>: I’ll make a few discreet calls. See what I
can find out.</p>
<p><strong>kell</strong>: Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Million miles away. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>kell</strong>: Don’t be. This guy’s really doing a number on
your head, isn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yeah. I guess he is. It’s…killing his
cellmate. I need that to make sense.</p>
<p><strong>kell</strong>: Why? Happens in prison all the time.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yeah, I know, but…we’re not talking some
gang-banger. This man is precise. Does things for a reason.</p>
<p><strong>kell</strong>: He’s psycho. You said so yourself. We saw it
on that video. Psychos don’t need a reason, Nick. They’re just psycho.
Whatever. You’ll figure it out. You always do.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Thanks. I’m a poor excuse, though. It’s date
night. You deserve better. Just wish you’d picked another
restaurant.</p>
<p><strong>kell</strong>: This is our place. You love it here. You
should have said something…</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Have we decided?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Sam? What is it? Not far, maybe six blocks.
I’m having dinner with my wife.</p>
<p><strong>davies</strong>: Two words: doggy bag. Be in your office in
ten minutes. Nick, don’t ask questions. I was on the phone all day.
Believe me when I say we’ve got one shot at this.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: He’s coming here?</p>
<p><strong>davies</strong>: So I’m told. It’s called inter-agency
cooperation, but don’t ask me what agency because I wouldn’t know. This
isn’t even back-channels, this is Theseus in the fucking Labyrinth. I
just blew thirty years’ worth of favors today calling in this one chit.
I hope it’s worth it.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yes. Yes, we’re all here. Downstairs? Okay.
Understood. He said not to take the elevator.</p>
<p><strong>spook</strong>: That’s good there.</p>
<p><strong>spook</strong>: Which one of you is Davies?</p>
<p><strong>spook</strong>: You must be well thought of, Agent Davies. I
don’t do this. But I was asked nicely by the right people. They briefed
me on your problems with Benson Clyde.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What are we dealing with?</p>
<p><strong>spook</strong>: Things I can neither confirm nor deny. Things
of which, if I’m asked, I will disavow any knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>cantrell</strong>: You gotta be kidding me with this guy.</p>
<p><strong>spook</strong>: He’s not. Tell me you grasp the implication
of what I’ve said, or we’re done here.</p>
<p><strong>cantrell</strong>: Yeah. Okay. I get it.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What was Clyde? Some kind of spy?</p>
<p><strong>spook</strong>: Spooks like me are a dime a dozen. Clyde was
a brain. He ran a think- tank, inventing things for use in the field.
Ways to kill people. You need to get rid of somebody. It’s not a
situation where you can get close. What do you do?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Ask Clyde?</p>
<p><strong>spook</strong>: That’s right. Ask Clyde. And he’d figure
something out. Gizmos, strategy. He was good at it.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: How good?</p>
<p><strong>spook</strong>: You play chess?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yeah. Tournament level in college, matter of
fact.</p>
<p><strong>spook</strong>: In my line, we use an aptitude profile based
on chess. A tournament- level player like you can think five to eight
steps ahead of an average player, did you know that? Me, I think about
ten steps ahead, so I’d take you in a game.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What about Clyde?</p>
<p><strong>spook</strong>: Off the charts. If you’re eight steps ahead,
he’s twenty. Or fifty. He’s already got the game won on the first move,
you don’t even know you’re playing yet. This cellmate he killed? You
think that was random? Bullshit. That was a pawn taken off the board. If
I were you, I’d be trying to figure out what the move was.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I have been. Any thoughts?</p>
<p><strong>spook</strong>: Top of my head? Was the cellmate ever
connected with this case? Or with Clyde? Was anybody else in that
facility? Guards? Cons? The janitor? Any connection at all, no matter
how remote. Because if Clyde says he has things in play, he does.</p>
<p><strong>davies</strong>: Like what? He’s locked up. What can he
do?</p>
<p><strong>spook</strong>: You’re an average chess player, aren’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>davies</strong>: Actually, I kind of suck.</p>
<p><strong>spook</strong>: I can tell. But I like your tie.</p>
<p><strong>davies</strong>: Thank you. Father’s Day.</p>
<p><strong>spook</strong>: There’s this tie – we call it the Albert,
after Albert DeSalvo. They tiptoe in one night, thread a piano wire with
a ratchet gizmo into one of your ties. Sounds crazy, but trust me it
works. You put your tie on and all day long it slowly tightens. You
don’t even notice it’s cutting off the blood-flow to your brain. Then
you drop dead. Brain-dead or plain dead, doesn’t much matter at that
point. Clyde invented that.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Daddy!</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Mom said I could stay up late. Wanna play
Scrabble?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Let me talk to mom first.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Sorry about date night.</p>
<p><strong>kell</strong>: It’s fine. You learn anything?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Thing or two.</p>
<p><strong>kell</strong>: Nick?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Hey, I was thinking. Maybe you could pack an
overnight bag for you and Emma in case you need to…you know…spend the
night in a hotel. Or something.</p>
<p><strong>kell</strong>: Why would we wanna do that?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No reason. It’s like a fire-drill thing. You
know. In case.</p>
<p><strong>kell</strong>: Honey?</p>
<p><strong>kell</strong>: What the hell are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Daddy?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: It’s okay, baby – I’m fine, I promise. Go back
to your game.</p>
<p><strong>kell</strong>: Seriously, Nick. What the fuck.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Nothing. I got paranoid for no reason, that’s
all. I’m fine now. I can’t believe I let that son of a bitch Clyde get
to me like that.</p>
<p><strong>kell</strong>: Are you in danger? Are we?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’m sure we’re fine.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’ll make goddamn sure. Sarah, roust the ADAs.
Tell ’em we’re pulling an all-nighter.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Ready to turn this place upside down?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: See if there’s anybody locked up here – or
working here – ex-cop, witness for the prosecution – anybody who might
have had anything to do with the original Darby-Ames case, or has any
previous history with Benson Clyde. Start with the cellmate. Flag
anything, no matter how insignificant it seems…</p>
<p><strong>jameson</strong>: This could take days.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: We boring you, Jameson? You got someplace to
be?</p>
<p><strong>jameson</strong>: No, Miss Lowell.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Weekend plans? Cancel ’em! I don’t wanna hear
any shit about it! Clack-clack, Jameson. Clack-clack.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>dunnigan</strong>: It used to be a Sleep-Matic adjustable
bed. Now it’s not.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What do you have?</p>
<p><strong>team leader</strong>: Rocky Mountain Way. Joe Walsh. What do
you want from me, it’s a fucking ipod.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Tear it apart, make sure. Memory. Speakers.
Wiring. Everything.</p>
<p><strong>fbi forensic</strong>: Blood stain. Few fibers. That’s
it.</p>
<p><strong>convict</strong>: Warden, man, whassup?</p>
<p><strong>iger</strong>: Everybody back to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I want to see him.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: You’re up early. Trouble sleeping?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: It was a good bluff. But you’re done. Fucking
with my head. Scaring my family half to death. Done.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Amazing, isn’t it? How primal that is. That
pull? What a man is capable of when it comes to his family?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You strip away all the polite shit, that’s
what we’re really about.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: I hope you never face what it is to lose
them, Nick. It’s like dying yourself. There’s nothing worse.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Good night, Ben.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Good night, Nick.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Is it casual Friday? I’ve never seen you not
wear a tie.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: We dug pretty deep for one night. Still got a
ways to go, but on a first look? Nothing. Nada. Zip.</p>
<p><strong>iger</strong>: Well, that’s good news.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: So far. Now we double-down. Make absolutely
certain. Let them all sleep a few hours, then bring ’em back for round
two.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Due diligence. My middle name.</p>
<p><strong>davies</strong>: Fellas. For once, glad not to be of
assistance.</p>
<p><strong>dunnigan</strong>: Love it when they cry wolf.</p>
<p><strong>dunnigan</strong>: Miss Lowell! Lost something!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You’re gonna be all right.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Baby. Listen. Don’t be worried or scared. But
I want you to pack those overnight bags… I don’t have time to explain
now. Just do it, okay? I’ll call you back as soon as I can – please,
honey, I gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>davies</strong>: Each car had an explosive charge on the gas
tank.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: He’s got someone working with him. On the
outside. He’s got to.</p>
<p><strong>davies</strong>: Not necessarily. Everything looks
pre-rigged.</p>
<p><strong>bomb expert</strong>: We found a short-range transmitter
beacon buried outside the prison wall. When your people showed up here
and drove in through the gate, the signal armed the bombs.</p>
<p><strong>dunnigan</strong>: He could have planted those bombs a month
ago.</p>
<p><strong>cantrell</strong>: No…no, we’ve got two dozen ADAs on
payroll. Those eight were picked last night on the spur of the moment.
How could he know which eight would show up?</p>
<p><strong>davies</strong>: He didn’t. Our people just found bombs on
every car in your ADA pool. All two dozen. We’re disarming those
now.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: I want a phone in my cell. If I’m conducting
my own defense, it would be useful. Also in case you and I need to be in
touch, Nick.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Your twenty four hours are about up. In
return for the phone, I’ll extend you another twelve hours.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: If not?</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: How many more people die while you stand
around dithering? How many do you get killed before my point starts
sinking in?</p>
<p><strong>cantrell</strong>: Motherfucker! Whatever point you had was
lost long ago! Eight kids dead in that yard, most of them just out of
college! Eight! I have to talk to their families. I have to try to
explain why their loved ones are dead.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: I’ve been waiting for my explanation for ten
years. So far…</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: If it hasn’t dawned on you, this is a war. As
in any war, there will be collateral damage. The question, as always, is
how much damage you’re willing to take before you withdraw.</p>
<p><strong>dunnigan</strong>: Maybe I got a better idea. Maybe we end
this war right now. Fourteen people dead! I have to say this out loud?
Prisoners die in custody all the time. Attacking a guard. Trying to
escape. Shit like that.</p>
<p><strong>dunnigan</strong>: Don’t tempt me.</p>
<p><strong>garza</strong>: Jesus Christ, man, dial it back…</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Do it. It would be decisive. Stupid, but
decisive. Can you handle the blowback, Detective? The “shit like
that?”</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Put the gun away! Are you crazy?</p>
<p><strong>dunnigan</strong>: It’s an option. All I’m saying. Risk the
blowback. Ride it out.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: We’re not risking anything. Or letting him
tear us down. You’re not getting us to throw out the rules, like you. No
way.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: I like rules. I’ve wanted you to follow them
from the start. Like the one that says you prosecute a man who murders
my family. So. Rules. A phone buys you another twelve hours. But if you
haven’t cut my deal and let me go by the deadline…</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What? What then?</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: I’ll kill someone in this room.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Eenie…meenie…miney…moe…</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: …my mother…told me…to pick…a person…and
that…person…is…</p>
<p><strong>cantrell</strong>: Who’s he pointing at?</p>
<p><strong>cantrell</strong>: Fuck him. Let him try.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: That’s not helpful! We have fourteen dead! You
could ask them what he’s capable of, but they’re in no position to
answer.</p>
<p><strong>cantrell</strong>: Point taken.</p>
<p><strong>davies</strong>: We’ll give him his phone. We’ll tap in and
monitor every call.</p>
<p><strong>dunnigan</strong>: Buys us another twelve hours, we could use
that right now. That puts the deadline at… …about 7:30 tonight.</p>
<p><strong>cantrell</strong>: Shit. I’ll be in front of a room full of
lawyers. The A.B.A. dinner. I’m the keynote speaker.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No way. Find a replacement.</p>
<p><strong>dunnigan</strong>: Until his deadline passes, you’re in
protective custody. Not negotiable.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: And have them switch the location of that
dinner.</p>
<p><strong>cantrell</strong>: That’s last minute.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Exactly. He could have gotten your schedule in
advance – been planning to take you out at the dinner along with
everybody else. That eenie- meenie act could have been horseshit. We
have to get a few moves ahead. Plan for every contingency.</p>
<p><strong>dunnigan</strong>: This way, Mr. Cantrell. Garza, you’re with
Mr. Price.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Hey baby – no, I’m fine. Really. Honey, calm
down…</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Our shit just hit the fan in a big way – we’re
all over the news… Yes, all eight died. Sarah’s in surgery right now…
…they think so, but… …okay, I’ll meet you there. Love you.</p>
<p><strong>bomb expert</strong>: You’re good. Car’s been swept.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Of course it has. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>garza</strong>: Go around. I’ll get us in back.</p>
<p><strong>garza</strong>: Keep the press off this floor,
understand?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Any word?</p>
<p><strong>kell</strong>: She’s in surgery now. They’re saying she’ll be
okay.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Thank God. That’s good.</p>
<p><strong>kell</strong>: Good? You’ll have to explain the good part,
Nick. I’m missing it. This is crazy. What if something happened to you?
What would I say to Emma? What would we do?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You didn’t lose me. You won’t. Does the school
know we’re pulling Emma out of class?</p>
<p><strong>kell</strong>: I called, yeah, but – I’d rather be here for
Sarah when she wakes up. Nick – and for you. I want to do something…</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You are. Getting our daughter out of harm’s
way. And yourself. Detective. Will you escort my wife, please? There’s
not much time. I’ll be there to see you off. Okay? Please?</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: …reporting live from a tense scene at City
Hall…we have confirmation of earlier reports that eight people with the
district attorney’s office were killed this morning in an explosion at
the County Correctional Annex in George Hill…</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: …details are sketchy at this point, and
names are being withheld…</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Sarah’s fine. That’s the good news.</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: Oh, God, that’s a relief… Miss Lowell is
okay…she’s okay…</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: We’ve been getting calls from upstairs. The
mayor’s people. Someone from our office has to make a statement to the
press. With Mr. Cantrell absent, the mayor wants you to do it.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Royce…how much petty cash do we have in the
safe?</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: I don’t know…four thousand?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Give it to me. And your cell phone. I need to
borrow it for a few days.</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: What do you want me to tell the mayor?</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: We in the D.A.’s office are still reeling
from the events of this morning, as you can imagine. It’s a tragic day
for us…for our city…</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: I wanna see Sarah…</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Hey, hey…she’s fine, don’t be scared. That’s
not allowed. And there’s no reason for it.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: This sucks.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Why do we have to go?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: ’Cause your mom wants to see a few Broadway
shows. You gonna begrudge her that?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: You’re kinda full of shit, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Okay, you’re right. Maybe I am a little. But
only a little. The part you can believe is that this is all going to be
fine. Sarah, us. I mean it. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No credit cards. Too easy to track. Meals,
hotel, whatever – pay cash.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’ll keep this. It can be traced. Use this one
instead. Don’t answer unless you see it’s me.</p>
<p><strong>kell</strong>: Anything else?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>kell</strong>: Emma’s right. This sucks.</p>
<p><strong>kell</strong>: Be goddamn careful.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>cantrell</strong>: Nick? These guys won’t even let me pack a
bag. Not even a toothbrush.</p>
<p><strong>davies</strong>: We have granules of an unidentified
substance in the ice-maker…</p>
<p><strong>davies</strong>: I’m betting something lethal.</p>
<p><strong>tech #1</strong>: Like this salt. Not sodium chloride.
Potassium chloride. It’s a neuro-blocker, stops the heart – they use it
in lethal injections. You’d be dead before you got up from the
table.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’m telling you, Clyde has someone working
with him. Someone on the outside.</p>
<p><strong>cantrell</strong>: Who? Who could he have?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Somebody from his past. Could be that spook we
met on the stairs, for all we know – he’d know how to plant this
shit…</p>
<p><strong>cantrell</strong>: Him? No–why would Clyde let him come talk
to us?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: To fuck with our heads? To get us to bring in
our ADAs so he could blow them up?</p>
<p><strong>dunnigan</strong>: It would be a Clyde move. But it’s not
proof. Could he have planted this stuff in your house before he was
arrested?</p>
<p><strong>cantrell</strong>: I–I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Jonas, think – last few days, have you used
any ice? Any salt?</p>
<p><strong>cantrell</strong>: I don’t use salt–my cholesterol. Ice?
Yeah–not long ago.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Before or after he was arrested?</p>
<p><strong>cantrell</strong>: I don’t remember! You track your use of
ice, Nick? You keep a daily log?</p>
<p><strong>tech #2</strong>: Heads-up! Looks like polonium here. In his
tea pot. Same way the Russians killed Litvenenko. Took him two weeks to
die. It’s an exotic isotope. All you need is a trace amount. Rips
through your organs and bone marrow.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’ll buy you a new toothbrush.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Holy shit.</p>
<p><strong>cantrell</strong>: Nice?</p>
<p><strong>davies</strong>: I’m actually a little jealous Clyde didn’t
pick me.</p>
<p><strong>dunnigan</strong>: It’s the presidential suite. Last person
who stayed here was actually a president. Of a country. Security here is
amazing.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: It’s not bad, Jonas. I think you can muddle
through.</p>
<p><strong>davies</strong>: You’re muddling with him. I don’t want you
back at your house until my people sweep it. You need pajamas, buy some
in the shop downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: The background check my office was compiling –
these properties we think Clyde owns? If he is working with somebody,
they could be operating out of any of these. We should check them.</p>
<p><strong>dunnigan</strong>: I’ll try to wrangle additional manpower.
Big job.</p>
<p><strong>davies</strong>: No shit. This is quite a list. Over forty
locations?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: It’s not even complete. Sarah was in the
middle of it – untangling property ownership from under assumed names,
shell companies. She’s the expert on all that.</p>
<p><strong>cantrell</strong>: Fellas… I’m grateful for all your efforts.
I just wanted to say it.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Save it for tonight. Hope you’re in the mood
for Chinese takeout.</p>
<p><strong>cantrell</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: That stuff in your house – it’s all gone too
far. I started this. I owe everybody at least one last try at defusing
it.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Interesting location you’ve chosen.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I thought we’d have some privacy.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: For what? A talk? Or… Maybe you’ve decided to
take Detective Dunnigan’s advice.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Be the perfect place for it. Outside the wall.
Look like you were shot trying to escape.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: You have some kind of signal worked out? You
scratch your nose and blam, I’m a goner?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Something like that.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Might solve all your problems. What’s
stopping you? Afraid of the blowback?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No. It’s to prove a point. Just because I have
the power, doesn’t mean I have to use it.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Ah. Nice. Good one.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: One can show mercy.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Mercy. Right.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yeah. So why don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: I think we’ve come a little too far for that,
haven’t we, Nick? I mean, what do I say? Sorry, my bad? Which way to the
execution chamber?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Don’t give me that. Death doesn’t scare
you.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Yeah, but…we’re in the flow of this now. You
cry havoc, you let slip the dogs of war, you go with it. You don’t just
stop because someone says hey wait. By then the dogs are dragging
you.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Until one side admits defeat. What if I did
that? What if I said… …you were right. I was wrong. What if I say I
should have prosecuted both men ten years ago?</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: I’d say you’re making progress. You should
have, you know. Prosecuted both.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’d have lost.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: With your head held high. And without any
blame from me.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yeah… She is? Great news. I’ll stop on my way
back. And Royce? Put some get- well flowers in her room, they sell ’em
in the lobby. Thanks. Six hours in surgery.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: But she’s okay – good. Miss Lowell is a fine
young woman. Oh, hey…your wife and little girl get out of town all
right?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You asking that question makes me want to
scratch my nose.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Just a guess. It’s what I would do. Get ’em
out, make sure they’re safe. C’mon. Like I’d ever have hurt them
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: There are limits. Even in war. I may be many
things, Nick. But I’m not Clarence Darby. I’m not Rupert Ames. I’m not
that kind of monster.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What kind are you?</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Not the kind who’d hurt your wife and child.
Christ, look at me. Mine were my salvation – then they were killed – and
all I had left was this. Life without them in this fucking charnel-house
world.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: It hurt to lose them, didn’t it? Your family.
Even knowing they’d come back.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Imagine knowing they wouldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I can’t. I can’t imagine that.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Good. I envy you. For me, knowing mine won’t
come back is the only thing that’s crowded my thoughts for ten years. If
I could take a rusty knife and cut out that part of my brain, I
would.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I won’t make any more deals with murderers. If
hearing that makes a difference…if that was the point of all this…you’ve
won.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Counselor. I have no doubt, as we stand here,
that you really believe that. I wish I could. Are we done? You gonna
scratch your nose, or can I go?</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Judge’s chambers.</p>
<p><strong>voice on phone</strong>: Laura? Laura, that you?</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: I’m sorry, Judge Burch is gone for the
evening.</p>
<p><strong>voice on phone</strong>: Dang it. Listen, honey, I flew in
from Galveston for this A.B.A thing Laura invited me to – just got here
and they said it was moved. You got a number, address, anything?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: …tell Hansen we need hard info on those
addresses…don’t let the shell game on ownership title slow him down…at
this point we’ll take educated guesses…</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Hey. Nice flowers. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: How you doing?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: This place has great drugs. Damn. I should’ve
totaled my leg long ago.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: They’re all dead?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’m afraid so.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You’re alive. That counts for a lot. I’m sorry
I put you in harm’s way.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: It wasn’t you. It was that son of a bitch. I
hear he’s threatened Jonas?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: We’re all over it. Jonas is safe – out of
reach.</p>
<p><strong>cantrell</strong>: Who’s winning?</p>
<p><strong>fleming</strong>: Laszlo, the cheatin’ prick…</p>
<p><strong>laszlo</strong>: Yer mama…</p>
<p><strong>garza</strong>: Wanna sit in?</p>
<p><strong>cantrell</strong>: If I had my Braille set, I’d clean you
out. Not much of a game if you have to tell me what my cards are.</p>
<p><strong>garza</strong>: Right…sorry.</p>
<p><strong>cantrell</strong>: People forget. No worries. Enjoy your
game, fellas.</p>
<p><strong>fleming</strong>: Need help? Want one of us should walk you
down?</p>
<p><strong>cantrell</strong>: I’m good. Unfamiliar places take me a
little longer. But I get there.</p>
<p><strong>garza</strong>: Holler if you need anything. Okay, who’s in,
who’s out…</p>
<p><strong>m.c.</strong>: Good evening. Sorry for any confusion our
last-minute change of location might have caused…</p>
<p><strong>m.c.</strong>: …please join me in a warm welcome for our
keynote speaker this evening, Judge Laura Burch…</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: …yes, you pain in the ass, of course I got
your kung-pao…you think I’d forget…just don’t give Betsy any, I can’t
deal with dog farts all night…</p>
<p><strong>cantrell</strong>: How long, man, I’m starving…</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’m minutes away. Relax.</p>
<p><strong>cantrell</strong>: It’s okay. It’s gonna be okay.</p>
<p><strong>judge burch</strong>: …Jonas was upset not to be here with
you tonight…a personal matter came up…but he wanted me to give you all
his fondest regards…</p>
<p><strong>cantrell</strong>: There. That’s better.</p>
<p><strong>fast cut</strong>: Judge Burch and those around her reacting
as the glare of the rocket approaches in a heartbeat –</p>
<p><strong>fleming</strong>: …we need help up here…</p>
<p><strong>garza</strong>: Jesus Christ. What the fuck hit us?</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: We’re worldwide news this morning. Almost
twenty dead, among them some of this country’s top attorneys. I had
friends in that room. Hell, I almost attended myself.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: The second explosion. I saw a rocket fired.
Clyde does have somebody on the outside.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: What you saw or think you saw is beside the
point. What matters is that the FBI wanted to rendition this man out of
my city. The reason he’s still here causing havoc is you. You wanted to
prosecute this case. Your ambition kept him here and provoked this
tragedy.</p>
<p><strong>dunnigan</strong>: …not entirely fair…</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Detective. Your job is hanging by a thread.
I’d think a man of your experience would know when to keep his mouth
shut and his ass covered.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: When I go in front of the cameras today –
unlike some people who seem unwilling to do so when asked – I’m going to
make goddamn sure the media doesn’t hang this abject disaster around my
neck. Why? Because I’m hanging it on yours. You’re done. Gone. Fired.
Non- existent. Get the fuck out.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Hey. Some legal team from the mayor showed up
here this morning. I hear you’re off the case. Told you they’d scapegoat
you, didn’t I? Nick? You there?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: How’d you kill Jonas? I know about the second
explosion, I saw the contrail, so I know you got somebody working for
you. But the first explosion – how?</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Say you find a guy with a bad cocaine
problem. Hungry ex-wives. Greedy mistress. Heavy gambling debts.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Say that guy’s a veterinarian. You hand him a
million in cash, he’ll do what you ask. Especially if he’s looking to
blow town for good…</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: It was…inside the dog?</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: You own the vet, you own the dog. Explosive
wasn’t even that big. Stuff I use, it didn’t have to be. Hidden in plain
sight. That’s my specialty. Haven’t you figured that out yet?</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: What’s next for you? Mulling career options?
I suppose law is out.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’m trying to get over my friend being dead.
Aside from that, fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Fair enough. I’ll miss you Nick. It was a
good dance.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Didn’t bring your family back, though, did it?
Has it made you feel better? All this? You done making your point?</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Just warming up. This is Clausewitz shit, my
friend. Total war.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: I’m gonna pull the whole thing down. I will
topple the gleaming pillars and drag the whole fucking diseased, corrupt
temple down on my head. Stay tuned. It’ll be Biblical.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: …going live now to City Hall where Mayor
Tilden is about to make a statement…announcing, we’re told, among other
things, the dismissal of District Attorney Nick Price…</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Thank you all for gathering on this solemn
and anxious occasion…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: We got the latest batch of background in.
Hansen and the other guy did some good work here–</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Sarah. Give it a rest. It’s over. We’re done.
I’m done. The mayor is nailing my coffin shut. The best thing you can do
right now is distance yourself from me as much as you can – see what you
can salvage of your career.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: This lists over fifty shit-value properties
in industrial zones that nobody in their right mind would want to own –
stuff around chemical plants, factories. All are owned by Benson Clyde.
Look at twenty-two.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: “Joe’s Lube-and-Drive Garage.” Went out of
business in ’94. Now why would Joe’s extinct Lube- and-Shit Garage be of
the slightest possible fucking interest to you, me, or anyone?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: The garage, not so much. But the address.
Look at the location.</p>
<p><strong>fast cuts</strong>: Nick searching…behind shelves…the
toilet…in closets…the grimy little office…</p>
<p><strong>in blackness, we hear</strong>: Boop-boop-boop…a cell being
dialed. The line RINGING. A voice answering:</p>
<p><strong>dunnigan</strong>: Dunnigan.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Do we finish this tonight?</p>
<p><strong>dunnigan</strong>: Nick? Jesus… Look. No hard feelings, but
there is no “we.” You’re radioactive. I can’t even be seen talking to
you…</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I know who he’s got on the outside. I’ll ask
again. Do we finish this tonight?</p>
<p><strong>dunnigan</strong>: All units. Subject vehicle is on the
move.</p>
<p><strong>dunnigan</strong>: Everybody maintain distance.</p>
<p><strong>voice #1</strong>: Maintain two thousand foot ceiling…</p>
<p><strong>voice #1</strong>: Subject vehicle turning south off of
Hudson…into an alley…</p>
<p><strong>dunnigan</strong>: Hang back…hang back…</p>
<p><strong>voice #2</strong>: I got a white van…large cube type…think he
switched vehicles… moving north again on Hudson…</p>
<p><strong>dunnigan</strong>: Five and six, stick with that building in
case he’s trying to cowboy us. All other units, stay with the van…</p>
<p><strong>voice #3</strong>: I have visual on van. Logo on side reads
“Nomos Custodial Services.”</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Where the hell is he going?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You don’t suppose Nomos Custodial has a
service contract with City Hall, do you?</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: Mr. Nomos! Ain’t seen you
around.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Ted…had to get that vacation in. Visited my
sister in the Keys…</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: Nice. Good for you.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Hey, what’s all that hoopla at the main
entrance?</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: Mayor’s got a big fuckin’ thing.
Thousand dollar a plate whatever. They say the Governor might come.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: I’ll stay out of their way.</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: They’re up on six, avoid that floor.
They got more security than God…</p>
<p><strong>dunnigan</strong>: What floor?</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: I told him to avoid six… There…</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: That’s the main courtroom on
five.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: That’s right below the ballroom. The Mayor’s
event.</p>
<p><strong>tac leader</strong>: Subject in sight. Do we take him?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No. Let him go. We know where to find him.
Let’s get to that courtroom.</p>
<p><strong>dunnigan</strong>: I hope you know what the fuck you’re
doing. Negative. We’re letting him go. All units hang back. Repeat. We
are letting the subject go.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: There.</p>
<p><strong>davies</strong>: Don’t touch it! Could be motion
sensitive!</p>
<p><strong>davies</strong>: I need light!</p>
<p><strong>voice #4</strong>: I have visual…suspect leaving the
building…different service exit…</p>
<p><strong>davies</strong>: Crap. Explosives. Nasty ones.</p>
<p><strong>dunnigan</strong>: What? C-4?</p>
<p><strong>davies</strong>: C-4 is for girl scouts. This is malglinite.
Take out the whole floor above us…maybe this entire corner of the
building…</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Can you open it? Disarm it?</p>
<p><strong>davies</strong>: No, we got tripwires. We open this lid,
instant karma’s gonna get us. Don’t see a motion sensor. Trigger looks
simple…dial a cell phone, incoming call arms the trigger – trigger’s set
to count down from forty seconds, then boom. That call comes in, we have
forty seconds to get as far away from this thing as possible.</p>
<p><strong>dunnigan</strong>: Alert the mayor’s security team. Evacuate
those people upstairs – clear that ballroom, go!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>dunnigan</strong>: No? What the fuck are you talking about,
this could go off any second!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: He won’t set it off until that room is full!
People are still arriving, red carpet shit, that’s at least another half
hour!</p>
<p><strong>dunnigan</strong>: I will not take that risk!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You have to!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: If I’m him, I’ve rigged cameras in that
ballroom – live video feed – first sign of an evacuation, I trigger the
bomb. We have to think ahead of this fuck!</p>
<p><strong>davies</strong>: I’m open.</p>
<p><strong>dunnigan</strong>: Okay, Nick. What’s the move?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I came to talk. Guess who wasn’t in his cell?
Imagine my surprise.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Imagine mine.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Beautiful how you played us. Getting yourself
tossed into solitary – pre-rigged with exits from all five cells.
Whichever one we put you in, you had your bases covered. I thought I was
such a bad-ass putting you down here. Turns out I was doing what you
wanted.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: That’s how you play. Make the other guy think
it’s his idea. You came to talk, so talk.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Been thinking. If I’d done things differently
– made different decisions from the start – we wouldn’t have gotten to
this point.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: But it happened. And here we are.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Here we are. Your decisions put us here too.
This mess is on both of us.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: You want to hold hands? What’s your
point?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: We can’t change decisions we’ve made. We can
only account for decisions we make from here. I know what mine will be.
What about you? You gonna finish dialing that number, or what?</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: If I don’t? What are you offering?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You looking to deal?</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: I’m willing to listen.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Okay, here’s the deal. The deal is…there is no
deal. I told you. No more deals with murderers. I’m sticking to that.
That’s my decision. It’s what you taught me. Strange as it sounds, I’m
grateful for the lesson.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Your turn. You make the right decision, I’ll
see what I can do for you. But the wrong decision is one you’ll have to
live with the rest of your life.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Me too…</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: …because like I said, it’s a decision you’ll
have to live with the rest of your life. Which at this point I figure
is… …another 35 seconds.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Check mate.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: The hatch handle rattles – now padlocked
shut.</p>
<p><strong>fast cut</strong>: Dunnigan thrusts himself out of the
tunnel, cops grabbing his arms, pulling him free…</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Well played.</p>
<p><strong>iger</strong>: Jesus. Thank God that wing was empty.</p>
<p><strong>iger</strong>: How do I explain this to the city?</p>
<p><strong>dunnigan</strong>: I think the Mayor will have your back.</p>
<p><strong>long lens</strong>: Nick sitting…waiting…</p>
