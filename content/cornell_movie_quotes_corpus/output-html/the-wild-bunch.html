<p><strong>a train roars past revealing in the distance five met
riding</strong>: TOWARD CAMERA along the tracks. In CLOSE F.G. is.the
back part of a sign.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: To most of America in 1913, the Age of
Innocence had arrived and the stories of the Indian Wars and the
Gold.RuSh and the Great Gunfighters had become either barroom ballyhoo
or front-porch remiraiscences… .But on both sides of the $io Grande men
still lived as thia7 had in the 1 70’s and 1 80’s – unchanged. men in a
changing land. THEY WEAR THE KHAKI UNIFORMS OF THE UNITED STATES
CnVALJRY.. The horses bear the government brand and the saddles are
regulation. PIKE BISHOP,. wearing lieutenant’s bars, rides slightly
ahead of the others. He rides stiffly; always slightly in pain… Pike is
a not unhandsome, leather-faced man in his early forties. A thoughtful,
self-educated top gun with a penchant for violence who is afraid of
nothing - except the. changes in himself and those around him. Make no
mistake, Pike Bishop is not a hero – his values are not ours – he is a
gunfighter, a criminal, a bank. robber, a killer of men. His sympathies
are not for fences, for trolleys.and telegraphs or better schools. He
lives outside and against society because he believes in that way of
life and if he has moments of sympathy for others, moments of regret, t
hey ’ are short lived. He is not a ‘good man’ according to the
righteous… To them he is totally bad, and he wouldn’t have it any other
way. Next to him DUTCH ENGSTROM wears the uniform of a sergeant. Dutch
is big„ good-natured with a fast gun hand, strong loyalty and, like
Pike, a bone deep distaste for rules and regulations. He can sing,. has
more than his share of charm, but believes in nothing except two men,
and Pike is one. Behind them ride two brothers, LYLE and TECTOR GORCH,
dressed as corporals. Lyle and Tector are big, tough, hot tempered and
sudden. They work together, eat together and</p>
<p><strong>2 continued</strong>: sometimes sleep together with the same
whore. Brutal, vicious in a fight, illiterate,. they are always pressing
for an advantage and once they get it – they never let go. They are
without loyalty or honor, to anyone except each other and that is
limited. A fifth man wears the single stripe of a PFC. This is. AL’GEL.
Angel is a good-looking, bilingual Mexican boy in his middle 20’s who
has seen so much blood and violence and cruelty under Diaz that he
rebelled – but his rebellion was not with Villa or Obregon, his was a
one-man revolution against them all. He believes in his family, his
village and the inherent dignity of. man . ” He is faster than his
companions with a gun – and a better shot – but he can’t. laugh at the
loss of love or suffer the loss of pride – Mexican pride - a pride that
can kill him, but if it does,. he will have no regrets. REACHING THE
SIGN THE MEN STOP. Witut.speaking they, begin to brush off their
clothing and get their uniforms in order.</p>
<p><strong>4 the sign reads in railroad letters: san rafael,
texas</strong>: And underneath, someone has printed:</p>
<p><strong>stay on and grow with our community</strong>: PIKE’ AND ’
DUTCH STARE FOR A MOMENT AT THE SIGN, slightly bemused. _</p>
<p><strong>dutch</strong>: Make you feel welcome?</p>
<p>****: It helps..</p>
<p><strong>tec tor</strong>: What’s it say?</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: It invites us to stay with the community and
grow. It is here, perhaps with time and small miracle – that you could
be taught to read.</p>
<p><strong>5 continued</strong>: Tector looks at Angel for a long
moment, then turns to Pike.</p>
<p><strong>tector</strong>: I never enlisted to serve with no
smart-mouthed kid.</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: Nor I with dogs.</p>
<p><strong>dutch</strong>: ITd like to transfer to another unit – there
seems to be dissension in the ranks.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Itll transfer both of you – just one more
word. They look at him silently. He means it. Finally Tike spurs his
horse and the group sta’ts for town, CAMERA PANNING. THEM PAST. THE
STATt.ON A�M BOXCARS into a side street.</p>
<p><strong>the square. shows the mexican/spanish influence and.is
crowded</strong>: with weekend visitors. Men,. women and children are.
milling about, shopping and idly trading gossip.. The town.has the look
of turn of the century Americana along with its.Spanisn heritage. The
group of soldiers enter almost unnoticed.- Riding downethe street they
pass: A LARGE TENT IN FRONT OF WHICH IS A BANNER ANNOUNCING a W.C.T.U.
meeting, which, according to the SOUNDS of the bass drum and a sermon
denouncing rum, is presently going on inside.</p>
<p><strong>speaker</strong>: Leviticus. 10.9. Do not drink wine or
strong drink thou,nor thy sons with thee least ye die. It shall be a
statute forever. Look. not though. upon. the. wine when it. is red when
it giveth his color in the cup when it moveth itself aright at the last
it biteth like a serpent and stingeth like an adder.</p>
<p>****: That is in the good book.. but here in this town, it is five
cents a glass. Five cents a glass, does anyone think that that is really
the price of a —-drink? The price of a drink let him decide who has lost
his courage and his pride and who lies a govelling heap of clay not far
removed from a beast today.-</p>
<p><strong>congregation</strong>: I hereby solemnly procaise, God
helping me, to abstain from all di stilled, fer- mented and malt
ligi34rs3 including wine, beer and cider, and to employ all proper means
to discourage the Ilse of and. traffic in the same.</p>
<p><strong>as the group rides around the square,. three.
soldiers,</strong>: ABE,. PHIL AND BURT, at the hitching rail on one
side of the street,. turn and keep pace with the group on horseback.</p>
<p><strong>saloon. at t�- end of the street, they dismount across
from</strong>: THE YELLOW AND BROWN RAILROAD ADMINISTRATION BUILDING. As
they swing out of the saddle the other ’ soldiers’ join them. 1l.’ PIKE
AND HIS COMPANIONS REMOVE EMPTY SADDLE BAGS FROM their horses and step
onto the boardwalk or sidewalk that surrounds the’square. Some passersby
look curiously.</p>
<p>****: Fall in – and follow me. The men,. with the ’exception of
Tector, Phil and Abe, shuffle into a ragged column of twos.</p>
<p><strong>buck</strong>: Real quiet, ‘sir.’ Pike looks at the horses,
then at:</p>
<p><strong>13, the sign over the entrance of a building across the
street</strong>: It reads: PECOS AND SOUTH TEXAS R.R. 14. PIKE PAUSES.
FOR A MINUTE and behind him the men surreptitious- ly touch their
holstered forty-five automatics. Pike leaves the boardwalk, crossing
toward. the railroad office. Tector and Phil stay with the horses.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Beg pardon, Ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>dutch</strong>: Let. me, Ma’am. Dutch picks up the package,
Pike offers the lady his arm. She hesitates, accepts. Pike and Dutch,
followed by the others, lead her across the ’street.</p>
<p><strong>ten. men stretched out behind the false front t_dly
watching</strong>: THE CROWD BELOW, THEIR RIFLES AT THEIR SIDES Behind
them. on the flat of the roof are open bedrolls, and the remains of at
least three meals. It is hot., they have been there a -long time, and
they are tired.</p>
<p><strong>road executive sitting in the middle of the men – all
ragged</strong>: HARDCASES – frowns a little as he watches the soldiers
in the street below. It is. hotter than hell on the tin roof and he is
sweating heavily. He turns, edges forward, then nudges: 18, DEKE
THORNTON SITTING NEXT TO HIM, his back against the wall, Thornton is a
hard-bodied, quiet-spoken man, with a lined face and the embittered
manner of someone who has changed sides to stay alive and while part of
his life has gone out of him with the change, the personal integrity by
which he has lived is still. intact.</p>
<p>****: The soldiers sit up – take a look! Thornton straightens, turns
slowly, looks – stiffens a little.</p>
<p><strong>harrigan</strong>: Pike?</p>
<p><strong>thorn ton</strong>: He’s there. The bounty hunters react and
prepare to fire. Over this shot is the sound of Pike calling to Thornton
– from the past. 19 PIKE REACHES THE DOOR AND WITHOUT PAUSING, murmurs
‘goodbye’ to the lady and enters, followed by the others, 20 ON THE
ROOF, HARRIGAN WHIRLS ON HIS MEN as they begin aim- •ing, ready to
fire..</p>
<p>****: Hold your fire; – We wait till they come out – catch them in
the act. Then.you kill him or go back to Yuma; Thornton turns toward
him, his.face white, remembering-</p>
<p><strong>jail doors clanging shut</strong>: 20A THORNTON, WRISTS
LASHED TO THE BARS OF THE CELL’S window, is being whipped by a guard.
20B THORNTON on the rock pile is making little ones of big ones.</p>
<p><strong>21 t.c. &amp; coffer, two of the men, point toward tector.and
phil</strong>: .standing by the horses.</p>
<p>****: I can nail himl</p>
<p>****: He said wait.</p>
<p>****: What if they go.out back?</p>
<p>****: It’s covered, you two-bit rednecked peckerwood. The men settle
slightly. Thornton remains tense – then turns as:</p>
<p><strong>harr igan</strong>: That’s all we needed:</p>
<p><strong>paymaster</strong>: What -you meant to do does not interest
me What you did – Then, seeing: 24 PIES AND THE OTHERS waiting, he steps
to the ody window, smiling with the thought that their visit means.
military business for the railroad. His mood. changes as the men draw
theirand Pike steps towards him.</p>
<p><strong>paymaster</strong>: What is it?…What do you want? 25 DUTCH.,
LYLE AND THE. OTHER MEN SWIFTLY MOVE behind the counter. Pike ignores
the paymaster and turns to: 26 CRAZY LEE STRINGFELLOW,. a young,
compulsive killer with just enough sense to. pour piss out of a boot
were printed on the heel:</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: If they move, kill them. C.L. grins happily
and squats on the floor, his 12 gauge pump shotgun angled up at:</p>
<p><strong>27 the terrified paymaster, his two assistants and margaret,
a</strong>: HATCHET-FACED HARRIDAN IN HER FIFTIES i,iho enters the
office carrying. a.wrapped package and is instantly shoved into. a
corner with the other prisoners. 28 ON THE STREET – THE W.C.T.U. BASS
DRUM BOOMS CLOSER as the parade picks up kids and other scoffing
supporters as it moves around the square. . People and their children
are crowding through the trees to the boardwalk to watch the band. and
group of believers following the_,. in a formation that is almost as
rigid as. their song and their faces.</p>
<p><strong>earrigan</strong>: Damn them! The parade moves toward the
saloon.</p>
<p><strong>tho rnto n</strong>: They should have been told:</p>
<p><strong>harri gan</strong>: Told-what!? Sus t how. long do you think
anyone in this manure pile can keep his mouth shut? Before Thornton can
answer: 30 T..C.. SHIFTS TO CHANGE POSITION and his hand. touches the
tin roof, ,causing him to.yelp with pain.. The others snap a look in
his. direction, then freeze as: 31 ’VECTOR ON THE BOARDWALK. LOOKS UP,.
SEES NOTHING, leans back against a rail watching the horses and the hymn
singers. After a moment, he smiles a little, beating time,. as he
remembers some forgotten march he watched from his daddy’s
shoulders.</p>
<p><strong>32 in the pay office – angel crosses to the window as the
noise</strong>: FROM THE PARADE GROWS LOUDER. He looks out Behind hi::
3.3 PIKE AND THE OTHERS ARE LOADING SACKS OF SILVER into their saddle
bags. They are almost ready to. leave. The paymaster, his assistants and
the customer, their hands still up, watch C.L.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Trash – Filthy trash!</p>
<p><strong>c.l.</strong>: You just. hush now –</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: People marching and singing coming down the
street – going to pass near the horses.</p>
<p>****: Well, we’ll just join in. Angel, turning away, hesitates,
looking up through the window</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: Rifles – one – no three,. maybe more, on the
roof.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Waiting for us</p>
<p>****: Son of a bitch He turns and crosses quickly to the back door.
Dutch follows. Pike opens it a little, looks ou.t at.</p>
<p><strong>tin cans and among them the indistinct. figures of rifles
and</strong>: HATS – they are surrounded. - 37 IN THE OFFICE – DUTCH
JOINS PIKE AT THE DOOR and looks out, then curses softly.</p>
<p><strong>dutch</strong>: How in hell could they have known we were
coming?</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: How in hell do I know?</p>
<p><strong>dutch</strong>: Where do we go?</p>
<p><strong>-pike</strong>: Out front – that’s where the horses are.. He
shuts the door, crosses toward the paymaster.</p>
<p><strong>c.l.</strong>: We go ing..out back, Mr. Bishop?</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: No, son – we got company there too – -Besides,
when I travel, I like my feet to dangle.</p>
<p><strong>c.l.</strong>: I kill ’em-now?</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: No. You just hold them here and wait as long
as you can – after the shooting starts.</p>
<p><strong>c.l.</strong>: 111-1 hold ’am till hell freezes over or you
say different ! Pike, pushing the frightened paymaster in front of him,
hesitates., looks. at C.L., then continues to . the door, grabs the
handle, looks back again.</p>
<p><strong>38 c.l.”is crouched in front of the two assistants and

<p><strong>c.l..</strong>: Well, how’d you like to kiss my sister’s
black cat’s ass. Harrigan fires. C.L. slumps, goes down on the other
knee. More bounty hunters burst into the room.</p>
<p><strong>83 c.l. laughs, falls flats rolls and begins to pump the
shotgun</strong>: and everybody dives for cover and opens fire, riddling
him with bullets. 84 BUT HE TAKES THE MARSHAL, the deputy and one bounty
hunter with him before he is cut to pieces. 85 HARRIGAN AND THORNTON
LOOKING DOWN at the shambles in the room, turn as:</p>
<p><strong>86 wainscoat, the mayor, enter, followed by a group of
shocked</strong>: AND IRATE TOWNSPEOPLE. BENSON, a beefy redneck
rancher, curses bitterly as he crosses to Harrigan.</p>
<p><strong>benson</strong>: We’re holding you – your whole damned rail-
road responsible for this carnage –</p>
<p><strong>harrigan</strong>: Mr. Benson…o</p>
<p><strong>wainscoat</strong>: Innocent people are dead …women mangled –
dying –because you used our town as a battlefield; You’re going to pay,
sir – your-railroad is going to pay for our blood;</p>
<p><strong>harrigan</strong>: Without the railroad this place would
still be a lousy little pueblo, so don’t make any threats to me;</p>
<p><strong>benson</strong>: You can’t ambush innocent people. on our
street!</p>
<p>****: We were preventing a robbery and.attempt- ing to capture a band
of outlaws…</p>
<p>****: You lured that gang in here… the rail- roadts been blabbing
about a big silver payload for weeks;</p>
<p><strong>harrigan</strong>: We represent the law!</p>
<p><strong>benson</strong>: If it takes vigilantes – if it takes federal
troops – I’ll stop you and —-your hired killers..</p>
<p><strong>harrigan</strong>: I can. assure you that there won’t be any
more trouble… . My men will follow –</p>
<p><strong>benson</strong>: Your men enter this town again and they will
be shot on sight; Thornton ignores them, slowly rolling a cigarette,
looking after Pike. Harrigan exits, crosses to Thornton.</p>
<p><strong>harrigan</strong>: I pulled. you out of jail to get- that
bunch – and you failed –</p>
<p>****: You gave the ordersl If you want the job done right – you keep
the hell out of it next time - You and the rest of your railroad trash”
I’ll do it – but my way. - -</p>
<p><strong>harrigan</strong>: What.makes you think there’ll be a next
time for you? What makes you think you’re not going back behind bars for
twenty more years? Thornton’s face twists as he hears again the clanging
of cell doors and the whimpering of prisoners..</p>
<p><strong>thornton</strong>: Because I’m all you’ve got Because I know
him. Because you know I’ll get him – I’ll kill him rather than
go-back.</p>
<p><strong>harri gan</strong>: Twice .he’ s made a fool of me - He never
will again. You know why you’re here –</p>
<p>****: Not because you’re good – because I want him dead – at your
hands – the hands of his old friend, his partner –</p>
<p><strong>tho rnton</strong>: IT 11 get him – you have my word.</p>
<p><strong>89 the wild bunch rides down a steep trail into a dry
arroyo</strong>: They are weary, but determined. Buck, last in line,
covered with blood, is swaying in the saddle. Although severely wounded,
he still clutches the bags of silver. 90 REACHING THE BOTTOM OF THE
ARROYO THE MEN SPUR their horses across the d r y stream bed and up the
steep bank on. t he other side.</p>
<p><strong>91 dutch and pike are in the lead. behind them the others
lunge</strong>: UP IN SINGLE FILE. Angel, second to last, reaches the
top, turns as:</p>
<p><strong>his horse, hits the ground and somersaults backwards to
the</strong>: BOTTOM, still clutching the saddle bags. 93 ANGEL PULLS UP
and calls to Pike.</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: Fijate. 94 BUCK, ON HIS HANDS AND KNEES,
MOANS WITH PAIN as he attempts to crawl up the slope. 95 PIKE RIDES DOWN
TO HIM,. SWINGS OFF EIS HORSE and stands looking down.</p>
<p><strong>97 pike gently takes the bags of silver. out of buck’s
hand.</strong>: Buck lurches forward, grabbing at Pike who steps back,
Pike crosses to his horse, and painfully climbs into the saddle.</p>
<p><strong>buck</strong>: I kin still -ride…I can’t see, but I kin ride…
- No, I can’t – Finish it, Mr. Bishop.</p>
<p><strong>99 buck, on his knees, • is caught square by the. sho t and
hurled</strong>: OVER BACKWARDS. He slides several feet over the smooth,
round pebbles of the wash, then is still. Pike turns his horse and spurs
it . up the slope. 100 THE MEN WATCH SILENTLY AS PIKE RIDES UP. and
halts. They don’t move, all looking down-at-Buck.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: You boys want to move on – or stay here and
give him a ‘decent burial’.?</p>
<p><strong>tector</strong>: Well,. he was a good man –</p>
<p>****: He’s dead!</p>
<p>****: And he’s got a ’lot of ’good men? back there to keep him
company.</p>
<p><strong>lyle</strong>: Too damn many.</p>
<p>****: I’d like. to say a. few kind words for all the departed – then
perhaps a hymn or two would be in order – followed by a’ church supper
with a choir. CONTINTED</p>
<p><strong>lyle</strong>: Crazy bastards – both of you l Tector follows
his brother, cursing.. 101 PIKE AND DUTCH LOOK AT EACH OTHER silently –
try to grin – finally make it – then follow. The bunch is attentive, but
now certain that they are not being closely followed, they can relax a
little.. Pike and Dutch are side by side.</p>
<p>****: ,Ten years ago it was some shaky drunk with a tin badge that
hid in the g1n mill till you cleared town with your grab…Now,
they’re</p>
<p><strong>i</strong>: c waitin’. for you –</p>
<p><strong>: dutch</strong>: With old friends. ’</p>
<p><strong>lyle</strong>: Old friends?</p>
<p><strong>dutch</strong>: Deke Thornton.</p>
<p><strong>lyle</strong>: I thought he was your partner?</p>
<p>****: He was – but he got old and tired and when that happens, things
change.</p>
<p><strong>dutch</strong>: ‘He changed – you didn’t.’</p>
<p>****: Come on pardner, let’s get out of here. -</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: - You.sound like you’re all caught up,</p>
<p><strong>thornton</strong>: Caught up enough to know we’ve overstayed
our welcomes</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: What in hell is the matter with you?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Stay – please,</p>
<p>****: We’ve got money.to spend and not a worry in the worlds</p>
<p>****: They’re not going to look for us in their own backyard,</p>
<p><strong>thornton</strong>: How can you be. so damned sure? He shakes
off the girl, crosses to a sideboard, pours a drink..</p>
<p>****: That’s my business – being sure. There is a knock at the door
and. Thornton whirls. Elizabeth throws the bolt.</p>
<p>****: Hold it!</p>
<p>****: Relax – just a little champagne I ordered.</p>
<p><strong>101-d elizabeth. sticks. out her tongue at thornton and opens
the.</strong>: DOOR and gunfire fills the room as:</p>
<p><strong>101-e a deputy sheriff steps into the doorway-and shoots
thornton</strong>: high on the shoulder. Thornton. is knocked sprawling…
The Deputy moves into the room and fires at Pike but misses, as. 101-F
PIKE SLIPS PAST the screaming women into an adjoining room. The other
men pursue.P.ike as the Deputy bends down and snaps Thornton’s wrists
together with handcuffs. The sound: of gunfire is heard from the street
outside, then two of the men re-enter the room. The Deputy looks
up..</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: Get him? The man shakes his head. 101-G
THORNTON, HIS FACE TWISTED WITH PAIN AND BITTERNESS, makes no attempt
•to struggle as he .is pulled to his feet and moved out the door.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: He’s had five years on the r ck pile, Dutch –
and twenty more to u go – that.can hurt a man.</p>
<p><strong>lyle</strong>: Say – I’ve heard it’s like the.old times in
Argentina…3utch Cassidy down. there making a killing…</p>
<p><strong>pike.</strong>: Bolivia…but it’ll be over there too, pretty
soon. Those :pining companies will bring down a bunch .of hardcases and
Butchtll get his..</p>
<p>****: ..Every one of us is worth a year of drinking and whoring to
any fool that can read a wanted poster and carry a gun.</p>
<p>****: Deke Thornton isn’t just. any fool that can carry a gun and
read-a wanted poster.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Fo – but he takes a dim view of 20 more years
in the Carcel –</p>
<p>****: We can hope he ain’t on. our tail – but don’t bet on it..</p>
<p>****: Tector and I have been stealing since the big depression and we
ain’t never been caught. This Thornton don’t bother us nohe..</p>
<p>****: I don’t really give a damn about Deke Thornton…I just know that
I’d surely like to aet the hell off. this horse.</p>
<p><strong>thornton</strong>: Tell me, Mr. Harrigan.– how does it feel?
Getting paid for it? -Getting paid to sit back and hire your killings
with the law’s arms around you? How does it feel to be so damned
right;?</p>
<p><strong>harr igan</strong>: Good, Mr..Thornton…it feels good.</p>
<p>****: You dirty son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>harrigan</strong>: You have 30 days to get him – or 30 days
to Yuma. You’re my Judas Goat, Mr. Thornton. Use them – lead them – get
Pike – then kill them off. When you come back,</p>
<p><strong>i</strong>: want all of them head down over a saddle.</p>
<p>****: All of them -•- head down over a- saddle. 30 days. Heturns and
walks away whistling.</p>
<p>****: Mexico lindo.</p>
<p><strong>lyle</strong>: What’s so ’lindo° about it.</p>
<p><strong>at a small desk in front of the other bounty
hunters,</strong>: The interior of the room is tawdry, disorderly and
smells bad. The bare walls are decorated with pin-ups from the Police
Gazette. The men sit attentively on the bunks. and.foot lockers.,
Harrigan is marking beside their names in a large ledger book. After
making a ’notation, he looks up..</p>
<p><strong>harrigan</strong>: The hard money value of the men killed
less my commi.sson amounts to. one hundred and fifty dollars. 104 THE
MEN MUMBLE AND SHIFT. Harrigan holds up four wanted posters. The bounty
hunters move closer for a better look.</p>
<p><strong>harrigan</strong>: Bishop… .Engstrom… .Lyle and Tector
Gorch…are worth a total of four thousand five hundred dollars – and you
let them all ride outs Any one’of these pelts would not only clear you
with the company,.but would mean a bundle of cash to raise hell with.
Harrigan stands, crosses to the door.</p>
<p><strong>t.c.</strong>: How ’.bout a little liquor money for tonight,
Mr. Harrigan?</p>
<p><strong>harrigan</strong>: There won’t be any tonight – you move
after them in ten minutes – Get them – get Pike and youtre rich. . But
if one of you quits on me I’ll pay a thousand dollar bonus to the man
who kills him. 105 THE MEN SILENTLY BEGIN TO PACK THEIR BELONGINGS.
Harrigan motions to Thornton, then exits.</p>
<p><strong>harrigan</strong>: Why should I let you go with them?</p>
<p>****: We’ve’been over that before, Mr. Harrigan.</p>
<p><strong>harrigan</strong>: You could just ride off – even join him
again – you’d like that, wouldn’t .you?</p>
<p><strong>thornton</strong>: What I like and what I. need are two
different things.</p>
<p>****: ’Listen – I don’t want to go back to prison, Mr. Harrigan,…
.not ever – but it.has to be my way…</p>
<p><strong>harr igan</strong>: All right..</p>
<p><strong>thornton</strong>: I need good men: You saw what happened
today.</p>
<p>****: You’ll use what you have.</p>
<p>****: And you’ll see it doesn’t happen again or I’ll see you dead or
rotting for -the rest of – you try your life behind bars to run – I’ll
be after you and so will. they.</p>
<p>****: I gave you my word.</p>
<p><strong>harrigan</strong>: We’ll -see what it’s worth – five
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>tector</strong>: Just more of Texas as far as I’m
concerned.</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: You have no eyes. And he rises ahead with
Pike and’Dutch across the tracks into Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>109 it is a mass of dried blood which thornton wipes away
with</strong>: HIS GLOVED HAND, then looks up at the eight bounty
hunters who are sitting on their horses watching him.</p>
<p><strong>thornton</strong>: V All rightt… .How many of you killed this
one?</p>
<p><strong>coffer</strong>: I knowed I wounded’ three – but I wasn’t
sure about –</p>
<p>****: Jabali:… 111 JABALI, AN AGING NAVAHO INDIAN trots up
to.him’.</p>
<p><strong>thornton</strong>: This pelt should clear you up – take him
back to town…and tell Harrigan to get me a list of every Army garrison
and payroll schedule on the border. We got another half hour of light
and they might be just up ahead counting their money.</p>
<p><strong>112 pike and his men ride into the ruins of a small
ranchero.</strong>: A young boy takes their horses while an old.man and
his wounded son watch. Behind them, an ancient woman pays no attention
as she slaps tortillas into shape. Two small children watch, big-eyed.
;113 THE MEN ARE QUIET WITH FATIGUE AS THEY DISMOUNT AND TIE. j THEIR
HORSES.. FREDDY SYKES, a skinny old man in tattered range clothes,
crosses to Pike as he unloads his saddle bags.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Them others ain’t comin’?</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: None of ’em? 111 PIKE TAKES THE BAGS OUT OF
THE CORRAL TO THE FIRE that burns near an adobe wall and drops them on a
poncho, watches as the others do the same.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: But I got horses and gear for all them
fellers like you said –</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: They won’t need them – we will. Sykes thinks
this over, finally nods. a little and turns away. 115 LYLE AND HIS
BROTHER AND DUTCH STAND in a half. circle around the poncho. waiting.
Angel, the last, drops his saddle bag, then crosses to the wall and
drops down to rest. For a long moment the men look down.a-t the pile of
saddle bags.</p>
<p><strong>lyle</strong>: About the sharing up…</p>
<p>****: The sharing up’s going to be the some as always.</p>
<p>****: Tector and I don? t like the idea of him getting the same as
us…He’s just starting out and this is our stake for new territory. Pike
looks at him silently. He has heard this kind of argument many times in
the past and it is obvious he is sick to death of it. Lyle finally looks
awa- at his brother;</p>
<p><strong>tector</strong>: And I figure a ’share to that old man for
watching the horses is a share too much. ll&amp; PIKE TAKES A KNIFE OUT
OF HIS BELT, opens a saddle bag,. takes out a sack of silver, kneels to
slit the bag open.</p>
<p><strong>lyle</strong>: You hear me, Pike? – I said it ain’t fair…
Pike stands,. flips the knife into the ground, faces the brothers.</p>
<p>****: If you two boys don’t like equal shares why in hell don’t you
just take it all? They look at him silently.</p>
<p><strong>117 dutch drifts away a little to tie side of pike.
•sykes</strong>: MOVES OUT OF THE BACKGROUND, a buffalo gun now dangling
from one arm. The brothers tense. Angel laughs softly.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Well,..why don’t you answer me, you dapnned
yellow.-livered trash? The brothers fide, et., look at each other.</p>
<p><strong>lyle</strong>: Ah.–’ Pike, you know…</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: I don’t know a damned thing except I either
lead this bunch or I end it – right now;</p>
<p><strong>lyle</strong>: No, sir – we divide just as you say. Pike
looks at them a moment, then picks up his knife and alicea open a bag
and -turns it upside down and dumps the contents onto the spread-out
poncho watching as:</p>
<p><strong>118 steel washers pour 01 0 the poncho</strong>: 119 THE
GROUP IS SILENT IN DISBEL’EF staring at the pile of worthless steel.
Hykes eases up, takes a cautious look.</p>
<p><strong>tector</strong>: Rings:, Steel rings!</p>
<p><strong>dutch.</strong>: . Washers!</p>
<p><strong>120 pike turns away. lyle takes another bag and cuts into
it.</strong>: More-washers pour out. _</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Son of a bitch! 121 LYLE’S BOOT FLASHES INTO
THE PILE. The washers fly in all directions. Lyle whirls on Pike.</p>
<p><strong>lyle</strong>: Washers…we shot our way out of that town for a
dollar’s worth of steel holes. He kicks into the pile and scatters
Washers across the clearing.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: They set it up:</p>
<p><strong>lyle</strong>: . Who the hell is ’they!!?</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: ‘They?’: by ‘they, are just plain and fancy
’they.’ ‘They.’ high laughter splitting Caught you, didn’t they? Tied a
tin can to your tail – didn’t they? Lead you in and waltzed you out – Oh
my what a bunch – big tough ones – standing around with a handful of
holes – a thumb up your ass and a big grin to pass the time of day with.
122 TECTORSWINGS AT HIM, BUT THE OLD MAN DUCKS, then falls and
rollsaway, still laughing. Tector starts’to follow, Pike stepsbetween
them.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Railroad men – Pinkertons – bounty</p>
<p>****: .Deke Thornton.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Deke Thornton? – He was with. them?</p>
<p>****: How come you didn’t know?</p>
<p><strong>123 pike turns away. dutch looks at pike questioningly,
then</strong>: ALL TURN as the SOUND of laughter comes from behind.</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: . Hey, gringo; You take my share.</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: Don’t kill me, gringo …por favor… Take my
share of the ‘silver’ – but</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: ,k for it I Tector-, looking at Angel’s gun,
half turns to Pike.</p>
<p><strong>pike:</strong>: Go on, fall apart! Lyle and Tector hesitate,
their hands on their guns – Dutch moves back into the shadows of the
firelight, his rifle drifting across Tector. 127 ANGEL SMILES AND SLOWLY
replaces his gun.</p>
<p><strong> dutch</strong>: Let’s walk soft, boys…</p>
<p><strong>128 lyle, still more than half ready to go for his
gun,</strong>: hesitates. 129 TECTOR LOOKS AT PIKE, DUTCH, ANGEL, T.HEN
slaps his gun into his holster – and moves away, but his hand is never
far from the weapon..</p>
<p><strong>130 the group stands motionless for a moment, then sykes
reaches</strong>: INTO HIS COAT, LIFTS OUT A BOTTLE,. SITS BY THE FIRE
and hands’it to Dutch. Dutch sits by Sykes, takes a drink, offers the
bottle to Tector, Tector hesitates, then hunkers down and drinks. Slowly
the others.follow suit.</p>
<p><strong>dutch</strong>: What’s our next move?</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Agua Verde is the closest three days maybe –
then we sell the extra stock – get some griib and the news and drift
back to the border – maybe a payroll – maybe abank –</p>
<p>****: Maybe that damned railroad:</p>
<p><strong>tec tor</strong>: That railroad sire bsi hell ain’t getting
4ny easier. •</p>
<p>****: And we,ain’t getting any younger. For a moment, it looks like
he’ll get a smart answer in return, then: Lyle drinks and lifts the
bottle to Angel who.crosses to.the fire,. drinks and passes it to
Sykes.</p>
<p>****: .We got to start thinking beyond our guns – theft days are
closin’ fast.</p>
<p><strong>lyle</strong>: All your fancy planning and talk damn near got
us shot to pieces for.some lousy bags of washers… Now this was goin.’ to
be our last job before we head south …We spent all our time and money
getting ready for this.</p>
<p>****: You spent your time and money running whores in Hondo while I
spent my stake setting it up. LYLE CALMLY PICKS UP A WASHER, flips. it
to Pike who catches it, looks at it, through it, drinks, tosses it back
on the pile.</p>
<p>****: Looks like I’d have been better off running whores than making
plans9 stealing horses and buying uniforms. 1.32 THE MEN ARE SILENT FOR
A LONG MOMENT. Then they break into soft laughter which builds
slowly.</p>
<p><strong>lyle</strong>: He –.he was making plans while me and Tector
was – He breaks up and can’t continue.</p>
<p><strong>dutch</strong>: ,-While you was getting your bell rope pulled
by – By two – mind you, two – Hondo whores – while Pike’s dreaming of
washers - you’re matching two of them – in tandem And the wild bunch
falls apart in laughter – even Pike is caught, but as he laughs, he
knows that they are together again.</p>
<p><strong>t.c.</strong>: How close you figure we are?</p>
<p><strong>thornton</strong>: Not close enough… They’re across the
border by now. -</p>
<p><strong>coffer</strong>: Deke - you rode with. Pike – what kind of a
man are we up against?</p>
<p><strong>thornton</strong>: The best –</p>
<p><strong>133 continued</strong>: THORNTON He’s never got caught. - And
he won’t be if you boys don’t learn your trade. -</p>
<p><strong>fess</strong>: How was it – then mm You know – in the old
days? I only come out here last spring.</p>
<p><strong>thornton</strong>: You can saddle up or shut up – take your
choice –</p>
<p><strong>coffer</strong>: “What will he do?</p>
<p><strong>thornton</strong>: That’s what I have to figure.</p>
<p><strong>coffer</strong>: Maybe they’ll split up.</p>
<p><strong>thornton</strong>: No – not ’that. bunch. They’ll try again.
- -</p>
<p><strong>t.c.</strong>: How do you know?’ But Thornton doesn’t
answer.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Didn’t you run some kind of mine – in
Sonora?</p>
<p><strong>dutch</strong>: Yeah, I helped run a little copper – nothing
for us there except day wages, if it was running now – which it
ain’t.</p>
<p><strong>3l..</strong>: 135 PIKE FINDS IT.IMPOSSIBLE TO get
comfortable. Groaning and wincing with pain he shifts on the
bedroll.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Why in the hell, did you ever quit it?</p>
<p><strong>dutch</strong>: Why in hell are you still goin’?</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: I don.’t know”any better – maybe don’t want
any better, Hell, I wouldn’t know what to do with ‘better’ if it poked
me.in the eye with a sharp stick.</p>
<p><strong>dutch</strong>: You -never gave it :a chance9 Pike.</p>
<p>****: I threw away more chances in one year that you will see in your
whole.l.ife – but that don’t mean you have. to ’ be a damn fool like me.
Dutch sits up, rolls and lights a cigarette.</p>
<p><strong>dutch</strong>: You got a halfway hard mouth, partner.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: What in hell do you want me to-say ,-?</p>
<p><strong>dutch</strong>: Just don’t give me, no lectures.. They are
silent – finally:</p>
<p><strong>pike:</strong>: This was going to be my last, too… I’m not
getting around any better – like the red-haired lady said to the.
white-haired judge – ‘I only got so many miles left -in my backside,
Your Honor, and I aim to keep it moving while I’m still young enough to
feel. what it’s there for.’ I’d like to make a good score -. then back
off. CONTINUED</p>
<p><strong>dutch</strong>: Back off to what? Any real ideas for a next
one? Pike closes his eyes and leans back.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Pershing. has. got men spread over the whole
border. Everyone of those garrisons is going to be.gptting payroll.</p>
<p><strong>dutch</strong>: That kind of information is kind of. rough to
come by.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Well – I don’t figure it’s going to .be easy,
but it can be done.</p>
<p><strong>dutch.</strong>: They’ll be waiting for us.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: I wouldn’,t have it any other way.</p>
<p><strong>coffer:</strong>: If he’s in old Mex – do we follow him?</p>
<p><strong>- thornton</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>coffer</strong>: Why not ?..</p>
<p><strong>thornton</strong>: He’ll be back.</p>
<p><strong>coffer</strong>: Harrigan ’ said something about thirty days
–</p>
<p><strong>thornton</strong>: That’s what he said,</p>
<p><strong>dutch</strong>: You must have hurt that railroad pretty bad –
they spent a lot of time and money getting that ambush set up for
us.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Well, I caught up to them – two or three times
– There was a man named Harrigan – He had a certain way of doing things
– So I made him change his ways – when you do that to a narrow man – he
can’t live with it - from then on he’s got to change you – break you –
just to prove he’s.right – there-’s a hell of a lot of people, Dutch –
that just can’t stand to be wrong.</p>
<p><strong>dutch</strong>: Pride, I guess</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: I guess – but they can’t ever forget it – that
pride that being wrong or learn by it.</p>
<p><strong>dutch</strong>: And you – and me –did we learn – being wrong
today?</p>
<p>****: Well, I surely hope to God we did. 138 SYKES CROSSES TO PIKE,
GIVES HIM a cup of coffee, moves away,</p>
<p><strong>dutch</strong>: Where’d you find him?</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: . That toothless old wreck was a real gun
about twenty years back – used to run with Thornton and me killed his
share and more – around —-Langery – Ambushed stages all along that old
board highway.,.He had those Swede immigrants so scared theyQd starve
rather than go to town and by beans for their kids, and there wasn’t a
sheriff in. the territory to take issue – He laughs, drinks the coffee
and gags..</p>
<p>****: And he ain’t changed – only now-he does his killing with a
coffee cup. Dutch laughs and then both lean back listeningas: 139.
ANGEL, WRAPPED IN HIS SERAPE LEANING AGAINST THE-WALL, plays the great
ranchero songs of old Mexico., 140 LYLE.AND TECTOR ARE ALSO AWAKE and
listening.</p>
<p><strong>dutch</strong>: - Pike, I wouldn?t have it no other -way
aither.</p>
<p><strong>141 pike and the others ride along</strong>: THE’TOP-OF A
HIGH DUNE;. They are tired and dirty. Near the edge they dismount to
lead their horses to the bottom. - 1L.2 THE SAND IS LOOSE AND THE
FOOTING EXTREMELY DIFFICULT as they start down in single file, Sykes is
last, he leads his own horse, a pack animal, and three of the
empties.</p>
<p><strong>forward:</strong>: PULLING THE FIVE HORSES DOWN WITH HIM..
Unable to control his slide he collides with/Tector who is next in line.
Tector’s fall starts a p fain reaction in which all the men slide to the
bottom of ttLe hill. 145 PICKING UP SPEED THEY TUMBLE TO THE BOTTOM and
land in a giant cloud of. dust. There. is a: profusion of coughing and
swearing as the men and-animals struggle to their feet.. 146 TECTOR
STANDS,. CURSES AT SYKES,. then picks up a. stone and throws it at.the
old man who is hit and falls backward.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Leave him alone!</p>
<p>****: Hats goin’ to get pis killed – get rid of him!</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: We don.’t get rid of nobody we stick together
– just like it used to be – when you side aman you stay with him – If
you can’t do that you’re worse than some animal – you’re finished –
we’re finished – all of us! Tector looks at him silently. 148 PIKE TURNS
TO MOUNT THE HORSE. Placing his foot in the stirrup he stiffly starts to
swing on. The leather breaks and. he falls under the animal. Landing on
his back, he lets out a loud shriek.</p>
<p>****: ‘Pears ’Brother Pike’ needs help, Brother Lyle.</p>
<p><strong>lyle</strong>: Riding with ‘Brother Pike’ and old .man Sykes
makes a man wonder if it ain’t time to pick up his chips and-find
another game.</p>
<p><strong>tector</strong>: How in hell are you going to side any- body
if you can’t get on a horse. 152 PIKE LOOKS AT THEM, THEN STEPS onto the
makeshift stirrup and mounts, concealing his pain, taking a few seconds
to gather up the reins and position himself. In the b.g., Dutch swings
onto his horse.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Were about two hours from the Santa Caterinas.
He turns and rides toward the mountains, the men following.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: That was a mighty fine talk you gave the boys
‘bout stickin’ to- gether.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: That Gorch was near killin’ me or me him
–</p>
<p>****: Damned old fool like me’s not worth. takin’ along.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: We started together – we’ll end it
together.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: By God, that’s the way I see it – that’s the
way it’s always been with me…Sorry ‘bout Deke - never figured him that
way, Back in. San. Rafael – my boy how’ d. he do? They ride for a while
in silence as: Pike. thinks this over, finally:. _</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Your boy2</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: C.L. – Clarence Lee – my daughter’s boy —not
too bright, but a good boy – He handle higself all right? – I told him –
you do – just what Mister Bishop says – Did he conduct hisself well?</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: He did fine –</p>
<p>****: Why didn’t you tell me he was your grandson?</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Well, you had enough on your mind He had to
pull his weight just like the rest of us – just wanted to know he didn’t
let you down – run. when things got hot –</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: No —he did fine…just fine.</p>
<p><strong>coffer</strong>: That culvert – good place for them —-to make
an ambush.</p>
<p><strong>thornton</strong>: Go on - ride up and find out. Coffer
hesitates, his -ayes wide with fear. Thornton draws his gun, pulls back
the hammer.</p>
<p>****: Go onl Coffer rides forward.</p>
<p><strong>thornton</strong>: Next time I want advice from any of you
scum I’ll ask for it – until then, keep . your mouths shut and do what
y-ou’ re to ld%</p>
<p><strong>coffer</strong>: All clear”’–</p>
<p><strong>155 thornton rides up to the culverts halts, dismoun-ts,

<p><strong>coffer</strong>: From here on, its Mexico, Mr, Thornton.</p>
<p><strong>t.c.</strong>: Do we follow?</p>
<p><strong>thornton</strong>: What’s the closest town of any size2</p>
<p>****: Agua Verde – maybe two or three days. Juarez – five – six days
hard riding,</p>
<p><strong>thornton</strong>: What’s in Agua Verde?</p>
<p><strong>coffer</strong>: Mexicans – what else. Headquarters for
Huerta regulars. fighting Obregon, led by an old time bandit named
Mapache. Thornton thinks about this, then mounts and rides back in the
direction they have come from.</p>
<p><strong>coffer</strong>: Don’t-we follow?</p>
<p><strong>thornton</strong>: No – we wait.</p>
<p>****: How long –• Mr. Thornton.</p>
<p><strong>thornton</strong>: ’Twenty-eight days.</p>
<p><strong>dutch</strong>: We’re not going to find much down here., That
damned Huerta’ s scraped it clean.</p>

<p><strong>pike</strong>: So –?</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: I wish to visit my f amily…I can do it and
meet you in Agua Verde a day of ter you get there.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: Going this way, you will. have to turn east
when you get south of the range… I-know the way to cross the
mountains.</p>
<p><strong>dutch</strong>: If you know a shorter way..’: show us. Angel
looks away and is silent for several seconds.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Ashamed of having us meet your people?</p>
<p>****: Yes.;..They don’ t know about zny life when I am out of the
village. Pike and Dutch both laugh softly, then Pike pulls up at a .
watering trough and dismounts as his horse begins to drink.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Far as Ifm concerned, you can go,</p>
<p>****: Far as I’m concerned – he goes he dontt come back.</p>
<p><strong>dutch</strong>: That sounds right to me..</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Looks like I’m outvoted.</p>
<p>****: Whatfs the problem?</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Wants to visit his folks alone – thinks we’re
a little rank for his people.</p>
<p><strong>lyle</strong>: I think he can go straight to hell.</p>
<p><strong>tector</strong>: Probably wants to get a bunch of his _people
and waylay us!</p>
<p><strong>dutch</strong>: And take what? Tector thinks this over,
doesn’t answer.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: How do’ you want it?</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: I invite you to my village – my home. Any
violence – any disrespect – and I will. kill you. Tector and Lyle look
at him without expression for a moment, then:.</p>
<p><strong>lyle</strong>: You got a sister?</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: …Yes.</p>
<p><strong>lyle</strong>: I would be proud to.make her acquaint- ance –
and. that of your Mama, too.</p>
<p><strong>tector</strong>: And your Grandmaw too, sonny… Angel looks at
them, then mounts, rides toward the mountains</p>
<p><strong>t.c.</strong>: We go back with our tail between our legs
Harrigan will have our hides.</p>
<p>****: They’ll be coming back – and we’ll be waiting for them.</p>
<p>****: We was supposed to go after them – Thornton reins up, looks at
Coffer, who looks quickly away.</p>
<p><strong>thornton</strong>: You have something to say? Coffer
instantly lifts his hands in submission and shakes his head. Then, after
a moment:</p>
<p><strong>coffer</strong>: They say Freddy Sykes is with them – you
rode with the old man, didn’t you, Mr. Thornton – you and Pike and the
old man? But Thornton rides on and doesn’t answer.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Miha – trigame auga.por los frijolesl The

<p><strong>don jose, angel’s grandfather, watch silently. sykes is
a</strong>: FEW FEET AWAY. Angel watches dully,. his eyes mirroring his
agony. Pike laughs softly, watching.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Hard to believe.</p>
<p><strong>don jose</strong>: Not so hard – we all dream of being
a-child again – even the worst of us – perhaps the worst most of
all..</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: You know us, then –</p>
<p><strong>don jose</strong>: I know myself only – where I have been,
what I have done.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Like to ride with us, old man? And for a
moment, the old man’s eyes flash as he watches: 162- DUTCH AND
THREEVILLAGERS SHOEING a very small, very mean 16L. mule. All four have
been drinking a little and are thoroughly enjoying themselves as is the
mule as he pitches and knocks them all sprawling..</p>
<p><strong>don jose</strong>: – I am too old.</p>
<p>****: .Too old even to ride beside this ancient gringo.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Hell, you ain’t so old; partner.</p>
<p>****: And the soldier. who shot my father what was his name?</p>
<p><strong>don jose</strong>: They were many – who shot – your father
resisted like a man and died like a man – names in this matter have no
importance. I killed one; I lie – I ran –</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Joe –’by God I like you. I like a man who
tells the truth.</p>
<p>****: And the leader – how was he called?</p>
<p><strong>don jose</strong>: Mapache.</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: That is.name enough.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: The Federal. troops they don? t. protect you
–</p>
<p><strong>icon jose</strong>: They were Federal troops; – commissioned
by the traitor Huerta – seven of the village were killed –.our horses
and cattle and corn stolen – all in the name of Huerta, the killer of
our President Francisco I.. Madero – In Mexico, Senor - these are the
years of sadness.</p>
<p>****: And Teresa?</p>
<p><strong>don jose</strong>: Gone.</p>
<p>****: They took her?</p>
<p><strong>don jose</strong>: No – she went with them because she wished
to. She became the woman of Mapache – and others – she went with them
laughing – Drunk with wine and love. Angel, knowing it’s true, turns and
moves away. Pike looks after him.’</p>
<p><strong>167 don jose hands sykes the bottle, sykes drinks, hands it
to</strong>: PIKE who drinks.</p>
<p><strong>don jose</strong>: To him she was a goddess. To be wor-
shipped from afar – with music and flowers – a deity to be followed and
adored at a dis -nee but Mapache -’ knew she was a mango – ripe and
waiting…</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: -So Angel lives with a dream – while Mapache
eats the mango –</p>
<p><strong>don jose</strong>: Just so -</p>
<p>****: You have been there – with the dream?</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Many times – and with the mango too.</p>
<p>****: You just bet he has, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: I never could carry a candle to you, old
timer.</p>
<p><strong>don jose</strong>: And. which do you prefer, the dream or the
taste?</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: I dream when I sleep – and eat when I’m
hungry.</p>
<p><strong>don jose</strong>: Just so • – the both of you and Map-ache
and I –</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: Where is Mapache?;</p>
<p><strong>175 harrigan steps out of the boxcar</strong>: stands
waiting. Coffer’s gun has disappeared.,</p>
<p><strong>thornton</strong>: Ride ahead, all of you. And they do,
riding toward Harrigan as we.,</p>
<p><strong>179 the villagers cheer them on, then two pretty
girls</strong>: JUMP UP and. dance with the- Gorch brothers, learning
the steps from the willing, if surprisingly bashful, teachers.</p>
<p><strong>murmuring of carmalita, a rather plump and quite
pretty</strong>: YOUNG GIRL, seated between him and Dutch. Angel,
across. the fire, raises his voice and repeats the question:.</p>
<p><strong>angel.</strong>: You must tell me.- where Map ache?</p>
<p><strong>181 his grandfather, watching pike and dutch and
carmalita,</strong>: laughing softly to himself, finally turns, his
smile fading.</p>
<p><strong>don jose</strong>: Why do you wish to know – for your father
- or the whore? Pike looks up as Angel fights within himself to find an
answer,</p>
<p>****: It doesn’t make any difference, kid our business is in Agua
Verde For a moment Angel looks like he will explode, then he lifts a
bottle of tequi.lla in salute to Pike.</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: As you say, Jefe - to Agua Verde and ‘our
business.’</p>
<p><strong>dutch</strong>: All soldiers - not a bounty hunter in
sight.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: We’ll go. have a drink, then try and sell the
horses.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: ‘Who’.s going to buy – looks to me like. this
place has been picked clean.</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: He’s been here; 186 THE HORSES PUT THEIR EARS
BACK and whinny nervously as an incredible noise is heard off scene. The
men snap their heads.around and look at:</p>
<p><strong>187 a huge cloud of dust from the edge of t1 014n moving down
the</strong>: STREET towards the plaza. Inside is the almost ghostlike
appearance of a 1912 or 1913 touring car. Four mounted men are riding on
each side and a host of small.children are running, screaming, behind
it.</p>
<p><strong>six men get out and two of them instantly begin
dusting</strong>: AND POLISHING. The mounted guards. take up positions
around the vehicle. The group shows deference to a large man wearing
general’s braid. -EL ’MAPACHE. Next to him is his second in command,
ZAMORRA. The third man dressed in white linen is MOHR, a German military
advisor. With him is ERNST, his aide. 189 PIKE AND THE OTHERS WATCH with
interest as the men enter a cantina-like building. Then without a word
they cross the</p>
<p><strong>189 continued</strong>: street, drawn to the vehicle. Angel
is tense, knowing that his man has arrived.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: I seen one just like this in Waco…</p>
<p><strong>lyle</strong>: Run on steam?</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: No…alcohol:…or gasoline. 190 FREDDY SYKES
EDGES UP CLOSE TO PIKE. He is anxious to make a. statement and he speaks
to him as he walks around the car.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Pike… .I heard about one they got up north
that. kin fly; Pike nods sagely. Te.ctor Gorch on the other side of the
car hears the remark.</p>
<p>****: .That was a balloon ,you damned old fool.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: No,. the old man’s right. They -got t em now
with motors and wings – cover 60 miles in less than an hour…goin’ to use
them in the war, they say. This could cover. 30 miles in an hour – ’
cording to the road, of course.</p>
<p><strong>dutch</strong>: That could run a horse right into the
ground.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Not that easy – these automobiles can’t
stand.any rough ground – or hot sun like a horse —they’re for show
mostly. 191 TECTOR TOUCHES A FENDER AND ONE of the guards spurs toward
him, cursing in Spanish. Tector backs off,. hands in the air.</p>
<p><strong>tector</strong>: I was just going to touch th.,e damn thing,
not marry it.</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: Un gigante de miquina – Ha de tenor una
fuerza tremenda.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: -La fuerza.do 1,000 caballos.</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: Y el dueno – un general por lo menos.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Mapache? Mis que un general - un hombre hecho
para reinar todo Mexico, si Dios quiere.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: You’re here with us,pardner – any business you
got with the general comes after we finish ours – and that is selling
horses..</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: As you wish. He turns away, Pike grabs him,
jerks him back,</p>
<p>**_**: You make.one move to trouble and I’ll -kill you – understand –
we stick together.</p>
<p><strong>dutch</strong>: Angel – who does this thing belong to?</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: Es el carrazo oficial de.su excelencia el
Generalisimo Mapache. Dutch turns smiling and tells the others.</p>
<p><strong>dutch</strong>: The official carrazo of the Pache
Generalisimo. CONTINUED</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Let’s get some beer and talk to the general
about his automobile and our extra horses,,.nice and easy. The men turn
and follow him into the cantina.</p>
<p><strong>193 the cantina is a large many leveled room in a half
destroyed</strong>: HACIENDA FILLED WITH MEXICANS wearing the uniforms
of Huerta,’ s counter-revolutionary army and their ladies,, A small
mariachi band wanders among the. tables. playing folk. songs of the era.
In certain areas horses are stabled.– a blacksmith shop is working, guns
are being repaired, knives and bayonets sharpened..,and food is being
cooked for the troops by their women. Kids, as .always,. are very
evident. 19L. MAPACHE AND HIS GROUP ARE SEATED AT A TABLE which is in’ a
covered area raised above the others. It is obvious from. his position
and respect accorded him that he is the local .boss of the area.’ The
German officer, Mohr, and Ernst, are ’sitting on one side of him.
Lieutenant Zamorra is seated on the other side. Herrera is close by.
1.95. PIKE AND THE OTHERS MOVE TOWARDS A CORNER of the cantina eyeing
the Mexicans with the kind of caution that men who are vastly
outnumbered generally show.. They sit quietly at a table, ignoring the
suspicious looks of the soldiers. 196 AT MAPACHE’S LONG TABLE, the
General and the Germans watch them with pointed interest. Mohr nudges
Mapache and asks who they are. Mapache shr ugs – he doesn’t know, 197
EMMA, A PRETTY WAITRESS, CROSSES TO PIKE’S table to take their
order.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Diga?</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Beers.. six cervesas,</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Como? Angel remains silent, looking at the
General,</p>
<p><strong>dutch</strong>: Seii cervesas. The girl leaves to’ get the
order. The men at the table look around the cantina. At a nearby table a
group of men are throwing dice and laughing loudly. The mariachis are
gather- ing around Mapache.. Lyle shifts in his chair to look at them.
198 MAPACHE IS LAUGHING AND DRINKING. The German. leans close to Zamorra
and speaks in Spanish.</p>
<p><strong>mohr</strong>: Do you know these Americans?</p>
<p><strong>zamorra</strong>: No. The German settles back in his.chair
and. begins placing a cigarette in a holder.</p>
<p><strong>1.99 tector and lyle look suspiciously around at the
mexicans</strong>: in the cantina. The other men tired from the trail
only half listen to them as the girl serves beer.</p>
<p><strong>tector</strong>: Probably talking about us behind our backs.
200 DUTCH TURNS TO PIKE WHO IS QUAFFING a large beer.</p>
<p><strong>dutch</strong>: I’m down to about twenty in silver…</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: The G3neralisimo has cleaned this part a of
the country …He ought to have it to spare.</p>
<p><strong>dutch</strong>: Generalisimo hell – he’s just a damn bandit
grabbing all he can for himself.</p>
<p>****: Like some others I could mention?</p>
<p><strong>dutch</strong>: No sir – we don’t.hang nobody or torture them
– I hope the people here kick him and the rest of the scum like him
right into-their graves.</p>
<p><strong>201 angel sitting quietly with his glass of beer
watches</strong>: MAPACHE, his eyes burning with hatred.</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: We will if it takes a thousand years: Then
suddenly, he reacts to the sound of a girl’s voice off scene.</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: Vamos:…te va. gustar el Alenman: Angel.
spins around in his chair watching as: 202 TWO PRETTY MEXICAN GIRLS,
TERESA AND RASA, laughing and giggling, pass-the table.</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: .Teresa; He reaches out and grabs the better
looking of the two by the arm.</p>
<p><strong>lyle</strong>: Hey,. boy…you know them cuties? Teresa
recognizes him,: then pulls away,</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: Llamo los otros!</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: No, Vete, ahorita vengo; Pike and Dutch
tense as Angel stands and jerks her toward him, -</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Let her go! 203 ANGEL LOOKS AT THE GIRL,
furious and hurt..</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: Djaste el pueblo;</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: Si deje el pinche pueblo. Y ahora vivo con
el generalisimo; She jerks away from Angel and starts toward the other
table.</p>
<p><strong>203 continued</strong>: Angel. watches her go. In the
b.g.,the group of Mariachis playing loudly have moved around Mapache’s
table.. No one there seems. to have seen the action.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Take it easy! He places a hand on Angel’s
shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>dutch</strong>: Que pasa::</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: His sweetheart –</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: “She was my woman and she left the
village.,</p>
<p><strong>20l . teresa splits the mariachis and steps-up beside el
mapache</strong>: and begins kissing his ear..</p>
<p>****: Sure ain’t your woman no more.’</p>
<p><strong>lyle “</strong>: Just look at her licking that, big devil’s
ear. Angel watches, his rage growing, then stands – Pike goes for-him.,
.. but too late..</p>
<p>****: Put a! In a split second he draws and fires.</p>
<p><strong>the bullet from the forty-five catches. her in the
stomach</strong>: and hurls her to the floor. The others at the table
duck for cover, their guns coming out.</p>
<p><strong>206 angel is staring at the girl as pike t”erows a punch
directly</strong>: into the side of his head dropping him onto the
floor, knock- ing him out. The others stand, hands an -theirguns,</p>
<p><strong>are standing with their guns covering pike and the
others.</strong>: Mapache and the’others slowly rise, look at Angel, now
realizing who shot the girl. 208 MAPACHE STARTS TOWARDS THEM. He pushes
over chairs and shoves people aside as he approaches the group. Zamorra9
the Germans and other members of his retinue are close on his heels.</p>
<p><strong>209 pike and the others are silent and unmoving as mapache
steps</strong>: up to the’table and quickly scans the group.. Angel gets
to his knees9 Mapache kicks him in the.head and when Angel. falls back,
stamps him several times with his boot,, steps away. One of Mapache’s
men starts to bash Angel’s head with a rifle` butt,. Mapache stops the
man with a gesture,. then turns to the others.</p>
<p><strong>mapache</strong>: Qua basura es este? Mapache again. kicks
Angel..</p>
<p><strong>zamorra</strong>: Why did he try to kill His Excellency…?</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: He didn’t, he was. after the girl… Mapache is
having difficulty understanding. He looks at Z’amorra with a puzzled
expression.</p>
<p><strong>zamorra</strong>: La.muchacha,..</p>
<p><strong>dutch</strong>: Era su novia; The Mexicans immediately
respond to Dutch’s explanation. Both Z.amorra and Mapache smile.</p>
<p>****: His fiancee??…</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: He went a little crazy when he saw her with
you. Mapache laughs. His ego is pleased with the idea that.he had taken
someone’s woman. He turns and explains grandly in Spanish to the rest
of. the cantina.</p>
<p><strong>ma pa che</strong>: Mato su vieja porque salio con El
Mapache; The soldiers in the cantina laugh and ad lib their
response..</p>
<p><strong>mohr</strong>: Are you men in Agua Verde for business?</p>
<p><strong>pike.</strong>: Thought we might sell a few horses.</p>
<p><strong>mohr</strong>: You must have been associated with the
American Army, is that riot so? Tector and Lyle snicker slightly at the
remark. Mapache and Zamorra turn, listening carefully to the
conversation. The cantina is silent.</p>
<p><strong>dutch</strong>: -No – were not associated with anyone…</p>
<p><strong>mohr</strong>: I see,..1 was curious because of.the equipment
which you are carrying. That pistol is restricted for use’by army
personnel. It can’t be purchased or even owned… legally.</p>
<p>****: Is that so? - -</p>
<p><strong>mohr</strong>: You’re surprised at my interest? Weapons are a
specialty of mine. Mohr bows his head slightly and clicks his heels
barely audib3y,</p>
<p><strong>mohr</strong>: I am Commander Frederick Mohr-of the Imperial
German. Army. For the last six- months I have been in Mexico helping
fight against the revolutionaries. 212. ANGEL ON THE FLOOR IS CONSCIOUS,
but uimoving., listening to what is being said. Several of Mapache’s men
stand around him.</p>
<p><strong>mohr</strong>: Unfortunately your government has chosen to
aid the rabble in their so-called struggle for liberty…</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: I. never heard of any American troops fighting
down here…</p>
<p><strong>mohr</strong>: They are aiding in diplomatic channels… It
would be very useful to us if we knew of Americans who did not share
their government’s naive sentiments.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: We have vez”y’few sentiments in common with
our government.</p>
<p><strong>mapache</strong>: Qua diga?</p>
<p><strong>mohr</strong>: Generalisimo, I think we should ask these
gentlemen to have a drink with us. And Pike, understanding. that much
Spanish, smiles as we.</p>
<p><strong>213 a mariachi is blowing hard and sad into a tiny
brass</strong>: TRUMPET AS he looks at the body of Teresa being dragged
out. Emma and.Rosa’are still very much in evidence.. 214 AT MAPACHE’S
TABLE, PIKE, DUTCH, LYLE, TECTOR AND SYKES are all seated at the raised
table on the dais..,. Mapache seated at one end is tired and looks half
asleep,. In the b.g. Angel can be seen still on the floor. A couple of
guards are sitting near him. 2,15 SEVERAL MARS. ARE SPREAD OUT on the

is dragged through a door at one end of the room. Zamorra is seated.next
to the German listening intently,</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Of all those garrison rail spurs that ofie is
the easiest to hit – But I’ve got to figure where we can get out with.
the wagon.</p>
<p><strong>dftch</strong>: Why do you want us to hit a train that’s so
close to the border …The General could take an army up there and get
it.</p>
<p><strong>mohr</strong>: President Huerta is anxious to better
relations with the U.S. – not destroy them. -</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Arms shipments are generally. kept secret …how
did you find out about this one?</p>
<p><strong>ernst</strong>: Mapache has a superb intelligence force..
Organized under the supervision of my superior officer.</p>
<p><strong>zamorra</strong>: Gentlemen., we are quite well organized and
well able to pay $10,000 in gold. If you are not able to do the work we
will find someone else,</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: ’ I – we can do ’it , , ,</p>
<p>****: But we’re going to need special equipment.</p>
<p><strong>zamorra</strong>: Our accountant will arrange everything.</p>
<p><strong>sohr</strong>: Soon you will be the best armed general in
Mexico. Mapache raises his glass In a toast,</p>
<p><strong>mapache</strong>: A la conquistat.,. Pike nudges Lyle who
raises his glass; the other men follow suit. Mohr smiles and elegantly
raises a drink.</p>
<p><strong>ernst</strong>: Prosit:a I 217 PIKE AND DUTCH.DRINK, put down
their glasses.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: With your permission …I need a bath.</p>

need’some of them senoritas. How ’bout that boy, can you fix us up?</p>
<p><strong>zamorra</strong>: Porque no? Zamorra yells to JUAN. JOSE, an
aide, standing nearby.</p>
<p><strong>zamorra</strong>: Oye!…Traeles unas viejas! Andale!</p>
<p>****: Gentlemen, you will excuse me, I’m sure.</p>
<p><strong>dutch</strong>: I’m sure. 219 DUTCH FOLLOWS PIKE TO ANGEL
where they lift him off the floor.</p>

<p><strong>pike</strong>: Por favor, General – but I need him.</p>
<p><strong>mapache</strong>: I”give you someone much better.</p>
<p>****: I choose my own… withyour permission. Zamorra joins Mapache,
looks at Pike whose hand is close to his. gun, turns to the General.</p>
<p><strong>-zamorra</strong>: Mi jefe, deje que se lo lleven.. Mapache
replaces his gun.</p>
<p><strong>mapa che</strong>: Take him. It is not important to me – take
him!’ Then he.looks away as:</p>

delight.</p>
<p><strong>tector</strong>: Hey! …Here come our sweeties!</p>
<p><strong>lyle</strong>: More than enough to go around… And then some!
He turns” and beckons to Pike and Dutch who, with Sykes, are carrying
Angel out of the saloon, but they ignore him.</p>
<p><strong>222 harrigan and thornton are seated at a table studying
payroll</strong>: SCHEDULES. MUNITION SCHEDULES AND NAPS. The other
bounty hunters are scattered around the car grumbling about the
inaction.</p>
<p><strong>harrigan</strong>: And you want to gamble everything this one
shipment will be attacked?!</p>
<p><strong>thornton</strong>: If they’re in Agua Verde that’s what -
–they’ll go for.</p>
<p><strong>harrigan</strong>: If?! Why not Juarez?</p>
<p><strong>thornton</strong>: Because we would have heard::. If they are
in Agua Verde they will have seen Mapache.</p>
<p>****: And.who in the hell_is Mapache?</p>
<p><strong>thornton</strong>: A killer for Huerta who calls himself
a.general.– with enough guns he can become a power in northern Mexico -
my guess is Pike will try and get them f or • him.</p>
<p><strong>harrigan</strong>: The train will be guarded by regular
troops!!</p>
<p><strong>thornton</strong>: Not regulars –.green recruits and not.
worth a damn! I’ll need twenty trained men – not recruits or this gutter

<p><strong>harrigan</strong>: You’ll get the job done with what you have
– that’p our bargain.</p>
<p>****: Twenty-four days.</p>
<p><strong>223 continued</strong>: GENTER OF AN ADOBE STEAM HUT. The
structure is about twenty- five feet in diameter with a small. open oven
in the center surrounded by a great deal of rocks. Light comes in
through a tiny hole in the center of the ceiling which also allows smoke
to escape. PIKE, ANGEL AND DUTCH are sitting on a bench against one
wall. Angel has been cleaned up, but looks beaten. 225 SYKES IS IN ONE
CORNER, thoroughly enjoying himself. The men are all nude and stark
white against the mud.’ color of the walls. As the woman exits, Dutch
stands and empties a bucket of water over’ himself -and the others. They
all gasp with relief. All have towels around their waists and none are
completely sober. Pike’s leg is heavily scarred and he is in pain. He
stands and drinks, gets closer to the fire9 massaging his leg.</p>
<p><strong>dutch</strong>: I don’t see how you stand it</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Some day I’m going to build me one of these
and live in it. I don’t know why I • didn’ t just let him kill you.</p>
<p>****: I’m not going to steal guns for that devil to rob and kill my
people again.</p>
<p><strong>dutch</strong>: Very ’noble .</p>
<p><strong>syre s</strong>: I didn’t see no tears runnin’ down your face
when you rode in from San Rafael.</p>
<p>****: They were not my people – nor yours – I care about my people,
my villag.e, Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>65a.</strong>: 226 ANGEL GETS UP OFF THE BENCH and dumps a
bucket of water on his head. Pike looks at. Dutch. Both drink from a
bottle.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Listen, bog, you ride the trail with us your
village don’t count – if it does- -you jest don’t go along.</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: Then I don’t go along!</p>
<p><strong>dutch</strong>: One load of guns isn’t going to stop him from
raiding villages.. You ought to be thinking about all that money you’ll
have.</p>
<p>****: Take them a large bag of gold when it’s over.</p>
<p><strong>dutch</strong>: A small bag.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Move them a thousand miles away and buy them a
ranch –. two – three, ranches.</p>
<p><strong>dutch</strong>: One – a very Small ranch.</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: They’ll never leave…You see, it’s their land
– and no one will, ever drive them away.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: , I’ll drink to that sentiment – and to. love
– But when all is said and done – I!11 drink to – gold.</p>
<p><strong>dutch</strong>: Salud’.</p>
<p><strong>lyle</strong>: The dons of Spain built-this some three
hundred years ago – He belches, then looks about in awe at the huge
casks.</p>
<p><strong>tector</strong>: Itm all for them dons’. 229 TECTOR SUDDENLY
SWINGS A MATTOX ON TO a six foot cask which rests on top of two others
of equal height, it bounces out of his hand. He draws his gun and fires
as does Lyle. Liquid gushes down. 229A LYLE STEPS UNDER IT, lifts his
face, drinks, then drags: his lady beside him.</p>
<p><strong>lyle</strong>: over them removing his</p>
<p>****: Have a dollop, honey – there’s enough here for both of us. And.
she does, tasting the good wine:; laughing.</p>
<p><strong>230 pike and dutch exchange looks and have another drink,
as</strong>: ANGEL PALES.. Both are ready to write Angel off. and forget
about the problem.</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: Would you give someone a gun to kill your
mother, or your father, or your brother? 231, DUTCH LOOKS AT PIKE. Pike
thinks it over. Both have. another pull on the bottle.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Son – twenty thousand cuts a lot of. family
ties.</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: No – you gringos are no different. I have
seen how Lyle takes care of his brother. He takes the bottle, drinks,
then throws it on the rocks.</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: My people don’t have guns so Mapache takes
the food out of their mouths and clothes off their backs. With guns my
village could fight, If I could take guns to my people I would go with
you – but not just for gold, 232 THE MEN ARE MOMENTARILY SILENT. Angel
lifts a bucket of water, spills part of it on his head, passes it to
Sykes who drinks a little of the water, spits it out, puts the bucket
down, pours two bottles of tequilla into it, drinks. again – smiles,
passes it to Angel, who drinks and passes it on.</p>
<p>****: .Al]. we’d need is for El Mapache to find out we armed some
village…</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Let him find out.’ Mr. Bishop – You know as
well as I there ain’t no way of collecting from Mapache ’cept off a lot
of dead bodies – mostly ours, the way he thinks. Pike considers this –
looks at the old man, finally nods .</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: I would take guns …if Mapache found out, you
would say I stole them,</p>
<p><strong>dutch</strong>: How many cases of rifles did Zamorra say were
in that shipment?</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Twenty.</p>
<p><strong>dutch</strong>: Give him one.</p>
<p><strong>pike’</strong>: You can have one case and one case of ammo,
You’ll give up your share of the gold.</p>
<p><strong>dutch</strong>: __-He’ll have to show up with us. when we
deliver..,.</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: I’ will:..</p>
<p>****: i. know. you will… Then. they all turn as: 233 TECTOR AND.LYLE
AND THEIR LADIES enter, somewhat wet and stained with wine.</p>
<p><strong>lyle.</strong>: ’ I’ d like. you to meet my fiancee.</p>
<p><strong>tector</strong>: They just got engaged.</p>
<p><strong>234 for a moment the group</strong>: is frozen,-looking at
the.bride to be, her bridesmaid and:the best man. and groom,.. then all
stand., together and bow.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Pleasure-, Ma’ ain.</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: Tanto gusto, senorita.</p>
<p><strong>dutch</strong>: Mucho gusto, senorita..</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: . Son of a bitch.</p>
<p>****: Trot them on in, boys – I’ :m hell on packin’ mules, but I’m ’a
delight with, .a pretty girl.</p>
<p><strong>234 continued</strong>: Tector and Lyle and their girls look
at him as both Pike and Dutch nearly fall off the bench, laughing too
hard to drink their health as we:</p>
<p><strong>235 pike and dutch are riding ahead of a large.
wagon</strong>: DRIVEN BY SYKES. The others are riding. behind. The
walls of the arroyo tower above the men. Pike is tense in the saddle as
the pain in. his leg becomes almost. unbearable.</p>
<p><strong>dutch</strong>: You never told me how you got all tore up
like that… 236 PIKE REFLECTS FOR A MOMENT. His face is almost white.;
Then he reaches in his saddle bag and pulls out a bottle. He drinks,
passes the bottle to Dutch..</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: I met a woman I wanted to marry… Pike ’grins a
little at what now seems an absurd thought.</p>
<p><strong>236a superimposed over the. scene is pike in
juarez:</strong>: INT. KITCHEN v NIGHT</p>
<p><strong>236b pike. comes in through the kitchen-door with an arm
load</strong>: of groceries and too much to drink. 236C AURORA STANDS
WAITING FOR HIM. She is very beautiful and very angry..</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Buenas no the s mi amor. Aurora swings and
catches him full handed across the face9 the groceries scatter on the
floor – Pike bounces off the wall,. looks at her, tries to grin.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Your husband due back?</p>
<p><strong>aurora</strong>: No, never you are late – two days late. Pike
is startled by this, starts to protest, realizes it is true, tries to
make apologies. Aurora turns and stalks off.</p>
<p>****: You need help?.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: No! He picks up a pan with a hot handle, drops
it, spilling hot stew or soup on his foot, hops around cursing looking
at the shambles on the stove and on the floor.’ 236DD AURORA STANDS
LOOKING AT HIM WITH LOVE, then smiling softly crosses to the side-board
and pours him a drink. He takes it, suddenly both are laughing.</p>
<p><strong>pike and aurora stand in the semidarkness slowly
disrobing.</strong>: Suddenly Pike embraces her and pulls her to the
bed. They begin to make love, then: THE DOOR SMASHES OUN AND LUKE, a
skinny bad mouthed Texan steps into the room, a_double barreled shot gun
in his hands ready to fire. AURORA SCREAMS and throws herself in front
of Pike. Luke fires, the charge killing her as Pike dives out of bed –
jumping for his gun on a nearby table. LUKE FIRES AGAIN, the blast
catching Pike across the thigh and knee. Pike goes down. Luke crosses to
the bed and sits watching him writhing almost bleeding to death on the
floor.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: She had a husband and I should have had enough
sense to kill him. He wasn’t around and I got careless. One night
he.walked in on us - - got her with the first shot. He caught me here
with the second then the damndd coward turned and ran.</p>
<p><strong>dutch</strong>: You didn’t catch up with him?</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Not yet but there-hasn’t been.a day or an hour
that I haven’t thought about getting him - - he didn’t want that woman
he just. wanted to kill somebody - - well, he killed her - - not me and
I’ll see him dead for it.</p>
<p><strong>i</strong>: Move along, Freddy - - we’ve got a long way to
go: He turns back to Dutch, takes the bottle,.. drinks deeply and puts
it away.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: This is the last go round - - this time we do
it right.</p>
<p><strong>239 in front of the engine two army ordinance guards ride

horse quickly follows. Dutch turns and yells.</p>
<p><strong>dutch</strong>: They’re coming; 269 GORCH ON FRONT OF THE.
LOCOMOTIVE WHIRLS AROUND and looks back for an instant as Dutch yells.
The two guards jump for their weapons. Lyle turns back,’watches them,

crates. A second shot catches him in the small of the back, hurling him
over the edge of the car. 283 ANGEL RUSHES FORWARD, and bracing himself
on a stanchion, grabs Dutch by the jacket and pulls him aboard.</p>
<p>****: Order; Dammit;,..Corporal9 get those —men out of that car,

<p><strong>bounty hunters.</strong>: 286 THORNTON LEADING HIS MEN IS
ABOUT a mile and a half behi^c. the train.</p>
<p><strong>287 the train nears a wagon road with a narrow bridge
that</strong>: CROSSES IT AND SUDDENLY the wheels lock. With a shower of
sparks it slides to a stop beside:” 288 A LARGE WAGON ON THE RIVERSIDE
OF THE CROSSING. The bandits scramble off the train and begin loading
cases of guns onto the waiting wagon. Sykes and Tector Gorch assist,
them. The wagon is directly beside the car and the unload- ing is very
rapid.</p>
<p><strong>289 pike climbs to the top of the-.cab watching:</strong>:
290 THE CLOUD OF DUST OF THE APPROACHING BOUNTY HUNTERS. He yells down
to the men:</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Get the guns off and get on, out of here; He
turns and scrambles down inside the cab. Outside the men quickly finish
loading and the wagon pulls up alongside the cab.</p>
<p><strong>dutch</strong>: We’re ready!</p>

He.•yanks the throttle into reverse and jumps off the locomotive onto
the wagon.</p>

robbery.</p>
<p><strong>they. have. pre-rigged a cable crossing.</strong>: In perfect
order Dutch and Angel begin attaching the ropes to-the tongue of the
wagon as Sykes unhitches.</p>
<p><strong>as the train rushes past.</strong>: 29l� WITH ANGEL LEADING,
THE..HORSES ARE PULLED into the river. Large barrels on the side of the
wagon serve as floatation gear. The current catches it and begins to
swing it on the rope downstream and across the river.. 295 THE BOUNTY
HUNTERS ARE RAPIDLY CLOSING THE GAP. In the distance. they can see the
bandits, now in mid-stream, 296 OUTSIDE THE CATTLE CAR, RECRUITS ARE
LINED UP saddling their horses.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Sergeant; They’re coming back…</p>
<p>****: Get those horses away from the car!. Get them out of there;</p>
<p><strong>300 inside the car, the men have caught and saddled one
horse.</strong>: Which.is now bucking, the saddle hanging under its
belly. The other rears as the Sergeant yells again.</p>
<p><strong>mc hale</strong>: Get out ; …The engine’s coming ! And It is
at about forty miles an hour. The Sergeant turns and runs.</p>
<p><strong>303 in the cattle car, horses and 14en are hurled around

<p><strong>others.</strong>: 307 PIKE ROPES ONTO THE’ WAGON FROM the

DUTCH is next-to him, lying prone. on the wagon returning the fire of
the bounty hunters.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Get on those rear. wheels’. The Gorch brothers
scramble down into knee-deep water and begin to push.</p>
<p><strong>310 dutch aims and fires.</strong>: 311 A MAN STAGGERS OUT
from half cover and drops to his knees, 312 DUTCH FIRES AGAIN and
another man drops. The bounty hunters back up.and hunt better cover.</p>

bridge.,.</strong>: puffs on the cigar watching, Thornton..</p>
<p><strong>314 in the river below the bridge, pike and his men push
and</strong>: heave against the wagon slowly moving. it up onto-the
bank. Then: 314A SEEING THORNTON STARTING ACROSS THE BRIDGE, PIKE raises
his.rifle but the range is far and the wagon has begun to move. 315
THORNTON FORCES his terrified animal across the tottering structure,
then whirls as a bullet whines past his head. The shot has come from
behind. Above and through the trees he can see: 316 THE CAVALRY
DISMOUNTING AND CONTINUING to fire. 317 THE BOUNTY HUNTERS WHIRL around
and return the-fire.</p>
<p>****: Don’t shoot; …It’s the army, you idiots; - But his words are
drowned out in a volley-of firing. Some of the soldiers start for the
bridge. Three or four of the bounty hunters quickly mount and spur on to
the bridge after Thornton.</p>
<p><strong>328 beneath the bridge, the two fuses reac.e the dynamite and

hunters into the river,</p>

satisfaction.</strong>: Finally both turn and ride after the wagon
followed by scat- tered ineffective shots of the soldiers,</p>
<p><strong>330 on the far side of the river, mc hale stops a group of

Co Well, I’m sure as hell going to steal me a horse; 333 THORNTON IS
STANDING ON THE EDGE OF THE CLEARING looking at the men around the f
ire. He is tired and has obviously ridden a long way, and shows the
affects of the explosions ripped clothes, a bloody gash on his face – a
twisted knee that is bad enough to make him limp through the remainder
of the film.</p>

INTO THE SADDLE, the pain twisting his face. For- a long moment no one
moves, then: LYLE FULLS. A BOTTLE out of his. jumper, hands it to Pike.
34- Pike drinks, hands it’to Sykes who drunks, hands it to Angel who
drinks,. hands it with a touch of a smile to Tector who hesitates, then
half grins himself; drinks and hands it to Lyle. Lyle looks at the
bottle, upends it over his mouth, a few drops spill out into his mouth,
looks at the bottle in disbelief, tosses it gently aside.</p>

<p><strong>r</strong>: 349 DUTCH IS LYING PRONE BEHIND SOME ROCKS trying
a paper cone over the front of a pair of U.S. Army binoculars. Pike
stands beside him, With the cone adjusted he rolls over and looks out
across the valley plain broken with arroyos.</p>
<p><strong>dutch</strong>: Still heading east.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Are they bluffing. or did they really miss
it?</p>
<p><strong>dutch</strong>: I’d say they missed it..</p>
<p><strong>i</strong>: 352 THE WAGON IS BELOW THEM hidden in a gully.
The other men are lounging underneath it. Pieces of brush are tied
behind the rear wheels of the wagon to brush away the trail. Pike and
Dutch stand and move back toward the wagon.</p>
<p><strong>dutch</strong>: Only five left – didn’t figure them to come
down after us. How much can we be worth?</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: A lot depends on how hungry they are…</p>
<p>****: You- stay up there and look for bighats.,..I’m going to start.
..’rigging the fireworks. Dutch: turns, crawls back and lifts the
glassese Pikewalk down near the wagon and. prods. Angel., who.is
sleeping _: his boot.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: 1. need some-help. 353 ANGEL QUICKLY GETS TO
HIS FEET and follows Pike. to the wagon. Pike reaches into a box near
the seat and removes a piece of fuse.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Get that case of explosives near the back.
Angel climbs on the wagon. Lyle, hearing him,.crawls out from
underneath. His brother also awakens and starts moving around. Sykes,
hat. over his eyes, looks up but doesn’t move..</p>
<p><strong>lyle</strong>: Whatta you want with the dynamite?</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Protection.</p>
<p>****: I figure the General will plan to collect without payment, then
kill us if we have. any objections. The only reason he might change his
mind is if something could happen to these guns.</p>
<p><strong>353 continued</strong>: Angel hands Pike a case of
explosives.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Now I’m goin’ to make it real easy for
something to happen. 35L PIKE SETS THE BOX ON THE GROUND and pries open
the lid. He begins setting the sticks on the ground next to the box.
Angel gets down and Pike hands.him a coil. of baling wire.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Wrap these in pairs and put a fuse cap between
them. Angel takes the first two and starts to work on them. 355 LYLE
WATCHES FOR A MOMENT THEN NUDGES HIS BROTHER and climbs on the wagon and
begins looking over the.boxes… One is much bigger than the others and of
a different shape. 356 ANGEL AND PIKE ARM THE DYNAMITE STICKS in the
shade of the wagon..</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: Men from my village will meet us tomorrow.
Pike looks up, angered.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: You told them about our trail?</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: I. don’t need to tell them…They know where we
are.</p>
<p><strong>pike’</strong>: How? Angel puts the charge down and looks off
at the horizon.</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: This country has many people, but they have
learned to live without being seen. Anyplace where a farmer has a field
…or a man has sheep in the moun-•- .tains..or a boy watches a herd of
goats.</p>
<p><strong>356 continued</strong>: - There is a noise off screen and
they both look up, 357 TECTOR AND LYLE, using the heavy-bladed Bowie
knives, have pried open the strange shaped box. Lyle, his eyes bright,
reaches in..</p>
<p><strong>tector</strong>: Pike – take–a look –</p>
<p><strong>lyle</strong>: -You know how to work one of these things?
Pike stands,,then grins a little-and crosses to the wagon.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: .Whatever I don’t know, I’m going to
learn.</p>
<p><strong>jess</strong>: I don’t know how we lost ’em except maybe in
that big valley where the ground was. so hard.</p>
<p><strong>coffer</strong>: There wasn’t but one way they could have
taken a wagon out of there, this here is it.</p>
<p><strong>thornton</strong>: They didn.’t take it out…</p>
<p><strong>t.c.</strong>: We, ain’t gonna make it too much further
without something to eat.</p>
<p>****: We didn’t lose them – I could point to them now. Sit still,
dammitl You think Pike and old Sykes haven’t been watching us – you
think if we hadn’t.turned off they wouldn’t just have sat back and let
us walk into it – six of them hid and all the. guns.and ammunition they
need – you think I wasn’t sweating blood they wouldn’t try and hide
their trail! They look at him silently, almost frightened by his
vehemeno e</p>
<p><strong>thornton</strong>: They know what this is all about – and.
what. do I have – nothin’ but you damned egg sucking chicken stealing
gutter rats – with less than 60 rounds of ammunition be- tween you,</p>
<p><strong>t.c.</strong>: Listen, Mr. Thornton – I don’t have to take
any talk like that.</p>
<p><strong>jess</strong>: I don’t neither;</p>
<p><strong>thornton</strong>: You’ll take it! You don’t even have enough
sense to keep your damned boots on. We’re after men’ – and I wish to God
I was with them. You make any more mistakes and I’m going to ride off
and let you die. They are silent looking at the ground – after a moment,
Thornton turns his horse and rides off slowly. They follow.</p>

PIKE SLIDES INTO THE FRONT SEAT NEXT TO..SYKES.. Without a word,. Sykes
lights his cheroot and Pike. reaches behind him and takes the end of a
fuse. Angel and Dutch let their rifles drift over.</p>
<p><strong>dutch</strong>: Mapache’ s?</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Just hope. they don’t belong to Villa.</p>
<p><strong>3614. herrera, the leader of the mexicans, walks his horse a

bring love and affection from el general – We are comrades – you and he
– all of us. 365 PIKE, DUTCH AND THE OTHERS watch silently as he rides
up to the wagon. 366 HERRERA STOPS AND REMOVES HIS HAT’, smiles, looks
at. the heavily loaded wagon.</p>
<p><strong>herrera</strong>: Que bueno – What bravery you. have.to have
done this magnifi cent act for the liberty of Mexico. Angel laughs,
spits, Herrera.looks at him for a moment, smiles, shrugs, turns to
Pike.</p>
<p><strong>herrera</strong>: I am to escort you to the general. 367
NOBODY ANSWERS AND NONE OF THE GUNS pointed at him are lowered, he seems
undisturbed.</p>
<p><strong>herrera</strong>: Tell me what is you wish?</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Tell him to-come closer!</p>
<p><strong>herrera</strong>: I hear – I am coming,- my friend.</p>

you-damn gringos… So nobody can rob the guns!</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Nobody:..nunca nadiel</p>
<p><strong>dutch</strong>: Don’t you think you should tell your
soldiers? The Mexican makes a face as if he doesn’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>herrera</strong>: Why? I am not afraid,,,they are not afraid

<p><strong>angel</strong>: My people are here for the guns. Pike looks
at him then looks around the camp.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Where? Angel smiles, then turns and calls
softly.</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: Ignacio?…Quien hablas por mi pueblo?
Distinctly Indian voices answer from the surrounding tangled

<p><strong>angel</strong>: They apologize and ask you to forgive them
for their lack of trust but only by caution do they remain alive –</p>
<p><strong>tector</strong>: Hell, I forgive them! I just want to join
’em! 389 PIKE JOINS DUTCH AND THEY WATCH quietly.. They have mis-
trusted people for so long themselve,g they can understand mistrust in
others. Freddy Sykes laughs s.oi’tly. 390 ANGEL AND THE INDIANS cross to
the wagonE:</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: Lievas•una caja de rifles.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Don’t break that fuse… Angel lifts a
crate.</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: I won’t. Pike looks at Ignacio waiting to
take the crate, the man’s machete glints in the moonlight.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: They part of your village?</p>
<p><strong>angel -</strong>: They are part of the village but not from
it – they are puro indio – and these mountains belong to them.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: How long have they been around?</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: What ?</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: How long have they been following us… close?
391 ANGEL EASES THE RIFLE CRATE DOWN, TWO PEONS TAKE IT. He turns to
Ignacio.</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: Cuanto tiempo nos sigas?</p>

CASES ON THE BURRO. They work smoothly, each man knowing his job. Angel.
climbs down off the wagon, murmurs a farewell to Ignacio and the others,
and they disappear into the shadows.</p>
<p><strong>393 the fuse burns down on a sky rocket and the missile
shoots</strong>: INTO, THE AIR AND EXPLODES. A burst of laughter
follows. 39LE. MAPACHE AND HIS MEN are playing with fireworks while they
wait for the guns.</p>
<p><strong>395 two soldiers drag forward a peon</strong>: . One of them
waves aloft a shotgun and tells Mapache that it belonged to the man..
Mapache, com- pletely absorbed in lighting a Roman candle, answers
without turning.</p>

<p><strong>zamorra</strong>: Trae la caja!</p>

<p><strong>pike</strong>: Quicker I get back, the quicker the next

on the ground he opens it and counts out two small bags of gold, and
hands them to Zamorra. Zamorra hands them to Pike.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: About two.. miles up the arroyo … three cases
of rifles, one of ammunition, are in the brush behind it.</p>
<p><strong>zamorra</strong>: Trae las armas Herrera runs for his
horse.</p>
<p><strong>mohr</strong>: I understand you have a machinegun</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Our contract was 16 cases of rifles and 8 of
ammunition – for $10,000 – not a machine gun. It is our gift to the
General.</p>

soldiers.</p>

horses.</p>

<p><strong>thornton</strong>: Your problem.. He turns his horse and
rides away,. the others following, 439 SYKES, HIDDEN IN THE ROCKS and
brush above them,•slowly lowers his rifle and sags back. His leg is dark
with dried blood and he’s weak. Around the wound is a crude bandage made
from his shirt – with a tourniquet twisted tightly above it. After a
moment, there is a noise and he looks away at:</p>

indistinct</strong>: AGAINST THE RAYS of the late afternoon sun, a
machete dangling from his hand.</p>
